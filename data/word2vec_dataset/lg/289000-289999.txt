 = = = Retirement and death = = = 
 Wiesenthal received many death threats over the years . After a bomb placed by neo @-@ Nazis exploded outside his house in Vienna on 11 June 1982 , police guards were stationed outside his home 24 hours a day . Cyla found the stressful nature of her husband 's career and the dragged @-@ out legal matters regarding Kreisky to be overwhelming , and she sometimes suffered from depression . 
 Wiesenthal spent time at his office at the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime in Vienna even as he approached his ninetieth birthday . The last Nazi he had a hand in bringing to trial was Untersturmführer Julius Viel , who was convicted in 2001 of shooting seven Jewish prisoners . Cyla died on 10 November 2003 , at age 95 . Wiesenthal retired shortly afterward . " I have survived them all . If there were any left , they 'd be too old and weak to stand trial today . My work is done , " said Wiesenthal . Wiesenthal died on 20 September 2005 , at age 96 , and was buried in Herzliya , Israel . He is survived by his daughter , <unk> Kreisberg , and three grandchildren . 
 In a statement on Wiesenthal 's death , Council of Europe chairman Terry Davis said , " Without Simon Wiesenthal 's relentless effort to find Nazi criminals and bring them to justice , and to fight anti @-@ Semitism and prejudice , Europe would never have succeeded in healing its wounds and reconciling itself . He was a soldier of justice , which is indispensable to our freedom , stability and peace . " 
 In 2010 the Austrian and Israeli governments jointly issued a commemorative stamp honouring Wiesenthal . He had been a lifelong stamp collector , and his collection sold at auction for nearly € 500 @,@ 000 after his death . 
 = = Dramatic portrayals = = 
 Wiesenthal was portrayed by Israeli actor Shmuel <unk> in the film adaptation of Frederick Forsyth 's The Odessa File ( 1974 ) . After the film 's release , Wiesenthal received many reports of sightings of the subject of the film , Eduard <unk> , commandant of the Riga Ghetto . These sightings proved to be false alarms , but in 1977 a person living in Buenos Aires who saw the movie reported to police that <unk> was living nearby . The fugitive escaped to Paraguay , where he died of a heart attack a month later . In Ira Levin 's novel The Boys from Brazil , the character of Yakov Liebermann ( called Ezra Liebermann and played by Laurence Olivier in the film ) is modelled on Wiesenthal . Olivier visited Wiesenthal , who offered advice on how to play the role . Wiesenthal attended the film 's New York premiere in 1978 . Ben Kingsley portrayed him in the HBO film Murderers Among Us : The Simon Wiesenthal Story ( 1989 ) . 
 Wiesenthal has been the subject of several documentaries . The Art of Remembrance : Simon Wiesenthal was produced in 1994 by filmmakers Hannah Heer and Werner <unk> for River Lights Pictures . The documentary I Have Never Forgotten You : The Life and Legacy of Simon Wiesenthal , narrated by Nicole Kidman , was released by Moriah Films in 2007 . Wiesenthal is a one @-@ person show written and performed by Tom Dugan that premiered in 2014 . 
 = = Autobiographical inconsistencies = = 
 Wiesenthal wrote a number of books , some of which contain conflicting stories and tales , many of which were invented . Several authors , including Segev and British author Guy Walters , feel that Wiesenthal 's autobiographies are not reliable sources of information about his life and activities . For example , Wiesenthal would describe two people fighting over one of the lists he had prepared of survivors of the Holocaust ; the two look up and recognise each other and have a tearful reunion . In one account it is a man and wife , and in another telling it is two brothers . Wiesenthal 's memoirs variously claim he had spent time in as many as eleven concentration camps ; the actual number was five . A drawing he made in 1945 that he claimed was a scene he witnessed in Mauthausen had actually been sketched from photos that appeared in Life magazine that June . He particularly over @-@ emphasised his role in the capture of Eichmann , claiming that he prevented Veronika Eichmann from having her husband declared dead in 1947 , when in fact the declaration was denied " at the instigation of the authorities . " Wiesenthal said that he had retained his Eichmann file when he sent his research materials to Yad Vashem in 1952 ; in fact he sent all his materials there , and it was his counterpart , Tuviah Friedman in Vienna , who had retained materials on Eichmann . Isser Harel , director of the Mossad at the time , has stated that Wiesenthal had no role in the capture of Eichmann . 
 Walters and Segev both noted inconsistencies between Wiesenthal 's stories and his actual achievements . Segev concluded that Wiesenthal " lied as often as he did " because of his storytelling nature and survivor guilt . Daniel Finkelstein described Walters ' research in Hunting Evil as impeccable and quoted Ben <unk> : " Accepting that Wiesenthal was a showman and a braggart and , yes , even a liar , can live alongside acknowledging the contribution he made " .

 = Crag martin = 
 The crag martins are four species of small passerine birds in the genus Ptyonoprogne of the swallow family . They are the Eurasian crag martin ( P. rupestris ) , the pale crag martin ( P. obsoleta ) , the rock martin ( P. fuligula ) and the dusky crag martin ( P. concolor ) . They are closely related to each other , and have formerly sometimes been considered to be one species . They are closely related to the Hirundo barn swallows and are placed in that genus by some authorities . These are small swallows with brown upperparts , paler underparts without a breast band , and a square tail with white patches . They can be distinguished from each other on size , the colour shade of the upperparts and underparts , and minor plumage details like throat colour . They resemble the sand martin , but are darker below , and lack a breast band . 
 These are species of craggy mountainous habitats , although all three will also frequent human habitation . The African rock martin and the south Asian dusky crag martin are resident , but the Eurasian crag martin is a partial migrant ; birds breeding in southern Europe are largely resident , but some northern breeders and most Asian birds are migratory , wintering in north Africa or India . They do not normally form large breeding colonies , but are more gregarious outside the breeding season . These martins build neat mud nests under cliff overhangs or in crevices in their mountain homes , and have readily adapted to the artificial cliffs provided by buildings and motorway bridges . Up to five eggs , white with dark blotches at the wider end , may be laid , and a second clutch is common . Ptyonoprogne martins feed mainly on insects caught in flight , and patrol cliffs near the breeding site with a slow hunting flight as they seek their prey . They may be hunted by falcons and infected with mites and fleas , but their large ranges and populations mean that none of the crag martins are considered to be threatened , and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The four Ptyonoprogne species are the Eurasian crag martin ( P. rupestris ) described as Hirundo rupestris by Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1769 , the pale crag martin ( P. obsoleta ) , described by Jean Cabanis in 1850 , the rock martin ( P. fuligula ) , described by German zoologist Martin Lichtenstein in 1842 , and the dusky crag martin ( P. concolor ) formally described in 1832 as Hirundo concolor by British soldier and ornithologist William Henry Sykes . They were moved to the new genus Ptyonoprogne by German ornithologist Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach in 1850 . The genus name is derived from the Greek ptuon ( φτυον ) , " a fan " , referring to the shape of the opened tail , and Procne ( Πρόκνη ) , a mythological girl who was turned into a swallow . 
 These are members of the swallow family of birds , and are placed in the Hirundininae subfamily which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins . DNA sequence studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae , broadly correlating with the type of nest built . The groups are the " core martins " including burrowing species like the sand martin , the " nest @-@ adopters " , which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities , and the " mud nest builders " . Ptyonoprogne species construct a mud nest and therefore belong to the latter group ; They resemble the Hirundo species in that they make open cup nests , whereas Delichon martins build closed cups , and the Cecropis and Petrochelidon swallows , have retort @-@ like closed nests with an entrance tunnel . The genus Ptyonoprogne is closely related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo into which it is often subsumed , but a DNA analysis showed that a coherent enlarged Hirundo genus should contain all the mud @-@ builder genera . Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow , the DNA research showed that if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus , as is normally the case , Cecropis , Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off . 
 The small , pale northern subspecies of crag martin found in the mountains of North Africa and the Arabian peninsula is now usually split as the pale crag martin , Ptyonoprogne obsoleta . The remaining birds are now identified as Eurasian crag martin . 
 = = Description = = 
 These martins are 12 – 15 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) long with drab brown or grey plumage and a short square tail that has small white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers . The eyes are brown , the small bill is mainly black , and the legs are brownish @-@ pink . The sexes are similar , but juveniles show pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers . The species differ in plumage shades and size , Eurasian crag martin being significantly larger than the others . The flight is slow , with rapid wing beats interspersed with flat @-@ winged glides . The songs of these birds are simple <unk> , and contact calls include a high @-@ pitched twee or chi , chi , and a <unk> or trrt call like that of the house martin . 
 These drab martins can only be confused with each other , or with sand martins of the genus Riparia . Even the smaller Ptyonoprogne species are slightly larger and more robust than the sand martin and brown @-@ throated sand martin , and have the white tail spots which are absent from the Riparia martins . Where the ranges of Ptyonoprogne species overlap , the Eurasian crag martin is darker , browner and 15 % larger than the rock martin , and larger and paler , particularly on its underparts , than the dusky crag martin . The white tail spots of the Eurasian crag martin are significantly larger than those of both its relatives . In the east of its range , the rock martin always has lighter , more contrasted underparts than the dusky crag martin . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 These are exclusively Old World species . The rock martin breeds throughout Africa and through the Middle East as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan , and is replaced by the dusky crag martin further east in India and Indochina . The Eurasian crag martin breeds from Iberia and northwesternmost Africa through southern Europe , the Persian Gulf and the Himalayas to southwestern and northeastern China . Northern populations of the Eurasian crag martin are migratory , with European birds wintering in north Africa , Senegal , Ethiopia and the Nile Valley , and Asian breeders going to southern China , the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East . Some European birds stay north of the Mediterranean , and , like populations in warmer areas such as India , Turkey and Cyprus , just move to lower ground after breeding . The dusky crag martin and rock are largely resident apart from local movements after breeding , when many birds descend to lower altitudes , although some pale northern rock martins from North African and southern Arabian may winter further south alongside the local subspecies in Ethiopia , Mali and Mauritania . 
 The crag martins mainly breed on dry , warm and sheltered cliffs in mountainous areas with crags and gorges , and the Eurasian crag martin reaches 5 @,@ 000 m ( 16 @,@ 500 ft ) in Central Asia . The use of buildings as artificial cliffs has enabled breeding expansion into lowland areas , particularly for the two tropical species , and the rock martin breeds in desert towns . In South Asia , migrant Eurasian birds sometimes join with flocks of the dusky crag martin and roost communally on ledges of cliffs or buildings in winter . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Martin pairs often nest alone , although where suitable sites are available small loose colonies may form . These are more common south of the Sahara , where up to 40 rock martin pairs together have been recorded . Crag martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species . The nest , built by both adults over several weeks , is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry grass or sometimes feathers . It may be a half @-@ cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff , or shaped as a bowl like that of the barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge . The nest may be built on a rock cliff face , in a crevice or on a man @-@ made structure , and is re @-@ used for the second brood and in subsequent years . Usually two broods are raised , and the rock martin may nest for a third time in a season . 
 The clutch is two to five eggs that are white with brownish , ruddy or grey blotches particularly at the wide end . The egg size ranges from an average 20 @.@ 2 x 14 @.@ 0 mm ( 0 @.@ 80 x 0 @.@ 55 in ) with a weight of 2 @.@ 08 g ( 0 @.@ 073 oz ) for the Eurasian crag martin to 17 @.@ 7 x 13 @.@ 0 mm ( 0 @.@ 70 x 0 @.@ 51 in ) with a weight of 1 @.@ 57 g ( 0 @.@ 06 oz ) for the dusky crag martin . Both adults incubate the eggs for 13 – 19 days to hatching , and feed the chicks at least ten times an hour until they fledge 24 – 27 days later . The fledged young continue to be fed by the parents for some time after they can fly . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Ptyonoprogne martins feed mainly on insects caught in flight , although they will occasionally feed on the ground . When breeding , birds often fly back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills and usually feeding close to the nesting territory . To maintain the high frequency with which the young are fed , the adults mainly forage in the best hunting zones in the immediate vicinity of the nest , since the further they have to fly to catch insects , the longer it would take to bring food to the chicks in the nest . At other times , they may hunt low over open ground . The insects taken depend on what is locally available , but may include mosquitoes and other flies , aerial spiders , ants and beetles . Martins often feed alone , but sizeable groups may congregate if food is abundant , such as where insects are fleeing grass fires . The Eurasian crag martin may take aquatic species such as stoneflies , caddisflies and pond skaters . Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas . Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt , relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 The crag martins may be hunted by fast , agile birds of prey such as the African hobby or Eurasian hobby that specialise in catching swallows and martins in flight , and by other falcons such as the peregrine and Taita falcons . Crows may attack migrating Eurasian crag martins , and that species also treats common kestrels , Eurasian sparrowhawks , Eurasian jays and common ravens as predators if they approach the nesting cliffs . The dusky crag martin has been recorded in the diet of the greater false vampire bat , <unk> lyra . 
 Crag martins may host parasites , including blood @-@ sucking mites of the genus Dermanyssus such as D. <unk> , and the nasal mite Ptilonyssus <unk> . Invertebrate species first found in nests of crag martin species include the tick Argas ( A. ) africolumbae from a rock martin nest and the fly Ornithomya rupes and the flea Ceratophyllus <unk> from European crag martin nests . 
 = = Status = = 
 All four species have extensive ranges and large populations , and the increasing use of artificial nest sites has enabled range expansion . The rock martin often breeds in lowland and desert towns , the Eurasian crag martin 's range is expanding in Austria , Switzerland , the former Yugoslavia , Romania , and Bulgaria , and the dusky crag martin is spreading northeastwards into Guangxi , south into lowland Laos , and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh . There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia . Their large ranges and presumed high numbers mean that none of the crag martins are considered to be threatened , and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List . 
 = Mycena arcangeliana = 
 Mycena arcangeliana ( commonly known as the angel 's bonnet or the late @-@ season bonnet ) is a species of Mycenaceae fungus . It has been known by a number of scientific names , and its taxonomy is still somewhat disputed . It produces small mushrooms with caps varying in colour from whitish to a darker grey @-@ brown , and stems of an olive @-@ greyish that fade with age . The mushrooms can be mistaken for the similar Mycena flavescens . They have a mild taste , but a strong smell of <unk> ; they are not edible . The species grows on dead wood in autumn months , and can be found throughout Europe . 
 = = Taxonomy , naming , and classification = = 
 Mycena arcangeliana was first described by Giacomo Bresadola in 1904 ; the species was listed along with 41 others found in Pisa , in an article by Egidio <unk> published in the <unk> Della Societa Botanica Italiana ( Bulletin of the Botanical Society of Italy ) . Authors Roger Phillips and Paul <unk> both describe the name Mycena oortiana as synonymous ; M. oortiana was a name given by <unk> Hora in 1960 based on Robert Kühner 's 1938 name for the variety Mycena arcangeliana var. oortiana , an invalid name . Phillips had earlier considered M. arcangeliana var. oortiana to be a synonym of M. oortiana , and MycoBank lists it as a synonym of Lucien Quélet 's Mycena olivascens . However , Index Fungorum lists both M. olivascens and Kühner 's Mycena vitilis var. olivascens as synonyms of M. arcangeliana . The specific epithet arcangeliana may be in honour of Giovanni <unk> , who collected the species in the Orto botanico di Pisa . M. arcangeliana is commonly known as the angel 's bonnet , or the late @-@ season bonnet . 
 Within the genus Mycena , it is found in the section <unk> , on account of the cheilocystidia covered with evenly spaced , short cylindrical excrescences , and its size and occurrence on wood . It can be separated from the other members of the section on account of a cap with yellowish to olive shades , gills with pinkish hints and stems with vaguely violet colouration . 
 = = Description = = 
 Mycena arcangeliana mushrooms have caps of between 1 and 5 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 4 and 2 in ) in diameter which are conical in shape in younger mushrooms , becoming bell @-@ shaped with a broad umbo in older specimens . The oldest mushrooms have caps which are almost completely flat . The colouration varies from a whitish to a darker grey @-@ brown , sometimes with tints of olive or yellow , and it has furrows on the typically translucent surface . However , it is hygrophanous , and dries to a much paler colour . The cylindrical stem measures between 20 and 40 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 8 and 2 in ) in length , by 1 and 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 04 and 0 @.@ 08 in ) in width . In young mushrooms , it is an olive @-@ greyish colour , tinted with lilac , though it fades as the mushroom ages . The very top of the stem is a whitish colour , while the base is covered in white hairs . It is smooth and silky in texture , and there is no ring . The crowded gills are adnexed , that is , connected to the stem by only part of their depth , and are white in colour , turning pinkish as the mushroom ages . The gill edges are somewhat toothed . The flesh has a mild taste , but a strong smell of <unk> . In the cap , it is white , while in the stem , it is grey . The mushrooms are not edible . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 Mycena arcangeliana mushrooms leave a whitish spore print , while the spores are shaped like apple seeds and amyloid , meaning that they stain a dark colour in Melzer 's reagent or Lugol 's solution . The basidia are four @-@ spored . They measure from between 7 and 8 micrometres ( µm ) by 4 @.@ 5 and 5 µm . There are a large number of hyaline cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the edge of the gills ) which are club @-@ shaped or ovate . They have thin cell walls , and are covered in grain @-@ like warts . The pleurocystidia ( the cystidia on the face of the gill ) are similar in appearance . The pileipellis is made up of wart @-@ covered hyphae measuring between 2 and 4 @.@ 5 µm wide and up to 30 µm long . The outermost layer of the stem is made up hyphae with short , cylindrical hairs . The hyphae have clamp connections . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Mycena arcangeliana is somewhat similar to the less common Mycena flavescens , a species found in both hardwood and softwood forests on the floor among leaf or needle litter or grassland . M. flavescens typically has a whiter cap and a smell reminiscent of radish . M. <unk> , known from Algeria , has a similar cap colour to M. arcangeliana , but has a yellow stem . M. <unk> , known from the Netherlands , has a lemon @-@ yellow cap and stem and more gills . Another species similar in appearance is M. <unk> , which has a sweet taste . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Mycena arcangeliana grows on dead deciduous wood , favouring beech and ash , where it grows in " small troops " . It has also been recorded less frequently on conifers , bracken and Japanese knotweed . There have been reports from grassland , but these are probably a misidentification of M. flavescens . It is infrequently to commonly found in late summer to autumn months in the British Isles , though it is more commonly encountered in the south . Its distribution is fairly widespread elsewhere in Europe , though it is less common . It has been listed as vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Fungi in Norway . " Mycena oortiana " , which was rarely found in mycological literature , was described as a predominantly west @-@ European species ; however , M. arcangeliana has also been recorded in Scandinavia , Greenland , and Italy , from where it was first described . 
 = Ayudhapurusha = 
 Ayudhapurusha is the anthropomorphic depiction of a divine weapon in Hindu art . <unk> are sometimes considered as partial incarnates of their divine owners . 
 The sex of the personified weapon is determined by the gender of the weapon in the Sanskrit language . The suffix " purusha " ( man ) is added to masculine weapons and " devi " ( goddess ) to female ones . The weapons Shakti , <unk> ( a Hatchet @-@ like weapon ) and Gada ( mace ) , especially Kaumodaki ( the mace of Vishnu ) , <unk> / <unk> ( " bow " ) are women . Chakra , especially Vishnu 's Sudarshana Chakra ( discus of Vishnu ) , Shankha ( " conch " ) , Padma ( lotus ) , <unk> ( elephant goad ) , Pasha ( noose ) , Trisula ( trident ) , vajra ( thunderbolt ) , <unk> ( sword ) , Danda ( a sceptre or club ) , Bana / Shara ( " arrow " ) and <unk> ( sling ) are depicted male . 
 While weapons are personified in ancient Hindu epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata , the ayudhapurushas were depicted in sculpture starting from the Gupta era . They might be depicted as humans with the weapons against them or holding the weapon or with the weapon on their head or emerging from it . The most popular ayudhapurushas are associated with the god Vishnu and appear in his iconography . 
 = = Textual references = = 
 The first instance , where weapons are personified in Hindu scriptures , appears in the Hindu epic Ramayana . Two daughters of the Prajapati Daksha , Jaya and Vijaya are married to the sage <unk> . For destruction of Asuras ( " demons " ) , Jaya bore fifty sons - powerful divine weapons who could take any form . Suprabha gave birth to fifty invincible sons who were called <unk> ( " destroyers " ) . These magical weapons were known as Shastra @-@ devatas – the gods of weapons - and were given to king Kaushika , who later became the sage Vishwamitra . The weapons served him and later his pupil Rama , an avatar of Vishnu . The Mahabharata records at the time of the chakra @-@ musala war , the weapons of Krishna – another avatar of Vishnu and his brother Balarama appear in human form from the heavens to watch the battle . They include Krishna 's Sudarshana Chakra and Kaumodaki , and Balarama 's <unk> plough and <unk> musala ( club ) . The <unk> @-@ <unk> ( " envoy 's message " ) of the Sanskrit playwright Bhasa ( c . 2nd century BCE – 2nd century CE ) describes an episode from the Mahabharata when Krishna goes as an envoy to Kauravas ' court to broker peace between them and their cousins the Pandavas , on behalf of the latter . However , when the Kauravas try to arrest Krishna , Krishna assumes his Vishvarupa ( all pervading " Universal form " ) and summons his weapons , who appear as humans . The ayudhapurushas include the Sudarshana Chakra , the bow <unk> , Kaumodaki , <unk> the conch and <unk> the sword , elaborate descriptions of whom are found in the text . This is the only Sanskrit play that depicts the weapons on stage as humans . The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa mentions about dwarf @-@ like ayudhapurushas denoting Vishnu 's chakra , lotus , sword , bow and mace . 
 = = Textual descriptions = = 
 Treatises such as the Vishnudharmottara Purana and various Agamas describe the iconography of the ayudhapurushas . Shakti is depicted as a red @-@ hued woman seated on a wolf . The Danda is a fearful black @-@ complexioned man with wrathful red eyes . The <unk> is also a dark and angry man . Pasha is depicted as a male snake with seven hoods . <unk> ( " banner " ) is a yellow @-@ coloured strong man with his mouth wide open . The Trishula is a handsome black @-@ complexioned man with lovely eyebrows . The Shankha is described as a white male with adorable eyes . The Bana ( arrow ) is a red @-@ coloured man with beautiful eyes , however the <unk> describes it to be a black @-@ complexioned eunuch with three eyes , dressed in white clothes and riding on the wind . The <unk> ( bow ) is a red lotus coloured female with a stringed bow on her head . The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes Chakra as man with a fat belly and round eyes , decorated with various ornaments and holding a chamara ( chowry ) and with Vishnu 's left hand on his head . The slim @-@ waisted woman Gada holds a chowry in her hands and is adored with ornaments , with Vishnu 's right hand resting on her head . 
 While the Sudarshana Chakra is depicted as a subordinate figure with Vishnu , in many South Indian Vishnu temples , the Chakra as an ayudhapurusha is worshipped in its own shrine attached to the central temple . Here , the Chakra is regarded as an aspect of Vishnu and called Chakra @-@ <unk> Vishnu – Vishnu in the form of the Chakra . In the outline of the ordinary circular Chakra with a hexagram inscribed in it ( <unk> @-@ kona @-@ chakra ) – stands the personified Chakra in fierce form generally with eight arms . Often , Yoga @-@ Narasimha , the lion @-@ man ferocious aspect of Vishnu is depicted on the back of the Chakra sculpture . The Shilparatna describes that the fierce Chakra @-@ <unk> Vishnu should hold in his hands gada , chakra , a snake , a lotus , musala ( a pestle ) , <unk> , pasha and ankusha . He is depicted as radiant as the sun and with protruding tusks from the sides of his mouth . Another description describes the Chakra as a sixteen @-@ armed fierce form of Vishnu . He holds a chakra , shankha , bow , parashu , <unk> ( sword ) , arrow , trishula , pasha , ankusha , agni ( fire ) , khadga ( sword ) , shield , hala ( plough ) , musala , gada and kunta . Three @-@ eyed and golden @-@ coloured with protruding tusks , the Chakra stands in the <unk> @-@ kona @-@ chakra , with Narasimha on the reverse of the sculpture . 
 = = Sculptural depictions = = 
 An ayudhapurusha is generally depicted as a two @-@ armed figure , prescribed to shown with a <unk> mukuta ( conical crown ) . An ayudhapurusha may be depicted as a dwarf , concurring with Kalidasa 's description in the Raghuvamsa . Such icons are present in <unk> , Mahabalipuram and Badami . They may be depicted as normal humans as in Udayagiri Caves and in the Sheshashayi Vishnu panel of the Gupta era ( 320 – 550 CE ) Deogarh temple . At Deogarh , the Sudarshana Chakra is depicted against the Chakra / wheel and the Kaumodaki holding a gada . In another instance , the ayudhapurushas are depicted without their weapons , though C. <unk> opines that there is enough evidence to identify them as ayudhapurushas . The human Chakrapurusha depicted against the Chakra is seen on the chakra @-@ <unk> coin of the Gupta ruler Chandragupta II where the Chakrapurusha – here denoting the wheel of sovereignty – is dedicated bestowing the three <unk> of sovereignty to the king . The Gupta era and medieval sculptures often depict the ayudhapurushas in normal human proportions . Chola and Chalukya sculptors continued the trend , mostly focussing on the Sudarshana Chakra in a fierce multiple @-@ armed human form . Sometimes , the ayudhapurusha is depicted emerging from the associated weapon . 
 In another variation , the <unk> stands besides the deity with folded hands ( in anjali mudra posture ) with the weapon depicted on the head as part of the crown or the weapon mark on the forehead . The Sudarshana Chakra with the Chakra on his head in Deogarh and Chola era bronzes of Chakra and Gada in similar fashion are some illustrations . 
 In the last variation of the ayudhapurusha iconography , he / she holds the associated weapon . Common examples are the Sudarshana Chakra , the Shankha @-@ purusha and Kaumodaki , mostly found in Uttar Pradesh and Bengal art . Sharanga with the bow in his hand and <unk> with the sword as in Deogarh are other examples . 
 In some cases , the weapon may be depicted as in both anthropomorphic and their true form . While the central icon of Vishnu may hold the weapons , the ayudhapurushas of the same weapon may stand at the feet of the central icon .

 Black Hebrew Israelites ( also called Black Hebrews , African Hebrew Israelites , and Hebrew Israelites ) are groups of African Americans who believe they are descendants of the ancient Israelites . Black Hebrews adhere in varying degrees to the religious beliefs and practices of both Christianity and Judaism . They are not recognized as Jews by the greater Jewish community . Many choose to identify as Hebrew Israelites or Black Hebrews rather than as Jews to indicate their claimed historic connections . 
 Many Black Hebrew groups were founded in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries , from Kansas to New York City , by both Americans and West Indian immigrants . In the mid @-@ 1980s , the number of Black Hebrews in the United States was between 25 @,@ 000 and 40 @,@ 000 . In the 1990s , the Alliance of Black Jews ( which is no longer operating ) estimated that there were 200 @,@ 000 African @-@ American Jews ; this estimate was based on a 1990 survey conducted by the Council of Jewish Federations . The exact number of Black Hebrews within that surveyed group remains unspecified . 
 = = Overview = = 
 While Black Christians traditionally have identified spiritually with the Children of Israel , they never claimed to be physical descendants of the Israelites . In the late 19th century among some African Americans , an identification with the ancient Hebrews developed into an identification as ancient Hebrews . One of the first groups of Black Hebrews , the Church of God and Saints of Christ , was founded in 1896 in Kansas , but it retained elements of a messianic connection to Jesus . During the following decades , many more Black Hebrew congregations were established , some without any connection to Christianity . 
 After World War I , for example , Wentworth Arthur Matthew , an immigrant from Saint Kitts , founded a Black Hebrew congregation in Harlem , claiming descent from the ancient Israelites . He called it the Commandment Keepers of the Living God . Similar groups selected elements of Judaism and adapted them within a structure similar to that of the Black church . He incorporated it in 1930 and moved the congregation to Brooklyn , where he later founded the Israelite Rabbinical Seminary , where Black Hebrew rabbis have been educated and ordained . 
 The beliefs and practices of Black Hebrew groups vary considerably . The differences are so great that historian James <unk> has suggested the classification of the organizations into three groups : Black Jews , who maintain a Christological perspective and adopt Jewish rituals ; Black Hebrews , who are more traditional in their practice of Judaism ; and Black Israelites , who are most nationalistic and furthest from traditional Judaism . 
 Black Hebrew organizations have certain common characteristics . Anthropologist James E. Landing , author of Black Judaism , distinguishes the Black Hebrew movement , which he refers to as Black Judaism , from normative Judaism practiced by people who are Black ( " black Judaism " ) . Significantly , it does not depend on documented lineage to Jewish ancestors nor to recognized Orthodox or Conservative conversions : 
 Black Judaism is ... a form of institutionalized ( congregational ) religious expression in which black persons identify themselves as Jews , Israelites , or Hebrews ... in a manner that seems unacceptable to the " whites " of the world 's Jewish community , primarily because Jews take issue with the various justifications set forth by Black Jews in establishing this identity . Thus " Black Judaism , " as defined here , stands distinctly apart from " black Judaism , " or that Judaic expression found among black persons that would be acceptable to the world 's Jewish community , such as conversion or birth to a recognized Jewish mother . " Black Judaism " has been a social movement ; " black Judaism " has been an isolated social phenomenon . 
 Landing 's definition , and its underlying assumptions about race and normative Judaism , have been criticized . 
 = = Groups = = 
 During the late 19th and early 20th centuries , dozens of Black Hebrew organizations were established . In Harlem alone , at least eight such groups were founded between 1919 and 1931 . The Church of the Living God , the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations is the oldest @-@ known Black Hebrew group and the Church of God and Saints of Christ is one of the largest Black Hebrew organizations . The Commandment Keepers , founded by Wentworth Arthur Matthew in New York , are noted for their adherence to traditional Judaism . The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem are widely known for having moved from the United States , primarily Chicago , to Israel in the late @-@ 20th century .

 The oldest known Black Hebrew organization is the Church of the Living God , the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations . The group was founded by F. S. Cherry in Chattanooga , Tennessee , in 1886 , and later moved to Philadelphia . Theologically , the Church of the Living God mixed elements of Judaism and Christianity , counting the Bible — including the New Testament — and the Talmud as essential scriptures . The rituals of Cherry ’ s flock incorporated many Jewish practices and prohibitions alongside some Christian traditions . For example , during prayer the men wore skullcaps and congregants faced east . In addition , members of the Church were not permitted to eat pork . Prayers were accompanied by musical instruments and gospel singing . After Cherry 's death , members of the church believed he had left temporarily and would reappear soon in spirit to lead the church through his son . 
 = = = Church of God and Saints of Christ = = = 
 The Church of God and Saints of Christ was established in Lawrence , Kansas , in 1896 by African @-@ American William Saunders Crowdy . The group established its headquarters in Philadelphia in 1899 , and Crowdy later relocated to Washington , D.C. , in 1903 . After Crowdy 's death in 1908 , the church continued to grow under the leadership of William Henry Plummer , who moved the organization 's headquarters to its permanent location in Belleville , Virginia , in 1921 . In 1936 , the Church of God and Saints of Christ had more than 200 " tabernacles " ( congregations ) and 37 @,@ 000 members . Howard <unk> Plummer succeeded his father and became head of the organization in 1931 . His son , Levi Solomon Plummer , became the church 's leader in 1975 . Since 2001 , the Church of God and Saints of Christ has been led by Rabbi Jehu A. Crowdy , Jr . , a great @-@ grandson of William Saunders Crowdy . As of 2005 , it had fifty tabernacles in the United States and dozens in Africa . 
 The Church of God and Saints of Christ describes itself as " the oldest African @-@ American congregation in the United States that adheres to the tenets of Judaism " . Founded by American William Saunders Crowdy in Kansas in 1896 , it teaches that all Jews had been black originally , and that African Americans are descendants of the lost tribes of Israel . Members believe that Jesus was neither God nor the son of God , but rather an adherent to Judaism and a prophet . They also consider William Saunders Crowdy , their founder in Kansas , to be a prophet . 
 The Church of God and Saints of Christ synthesizes rituals from both Judaism and Christianity . They have adopted rites drawn from both the Old Testament and the New Testament . Its Old Testament observances include use of the Jewish calendar , celebration of Passover , circumcision of infant males , commemoration of the Sabbath on Saturday , and wearing of <unk> . Its New Testament rites include baptism ( immersion ) and <unk> , both of which have Old Testament origins . 
 = = = Commandment Keepers = = = 
 Wentworth Arthur Matthew founded the Commandment Keepers Congregation in Harlem in 1919 . Matthew was influenced by the non @-@ black Jews he met and by Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League . Garvey used the Biblical Jews in exile as a metaphor for black people in North America . One of the accomplishments of Garvey 's movement was to strengthen the connection between black Americans and Africa , Ethiopia in particular . When Matthew later learned about the Beta Israel — Ethiopian Jews — he identified with them . But , Israel recognizes the Beta Israel people as being descended from historic Jews by ancestry . 
 Today the Commandment Keepers follow traditional Jewish practice and observe Jewish holidays . Members observe kashrut , circumcise newborn boys and celebrate Bar and Bat <unk> , and their synagogue has a <unk> to separate men and women during worship . 
 The Commandment Keepers believe they are descendants of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba . Matthew taught that " the Black man is a Jew " and " all genuine Jews are Black men " , but he valued non @-@ black Jews as those who had preserved Judaism over the centuries . Matthew maintained cordial ties with non @-@ black Jewish leaders in New York and frequently invited them to worship at his synagogue . 
 Matthew established the Ethiopian Hebrew Rabbinical College ( later renamed the Israelite Rabbinical Academy ) in Brooklyn . He ordained more than 20 rabbis , who went on to lead congregations throughout the United States and the Caribbean . He remained the leader of the Commandment Keepers in Harlem , and in 1962 the congregation moved to a landmark building on 123rd Street . 
 Matthew died in 1973 , sparking an internal conflict over who would succeed him as head of the Harlem congregation . Shortly before his death Matthew named his grandson , David Matthew Doré , as the new spiritual leader . Doré was 16 years old at the time . In 1975 , the synagogue 's board elected Rabbi Willie White to be its leader . Rabbi Doré occasionally conducted services at the synagogue until the early 1980s , when White had Doré and some other members locked out of the building . Membership declined throughout the 1990s and by 2004 , only a few dozen people belonged to the synagogue . In 2007 the Commandment Keepers sold the building , while various factions among former members sued one another . 
 Beside the Harlem group , there are eight or ten Commandment Keeper congregations in the New York area , and others throughout North America and in Israel . Since 2000 , seven rabbis have graduated from the Israelite Rabbinical Academy founded by Matthew . 
 = = = African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem = = = 
 Ben Ammi Ben @-@ Israel established the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem in Chicago , Illinois , in 1966 , at a time of black nationalism and the African @-@ American Civil Rights Movement ( 1954 – 68 ) . In 1969 , after a sojourn in Liberia , Ben Ammi and about 30 Hebrew Israelites moved to Israel . Over the next 20 years , nearly 600 more members left the United States for Israel . As of 2006 , about 2 @,@ 500 Hebrew Israelites live in Dimona and two other towns in the Negev region of Israel , where they are widely referred to as Black Hebrews . In addition , there are Hebrew Israelite communities in several major American cities , including Chicago , St. Louis , and Washington , D.C. 
 The Black Hebrews believe they are descended from members of the Tribe of Judah who were exiled from the Land of Israel after the Romans destroyed the Second Temple in 70 CE . The group incorporates elements of African @-@ American culture into their interpretation of the Bible . They do not recognize rabbinical Jewish interpretations such as the Talmud . The Black Hebrews observe Shabbat and biblically ordained Jewish holidays such as Yom Kippur and Passover . Men wear <unk> on their African print shirts , women follow the <unk> ( biblical laws concerning menstruation ) , and newborn boys are circumcised . In accordance with their interpretation of the Bible , the Black Hebrews follow a strictly vegan diet and wear only natural fabrics . Most men have more than one wife , and birth control is not permitted . 
 When the first Black Hebrews arrived in Israel in 1969 , they claimed citizenship under the Law of Return , which gives eligible Jews immediate citizenship . But , the Israeli government ruled in 1973 that the group did not qualify for automatic citizenship because they could not prove Jewish descent and had not undergone Orthodox conversion . The Black Hebrews were denied work permits and state benefits . The group accused the Israeli government of racist discrimination . In 1981 , a group of American civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin investigated and concluded that racism was not the cause of the Black Hebrews ' situation . No official action was taken to return the Black Hebrews to the United States , but some individual members were deported for working illegally . 
 Some Black Hebrews renounced their American citizenship to try to prevent more deportations . In 1990 , Illinois legislators helped negotiate an agreement that resolved the Black Hebrews ' legal status in Israel . Members of the group are permitted to work and have access to housing and social services . The Black Hebrews reclaimed their American citizenship and have received aid from the U.S. government , which helped them build a school and additional housing . In 2003 the agreement was revised , and the Black Hebrews were granted permanent residency in Israel . 
 In 2009 , <unk> Ben @-@ Israel became the first Black Hebrew to gain Israeli citizenship . The Israeli government said that more Black Hebrews may be granted citizenship . 
 The Black Hebrews of Israel have become well @-@ known for their gospel choir , which tours throughout Israel and the United States . The group owns restaurants in several Israeli cities . In 2003 the Black Hebrews garnered much public attention when singer Whitney Houston visited them in Dimona . In 2006 , Eddie Butler , a Black Hebrew , was chosen by the Israeli public to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest . 
 = = Allegations of black supremacy and racism = = 
 In late 2008 , the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) described as black supremacist what it called " the extremist fringe of the Hebrew Israelite movement " . It wrote that the members of such groups " believe that Jews are devilish impostors and ... openly condemn whites as evil personified , deserving only death or slavery " . The SPLC also said that " most Hebrew Israelites are neither explicitly racist nor anti @-@ Semitic and do not advocate violence " . 
 The Black Hebrew groups characterized as black supremacist by the SPLC include the Nation of Yahweh and the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ . Also , the Anti @-@ Defamation League has written that the " 12 Tribes of Israel " website , maintained by a Black Hebrew group , promotes black supremacy . 
 = Utah Beach = 
 Utah Beach was the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied invasion of German @-@ occupied France in the Normandy landings on June 6 , 1944 ( D @-@ Day ) , during World War II . The westernmost of the five landing beaches , Utah is on the Cotentin Peninsula , west of the mouths of the Douve and Vire rivers . Amphibious landings at Utah were undertaken by United States Army troops , with sea transport , mine sweeping , and a naval bombardment force provided by the United States Navy and Coast Guard as well as elements from the British , Canadian , Dutch and other Allied navies . 
 The objective at Utah was to secure a beachhead on the Cotentin Peninsula , the location of important port facilities at Cherbourg . The amphibious assault , primarily by the US 4th Infantry Division and 70th Tank Battalion , was supported by airborne landings of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Division . The intention was to rapidly seal off the Cotentin Peninsula , prevent the Germans from reinforcing Cherbourg , and capture the port as quickly as possible . Utah , along with Sword Beach on the eastern flank , was added to the invasion plan in December 1943 . These changes doubled the frontage of the invasion and necessitated a month @-@ long delay so that additional landing craft and personnel could be assembled in England . Allied forces attacking Utah Beach faced two battalions of the 919th Grenadier Regiment , part of the 709th Static Infantry Division . While improvements to fortifications had been undertaken under the leadership of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel beginning in October 1943 , the troops assigned to defend the area were mostly poorly equipped non @-@ German conscripts . 
 D @-@ Day at Utah began at 01 : 30 , when the first of the airborne units arrived , tasked with securing the key crossroads at Sainte @-@ Mère @-@ Église and controlling the causeways through the flooded farmland behind Utah Beach so the infantry could advance inland . While some airborne objectives were quickly met , many paratroopers landed far from their drop zones and were unable to fulfill their objectives on the first day . On the beach itself , infantry and tanks landed in four waves beginning at 06 : 30 and quickly secured the immediate area with minimal casualties . Meanwhile , engineers set to work clearing the area of obstacles and mines , and additional waves of reinforcements continued to arrive . At the close of D @-@ Day , Allied forces had only captured about half of the planned area and contingents of German defenders remained , but the beachhead was secure . 
 The 4th Infantry Division landed 21 @,@ 000 troops on Utah at the cost of only 197 casualties . Airborne troops arriving by parachute and glider numbered an additional 14 @,@ 000 men , with 2 @,@ 500 casualties . Around 750 men were lost in engineering units , 70th Tank Battalion , and seaborne vessels sunk by the enemy . German losses are unknown . Cherbourg was captured on June 26 , but by this time the Germans had destroyed the port facilities , which were not brought back into full operation until September . 
 = = Allied planning = = 
 The decision to undertake a cross @-@ channel invasion of continental Europe within the next year was taken at the Trident Conference , held in Washington in May 1943 . The Allies initially planned to launch the invasion on May 1 , 1944 , and a draft of the plan was accepted at the Quebec Conference in August 1943 . General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) . General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group , which comprised all of the land forces involved in the invasion . 
 On December 31 , 1943 , Eisenhower and Montgomery first saw the plan , which proposed amphibious landings by three divisions and two @-@ thirds of an airborne division . The two generals immediately insisted that the scale of the initial invasion be expanded to five divisions , with airborne descents by three divisions , to allow operations on a wider front . The change doubled the frontage of the invasion from 25 miles ( 40 km ) to 50 miles ( 80 km ) . This would allow for quicker offloading of men and materiel , make it more difficult for the Germans to respond , and speed up the capture of the port at Cherbourg . Eisenhower and Lieutenant General Omar Bradley selected for Utah the VII Corps . Major General J. Lawton Collins , who had experience with amphibious operations in the Pacific Theater of Operations ( though not in the initial assaults ) , replaced Major General Roscoe Woodruff as commander of VII Corps . 
 Utah Beach , the westernmost of the five landing beaches , is on the Cotentin Peninsula , west of the mouths of the Douve and Vire rivers . The terrain between Utah and the neighboring Omaha Beach was swampy and difficult to cross , which meant that the troops landing at Utah would be isolated . The Germans had flooded the farmland behind Utah , restricting travel off the beach to a few narrow causeways . To help secure the terrain inland of the landing zone , rapidly seal off the Cotentin Peninsula , and prevent the Germans from reinforcing the port at Cherbourg , two airborne divisions were assigned to airdrop into German territory in the early hours of the invasion . 
 The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft and troop carrier aircraft for the expanded operation meant that the invasion had to be delayed to June . Production of landing craft was ramped up in late 1943 and continued into early 1944 , and existing craft were relocated from other theaters . More than 600 Douglas C @-@ 47 Skytrain transport aircraft and their crews took a circuitous route to England in early 1944 from Baer Field , Indiana , bringing the number of available troop carrier planes to over a thousand . 
 = = = Plan of attack = = = 
 Amphibious landings at Utah were to be preceded by airborne landings further inland on the Cotentin Peninsula commencing shortly after midnight . Forty minutes of naval bombardment was to begin at 05 : 50 , followed by air bombardment , scheduled for 06 : 09 to 06 : 27 . 
 The amphibious landing was planned in four waves , beginning at 06 : 30 . The first consisted of 20 Landing Craft , Vehicle , Personnel ( LCVPs ) carrying four companies from the 8th Infantry Regiment . The ten craft on the right were to land on Tare Green beach , opposite the strongpoint at Les Dunes de Varreville . The ten craft on the left were intended for Uncle Red beach , 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) south . Eight Landing Craft Tanks ( LCTs ) , each carrying four amphibious DD tanks of 70th Tank Battalion , were scheduled to land a few minutes before the infantry . 
 The second wave , scheduled for 06 : 35 , consisted of 32 LCVPs carrying four more companies of 8th Infantry , as well as combat engineers and naval demolition teams that were to clear the beach of obstacles . The third wave , scheduled for 06 : 45 , consisted of eight LCTs bringing more DD tanks plus armored bulldozers to assist in clearing paths off the beach . It was to be followed at 06 : 37 by the fourth wave , which had eight Landing Craft Mechanized ( LCM ) and three LCVPs with detachments of the 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions , assigned to clear the beach between the high and low water marks . 
 Troops involved in Operation Overlord , including members of the 4th Division scheduled to land at Utah Beach , left their barracks in the second half of May and proceeded to their coastal marshalling points . To preserve secrecy , the invasion troops were as much as possible kept out of contact with the outside world . The men began to embark onto their transports on June 1 , and the 865 ships of Force U ( the naval group assigned to Utah ) began their journey from Plymouth on June 3 and 4 . A 24 @-@ hour postponement of the invasion necessitated by bad weather meant that one convoy , U @-@ 2A , had to be recalled and hastily refuelled at Portland . The ships met at a rendezvous point ( nicknamed " Piccadilly Circus " ) southeast of the Isle of Wight to assemble into convoys to cross the Channel . Minesweepers began clearing lanes on the evening of June 5 .

 Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt , overall commander on the Western Front , reported to Hitler in October 1943 regarding the weak defences in France . This led to the appointment of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel to oversee the construction of enhanced fortifications along the Atlantic Wall , with special emphasis on the most likely invasion front , which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg . Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion , so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore . In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast , he ordered wooden stakes , metal tripods , mines , and large anti @-@ tank obstacles to be placed on the beach to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks . Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach , he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high @-@ tide mark . The terrain at Utah is flat , offering no high ground on which to place fortifications . The shallow beach varies in depth from almost nothing to 800 yards ( 730 m ) , depending on the tides . The Germans flooded the flat land behind the beach by damming up streams and opening the floodgates at the mouth of the Douve to admit seawater . 
 Defense of this sector of eastern coast of the Cotentin Peninsula was assigned to Generalleutnant Karl @-@ Wilhelm von <unk> and his 709th Static Infantry Division . The unit was not well equipped , lacking motorized transport and provided with captured French , Soviet , and Czech equipment . Many of the men were Ostlegionen ( non @-@ German conscripts recruited from Soviet prisoners of war , Georgians , and Poles ) , known to be deeply unreliable . The southernmost 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) of the sector was manned by about 700 troops stationed in nine strongpoints spaced from 1 @,@ 100 to 4 @,@ 400 yd ( 1 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 000 m ) apart . Tangles of barbed wire , booby traps , and the removal of ground cover made both the beach and the terrain around the strongpoints hazardous for infantry . The German 91st Infantry Division and 6th Fallschirmjäger Regiment , who arrived in May , were stationed inland as reserves . Detecting this move , the Allies shifted their intended airborne drop zones to the southeast .

 Bombing of Normandy began around midnight with over 2 @,@ 200 British and American bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland . Some 1 @,@ 200 aircraft departed England just before midnight to transport the airborne divisions to their drop zones behind enemy lines . Paratroops from 101st Airborne were dropped beginning around 01 : 30 , tasked with controlling the causeways behind Utah Beach and destroying road and rail bridges over the Douve . Gathering together into fighting units was made difficult by a shortage of radios and by the bocage terrain , with its hedgerows , stone walls , and marshes . Troops of the 82nd Airborne began arriving around 02 : 30 , with the primary objective of destroying two additional bridges over the Douve and capturing intact two bridges over the Merderet . They quickly captured the important crossroads at Sainte @-@ Mère @-@ Église ( the first town liberated in the invasion ) and began working to protect the western flank . Generalleutnant Wilhelm <unk> , commander of 91st Infantry Division , was trying to return to his headquarters near <unk> from war games at Rennes when he was killed by a paratrooper patrol . Two hours before the main invasion force landed , a raiding party of 132 members of 4th Cavalry Regiment swam ashore at 04 : 30 at Îles Saint @-@ Marcouf , thought to be a German observation post . It was unoccupied , but two men were killed and seventeen wounded by mines and German artillery fire . 
 Once the four troop transports assigned to Force U reached their assigned position 12 miles ( 19 km ) off the coast , 5 @,@ 000 soldiers of 4th Division and other units assigned to Utah boarded their landing craft in rough seas for the three @-@ hour journey to their designated landing point . The eighteen ships assigned to bombard Utah included the US Navy battleship Nevada , the Royal Navy monitor Erebus , and the heavy cruisers Hawkins ( Royal Navy ) and Tuscaloosa ( US Navy ) . Naval bombardment of areas behind the beach commenced at 05 : 45 , while it was still dark , with the gunners switching to pre @-@ assigned targets on the beach as soon as it was light enough to see , at 05 : 50 . USS Corry , a destroyer in the bombardment group , sunk after it struck a mine while evading fire from the Marcouf battery under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Walter Ohmsen . Since troops were scheduled to land at Utah and Omaha starting at 06 : 30 ( an hour earlier than the British beaches ) , these areas received only about 40 minutes of naval bombardment before the assault troops began to land on the shore . Coastal air bombardment was undertaken in the twenty minutes immediately prior to the landing by around 300 Martin B @-@ 26 Marauders of the IX Bomber Command . Due to cloud cover , the pilots decided to drop to low altitudes of 4 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 to 1 @,@ 800 m ) . Much of the bombing was highly effective , with the loss of only two aircraft . 
 = = = Landing on beach = = = 
 The first troops to reach the shore were four companies from the 2nd Battalion , 8th Infantry , arriving at 06 : 30 on 20 LCVPs . Companies B and C landed on the segment code @-@ named Tare Green , and Companies E and F to their left on Uncle Red . Leonard T. Schroeder , leading Company F , was the first man to reach the beach . The landing craft were pushed to the south by strong currents , and they found themselves near Exit 2 at Grande Dune , about 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @.@ 8 km ) from their intended landing zones opposite Exit 3 at Les Dunes de Varreville . The first senior officer ashore , Supernumerary General Officer Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt , Jr. of the 4th Infantry Division , personally scouted the nearby terrain . He determined that this landing site was actually better , as there was only one strongpoint in the immediate vicinity rather than two , and it had been badly damaged by bombers of IX Bomber Command . In addition , the strong currents had washed ashore many of the underwater obstacles . Deciding to " start the war from right here " , he ordered further landings to be re @-@ routed . 
 The second wave of assault troops arrived at 06 : 35 on 32 LCVPs . Companies A and D of 1st Battalion , 8th Infantry landed on Tare Green and G and H on Uncle Red . They were accompanied by engineers and demolition teams tasked with removing beach obstacles and clearing the area directly behind the beach of obstacles and mines . 
 A contingent of the 70th Tank Battalion , comprising 32 amphibious DD tanks on eight LCTs , were supposed to arrive about 10 minutes before the infantry . However , a strong headwind caused them to be about 20 minutes late , even though they launched the tanks 1 @,@ 500 yards ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) from shore rather than 5 @,@ 000 yards ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) as planned . Four tanks of Company A and their personnel were lost when their LCT hit a mine about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) south of Iles St. Marcouf and was destroyed , but the remaining 28 arrived intact . 
 The third wave , arriving at 06 : 45 , included 16 conventional M4 Sherman tanks and 8 dozer tanks of the 70th Tank Battalion . They were followed at 06 : 37 by the fourth wave , which had eight LCMs and three LCVPs with detachments of the 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions , assigned to clear the beach between the high and low water marks . 
 Company B came under small arms fire from defenders positioned in houses along the road as they headed to the enemy strongpoint <unk> near La Madeleine , northwest of La Grande Dune and 600 yards ( 550 m ) inland . They met little resistance at <unk> , the headquarters of 3rd Battalion , 919th Grenadiers . Company C disabled the enemy strongpoint <unk> at La Grande Dune , which had been heavily damaged in the preliminary bombardment . Companies E and F ( about 600 men ) proceeded inland about 700 yards ( 640 m ) to strongpoint <unk> at La Dune , which they captured after a short skirmish . They next travelled south on a farm road parallel to the beach towards Causeway 1 . Companies G and H moved south along the beach toward enemy strongpoint <unk> at Beau Guillot . They encountered a minefield and came under enemy machine gun fire , but soon captured the position . 70th Tank Battalion was expecting to have to help neutralize beach fortifications in the immediate area , but since this job was quickly completed by the infantry , they had little to do initially . The landing area was almost totally secure by 08 : 30 , at which point combat teams prepared to push further inland along the causeways . Meanwhile , additional waves of reinforcements continued to arrive on the beach . 
 Removal of mines and obstacles from the beach , a job that had to be performed quickly before the tide came in at 10 : 30 , was the assignment of 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions and the eight dozer tanks . The teams used explosives to destroy beach obstacles and blow gaps in the sea wall to allow quicker access for troops and vehicles . The dozer tanks pushed the wreckage out of the way to create clear lanes for further landings . 
 = = = Moving inland = = = 
 The next move for the 4th Division was to begin movement down the three causeways through the flooded farmland behind the beach to link up with the 101st Airborne , who had dropped behind enemy lines before dawn . 2nd Battalion and several tanks headed down Causeway 1 towards <unk> , which they discovered had already been captured by the 3 / 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment . A dozen German infantrymen , trapped between the two Allied forces , surrendered . Causeway 2 , directly behind La Grande Dune , eventually became the main exit road off the beach . Securing this causeway required the capture of Ste . Marie du Mont , about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) inland . The Germans had blown a small bridge over a culvert , and movement was delayed while engineers made a repair and cleared two inoperable tanks from the road . Causeway 2 quickly became congested , so some units opted to walk through the flooded areas beside the road . Several hundred defenders were positioned in and around Ste . Marie du Mont , including 6th Fallschirmjäger Regiment of the 91st Infantry Division . Members of the 506th Parachute Infantry successfully attacked batteries at <unk> and <unk> Manor and took Ste . Marie du Mont in house @-@ to @-@ house and street combat , clearing the way for 8th Infantry , 3rd Battalion to advance up Causeway 2 practically unopposed . 8th Infantry , 1st Battalion headed up Causeway 3 towards <unk> @-@ la @-@ Hubert , which had already been captured by the 502nd Parachute Infantry . As at <unk> , enemy soldiers ( in this case several dozen ) were caught between the two converging forces and had to surrender . 
 Meanwhile , 22nd Infantry , 3rd Battalion and five tanks moved north along the beach , tasked with eliminating as many German strongpoints as possible . They discovered that tank fire could only destroy the concrete pillboxes via a direct hit on the embrasures , so they called for artillery fire from the naval vessels offshore . By evening they had combined with 12th Infantry , who had travelled directly across the flooded fields to a position far short of their target for the day , to form a defensive perimeter on the northern end of the beachhead . On the southern end of the beachhead , about 3 @,@ 000 men of the 6th Fallschirmjäger Regiment moved into position near Saint @-@ Côme @-@ du @-@ Mont , preventing the 501st Parachute Infantry from advancing any further on D @-@ Day . 
 In the center , the 82nd Airborne were able to consolidate their position at Sainte @-@ Mère @-@ Église in part due to the work of First Lieutenant Turner Turnbull and a squad of 43 men , who held off for more than two hours a far larger enemy force that was attempting to retake the crossroads from the north . A task force led by Colonel Edson Raff that included 16 Sherman tanks of the 746th Tank Battalion , four armored cars , and a squad of infantry worked their way up from the beach , but were stopped from reinforcing Sainte @-@ Mère @-@ Église by a line of German defenders 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) south of the town . Reinforcements arrived by glider around 04 : 00 ( Mission Chicago and Mission Detroit ) , and 21 : 00 ( Mission Keokuk and Mission Elmira ) , bringing additional troops and heavy equipment . Like the paratroopers , many landed far from their drop zones . Even those that landed on target experienced difficulty , with heavy cargo such as Jeeps shifting during landing , crashing through the wooden fuselage , and in some cases crushing personnel on board . German defenders also took a toll on the glider units , with heavy losses inflicted in the area near Sainte @-@ Mère @-@ Église in particular . Members of the 82nd Airborne who had landed west of the Merderet were widely scattered and surrounded by enemy forces . They quickly realized that they would be unable to achieve their D @-@ day objectives and would have to wait for reinforcements . It took several days for this to happen as the Germans set up defensive positions along the river . For 36 hours , 82nd Airborne were unable to establish radio contact with other units or with Collins aboard his command ship , USS Bayfield . 
 82nd Airborne were finally relieved by 90th Division , who began disembarking at 16 : 00 on D @-@ Day and were all ashore by June 8 . The original plan for the 90th had been that they should push north toward the port of Cherbourg , but Collins changed their assignment : they were to cut across the Cotentin Peninsula , isolating the German forces therein and preventing reinforcements from entering the area . Their poor performance led to their being replaced by the more experienced 82nd Airborne and 9th Infantry Division , who reached the west coast of the Cotentin on June 17 , cutting off Cherbourg . The 9th Division , joined by the 4th and 79th Infantry Divisions , took control of the peninsula in fierce fighting . Cherbourg fell during the Battle of Cherbourg on June 26 , but by this time the Germans had destroyed the port facilities , which were not brought back into full operation until September .

 The 4th Infantry Division did not meet all their D @-@ Day objectives at Utah Beach , partly because they had arrived too far to the south , but they landed 21 @,@ 000 troops at the cost of only 197 casualties . Airborne troops arriving by parachute and glider numbered an additional 14 @,@ 000 men , with 2 @,@ 500 casualties . Around 750 men were lost in engineering units , 70th Tank Battalion , and LCTs and other vessels sunk by the enemy . German losses are unknown . 
 Forces landing on Utah Beach cleared the immediate area in less than an hour , and penetrated 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) inland by the close of D @-@ Day . Within two hours of landing , the 82nd Airborne captured the important crossroads at Sainte @-@ Mère @-@ Église , but they failed to neutralize the line of defenses along the Merderet on D @-@ Day as planned . While many of the airborne forces landed far from their drop zones and were unable to meet all their D @-@ Day objectives , this widespread scattering of forces had the unintended side effect of confusing the German defenders , who were slow to react . 
 The highly trained 4th Division faced a mediocre German unit composed of conscripts ; all the best troops had been sent to the Eastern Front . The Allies achieved and maintained air superiority , which meant that the Germans were unable to make observations of preparations underway in Britain prior to the invasion and were unable to launch airborne <unk> on D @-@ Day . Extensive Allied reconnaissance provided the attackers with detailed maps of the defenses and terrain . Unlike neighboring Omaha Beach , the preliminary aerial bombardment was highly effective at Utah . <unk> and an overcomplicated command structure on the part of the German high command was also a factor in the Allied success at Utah and throughout the Normandy campaign .

 Ekaterina II had two 3 @-@ cylinder vertical compound steam engines built by the Baltic Works . Fourteen cylindrical boilers , also built by the Baltic Works , provided steam to the engines . The engines had a total designed output of 9 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 700 kW ) , but they produced 9 @,@ 101 ihp ( 6 @,@ 787 kW ) on trials and gave a top speed of 15 @.@ 25 knots ( 28 @.@ 24 km / h ; 17 @.@ 55 mph ) .

 Ekaterina II was named after the Empress Catherine II of Russia . She was the only one of her class to be built by the Nikolayev Admiralty Dockyard at Nikolaev . The ship was laid down on 26 June 1883 , launched on 20 May 1886 , and completed in 1889 . She ran her first trials in 1888 , after she had been transferred to Sevastopol to be fitted out , and spent her career with the Black Sea Fleet . In 1897 the Naval General Staff proposed to re @-@ gun her with more powerful 12 @-@ inch 40 @-@ calibre guns and to replace the compound armour of her redoubt with Krupp armor , but this proved to be too expensive . Her machinery was upgraded between mid @-@ 1898 and 1902 . Her boilers were replaced with eighteen Belleville water @-@ tube boilers and her engines were converted to triple expansion . On trials after the refit she made 9 @,@ 978 ihp ( 7 @,@ 441 kW ) and a speed of 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) on 8 November 1902 . 
 Her crew was considered sympathetic to the revolutionary movement when the crew of the battleship Potemkin mutinied in June 1905 and her engines were disabled to prevent her from joining Potemkin . She was turned over to the Sevastopol port authorities before being stricken on 14 August 1907 .

 " That was a conscious move by Max and myself , because we were listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song – I don 't remember what it was .

' It was driving him nuts , because that indie song was sort of on six , going to seven , going to eight , the chorus comes . . . and it goes back down to five . It drove him crazy . And when he said that , it was like , light bulb . ' Why don 't we do that , but put a big chorus on it ? ' It worked . " 
 " Since U Been Gone " was the last track that Clarkson recorded for Breakaway ; it was recorded in Sweden .

 = USS Georgia ( BB @-@ 15 ) = 
 USS Georgia ( BB @-@ 15 ) was a United States Navy Virginia @-@ class battleship , the third of five ships of the class . She was built by the Bath Iron Works in Maine , with her keel laid in August 1901 and her launching in October 1904 . The completed battleship was commissioned into the fleet in September 1906 . The ship was armed with an offensive battery of four 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) guns and eight 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) guns , and she was capable of a top speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . 
 Georgia spent the majority of her career in the Atlantic Fleet . In 1907 , she took part in the Jamestown Exposition and suffered an explosion in her aft 8 @-@ inch gun turret that killed or wounded 21 men . At the end of the year , she joined the Great White Fleet on its circumnavigation of the globe , which ended in early 1909 . Peacetime training followed for the next five years , and in 1914 she cruised in Mexican waters to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution . In early 1916 , the ship was temporarily decommissioned . 
 When the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , the ship was tasked with training naval recruits for the expanding wartime fleet . Starting in September 1918 , she was used as a convoy escort . Her only casualties during the war were due to disease , the result of poor conditions and severe overcrowding aboard the ship . Georgia was used to transport American soldiers back from France in 1918 – 19 , and the following year she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet , where she served as the flagship of the 2nd Division , 1st Squadron . The Washington Naval Treaty , signed in 1922 , cut short the ship 's career , as it mandated severe draw @-@ downs in naval strength . Georgia was accordingly sold for scrap in November 1923 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Georgia was 441 feet 3 inches ( 134 @.@ 49 m ) long overall and had a beam of 76 ft 3 in ( 23 @.@ 24 m ) and a draft of 23 ft 9 in ( 7 @.@ 24 m ) . She displaced 14 @,@ 948 long tons ( 15 @,@ 188 t ) as designed and up to 16 @,@ 094 long tons ( 16 @,@ 352 t ) at full load . The ship was powered by two @-@ shaft triple @-@ expansion steam engines rated at 19 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 14 @,@ 000 kW ) and twenty @-@ four coal @-@ fired Niclausse boilers , generating a top speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . As built , she was fitted with heavy military masts , but these were quickly replaced by cage masts in 1909 . She had a crew of 812 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of four 12 inch / 40 Mark 4 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline , one forward and aft . The secondary battery consisted of eight 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) / 45 guns and twelve 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) / 45 guns . The 8 @-@ inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets ; two of these were superposed atop the main battery turrets , with the other two turrets abreast the forward funnel . The 6 @-@ inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull . For close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats , she carried twelve 3 @-@ inch / 50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3 @-@ pounder guns . As was standard for capital ships of the period , Georgia carried four 21 in ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes , submerged in her hull on the broadside . 
 Georgia 's main armored belt was 11 in ( 279 mm ) thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and 6 in ( 152 mm ) elsewhere . The main battery gun turrets ( and the secondary turrets on top of them ) had 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) thick faces , and the supporting barbettes had the 10 in ( 250 mm ) of armor plating . The conning tower had 9 in ( 230 mm ) thick sides .

 Georgia was laid down on 31 August 1901 at the Bath Iron Works in Maine . Her completed hull was launched on 11 October 1904 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 24 September 1906 . Georgia conducted a shakedown cruise after fitting @-@ out work was completed , before joining the 2nd Division , 1 Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet . She steamed out of Hampton Roads on 26 March 1907 to join the rest of the fleet in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba ; there , the ships conducted gunnery training . Georgia then steamed to the Boston Navy Yard for repairs before attending the Jamestown Exposition , which commemorated the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown colony . An international fleet that included British , French , German , Japanese , and Austro @-@ Hungarian warships joined the US Navy at the event . On 10 June , the ship took part in a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt . Two days later , she departed for target practice in Cape Cod Bay , arriving on 15 June . A propellant charge exploded in her aft 8 @-@ inch turret on 15 July , killing ten officers and men and wounding another eleven . Later that year , the ship took part in fleet maneuvers in the Atlantic , and on 24 September she went into dry dock at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for an overhaul . 
 Georgia joined the Great White Fleet on 16 December 1907 , when they departed Hampton Roads to begin their circumnavigation of the globe . The purpose of the cruise was a show of naval strength . The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America , making stops in Port of Spain , Rio de Janeiro , Punta Arenas , and Valparaíso , among other cities . After arriving in Mexico in March 1908 , the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice . The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas , stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia , stopping in Hawaii on the way . Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne , Sydney , and Auckland . 
 After leaving Australia , the fleet turned north for the Philippines , stopping in Manila , before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama . Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November . The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean ; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said , Egypt . The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar , where an international fleet of British , Russian , French , and Dutch warships greeted the Americans . The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 , having traveled 46 @,@ 729 nautical miles ( 86 @,@ 542 km ; 53 @,@ 775 mi ) . There , they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt . 
 Over the course of the following year and a half , Georgia conducted a peacetime routine of training maneuvers and gunnery drills . On 2 November 1910 , she took part in a naval review for President William Howard Taft in preparation for a cruise to western Europe with the Atlantic Fleet . The ships stopped in France and Britain , and conducted extensive maneuvers while on the cruise . Georgia and the rest of the fleet arrived back in Guantanamo Bay on 13 March 1911 . She returned to her peacetime training routine for the next two years . On 5 June 1913 , she conducted a training cruise for midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy , followed by an overhaul in the Boston Navy Yard . In early January , she was deployed to Mexican waters to protect American interests in the country during the Mexican Revolution . She remained there from 14 January 1914 to March , when she returned to Norfolk briefly . The ship was back cruising off Mexico during the summer , and from August to October she operated in Haitian waters to protect Americans in the country , which was also experiencing internal unrest . 
 The ship then went into drydock for an overhaul , before returning to Cuban waters for maneuvers with the fleet . She arrived there on 25 February 1915 . The rest of the year was spent with training exercises with the Atlantic Fleet . Another overhaul , at the Boston Navy Yard , from 20 January to January 1916 . On 27 January , Georgia was decommissioned temporarily . The same day as the United States ' declaration of war against Germany on 6 April 1917 , the ship was reactivated for service during World War I. She was assigned to the 3rd Division , Battleship Force , based in the York River , Virginia . She spent most of the war training gunners for the rapidly expanding wartime Navy and conducting tactical training exercises . During this period , the ship frequently had more than a thousand men aboard the ship , despite the fact that she had sleeping accommodations for only 750 . The ship 's commander at the time , Captain Sumner <unk> , raised concerns about the over @-@ crowded conditions aboard the ship . 
 From September 1918 to the end of the conflict , Georgia was assigned to the Cruiser Force Atlantic as a convoy escort . The ship 's first operation was with troop ship convoy 67 , which departed New York on 23 September ; the rest of the escort consisted of the armored cruisers North Carolina and Montana and the destroyer Rathburne . Georgia had to take on 525 long tons ( 533 t ) of coal in addition to her normal stocks , which significantly degraded her seakeeping characteristics . The ship accordingly had to be <unk> down to reduce flooding from heavy seas , which had the effect of hastening the spread of disease . During the cruise , the crew suffered from 120 cases of influenza and 14 cases of pneumonia ; 7 men died from disease . Even with the additional coal , the ship did not have sufficient fuel to reach the hand off point and she had to break off from the convoy to return to port . Germany signed an Armistice with the Allied powers , ending the war on 11 November . On 10 December , the ship was equipped to serve as a transport to carry American soldiers back from France . This duty saw the ship transferred to the Cruiser and Transport Force . She made five trips between December 1918 and June 1919 , carrying almost 6 @,@ 000 soldiers in total . The first trip , made in company with the battleship Kansas , arrived in Brest , France on 22 December 1918 . 
 Georgia was transferred to the Pacific Fleet shortly thereafter , departing from Boston on 16 July 1919 . She transited the Panama Canal and arrived in San Diego , where she became the flagship of the 2nd Division , 1st Squadron . The ship went to the Mare Island Navy Yard for periodic maintenance on 20 September . The ship remained there until 15 July 1920 when she was decommissioned . Under the terms of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty , the ship was sold for scrapping on 1 November 1923 and subsequently was broken up . The ship was formally stricken from the naval register on 10 November . 
 = Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall = 
 Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall ( Norwegian : Gjøvik Olympiske <unk> or <unk> ) is an ice hockey rink located within a mountain hall in Gjøvik , Norway . With a capacity for 5 @,@ 500 spectators , the hall also features a 25 @-@ meter swimming pool and telecommunications installations . Opened in 1993 and costing 134 @.@ 6 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) , it was built for the 1994 Winter Olympics , where it hosted 16 ice hockey matches . It is the home of Gjøvik Hockey , has hosted the 1995 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships and is also used as an event venue . The structure is the world 's largest cavern hall for public use . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Because half the country 's surface consists of exposed rock , Norway has a tradition of building mountain cavern halls for many purposes , from tunnels via power plants to sport centers . These often double up as bomb shelters . Gjøvik Municipality opened Norway 's first underground swimming pool in 1974 . The idea to build an underground ice rink came from Consulting Engineer Jan A. <unk> while having dinner with Municipal Engineer Helge <unk> in 1988 , after the latter said that Gjøvik had been awarded an ice rink for the Olympics . The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant . An alternative proposal for a conventional rink was also made . Among the advantage of a cavern hall was that it would not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town 's cityscape , yet it would be centrally located which would reduce travel costs , and there would be a stable year @-@ round natural temperature which would reduce cooling costs . 
 A budget was prepared by the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee ( LOOC ) in December 1989 , and in April 1990 , the Parliament of Norway passed a grant . In October , LOOC and Gjøvik Municipality made an agreement to share the ownership of the venue . The municipal council took the decision to build underground on 24 January 1991 and the main planning was contracted to <unk> . Main architects were Moe – <unk> . A research group was created , which had four main tasks : ventilation , energy , fire and safety ; the environment ; rock mechanism and geology ; and laws and regulations . The group also made marketing information to promote Norwegian underground technology internationally . In preparation for construction , drilling samples were taken and sent to SINTEF and the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute for testing . The rock is 800 to 1 @,@ 100 million year @-@ old gneiss which is well suited for creating caverns . Computer models were created , and estimates were based on the Q @-@ method . 
 Construction started on 1 April 1991 . Several points of attack were created to get the most rational work @-@ load . The first tunnel was created 10 meters ( 33 ft ) below the level of the roof of the cavern . First the roof was blasted , then work started downwards . The first eight months were used for excavation , and 140 @,@ 000 cubic meters ( 4 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of rock in 29 @,@ 000 truckloads were removed . 170 tonnes ( 170 long tons ; 190 short tons ) of dynamite were used during blasting . The mass was used to build a new marina , a lake @-@ side promenade and a parking facility . Throughout construction , surveillance was made continually of the rock , and the crown of the roof was measured to have settled 8 to 10 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 31 to 0 @.@ 39 in ) , which was as expected . Safety planning was done in cooperation with the National Office of Building Technology and Administration , and included the use of <unk> materials , creation of sufficient fire exits . 
 The hall cost NOK 134 @.@ 6 million , of which NOK 88 @.@ 5 million was grants from the government . The hall opened on 6 May 1993 , with a show televised on national television and with 5 @,@ 000 guests . It was the 29th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway , and the world 's largest cavern hall for public use . At the time of opening , the venue was estimated to incur an operating cost of NOK 3 to 4 four million , and an operating deficit of NOK 1 @.@ 7 million . To finance this , the state established a fund similar to other Olympic venues , but the fund only received NOK 1 million , and the rest of the operating costs would have to be taken by the municipality . The venue is owned through Gjøvik Olympiske Anlegg , originally owned 70 % by Gjøvik Municipality and 30 % by Lillehammer Olympiapark , but later taken entirely over by the municipality . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 The facility is located just west of the town center of Gjøvik , with the main hall 120 meters ( 390 ft ) into the mountain . It is covered by 25 to 55 meters ( 82 to 180 ft ) of bedrock . In addition to a main hall , there is a swimming pool , a cafeteria and a telecommunications facility operated by Telenor . The main hall is designed as a multi @-@ use venue , and can feature indoor football , handball , basketball , volleyball , rifling and tennis , as well as concerts , dining and events . 
 The gross area of the complex is 14 @,@ 910 square meters ( 160 @,@ 500 sq ft ) , while the net area is 10 @,@ 010 square meters ( 107 @,@ 700 sq ft ) . The stadium covers 1 @,@ 965 square meters ( 21 @,@ 150 sq ft ) , the public areas cover 2 @,@ 224 square meters ( 23 @,@ 940 sq ft ) , the media center covers 2 @,@ 110 square meters ( 22 @,@ 700 sq ft ) , the participant facilities cover 263 square meters ( 2 @,@ 830 sq ft ) , the administrative and VIP facilities cover 577 square meters ( 6 @,@ 210 sq ft ) , and the operations , management , technical , electrical and storage facilities cover 2 @,@ 253 square meters ( 24 @,@ 250 sq ft ) . The main hall cavern has is 61 meters ( 200 ft ) wide , 91 meters ( 299 ft ) long and 25 meters ( 82 ft ) high . Seating capacity for the ice rink is 5 @,@ 800 , although it was 5 @,@ 300 during the Olympics . The grandstands have a safety area under them ; in case of a fire , spectators can be evacuated to these areas where they would remain until evacuation is safe . The hall duplicates as a civil defense facility , and is designed to withstand nuclear , conventional and gas attacks . 
 The Olympic venues were designed to reflect Norwegian culture and character . The hall was designed to play on Scandinavian folklore , such as the Hall of the Mountain King in Henrik Ibsen 's Peer Gynt and the caves of fairy @-@ tale trolls . This has for instance been emulated through the use of <unk> on the walls to give a dark and mysterious impression . Lighting is used to create high contrast , such as from the entrance which is dark with pools of light , to the main hall which is brightly lit , to emphasize its size . The dark entrance is also used to adjust the spectators ' eyes so the main hall seems brighter . A contrast has also been used between the grandstands ' slender lines and the coarse finish of the cavern rock . Red was chosen as the hall 's main color because of natural occurrence of red in the rock . Glass tiles are used as they give associations to ice . Ventilation , energy and other installations use shine metal , representing silver embedded in the rock . The main hall is designed as an amphitheater with close contact between spectators and athletes . 
 = = Events = = 
 Since the opening , the venue has hosted Gjøvik Hockey , which started in 1993 in the Fourth Division . During the 1994 Winter Olympics , Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall hosted 16 ice hockey matches between 12 and 26 February , including two quarter @-@ finals and one semi @-@ final . The remaining matches were played at the larger Håkons Hall in Lillehammer . In March 1995 , the operator announced that the ice would remain throughout the year . Because of the natural cooling of the mountain , the operator saved 1 @,@ 000 kilowatts in heating costs by reusing the cooling system to heat the rest of the cavern hall . On 4 April 1995 , the venue was used to host an international match between Norway and Sweden . 
 Originally the 1995 World Short Track Speed Skating Championships was planned to take place at Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre in Hamar , the same venue which hosted short track speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics . However , because Storhamar was at scheduled time playing play @-@ offs in the Norwegian Ice Hockey Championship , it was in December 1994 decided to move the tournament to Gjøvik . The championship opened on Friday 17 March with the 1500 meter races , and was followed by the 500 meter races the following day . The remaining events were held on 19 March . It is the only time the world championship has been held in Norway . There were set six world records during the championship . Chae Ji @-@ Hoon 's time 4 : 56 @.@ 29 in the men 's 3000 meter and Chun Lee @-@ Kyung at 5 : 02 @.@ 18 in the women 's 3000 meter .

Both the relay teams also set world records : Canada with the men 's record at 7 : 09 @.@ 76 and the China with the women 's at 4 : 26 @.@ 68 . The hall was one of seven venues used during the group state of the 1999 World Women 's Handball Championship . Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics and Gjøvik is set to host short track speed skating . 
 = Gus Winckel = 
 Willem Frederick August ( Gus ) Winckel ( 3 November 1912 – 17 August 2013 ) was a Dutch military officer and pilot who flew for the Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force ( ML @-@ KNIL ) in World War II . During the attack on Broome , Western Australia , on 3 March 1942 , Winckel managed to land his plane full of refugees safely on the Broome airstrip just before the Japanese attack . He then dismounted the plane 's machine gun and shot down one of the Japanese fighters , the only Allied " kill " during the attack . 
 Shortly after the attack on Broome , Winckel was sent on a mission to Bandung , Java , to recover several officers from the Allied headquarters , which was under threat of being overrun . He served the remainder of the war with No. 18 ( Netherlands East Indies ) Squadron RAAF in Australia . After World War II , he fought in the Dutch Politionele acties . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Winckel was born on 3 November 1912 in <unk> , Bangka Island , in what was then the Dutch East Indies . On the island his parents ran a trading store in commodities such as rubber , tin and sugar . Winckel had an untroubled childhood and at age fifteen was sent back to the Netherlands to study at the nautical school in <unk> . He stayed with his grandparents while studying , and three years later became a seaman first class for the merchant marine . He specialised in navigation . In 1931 , when he was aged nineteen , Winckel started working as a quartermaster on the freighter <unk> , which sailed between the Netherlands and Java . After his work on the ship he went to the island of Borneo to work on oil rigs . By 1935 he returned to the Netherlands once more , this time to work for the Royal Netherlands Navy as a submarine torpedo <unk> . During his time at the Navy a friend showed him a flyer for a pilot position at the Netherlands East Indies Air Force , which was being formed at the time . Winckel joined the Air Force in 1935 and became a pilot at age 23 . Between 1935 and 1942 he flew transports across the Dutch East Indies , mainly in Lockheed Lodestars . 
 = = Attack on Broome and flight to Java = = 
 On 3 March 1942 , Flight Lieutenant Winckel was transporting refugees from the Bandung , Dutch East Indies , to Perth , Western Australia , in his Lockheed Lodestar . He had just stopped on the Broome Airfield to refuel when Broome was attacked by nine Japanese Zero fighter planes on a long @-@ distance raid from Kupang , Timor . Winckel saw the danger of his plane being on the open airstrip and proceeded to dismount the Colt <unk> machine gun from the plane . When one of the Zeros , piloted by Osamu Kudō , flew over at low altitude , Winckel managed to shoot him out of the air ; the crash killed Kudō . Winckel was thereby credited with the raid 's only " kill " on the Allied side . He also believed that he hit another Japanese plane that had to ditch in the sea . The Japanese destroyed 22 allied aircraft at Broome , many of them flying boats used for refugee transport and moored in Roebuck Bay . Winckel suffered severe burns to his hand during the attack , as he had to hold the machine @-@ gun barrel to aim . His hand was treated and Winckel flew medical evacuations for the next two days without rest . 
 Meanwhile , Japanese forces were taking over Java and threatening the Allied headquarters at Bandung . On 5 March , the Allied command decided that several senior RAF and RAAF officers had to be evacuated from Bandung . Winckel was chosen as the pilot . He protested the decision , arguing that his lack of rest would hinder his chances of finding Bandung in the dark as he did not have any electronic aids . However , Winckel was seen to be one of the most experienced pilots because of his terrain knowledge as a flight instructor at Bandung and his recent refugee flights . Another factor was that his Lodestar , although it had been damaged in the attack on Broome , was considered the most suitable plane for the evacuation mission . Winckel flew to Java , where he managed to land his plane on a road lit by jeep headlights . He picked up fourteen passengers , refuelled the plane and successfully returned to Australia . 
 = = Later service and life = = 
 Following the attack on Broome and his evacuation mission , Winckel was sent to Moruya , New South Wales , where he joined No. 18 ( Netherlands East Indies ) Squadron RAAF , which had been formed on 4 April 1942 . From Moruya he patrolled the Eastern Australian shore . At the end of May 1942 , a Japanese midget submarine attacked Sydney Harbour . Winckel and his fellow pilots were subsequently ordered to patrol for submarines . During a patrol on 5 June 1942 , Winckel managed to sink a Japanese submarine in his B @-@ 25 Mitchell bomber . The success was welcomed after the recent submarine attack and Winckel was personally congratulated by Australian Prime Minister John Curtin . Winckel spend the rest of the war with No. 18 Squadron and served from MacDonald Airfield and Batchelor Airfield in Northern Australia as a pilot on operations , and as an instructor working in Canberra . During the war , he was nicknamed " Lucky Bill " by his colleagues and " Babyface Killer " by the Japanese . 
 While a member of No. 18 Squadron , Winckel flew to the Dutch East Indies in late 1945 as part of an unauthorized " Recovery of Allied Prisoners of War and Internees " mission . Winckel was searching for his mother and sister but was unable to find them . Some time later another pilot flew over the <unk> Biroe internment camp and saw the name ' <unk> ' written on the ground with flour . This was the name of Winckel 's sister , to draw the attention of her brother , who she assumed was looking for her . Shortly afterwards , Winckel himself flew over the camp and dropped a letter to her , followed four days by a supply of food . After the war , Winckel was sent back to Indonesia to fight in the Dutch Politionele acties . 
 Winckel had met his future wife Yvonne prior to World War II ; they were married during the Dutch Politionele acties . The couple fled Indonesia after the country achieved its independence , and returned to the Netherlands where Winckel became an Air Force test pilot . The couple emigrated to New Zealand in 1951 . Winckel gained his commercial pilot license there and joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force Reserve . He flew de Havilland Tiger Moths out of Wanganui for a time but resigned as he considered the flying too dangerous owing to lax safety standards . The family moved to Nelson and Winckel found work in a flying school . He made his final flight in 1960 . Afterwards he ran several businesses and worked as an engineer until 1977 . He and his wife moved to Queensland , Australia , three years later . They returned to New Zealand in 2005 and settled down in <unk> . 
 In 2009 , a statue in Moruya was unveiled for Winckel and the other airmen that flew out of the airfield ; Winckel and Member of Parliament Mike Kelly attended . A street in Broome was also named after Winckel . He died on 17 August 2013 after suffering complications of a broken hip caused by a fall six months earlier ; he was survived by Yvonne and their three sons .

 = Gate to the Northwest Passage = 
 Gate to the Northwest Passage is a 1980 sculpture by Alan Chung Hung , located adjacent to the Vancouver Maritime Museum in Vanier Park in the <unk> neighborhood of Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada . The 4 @.@ 6 @-@ metre ( 15 ft ) sculpture of a square , cut and twisted " like a paper clip " to form an arch , is composed of weathered Corten steel that rusts to provide a protective layer . The work was installed in 1980 to commemorate the arrival of Captain George Vancouver in Burrard Inlet , following a competition sponsored by Parks Canada one year prior . Gate to the Northwest Passage received an adverse reaction initially , but reception has improved over time . The sculpture has been included in walking tours of the surrounding neighborhoods as a highlight of Vanier Park . 
 = = Background = = 
 Gate to the Northwest Passage was designed by Alan Chung Hung ( 1946 – 1994 ) , who was born in Canton , China , moved to Vancouver in 1969 , and studied at the Vancouver School of Art . In 1979 , Parks Canada sponsored a competition for a permanent work to commemorate Captain George Vancouver , the first European to enter Burrard Inlet , in 1792 . Guidelines for the competition required the use of permanent materials other than wood and that the work should " not be in the likeness of a man " . Hugh Faulkner , Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development during 1977 – 1979 , offered the opportunity for the sculpture , and the project was recommended by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada . Gate to the Northwest Passage was selected by a five @-@ person jury , led by former parks superintendent Stuart <unk> , then confirmed by the Parks Board . The work was originally to be installed at Stanley Park 's Ferguson Point , but was sited in Vanier Park adjacent to the Vancouver Maritime Museum in 1980 . Chung Hung 's other works displayed in Vancouver include Spring ( 1981 ) and Clouds ( 1991 ) . 
 The 4 @.@ 6 @-@ metre ( 15 ft ) sculpture of a square , cut and twisted " like a paper clip " to form an arch , is composed of weathered Corten steel . Each of the square 's sides measure 0 @.@ 9 metres ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) x 0 @.@ 9 metres ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) . The Corten steel rusts , forming a protective layer at the surface . The work , sited on a plaza of paving stones that measures 7 @.@ 9 metres ( 26 ft ) x 8 @.@ 5 metres ( 28 ft ) , frames views of English Bay , the North Shore Mountains and the city . In their guide for public art in Vancouver , John <unk> and Aileen Stalker suggested two sources for the sculpture 's design : Chung Hung 's training as a civil engineer , and the shapes of plane tables and quadrants , both navigational instruments used by George Vancouver . According to Chung Hung : " The objective of the sculpture is to create a symbolic image with definite visual expression , awakening an awareness in Captain George Vancouver 's contribution to the world , his remarkable and meticulous surveys which included the north Pacific coast . " The sculpture is owned by the City of Vancouver , with Parks Canada serving as the sponsoring organization .

 According to the City of Vancouver Public Art Registry , Gate to the Northwest Passage initially received an adverse reaction from local residents . Michael Duncan , then chief curator of the Vancouver Maritime Museum , called it " a bloody monstrosity " . One member of the five @-@ person jury responded to the criticism : " If people think Hung 's sculpture is a poor catch , they should have seen the ones that got away . " 
 A 1983 article published in The Globe and Mail referred to the sculpture as the " world 's largest paper clip " . The same article included a statement from the city planning study : " Vancouver 's peerless natural setting is a permanent gift from nature . So massive and close are the North Shore mountains that no amount of human folly can ever obliterate them . " 
 Reception of the work , which has become a familiar landmark , has improved over time . One travel guide by Eyewitness Books referred to Gate to the Northwest Passage as an " imposing giant red steel " sculpture . Frommer 's includes the sculpture in walking tours for Vancouver as a highlight of Vanier Park . 
 In 2006 , the work was mentioned in a Sunday serial thriller for The Province by author Daniel Kalla . In the series , the sculpture is described as a " massive Greek letter pi " , and later a character is found dead , hanging from the sculpture .

 M @-@ 168 was one of the shortest state trunkline highways in the US state of Michigan , extending 0 @.@ 953 miles ( 1 @.@ 534 km ) from a junction with M @-@ 22 in downtown Elberta to the former Ann Arbor Railroad ferry docks . It followed the south shore of Lake Betsie ( formed by the Betsie River before flowing into Lake Michigan ) . The highway was commissioned in 1931 and served as a connection to the car ferries until 1984 . The road was being reconstructed by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) in preparation to transfer it to village control . That transfer happened on April 24 , 2012 , and now the former highway is a village street .

 M @-@ 168 began at a junction with M @-@ 22 just west of where M @-@ 22 crosses over Lake Betsie . Known as Frankfort Avenue , M @-@ 168 then traveled to the northwest near the shore of the lake through a mixed residential and commercial area before turning slightly westward onto Furnace Avenue . Along Furnace Avenue , the roadway is lined with homes on one side and lake frontage on the other . Eventually , the road curves to the west where it intersects Betsie Valley Trail coming to its terminus shortly thereafter at the former Ann Arbor Railroad ferry docks .

 M @-@ 168 had existed in its current location since 1931 . It was originally assumed into the state trunkline system at 0 @.@ 8 miles ( 1 @.@ 3 km ) in length . Aside from a minor realignment of the junction with M @-@ 22 in 1987 , the route had remained in this configuration since 1931 . From its creation until 1984 , the road was the main entrance for cars bound for boarding the car ferry . 
 An MDOT document indicated that in 2010 , a $ 2 @.@ 1 million project would reconstruct M @-@ 168 . Upon completion of the project , the route would be <unk> transferred to the Village of Elberta , thereby removing M @-@ 168 from the state trunkline system . This transfer was finalized on April 24 , 2012 , and afterwards , the former M @-@ 168 was reclassified a village street .

The Tuesday episode featured the Power of Veto competition and the Power of Veto ceremony , along with more highlights of recent events in the game . Some changes to the scheduling format were made .

The series was broadcast on Global Television Network in Canada . For the first time in the history of the show , Big Brother had a two @-@ hour live season finale , which aired on September 15 , an increase from the usual hour . 
 Much like the previous editions , the live feeds were also available again for this season . HouseGuests enter the house a few days before the premiere , and the feeds are not live for the first few days . They later go live after the broadcast of the launch episode . This season saw the cancellation of the spin @-@ off series House Calls : The Big Brother Talk Show . This made it the first season since Big Brother 4 to not feature the companion show , though various events and talk shows have been hosted by the live feed providers since the show 's cancellation . This season did , however , see the return of the Big Brother : After Dark spin @-@ off series , which aired on Showtime Too nightly from 12 a.m. to 3 a.m. Eastern Time .

 As with each season since Big Brother 6 , the program was filmed at CBS Studios in Studio City , California . The production team was located in the second story of the House which included the story department , audio department and the switchers and shaders . The House was equipped with 52 cameras and 80 microphones to record the participants . The art department that created the competitions for the program was located outside the House . The House theme was eco @-@ friendly and modern California living was released on June 29 during media day , where select members of the press were invited to spend 12 hours inside the House . Official pictures of the House interior were released by CBS on the same day , showing the living room , bedrooms , kitchen , bathroom , lounge room and backyard . The living room featured chipboard walls with fake plants along the side . 
 The spa that was featured in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power a light bulb . The former spa room featured recycled products like wood , plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper . There was also a shipping container @-@ based bathroom , an open kitchen that paid respects to the Pacific Rim and a portable garden where the HouseGuests would collect compost and grow their own herb garden was added to the backyard . The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort . The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design , while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices . The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have @-@ Not room , which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds . 
 = = Format = = 
 The format remained largely unchanged from previous seasons . HouseGuests were incarcerated in the Big Brother House with no contact to and from the outside world . Each week , the HouseGuests took part in several compulsory challenges that determined who would win food , luxuries and power in the House . The winner of the Head of Household competition was immune from nominations and was instructed to nominate two fellow HouseGuests for eviction . After a HouseGuest became Head of Household he or she was ineligible to take part in the next Head of Household competition . The winner of the Power of Veto competition won the right to save one of the nominated HouseGuests from eviction . If the Veto winner exercised the power , the Head of Household then had to nominate another HouseGuest for eviction . 
 On eviction night all HouseGuests except for the Head of Household and the two nominees voted to evict one of the two nominees . Before the voting began the nominees had the chance to say a final message to their fellow HouseGuests . This compulsory vote was conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room by the host Julie Chen . In the event of a tie , the Head of Household would break the tie and reveal their vote in front of the other HouseGuests . Unlike other versions of Big Brother , the HouseGuests could discuss the nomination and eviction process open and freely . The nominee with the most votes from the other HouseGuests was evicted from the House on Thursday and interviewed by Julie Chen . HouseGuests could voluntarily leave the House at any time and those who broke the rules were expelled by Big Brother . The last seven <unk> of the season form the Jury that voted for the winner on the season finale , they were known as the jury members . The jury members were sequestered in a separate house and were not allowed to watch the show except for segments that included all of the HouseGuests . The jury members were not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that included strategy or details regarding nominations . 
 In a change from previous seasons , the food competitions were changed to Have vs. Have @-@ Not competitions . HouseGuests were divided into either the " <unk> " or the " Have Nots " depending on their performance in the competitions . HouseGuests that became " Have Nots " for the week were only allowed to eat slop and a weekly food restriction , chosen by the viewing public , cold showers and sleeping on metal beds . A new rule was revealed this season , in the event a HouseGuest that would be part of the jury to determine the winner voluntarily leaves the House or is expelled by Big Brother the American public replaced that HouseGuest on the jury and voted for the winner along with the remaining jury members .

 Twelve of the thirteen HouseGuests were revealed during The Early Show on July 1 , 2009 by Julie Chen . During the season premiere the HouseGuests were split into four cliques and Jessie Godderz was revealed as the final HouseGuest during the season premiere on July 9 , 2009 after the Athletes clique won the first Head of Household competition .

 On Day 1 , the original twelve HouseGuests entered the house . Following introductions , the HouseGuests learned of the season 's twist , in which they would be playing as members of common high school cliques . Despite this , HouseGuests continued to play the game as individuals and competed in competitions as individuals , were nominated as individuals , and were evicted as individuals . They also learned that if a member of their clique won Head of Household , they could not be nominated for eviction . Upon entering the backyard to compete in their first Head of Household competition , the HouseGuests learned what cliques they would be playing as . HouseGuests Jeff , Natalie , and Russell were in the Athletes clique , while Chima , Michele , and Ronnie were in the Brains clique . Casey , Kevin , and Lydia were placed in the Offbeat clique , leaving Braden , Jordan , and Laura in the Popular clique . Following this , HouseGuests competed in the " The Wedgie " Head of Household competition . For this competition , HouseGuests wore a pair of over @-@ sized underwear and held onto a toilet seat while being suspended in air by the underwear . The last HouseGuest remaining in the air would earn a fourth member to their clique , with this member becoming the first Head of Household of the season . The four eligible HouseGuests to enter the game were former HouseGuests Michael " Cowboy " Ellis for the Offbeat clique , Jessica <unk> for the Popular clique , Brian Hart for the Brains clique , and Jessie Godderz for the Athletes clique . Natalie and Russell were the last two HouseGuests remaining , thus earned immunity for their clique and allowed them to earn a fourth clique member ; Jessie entered the house as their fourth clique member , and became the first Head of Household of the season . Jessie 's entrance to the house brought the total number of HouseGuests to thirteen . In an attempt to keep himself safe , Ronnie and Jessie later formed an alliance between the Brains clique and the Athletes clique . Hoping to hide their alliance , Jessie and Natalie later proposed Ronnie be nominated as a pawn , however , he quickly refused to do so . 
 On Day 4 , HouseGuests competed in the " Big Brother Rave " Have @-@ Not competition . For this competition , HouseGuests were required to construct a series of pipes to spell out the word " Have " while neon " Rave Juice " flowed through the piping . If done correctly , the pipes would cause the juice to spill onto a wheel and cause it to spin ; the last team to complete the task would be the Have @-@ Nots for the week . The Brains clique lost the competition , meaning Chima , Michele , and Ronnie were the Have @-@ Nots for the week . This greatly upset Chima , who stated on numerous occasions afterwards that she was debating walking from the game . Jessie took an immediate dislike to Laura , and hoped to put her up , though his clique members attempted to convince him that Lydia should be evicted that week . Due to Ronnie refusing to be nominated as a pawn , Chima later agreed to be nominated as a pawn . On Day 5 , Jessie chose to nominate Chima and Lydia for eviction , with Lydia being his target for eviction . Worried they might not have the votes to keep Chima , Jessie and Russell formed an alliance with Laura in attempt to get her to evict Lydia . When picking players for the Power of Veto competition , Russell , Natalie , and Jeff were selected to compete for the Power of Veto ; Casey was selected to host . On Day 7 , HouseGuests competed in the " Pop Goes the Veto ! " Power of Veto competition . For this competition , HouseGuests had to pop " pimples " on an over @-@ sized face , with various Scrabble tiles inside of them . The HouseGuests would collect tiles and attempt to spell a word with their collected tiles ; the HouseGuest with the longest correctly spelled word would win the Power of Veto . Russell was the winner of the Power of Veto . Following the competition , Jeff engaged in numerous arguments with Russell and Natalie , causing a rift in their clique . In an attempt to save herself , Lydia attempted to convince Russell and Jessie to backdoor Braden that week by taking her off the block as a way to hurt Jeff . Russell later told Ronnie that this was the plan , with Ronnie telling Braden , Jeff , and Jordan about the plan . On Day 9 , Russell chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Lydia from the block , with Braden being nominated in her place . Following Braden 's nomination , Jordan and Laura began campaigning to get the votes for him to stay , and appeared to have themselves , Casey , Jeff , Michele , and Ronnie in agreement ; Ronnie , however , was playing both sides and had no intention of keeping Braden in the game . On Day 12 , Braden became the first HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when Jessie cast the tie @-@ breaker vote in Chima 's favor . 
 Following Braden 's eviction , HouseGuests competed in the " Most Likely To ... " Head of Household competition . For this competition , HouseGuests attempted to correctly guess which clique the viewers felt best fit a certain scenario ; when a HouseGuest answered correctly they could eliminate one contestant from the competition , while an incorrect answer led to their own elimination . Ronnie was the winner . Following the eviction , those who evicted Chima began to speculate that Ronnie had been the HouseGuest to change his vote , though he continued to deny this and blamed Michele . Laura , being one of the first to realize that Ronnie had been the one to change his vote , attempted to turn the other HouseGuests against him , though Chima and Natalie later informed Ronnie of this . On Day 13 , HouseGuests competed in the " Who Knows The Ugly Truth ? " luxury competition . For this competition , former winner Dan <unk> returned to host the competition , in which the HouseGuests were required to answer questions based on what a member of the opposite sex felt . The male and female winners of the competition would win the opportunity to see the film The Ugly Truth , as well as choose the Have @-@ Nots for the week . Casey and Chima are the winners of the prize , and choose the Popular clique , consisting of Jordan and Laura , to be the Have @-@ Nots for the week . Later that day , Ronnie chose to nominate Jeff and Laura for eviction . Ronnie revealed his intentions to be <unk> Russell that week , though his alliance felt as though Russell would have the votes to stay . Following a confrontation between Lydia and Russell , Lydia and Kevin approached Ronnie about <unk> Russell , and Natalie later debated turning on him as she felt he placed a target on her back . When picking players for the Power of Veto competition , Russell , Natalie , and Casey were selected to compete for the Power of Veto ; Lydia was selected to host . On Day 14 , HouseGuests competed in the " Big Brother Mint " Power of Veto competition . For this competition , HouseGuests were given an amount of money and had two minutes to attempt to get that amount of money in change . HouseGuests competed in rounds , and the HouseGuests farthest away from the goal amount each round was eliminated ; the last HouseGuest remaining would win the Power of Veto . Jeff was the winner of the Power of Veto . Despite initially planning on nominating Russell after the Power of Veto was used , Ronnie later began to see Laura as a bigger threat , feeling she was smart enough to figure out his plans . On Day 16 , Jeff chose to use the Power of Veto to remove himself from the block , with Jordan being nominated in his place . When Ronnie lied and stated that Russell was campaigning to keep Laura in the game , he was confronted by the majority of the HouseGuests and accused of lying and playing both sides of the house . Following these events , Russell followed Ronnie around the house calling him names and taunting him for days afterwards . On Day 19 , Laura became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of eight to one . 
 Following Laura 's eviction , HouseGuests competed in the " Buzzworthy " Head of Household competition . For this competition , HouseGuests attempted to launch a ball into a group of buckets in the shape of a honeycomb with the goal of being closest to the center . The HouseGuest who was closest to the center would be the Head of Household . Jessie was the winner . Though numerous HouseGuests expected Ronnie to be nominated that week , Jessie informed Natalie and Russell that he would be making his own decisions that week , rather than listening to the other HouseGuests . Natalie and Russell , fearing he would come after them , suggested that Casey should be targeted that week . On Day 20 , HouseGuests competed in the " Back Yard Bash " Have @-@ Not competition . For this competition , one HouseGuest from each clique competed , and were required to attempt to fill their opponents cans with various plastic ice cubes ; the clique with the most ice cubes in there can would be the Have @-@ Nots for the week . The Brains clique , consisting of Chima , Michele , and Ronnie , were the Have @-@ Nots for the week . Later that day , Jessie chose to nominate Jordan and Michele for eviction , with the intention of seeing Casey be evicted that week . Despite Jessie 's nominations , Casey , Jeff , Jordan , and Michele were still under the impression that Ronnie was the target for eviction rather than Casey . When picking players for the Power of Veto competition , Jeff , Casey , and Chima were selected to compete ; Natalie was selected to host . On Day 21 , HouseGuests competed in the " When Pigs Fly " Power of Veto competition .

Michele was the winner of the Power of Veto . On Day 23 , Michele chose to use the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block , with Casey being nominated in her place . On Day 26 , Casey became the third HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of seven to one . 
 Following Casey 's eviction , the HouseGuests learned that the " <unk> " twist had ended , and that all HouseGuests were playing the game as individuals . They also learned that the viewers would select one HouseGuest to win a " Mystery Power " , though it was not revealed what the power would be . The ten remaining HouseGuests then competed in the " Big Brother Graduation " Head of Household competition . For this competition , HouseGuests sat on " graduation caps " suspended in the air while being hit by a foam diploma ; the last HouseGuest remaining on their cap would be the new Head of Household . Russell was the winner . Jordan , as part of a twist in the competition , had to select three HouseGuests to be Have @-@ Nots for the week ; she chose Jessie , Kevin , and Natalie . Though the two initially had a feud , Jeff and Russell later chose to align with one another . On Day 27 , Russell chose to nominate Lydia and Ronnie for eviction , with Ronnie being his main target . Though Russell was adamant about seeing Ronnie evicted that week , Chima , Jessie , and Natalie hoped to see Lydia be evicted instead . When picking players for the Power of Veto competition , Jessie , Kevin , and Michele were selected to compete ; Chima was selected to host . On Day 28 , HouseGuests competed in the " Vini Vidi Veto " Power of Veto competition . For this competition , HouseGuests had to determine the quantity of an object used to make an object . Each round , HouseGuests could either stay or fold ; folding would allow them to continue in the game , but could not get a point whereas the HouseGuest with the answer closest to the correct one would earn a point , though the farthest was eliminated . Michele was the winner of the Power of Veto . On Day 30 , Michele chose not to use the Power of Veto on either nominee . Following this , Jeff learned that he had won the power of the " Coup d 'Etat " , in which he could overthrow the Head of Household and make his own nominations on the spot ; this power could only be used at the next two evictions , and the current Head of Household and Power of Veto holder were unable to be nominated . On Day 33 , Ronnie became the fourth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of four to three . 
 Following Ronnie 's eviction , HouseGuests competed in the " Say what ? " Head of Household competition .

For this competition , actor Jeremy Piven entered the house to inform the HouseGuests of the competition . The HouseGuests split into teams and were required to fill a station wagon with various items that were worth different amounts of points ; the team would only earn a point for the items they successfully fit into their car , and the team with the most points would earn the right to see the film The Goods . The team of Chima , Jordan , Jessie , Natalie , and Russell won the competition , meaning Jeff , Kevin , Lydia , and Michele were the Have @-@ Nots for the week . Later that day , Chima chose to nominate Lydia and Russell for eviction . When picking players for the Power of Veto competition , Jeff , Kevin , and Natalie were selected to compete ; Michele was selected to host . On Day 35 , HouseGuests competed in the " BB Farm " Power of Veto competition .

On Day 40 , Jeff chose to use the Coup d 'État , thus overthrowing Head of Household Chima . He chose to remove both Lydia and Russell from the block , replacing them with Jessie and Natalie . Due to using the Coup d 'État , Jeff was ineligible to vote during this eviction , as was Chima . Jessie then became the fifth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of three to two . He became the first member of the Jury of Seven . 
 Following Jessie 's eviction , HouseGuests competed in the " Hit the Road " Head of Household competition . Due to the Coup d 'État being used , all of the HouseGuests were able to compete . For this competition , HouseGuests faced off two at a time and were asked questions about past competitions played this season ; the winner of each round would select the next two HouseGuests to face off , with the last HouseGuest remaining being the winner . Michele was the winner . On Day 41 , HouseGuests competed in the " <unk> " Have @-@ Not competition . For this competition , HouseGuests competed in pairs and had to find matching casseroles and place them on a podium labeled with a certain day of the week or luxury prize ; if the HouseGuests had put a correct pair on the podium , they would earn food for that day of the week . The HouseGuests earned food for everyday of the week except for Monday . Though the house was split , the HouseGuests were unsure of which side Michele would choose to stay with ; she later aligned herself with Jeff , Jordan , and Russell , and stated she hoped to see Chima evicted . Later that day , Michele chose to nominate Chima and Natalie for eviction . Though she had often disregarded the rules for the show , Chima began to break rules more consistently following Jessie 's eviction , including covering up cameras , refusing to go to the Diary Room , and not wearing her microphone . Early on Day 42 , Chima broke further rules when she refused to wear her microphone and later threw it into the jacuzzi when Kevin brought her microphone to her . Following this , Chima refused to take an exchange microphone from the storage room . Following further refusal to enter the Diary Room , producer Allison Grodner later spoke through the intercom and convinced Chima to come to the Diary Room . Hours later , the remaining HouseGuests learned that Chima had been expelled from the game . On Day 43 , the HouseGuests learned that Michele 's duty as Head of Household had been fulfilled as Chima was one of Michele 's nominations , and that a new Head of Household competition would take place later that day . 
 Following these events , HouseGuests competed in the " BB Invitational Golf Tournament " Head of Household competition . For this competition , HouseGuests took turns putting a golf ball in an attempt to get it into a hole . If a HouseGuest missed , their ball went into a rotating wheel , with various numbers labeling sections in the wheel . The HouseGuest who 's ball landed in the highest number each round was eliminated from the competition , with the last HouseGuest remaining winning the competition . When a HouseGuest was eliminated from the competition , they could claim a prize , one of which was the Head of Household position . Jordan was the winner . On Day 44 , Jordan chose to nominate Lydia and Natalie for eviction . Shortly afterwards , Kevin , in an attempt to save himself and his allies , lied to Jeff and claimed that he had heard Russell stating he would evict Jeff the following week ; Jeff quickly told this to Jordan , and the two believed him . When picking players for the Power of Veto competition , Jeff , Kevin , and Michele were selected to compete . On Day 47 , HouseGuests competed live in the " Before or After " Power of Veto competition .

Lydia then became the sixth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of three to one . She became the second member of the Jury of Seven . 
 Following Lydia 's eviction , HouseGuests competed in the " Can Do " Head of Household competition . For this competition , HouseGuests stood atop a platform and attempted to drop aluminum cans into plastic tubes ; the first HouseGuest to drop twenty @-@ four cans into their tube would be the winner . Jeff was the winner . Due to having the least amount of cans in their tubes , Michele and Russell became the Have @-@ Nots for the week . Due to the lie that Kevin had told Jeff , both Jeff and Jordan hoped to see Russell evicted . In an attempt to save themselves , Kevin and Natalie made a deal to get to the final four with Jeff and Jordan , and Jeff later told them he would nominate them as pawns in an attempt to backdoor Russell . On Day 48 , Jeff chose to nominate Kevin and Natalie for eviction . Though Jeff continued to assure Michele and Russell that the plan was to evict Kevin , the two became suspicious that the plan was to backdoor one of them . On Day 49 , HouseGuests competed in the " Otev the Ape " Power of Veto competition . For this competition , HouseGuests were given a riddle by Otev the Ape and were required to search through various bananas in the backyard with the names of previously evicted HouseGuests on them to find the banana that would solve the riddle . The last HouseGuest to bring Otev the correct banana , or the HouseGuest who brought an incorrect banana , were eliminated each round . Jeff was the winner of the Power of Veto . On Day 51 , Jeff chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Kevin from the block , with Russell being nominated in his place .

For this competition , HouseGuests were required to walk back and forth transferring cups of hot chocolate to a jar on the opposite side of the backyard . The first HouseGuest to fill up their jar and claim the ball inside would be the winner of the competition . Kevin was the winner . Despite making a deal with him the previous week , Kevin and Natalie later made a plan to backdoor Jeff as they saw him as their biggest threat . Though this was his plan , Kevin and Natalie also debated taking out Michele , and thus feared that Jeff could win the Power of Veto and save Jordan if she were to be nominated ; should Jeff use the Power of Veto on Jordan , it would force Kevin to nominate Natalie for eviction . On Day 55 , Kevin chose to nominate Jeff and Michele for eviction . Later that day , Kevin discovered a secret room in the Head of Household bedroom known as Pandora 's Box ; upon entering the room , he discovered a box and learned that placing his hand inside the box would release $ 10 @,@ 000 into the house . He did so , and became locked inside the box while the money fell into the backyard ; the HouseGuests were able to keep the money , and were required to find a key to unlock Kevin from the room . On Day 56 , HouseGuests competed in the " <unk> " Power of Veto competition . For this competition , HouseGuests had to correctly figure out which two faces of the HouseGuests made up a set of alien faces . The HouseGuest who finished the competition in the fastest amount of time was the winner . Michele was the winner of the Power of Veto . On Day 58 , Michele chose to use the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block , with Jordan being nominated in her place . On Day 61 , Jeff became the eighth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when Kevin cast a tiebreaker vote in Jordan 's favor . He became the fourth member of the Jury of Seven . 
 Following Jeff 's eviction , HouseGuests competed in the " Fact or Fiction " Head of Household competition . For this competition , HouseGuests were given statements , and had to determine whether this statement was fact or fiction . Natalie was the winner . That night , HouseGuests competed in the " Big Brother Shopping Spree " luxury competition . For this competition , HouseGuests competed with a partner and were required to communicate with each other from across a wall in an attempt to find matching articles of clothing ; the group had ten minutes to complete a full outfit , with whatever time they had left over being used to give the HouseGuests a shopping spree . On Day 62 , Natalie was presented with Pandora 's Box and learned that her boyfriend was inside , however , if she chose to enter and see him she would give up her right to compete in the final Power of Veto competition ; she accepted the offer , and entered Pandora 's Box . Despite this , she later lied to her fellow HouseGuests about what had happened . Later that day , Natalie chose to nominate Kevin and Michele for eviction . On Day 63 , HouseGuests competed in the " There Ain 't No Party Like A Veto Block Party " final Power of Veto competition . For this competition , HouseGuests were given twenty clues , lined up ten by ten and were required to match blocks with HouseGuests names on them with the clues provided ; the HouseGuest to complete this in the fastest time would be the winner . Kevin was the winner of the final Power of Veto . On Day 66 , Kevin chose to use the Power of Veto to remove himself from the block , with Jordan being nominated in his place . Minutes later , he cast the sole vote to evict Michele from the house . She became the fifth member of the Jury of Seven . 
 Following Michele 's eviction , the final three HouseGuests began competing in the first part of the final Head of Household competition " Log Jam . " The HouseGuests held onto their key that was suspended in the air for as long as possible while trying not to fall off of a moving log . Jordan was the first to fall off of the log while Kevin won the first part of the competition and advanced to the third and final round . Jordan and Natalie were the only two HouseGuests to compete in the second round which , determined who would face Kevin in the final round . In the second round , called " Heads Will Roll " , each HouseGuest entered the backyard alone with a giant game table with the numbers one through ten . Each player used balls with names of previous Head of Household winners and place the ball with the correct name into the hole that corresponds with the numerical order in which they reigned . The player had a two @-@ minute time limit and the player with the most correct answers won . Jordan was the winner . Kevin and Jordan competed in the final part of the Head of Household competition called " Jury Statements . " The players had to guess the ending of statements made by the jury members . There were two possible answers and the players had to guess the correct ending by picking A or B. Jordan was the winner , becoming the final Head of Household of the season . Jordan chose to evict Kevin from the house , making Jordan and Natalie the Final Two . Jordan was later crowned the winner of Big Brother 11 in a vote of five to two , with Chima 's vote being replaced with a vote from the viewers .

 = = = Comparison to British edition = = = 
 After two weeks into the season several news sites began to compare the American and British version of the show , which was six weeks into its series at the time . During the first several weeks ratings for both shows were declining . The launch of Big Brother 2009 aired on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom premiered on June 4 attracted 4 @.@ 8 million viewers , with a 22 % viewing share . The show was down compared to the launch of Big Brother 2008 but won its timeslot . Ratings continued to decline with the first official eviction of the series , that aired on June 12 only pulling in 2 @.@ 9 million people , 13 % of the viewing audience . 
 In an article by The Hollywood Reporter , an American trade publication , noted the tenth series of the British version was averaging 2 million viewers and a 10 @.@ 1 % audience share . At the time the show was six weeks into its run and was down 33 % on its performance from the previous year and very down when compared to previous series in where some average 6 million viewers per episode . Mimi Turner , author of the article , noted the show was " running out of steam " and until the tenth series the show delivered significant youth audiences on air and online . Bill Gorman of <unk> , an American television website , commented on the article by saying " Not sure if this is a glimpse of things to come for the US version of Big Brother or not . " 
 Executives from Endemol , the production company for Big Brother worldwide , defended the format which is transmitted in 41 territories and noted the season premiere of the 11th season in America won its timeslot with year @-@ to @-@ year growth . Other comparisons noted was the finale of ninth season of Italy 's Grande Fratello pulled 7 @.@ 9 million viewers with a 36 % audience share and how in Argentina the show has been rested for a few years and returns with stronger ratings . Paul Jonson , global head of marketing and brand partnerships for Endemol Group , noted that using audience averages to figure out how the show performs wouldn 't work since the audience builds up until the finale . Jonson also noted that the series continued to rate very well when compared to the timeslot average for Channel 4 . 
 After ratings for Big Brother 11 in America began to increase Anna Pickard , for The Guardian in the United Kingdom , compared the two concurrent seasons noting the format differences between the American and British versions of the show calling the two " different beasts . " Various points mentioned that contributed to the increase in ratings was the number of episodes per week , format differences , lack of live feeds from the House in Britain . In another article on the same site noted the American version experienced a " ratings renaissance " in a market " which the format has not traditionally done well . " After the provisional cancellation of Big Brother in the United Kingdom , American trade publications like USA Today began reporting on the cancellation while others like Variety were also reporting various pickups around the world including the twelfth season of the American version , Big Brother 10 in Germany , Grande Fratello 10 in Italy and <unk> <unk> 2 in Israel . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 During the first week of the program several HouseGuests made controversial remarks during several arguments on the live Internet feeds . Many homophobic comments made by Jeff during an argument with Russell after the first Power of Veto ceremony were edited out of the first Tuesday broadcast episode while the comments remained uncensored online . 
 Another HouseGuest , Braden , made several racist and derogatory comments after the first Power of Veto ceremony to fellow HouseGuests Kevin and Lydia in an argument . The argument was edited during the first live eviction show on Thursday but played unedited on the live feeds . During the live portion of the show , Chima brought up the comments made by Braden again during her final plea speech to her fellow HouseGuests . Chima also stated Braden used a sexually insulting word to describe Big Brother host Julie Chen . This comment was made at the conclusion of a " Julie Says " game played by the HouseGuests a couple nights earlier as viewed on Big Brother After Dark . 
 The editing of the events in question during the broadcast episodes created controversy for the show and CBS , the broadcaster of Big Brother . While the comments couldn 't air due to FCC regulations the way the events were edited caused critics and fans of the show to claim the show was being edited to make the HouseGuests look good to the viewing public . One critic suggests the recent decline in ratings is due to the editing process of the show . 
 Chima revealed to her fellow HouseGuests on the live Internet feeds and on Big Brother : After Dark after the eviction that she was informed in the Diary Room by Big Brother , the producers , that her comments were censored during the live broadcast . 
 " I said , I don 't think it 's fair because I don 't think they showed when it first was said , and I was like , ' If someone 's a racist , they should be portrayed as one . You shouldn 't edit it to make them look good . ' " 
 CBS released a statement on July 17 , 2009 regarding the censoring of the controversial statements saying the statements in question were offensive and did not meet the network 's standards . CBS also stated that " any views or opinions expressed in personal commentary by a houseguest appearing on Big Brother , either on any live feed from the house or the broadcast , are those of the individuals speaking and do not represent the views or opinions of CBS or the producers of the program . " National Public Radio 's pop culture correspondent Linda Holmes noted that CBS officially disavowing such statements while allowing them to continue amounts to a publicity grab for the show and for the network : 
 " This show is meant to get a good part of its attention from the difference between what you see online and what you see on the show . If it manages to cast a hard @-@ charging racist whose work only appears online , it can seize all the attention of a scandal while claiming that it 's tastefully trying to protect viewers from anything ' offensive .

 = Music of the Mother series = 
 The Mother series is a role @-@ playing video game series created by Shigesato Itoi for Nintendo . The series started in 1989 with the Japan @-@ only release of Mother , which was followed up by Mother 2 , released as EarthBound outside Japan , for the Super NES in 1994 . A second sequel was released in Japan only , Mother 3 , for the Game Boy Advance in 2006 . The music of the Mother series includes the soundtracks to all three games ; the first game was composed for by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka , who were joined by Hiroshi Kanazu for the second game , while Mother 3 's score was written by Shogo Sakai . 
 The music has inspired several album releases . Mother saw the release in 1989 of an album primarily composed of vocal arrangements of pieces from its soundtrack ; this album was re @-@ released in 2004 in an expanded form . Earthbound had a soundtrack album associated with the game released in 1994 and again in 2004 that contained both original tracks from the game and medleys of multiple tracks . A compilation release , Mother 1 + 2 , received a soundtrack album release in 2003 , as well as an album of MIDI piano versions of songs from the two games in 2006 . The latest release in the series , Mother 3 , has two soundtrack albums : Mother 3 + , released in 2006 , and the online @-@ only release Mother 3i in 2007 . 
 The games ' soundtracks have received primarily positive reviews , and the music itself has gone on to some popularity . Multiple piano sheet music books of pieces from the series have been produced , and the " Eight Melodies " song originally featured in Mother has been included in some Japanese music textbooks . Music from the series has been used in the Super Smash Bros. series of fighting games , has been played in orchestral game music concerts , and been remixed for websites such as OverClocked Remix . 
 = = Mother = = 
 Mother ( マザー , Mazā ) , later re @-@ released as EarthBound Beginnings , is a role @-@ playing video game published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System video game console in 1989 . The game 's soundtrack was composed by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka . Tanaka was a video game composer working for Nintendo who had previously composed for games such as Super Mario Land and Metroid , while Suzuki was a composer and musician for bands of many different genres . The NES was only able to play three notes at a time , which Suzuki has noted greatly limited what he was able to produce , as he could not create some of the sounds he wanted . Melodies and themes from some pieces from the soundtrack were reused in the other games in the series . ( " Pollyanna " and " Snowman " make an appearance in all three games . ) 
 Some of the music from the game was recorded as a studio album by Suzuki and Tanaka in collaboration with various artists entitled Mother . The album was released by CBS / Sony on August 21 , 1989 . It consists of eleven tracks , seven of which are English vocal arrangements of songs from the game created by Suzuki , David Bedford , Takeshi <unk> , and Michael Nyman . The lyrics to these arrangements were written by Linda <unk> . Each of the first ten tracks were performed by a different artist or group such as Catherine Warwick and St Paul 's Cathedral Choir . The pieces were recorded at eight different studios in England , and a final 16 @-@ minute capstone track , " The World of Mother " , included most of the tracks from the game itself played back to back in their order of appearance in the game . The album cover shows the word " MOTHER " in a shade of brown over a red background ; the letter " O " of " MOTHER " is replaced by an image of planet Earth , also with a brownish tinge . The soundtrack was reissued on February 18 , 2004 by Sony Music Direct with its tracks digitally remastered , a song from EarthBound entitled " Smiles and Tears " was added , and the track " The World of Mother " was replaced with a version that is six minutes longer . 
 Despite being recorded in England , the album was only available in Japan , as the game was never released outside of the country until a Virtual Console release over 25 years later . Following a Kickstarter campaign , the American independent record label Ship to Shore <unk> worked with Sony Music to reissue the album on vinyl record in 2015 . Only 2 @,@ 000 copies were pressed , though a limited run of CD albums was also produced . 
 <unk> 's Gavin Sheehan wrote : " This soundtrack is gorgeous , at least for the time it was created in . " He noted the experimental style of the tracks , which he credited to the experimental style of the game itself as well as the relative newness of the genre of video game music at the time . Reviewer Patrick Gann of RPGFan received the album well , saying that he enjoyed the variety of genres presented in it , though he noted that the lyrics were " trite and cheesy " , though still " catchy " . He also applauded the production value , calling it " incredible , especially for 1989 " . Square Enix Music Online , in their review of the album , called it " a happy little gem with quirks and surprises " . Though unlike RPGFan they felt that the sound production quality was not as good as it could be , they still felt that the pieces had " stood the test of time in terms of good music " . 
 = = EarthBound = = 
 EarthBound , known in Japan as Mother 2 : Gyiyg no <unk> ( <unk> , Mazā Tsū <unk> no <unk> , lit . " Mother 2 : Gyiyg Strikes Back " ) , is a role @-@ playing video game published by Nintendo for the Super NES video game console in 1994 . Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka reprised their roles from Mother as composers for the game , and were joined by assistant composers Hiroshi Kanazu and Toshiyuki Ueno . In an interview with Weekly Famitsu , Keiichi Suzuki commented on how the SNES gave the composers much more freedom to compose what they wanted than the NES , which made development of the music for EarthBound much easier than for its predecessor . This freedom was partially a result of the larger memory space available , because one of the many problems the composers had in the first game was trying to get all of their music on to the cartridge . Another advantage was that the SNES could support playing eight notes at the same time , which when combined with the increased sound quality meant that he could compose music for the game in a similar fashion to how he would compose music for real life . Suzuki cited John Lennon as an influential figure to all the composers while the soundtrack was being developed , as his songs about love matched up with the feeling of the game . Critics and players have noted similarities between parts of some songs in the game to popular songs , including several suspected homages to songs by Lennon and The Beatles . Legal issues surrounding these similarities were suspected to prevent the game from being released on the Virtual Console outside of Japan , but the rumors were ultimately proved untrue . 
 In a Famitsu interview , Shigesato Itoi said that the amount of music that they fit into eight megabits of space , one @-@ third of the total size of the game , would be enough to fill two Compact Discs if released as a full album . He ascribed the amount of music to the " disorderly " , or broad , amount of styles of music that were included by Tanaka and Suzuki . He also noted his belief that EarthBound was the first video game to include vibrato , or " string @-@ bending " , in its music , and described one of the differences between the music of EarthBound and Mother as that this game had more " jazzy " pieces . Suzuki has estimated that he composed over 100 pieces of music for EarthBound , including songs that did not make it into the game , and says that his favorite was the music played when the player rode a bicycle in the game , which he had actually composed before starting work on the game . 
 The soundtrack album for EarthBound was released by Sony Records in Japan on November 2 , 1994 . It was re @-@ released a decade later on February 18 , 2004 by Sony Music Direct . The album has 24 tracks , where many of these tracks are arrangements combining several pieces from the game into one piece . The final three tracks on the album consist of remixes of multiple tracks merged ; for example , " Room Number ( PSI <unk> ) " is a remixed version of several pieces of music played in different shops and hotels in the game combined into one song . The album was released again in 2016 by Ship to Shore as a set of two vinyl LP records , with four color options for the discs . The album , named Mother 2 , uses the same tracks and artwork as the original soundtrack release . 
 Vincent Chorley , in his review of the album for RPGFan , praised the original game music , applauding it for " conveying emotion and atmosphere , and then playing around with this mental image " . As for the album itself , however , he was disappointed in the way that it merged tracks together and kept tracks based on a single song short , saying that " many of the tracks are so short that they are impossible to enjoy in their entirety " . The vinyl release was praised by Jeremy Parish of USGamer for its sound quality and the soundtrack 's " towering achievement in game music " , but he felt that the music was not very " listenable " on its own , and that the album did not fit the LP format as well as an album originally produced for the format would have . 
 = = Mother 1 + 2 = = 
 The video game Mother 1 + 2 ( MOTHER 1 + 2 , Mazā Wan Tsū ) is a port release of Mother and EarthBound ( Mother 2 ) by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance , released in 2003 . Despite its title , the eponymous album is an arranged album . It was released by Toshiba @-@ EMI on August 20 , 2003 . The first ten tracks from the album are from Mother , while the last 16 are from Earthbound . Unlike the original soundtrack albums , the Mother tracks on this album did not include any vocal arrangements and the Earthbound tracks were not composed of tracks merged . Another album for the collection , Mother 1 + 2 midi Piano Version , was released three years later on May 27 , 2006 by Sky Port Publishing . The album contains MIDI piano arrangements by Shunsuke Sakamoto of songs from the two games with its music covering many different moods , from " lively to sedated " . Like the soundtrack album , Mother 1 + 2 midi Piano Version had its first ten tracks taken from Mother and the other 16 from Earthbound , but with several different tracks than the first album . 
 Kyle Miller of RPGFan , in his review of the Mother 1 + 2 album , called it " a quality collection of uplifting , passionate songs " . He preferred the Mother tracks to the Earthbound ones , as he felt that the second half of the album contained more " gimmick " tracks , but still called both halves " unique , fun , and well done overall " . In his review of the Mother 1 + 2 midi Piano Version album , he concluded that while " fans of midi piano music " would enjoy the album , that the soundtrack album was the superior of the two . His criticism was mainly based on the fact that , while the tracks were " well orchestrated pieces " , " played masterfully " , and retained the " quality of the compositions " of the originals , the " wacky instrumentation " of the original pieces did not translate to piano arrangements , causing the tunes to " lose some of the spirit that they are known for " . 
 = = Mother 3 = = 
 Mother 3 is a role @-@ playing video game published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console in 2006 . The music for the game was composed exclusively by Shogo Sakai , who he had previously composed music for games such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and Kirby Air Ride . Series developer Shigesato Itoi stated that Sakai was given the position because he understood Mother 3 the most , given that he could not use Keiichi Suzuki or Hirokazu Tanaka , the composers for the first two games , as they were both busy with other projects . Itoi also said that given the massive amount of songs in the game , over 250 , he needed someone who had a lot of time to dedicate to the project and who could focus exclusively on it . 
 " Love Theme " , the main theme of Mother 3 , was composed late in the game 's development ; earlier in development Itoi intended to use the " Pigmask Army " theme as the main theme of the game . During creation of an important scene in the game , however , Sakai was asked to create a song that would have a greater impact than the Pigmask theme ; upon its creation it was chosen to be used as the main theme instead of the " Pigmask Army " song . Itoi claims that , given how quickly Sakai composed the song , that he had been " waiting for the order " to make a song like " Love Theme " . Itoi requested that " Love Theme " be playable on a piano with only one finger , as the " Eight Melodies " theme from Mother had gained popularity and been played in elementary schools due to its simplicity . The " OK desu ka ? " that plays after the player chooses the character 's name was recorded without Itoi 's knowledge by Hirokazu Tanaka more than a decade before the release of Mother 3 . 
 The <unk> + soundtrack album was first released by Tokyo Itoi Shigesato Office on November 2 , 2006 , and then distributed through the iTunes Store on February 2 , 2007 , featuring an additional bonus track , " <unk> – theme of LOVE " . Another album of music from the game , <unk> , was released on February 6 , 2007 by Tokyo Itoi Shigesato Office in the iTunes Store and other online music services . Like the Earthbound soundtrack album each track of <unk> is a combination of several tracks from the game itself , though it still does not cover all of the tracks from the game . 
 Kyle Miller of RPGFan gave a warm reception to <unk> + in his review , saying that it " retains the same quirky , but thoughtful feel so well captured by the previous entries in the series " and was " a worthy addition to the Mother musical canon " . He enjoyed that it included both songs that were new to Mother 3 and pieces originally from previous entries in the series . He felt that the weakest tracks on the album were those that used real @-@ life instruments , while he named " Snowman " as the strongest . Square Enix Music Online was not as pleased with the album ; although the reviewer agreed with Miller on which tracks were the best and worst , they were very critical of the fact that the album contained " only nine or ten distinct themes from a pool of perhaps one hundred viable choices " . They also disliked the fact that the pieces were " by design short and repetitive " . They instead recommended the <unk> album , which , though " missing the iconic ' Love ' theme and perennial series favorites like ' Pollyanna ' " , had " more engaging arrangements , less cloying sentimentality , and a wider variety of themes " . They also noted the improved sound quality of the album over the original Game Boy Advance version . <unk> + reached position # 24 on the Japanese Oricon charts , and stayed on the charts for three weeks .

 Music from EarthBound was arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing in 1995 . The book contains 16 scores , with some covering more than one song from the game . " <unk> 's Theme " was also included in " Game Music Piano Solo Album " , a book published by DOREMI with sheet music from many different games . Sky Port Publishing published a book of piano arrangements in 1996 for the release of Mother 1 + 2 containing 27 pieces . The " Eight Melodies " song from Mother received some popularity , and was included in some Japanese music textbooks due to its simplicity . A full sheet music book for Mother has never officially been made available , but after it 's release on the Virtual Console as Earthbound Beginnings , the entire soundtrack was transcribed by fans into sheet music . Super Smash Bros. , a series of fighting games published by Nintendo featuring characters and music from established video games , has included several songs from the Mother series . The 2016 Undertale , inspired by Earthbound , includes several homages to the game 's music in its soundtrack . 
 " Because I Love You " and " Eagle Land " from EarthBound were played by the Tokyo Memorial Orchestra for the second Orchestral Game Concert on September 15 , 1992 as part of a five concert tour , which was later released as a series of albums . " Because I Love You " was again played in their third concert , and was the only song to make an appearance in more than one concert in the tour . A medley of songs from all three games was performed at the " Press Start -Symphony of Games- 2006 " concert in Tokyo . Selections of remixes of music from the series also appear on Japanese remix albums , called Dōjin , and on English remixing websites such as OverClocked Remix . A group of remixes of Mother and Earthbound music was released as an unofficial download @-@ only album titled Bound Together by a group of artists from OverClocked Remix and elsewhere on October 29 , 2006 containing 48 remixes and almost three hours of music . 
 = Hank Williams = 
 Hiram King " Hank " Williams , ( / <unk> <unk> / ; September 17 , 1923 – January 1 , 1953 ) was an American singer @-@ songwriter and musician . Regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century , Williams recorded 35 singles ( five released posthumously ) that reached the Top 10 of the Billboard Country & Western Best Sellers chart , including 11 that ranked number one ( three posthumously ) . 
 Born in Mount Olive , Butler County , Alabama , Williams moved to Georgiana , where he met Rufus Payne , a black street performer who gave him guitar lessons in exchange for meals or money . Payne had a major influence on Williams ' later musical style , along with Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb . During this time , Williams informally changed his name to Hank , as he had always fantasized about having that name . He moved to Montgomery , where he began his music career in 1937 , when producers at radio station WSFA hired him to perform and host a 15 @-@ minute program . He formed as backup the Drifting Cowboys band , which was managed by his mother , and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career . 
 When several of his band members were conscripted into military service during World War II , Williams had trouble with their replacements , and WSFA terminated his contract because of his alcohol abuse . Williams eventually married Audrey Sheppard , who was his manager for nearly a decade . After recording " Never Again " and " Honky Tonkin ' " with Sterling Records , he signed a contract with MGM Records . In 1948 he released " Move It on Over " , which became a hit , and also joined the Louisiana Hayride radio program . One year later , he released a cover of " Lovesick Blues " , which carried him into the mainstream of music . After an initial rejection , Williams joined the Grand Ole Opry . He was unable to read or notate music to any significant degree . Among the hits he wrote were " Your Cheatin ' Heart " , " Hey , Good Lookin ' " , and " I 'm So Lonesome I Could Cry " . 
 Several years of back pain , alcoholism , and prescription drug abuse severely damaged Williams ' health . He divorced Sheppard and was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcohol abuse . Williams died in 1953 at the age of 29 , from heart failure exacerbated by pills and alcohol . Despite his short life , Williams has had a major influence on 20th @-@ century popular music , especially country music . The songs he wrote and recorded have been covered by numerous artists and have been hits in various genres . He has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame , such as the Country Music Hall of Fame ( 1961 ) , the Songwriters Hall of Fame ( 1970 ) , and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ( 1987 ) .

 Williams was born in Butler County , Alabama , the son of Jessie <unk> " Lillie " ( née Skipper ; August 12 , 1898 – February 26 , 1955 ) and Elonzo <unk> " Lon " Williams ( December 22 , 1891 – October 25 , 1970 ) . His parents married on November 12 , 1916 . Hank Williams was of English ancestry . Elonzo Williams worked as an engineer for the railroads of the W.T. Smith lumber company . He was drafted during World War I , serving from July 1918 until June 1919 . He was severely injured after falling from a truck , breaking his collarbone and suffering a severe blow to the head . After his return , the family 's first child , Irene , was born on August 8 , 1922 . Another son of theirs died shortly after birth . Their third child , Hiram , was born on September 17 , 1923 , in Mount Olive . Since Elonzo Williams was a Mason , and his wife was a member of Order of the Eastern Star the child was named after Hiram I of Tyre ( one of the three founders of the Masons , according to Masonic legend ) , but his name was misspelled as " <unk> " on his birth certificate . 
 As a child , he was nicknamed " Harm " by his family and " <unk> " or " Poots " by his friends . He was born with spina bifida occulta , a disorder of the spinal column , which gave him lifelong pain – a factor in his later abuse of alcohol and drugs . Williams ' father was frequently relocated by the lumber company railway for which he worked , and the family lived in many southern Alabama towns . In 1930 , when Williams was seven years old , his father began suffering from facial paralysis . At a Veterans Affairs ( VA ) clinic in Pensacola , Florida , doctors determined that the cause was a brain aneurysm , and Elonzo was sent to the VA Medical Center in Alexandria , Louisiana . He remained hospitalized for eight years , rendering him mostly absent throughout Hiram 's childhood . From that time on , Lillie Williams assumed responsibility for the family . 
 In the fall of 1934 the Williams family moved to Greenville , Alabama , where Lillie opened a boarding house next to the Butler County courthouse . In 1935 the Williams family settled in Garland , Alabama , where Lillie Williams opened a new boarding house . After a while they moved with his cousin Opal McNeil to Georgiana , Alabama where Lillie managed to find several side jobs to support her children , despite the bleak economic climate of the Great Depression . She worked in a cannery and served as a night @-@ shift nurse in the local hospital . 
 Their first house burned and the family lost its possessions . They moved to a new house on the other side of town on Rose Street , which Williams ' mother soon turned into a boarding house . The house had a small garden , on which they grew diverse crops that Williams and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana . At a chance meeting in Georgiana , Hank Williams met U.S. Representative J. Lister Hill while he was campaigning across Alabama . Williams told Hill that his mother was interested to talk with him about his problems and her need to collect Elonzo Williams ' disability pension . With Hill 's help , the family began collecting the money . Despite his medical condition , the family managed fairly well financially throughout the Great Depression . 
 There are several versions of how Williams got his first guitar . His mother stated that she bought it with money from selling peanuts , but many other prominent residents of the town claimed to have been the one who purchased the guitar for him . While living in Georgiana , Williams met Rufus " Tee @-@ Tot " Payne , a street performer . Payne gave Williams guitar lessons in exchange for meals prepared by Lillie Williams or money . Payne 's base musical style was blues . He taught Williams chords , chord progressions , bass turns , and the musical style of accompaniment that he would use in most of his future songwriting . Later on , Williams recorded one of the songs that Payne taught him , " My Bucket 's Got a Hole in It " . Williams musical style contained influences from Payne along with several other country influences , among them " the Singing Brakeman " Jimmie Rodgers , Moon <unk> , and Roy Acuff . In 1937 Williams got into a fight with his physical education coach about exercises the coach wanted him to do . His mother subsequently demanded that the school board terminate the coach ; when they refused , the family moved to Montgomery , Alabama . Payne and Williams lost touch , though eventually , Payne also moved to Montgomery , where he died in poverty in 1939 . Williams later credited him as his only teacher .

 In July 1937 , the Williams and McNeil families opened a boarding house on South Perry Street in downtown Montgomery . It was at this time that Williams decided to change his name informally from Hiram to Hank , a name he said was better suited to his desired career in country music . During the same year he participated in a talent show at the Empire Theater . He won the first prize of $ 15 , singing his first original song " WPA Blues " . Williams wrote the lyrics and used the tune of Riley Puckett 's " Dissatisfied . " He never learned to read music and , for the rest of his career , based his compositions in storytelling . After school and on weekends Williams sang and played his Silvertone guitar on the sidewalk in front of the WSFA radio studios . His recent win at the Empire Theater and the street performances caught the attention of WSFA producers who occasionally invited him to perform on air . So many listeners contacted the radio station asking for more of " the singing kid " that the producers hired him to host his own 15 @-@ minute show twice a week for a weekly salary of US $ 15 ( equivalent to US $ 246 @.@ 90 in 2016 ) . 
 In August 1938 , Elonzo Williams was temporarily released from the hospital . He showed up unannounced at the family 's home in Montgomery . Lillie was unwilling to let him reclaim his position at the head of the household , so he stayed only long enough to celebrate Williams ' birthday in September before he returned to the medical center in Louisiana . 
 Williams ' successful radio show fueled his entry into a music career . His salary was enough for him to start his own band , which he dubbed the Drifting Cowboys . The original members were guitarist Braxton <unk> , fiddler Freddie Beach , and comedian Smith " <unk> " Adair . James E. ( Jimmy ) Porter was the youngest , being only 13 when he started playing steel guitar for Williams . Arthur Whiting was also a guitarist for The Drifting Cowboys . The band traveled throughout central and southern Alabama performing in clubs and at private parties . James Ellis Garner later played fiddle for him . Lillie Williams became the Drifting Cowboys ' manager . Williams dropped out of school in October 1939 so that the Drifting Cowboys could work full @-@ time . Lillie Williams began booking show dates , negotiating prices and driving them to some of their shows . Now free to travel without Williams ' schooling taking precedence , the band could tour as far away as western Georgia and the Florida Panhandle . The band started to play in theaters before the start of the movies and later in honky @-@ tonks . Williams ' alcohol problem started during the tours , on occasion spending an important part of the show revenues . Meanwhile , between tour schedules , Williams returned to Montgomery to host his radio show . 
 = = = 1940s = = = 
 The American entry into World War II in 1941 marked the beginning of hard times for Williams . All his band members were drafted to serve in the military , while he got a 4 @-@ F deferment from the military draft after falling from a bull during a rodeo in Texas . Many of their replacements refused to continue playing in the band because of Williams ' worsening alcoholism . He continued to show up for his radio show intoxicated , so in August 1942 radio station WSFA fired him for " habitual drunkenness . " During one of his concerts Williams met backstage his idol , Grand Ole Opry star Roy Acuff , who later warned him of the dangers of alcohol , saying , " You 've got a million @-@ dollar talent , son , but a ten @-@ cent brain . " 
 He worked for the rest of the war in a shipbuilding company in Mobile , Alabama , as well as singing in bars for soldiers . In 1943 Williams met Audrey Sheppard on a medicine show in Banks , Alabama . Williams and Sheppard lived and worked together in Mobile , Sheppard later told Williams that she wanted to move to Montgomery with him and start a band together and help him regain his radio show . The couple were married in 1944 in a Texaco Station in Andalusia , Alabama , by a justice of the peace . The marriage was declared illegal , since Sheppard 's divorce from her previous husband did not comply with the legally required sixty @-@ day trial reconciliation . 
 In 1945 , when he was back in Montgomery , Williams started to perform again for radio station WSFA . He wrote songs weekly to perform during the shows . As a result of the new variety of his repertoire , Williams published his first song book , Original Songs of Hank Williams . The book only listed lyrics , since its main purpose was to attract more audience . It included ten songs : " Mother Is Gone " , " Won 't You Please Come Back " , " My Darling Baby Girl " ( with Audrey Sheppard ) , " <unk> 's Musket " , " I Just Wish I Could Forget " , " Let 's Turn Back the Years " , " <unk> @-@ <unk> " , " I Loved No One But You " , " A Tramp on the Street " , and " You 'll Love Me Again " . Williams became recognized as a songwriter , Sheppard became his manager and occasionally accompanied him on duets in some of his live concerts . 
 On September 14 , 1946 , Williams auditioned for Nashville 's Grand Ole Opry but was rejected . After the failure of his audition , Williams and Audrey Sheppard tried to interest the recently formed music publishing firm Acuff @-@ Rose Music . Williams and his wife approached Fred Rose , the president of the company , during one of his habitual ping @-@ pong games at WSM radio studios . Audrey Williams asked Rose if her husband could sing a song for him on that moment , Rose agreed , and he liked Williams ' musical style . Rose signed Williams to a six song contract , and leveraged this deal to sign Williams with Sterling Records . On December 11 , 1946 , in his first recording session , he recorded " Wealth Won 't Save Your Soul " , " Calling You " , " Never Again ( Will I Knock on Your Door ) " , and " When God Comes and Gathers His Jewels " . The recordings " Never Again " and " Honky Tonkin ' " became successful , and earned Williams the attention of MGM Records . 
 Williams signed with MGM Records in 1947 and released " Move It on Over " , which became a massive country hit . In 1948 he moved to Shreveport , Louisiana , and he joined the Louisiana Hayride , a radio show broadcast that propelled him into living rooms all over the southeast appearing on weekend shows . Williams eventually started to host a show on KWKH and started touring across western Louisiana and eastern Texas , always returning on Saturdays for the weekly broadcast of the Hayride . After a few more moderate hits , in 1949 he released his version of the 1922 Cliff Friend & Irving Mills song " Lovesick Blues " , made popular by Rex Griffin . Williams ' version became a huge country hit ; the song stayed at number one on the Billboard charts over four consecutive months , crossing over to mainstream audiences and gaining Williams a place in the Grand Ole Opry . On June 11 , 1949 , Williams made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry , where he became the first performer to receive six encores . He brought together Bob McNett ( guitar ) , <unk> <unk> ( bass ) , Jerry Rivers ( fiddle ) and Don Helms ( steel guitar ) to form the most famous version of the Drifting Cowboys , earning an estimated US $ 1 @,@ 000 per show ( equivalent to US $ 9 @,@ 945 @.@ 5 in 2016 ) . That year Audrey Williams gave birth to Randall Hank Williams ( Hank Williams , Jr . ) . During 1949 , he joined the first European tour of the Grand Ole Opry , performing in military bases in England , Germany and Azores . Williams released seven hit songs after " Lovesick Blues " , including " Wedding Bells " , " Mind Your Own Business " , " You 're Gonna Change ( Or I 'm Gonna Leave ) " , and " My Bucket 's Got a Hole in It " . 
 = = = 1950s = = = 
 In 1950 , Williams began recording as " Luke the Drifter " for his religious @-@ themed recordings , many of which are recitations rather than singing . Fearful that disc jockeys and jukebox operators would hesitate to accept these unusual recordings , Williams used this alias to avoid hurting the marketability of his name . Although the real identity of Luke the Drifter was supposed to be anonymous , Williams often performed part of the material of the recordings on stage . Most of the material was written by Williams , in cases with the help of Fred Rose and his son Wesley . The songs depicted Luke the Drifter traveling around from place to place , narrating stories from different characters and philosophizing about life . Some of the compositions were accompanied by a pipe organ . 
 Around this time Williams released more hit songs , such as " My Son Calls Another Man Daddy " , " They 'll Never Take Her Love from Me " , " Why Should We Try Anymore " , " Nobody 's Lonesome for Me " , " Long Gone Lonesome Blues " , " Why Don 't You Love Me " , " Moanin ' the Blues " , and " I Just Don 't Like This Kind of Living " . In 1951 " Dear John " became a hit , but it was the flip side , " Cold , Cold Heart " , that became one of his most @-@ recognized songs . A pop cover version by Tony Bennett released the same year stayed on the charts for 27 weeks , peaking at number one . 
 Hank 's career reached a peak in August – September 1951 with his <unk> tour of the U.S. with actor Bob Hope and other luminaries . During the tour , Hank was photographed signing a motion picture deal with MGM . In October Hank recorded a demo , " There 's a Tear in My Beer " for a friend , " Big Bill Lister " , who recorded it in the studio . On November 14 , 1951 Hank flew to New York with his steel guitar player Don Helms where he appeared on television for the first time on " The Perry Como Show . " There he and Perry sang " Hey Good Lookin ' . " Photos but no existing footage remain of his appearance . 
 In November 1951 Hank suffered a fall during a hunting trip with his fiddler Jerry Rivers in Franklin , Tennessee . The fall reactivated his old back pains . He later started to consume painkillers , including morphine , and alcohol to ease the pain . On May 21 , he had been admitted to North Louisiana Sanitarium for the treatment of his alcoholism , leaving on May 24 . On December 13 , 1951 he had a spinal fusion at the Vanderbilt University Hospital , being released on December 24 . He lived during his recovery with his mother in Montgomery , and later moved to Nashville with Ray Price . 
 During March and April 1952 Hank flew to New York with steel guitarist Don Helms , where he made two appearances with other Grand Ole Opry members on " The Kate Smith Show . " He sang " Cold , Cold Heart , " " Hey Good Lookin ' , " " Glory Bound Train " with other cast members , and a duet , " I Can 't Help It if I 'm Still in Love with You " with Anita Carter . Footage remains of this appearance . That spring he had a brief affair with dancer Bobbi Jett , with whom he fathered a daughter , Jett Williams ( born January 6 , 1953 , two days after his interment ) . 
 In June 1952 , he recorded " Jambalaya , " " Window Shopping , " " Settin ' the Woods on Fire , " and " I 'll Never Get out of this World Alive . " In early July , Audrey Williams divorced Hank . The next day he recorded " You Win Again " and " I Won 't be Home No More . " About this time he met Billie Jean Jones , a girlfriend of country singer Faron Young , at the Grand Ole Opry . As a girl , Billy had lived down the street from Hank when he was with the Louisiana Hayride , and now Hank began to visit her frequently in Shreveport , causing him to miss many Grand Ole Opry appearances . 
 On August 11 , 1952 , Williams was dismissed from the Grand Ole Opry for habitual drunkenness and missing shows . He returned to Shreveport , Louisiana to perform in KWKH and <unk> shows and in the Louisiana Hayride , for which he toured again . His performances were acclaimed when he was sober , but despite the efforts of his work associates to get him to shows sober , his abuse of alcohol resulted in occasions when he did not appear or his performances were poor . In October 1952 he married Billie Jean Jones . 
 During his last recording session on September 23 , 1952 , Williams recorded " Kaw @-@ Liga , " along with " Your Cheatin ' Heart , " " Take These Chains from My Heart , " and " I Could Never be Ashamed of You . " Due to Williams ' excesses , Fred Rose stopped working with him . By the end of 1952 , Williams had started to suffer heart problems . He met Horace " Toby " Marshall in Oklahoma City , who said that he was a doctor . Marshall had been previously convicted for forgery , and had been paroled and released from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in 1951 . Among other fake titles he said that he was a Doctor of Science . He purchased the DSC title for $ 35 from the Chicago School of Applied Science ; in the diploma , he requested that the DSC be spelled out as " Doctor of Science and Psychology " . Under the name of Dr. C. W. Lemon he prescribed Williams with amphetamines , Seconal , chloral hydrate , and morphine .

 Williams was scheduled to perform at the Municipal Auditorium in Charleston , West Virginia on Wednesday December 31 , 1952 . Advance ticket sales totaled US $ 3 @,@ 500 . That day , because of an ice storm in the Nashville area , Williams could not fly , so he hired a college student , Charles Carr , to drive him to the concerts . Carr called the Charleston auditorium from Knoxville to say that Williams would not arrive on time owing to the ice storm and was ordered to drive Williams to Canton , Ohio , for the New Year 's Day concert there . 
 They arrived at the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville , Tennessee , where Carr requested a doctor for Williams , as he was feeling the combination of the chloral hydrate and alcohol he had drunk on the way from Montgomery to Knoxville . Dr. <unk> Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter @-@ grain of morphine . Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel ; the porters had to carry Williams to the car , as he was coughing and hiccuping . At around midnight on Thursday January 1 , 1953 , when they crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol , Virginia , Carr stopped at a small all @-@ night restaurant and asked Williams if he wanted to eat . Williams said he did not , and those are believed to be his last words . Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in Oak Hill , West Virginia , where he realized that Williams was dead . The filling station 's owner called the chief of the local police . In Williams ' Cadillac the police found some empty beer cans and unfinished handwritten lyrics . 
 Dr. Ivan Malinin performed the autopsy at the Tyree Funeral House . Malinin found hemorrhages in the heart and neck and pronounced the cause of death as " insufficiency of the right ventricle of the heart " . That evening , when the announcer at Canton announced Williams ' death to the gathered crowd , they started laughing , thinking that it was just another excuse . After Hawkshaw Hawkins and other performers started singing " I Saw the Light " as a tribute to Williams , the crowd , now realizing that he was indeed dead , sang along . Dr. Malinin also wrote that Williams had been severely beaten and kicked in the groin recently . Also local magistrate Virgil F. Lyons ordered an inquest into Williams ' death concerning the <unk> that was visible on his head . 
 His body was transported to Montgomery , Alabama , on Friday January 2 and placed in a silver coffin that was first shown at his mother 's boarding house for two days . His funeral took place on Sunday January 4 at the Montgomery Auditorium , with his coffin placed on the flower @-@ covered stage . An estimated 15 @,@ 000 to 25 @,@ 000 people passed by the silver coffin , and the auditorium was filled with 2 @,@ 750 mourners . His funeral was said to have been far larger than any ever held for any other citizen of Alabama and the largest event ever held in Montgomery . Williams ' remains are interred at the Oakwood Annex in Montgomery . The president of MGM told Billboard magazine that the company got only about five requests for pictures of Williams during the weeks before his death , but over three hundred afterwards . The local record shops sold out of all of their records , and customers were asking for all records ever released by Williams . His final single , released in November 1952 while he was still alive , was titled " I 'll Never Get Out of This World Alive " . " Your Cheatin ' Heart " was written and recorded in September 1952 but released in late January 1953 after Williams ' death . The song , backed by " Kaw @-@ Liga , " was number one on the country charts for six weeks . It provided the title for the 1964 biographical film of the same name , which starred George Hamilton . " Take These Chains From My Heart " was released in April 1953 and went to # 1 on the country charts . " I Won 't Be Home No More , " released in July , went to # 3 , and an overdubbed demo , " Weary Blues From Waitin , ' " written with Ray Price , went to # 7 .

 On December 15 , 1944 , Williams married Audrey Sheppard . It was her second marriage and his first . Their son , Randall Hank Williams , who would achieve fame in his own right as Hank Williams , Jr . , was born on May 26 , 1949 . The marriage , always turbulent , rapidly disintegrated , and Williams developed a serious problem with alcohol , morphine , and other painkillers prescribed for him to ease the severe back pain caused by his spina bifida . The couple divorced on May 29 , 1952 . 
 In June 1952 , Williams moved in with his mother , even as he released numerous hit songs , such as " Half as Much " in April , " Jambalaya ( On the Bayou ) " in July , " Settin ' the Woods on Fire " / " You Win Again " in September , and " I 'll Never Get Out of This World Alive " in November . His drug problems continued to spiral out of control as he moved to Nashville and officially divorced his wife . A relationship with a woman named Bobbie Jett during this period resulted in a daughter , Jett Williams , who was born five days after Williams ' death . His mother adopted Jett , who was made a ward of the state and then adopted by another couple after her grandmother died . Jett Williams did not learn that she was Hank Williams ' daughter until the early 1980s . 
 On October 18 , 1952 , Williams and Billie Jean Jones Eshlimar were married in Minden , Louisiana by a justice of the peace . It was the second marriage for both ( both being divorced with children ) . The next day two public ceremonies were also held at the New Orleans Civic Auditorium , where 14 @,@ 000 seats were sold for each . After Williams ' death , a judge ruled that the wedding was not legal because Jones Eshlimar 's divorce had not become final until eleven days after she married Williams . Williams ' first wife , Audrey , and his mother , Lillie Williams , were the driving forces behind having the marriage declared invalid and pursued the matter for years . Williams had also married Audrey Sheppard before her divorce was final , on the tenth day of a required sixty @-@ day reconciliation period . 
 Williams was a lifelong Republican and was a vocal supporter of Dwight D. Eisenhower . According to singer Jo Stafford , he sent Eisenhower a telegram on his birthday prior to the 1952 presidential election informing him that Williams considered it a personal honor to endorse a military figure to lead the nation in its coming future .

 After Williams ' death , Audrey Williams filed a suit in Nashville against MGM Records and Acuff @-@ Rose . The suit demanded that both of the publishing companies continue to pay her half of the royalties from Hank Williams ' records . Williams had an agreement giving his first wife half of the royalties , but allegedly there was no clarification that the deal was valid after his death . Because Williams may have left no will , the disposition of the other fifty percent was considered uncertain ; those involved included the second Mrs. Williams and her daughter and Hank Williams ' mother and sister . On October 22 , 1975 , a federal judge in Atlanta , Georgia , finally ruled Jones Eshlimar 's marriage was valid and that half of Williams ' future royalties belonged to her .

 Stakes was announced in February 2015 alongside news of Long Live the Royals , a separate miniseries created by Sean <unk> , at an upfront regarding Cartoon Network 's programming for the 2015 to 2016 television season . Writing for Cartoon Brew , Amid Amidi speculated that both were commissioned following the success of Over the Garden Wall , the network 's first miniseries created by Patrick McHale ( a former writer for Adventure Time ) . Michael <unk> , the chief marketing officer of the network , later said that " miniseries provide the network with more opportunities to try different creative textures and give new properties a chance to get on air . " Despite being touted by some outlets as a " spin @-@ off " , Adventure Time showrunner Adam Muto later clarified that Stakes would air as part of the series ' seventh season . 
 At the 2015 New York Comic Con , Muto revealed that the miniseries originated with ideas that were initially developed during the show 's second season . He remarked , " There was this idea from season two about Marceline and ... how she got her powers to begin with . We kind of rolled with that and expanded that into eight episodes . " When Olivia Olson — the voice actress who plays Marceline — was informed that the show would be making an eight @-@ part series about her character , she reportedly cried because she was so excited . Due to the Marceline @-@ centric nature of the miniseries , a new opening was created that features Olson singing the theme song . This intro was storyboarded by Tom Herpich and animated by Masaaki Yuasa 's company Science <unk> . 
 The miniseries ' story was developed by head writer Kent Osborne , series creator Pendleton Ward , Jack Pendarvis , and Muto . The eight episodes were storyboarded by Ako Castuera , Jesse Moynihan , Muto , Hanna K. Nyström , Herpich , Seo Kim , Somvilay Xayaphone , Emily Partridge , and Luke Pearson . Andres Salaff , Elizabeth Ito , and Muto served as the miniseries ' supervising directors . Notably , the miniseries saw the return of several artists who had previously left the series , like Castuera ( a storyboard artist who had left the series after storyboarding the fifth season finale " Billy 's Bucket List " ) , and Rebecca Sugar ( a storyboard artist and songwriter , who had left the series after storyboarding the fifth season episode " Simon & Marcy " ) . Castuera storyboarded the first , sixth , and seventh parts of Stakes alongside Moynihan , and Sugar wrote a new song for the miniseries entitled " Everything Stays " and voiced Marceline 's mother . 
 In regards to the miniseries ' song " Everything Stays " , Nyström revealed that , during the storyboarding of the episode of the same name , she found herself unable to write a lullaby for the scene between Marceline and her mother . She relayed her issue to Muto , who contacted Sugar and asked if she would be willing to pen the song . Sugar agreed and based the song on an incident in which she lost a stuffed animal in a garden . A year later , she found it ; the sun had bleached the exposed surfaces , but the underside was still the same . She explained , " [ The stuffed animal ] wasn ’ t better , or worse , just different . It was the first time I realized that things will change no matter what , even if they ’ re left alone , and stay completely still . " Muto was excited to have Sugar return to work on the show , and noted at the 2015 Adventure Time San Diego Comic @-@ Con International panel that " because [ Stakes ] was a Marceline miniseries , it wouldn 't really feel complete unless Rebecca Sugar wrote a song for it . " 
 Ghostshrimp , a background artist who worked on the series during seasons one through four , also returned to draw around 70 background pieces for this miniseries . Ghostshrimp , who had left the series during the middle of season four , noted : " I was super pumped that they wanted me to work on it , [ and ] it was great to return to that world for another go around . "

 The miniseries features vocal performances courtesy of the show 's regular crew : Jeremy Shada ( who voices Finn the Human ) , John DiMaggio ( who portrays Jake the Dog ) , Olivia Olson ( who portrays Marceline ) , Tom Kenny ( who lends his voice to the Ice King ) , Hynden Walch ( who voices Princess Bubblegum ) , Steve Little ( who plays Peppermint Butler ) , and Pendleton Ward ( who voices Lumpy Space Princess ) . The Adventure Time cast records their lines together in group recordings as opposed to different recording sessions with each voice actor . This is to record more natural sounding dialogue among the characters . Hynden Walch has described these group recordings as akin to " doing a play reading — a really , really out there play . " 
 The miniseries also features several guest actors lending their voices to various characters . Sugar , in addition to her role as songwriter , was also brought on board to voice Marceline 's mother ; this role marks her first foray into voice acting . Other guest stars include Rebecca Romijn as Empress Eyes , Billy Brown as the Vampire King , Paul Williams as the Hierophant , Ron Funches as the Fool , Beau Billingslea as the Moon , Kyle Kinane as Cloud Dance , and Ava Acres as Young Marceline and the rabbit @-@ hatted child .

 Stakes was met with mostly positive reviews , although a few commentators felt that the miniseries did not meet expectations . Charlie Jane Anders of io9 applauded the miniseries , noting that it 's an interesting meditation of the concept of change , as well as the philosophical idea that everything is cyclical . In regards to the art and direction of the miniseries , Anders wrote : " There is so much insane gorgeous imagery in this [ miniseries ] , including a ton of really fantastic dream sequences . This show is really pushing its limits in terms of pure visual artistry . " Anders noted that , while some fans of the show have been suffering from " Adventure Time fatigue " — largely based on the belief that the show has not moved forward since Finn met his father — Stakes " really feels like a rejoinder to the people who complain the show isn ’ t moving fast enough with its plots " . Writing for Vox , Todd VanDerWerff wrote highly of the miniseries , arguing that it was an excellent example of the coming @-@ of @-@ age story that " shows off the kids series ' emotional maturity " . He did note that the miniseries is " less a cohesive whole than a bunch of short stories that feel as if they accidentally add up to something bigger " , and that the need for every installment to exist as a self @-@ contained unit made Stakes " a little clunky " . With that being said , he felt that it ended up being " suitably epic " and " rich with metaphor " . Ultimately , VanDerWerff felt that the moral message of the miniseries was : " Change is good . Growth is good . Supporting others ' growth is good . And accepting others when they need to change is the best thing you can do . " 
 Heather Hogan of <unk> lauded the miniseries for " color [ ing ] in some of Marceline 's past , answer [ ing ] lots of questions about her relationship with Bonnie , and <unk> [ ing ] her a richer future . " She argued that the miniseries as a whole was a commentary on depression , and that at the conclusion of Stakes , while Marceline had not vanquished depression , " fighting it helped her grow . " Brandon Russell of TechnoBuffalo wrote , " The miniseries does an excellent job of exploring themes of depression , change , and forgiveness . " Russell praised the miniseries for showing Marceline 's emotional transformation , noting that Marceline 's momentary depression in " The Dark Cloud " at the futility of her plight is " a reminder that , although change is hard , it 's necessary for growth . " However , Russell critiqued the fact that , due to the individual episodes ' lengths , some of the miniseries ' more poignant material was not explored to its full extent . 
 Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the miniseries a " B " , noting that the event " loses steam when it moves away from the introspective personal elements of the past to detail Marceline and her friends ' vampire hunting adventure in the present . " He also bemoaned the fact that only " Everything Stays " features flashbacks , arguing that " rushing through those past events is a missed opportunity to offer a more comprehensive look at where Marceline comes from and how those circumstances have shaped her " . With that being said , Sava was highly complimentary towards the voice acting , with praise being directed towards Olson and the actors who voice the villains ; Sava wrote , " The new characters ' personalities are quickly solidified by the guest stars ' expressive performances . " Eric Thurm of Pitchfork Media opined that Stakes " includes all sorts of cool action sequences and , best of all , it focuses on the backstory of the show 's most musical character : Marceline [ ... ] But Stakes , as fun as it is , ultimately fails to fully deliver , mostly because of a lack of , um , stakes . " 
 Sugar 's " Everything Stays " was met with critical praise . VanDerWerff described it as " beautiful " . Russell argued that it is " arguably the most beautiful and poignant song in the Adventure Time canon . " Sava called it " poignant " , noting that " Olson brings a mournful quality to the song when Marceline reprises it later , and the combination of her somber vocals with Sugar 's delicate songwriting gives the song a quiet power that highlights the importance of this melody in Marceline 's story . " Likewise , Thurm called it the " most exciting moment " in the miniseries and that the song " is pretty much a perfect Adventure Time song . It 's quiet , beautiful , and heartfelt — a lullaby for children at heart , no matter their age . "

 = George Rogers Clark = 
 George Rogers Clark ( November 19 , 1752 – February 13 , 1818 ) was a surveyor , soldier , and militia officer from Virginia and the highest ranking American military officer on the northwestern frontier during the American Revolutionary War . He served as leader of the Kentucky ( then part of Virginia ) militia throughout much of the war . Clark is best known for his celebrated captures of Kaskaskia ( 1778 ) and Vincennes ( 1779 ) during the Illinois Campaign , which greatly weakened British influence in the Northwest Territory . Because the British ceded the entire Northwest Territory to the United States in the 1783 Treaty of Paris , Clark has often been hailed as the " Conqueror of the Old Northwest " . 
 Clark 's military achievements all came before his 30th birthday . Afterwards he led militia in the opening engagements of the Northwest Indian War , but was accused of being drunk on duty . Despite his demand for a formal investigation into the accusations , he was disgraced and forced to resign . He left Kentucky to live on the Indiana frontier . Never fully reimbursed by Virginia for his wartime expenditures , Clark spent the final decades of his life evading creditors , and living in increasing poverty and obscurity . He was involved in two failed conspiracies to open the Spanish @-@ controlled Mississippi River to American traffic . After suffering a stroke and the loss of his leg , Clark was aided in his final years by family members , including his younger brother William , one of the leaders of the Lewis and Clark Expedition . Clark died of a stroke on February 13 , 1818 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 George Rogers Clark was born on November 19 , 1752 in Charlottesville , Virginia , near the home of Thomas Jefferson . He was the second of ten children of John Clark and Ann Rogers Clark , who were Anglicans of English and Scots ancestry . Five of their six sons became officers during the American Revolutionary War . Their youngest son , William Clark , was too young to fight in the Revolution , but later became famous as a leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition . In about 1756 , after the outbreak of the French and Indian War ( part of the worldwide Seven Years ' War ) , the family moved away from the frontier to Caroline County , Virginia , and lived on a 400 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 6 km2 ) plantation that later grew to over 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 8 @.@ 1 km2 ) . 
 Little is known of Clark 's schooling . He lived with his grandfather so he could attend Donald Robertson 's school with James Madison and John Taylor of Caroline and received a common education . He was also tutored at home , as was usual for Virginian planters ' children of the period . Becoming a planter , he was taught to survey land by his grandfather . 
 At age nineteen , Clark left his home on his first surveying trip into western Virginia . In 1772 , as a twenty @-@ year @-@ old surveyor , Clark made his first trip into Kentucky via the Ohio River at Pittsburgh . Thousands of settlers were entering the area as a result of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768 . In 1774 , Clark was preparing to lead an expedition of ninety men down the Ohio River when war broke out with the American Indians . Although most of Kentucky was not inhabited by Indians , several tribes used the area for hunting . The tribes living in the Ohio country had not been party to the treaty signed with the Cherokee , which ceded the Kentucky hunting grounds to Britain for settlement . They attacked the European @-@ American settlers to try to push them out of the area , conflicts that eventually culminated in Lord Dunmore 's War . Clark served in the war as a captain in the Virginia militia . 
 = = Revolutionary War = = 
 As the American Revolutionary War began in the East , settlers in Kentucky were involved in a dispute over the region 's sovereignty . Richard Henderson , a judge and land speculator from North Carolina , had purchased much of Kentucky from the Cherokee in an illegal treaty . Henderson intended to create a proprietary colony known as Transylvania , but many Kentucky settlers did not recognize Transylvania 's authority over them . In June 1776 , these settlers selected Clark and John Gabriel Jones to deliver a petition to the Virginia General Assembly , asking Virginia to formally extend its boundaries to include Kentucky . Clark and Jones traveled via the Wilderness Road to Williamsburg , where they convinced Governor Patrick Henry to create Kentucky County , Virginia . Clark was given 500 lb ( 230 kg ) of gunpowder to help defend the settlements and was appointed a major in the Kentucky County militia . Clark was just 24 years old , but older settlers such as Daniel Boone , Benjamin Logan , and Leonard Helm looked to him as a leader . 
 = = = Illinois campaign = = = 
 In 1777 , the American Revolutionary War intensified in Kentucky . Armed and encouraged by British lieutenant governor Henry Hamilton at Fort Detroit , Native Americans waged war and raided the Kentucky settlers in hopes of reclaiming the region as their hunting ground . The Continental Army could spare no men for an invasion of the Northwest or the defense of distant Kentucky , so its defense was left entirely to the local population . Clark participated in several skirmishes against the Native American raiders . As a leader of the defense of Kentucky , Clark believed that the best way to end these raids was to seize British outposts north of the Ohio River , thereby destroying British influence with the Indians . Clark asked Governor Patrick Henry of Virginia for permission to lead a secret expedition to capture the nearest British posts , which were located in the Illinois country . Governor Henry commissioned Clark as a lieutenant colonel in the Virginia militia and authorized him to raise troops for the expedition . 
 In July 1778 , Clark and about 175 men crossed the Ohio River at Fort Massac and marched to Kaskaskia , taking it on the night of July 4 . Cahokia , Vincennes , and several other villages and forts in British territory were subsequently captured without firing a shot , because most of the French @-@ speaking and American Indian inhabitants were unwilling to take up arms on behalf of the British . To counter Clark 's advance , Henry Hamilton reoccupied Vincennes with a small force . In February 1779 , Clark returned to Vincennes in a surprise winter expedition and retook the town , capturing Hamilton in the process . The winter expedition was Clark 's most significant military achievement and became the source of his reputation as an early American military hero . When news of his victory reached General George Washington , Clark 's success was celebrated and was used to encourage the alliance with France . Washington recognized his achievement had been gained without support from the regular army in men or funds . Virginia capitalized on Clark 's success by laying claim to the whole of the Old Northwest , calling it Illinois County . 
 = = = Final years of the war = = = 
 Clark 's ultimate goal during the Revolutionary War was to seize British @-@ held Detroit , but he could never recruit enough men to make the attempt . The Kentucky militiamen generally preferred to defend their homes by staying closer to Kentucky rather than making a long and potentially perilous expedition to Detroit . In June 1780 , a mixed force of British and Indians , including Shawnee , Delaware , Wyandot and others , from Detroit invaded Kentucky with cannons , capturing two fortified settlements and carrying away hundreds of prisoners . In August 1780 , Clark led a retaliatory force that won a victory at the Shawnee village of <unk> , at what is now called George Rogers Clark Park near Springfield , Ohio . 
 The next year Clark was promoted to brigadier general by Governor Thomas Jefferson , and was given command of all the militia in the Kentucky and Illinois counties . He prepared again to lead an expedition against Detroit . Although Washington transferred a small group of regulars to assist Clark , the detachment was disastrously defeated in August 1781 before they could meet up with Clark , ending the campaign . 
 In August 1782 , another British @-@ Indian force defeated the Kentucky militia at the Battle of Blue Licks . Although Clark had not been present at the battle , as senior military officer , he was severely criticized in the Virginia Council for the disaster . In response , Clark led another expedition into the Ohio country , destroying several Indian towns along the Great Miami River in the last major expedition of the war . 
 The importance of Clark 's activities in the Revolutionary War has been the subject of much debate among historians . As early as 1779 he was called the Conqueror of the Northwest by George Mason . Because the British ceded the entire Old Northwest Territory to the United States in the 1783 Treaty of Paris , some historians , including William Hayden English , credit Clark with nearly doubling the size of the original Thirteen Colonies by seizing control of the Illinois country during the war . Clark 's Illinois campaign — particularly the surprise march to Vincennes — was greatly celebrated and romanticized . Other historians , such as Lowell Harrison , have downplayed the importance of the campaign in the peace negotiations and the outcome of the war , arguing that Clark 's " conquest " was little more than a temporary occupation . 
 = = Later years = = 
 Clark was just thirty years old when the Revolutionary War ended , but his greatest military achievements were already behind him . Ever since Clark 's victories in Illinois , settlers had been pouring into Kentucky , often illegally squatting on Indian land north of the Ohio River . From 1784 until 1788 Clark served as the superintendent @-@ surveyor for Virginia 's war veterans and surveyed the lands granted to them for their service in the war . The position brought a small income , but Clark devoted very little time to the enterprise . Clark helped to negotiate the Treaty of Fort McIntosh in 1785 and the Treaty of Fort Finney in 1786 with tribes north of the river , but violence between Native Americans and Kentucky settlers continued to escalate . 
 According to a 1790 U.S. government report , 1 @,@ 500 Kentucky settlers had been killed in Indian raids since the end of the Revolutionary War . In an attempt to end these raids , Clark led an expedition of 1 @,@ 200 drafted men against Indian towns on the Wabash River in 1786 , one of the first actions of the Northwest Indian War . The campaign ended without a victory : lacking supplies , about three hundred militiamen mutinied , and Clark had to withdraw , but not before concluding a ceasefire with the Indians . It was rumored , most notably by James Wilkinson , that Clark had often been drunk on duty . When Clark learned of the rumors he demanded an official inquiry be made , but his request was declined by Governor of Virginia , and Virginia Council condemned Clark 's actions . Clark 's reputation was tarnished , he never again led men in battle , and he left Kentucky , moving into the Indiana frontier near Clarksville 
 = = = Life in Indiana = = = 
 Clark lived most of the rest of his life in financial difficulties . Clark had financed the majority of his military campaigns with borrowed funds . When creditors began to come to him for these unpaid debts , he was unable to obtain recompense from Virginia or the United States Congress because record keeping on the frontier during the war had been haphazard . For his services in the war Virginia gave Clark a gift of 150 @,@ 000 acres ( 610 km2 ) of land . The soldiers who fought with Clark also received smaller tracts of land . Together with Clark 's Grant and his other holdings , his ownership encompassed all of present @-@ day Clark County , Indiana and most of the surrounding counties . Although Clark had claims to tens of thousands of acres of land resulting from his military service and land speculation , he was " land @-@ poor " , meaning that he owned much land but lacked the means to make money from it . 
 With his career seemingly over and his prospects for prosperity doubtful , on February 2 , 1793 , Clark offered his services to Edmond @-@ Charles Genêt , the controversial ambassador of revolutionary France , hoping to earn money to maintain his estate . Western Americans were outraged that the Spanish , who controlled Louisiana , denied Americans free access to the Mississippi River , their only easy outlet for long distance commerce . The Washington Administration was also seemingly deaf to western concerns about opening the Mississippi to U.S. commerce . Clark proposed to Genêt that , with French financial support , he could lead an expedition to drive the Spanish out of the Mississippi Valley . Genêt appointed Clark " Major General in the Armies of France and Commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the French Revolutionary Legion on the Mississippi River " . Clark began to organize a campaign to seize New Madrid , St. Louis , Natchez , and New Orleans , getting assistance from old comrades such as Benjamin Logan and John Montgomery , and winning the tacit support of Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby . Clark spent $ 4 @,@ 680 ( $ 59 @,@ 161 in 2009 chained dollars ) of his own money for supplies . In early 1794 , however , President Washington issued a proclamation forbidding Americans from violating U.S. neutrality and threatened to dispatch General Anthony Wayne to Fort Massac to stop the expedition . The French government recalled Genêt and revoked the commissions he granted to the Americans for the war against Spain . Clark 's planned campaign gradually collapsed , and he was unable to convince the French to reimburse him for his expenses . 
 Due to his growing debt , it became impossible for Clark to continue holding his land , since it became subject to seizure . Much of his land he deeded to friends or transferred to family members where it could be held for him , so that it would not be lost to his creditors . After a few years , the lenders and their assignees closed in and deprived the veteran of almost all of the property that remained in his name . Clark , once the largest landholder in the Northwest Territory , was left with only a small plot of land in Clarksville , where he built a small gristmill which he worked with two African American slaves . Clark lived on for another two decades , and continued to struggle with alcohol abuse , a problem which had plagued him on @-@ and @-@ off for many years . He was very bitter about his treatment and neglect by Virginia , and blamed his misfortune on the state . 
 The Indiana Territory chartered the Indiana Canal Company in 1805 to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio , near Clarksville . Clark was named to the board of directors and was part of the surveying team that assisted in laying out the route of the canal . The company collapsed the next year before construction could begin , when two of the fellow board members , including Vice President Aaron Burr , were arrested for treason . A large part of the company 's $ 1 @.@ 2 million ( $ 60 @.@ 5 million in 2009 chained dollars ) in investments was unaccounted for , and where the funds went was never determined . 
 = = = Return to Kentucky = = = 
 In 1809 Clark suffered a severe stroke . Falling into an operating fireplace , he suffered a burn on one leg so severe as to necessitate the amputation of the limb . It was impossible for Clark to continue to operate his mill , so he became a dependent member of the household of his brother @-@ in @-@ law , Major William Croghan , a planter at Locust Grove farm eight miles ( 13 km ) from the growing town of Louisville . During 1812 , the Virginia General Assembly granted Clark a pension of four hundred dollars per year , and finally recognized his services in the Revolution by granting him a ceremonial sword . After a second stroke , Clark died at Locust Grove , February 13 , 1818 , and was buried at Locust Grove Cemetery two days later . 
 In his funeral oration , Judge John Rowan succinctly summed up the stature and importance of George Rogers Clark during the critical years on the Trans @-@ Appalachian frontier : " The mighty oak of the forest has fallen , and now the scrub oaks sprout all around . " 
 Clark 's body was exhumed along with the rest of his family members on October 29 , 1869 , and reburied at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville . 
 Several years after Clark 's death the state of Virginia granted his estate $ 30 @,@ 000 ( $ 568 @,@ 853 in 2009 chained dollars ) as a partial payment on the debts that they owed him . The government of Virginia continued to find debt to Clark for decades , with the last payment to his estate being made in 1913 . Clark never married and he kept no account of any romantic relationships , although his family held that he had once been in love with Teresa de Leyba , sister of Don Fernando de Leyba , the Lieutenant Governor of Spanish Louisiana . Writings from his niece and cousin in the Draper Manuscripts attest to their belief in Clark 's lifelong disappointment over the failed romance .

 On May 23 , 1928 , President Calvin Coolidge ordered a memorial to George Rogers Clark to be erected in Vincennes . Completed in 1933 , the George Rogers Clark Memorial , built in Roman Classical style , stands on what was then believed to be the site of Fort Sackville , and is now the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park . It includes a statue of Clark by Hermon Atkins MacNeil . On February 25 , 1929 , to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the surrender of Fort Sackville , the U.S. Post Office Department issued a 2 @-@ cent postage stamp that depicted the surrender . In April 1929 , the Paul Revere Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution of Muncie , Indiana erected a monument to George Rogers Clark on Washington Avenue in Fredericksburg , Virginia . The marker doesn 't identify the connection between General Clark and Fredericksburg , so this choice of location is currently a mystery . In 1975 , the Indiana General Assembly designated February 25 George Rogers Clark Day in Indiana . Built in 1929 , the George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge ( Second Street Bridge ) carries U.S. Highway 31 , over the Ohio River at Louisville , Kentucky .

 = Superunknown = 
 Superunknown is the fourth album by American rock band Soundgarden , released on March 8 , 1994 through A & M Records . It is the band 's second album with bassist Ben Shepherd , and features new producer Michael Beinhorn . Soundgarden began work on the album after touring in support of its previous album , Badmotorfinger ( 1991 ) . Superunknown continued a departure from the band 's earlier releases while displaying a more diverse range of influences . 
 Superunknown was a critical and commercial success and became the band 's breakthrough album . It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 , selling 310 @,@ 000 copies in its opening week and reached high positions on charts worldwide . Five singles were released from the album : " The Day I Tried to Live " , " My Wave " , " Fell on Black Days " , " Spoonman " , and " Black Hole Sun " , the latter two of which won Grammy Awards and helped Soundgarden reach mainstream popularity . In 1995 , the album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album . The album has been certified five times platinum by the RIAA in the United States and has sold around 9 million copies worldwide and remains Soundgarden 's most successful album . Superunknown also enters many lists regarding the best rock albums ever released . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Soundgarden began work on the album about two months after finishing its stint on the 1992 Lollapalooza tour . The individual band members would work on material on their own and then bring in demos to which the other members of the band would contribute . Frontman Chris Cornell said that the band members allowed each other more freedom than on past records . Thayil observed that even though the band spent as much time writing and arranging as it had on previous albums , it spent a lot more time working on recording the songs . After two albums with producer Terry Date , the band decided to seek another collaborator , as guitarist Kim Thayil said , " We just thought we 'd go for a change . " Eventually they settled on producer Michael Beinhorn , who " didn 't have his own trademark sound which he was trying to tack on to Soundgarden " and had ideas the band approved . 
 The album 's recording sessions took place from July 1993 to September 1993 at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle , Washington , as according to Cornell " there was never a decent studio in Seattle and now there 's one with a Neve console , so it seemed obvious to use it . " . Bad Animals ' resident engineer Adam Kasper , who went on to produce Soundgarden 's following albums , assisted Beinhorn on the recording process . Soundgarden took the approach of recording one song at a time . The drum and bass parts were recorded first for each song , and then Cornell and Thayil would lay down their parts over top . Cornell said that getting to know Beinhorn contributed to the length of time Soundgarden spent working on the album . The band spent time experimenting with different drum and guitar sounds , as well as utilizing techniques such as layering , resulting in an expansive production sound . Cornell said , " Michael Beinhorn was so into sounds . He was so , almost , anal about it , that it took the piss out of us a lot of the time ... By the time you get the sounds that you want to record the song , you 're sick and tired of playing it . " Beinhorn tried to add many of his preferred musicians to mold the band 's sound , in what Billboard described as " weaning the band from brute force , giving it the impetus to invest in a more subtle power " . For instance , prior to recording the vocals of " Black Hole Sun " , Beinhorn made Cornell listen to Frank Sinatra . 
 Superunknown lasts for 15 songs clocking on approximately 70 minutes because according to Cornell , " we didn ’ t really want to argue over what should be cut " . Soundgarden took a break in the middle of recording to open for Neil Young on a ten @-@ day tour of the United States . The band then brought in Brendan O 'Brien to mix the album , as Beinhorn felt the band needed " a fresh pair of ears " ; O 'Brien had come recommended by Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard . Thayil called the mixing process " very painless , " and bassist Ben Shepherd said it was " the fastest part of the record . "

 The songs on Superunknown captured the metal influences of the band 's previous works while showcasing the group 's newly evolving style . Steve Huey of AllMusic said that the band 's " earlier punk influences are rarely detectable , replaced by surprisingly effective appropriations of pop and psychedelia . " Cornell labeled the album as more " challenging " and " versatile " than the band 's previous releases . The songs on the album are more experimental and diverse than the band 's previous recordings , with some songs having a Middle @-@ Eastern or Indian flavor ( for example " Half " , sung by Shepherd ) . Some songs also show a Beatles influence , such as " Head Down " and " Black Hole Sun " . In a 1994 interview with Guitar World , Thayil explained , " We looked deep down inside the very core of our souls and there was a little Ringo sitting there . Oh sure , we like telling people it 's John Lennon or George Harrison ; but when you really look deep inside of Soundgarden , there 's a little Ringo wanting to get out . " Drummer Matt Cameron said that the experimentation on the album was " just a matter of refinement . " According to The A.V. Club , the album " both redefined and transcended grunge " . Michael Beinhorn stated that to achieve the intensity of Superunknown , he sought influence from European electronic music , such as the British Aphex Twin and the Dutch genre of <unk> , described by him as " some of the rawest music made " . 
 Soundgarden utilized alternative tunings and odd time signatures on several of the album 's songs . " Spoonman " , " Black Hole Sun " , " Let Me Drown " and " <unk> " were performed in drop D tuning while " Mailman " and " Limo Wreck " employed <unk> tuning . Some songs used more unorthodox tunings : " My Wave " and " The Day I Tried to Live " are both in an <unk> tuning . " Head Down " and " Half " used <unk> tuning and " Like Suicide " is performed in <unk> tuning . Soundgarden 's use of odd time signatures was varied as well ; " My Wave " uses 5 / 4 , " Fell On Black Days " is in 6 / 4 , " Limo Wreck " is played in 15 / 8 , " The Day I Tried to Live " and " Spoonman " both alternate between 7 / 4 and 4 / 4 sections , and " Black Hole Sun " is in 4 / 4 and 9 / 8 . Thayil has said that Soundgarden usually did not consider the time signature of a song until after the band had written it , and said that the use of odd meters was " a total accident . " 
 Lyrically , the album is quite dark and mysterious , as much of it is often interpreted to be dealing with issues such as substance abuse , suicide , and depression , with running themes of revenge , annihilation , seclusion , fear , loss , death , and discovery . Cornell was inspired by the writings of Sylvia Plath at the time . Commenting on the album 's lyrics , Thayil said that " a lot of Superunknown seems to me to be about life , not death . Maybe not affirming it , but rejoicing — like the Druids [ put it ] : ' Life is good , but death 's gonna be even better ! " Cameron said that the lyrics on the album are " a big fuck @-@ you to the world , a plea to ' leave us alone . ' " Cornell stated that " Let Me Drown " is about " crawling back to the womb to die , " " Fell on Black Days " is about realizing " you 're unhappy in the extreme , " " Black Hole Sun " is about a " surreal dreamscape , " " Limo Wreck " is a " ' shame @-@ on @-@ decadence ' song , " " The Day I Tried to Live " is about " trying to step out of being patterned and closed off and reclusive , " and " 4th of July " is about using LSD . Cornell talked about " Mailman " at a concert saying , " This next one is about killing your boss . It 's about coming to work early one morning cause you have a special agenda and you 're going to shoot him in the fucking head . " Conversely , " Like Suicide " was literal , written by Cornell after a bird flew into a window of his house . He found the severely injured animal and killed it , hitting it with a brick to end its suffering . 
 The song " Spoonman " is notable for featuring a performance by Artis the Spoonman , a street entertainer in Seattle . The title of the song is credited to bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam . While on the set of the movie Singles , Ament produced a list of song titles for the fictional band featured in the movie . Cornell took it as a challenge to write songs for the film using those titles , and " Spoonman " was one of them . An acoustic demo version of the song appears in the movie . Cornell said that the song is about " the paradox of who [ Artis ] is and what people perceive him as . "

 The album 's cover art ( known as the ' Screaming Elf ' ) is a distorted photograph of the band members , photographed by Kevin Westenberg , above a black and white upside @-@ down burning forest . Concerning the artwork , Cornell said , " Superunknown relates to birth in a way ... Being born or even dying — getting flushed into something that you know nothing about . The hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that . The first thing we thought of was a forest in grey or black . Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite . It still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold ... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in . " In a 1994 Pulse ! magazine interview , Cornell said that the inspiration for the album 's title came from his misreading of a video entitled <unk> . He added , " I thought it was a cool title . I 'd never heard it before , never saw it before , and it inspired me . " The album also saw a limited release on 12 " colored vinyl ( blue , orange , and clear ) , as a double @-@ LP in a gatefold sleeve .

 Superunknown received positive reviews from critics . Q said " Soundgarden dealt in unreconstructed heavy rock : a heavy guitar sound , depth @-@ charge drumming .... Yet Superunknown also includes more measured moments " . Rolling Stone magazine 's J. D. Considine was impressed by the record 's range and despite criticizing " Black Hole Sun " and " Half " , he said " at its best , Superunknown offers a more harrowing depiction of alienation and despair than anything on In Utero . " Jon Pareles from The New York Times credited the band with trying to transcend conventional heavy metal : " Superunknown actually tries to broaden its audience by breaking heavy @-@ metal genre barriers that Soundgarden used to accept . " In Entertainment Weekly , David Browne wrote , " Soundgarden is pumped and primed on Superunknown , and they deliver the goods . " He praised it as a " hard @-@ rock milestone @-@ a boiling vat of volcanic power , record @-@ making smarts , and ' 90s anomie and anxiety that sets a new standard for anything called metal . " Ann Powers from Blender said that on the album " guitarist Thayil helps create the stoner @-@ rock template , " and that it " stands as Soundgarden ’ s masterpiece . " Village Voice critic Robert Christgau , who had " mocked " Soundgarden 's " conceptual <unk> for years " , still felt their <unk> , pessimistic lyrics lacked much substance , but said they had improved composing , arranging , and producing on an album that was " easily the best — most galvanizing , kinetic , sensational , catchy — Zep rip in history . " In a retrospective review , AllMusic editor Steve Huey wrote , " It 's obvious that Superunknown was consciously styled as a masterwork , and it fulfills every ambition . " It received a nomination in the Best Rock Album category for the 1995 Grammy Awards .

 The band began touring in January 1994 in Oceania and Japan , areas where the record came out early . The band had never toured these regions before . This round of touring ended in February 1994 , and then in March 1994 the band moved on to Europe . The band began a theater tour in the United States on May 27 , 1994 . The opening acts were Tad and Eleven . In late 1994 , after touring in support of Superunknown , doctors discovered that Cornell had severely strained his vocal cords . Soundgarden cancelled several shows to avoid causing any permanent damage . Cornell said , " I think we kinda overdid it ! We were playing five or six nights a week and my voice pretty much took a beating . Towards the end of the American tour I felt like I could still kinda sing , but I wasn 't really giving the band a fair shake . You don 't buy a ticket to see some guy croak for two hours ! That seemed like kind of a rip off . " The band would make up the dates later in 1995 .

 Although the album 's singles featured quite a few B @-@ sides , only " Exit Stonehenge " ( from the " Spoonman " single ) was sourced from the Superunknown recording sessions in 1993 . " Cold Bitch " ( also from " Spoonman " ) was recorded during the Badmotorfinger recording sessions in 1991 , " Kyle Petty , Son of Richard " and " Motorcycle Loop " ( both from the " Fell on Black Days " single ) were recorded by Stuart <unk> at Avast Studios in Seattle in 1994 . " Kyle Petty , Son of Richard " was later featured on the 1996 Home Alive compilation . " Tighter & Tighter " , " No Attention " , and " An <unk> " , all of which later appeared on the band 's 1996 album , Down on the Upside , were attempted during the Superunknown recording sessions . Cameron said that the band wasn 't pleased with the recording of " No Attention " that came out of the sessions . An instrumental entitled " Ruff Riff @-@ Raff " and a light @-@ hearted song called " Bing Bing Goes to Church " were recorded at album rehearsals but were presumably not recorded during the Superunknown recording sessions .

 = United Airlines Flight 93 = 
 United Airlines Flight 93 was a domestic scheduled passenger flight that was hijacked by four Al @-@ Qaeda terrorists on board , as part of the September 11 attacks . It crashed into a field near the Diamond T. Mine in Stonycreek Township , Somerset County , Pennsylvania , near Indian Lake and Shanksville , during an attempt by some of the passengers to regain control , killing all 44 people aboard including the four hijackers . No one on the ground was injured . The aircraft involved , a Boeing 757 – 222 , was flying United Airlines ' daily scheduled morning domestic flight from Newark International Airport in New Jersey to San Francisco International Airport in California . 
 The hijackers breached the aircraft 's cockpit and overpowered the flight crew approximately 46 minutes after takeoff . Ziad Jarrah , a trained pilot , took control of the aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast of the United States in the direction of Washington , D.C. Although the specific target is not known , it is believed that the hijackers were intending to crash the plane into either the White House or the Capitol Building . 
 After the hijackers took control of the plane , several passengers and flight attendants were able to make phone calls and learn that attacks had already been made by other hijacked airliners on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Arlington County , Virginia . Many of the passengers then attacked the hijackers in an attempt to gain control of the aircraft . During the struggle , the hijackers decided to crash the plane rather than cede control : the plane crashed into a field near a reclaimed strip mine in Stonycreek Township , near Indian Lake and Shanksville in Somerset County , Pennsylvania , about 65 miles ( 105 km ) southeast of Pittsburgh and 130 miles ( 210 km ) northwest of Washington , D.C. A few witnessed the impact from the ground and news agencies began reporting the event within an hour . 
 Subsequent analysis of the flight recorders recovered from the crash site revealed how the actions taken by the passengers prevented the aircraft from reaching the hijackers ' intended target . Of the four aircraft hijacked on September 11 – the others were American Airlines Flight 11 , American Airlines Flight 77 and United Airlines Flight 175 – United Airlines Flight 93 was the only one that did not reach its hijackers ' intended target . 
 A temporary memorial has stood on the site since the attacks ; the first phase of construction of the permanent Flight 93 National Memorial at the crash site was dedicated on September 10 , 2011 . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 The hijacking of Flight 93 was led by Ziad Jarrah , a member of al @-@ Qaeda . Jarrah was born in Lebanon to a wealthy family and had a secular upbringing . He intended to become a pilot and moved to Germany in 1996 , enrolling at the University of Greifswald to study German . A year later , he moved to Hamburg and began studying aeronautical engineering at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences . While living in Hamburg , Jarrah became a devout Muslim and associated with the radical Hamburg cell . 
 In November 1999 , Jarrah left Hamburg for Afghanistan , where he spent three months . While there , he met with al @-@ Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in January 2000 . Jarrah returned to Hamburg at the end of January and obtained a clean passport in February by reporting his passport as stolen . 
 In May , Jarrah received a visa from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin , and he arrived in Florida in June 2000 . There , he began taking flying lessons as well as training in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . Jarrah maintained contact with his girlfriend in Germany and his family in the months preceding the attacks . This close contact upset Mohamed Atta , the tactical leader of the plot , and al @-@ Qaeda planners may have considered another operative , Zacarias Moussaoui , to replace him if he backed out . 
 Four " muscle " hijackers were trained to storm the cockpit and overpower the crew , and three accompanied Jarrah on Flight 93 . The first , Ahmed al @-@ Nami , arrived in Miami , Florida , on May 28 , 2001 , on a six @-@ month tourist visa with United Airlines Flight 175 hijackers Hamza al @-@ Ghamdi and <unk> al @-@ Shehri . The second Flight 93 hijacker , Ahmed al @-@ Haznawi , arrived in Miami on June 8 with Flight 11 hijacker Wail al @-@ Shehri . The third Flight 93 muscle hijacker , Saeed al @-@ Ghamdi , arrived in Orlando , Florida , on June 27 with Flight 175 hijacker Fayez <unk> . 
 On August 3 , 2001 , an intended fifth hijacker , Mohammed al @-@ Qahtani , flew into Orlando from Dubai . He was questioned by officials , who were dubious that he could support himself with only $ 2 @,@ 800 cash to his name , and suspicious that he intended to become an illegal immigrant as he was using a one @-@ way ticket . He was sent back to Dubai , and subsequently returned to Saudi Arabia . 
 Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al @-@ Ghamdi 's passports were recovered from the Flight 93 crash site . Jarrah 's family asserted that he had been an " innocent passenger " on board the flight . 
 = = Flight = = 
 The aircraft involved in the hijacking was a Boeing 757 – 222 , registration <unk> , delivered to the airline in 1996 . The airplane had a capacity of 182 passengers ; the September 11 flight carried 37 passengers and seven crew , a load factor of 20 percent , considerably below the 52 percent average Tuesday load factor for Flight 93 . The seven crew members were Captain Jason Dahl , First Officer LeRoy Homer , Jr . , and flight attendants Lorraine Bay , Sandra Bradshaw , Wanda Green , CeeCee Lyles and Deborah Welsh . 
 = = = Boarding = = = 
 The four hijackers checked in for the flight between 07 : 03 and 07 : 39 Eastern Time . At 07 : 03 , Ghamdi checked in without any luggage while Nami checked in two bags . At 07 : 24 , Haznawi checked in one bag and at 07 : 39 , Jarrah checked in without any luggage . Haznawi was the only hijacker selected for extra scrutiny by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System ( CAPPS ) . His checked bag underwent extra screening for explosives , with no extra scrutiny required by CAPPS at the passenger @-@ security checkpoint . None of the security checkpoint personnel reported anything unusual about the hijackers . 
 Haznawi and Ghamdi boarded the aircraft at 07 : 39 and sat in first class seats 6B and 3D respectively . Nami boarded one minute later and sat in first class seat 3C . Jarrah boarded at 07 : 48 and sat in seat 1B . The aircraft was scheduled to depart at 08 : 00 and pushed back from gate A17 at 08 : 01 . It remained delayed on the ground and did not take off until 08 : 42 because of heavy airport congestion . The three other hijacked flights all departed within fifteen minutes of their scheduled times . By the time Flight 93 became airborne , Flight 11 was four minutes away from hitting the North Tower and Flight 175 was being hijacked ; Flight 77 was climbing normally and was nine minutes away from being hijacked . By 09 : 02 , one minute before Flight 175 hit the South Tower , Flight 93 reached its cruising altitude of 35 @,@ 000 feet ( 11 @,@ 000 m ) . With the attacks unfolding , air traffic officials began issuing warnings through the Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System ( ACARS ) . Ed Ballinger , the United flight dispatcher , began sending text cockpit warnings to United Airlines flights at 09 : 19 , 17 minutes after he became aware of Flight 175 's impact . As Ballinger was responsible for multiple flights , he did not send the message to Flight 93 until 09 : 23 . Ballinger received a routine ACARS message from Flight 93 at 09 : 21 . At 09 : 22 , after learning of the events at the World Trade Center , LeRoy Homer 's wife , Melody Homer , had an ACARS message sent to her husband in the cockpit asking if he was okay . At 09 : 24 , Flight 93 received Ballinger 's ACARS warning , " Beware any cockpit intrusion — two a / c [ aircraft ] hit World Trade Center " . At 09 : 26 , the pilot sent an ACARS message back , " Ed , confirm latest <unk> <unk> — Jason " . At 09 : 27 : 25 , the flight crew responded to routine radio traffic from air traffic control . This was the last communication made by the flight crew before the hijacking . 
 = = = Hijacking = = = 
 The hijacking on Flight 93 began at 09 : 28 . By this time , Flights 11 and 175 had already crashed into the World Trade Center and Flight 77 was within 9 minutes of striking the Pentagon . The hijackers on those flights had waited no more than 30 minutes to commandeer the aircraft , most likely striking after the seat @-@ belt sign had been turned off and cabin service had begun . It is unknown why the hijackers on Flight 93 waited approximately 46 minutes to begin their assault . At 09 : 28 : 17 , First Officer Homer managed to transmit to the ground , shouting , " Mayday ! Mayday ! Get out ! " over the radio amidst sounds of violence . A Cleveland Air Traffic Controller replied , " Somebody call Cleveland ? " but received no reply . 
 Thirty @-@ five seconds after the first Mayday call , the crew made another transmission . Homer shouted , " Mayday ! Mayday ! Get out of here ! We 're all gonna die here ! " The flight suddenly dropped 685 feet ( 209 m ) in half a minute before the hijackers managed to stabilise the aircraft . The exact time at which Flight 93 came under the hijackers ' control cannot be determined . Officials believe that at 09 : 28 , the hijackers assaulted the cockpit and moved the passengers to the rear of the plane at the same time to minimize any chance of either the crew or the passengers interfering with the attack . While the other hijacked flights were taken by five @-@ man teams , Flight 93 had only four hijackers , leading to speculation of a possible 20th hijacker . The 9 / 11 Commission believes that Mohammed al @-@ Qahtani was the likely candidate for this role , but was unable to participate as he had been denied entry into the United States one month earlier . With many passengers saying in phone calls that they saw only three hijackers , the 9 / 11 Commission believes Jarrah remained seated until the crew were overpowered and passengers were moved to the back the aircraft and then took over the flight controls out of sight of the passengers . 
 The flight recordings suggest that Dahl and Homer survived the initial attack and were still alive on the floor of the cockpit after the hijackers took over the plane , as sounds of moaning can be heard and the hijackers were rebuking someone in the cockpit . Dahl 's and Homer 's wives believes that Dahl and Homer took actions to interfere with the hijackers , including putting the plane on autopilot just before the hijackers took over , and switching the output of the pilots ' microphones from the cabin address speakers to the radio transmitter so that Jarrah 's attempts to communicate with the passengers would instead be heard by air traffic controllers . 
 The cockpit voice recorder began recording the final 30 minutes of Flight 93 at 09 : 31 : 57 . At this moment , it recorded Jarrah announcing , " Ladies and gentlemen : here the captain . Please sit down , keep remaining seating . We have a bomb on board . So sit . " The controller understood the transmission , but chose to respond , " Calling Cleveland center , you 're unreadable . Say again , slowly . " A woman , presumably first @-@ class flight attendant Debbie Welsh , is heard struggling with the hijackers before being killed or otherwise silenced , followed by one of the hijackers saying in Arabic , " Everything is fine . I finished . " 
 Jarrah instructed the autopilot to turn the plane and head east at 09 : 35 : 09 . The aircraft ascended to 40 @,@ 700 feet ( 12 @,@ 400 m ) and air traffic controllers immediately moved several aircraft out of Flight 93 's flightpath . 
 At 09 : 39 , two minutes after Flight 77 impacted the Pentagon , air traffic controllers overheard Jarrah say , " Here 's the captain : I would like to tell you all to remain seated . We have a bomb aboard , and we are going back to the airport , and we have our demands . So please remain quiet . " Air traffic controllers did not hear from the flight again . Passengers and crew began making phone calls to officials and family members starting at 09 : 30 using GTE <unk> and mobile phones . Altogether , the passengers and crew made 35 <unk> calls and two cell phone calls from the flight . Ten passengers and two crew members were able to successfully connect , providing information to family , friends , and others on the ground . Tom Burnett made several phone calls to his wife beginning at 09 : 30 : 32 from rows 24 and 25 , though he was assigned a seat in row four . Burnett explained that the plane had been hijacked by men claiming to have a bomb . He also said that a passenger had been stabbed with a knife and that he believed the bomb threat was a ruse to control the passengers . During one of Tom Burnett 's calls , his wife informed him of the attacks on the World Trade Center and he replied that the hijackers were " talking about crashing this plane . ... Oh my God . It 's a suicide mission . " He began pumping her for information about the attacks , interrupting her from time to time to tell the others nearby what she was saying . Then he hung up . He ended his last call by saying , " Don 't worry , we 're going to do something . " An unknown flight attendant attempted to contact the United Airlines maintenance facility at 09 : 32 : 29 . The call lasted 95 seconds , but was not received as it may have been in queue . Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called the maintenance facility at 09 : 35 : 40 from row 33 . She reported the flight had been hijacked by men with knives who were in the cabin and flight deck and had stabbed another flight attendant , possibly Debbie Welsh . 
 Mark Bingham called his mother at 09 : 37 : 03 from row 25 . He reported that the plane had been hijacked by three men who claimed to have a bomb . Jeremy Glick called his wife at 09 : 37 : 41 from row 27 and told her the flight was hijacked by three dark @-@ skinned men that looked " Iranian " , wearing red bandanas and wielding knives . Glick remained connected until the end of the flight . He reported that the passengers voted whether to " rush " the hijackers . The United air traffic control coordinator for West Coast flights , Alessandro " Sandy " Rogers , alerted the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) Herndon Command Center in Herndon , Virginia , that Flight 93 was not responding and was off course . A minute later , the transponder was turned off , but the Cleveland controller continued to monitor the flight on primary radar . The Herndon Center relayed information on Flight 93 to FAA headquarters . Joseph DeLuca called his father at 09 : 43 : 03 from row 26 to inform him the flight had been hijacked . Todd Beamer attempted to call his wife from row 32 at 09 : 43 : 48 , but was routed to GTE phone operator Lisa D. Jefferson . Beamer told the operator that the flight was hijacked and the pilots were on the floor dead or dying . He said one of the hijackers had a red belt with what looked to be a bomb strapped to his waist . When the hijackers veered the plane sharply south , Beamer briefly panicked , exclaiming , " We 're going down ! We 're going down ! " Meanwhile , the hijackers were not able to disengage the autopilot . Dahl continued to struggle in the cockpit , refusing to allow a hijacker to deactivate the autopilot so he could fly the plane manually . The hijackers were heard to say " Inform them , and tell him to talk to the pilot ; bring back the pilot " , possibly referring to Homer ( CVR transcripts ) . A United employee in San Francisco , California , sent an ACARS message to the flight at 09 : 46 , " Heard report of incident . <unk> confirm all is normal . " Linda <unk> called her sister , Elsa Strong , at 09 : 46 : 05 and left her a message saying there were " men with a bomb . " 
 Flight attendant CeeCee Lyles called her husband at 09 : 47 : 57 and left him a message saying the plane had been hijacked . Marion Britton called her friend , Fred <unk> , at 09 : 49 : 12 . <unk> recalled , " she said , ' We 're gonna . They 're gonna kill us , you know , We 're gonna die . ' And I told her , ' Don 't worry , they hijacked the plane , they 're gonna take you for a ride , you go to their country , and you come back . You stay there for vacation . ' You don 't know what to say — what are you gonna say ? I kept on saying the same things , ' Be calm . ' And she was crying and — you know — more or less crying and screaming and yelling . " Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called her husband at 09 : 50 : 04 and told him she was preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers . Passenger Lauren <unk> called her husband twice , once before takeoff and once during the hijacking . He missed both of her calls . She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth <unk> . <unk> called her stepmother at 09 : 53 : 43 and concluded , four and a half minutes later , by saying , " I have to go . They 're breaking into the cockpit . I love you . " Jarrah dialed in the VHF omnidirectional range ( VOR ) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09 : 55 : 11 to direct the plane toward Washington , D.C. Bradshaw , on the phone with her husband , said " Everyone is running up to first class . I 've got to go . Bye . " Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to " jump on " the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers ' plan could be followed through . Beamer recited the Lord 's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson , prompting others to join in . Beamer requested of Jefferson , " If I don 't make it , please call my family and let them know how much I love them . " After this , Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering , " Are you ready ? Okay . Let 's roll . " These were Beamer 's last words to Jefferson . 
 During the hijacking , Flight 93 passed within 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) ( instead of the normal 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) ) of a NASA KC @-@ 135 returning from a microgravity flight over Lake Ontario . NASA pilot Dominic Del Rosso recalled how odd the silence on the radio was that morning . 
 = = = Passenger revolt = = = 
 The passenger revolt on Flight 93 began at 09 : 57 , after the passengers took a vote amongst themselves about whether to act . By this time , Flight 77 had struck the Pentagon and Flights 11 and 175 had struck the World Trade Center towers . As the revolt began and the hijackers started maneuvering the plane around violently , the plane went off of its Washington , D.C. course . The hijackers in the cockpit became aware of the revolt at 09 : 57 : 55 , Jarrah exclaiming , " Is there something ? A fight ? " 
 Edward Felt dialed 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 from his cell phone from the lavatory of the aircraft seeking information . His call was answered by dispatcher John Shaw , and Felt was able to tell him about the hijacking before the call was disconnected . Multiple news reports ( originally based on a 911 supervisor 's account after having overheard the call ) asserted that Edward Felt reported hearing an explosion and seeing smoke from an undetermined location on the plane . These reports were not corroborated by Shaw or Felt 's wife , Sandra , who listened to the recording afterwards . 
 CeeCee Lyles called her husband once more from a cell phone and told him the passengers were forcing their way into the cockpit . Jarrah began to roll the airplane left and right to knock the passengers off balance . He told another hijacker in the cockpit at 09 : 58 : 57 , just two seconds before the South Tower collapsed , " They want to get in here . Hold , hold from the inside . Hold from the inside . Hold . " Jarrah changed tactics at 09 : 59 : 52 and pitched the nose of the airplane up and down to disrupt the assault . 
 The cockpit voice recorder captured the sounds of crashing , screaming , and the shattering of glass and plates . Three times in a period of five seconds there were shouts of pain or distress from a hijacker outside the cockpit . Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10 : 00 : 03 . Five seconds later , he asked , " Is that it ? Shall we finish it off ? " Another hijacker responded , " No . Not yet . When they all come , we finish it off . " Jarrah once again pitched the airplane up and down . A passenger in the background cried , " In the cockpit . If we don 't , we 'll die " at 10 : 00 : 25 . Sixteen seconds later , another passenger yelled , " Roll it ! " , possibly referring to using the food cart . The voice recorder did record the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door . Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10 : 01 : 00 and said Allāhu Akbar ( God is Great ) several times . He then asked another hijacker , " Is that it ? I mean , shall we put it down ? " The other hijacker responded , " Yes , put it in it , and pull it down . " Nevertheless , the passengers continued their assault and at 10 : 02 : 17 , a male passenger said , " Turn it up ! " A second later , a hijacker said , " Pull it down ! Pull it down ! " At 10 : 02 : 33 , Jarrah was heard to plead , " Hey ! Hey ! Give it to me ! Give it to me ! Give it to me ! Give it to me ! Give it to me ! Give it to me ! Give it to me ! Give it to me ! " , possibly referring to the plane 's yoke . The airplane plummeted into a nosedive with the yoke turned hard to the right . The airplane rolled upside down , and one of the hijackers began shouting Allāhu Akbar . Amidst the continued sounds of the passenger counterattack , the aircraft picked up speed , whooshing and shrieking picked up on the recorder , and then finally plowed into an empty field in Stonycreek , Pennsylvania , about 20 minutes ' flying time from Washington , D.C. The last entry on the voice recorder was made at 10 : 03 : 09 . The last piece of flight data was recorded at 10 : 03 : 10 . There is some controversy between some of the family members of the passengers and the investigative officials as to whether the passengers managed to breach the cockpit . The 9 / 11 Commission Report concluded that " the hijackers remained at the controls but must have judged that the passengers were only seconds from overcoming them . " However , many of the passengers ' family members , having heard the audio recordings , believe that the passengers breached the cockpit and killed at least one of the hijackers guarding the cockpit door ; some interpreted the audio as suggesting that both the passengers and hijackers struggled for control of the yoke .

 At 10 : 03 : 11 , near Indian Lake and Shanksville , Pennsylvania , the plane crashed into a field near a reclaimed coal strip mine known as the Diamond T. Mine owned by PBS Coals in Stonycreek Township in Somerset County . The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the flight impacted at 563 mph ( 906 km / h , 252 m / s , or 489 knots ) at a 40 @-@ degree nose @-@ down , inverted attitude . The impact left a crater eight to ten feet deep ( c . 3 m ) , and 30 to 50 feet wide ( c . 12 m ) . All 44 people on board died . Many media reports and eyewitness accounts said the time of the crash was 10 : 06 or 10 : 10 ; an initial analysis of <unk> data in the area concluded that the crash occurred at 10 : 06 , but the 9 / 11 Commission report states that this analysis was not definitive and was retracted . Other media outlets and the 9 / 11 Commission reported the time of impact as 10 : 03 , based on when the flight recorders stopped , analysis of radar data , infrared satellite data , and air traffic control transmissions . 
 Kelly <unk> , a local resident , was watching news of the attacks when she heard the plane . " I heard the plane going over and I went out the front door and I saw the plane going down . It was headed toward the school , which panicked me , because all three of my kids were there . Then you heard the explosion and felt the blast and saw the fire and smoke . " Another witness , Eric Peterson , looked up when he heard the plane , " It was low enough , I thought you could probably count the rivets . You could see more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly . It was on its side . There was a great explosion and you could see the flames . It was a massive , massive explosion . Flames and then smoke and then a massive , massive mushroom cloud . " Val <unk> had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane . She saw it briefly , then heard the impact . The crash knocked out the electricity and phones . <unk> grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion . Ten years after 9 / 11 , a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave <unk> ( deceased by 2011 ) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube . 
 The first responders arrived at the crash site after 10 : 06 . Cleveland Center controllers , unaware the flight had crashed , notified the Northeast Air Defense Sector ( NEADS ) at 10 : 07 that Flight 93 had a bomb on board and passed the last known position . This call was the first time the military was notified about the flight . Ballinger sent one final ACARS message to Flight 93 at 10 : 10 , " Don 't divert to DC . Not an option . " He repeated the message one minute later . The Herndon Command Center alerted FAA headquarters that Flight 93 had crashed at 10 : 13 . NEADS called the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center for an update on Flight 93 and received notification that the flight had crashed . 
 At 10 : 37 , CNN correspondent Aaron Brown , covering the collapse of the World Trade Center , announced , " We are getting reports and we are getting lots of reports and we want to be careful to tell you when we have confirmed them and not , but we have a report that a 747 is down in Pennsylvania , and that remains unconfirmed at this point . " He followed that up at 10 : 49 by reporting that , " We have a report now that a large plane crashed this morning , north of the Somerset County Airport , which is in western Pennsylvania , not too terribly far from Pittsburgh , about 80 miles or so , a Boeing 767 jet . Don 't know whose airline it was , whose airplane it was , and we don 't have any details beyond that which I have just given you . " In the confusion , he also erroneously reported a second hijacked plane heading for the Pentagon after the crash of the first . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Flight 93 fragmented violently upon impact . Most of the aircraft wreckage was found near the impact crater . Investigators found some very light debris including paper and nylon scattered up to eight miles ( 13 km ) from the impact point in New Baltimore , Pennsylvania . Other tiny aircraft fragments were found 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) away at Indian Lake , Pennsylvania . All human remains were found within a 70 @-@ acre ( 28 ha ) area surrounding the impact point . Somerset County Coroner Wally Miller was involved in the investigation and identification of the remains . In examining the wreckage , the only human body part he could see was part of a backbone . Miller later found and identified 1 @,@ 500 pieces of human remains totaling about 600 pounds ( 272 kg ) , or eight percent of the total . The rest of the remains were consumed by the impact . Investigators identified four victims by September 22 and eleven by September 24 . They identified another by September 29 . Thirty @-@ four passengers were identified by October 27 . All the people on board the flight were identified by December 21 . Human remains were so fragmented that investigators could not determine whether any victims were dead before the plane crashed . Death certificates for the 40 victims listed the cause of death as homicide and listed the cause of death for the four hijackers as suicide . The remains and personal effects of the victims were returned to the families . The remains of the hijackers , identified by the process of elimination , were turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) as evidence . 
 Investigators also found a knife concealed in a cigarette lighter . They located the flight data recorder on September 13 and the cockpit voice recorder the following day . The voice recorder was found buried 25 feet ( 8 m ) below the crater . The FBI initially refused to release the voice recording , rejecting requests by Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher and family members of those on board . The FBI subsequently allowed the relatives of the Flight 93 victims to listen to the recording in a closed session on April 18 , 2002 . Jurors for the Zacarias Moussaoui trial heard the tape as part of the proceedings and the transcript was publicly released on April 12 , 2006 . 
 Since it never reached a target , the exact place intended to be hit by Flight 93 has never been decisively confirmed . Before the attacks , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Osama bin Laden , and Mohammed Atef developed a list of potential targets . Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon . Sheikh Mohammed wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all three wanted to hit the Capitol . No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets . Bin Laden told 9 / 11 planner Ramzi bin al @-@ Shibh to advise Mohamed Atta that he preferred the White House over the Capitol as a target . Atta cautioned bin al @-@ Shibh that this would be difficult , but agreed to include the White House as a possible target and suggested they keep the Capitol as an alternative in case the White House proved too difficult . Eventually , Atta told bin al @-@ Shibh that Jarrah planned to hit the Capitol . Atta briefly mentioned the possibility of striking a nuclear facility , but balked after the other attack pilots voiced their opposition . Based on an exchange between Atta and bin al @-@ Shibh two days before the attacks , the White House would be the primary target for the fourth plane and the Capitol the secondary target . 
 Immediately after the attacks , there was speculation that Camp David was the intended target . According to testimony by captured al @-@ Qaeda member Abu <unk> , U.S. officials believed the White House was the intended target . A post @-@ 9 / 11 interview with Sheikh Mohammed and bin al @-@ Shibh by Al Jazeera reporter <unk> Fouda revealed that Flight 93 was headed for the Capitol . The 9 / 11 Commission Report cited the actions of the crew and passengers in preventing the destruction of either the White House or the Capitol . According to further testimony by Sheikh Mohammed , bin Laden preferred the Capitol over the White House as a target and Sheikh Mohammed revealed that the interview to Fouda was a lie to make the 9 / 11 attacks seem larger than they were . Salim Hamdan , bin Laden 's driver , told interrogators that he knew the flight was headed for the Capitol . 
 All passengers and crew on board Flight 93 were nominated for the Congressional Gold Medal on September 19 , 2001 . Congressman Bill Shuster introduced a bill to this effect in 2006 , and they were granted on September 11 , 2014 . 
 Beamer 's final words , " let 's roll " , became a national catchphrase . The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey changed the name of Newark 's airport from Newark International Airport to Newark Liberty International Airport and a flag now flies over Terminal A 's Gate A17 . Flight 93 has been the subject of various films and documentaries including The Flight That Fought Back , Flight 93 , and the feature film United 93 . 
 In keeping with standard airline practice after disasters , the flight number " 93 " was discontinued by United Airlines after the hijacking . United has many <unk> from Newark to San Francisco . As of May 2016 there is still an 8 : 00 A.M. flight from Newark to San Francisco , and is still using a Boeing 757 , but is now Flight 497 . It was reported in May 2011 that United was reactivating flight numbers 93 and 175 as a codeshare operated by Continental , sparking an outcry from some in the media and the labor union representing United pilots . United said the reactivation was a mistake and said the numbers were " inadvertently reinstated " , and would not be reactivated . 
 = = = Fighter jet response = = = 
 A fighter pilot based at Andrews Air Force base , Billy Hutchison , claims that while in the air he spotted Flight 93 on his scope and planned to first fire his training rounds into the engine and cockpit , and then ram the airplane with his own jet . His account was published in Lynn Spencer 's book Touching History . John Farmer , Senior Counsel to the 9 / 11 commission , pointed out that this account would have been impossible , as Hutchison 's Air Andrews Squadron wasn 't in the air until 10 : 38 , almost 30 minutes after Flight 93 had crashed . When the 9 / 11 commission asked Hutchinson why he gave this false claim he stormed out of the room and refused to give an answer . 
 Two F @-@ 16 fighter jets from the 121st Fighter Squadron of the D.C. Air National Guard were scrambled and ordered to intercept Flight 93 ; the pilots intended to ram it since they did not have time to arm the jets . They never reached Flight 93 and did not learn of its crash until hours afterwards . 
 The North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) insisted to the 9 / 11 Commission that fighters would have intercepted Flight 93 before it reached its target in Washington , D.C. , but the commission disagreed , stating that " NORAD did not even know the plane was hijacked until after it had crashed " and concluding that had it not crashed it probably would have arrived in Washington by 10 : 23 . The 9 / 11 Commission Report stated that NEADS fighters pursued Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 , a flight thought to be hijacked . The commission found that NORAD and the FAA gave inaccurate testimony .

 A temporary memorial formed from spontaneous tributes left by visitors in the days after the attacks at the crash site . Foundations across the country began to raise money to fund a memorial to the victims within a month of the crash . 
 Two years after the attacks , federal officials formed the Flight 93 National Memorial Advisory Commission responsible for making design recommendations for a permanent memorial . A national design competition was held to create a public memorial in the Pennsylvania field where Flight 93 crashed . The winning design , " Crescent of Embrace , " was selected out of a pool of 1 @,@ 011 submissions on September 7 , 2005 . The site plan features a large crescent pathway with red maples and sugar maples planted along the outer arc . This design ran into opposition over funding , size , and appearance . Republican Congressman Charles H. Taylor blocked $ 10 million in federal funds toward the project as he saw it as " unrealistic . " Republican Congressional leaders later persuaded him to acquiesce to political pressure and began approving some federal funds . The proposed design has also attracted critics who see Islamic symbolism in the crescent design . An important milestone was announced August 31 , 2009 , marking an agreement between the landowners and the National Park Service to allow the purchase of land for around 9 @.@ 5 million dollars . The memorial was dedicated on September 10 , 2011 , the day before the 10th anniversary of the crash of Flight 93 . 
 CeeCee Lyles was one of the flight attendants on board . In 2003 , a statue of Lyles was unveiled in her hometown of Fort Pierce , Florida , which has since gained national recognition as one of the many monuments to the attacks . 
 On August 9 , 2007 , a portion of U.S. 219 in Somerset County , near the Flight 93 National Memorial , was co @-@ signed as the Flight 93 Memorial Highway . 
 At the National September 11 Memorial , the names of the 40 victims of Flight 93 are inscribed on Panels S @-@ 67 and S @-@ 68 at the South Pool .

 = Death toll of the Nanking Massacre = 
 The total death toll of the Nanking Massacre is a highly contentious subject in Chinese and Japanese historiography . Following the outbreak of the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War , the Japanese Imperial Army marched from Shanghai to the Chinese capital city of Nanking , and though a large number of Chinese POWs and civilians were slaughtered by the Japanese following their entrance into Nanking on December 13 , 1937 , the precise number remains unknown . Since the late @-@ 1960s when the first academic works on the Nanking Massacre were produced , estimating the approximate death toll of the massacre has been a major topic of scholarly debate . 
 A wide range of numbers have been proposed by historians but , in addition to differing interpretations of the evidence , there have been persistent difficulties in defining the scope of the massacre and determining who among the dead to include as " massacre victims " . Scholars who believe that the massacre took place over a larger geographic range and a longer period of time , and who define " massacre victim " more broadly , have generally produced larger estimates for the death toll . For example , the historian Ikuhiko Hata , who estimates the death toll at 40 @,@ 000 , has argued that the Nanking Massacre took place only with the city of Nanking between December 13 , 1937 , and early February 1938 and that only civilians and disarmed POWs should be included as " massacre victims " . By contrast , the historian Tokushi Kasahara , who estimates the death toll at nearly 200 @,@ 000 , has argued that the Nanking Massacre took place in both the city of Nanking and in surrounding rural areas between December 4 , 1937 , and late March 1938 and that some Chinese soldiers killed on the battlefield should be included alongside POWs and civilians as " massacre victims " . 
 Currently , the most reliable and widely agreed upon figures place the total between the broad range of 40 @,@ 000 to 200 @,@ 000 massacre victims in the entire Nanking Special Administrative District , though numbers even smaller or larger than this have been put forward by Japanese revisionists and the government of China respectively . 
 = = Background = = 
 In July 1937 war broke out in northern China between China and Japan , and by August the fighting had spread to the city of Shanghai . After capturing Shanghai the Japanese Army decided on December 1 to continue its military campaign to the capital city of the Nationalist government of China , Nanking , which is roughly 300 kilometers west of Shanghai . Although the Japanese succeeded in surrounding Nanking and defeating the Chinese garrison stationed there by December 13 , few of the Chinese soldiers within the city formally surrendered . Instead they threw away their uniforms and weapons and hid among the city 's civilian population . Over the course of its subsequent occupation of Nanking the Japanese Army hunted down the former Chinese soldiers within the city and in a large number of cases summarily executed them . At the same time soldiers of the Japanese Army also committed random acts of murder against civilians , and engaged in rape , arson , and looting . These events are collectively known as the Nanking Massacre . 
 = = Early estimates = = 
 The Nanking Massacre was reported internationally within a week of occurring and the first estimate of the full death toll was published on January 24 , 1938 , in the New China Daily . Here Australian journalist Harold Timperley was quoted as stating that 300 @,@ 000 civilians had been killed . However , Timperley 's source for this number was the French humanitarian Father Jacquinot , who was in Shanghai at the time of the massacre , and it might also have included civilian casualties of the Battle of Shanghai . Timperley included a second estimate in his book published later the same year , Japanese Terror In China , which quoted " a foreign member of the University faculty " as stating that " close to 40 @,@ 000 unarmed persons were killed within and near the walls of Nanking " . The source of this information was Miner Searle Bates , an American resident in Nanking who had used the burial records of the Red Swastika Society in his calculations . 
 Between then and the late 1940s these two estimates were commonly cited by reporters and the media . For example , Edgar Snow stated in his 1941 book , The Battle for Asia , that 42 @,@ 000 were massacred in Nanking and 300 @,@ 000 in total between Nanking and Shanghai , figures which were apparently based on these estimates . The 1944 film , The Battle of China , stated that 40 @,@ 000 were killed in the Nanking Massacre . 
 Another early estimate was that of China 's state @-@ run Central News Agency , which reported in February 1938 that the Japanese had slaughtered 60 @,@ 000 to 70 @,@ 000 POWs in Nanking . The same month a representative of the Nationalist Government of China claimed that the Japanese had killed 20 @,@ 000 civilians during the Nanking Massacre . However , in a 1942 speech Chiang Kai @-@ shek raised that figure to " over 200 @,@ 000 civilians " . In 1938 the Red Army of the Communist Party of China reported the total death toll at 42 @,@ 000 massacred . John Rabe , the German head of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone , estimated that between 50 @,@ 000 and 60 @,@ 000 Chinese were killed in Nanking , though this estimate included both military casualties and massacred civilians . 
 After the end of the war between China and Japan in 1945 , these estimates were in turn supplanted by the findings of two war crime trials , the International Military Tribunal of the Far East and the Nanking War Crimes Tribunal . In one estimate the Nanking War Crimes Tribunal put the death toll at more than 300 @,@ 000 , though the Tribunal also recorded other estimates including one of 430 @,@ 000 . The International Military Tribunal of the Far East tallied up 155 @,@ 000 victims of the massacre , though in their verdict against General Iwane Matsui this figure was modified somewhat to " upwards of 100 @,@ 000 people " . However , the prosecution at these trials made little effort to verify the accuracy of their death toll estimates and a considerable amount of dubious and now discredited data was accepted by both tribunals . 
 The first historian to make an academic estimate of the death toll of the Nanking Massacre was Tomio Hora in his 1967 book Kindai Senshi no Nazo ( " Riddles of Modern War History " ) , who argued in favor of 200 @,@ 000 . Since then the death toll of the massacre has been a major topic of discussion among historians across the world . However , emotional arguments and political interference in the debate have tended to hinder the construction of an academic consensus on the number of people killed in the atrocity . 
 = = Debate on the scope of the massacre = = 
 In reference to the greatly divergent ways in which various scholars have delineated the massacre , Askew has affirmed that the debate on the death toll " is meaningless if two completely different definitions are being used " . Noting that different definitions produce vastly different estimates , he believes that even the significant disagreements between the historians Tokushi Kasahara and Ikuhiko Hata would disappear if they had been using the same definitions . 
 = = = Chinese soldiers and POWs as massacre victims = = = 
 The first academic accounts of the Nanking Massacre included as massacre victims all Chinese who were killed by the Japanese Army in and around Nanking , including Chinese soldiers who were killed in action . This definition was supported by Hora and other early scholars . In 1986 Ikuhiko Hata became the first historian to call this definition into question . Hata argued that Chinese troops killed on the battlefield were part of the Battle of Nanking rather than Nanking Massacre , and that only civilians and disarmed POWs should be counted as massacre victims . 
 Since then Kasahara has proposed a definition between these two . He agrees with Hata that Chinese soldiers actively engaged in combat were not massacre victims , but he also includes in his definition of the massacre any Chinese soldiers who were killed on the battlefield but not actively resisting , noting that many confrontations between the Chinese and Japanese Armies were more like one @-@ sided slaughters than battles . For instance , after routing the Chinese in Nanking , Japanese soldiers fired upon and killed a large number of Chinese soldiers who were attempting to escape the battlefield by swimming across the Yangtze River . Many historians including Kasahara view incidents like these where the Japanese fired upon retreating troops to be atrocities , whereas Hata sees them as extensions of combat and not massacres . 
 By contrast Yoshiaki <unk> adopted an even stricter standard than Hata , advocating that only Chinese soldiers captured in uniform and then killed be included as massacre victims . He argued that Chinese soldiers who had thrown away their uniforms were legally executed because the laws of war at the time did not apply to them , though this line of reasoning is hotly disputed by other historians . Most Japanese ultranationalists who deny the Nanking Massacre admit that the Japanese Army killed a large number of Chinese POWs , though they consider these to be legal executions , an argument denounced by mainstream historians .
