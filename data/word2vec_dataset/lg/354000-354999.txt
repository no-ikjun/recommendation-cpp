 Throughout the modern period the situation of indigenous languages has grown increasingly precarious in Mexico , and the numbers of speakers of virtually all indigenous languages have dwindled . Although the absolute number of Nahuatl speakers has actually risen over the past century , indigenous populations have become increasingly marginalized in Mexican society . In 1895 , Nahuatl was spoken by over 5 % of the population . By 2000 , this proportion had fallen to 1 @.@ 49 % . Given the process of marginalization combined with the trend of migration to urban areas and to the United States , some linguists are warning of impending language death . At present Nahuatl is mostly spoken in rural areas by an impoverished class of indigenous subsistence agriculturists . According to the Mexican national statistics institute , <unk> , 51 % of Nahuatl speakers are involved in the farming sector and 6 in 10 receive no wages or less than the minimum wage . 
 From the early 20th century to at least the mid @-@ 1980s , educational policies in Mexico focused on the <unk> ( <unk> ) of indigenous communities , teaching only Spanish and discouraging the use of indigenous languages . As a result , today there is no group of Nahuatl speakers having attained general literacy in Nahuatl ; while their literacy rate in Spanish also remains much lower than the national average . Even so , Nahuatl is still spoken by well over a million people , of whom around 10 % are monolingual . The survival of Nahuatl as a whole is not imminently endangered , but the survival of certain dialects is , and some dialects have already become extinct within the last few decades of the 20th century . 
 The 1990s saw the onset of diametric changes in official Mexican government policies towards indigenous and linguistic rights . Developments of accords in the international rights arena combined with domestic pressures ( such as social and political agitation by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and indigenous social movements ) led to legislative reforms and the creation of decentralized government agencies like National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples ( CDI ) and Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas ( <unk> ) with responsibilities for the promotion and protection of indigenous communities and languages . In particular , the federal Ley General de Derechos <unk> de los Pueblos Indígenas [ " General Law on the Language Rights of the Indigenous Peoples " , promulgated 13 March 2003 ] recognizes all the country 's indigenous languages , including Nahuatl , as " national languages " and gives indigenous people the right to use them in all spheres of public and private life . In Article 11 , it grants access to compulsory , bilingual and intercultural education . Nonetheless , progress towards institutionalizing Nahuatl and securing linguistic rights for its speakers has been slow . 
 = = Demography and distribution = = 
 Today , a spectrum of Nahuan languages are spoken in an scattered areas stretching from the northern state of Durango to Tabasco in the southeast . Pipil , the southernmost Nahuan language , is spoken in El Salvador by a small number of speakers . According to IRIN @-@ International , the <unk> Language Recovery Initiative project , there are no reliable figures for the contemporary numbers of speakers of Pipil . Numbers may range anywhere from " perhaps a few hundred people , perhaps only a few dozen " . 
 According to the 2000 census by <unk> , Nahuatl is spoken by an estimated 1 @.@ 45 million people , some 198 @,@ 000 ( 14 @.@ 9 % ) of whom are monolingual . There are many more female than male monolinguals , and females represent nearly two thirds of the total number . The states of Guerrero and Hidalgo have the highest rates of monolingual Nahuatl speakers relative to the total Nahuatl speaking population , at 24 @.@ 2 % and 22 @.@ 6 % , respectively . For most other states the percentage of monolinguals among the speakers is less than 5 % . This means that in most states more than 95 % of the Nahuatl speaking population are bilingual in Spanish . 
 The largest concentrations of Nahuatl speakers are found in the states of Puebla , Veracruz , Hidalgo , San Luis Potosí , and Guerrero . Significant populations are also found in the State of Mexico , Morelos , and the Federal District , with smaller communities in Michoacán and Durango . Nahuatl became extinct in the states of Jalisco and Colima during the 20th century . As a result of internal migrations within the country , Nahuatl speaking communities exist in all of Mexico 's states . The modern influx of Mexican workers and families into the United States has resulted in the establishment of a few small Nahuatl speaking communities in that country , particularly in California , New York , Texas , New Mexico and Arizona . 
 = = Phonology = = 
 Nahuan languages are defined as a subgroup of Uto @-@ Aztecan by having undergone a number of shared changes from the Uto @-@ Aztecan <unk> ( <unk> ) . The table below shows the phonemic inventory of Classical Nahuatl as an example of a typical Nahuan language . In some dialects , the / t ͡ ɬ / phoneme , so common in Classical Nahuatl , has changed into either / t / , as in Isthmus Nahuatl , Mexicanero and Pipil , or into / l / , as in Nahuatl of <unk> , Michoacán . Many dialects no longer distinguish between short and long vowels . Some have introduced completely new vowel qualities to compensate , as is the case for Tetelcingo Nahuatl . Others have developed a pitch accent , such as Nahuatl of <unk> , Guerrero . Many modern dialects have also borrowed phonemes from Spanish , such as / b , d , ɡ , f / . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 * The glottal phoneme , called the " saltillo , " occurs only after vowels . In many modern dialects it is realized as an [ h ] , but in others , as in Classical Nahuatl , it is a glottal stop [ ʔ ] . 
 In many Nahuatl dialects vowel length contrast is vague , and in others it has become lost entirely . The dialect of Tetelcingo ( <unk> ) developed the vowel length into a difference in quality : long / iː eː aː oː / to tense / i <unk> ɔ u / and short / i e a o / to lax / ɪ e a o / . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Most varieties have relatively simple patterns of sound alternation ( allophony ) . In many dialects , the voiced consonants are devoiced in word @-@ final position and in consonant clusters : / j / devoices to a voiceless <unk> @-@ alveolar sibilant / ʃ / , / w / devoices to a voiceless glottal fricative [ h ] or to a voiceless labialized velar approximant [ ʍ ] , and / l / devoices to voiceless alveolar lateral fricative [ ɬ ] . In some dialects , the first consonant in almost any consonant cluster becomes [ h ] . Some dialects have productive lenition of voiceless consonants into their voiced counterparts between vowels . The nasals are normally assimilated to the place of articulation of a following consonant . The voiceless alveolar lateral affricate [ t ͡ ɬ ] is assimilated after / l / and pronounced [ l ] . 
 = = = Phonotactics = = = 
 Classical Nahuatl and most of the modern varieties have fairly simple phonological systems . They allow only syllables with maximally one initial and one final consonant . Consonant clusters occur only word @-@ medially and over syllable boundaries . Some morphemes have two alternating forms : one with a vowel i to prevent consonant clusters and one without it . For example , the absolutive suffix has the variant forms <unk> ( used after consonants ) and <unk> ( used after vowels ) . Some modern varieties , however , have formed complex clusters from vowel loss . Others have contracted syllable sequences , causing accents to shift or vowels to become long . 
 = = = Stress = = = 
 Most Nahuatl dialects have stress on the penultimate syllable of a word . In Mexicanero from Durango , many unstressed syllables have disappeared from words , and the placement of syllable stress has become phonemic . 
 = = Morphology and Syntax = = 
 The Nahuatl languages are agglutinative , polysynthetic languages that make extensive use of compounding , incorporation and derivation . That is , they can add many different prefixes and suffixes to a root until very long words are formed , and a single word can constitute an entire sentence . 
 The following verb shows how the verb is marked for subject , patient , object , and indirect object : 
 / ni @-@ <unk> @-@ teː @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ s / 
 I @-@ you @-@ someone @-@ something @-@ give @-@ <unk> @-@ FUTURE 
 " I shall make somebody give something to you " ( Classical Nahuatl ) 
 = = = Nouns = = = 
 The Nahuatl noun has a relatively complex structure . The only obligatory inflections are for number ( singular and plural ) and possession ( whether the noun is possessed , as is indicated by a prefix meaning ' my ' , ' your ' , etc . ) . Nahuatl has neither case nor gender , but Classical Nahuatl and some modern dialects distinguish between animate and inanimate nouns . In Classical Nahuatl the animacy distinction manifested with respect to <unk> , as only animate nouns could take a plural form , and all inanimate nouns were uncountable ( as the words " bread " and " money " are uncountable in English ) . Now , many speakers do not maintain this distinction and all nouns may take the plural inflection . One dialect , that of the Eastern Huasteca , has a distinction between two different plural suffixes for animate and inanimate nouns . 
 In most varieties of Nahuatl , nouns in the <unk> singular form generally take an " absolutive " suffix . The most common forms of the absolutive are <unk> after vowels , <unk> after consonants other than l , and -li after l . Nouns that take the plural usually form the plural by adding one of the plural absolutive suffixes <unk> or <unk> , but some plural forms are irregular or formed by reduplication . Some nouns have competing plural forms . 
 Plural animate noun <unk> reduplication : 
 / <unk> ~ <unk> @-@ ʔ / 
 PLURAL ~ coyote @-@ PLURAL 
 " coyotes " ( Classical Nahuatl ) 
 Nahuatl distinguishes between possessed and <unk> forms of nouns . The absolutive suffix is not used on possessed nouns . In all dialects , possessed nouns take a prefix agreeing with number and person of its possessor . Possessed plural nouns take the ending - / <unk> / . 
 Possessed plural : 
 / no @-@ kal @-@ <unk> / 
 my @-@ house @-@ PLURAL 
 " my houses " ( Classical Nahuatl ) 
 Nahuatl does not have grammatical case but uses what is sometimes called a relational noun to describe spatial ( and other ) relations . These morphemes cannot appear alone but must occur after a noun or a possessive prefix . They are also often called postpositions or locative <unk> in some ways these locative constructions resemble and can be thought of as locative case constructions . Most modern dialects have incorporated prepositions from Spanish that are competing with or that have completely replaced relational nouns . 
 Noun compounds are commonly formed by combining two or more nominal stems or combining a nominal stem with an adjectival or verbal stem . 
 = = = Pronouns = = = 
 Nahuatl generally distinguishes three persons , both in the singular and plural numbers . In at least one modern dialect , the Isthmus @-@ <unk> variety , there has come to be a distinction between inclusive ( I / we and you ) and exclusive ( we but not you ) forms of the first person plural : 
 Much more common is an honorific / non @-@ honorific distinction , usually applied to second and third persons but not first . 
 = = = Verbs = = = 
 The Nahuatl verb is quite complex and inflects for many grammatical categories . The verb is composed of a root , prefixes , and suffixes . The prefixes indicate the person of the subject , and person and number of the object and indirect object , whereas the suffixes indicate tense , aspect , mood and subject number . 
 Most Nahuatl dialects distinguish three tenses : present , past , and future , and two aspects : perfective and imperfective . Some varieties add progressive or habitual aspects . Many dialects distinguish at least the indicative and imperative moods , and some also have optative and <unk> / prohibitive moods . 
 Most Nahuatl varieties have a number of ways to alter the valency of a verb . Classical Nahuatl had a passive voice ( also sometimes defined as an impersonal voice ) , but this is not found in most modern varieties . However the <unk> and causative voices are found in many modern dialects . Many Nahuatl varieties also allow forming verbal compounds with two or more verbal roots . 
 The following verbal form has two verbal roots and is inflected for causative voice and both a direct and indirect object : 
 ni @-@ kin @-@ <unk> @-@ kwa @-@ <unk> @-@ s @-@ <unk> 
 I @-@ them @-@ something @-@ eat @-@ <unk> @-@ FUTURE @-@ want 
 " I want to feed them " ( Classical Nahuatl ) 
 Some Nahuatl varieties , notably Classical Nahuatl , can inflect the verb to show the direction of the verbal action going away from or towards the speaker . Some also have specific inflectional categories showing purpose and direction and such complex notions as " to go in order to " or " to come in order to " , " go , do and return " , " do while going " , " do while coming " , " do upon arrival " , or " go around doing " . 
 Classical Nahuatl and many modern dialects have <unk> ways to express politeness towards addressees or even towards people or things that are being mentioned , by using special verb forms and special " honorific suffixes " . 
 = = = Reduplication = = = 
 Many varieties of Nahuatl have productive reduplication . By <unk> the first syllable of a root a new word is formed . In nouns this is often used to form plurals , e.g. / <unk> / " man " → / <unk> / " men " , but also in some varieties to form diminutives , honorifics , or for derivations . In verbs reduplication is often used to form a <unk> meaning ( i.e. expressing repetition ) , for example in Nahuatl of <unk> : 
 / <unk> / " he / she falls " 
 / we : <unk> / " he / she falls several times " 
 / <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ ʔ / " they fall ( many people ) " 
 = = = Syntax = = = 
 Some linguists have argued that Nahuatl displays the properties of a non @-@ <unk> language , meaning that word order in Nahuatl is basically free . Nahuatl allows all possible orderings of the three basic sentence constituents . It is prolifically a pro @-@ drop language : it allows sentences with omission of all noun phrases or independent pronouns , not just of noun phrases or pronouns whose function is the sentence subject . In most varieties independent pronouns are used only for emphasis . It allows certain kinds of syntactically discontinuous expressions . 
 Michel <unk> argues that Classical Nahuatl had a verb @-@ initial basic word order with extensive freedom for variation , which was then used to encode pragmatic functions such as focus and topicality . The same has been argued for some contemporary varieties . 
 <unk> no @-@ <unk> 
 I my @-@ fianceé 
 " My fiancée " ( and not anyone else 's ) ( Michoacán Nahual ) 
 It has been argued that Classical Nahuatl syntax is best characterised by " <unk> " , meaning that any noun or verb in the language is in fact a full predicative sentence . A radical interpretation of Nahuatl syntactic typology , this nonetheless seems to account for some of the language 's peculiarities , for example , why nouns must also carry the same agreement prefixes as verbs , and why predicates do not require any noun phrases to function as their arguments . For example , the verbal form <unk> means " he / she / it shouts " , and with the second person prefix <unk> it means " you shout " . Nouns are inflected in the same way : the noun " <unk> " means not just " child " , but also " it is a child " , and <unk> means " you are a child " . This prompts the <unk> interpretation , which posits that all nouns are also predicates . According to this interpretation a phrase such as <unk> in <unk> should not be interpreted as meaning just " the child screams " but , rather , " it screams , ( the one that ) is a child " . 
 = = Contact phenomena = = 
 Nearly 500 years of intense contact between speakers of Nahuatl and speakers of Spanish , combined with the minority status of Nahuatl and the higher prestige associated with Spanish has caused many changes in modern Nahuatl varieties , with large numbers of words borrowed from Spanish into Nahuatl , and the introduction of new syntactic constructions and grammatical categories . 
 For example , a construction like the following , with several borrowed words and particles , is common in many modern varieties ( Spanish loanwords in boldface ) : 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> lo que <unk> <unk> en mexicano 
 but not they @-@ us @-@ understand @-@ PLURAL that which what we @-@ it @-@ say in Nahuatl 
 " But they don 't understand what we say in Nahuatl " ( Malinche Nahuatl ) 
 In some modern dialects basic word order has become a fixed subject – verb – object , probably under influence from Spanish . Other changes in the syntax of modern Nahuatl include the use of Spanish prepositions instead of native postpositions or relational nouns and the reinterpretation of original postpositions / relational nouns into prepositions . In the following example , from Michoacán Nahual , the postposition <unk> meaning " with " appears used as a preposition , with no preceding object : 
 ti @-@ ya ti @-@ k @-@ <unk> ka tel 
 you @-@ go you @-@ it @-@ carry with you 
 " are you going to carry it with you ? " ( Michoacán Nahual ) 
 In this example from Mexicanero <unk> , of Durango , the original postposition / relational noun <unk> " in / on " is used as a preposition . Also , " <unk> " , a conjunction borrowed from Spanish , occurs in the sentence . 
 amo wel <unk> @-@ <unk> pin kal <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> im <unk> 
 not can he @-@ enter @-@ PAST in house because it @-@ closed @-@ was the door 
 " He couldn 't enter the house because the door was closed " ( Mexicanero <unk> ) 
 Many dialects have also undergone a degree of simplification of their morphology that has caused some scholars to consider them to have ceased to be polysynthetic . 
 = = Vocabulary = = 
 Many Nahuatl words have been borrowed into the Spanish language , most of which are terms designating things indigenous to the American continent . Some of these loans are restricted to Mexican or Central American Spanish , but others have entered all the varieties of Spanish in the world . A number of them , such as " chocolate " , " tomato " and " avocado " have made their way into many other languages via Spanish . 
 Likewise a number of English words have been borrowed from Nahuatl through Spanish . Two of the most prominent are undoubtedly chocolate and tomato ( from Nahuatl <unk> ) . Other common words such as coyote ( from Nahuatl <unk> ) , avocado ( from Nahuatl <unk> ) and chile or chili ( from Nahuatl chilli ) . The word chicle is also derived from Nahuatl <unk> " sticky stuff , chicle " . Some other English words from Nahuatl are : Aztec ( from <unk> ) ; cacao ( from Nahuatl <unk> ' shell , rind ' ) ; ocelot ( from <unk> ) . In Mexico many words for common everyday concepts attest to the close contact between Spanish and Nahuatl , so many in fact that entire dictionaries of " <unk> " ( words particular to Mexican Spanish ) have been published tracing Nahuatl etymologies , as well as Spanish words with origins in other indigenous languages . Many well known toponyms also come from Nahuatl , including Mexico ( from the Nahuatl word for the Aztec capital <unk> ) and Guatemala ( from the word <unk> ) . 
 = = Writing and literature = = 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Traditionally , Pre @-@ Columbian Aztec writing has not been considered a true writing system , since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language in the way that the writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did . Therefore , generally Aztec writing was not meant to be read , but to be told . The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts , which include genealogies , astronomical information , and tribute lists . Three kinds of signs were used in the system : pictures used as mnemonics ( which do not represent particular words ) , logograms which represent whole words ( instead of phonemes or syllables ) , and logograms used only for their sound values ( i.e. used according to the rebus principle ) . However , epigrapher Alfonso <unk> has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion , one school of Nahua scribes , those of <unk> , had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically in the same way that the Maya script did . Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim , arguing that although the <unk> was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts ( hardly any pre @-@ Columbian manuscripts have survived ) , this could be interpreted as a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a continuation of a pre @-@ Columbian practice . 
 The Spanish introduced the Latin script , which was used to record a large body of Aztec prose , poetry and mundane documentation such as testaments , administrative documents , legal letters , etc . In a matter of decades pictorial writing was completely replaced with the Latin alphabet . No standardized Latin orthography has been developed for Nahuatl , and no general consensus has arisen for the representation of many sounds in Nahuatl that are lacking in Spanish , such as long vowels and the glottal stop . The orthography most accurately representing the phonemes of Nahuatl was developed in the 17th century by the Jesuit Horacio Carochi , building on the insights of another Jesuit , Antonio del Rincon . Carochi 's orthography used two different diacritics : a <unk> to represent long vowels and a grave for the saltillo , and sometimes an acute accent for short vowels . This orthography did not achieve a wide following outside of the Jesuit community . 
 When Nahuatl became the subject of focused linguistic studies in the 20th century , linguists acknowledged the need to represent all the phonemes of the language . Several practical orthographies were developed to transcribe the language , many using the Americanist transcription system . With the establishment of Mexico 's Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas in 2004 , new attempts to create standardized orthographies for the different dialects were resumed ; however to this day there is no single official orthography for Nahuatl . Apart from dialectal differences , major issues in transcribing Nahuatl include : 
 whether to follow Spanish orthographic practice and write / k / with c and qu , / kʷ / with cu and <unk> , / s / with c and z , or s , and / w / with hu and uh , or u . 
 how to write the " saltillo " phoneme ( in some dialects pronounced as a glottal stop [ ʔ ] and in others as an [ h ] ) , which has been spelled with j , h , ’ ( apostrophe ) , or a grave accent on the preceding vowel , but which traditionally has often been omitted in writing . 
 whether and how to represent vowel length , e.g. by double vowels or by the use of <unk> . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 Among the indigenous languages of the Americas , the extensive corpus of surviving literature in Nahuatl dating as far back as the 16th century may be considered unique . Nahuatl literature encompasses a diverse array of genres and styles , the documents themselves composed under many different circumstances . It appears that the <unk> Nahua had a distinction much like the European distinction between " prose " and " poetry " , the first called <unk> " speech " and the second <unk> " song " . 
 Nahuatl <unk> prose has been preserved in different forms . Annals and chronicles recount history , normally written from the perspective of a particular <unk> ( locally based polity ) and often combining mythical accounts with real events . Important works in this genre include those from Chalco written by Chimalpahin , from Tlaxcala by Diego Muñoz Camargo , from Mexico @-@ Tenochtitlan by Fernando Alvarado Tezozomoc and those of Texcoco by Fernando Alva <unk> . Many annals recount history year @-@ by @-@ year and are normally written by anonymous authors . These works are sometimes evidently based on pre @-@ Columbian pictorial year counts that existed , such as the <unk> annals and the Anales de <unk> . Purely mythological narratives are also found , like the " Legend of the Five Suns " , the Aztec creation myth recounted in Codex <unk> . 
 One of the most important works of prose written in Nahuatl is the twelve @-@ volume compilation generally known as the Florentine Codex , produced in the mid @-@ 16th century by the Franciscan missionary Bernardino de Sahagún with the help of a number of Nahua informants . With this work Sahagún bestowed an enormous ethnographic description of the Nahua , written in side @-@ by @-@ side translations of Nahuatl and Spanish and illustrated throughout by color plates drawn by indigenous painters . Its volumes cover a diverse range of topics : Aztec history , material culture , social organization , religious and ceremonial life , rhetorical style and metaphors . The twelfth volume provides an indigenous perspective on the conquest itself . Sahagún also made a point of trying to document the richness of the Nahuatl language , stating : 
 This work is like a dragnet to bring to light all the words of this language with their exact and metaphorical meanings , and all their ways of speaking , and most of their practices good and evil . 
 Nahuatl poetry is preserved in principally two sources : the <unk> Mexicanos and the Romances de los <unk> de Nueva España , both collections of Aztec songs written down in the 16th and 17th centuries . Some songs may have been preserved through oral tradition from pre @-@ conquest times until the time of their writing , for example the songs attributed to the poet @-@ king of Texcoco , <unk> . Karttunen & Lockhart ( 1980 ) identify more than four distinct styles of songs , e.g. the <unk> ( " sad song " ) , the <unk> ( " song of spring " ) , <unk> ( " plain song " ) and <unk> ( " song of war " ) , each with distinct stylistic traits . Aztec poetry makes rich use of metaphoric imagery and themes and are lamentation of the brevity of human existence , the celebration of valiant warriors who die in battle , and the appreciation of the beauty of life . 
 = = = Stylistics = = = 
 The Aztecs distinguished between at least two social registers of language : the language of commoners ( <unk> ) and the language of the nobility ( <unk> ) . The latter was marked by the use of a distinct rhetorical style . Since literacy was confined mainly to these higher social classes , most of the existing prose and poetical documents were written in this style . An important feature of this high rhetorical style of formal oratory was the use of parallelism , whereby the orator structured their speech in couplets consisting of two parallel phrases . For example : 
 ye <unk> <unk> 
 " May we not die " 
 ye <unk> <unk> 
 " May we not perish " 
 Another kind of parallelism used is referred to by modern linguists as <unk> , in which two phrases are symbolically combined to give a metaphorical reading . Classical Nahuatl was rich in such <unk> metaphors , many of which are explicated by Sahagún in the Florentine Codex and by Andrés de Olmos in his Arte . Such <unk> include : 
 in <unk> , in <unk> 
 " The flower , the song " – meaning " poetry " 
 in <unk> , in <unk> 
 " the tail , the wing " – meaning " the common people " 
 in <unk> , in <unk> 
 " the chest , the box " – meaning " something secret " 
 in <unk> , in <unk> 
 " the heart , the blood " – meaning " cacao " 
 in <unk> , in <unk> 
 " the drool , the spittle " – meaning " lies "

 = George Martin = 
 Sir George Henry Martin CBE ( 3 January 1926 – 8 March 2016 ) was an English record producer , arranger , composer , conductor , audio engineer and musician . He was referred to as the " Fifth Beatle " , including by Paul McCartney , in reference to his extensive involvement on each of the Beatles ' original albums . Martin had 30 number @-@ one hit singles in the United Kingdom and 23 number @-@ one hits in the United States . 
 Martin produced comedy and novelty records in the early 1950s , working with Peter Sellers , Spike Milligan and Bernard Cribbins , among others . His career spanned more than six decades of work in music , film , television and live performance . He held a number of senior executive roles at media companies and contributed to a wide range of charitable causes , including his work for The Prince 's Trust and the Caribbean island of Montserrat . In recognition of his services to the music industry and popular culture , he was made a Knight Bachelor in 1996 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 When he was six , Martin 's family acquired a piano that sparked his interest in music . At eight years of age , Martin persuaded his parents , Henry and <unk> Beatrice ( <unk> Simpson ) Martin , that he should take piano lessons , but those ended after only eight lessons because of a disagreement between his mother and the teacher . 
 As a child , he attended several schools , including a " convent school in Holloway " , St Joseph 's School ( Highgate ) , and at St Ignatius ' College ( Stamford Hill ) , where he had won a scholarship . When WWII broke out , and St. Ignatius College students were evacuated to Welwyn Garden City , his family left London , and he was enrolled at Bromley Grammar School . 
 I remember well the very first time I heard a symphony orchestra . I was just in my teens when Sir Adrian Boult brought the BBC Symphony Orchestra to my school for a public concert . It was absolutely magical . Hearing such glorious sounds I found it difficult to connect them with ninety men and women blowing into brass and wooden instruments or scraping away at strings with horsehair bows . 
 Despite Martin 's continued interest in music , and " fantasies about being the next Rachmaninov " , he did not initially choose music as a career . He worked briefly as a quantity surveyor , and later for the War Office as a Temporary Clerk ( Grade Three ) , which meant filing paperwork and making tea . 
 In 1943 , when he was seventeen , he joined the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy and became an aerial observer and a commissioned officer . The war ended before Martin was involved in any combat , and he left the service in 1947 . Encouraged by Sidney Harrison ( a member of the Committee for the Promotion of New Music ) Martin used his veteran 's grant to attend the Guildhall School of Music and Drama from 1947 to 1950 , where he studied piano and oboe , and was interested in the music of Rachmaninov and Ravel , as well as Cole Porter . Martin 's oboe teacher was Margaret Eliot ( the mother of Jane Asher , who would later become involved with Paul McCartney ) . After that , Martin explained that he had just picked it up by himself . On 3 January 1948 – while still at the Academy – Martin married Sheena Chisholm , with whom he had two children , Alexis and Gregory Paul Martin . He later married Judy Lockhart @-@ Smith on 24 June 1966 , and they also had two children , Lucie and Giles Martin . 
 = = = Parlophone = = = 
 Following his graduation , he worked for the BBC 's classical music department , then joined EMI in 1950 , as an assistant to Oscar Preuss , the head of EMI 's Parlophone Records from 1950 to 1955 . Although having been regarded by EMI as a vital German imprint in the past , it was then not taken seriously and only used for EMI 's insignificant acts . After taking over Parlophone when Preuss retired in 1955 , Martin recorded classical and Baroque music , original cast recordings , and regional music from around Britain and Ireland . 
 Martin also produced numerous comedy and novelty records . His first hit for Parlophone was the " Mock Mozart " single by Peter Ustinov with Antony Hopkins – a record reluctantly released in 1952 by EMI , only after Preuss insisted they give his young assistant , Martin , a chance . Later that decade Martin worked with Peter Sellers on two very popular comedy LPs . One was released on 10 format and called The Best Of Sellers , the second was released in 1957 , being called Songs for Swinging Sellers ( a spoof on Frank Sinatra 's LP Songs for Swingin ' Lovers ! ) . As he had worked with Sellers , he also came to know Spike Milligan , with whom he became a firm friend , and best man at Milligan 's second marriage : " I loved The Goon Show , and issued an album of it on my label Parlophone , which is how I got to know Spike . " The album was Bridge on the River Wye . It was a spoof of the film The Bridge on the River Kwai , being based on the 1957 Goon Show episode " An African Incident " . It was intended to have the same name as the film , but shortly before its release , the film company threatened legal action if the name was used . Martin edited out the ' K ' every time the word Kwai was spoken , with Bridge on the River Wye being the result . The River Wye is a river that runs through England and Wales . The album featured Milligan , Sellers , Jonathan Miller and Peter Cook , playing various characters . 
 Other comedians Martin worked with included Bernard Cribbins , Charlie Drake , Terry Scott , Bruce Forsyth , Michael Bentine , Dudley Moore , Flanders and Swann , Lance Percival , Joan Sims , Bill Oddie , and The Alberts . Martin worked with both Jim Dale and the Vipers Skiffle Group , with whom he had a number of hits . In early 1962 , under the pseudonym " Ray Cathode " , Martin released an early electronic dance single , " Time Beat " – recorded at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop . As Martin wanted to add rock and roll to Parlophone 's repertoire , he struggled to find a " fireproof " hit @-@ making pop artist or group . Martin also became involved with engineering — producing some of the recorded material of Australian hit @-@ maker Rolf Harris , and is alleged to have been responsible for the close @-@ miking of the " wobble @-@ board " sound that became an audio trade @-@ mark of Harris on several of his hit songs , including his only international hit , " Tie Me Kangaroo Down , Sport " ( 1960 – 1961 ) . Martin was credited as an engineer on some of Harris ' albums . 
 As a producer , Martin recorded the two @-@ man show featuring Michael Flanders and Donald Swann , At the Drop of a Hat , which sold steadily for twenty @-@ five years , although Martin 's breakthrough as a producer came with the Beyond the Fringe show cast album , which starred Peter Cook , Dudley Moore , Alan Bennett , and Jonathan Miller , and he would also produce the accompanying soundtrack album for David Frost 's satirical BBC TV show That Was the Week That Was in 1963 . Martin 's work transformed the profile of Parlophone from a " sad little company " to a very profitable business . 
 = = The Beatles = = 
 Martin was contacted by Sid Coleman of Ardmore & Beechwood , who told him about Brian Epstein , the manager of a band whom he had met . He thought Martin might be interested in the group , even though they had been turned down by Decca Records . Until that time , although he had had considerable success with the comedy records , and a number 1 hit with the Temperance Seven , Martin had only minor success with pop music , such as " Who Could Be Bluer " by Jerry <unk> , and singles with Shane Fenton and Matt Monro . After the telephone call by Coleman , Martin arranged a meeting on 13 February 1962 with Brian Epstein . Martin listened to a tape recorded at Decca , and thought that Epstein 's group was " rather unpromising " , but liked the sound of Lennon 's and McCartney 's vocals . 
 After another meeting with Epstein on 9 May at the Abbey Road studios , Martin was impressed by Epstein 's enthusiasm and agreed to sign the unknown Beatles to a recording contract , without having met them or seen them play live . The contract was not what it seemed , however , as Martin would not sign it himself until he had heard an audition , and later said that EMI had " nothing to lose , " as it offered one penny for each record sold , which was split among the four members . Martin suggested to EMI ( after the release of " From Me to You " ) that the royalty rate should be doubled without asking for anything in return , which led to Martin being thought of as a " traitor in EMI " . 
 The Beatles auditioned for Martin on 6 June 1962 , in studio three at the Abbey Road studios . Ron Richards and his engineer Norman Smith recorded four songs , which Martin ( who was not present during the recording ) listened to at the end of the session . The verdict was not promising , however , as Richards complained about Pete Best 's drumming , and Martin thought their original songs were simply not good enough . Martin asked the individual Beatles if there was anything they personally did not like , to which George Harrison replied , " Well , there 's your tie , for a start . " That was the turning point , according to Smith , as John Lennon and Paul McCartney joined in with jokes and comic wordplay , that made Martin think that he should sign them to a contract for their wit alone . 
 The Beatles ' second recording session with Martin was on 4 September 1962 , when they recorded " How Do You Do It " , heavily modified by The Beatles which Martin thought was a sure @-@ fire hit , even though Lennon and McCartney did not want to release it , not being one of their own compositions or style . Martin was correct : Gerry & the Pacemakers ' version , which Martin produced , spent three weeks at No. 1 in April 1963 , before being displaced by " From Me to You " . On 11 September 1962 , the Beatles re @-@ recorded " Love Me Do " with session player Andy White playing drums . Ringo Starr was asked to play tambourine and maracas , and although he complied , he was definitely " not pleased " . Due to an EMI library error , a 4 September version with Starr playing drums was issued on the British single release ; afterwards , the tape was destroyed , and the 11 September recording with Andy White on drums was used for all subsequent releases . Martin would later praise Starr 's drumming , calling him " probably ... the finest rock drummer in the world today " . As " Love Me Do " peaked at number 17 in the British charts , on 26 November 1962 Martin recorded " Please Please Me " , which he did only after Lennon and McCartney had almost begged him to record another of their original songs . Martin 's crucial contribution to the song was to tell them to speed up what was initially a slow ballad . After the recording Martin looked over the mixing desk and said , " Gentlemen , you have just made your first number one record " . Martin directed Epstein to find a good publisher , as Ardmore & Beechwood had done nothing to promote " Love Me Do " , informing Epstein of three publishers who , in Martin 's opinion , would be fair and honest , which led them to Dick James . 
 = = = As an arranger = = = 
 Martin 's more formal musical expertise helped fill the gaps between the Beatles ' unrefined talent , and the sound which distinguished them from other groups , which would eventually make them successful . Most of the Beatles ' orchestral arrangements and instrumentation ( as well as frequent keyboard parts on the early records ) were written or performed by Martin , in collaboration with the less musically experienced band . It was Martin 's idea to put a string quartet on " Yesterday " , against McCartney 's initial reluctance . Martin played the song in the style of Bach to show McCartney the voicings that were available . Another example is the song " Penny Lane " , which featured a piccolo trumpet solo . McCartney hummed the melody he wanted , and Martin notated it for David Mason , the classically trained trumpeter . 
 His work as an arranger was used for many Beatles recordings . For " Eleanor Rigby " he scored and conducted a strings @-@ only accompaniment inspired by Bernard Herrmann . On a Canadian speaking tour in 2007 , Martin said his " Eleanor Rigby " score was influenced by Herrmann 's score for the Alfred Hitchcock thriller , Psycho . For " Strawberry Fields Forever " , he and recording engineer Geoff Emerick turned two very different takes into a single master through careful use of vari @-@ speed and editing . For " I Am the Walrus " , he provided a quirky and original arrangement for brass , violins , cellos , and the Mike Sammes Singers vocal ensemble . On " In My Life " , he played a speeded @-@ up baroque piano solo . He worked with McCartney to implement the orchestral ' climax ' in " A Day in the Life " , and he and McCartney shared conducting duties the day it was recorded . 
 Martin contributed integral parts to other songs , including the piano in " Lovely Rita " , the harpsichord in " Fixing a Hole " , the organs and tape loop arrangement that create the Pablo Fanque circus atmosphere that Lennon requested on " Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite ! " ( both Martin and Lennon played organ parts for this song ) , and the orchestration in " Good Night " . The first song that Martin did not arrange was " She 's Leaving Home " , as he had a prior engagement to produce a Cilla Black session , so McCartney contacted arranger Mike Leander to do it . Martin was reportedly hurt by this , but still produced the recording and conducted the orchestra himself . Martin was in demand as an independent arranger and producer by the time of The White Album , so the Beatles were left to produce various tracks by themselves . 
 Martin arranged the score for the Beatles ' film Yellow Submarine and the James Bond film Live and Let Die , for which Paul McCartney wrote and sang the title song . He helped arrange Paul and Linda McCartney 's American Number 1 single " Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey " . 
 Paul McCartney once commended Martin by saying : " George Martin [ was ] quite experimental for who he was , a grown @-@ up . " 
 = = = Film and composing work = = = 
 Beginning in the late 1950s , Martin began to supplement his producer income by publishing music and having his artists record it . He used the pseudonyms <unk> Anales and John Chisholm , before settling on Graham Fisher as his primary pseudonym . 
 Martin composed , arranged , and produced film scores since the early 1960s , including the instrumental scores of the films A Hard Day 's Night ( 1964 , for which he won an Academy Award Nomination ) , Ferry Cross the Mersey ( 1965 ) , Yellow Submarine ( 1968 ) , and Live and Let Die ( 1973 ) . Other notable movie scores include Crooks Anonymous ( 1962 ) , The Family Way ( 1966 ) , Pulp ( 1972 , starring Michael Caine and Mickey Rooney ) , the Peter Sellers film The Optimists of Nine Elms ( 1973 ) , and the John Schlesinger directed Honky Tonk Freeway ( 1981 ) . 
 He also composed the David Frost theme " By George " , " <unk> @-@ <unk> " ( the theme from the 1970 LWT horror series Tales of Unease ) , " Theme One " for BBC Radio 1 , " Adagietto for Harmonica & Strings " for Tommy Reilly , and " Magic Carpet " for the Dakotas . 
 = = = The Beatles Anthology = = = 
 Martin oversaw post @-@ production on The Beatles Anthology ( which was originally entitled The Long and Winding Road ) in 1994 and 1995 , working again with Geoff Emerick . Martin decided to use an old 8 @-@ track analogue deck – which EMI learned an engineer still had – to mix the songs for the project , instead of a modern digital deck . He explained this by saying that the old deck created a completely different sound , which a new deck could not accurately reproduce . He also said he found the whole project a strange experience ( and McCartney agreed ) , as they had to listen to themselves chatting in the studio , 25 – 30 years previously . 
 Martin stepped down when it came to producing the two new singles reuniting McCartney , Harrison , and Starr , who wanted to overdub two old Lennon demos . Martin had suffered a hearing loss , so he left the work to writer / producer Jeff Lynne of the Electric Light Orchestra . 
 = = = Cirque du Soleil and Love = = = 
 In 2006 , Martin and his son , Giles Martin , remixed 80 minutes of Beatles music for the Las Vegas stage performance Love , a joint venture between Cirque du Soleil and the Beatles ' Apple Corps Ltd . A soundtrack album from the show was released that same year . 
 = = = Public image = = = 
 Martin 's contribution to the Beatles ' work received regular critical acclaim , and led to him being described as the " Fifth Beatle " ( in 2016 , Paul McCartney wrote that " If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George " ) . However , he distanced himself from this claim , stating that assistant and roadie Neil Aspinall would be more deserving of that title . 
 In the immediate aftermath of the Beatles ' break @-@ up , a time when he made many angry utterances , John Lennon trivialised Martin 's importance to the Beatles ' music . In his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner , Lennon said , " [ Dick James is ] another one of those people , who think they made us . They didn 't . I 'd like to hear Dick James ' music and I 'd like to hear George Martin 's music , please , just play me some . " 
 In a 1971 letter to Paul McCartney , Lennon wrote , " When people ask me questions about ' What did George Martin really do for you ? , ' I have only one answer , ' What does he do now ? ' I noticed you had no answer for that ! It 's not a putdown , it 's the truth . " Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles ' music . Commenting specifically on " Revolution 9 " , Lennon said with ironic authority , " For Martin to state that he was ' painting a sound picture ' is pure hallucination . Ask any of the other people involved . The final editing Yoko and I did alone . " 
 Lennon later retracted many of the comments he made in that era , attributing them to his anger . He subsequently spoke with great affection and fondness for Martin . In 1971 he said : " George Martin made us what we were in the studio . He helped us develop a language to talk to other musicians . " 
 According to Alan Parsons , he had " great ears " and " rightfully earned the title of " Fifth Beatle " . Julian Lennon called Martin " The Fifth Beatle , without question " . 
 = = Other artists = = 
 Martin produced recordings for many other artists , including contemporaries of the Beatles , such as Matt Monro , Cilla Black , Gerry & The Pacemakers , Billy J. Kramer & the Dakotas , The Fourmost , David and Jonathan , and The Action , as well as The King 's Singers , the band America , guitarists Jeff Beck and John Williams , sixties duo Edwards Hand , Gary Brooker , Neil Sedaka , Ultravox , country singer Kenny Rogers , UFO , Cheap Trick , Elton John , Celine Dion and Yoshiki Hayashi of X Japan . 
 Also working with Gary Glitter before his chart success , Martin recorded several songs with him in the early 1960s , with the singer using the pseudonym of " Paul Raven " . He also produced the album The Man in the Bowler Hat ( 1974 ) for the eccentric British folk @-@ rock group Stackridge . Martin worked with Paul Winter on his ( 1972 ) Icarus album , which was recorded in a rented house by the sea in Marblehead , Massachusetts . Winter said that Martin taught him " how to use the studio as a tool " , and allowed him to record the album in a relaxed atmosphere , which was different from the pressurised control in a professional studio . In 1979 he worked with Ron Goodwin to produce the album containing The Beatles Concerto , written by John Rutter . In 2010 , Martin was the executive producer of the hard rock debut of Arms of the Sun , an all @-@ star project featuring Rex Brown ( Pantera , Down ) , John Luke Hebert ( King Diamond ) , Lance <unk> and Ben Bunker . 
 In 1991 , Martin contributed the string arrangement and conducted the orchestra for the song " Ticket To Heaven " on the last Dire Straits studio album On Every Street . In 1992 , Martin worked with Pete Townshend on the musical stage production of The Who 's Tommy . The play opened on Broadway in 1993 , with the original cast album being released that summer . Martin won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album in 1993 , as the producer of that album . 
 In 1995 , he contributed the horn and string arrangement for the song " Latitude " on the Elton John Made in England album , which was recorded at Martin 's AIR Studios London . He also produced " Candle in the Wind 1997 " , Elton 's tribute single to the late Diana , Princess of Wales , which topped charts around the world in September 1997 . 
 = = Associated Independent Recording ( AIR ) = = 
 Within the recording industry , Martin was known for having become independent at a time when many producers were still salaried . In 1965 , the Beatles ' success gave Martin the leverage to start Associated Independent Recording ( AIR ) , which enabled him to hire out his services to other artists . AIR demonstrated how important Martin 's talents were to his artists , and it allowed him a share in record royalties on his hits . To this day , AIR remains one of the world 's pre @-@ eminent recording studios . In 1979 , Martin opened a studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat . This studio was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo ten years later .

 Martin also directly and indirectly contributed to the main themes of three films in the James Bond series . Although Martin did not produce the theme for the second Bond film , From Russia with Love , he was responsible for the signing of Matt Monro to EMI , just months prior to his recording of the song of the same title . 
 Martin also produced two of the best @-@ known James Bond themes . The first was " Goldfinger " by Shirley Bassey in 1964 . The second , in 1973 , was " Live and Let Die " by Paul McCartney and Wings for the film of the same name . He also composed and produced the film 's score .

 In 1979 , Martin published a memoir , All You Need is Ears ( co @-@ written with Jeremy Hornsby ) , that described his work with the Beatles and other artists ( including Peter Sellers , Sophia Loren , Shirley Bassey , Flanders and Swann , Matt Monro , and Dudley Moore ) , and gave an informal introduction to the art and science of sound recording . In 1993 he published Summer of Love : The Making of Sgt Pepper ( published in the U.S. as With a Little Help from My Friends : The Making of Sgt Pepper , co @-@ authored with William Pearson ) , which also included interview quotations from a 1992 South Bank Show episode discussing the album .

 = Myst IV : Revelation = 
 Myst IV : Revelation is the fourth installment in the Myst computer game series , developed and published by Ubisoft . Revelation was the first game in the series released exclusively on a DVD @-@ ROM format ; a multiple CD @-@ ROM version was not produced as it would have taken twelve compact discs to fit all the data . Like Myst III : Exile , Revelation combines pre @-@ rendered graphics with digital video , but also features real @-@ time 3D effects for added realism . 
 The plot of Revelation ties up loose ends from the original Myst . The player is summoned by Atrus , a man who creates links to other worlds known as Ages by writing special linking books . Almost twenty years earlier , Atrus ' two sons nearly destroyed all of his linking books and were imprisoned ; Atrus now wishes to see if his sons ' imprisonment has reformed them . The player ends up traveling to each brother 's prison , in an effort to recover Atrus ' daughter Yeesha from the brothers ' plot . 
 Development of Revelation lasted more than three years ; Ubisoft had as many as eighty employees working on the game . Musician Peter Gabriel lent his voice and a song to the game 's audio ; the original score was written by Exile 's composer Jack Wall . Overall , reception to the game was positive ; reviewers lauded the impressive visuals , sound , and puzzles . Publications such as Computer Gaming World took issue with the control scheme of the game . Revelation is the last game in the Myst series to use both prerendered backgrounds and full @-@ motion video ; the final game in the series , End of Ages , is rendered in real @-@ time throughout . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Myst IV : Revelation is an adventure game in which the player experiences gameplay from the eyes of an unnamed protagonist referred to as the Stranger . Players explore interactive worlds known as Ages by using the mouse or keyboard , solving puzzles and uncovering the game 's narrative . Players cannot move freely across each Age ; instead , as in the previous games in the Myst series , they travel by clicking set locations called " nodes " , where players can rotate their view in any direction . Revelation also features a " Zip " mode , which allows a method of rapidly crossing explored areas by skipping intermediate nodes ; areas that can be instantly traveled to are stored as thumbnail representations for rapid movement across Ages . 
 The mouse cursor helps to provide visual cues for player actions and movement . The cursor appears as a hand that changes depending on what the player is hovering the cursor over . For example , to move in a direction , the cursor changes to point in the intended direction . If players can view an item in greater detail , the cursor changes to a hand holding a magnifying glass . By clicking and dragging the cursor , the player performs actions such as pushing , pulling , and tapping items . 
 Revelation features several gameplay enhancements that aid puzzle solving and plot progression . Early in the game , players receive a camera , which can be used to take screenshots or pictures of clues . Players can use an on @-@ screen journal to jot down notes instead of having to write down clues as with previous Myst games . Much of the game 's story is revealed via flashbacks triggered by an amulet that has the power to relay memories attached to objects . Zip mode , the amulet , the camera , and the journal are available via a menu on the bottom of the game screen . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Atrus calls the Stranger to his home in Tomahna to request his friend 's assistance . Atrus is the writer of special books , which serve as links to worlds known as Ages . Twenty years earlier , his two sons , Sirrus and Achenar , destroyed his library on Myst and trapped their parents in order to plunder the wealth of Atrus ' Ages . The Stranger 's intervention saved Atrus , who had imprisoned his sons via traps intended for thieves . Atrus ' wife Catherine hopes that , after twenty years , they have finally repented for their crimes . Atrus is not as sure his sons have reformed , and so wishes the Stranger to act as an impartial judge . After being knocked unconscious by an explosion , the Stranger realizes that Yeesha , Atrus ' daughter , has disappeared . 
 The Stranger sets out to find Yeesha , travelling to the prison Ages of Spire and Haven . On Spire , Sirrus has used his scientific knowledge to craft explosives , allowing him to breach the chamber that contained the linking book back to Tomahna , and has escaped ; journeying to Haven reveals that Sirrus has also freed Achenar . The Stranger journeys to the Age of <unk> and encounters Achenar , holding a " Life Stone " ; Achenar tells the Stranger that Sirrus is mad and has captured Yeesha , reveals that he kept a journal from twenty years earlier hidden on the island , and warns the Stranger not to let Atrus come after them . Achenar 's journal reveals that he and Sirrus planned to trap their mother Catherine on Riven and use a " Memory Chamber " , a gigantic flower @-@ like structure used to preserve the memories of the dead , to take control of Atrus ' body and steal his knowledge of the Art of Writing . The Life Stone that Achenar stole is used to power the Memory Chambers , leaving the current one in danger of collapse . Shortly afterwards , the Stranger finds Sirrus in an underwater harvester used for collecting memory globes for storing those memories ; he blows up the harvester and flees to an older Memory Chamber , decrepit and abandoned . After encountering the Stranger there , Sirrus tells the Stranger that Achenar is the guilty one , and asks the Stranger to find Atrus and bring him to <unk> to set things right . 
 Finding that the old Memory Chamber door has been locked by Sirrus with a special color @-@ code combination , the Stranger goes to the active Memory Chamber to seek aid from the <unk> Protectors , who believe that the answers can be found in their " mirror realm " , known simply as Dream . Obtaining a " spirit guide " , the Stranger enters Dream and interacts with their guide , who tells them to interact with the Ancestors , the spirits of all <unk> who have died and had their memories preserved , to bring them into harmony . After bringing the Ancestors into harmony , the Stranger discovers the combination to Sirrus ' color @-@ code lock . Returning to the " waking world " and entering the old Memory Chamber , the Stranger finds Yeesha strapped into a chair , and she begs to be released from it with a silver lever . At that moment , Achenar arrives with a crossbow and the Life Stone , and warns that Sirrus used the Memory Chamber to remove Yeesha 's memories and transfer his own into her body ; Achenar points to an amber lever , which will reverse the mind @-@ transfer . 
 At this point , as in the other games , the ending varies . Delaying too long will result in Yeesha ( who is in fact Sirrus ) taking Achenar 's crossbow and shooting first him , then the Stranger . The silver lever will release Yeesha ( again , possessed by Sirrus ) , who drops a large stone on Achenar and the Stranger , and then shoots the Stranger dead . In the good ending , the Stranger pulls the amber lever , reversing the mind @-@ transfer process . But because of the age of the Memory Chamber , it becomes unstable ; Achenar tells the Stranger to return to Dream and set Yeesha 's memories right , while he uses the Life Stone to stabilize the chamber by inserting it into the chamber 's shrine , poisoning him with its contained toxic spores . In Dream , the Stranger finds a monstrous creature , representing Sirrus ' Dream @-@ form , anchored to Yeesha 's essence and preventing her from returning to her body ; with no spirit guide , Sirrus is forced to cling to Yeesha to avoid being lost forever . He maintains his anchors by jumbling up Yeesha 's memories . The Stranger restores Yeesha 's memories and frees her from Sirrus ' grasp ; Sirrus ' Dream @-@ form is destroyed by the shifting waves of Dream , killing him . The Stranger awakens to find Achenar , fatally poisoned , confirming that the transfer was successful ; he dies shortly afterward . The Stranger then returns to Tomahna to meet with Atrus , who says that Catherine has taken Yeesha to Tay ( the " rebel Age " used to evacuate Catherine 's people in Riven ) , and remarks that while his sons are gone , his daughter is safe . 
 = = Development = = 
 When Mattel Interactive still owned the rights to the Myst series , development of Myst IV was contracted out to <unk> Intertainment , developers of the game Sanitarium ; Dreamforge was hired before Presto Studios to develop Myst III : Exile . Dreamforge 's Myst used real @-@ time graphics , and was two years into development and twenty percent complete when Ubisoft , who had by this point acquired the rights to the series , cancelled the project and decided to restart development from scratch internally . 
 According to Geneviève Lord , Revelation 's producer , concluding the story of the two brothers had originally been intended as the plot for Myst III , but due to a limited amount of time to develop the game , as well as to not interfere with Dreamforge 's Myst game , whose plot details were still forming , the plot was dropped and then redeveloped when Ubisoft began work on Myst IV . Cyan , Myst and Riven 's developer , set down " a certain number of rules " that Ubisoft had to follow , according to Lord , but otherwise the team was free to develop new ideas , keeping in the spirit of Myst lore . 
 Ubisoft 's development of Revelation took over three years and more than eighty employees . Early on , the development team made the decision to use pre @-@ rendered graphics for the game , to match the style of previous Myst games . This proved to be a challenge , as the studio had never developed a pre @-@ rendered game before , and had to hire over fifty new employees who had experience in the field . Full production was started on the game before artistic direction and engine development tools were fully established , and the resulting lack of focus and communication meant that a bad working relationship existed between the game designers , programmers , and modelers for most of the production . 
 As an improvement over the prerendered technology present in Myst , Riven , and Exile , Revelation uses its " <unk> " engine to animate nearly everything in the game . The water animations , for example , are fully rendered for each location . The trees sway in the breeze , and the sky has moving clouds . Wildlife includes creatures that walk through the environment and occasionally interact with the player . The game also features a number of effects applied in real time , such as lens flares , dynamic lighting , and an optional focal blur . In a trend started by the original Myst , the game uses live actors to play the game 's roles in live @-@ action video sequences . There are more than 70 minutes of video , and the game allows players to look around and interact with the video while it is playing . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 Jack Wall composed , conducted , and produced the music for Revelation ; the game was his second game score , following the music for Myst III : Exile . Wall was initially a sound engineer and producer , and stated composing " was kind of like a next step for me , rather than something I decided to do early on " . The success and recognition of Exile 's score landed Wall the job of writing Revelation 's music with a budget of $ 100 @,@ 000 — twice the amount he had worked with for Exile . 
 Wall reused , reorchestrated and expanded themes composed by previous Myst composer Robyn Miller ; for example , Wall reused Atrus ' Theme from Riven and the brothers ' leitmotifs from the original game . Wall credited the Myst universe and story with allowing him to write music " Western ears are somewhat less accustomed to " ; Revelation 's score was inspired by Eastern European music that Wall enjoyed in the 1990s . 
 In addition to Jack Wall 's score , the game features a song by Peter Gabriel entitled " Curtains " , originally a B @-@ side from Gabriel 's single " Don 't Give Up " . Gabriel also performed a voiceover for the game . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Overall , Revelation was received positively by critics ; the game garnered 82 % and 81 % averages on aggregate sites Metacritic and GameRankings , respectively ; the Xbox version of the game received less favorable scores than the PC version . 
 As with previous Myst games , the visuals and interactivity of Revelation were singled out as the strongest features . Reviewers praised the use of subtle animations to bring the scenery to life ; GameSpot 's Greg Kasavin stated that the additions " truly helps make each scene in the game seem like more than just a panoramic picture , and instead it feels like a real place " . Jack Wall 's score and the sound design were consistently praised . The addition of the in @-@ game camera and notes system was also positively received . PC Zone proclaimed that although it would have been easy for the developers to lose heart after the disappointing Uru : Ages Beyond Myst , Ubisoft had instead produced " one of the most polished games " the reviewer , Paul Presley , had ever come across . 
 Certain reviewers criticized aspects of the gameplay that had not been fixed or altered from previous Myst titles . Computer Gaming World , for example , complained about having to hunt for the small hotspots that allowed actions to occur . A reviewer for The Houston Chronicle judged the method of traveling from node to node as tiresome to navigate . Another complaint was that the slow cursor animations made searching for actions occasionally tedious . Many publications noted the rather steep computer requirements ; in addition to requiring a DVD @-@ ROM drive , the game took up more than 7 gigabytes when fully installed . Charles Herold of The New York Times , the only mainstream critic with a negative view of Revelation 's music , dismissed the score as " tediously literal " . 
 Revelation would be the last Myst game that used prerendered graphics or full motion video . Cyan Worlds , the original developer of both Myst and Riven , used real @-@ time rendered graphics for the next installment in the series , Myst V : End of Ages . Myst V was announced as the final game in the series . 
 = Boeing Galleries = 
 Boeing Galleries ( North Boeing Gallery and South Boeing Gallery ) are a pair of outdoor exhibition spaces within Millennium Park in the Loop community area of Chicago in Cook County , Illinois , USA . The spaces are located along the south and north mid @-@ level terraces , above and east of Wrigley Square and the Crown Fountain . In a conference at the Chicago Cultural Center , Boeing President and Chief Executive Officer James Bell to Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley announced Boeing would make a $ 5 million grant to fund both the construction of and an endowment for the space . 
 = = Details = = 
 Lying between Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west , Grant Park has been Chicago 's front yard since the mid 19th century . Its northwest corner , north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute , east of Michigan Avenue , south of Randolph Street , and west of Columbus Drive , had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997 , when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park . Today , Millennium Park trails only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction . 
 The city sought Boeing 's financial support in the form of a $ 6 million donation . The purpose of the eventual $ 5 million donation was to fund a space for use as open @-@ air gallery spaces to accommodate regular exhibitions of both visual arts and sculpture . The exhibitions primarily occur in the spring and summer months . The galleries were commissioned in December 2004 ( after the park 's first summer ) , and they provide necessary formal space for the presentation of public exhibitions of modern and contemporary art . Boeing also previously funded the Family Album photograph exhibition that debuted in Millennium Park during its opening weekend . 
 The galleries were constructed between March and June 2005 . The south gallery is 19 @,@ 200 square feet ( 1 @,@ 780 m2 ) ( 240 by 80 feet ( 73 by 24 m ) ) and the north is 14 @,@ 400 square feet ( 1 @,@ 338 m2 ) ( 180 by 80 feet ( 55 by 24 m ) ) . The galleries are surrounded by sycamore trees , which are very rare in Chicago . There is seating on a series of black granite steps , which match The Crown Fountain , along each gallery 's east side . The South Gallery is connected to the fountain by a precast concrete staircase . The galleries are also paved in granite . The north and south galleries are physically separated by AT & T Plaza , which hosts Cloud Gate ( The Bean ) .

 2005 
 The first exhibition in the renamed Galleries was Revealing Chicago : An Aerial Portrait , which was displayed on the Central Chase Promenade and South Boeing Gallery , appeared from June 10 – October 10 , 2005 . The exhibit featured 100 images from Chicago metropolitan area taken on 50 flights that occurred between March 2003 and August 2004 at various seasons of the year . Photographer , Terry Evans , a Chicagoan , says that although 90 % of the photographs were taken while in a helicopter , her preferred method of travel hot air balloon , but Chicago was usually too windy to shoot by balloon . At the time of the installation of the exhibition , the North Boeing Gallery was not complete so the exhibition partially took place on the Central Chase Promenade . 
 2006 
 The galleries hosted In Search of Paradise : Great Gardens of the World from May 12 – October 22 , 2006 . The opening was delayed a week . This exhibition was developed by the Chicago Botanic Garden and included 65 <unk> of gardens from 21 countries including Lurie Garden . All of the photographs were less than five years old . The exhibition was curated by Penelope Hobhouse and presented by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs , Millennium Park with support from The Boeing Company and the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation . The photographs were formatted at 4 by 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 by 1 @.@ 8 m ) . The production schedule for the <unk> formatted photography used was longer than expected , which led to the week @-@ long delay in opening the exhibition . The exhibition was a thematic reference to the Chicago motto , " Urbs in Horto " , which means city in a garden , and was a modern adaptation of a 2003 exhibition at the Chicago Botanic Garden . The exhibit provided viewers with an appreciation for the landscape design , aesthetics and the horticulture of gardens . 
 2007 – 2008 
 The gallery hosted Mark di Suvero , whose large @-@ scale abstract expressionism sculptures were on display from April 17 , 2007 – October 12 , 2008 . The original duration of the exhibition was supposed to only be until April 1 , 2008 , but the exhibit was extended through the summer and fall of 2008 . It is presented by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs , Millennium Park , in cooperation with Millennium Park , Inc . , and is sponsored by The Boeing Company with support from the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation . 
 The exhibit included five pieces in total : two pieces in the North Boeing Gallery and three in the South Boeing Gallery . It was originally scheduled to include only four works . Orion , which was the largest of these , is a bright orange sculpture that measures 53 feet ( 16 @.@ 2 m ) tall and 12 short tons ( 10 @.@ 9 t ; 10 @.@ 7 long tons ) . It has been installed on the North Boeing Gallery . The exhibit featured an interactive piece , Shang , which visitors were invited to climb on in the South Gallery . Shang was 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) tall and had a suspended steel beam that acted as a swing . 
 Chicago Tribune art critic Alan G. Artner felt that the installation was a bit cramped in the Boeing Galleries . He explained that this was why di Suvero was limited to his midsize pieces and felt the Chase Promenade might have served as a better forum and left the artist unfettered to choose from a wider range of pieces . He also wondered why a city that abounds in public sculpture has not ventured to acquire any of his work . 
 2009 – 2010 
 The di Suvero exhibit was removed at the end of October 2008 . In March 2009 , the park announced its plans to install four large @-@ scale contemporary outdoor works by Chinese sculptors in Boeing Galleries from April 9 – October 2010 . The exhibition , entitled " A Conversation With Chicago : Contemporary Sculpture From China " , complements the " The Big World : Recent Art From China " exhibition hosted at the Chicago Cultural Center beginning April 25 , 2009 but was conceived independently and is a distinct body of work . Chen Wenling 's " Valiant Struggle No. 11 , " symbolizes Chinese society . The open @-@ work sculpture " Windy City Dinosaur , " created by Sui <unk> stamped with the phrase " Made in China " is a critique on the cheap mass @-@ produced goods that are building the Chinese export economy . " <unk> Pump , " is a caricature of the oil rigs by Shen <unk> that will have limited Thursday active display times from June 11 through Aug. 27 . Zhan Wang 's " Jia Shan Shi No. 46 " is considered the most abstract and depicts the scholar 's rock in stainless steel . 
 2011 – 2012 
 On February 1 , 2011 , the city announced that the April 6 , 2011 – October 2012 Millennium Park Boeing Galleries , Large @-@ Scale Sculptures Exhibition would feature the work of Mexican sculptor Yvonne Domenge under the exhibition title " Interconnected : The Sculptures of Yvonne Domenge " . In addition to several traditional park sponsors , the exhibit is sponsored by the National Council for Culture and Arts , Richard H. Driehaus Foundation , the National Museum of Mexican Art , and the Consulate General of Mexico . This marks the first installation by a female or Latina artist at the Boeing Galleries . It is regarded as Chicago 's last event of the " Mexico 2010 " city @-@ wide yearlong 70 @-@ event celebration of the bicentennial of Mexico 's independence and the centennial of its Revolution . These are the first sculptures by a Latina artist displayed anywhere in Millennium Park . The exhibition was three years in the making and preliminary sketches were on display at the Chicago Cultural Center in the fall of 2010 . Also , prior to installation the sculptures ' maquettes were displayed at the Chicago Cultural Center as a preview of the exhibit . 
 The city describes Domenge 's sculptures as unifying perceived opposites and harmonizing apparent dissonances by geometrically referencing the natural world . The four piece installation includes a 16 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) tall red @-@ painted bronze sculpture , Tree of Life on the North Boeing Gallery , which stands as the tallest of work in the exhibit with its 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) wide and 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) tall pair of companion seeds . The tree and seed 's represent life in it full form and its new emergence . They are said to represent the " Circle of life " . The South Boeing Gallery hosts three steel spheres : <unk> Ribbon , a 13 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) tall yellow sculpture ; Wind Waves , a white sculpture measuring approximately 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) high and Coral , in blue , approximately 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) high . Domenge ’ s spheres defy gravity and space , conveying a rhythmic beauty and a sense of a larger universal order . The Boeing installation 's spheres are said to express a type of beauty that pays respect to a larger universal order with reference to biological examples . The installation on the Boeing Galleries places the works above and to the east of Wrigley Square ( North Gallery ) and Crown Fountain ( South Gallery ) . Domenge stated that she attempts to express the beauty of natures geometric order that it expresses in the molecular structures of flowers and plants . She feels that the spheres on exhibit in the South gallery depict the geometric perfection of the cosmos and that the celebrate this in a " festival of color and form " . In keeping with her belief in the harmony of nature and out of respect for the park , she presented an installation that required no welding or screws . 
 2013 
 In 2013 , the Boeing Galleries hosted ceramic sculpture by Jun Kaneko . The " Legends , Myths and Truths : Jun Kaneko " exhibit ran from April 12 - November 3 , 2013 . The exhibition included both old and new works by Kaneko . The old subject matter was work on <unk> and the new work focused on <unk> .

On June 18th , 2014 , four new large head sculpture pieces were added to Millennium Park in celebration of its 10th anniversary . Standing at 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 10 m ) tall , three of the works ( Laura , Paula , and Inez ) were located in the South Boeing Galleries . Each work depicts a female subject on the brink of maturation . They came from Barcelona . The fourth and tallest work at 39 feet ( 11 @.@ 89 m ) , originally titled Looking Into My Dreams and by the time of its Chicago arrival titled Looking Into My Dreams , Awilda or Awilda for short , was placed on Michigan Avenue facing Madison Avenue . It had been created in 2012 for an installation in Rio de Janeiro 's Guanabara Bay and arrived in 15 pieces that were bolted together . Awilda is made of resin , while the others are made of cast iron . Jaume Plensa , creator of the adjacent Crown Fountain sculptures , named the four sculptures " 1004 Portraits " because the sculptures added four new faces to the previous 1000 LED faces projected on the Crown Fountain . The works are on loan from Plensa and will be on display until December 2015 . 
 He wanted the statues to have a dreamlike quality ; as a result all the faces have closed eyes and are in a dreamlike position . Plensa wanted everyone who viewed the sculptures to dream with him and the sculptures .

 = Confessions on a Dance Floor = 
 Confessions on a Dance Floor is the tenth studio album by American singer @-@ songwriter Madonna . It was released on November 11 , 2005 by Warner Bros. Records . A complete departure from her previous studio album American Life ( 2003 ) , the album includes influences of 1970s and 1980s disco , as well as modern @-@ day club music . Initially , she began working with Mirwais Ahmadzaï for the album , but later felt that their collaboration was not going in the direction she desired . Madonna took her collaboration with Stuart Price who was overviewing her documentary I 'm Going to Tell You a Secret . The album was mainly recorded at Price 's home @-@ studio where Madonna spent most of her time during the recordings . 
 Musically , the album is structured like a DJ 's set . The songs are sequenced and blended together so that they are played continuously without any gaps . The title arrived from the fact that the album track listing consists of light @-@ hearted and happy songs in the beginning , and progresses to much darker melodies and lyrics describing personal feelings and commitments . Songs on the album use samples and references of music by other dance @-@ oriented artists like ABBA , Donna Summer , Pet Shop Boys , Bee Gees and Depeche Mode , as well as Madonna 's earlier work in the 1980s . 
 Madonna promoted the album through several live performances and a promotional tour . She embarked on the Confessions Tour in 2006 , which became the highest grossing tour ever for a female artist at that time . Four singles were released from the album . " Hung Up " , the lead single , topped the charts in a total of 41 countries . According to Billboard , it was the most successful dance song of the decade . It was followed by " Sorry " which became Madonna 's twelfth number @-@ one single in the United Kingdom . " Get Together " and " Jump " were released as the third and fourth singles respectively , both becoming top @-@ ten hits in several countries . 
 Most critics lauded the album calling it a return to form for Madonna , ranking it alongside her best albums . Madonna was honored with a Grammy Award for Best Electronic / Dance Album in 2007 , as well as International Female Solo Artist at the 2006 BRIT Awards . Commercially , the album peaked at number one in 40 countries , earning a place in the 2007 Guinness Book of World Records for topping the record charts in the most countries . It has sold an estimated 12 million copies worldwide . Retrospectively , Confessions on a Dance Floor was ranked third on " The 99 Greatest Dance Albums of All Time " by Vice magazine . 
 = = Development = = 
 Confessions on a Dance Floor merged elements from 1970s disco , 1980s electropop and modern day club music . Madonna decided to incorporate elements of disco in her songs , while trying not to remake her music from past , instead choosing to pay tribute towards artists like Bee Gees and Giorgio Moroder . The songs reflected Madonna 's thoughts on love , fame and religion , hence the title Confessions on a Dance Floor . It was the complete opposite direction from her previous studio effort American Life ( 2003 ) . The songs on that album were a form of diatribe directed at the American society . However , Madonna decided to take a different direction with this album . Regarding the development , Madonna commented : 
 " When I wrote American Life , I was very agitated by what was going on in the world around me , [ ... ] I was angry . I had a lot to get off my chest . I made a lot of political statements . But now , I feel that I just want to have fun ; I want to dance ; I want to feel buoyant . And I want to give other people the same feeling . There 's a lot of madness in the world around us , and I want people to be happy . " 
 She started to work with Mirwais Ahmadzaï with whom she had previously developed her eighth album Music ( 2000 ) . However , that collaboration did not suit Madonna 's musical direction . According to Madonna , " [ Producer ] Mirwais is also very political , seriously cerebral and intellectual . All we did was sit around , talking politics all the time . So , that couldn 't help but find its way into the music . I think there 's an angry aspect to the music that directly reflects my feelings at the time . " Hence after recording tracks with Mirwais , Madonna decided to stop the project and start fresh . It was then that she turned to Stuart Price who had served as musical director on her two previous concert tours and co @-@ wrote one song on American Life . 
 In 2004 , after the release of American Life , Madonna began working on two different musicals : one tentatively called Hello Suckers and another one with Luc Besson , who previously directed the music video for her single " Love Profusion " . , which would portray her as a woman on her deathbed looking back on her life . Madonna collaborated with Patrick Leonard , Ahmadzaï and Price to write new songs , the latter being assigned to pen disco songs sounding like " ABBA on drugs " . However , Madonna found herself dissatisfied with the script written by Besson and scrapped it . Hence Madonna and Price decided to use the compositions for the album instead . According to Madonna , it was easy for her to shift from her previous album 's sentiments , since she included those political views in her documentary I 'm Going to Tell You a Secret . She elaborated : 
 I was running back and forth , literally , from the editing room with [ the documentary 's director ] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart , who was also mixing the music in the film . We were together , non @-@ stop , all of us . Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours . There are a lot of serious aspects to the movie . I needed a release . When I would go to Stuart 's , and we 'd go up to his loft , it was like , ' Honey , I want to dance . ' I wanted to be happy , silly and buoyant . I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record . So , yes , the new album was a reaction to all the other stuff I was doing , which was very serious in nature . I hope that doesn 't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record , because it 's not . I want people to smile when they hear this record . I wanted it to put a smile on my face , too . 
 = = Recording = = 
 The first three songs that were written for the album were " Hung Up " , " Sorry " and " Future Lovers " In an interview with Billboard , Madonna commented that the recording process was a give @-@ and @-@ take situation . According to her , Price used to stay up all night working on the songs . This was helped by the fact that he is a DJ and is used to staying awake all night . This gave Madonna the chance to work on other aspects of the compositions . She noted the fact that she and Price had opposite characteristics , which helped in their collaboration . The songs were mainly recorded at Price 's home . Madonna said : 
 We did a lot of recording at his house . I 'd come by in the morning and Stuart would answer the door in his stocking feet – as he 'd been up all night . I 'd bring him a cup of coffee and say , ' Stuart , your house is a mess , there 's no food in the cupboard . ' Then I 'd call someone from my house to bring food over for him . And then we 'd work all day . We 're very much the odd couple . 
 She further elaborated that their camaraderie was also due to the fact that they had toured together for Madonna 's Re @-@ Invention World Tour . Hence Madonna reflected that her relationship with Price was more of a brother @-@ sister kind than the formal collaborations she was accustomed to during the recording process . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Confessions on a Dance Floor is a full @-@ on dance , electronic and disco record , which is structured like a nightly set composed by a DJ . The music starts out light and happy , and as it progresses , it becomes intense , with the lyrics dealing more about personal feelings , hence " Confessions " . According to Madonna , " [ t ] his is the direction of my record . That 's what we intended , to make a record that you can play at a party or in your car , where you don 't have to skip past a ballad . It 's nonstop . " Madonna used samples and references of music by other disco artists . In the album 's first song , " Hung Up " , she sampled ABBA 's 1979 hit " Gimme ! Gimme ! Gimme ! ( A Man After Midnight ) " , for which she wrote a personal letter to songwriters Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus , who gave Madonna permission to use the track . References of other disco @-@ influenced acts , including Pet Shop Boys , Depeche Mode , and Daft Punk , were also used on the album , as were the disco hits of Parisian DJ Cerrone . The album has a song called " Forbidden Love " , which is different from the same titled song from Madonna 's sixth studio album Bedtime Stories . Regarding sampling herself and her own song names , Madonna commented : 
 " I did all of that on purpose , [ ... ] I mean , if I 'm going to plagiarize somebody , it might as well be me , right ? I feel like I 've earned the right to rip myself off . ' Talent borrows , genius steals , ' [ ... ] " Let 's see how many other clichés I can throw in there . That 's exactly it . I was only hinting early on , but then I tell it like it is . It 's like , now that I have your attention , I have a few things to tell you . " 
 A pulsating rhythm is present in the song " Isaac " , which is regarded as the only song close to a ballad on the album . However , the song was criticised heavily by a group of Israeli rabbis who commented that Madonna was committing a blasphemy with their religion . They said that the song was about sixteenth century Kabbalah scholar Yitzhak Luria . In reality , the song was named after the featured vocalist Yitzhak Sinwani , who sang portions of the Yemenite Hebrew poem Im Nin <unk> in the track . Initially Madonna toyed with the idea of calling the song as " Fear of Flying " since the idea behind the composition was to let go . However , at the end she decided to just call it " Isaac " after the English version of Sinwani 's name . Regarding the song 's development and the condemnation of the Rabbis , Madonna said : 
 " You do appreciate the absurdity of a group of rabbis in Israel claiming that I 'm being blasphemous about someone when they haven 't heard the record , right ? And then , everyone in the media runs with it as if it 's the truth . And that 's a little weird . But what 's even weirder is that the song is not about Isaac <unk> [ sic ] , as the rabbis claim . It 's named after Yitzhak Sinwani , who 's singing in Yemenite on the track . I couldn 't think of a title for the song . So I called it " Isaac " [ the English translation of " Yitzhak " ] . It 's interesting how their minds work , those naughty rabbis . [ ... ] He 's saying , " If all of the doors of all of the generous peoples ' homes are closed to you , the gates of heaven will always be open . " The words are about 1 @,@ 000 years old . [ ... ] [ Yitzhak ] is an old friend of mine . He 's never made a record . He comes from generations of beautiful singers . Stuart and I asked him to come into the studio one day . We said , " We 're just going to record you . We don 't know what we 're going to do with it . " He 's flawless . One take , no bad notes . He doesn 't even need a microphone . We took one of the songs he did and I said to Stuart , " Let 's sample these bits . We 'll create a chorus and then I 'll write lyrics around it . " That 's how we constructed it . " 
 The lyrics of the songs on the album incorporate bits of Madonna 's musical history and are written in the form of confessions . " Hung Up " contains lyrics from Madonna 's 1989 duet with Prince called " Love Song " , from the Like a Prayer album . " How High " refers to two songs from Madonna 's eighth studio album Music , namely " Nobody 's Perfect " and " I Deserve It " . The lyrics of " Push " thank the person who challenged her to expand her limits and also incorporate elements of The Police 's song " Every Breath You Take " . Other tracks like " Sorry " include the title word in ten different languages . " I Love New York " depicts Madonna praising the city that made her the person she is . Elsewhere , Madonna sings about success and fame ( " Let It Will Be " ) and the crossroads of past , present and future ( " Like It or Not " ) .

" while rappers De La Soul made a guest appearance . Madonna then appeared on the stage and started performing the song while interchanging places with the hologram figures of the band . She was later joined by her own group of dancers and the performance was finished on the main stage rather than the virtual screen . Another performance of " Hung Up " came on April 30 , 2006 during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio , California .

 " Hung Up " was released as the album 's lead single on October 17 , 2005 . The song received critical appreciation amongst reviewers , who suggested that the track would restore the singer 's popularity , which had diminished following the release of her 2003 album American Life . Critics claimed that it was her best dance track to date and have compared it to other Madonna tracks in the same genre . They also complimented the effective synchronization of the ABBA sample with Madonna 's song . " Hung Up " became a worldwide commercial success , peaking atop the charts of 41 countries and earning a place in the Guinness Book of World Records along with the album . In the United States it became her 36th top ten hit , tying her with Elvis Presley . The corresponding music video was a tribute to John Travolta , his movies and dancing in general . Directed by Johan Renck , the video featured Madonna dancing in a ballet studio in a pink leotard , which she left to go to a gaming parlour to dance with her backup dancers . It also featured the physical discipline parkour . 
 " Sorry " was released as the second single from the album on February 28 , 2006 . The song received positive reviews from contemporary critics who declared the track as the strongest song on Confessions on a Dance Floor . It achieved commercial success , topping the singles charts in Italy , Spain , Romania and the United Kingdom , where it became Madonna 's 12th number one single . Elsewhere , the song was a top ten hit in more than a dozen countries around the world . However , in the United States , the song was less commercially successful due to underplay on radio , but managed to reach the top of Billboard 's dance charts . 
 " Get Together " was released as the third single from the album by Warner Bros. Records on June 6 , 2006 . The decision was spurred by the fact that " Get Together " was the third most downloaded song from the album . It was also released to coincide with the start of Madonna 's Confessions Tour . Critics complimented Madonna 's ability to turn cliché comments into pop slogans with the song . The song became a success on the United States dance charts , but failed to enter the Hot 100 . It reached the top ten in countries such as Australia , Canada , United Kingdom and Italy , and peaked at number one in Spain . " Jump " was released as fourth and the final single from the album on October 31 , 2006 . Critics complimented the song and its empowerment theme . The song peaked inside the top ten of the charts in some European countries , while reaching the peak position in Italy and Hungary . In the United States , " Jump " charted in several Billboard dance charts but failed to chart on the Hot 100 .

 Confessions on a Dance Floor received generally positive reviews from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 80 , based on 28 reviews . Keith Caulfield from Billboard commented that Confessions is a " welcome return to form for the Queen of Pop . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic commented that Confessions is the first album where Madonna sounds like a veteran musician since she created the record for " the dance clubs or , in other words , Madonna 's core audience . " Alan Braidwood from the BBC commented that " [ t ] his is the most commercial album Madonna has made in 15 years and it 's magic . " David Browne from Entertainment Weekly noted that for " all its pretenses of being giddy and spontaneous , though , Confessions is rarely either . " 
 Alexis Petridis from The Guardian said that the album " may be a return to core values , but there 's still a bravery about Confessions on a Dancefloor . It revels in the delights of wilfully plastic dance pop in an era when lesser dance @-@ pop artists – from Rachel Stevens to Price 's protege Juliet – are having a desperately thin time of it . " Peter Robinson from Observer Music Monthly declared that the album ranks alongside Madonna 's other albums like True Blue ( 1986 ) and Like a Prayer ( 1989 ) . He credited producer Stuart Price for the album , noting that " Confessions clearly wouldn 't exist without Madonna , but it 's Price who steals the show . " Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork Media noted that with the album " Madonna again reinvents herself , and it appears she 's nearly lapped herself . " According to Deusner , the music also makes her appear young . However he felt that the first half of the album till " I Love New York " was strong , while the second half " loses its delicate balance between pop frivolity and spiritual gravity . " 
 Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine stated that the album is " Madonna 's most purely beat @-@ driven album since her self @-@ titled 1983 debut " and " easily her finest effort since Ray of Light . " Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times called the album " exuberant . " Christian John Wikane from PopMatters commented that the album " proved that Madonna , approaching 50 years @-@ old , is a vital force in the ever @-@ expansive landscape of popular music . " Joan Morgan from The Village Voice noted that " [ w ] ith Confessions on a Dance Floor , Madonna at long last finds her musical footing . Easily dance record of the year , Confessions is an almost seamless tribute to the strobe @-@ lit sensuality of the ' 80s New York club scene that gave Madge her roots , which she explores with compelling aplomb . " Josh Tyrangiel from Time magazine commented that " In dance music , words exist to be repeated , twisted , obscured and resurrected . How they sound in the moment is far more important than what they mean , and Madonna knows that better than anyone . Confessions on a Dance Floor is 56 minutes of energetic moments . It will leave you feeling silly for all the right reasons . " 
 Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was impressed with the album and said that " Madonna , with the help of Price , [ ... ] has succeeded at creating a dance @-@ pop odyssey with an emotional , if not necessarily narrative , arc — and one big continuously @-@ mixed fuck @-@ you to the art @-@ dismantling iPod Shuffle in the process . " He compared the album to Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue 's studio album Light Years ( 2000 ) , saying " Comparisons to Light Years , Kylie Minogue 's own <unk> comeback album from 2000 , are inevitable " . Alan Light from Rolling Stone declared that the album illustrated that " Madonna has never lost her faith in the power of the beat . " However , he opined that " Confessions on a Dance Floor won 't stand the test of time like her glorious early club hits , but it proves its point . Like Rakim back in the day , Madonna can still move the crowd . "

 " The Simpsons Guy " is the first episode of the thirteenth season of the animated television series Family Guy , and the 232nd overall episode . " The Simpsons Guy " is a 45 @-@ minute @-@ long crossover with The Simpsons , and was written by Patrick Meighan and directed by Peter Shin . It originally aired in the United States on September 28 , 2014 on Fox , where both The Simpsons and Family Guy have aired since their respective debuts . 
 In the episode , the Griffins stay with the Simpsons after the former family 's car is stolen just outside Springfield . After the Griffins get their car back , Peter is taken to court as a representative of the Pawtucket Patriot brewery , his employer , when it is discovered that its ale is an unauthorized copy of Duff Beer . 
 The idea for a crossover episode was suggested by Family Guy executive producer and former Simpsons writer Richard Appel , and the episode was announced by Fox in July 2013 . Five of the six main members of the voice cast of The Simpsons — the exception being Harry Shearer — voiced their characters in the episode . " The Simpsons Guy " was met with a mixed reception by critics , who had differing opinions on how well the two shows combined . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Peter creates a controversial comic panel for the Quahog newspaper called " For Pete 's Sake , " which angers local women for its sexist humor . Peter drives the Griffin family out of Quahog to escape the townspeople 's ire . When they stop at a gas station , their car is stolen , leaving them stranded outside Springfield . At the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart , Homer Simpson introduces himself to the Griffins and takes them to the Springfield Police Department , where they are turned away by Chief Wiggum . 
 The Simpson family puts up the Griffin family in their home until things improve . Bart shows Stewie his slingshot , and teaches him how to skateboard , and Bart and Stewie become good friends . When Bart is bullied by Nelson Muntz , Stewie , who is worried about Bart , takes revenge by kidnapping and torturing Nelson . Meanwhile , Lisa tries to find a talent possessed by Meg . When she finds that Meg is a natural at the saxophone , she downplays the talent out of jealousy . Chris and Brian take the Simpsons ' dog , Santa 's Little Helper , for a walk . Brian tries to teach Santa 's Little Helper independence , but the latter runs off when freed . Marge notices Santa 's Little Helper is missing , and Chris and Brian fake his presence until he eventually returns . Homer and Peter try different plans to find Peter 's car , each one backfiring , until they discover it in the possession of Hans Moleman when he accidentally runs Peter over .

 The idea of a crossover with The Simpsons was first suggested while the thirteenth season of Family Guy was being planned out . Executive producer Richard Appel received Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane 's approval and input after brainstorming ideas . Appel then asked for permission from Simpsons executive producers Matt Groening , James L. Brooks and Al Jean to use their characters . This was approved ; Appel was previously a writer @-@ producer on The Simpsons for four seasons , and retained his former colleagues ' trust . Dan Castellaneta , Julie Kavner , Nancy Cartwright , Yeardley Smith and Hank Azaria guest star as their Simpsons characters , but Harry Shearer , the final main cast member of The Simpsons , was unavailable . Asked how he felt about the crossover , Shearer replied , " Matter and anti @-@ matter . " 
 Family Guy writers pitched several storylines for the crossover , including one in which the Griffins stay with Lenny and Carl and never meet the Simpsons , and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of Ralph Wiggum 's imagination . When the final script was read to the show 's staff , Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode . MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long . Supervising director Peter Shin , a former layout artist on The Simpsons , spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield — changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright — and animating the eight @-@ minute fight between Peter and Homer . Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode , but stated that " by season 43 of The Simpsons and season 27 of Family Guy , someone who 's looking at a blank board is going to say , ' Well , the Griffins went to Springfield ... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog ? ' And more heads will explode at Fox . "

 The episode was first announced by Fox in July 2013 to premiere in the fall of 2014 . In May 2014 , the network presented two clips from the episode at their annual upfront presentation . In an interview with Entertainment Weekly about the episode , MacFarlane stated that the key to a good crossover episode is " really about the character interaction . People want to see Peter interact with Homer . They want to see Bart interact with Stewie . In a way , the story in a crossover episode , while it has to be there , is never quite as important as how the characters interact with each other . " The Simpsons creator Groening added , " In this case , it 's two really vivid shows and seeing what they can do together . You want to see them having a good time and you want to see Peter and Homer duke it out " . 
 " The Simpsons Guy " includes cameo appearances by Roger of American Dad ! , Bob Belcher of Bob 's Burgers and Fred Flintstone of The Flintstones . The episode also pokes fun at the different characters ' skin colors ; upon entering Springfield , Peter warns the family not to drink the water because all the citizens appear to have hepatitis , while Homer refers to the Griffin family as " our albino visitors . " The Springfield Gorge scene in Homer and Peter 's fight sequence is a reference to the finale of the season two episode " Bart the Daredevil " in which Homer inadvertently ends up jumping the Gorge on Bart 's skateboard .

 The episode was watched by 8 @.@ 45 million people .

" Clown in the Dumps " , the earlier premiere of the twenty @-@ sixth season of The Simpsons was watched by 8 @.@ 53 million . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 " The Simpsons Guy " received mixed reviews . Writing in USA Today , Mike Foss gave the episode a positive review , but criticized how the episode was written by Family Guy staff and thus lacked elements of The Simpsons ' humor . Jason Hughes of TheWrap was also generally in praise of the episode , but felt that certain scenes — including both Peter and Homer 's fight and an erotic car wash sequence — were " squeamish " and out of place for The Simpsons . He however acknowledged that Bart 's disgust at Stewie 's behavior was " a good statement " of the difference between the two shows . Positive reviews of the crossover also came from IGN , the International Business Times , the Standard @-@ Examiner , and TVLine . 
 Other critics responded negatively . Scott Meslow , of The Week , pointed out his disappointment that the episode parodied a scene in " Bart the Daredevil " , as that episode dealt with Homer and Bart 's relationship , " The Simpsons Guy " used it as a joke in a violent sequence . Todd VanDerWerff wrote on VOX that while he expected the episode to be mediocre , it actually ended up a " blight on humanity itself " . He listed nine reasons for this statement , including his dissatisfaction with the car wash and fight scenes , and the use of sexist jokes which had lost their shock value . After the episode aired in the United Kingdom in July 2015 , Ellen E. Jones , of The Independent , criticized the episode 's rape jokes and violence , and theorized that with the poor box @-@ office performance of his latest film Ted 2 , audiences were growing tired of MacFarlane 's humor . Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph , however , wrote that Family Guy 's usual objectionable content was restrained in the episode , as if it had been " infected " by recent seasons of The Simpsons . 
 The A.V. Club named the episode among the " The worst TV of 2014 " under " Worst crossover " , writing that " for no real reason , Homer and Peter find themselves in an interminable ' sexy car wash ' montage , <unk> and squirting each other in tied @-@ off tees and denim cutoffs . Family Guy prides itself on cutaway gags , but the car @-@ wash scene ... is its most successful look @-@ away gag " . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 " The Simpsons Guy " attracted controversy before it had aired . Tim Winter , the President of the Parents Television Council , a socially conservative media monitoring organization and longtime critic of Family Guy , wrote to Matt Groening , Seth MacFarlane and Fox about a joke seen in the trailer for the episode . In it , after Bart 's prank call to Moe asking for a man with an innuendo name , Stewie makes his own call and tells Moe that his sister is being raped . Winter felt that jokes about rape make it " less outrageous in real life " , and that people who watch The Simpsons but not Family Guy would be unfamiliar with the latter show 's brand of humor . A Fox spokeswoman declined to comment on the joke , while MacFarlane , interviewed by Entertainment Weekly , said that although he would be attacked for stating it as such , the joke was " pretty funny ... in context " . A spokeswoman from the Rape , Abuse & Incest National Network said " I think the show is making it clear that rape is not funny by how they are positioning the joke . " 
 The Parents Television Council declared the episode worst show of the week , saying that it was significantly distasteful to involve The Simpsons because although that series is rated PG , Family Guy aims " to reach the most extreme and outlandish conclusion of any joke , no matter how harsh the punchline may be . For subjecting viewers to jokes about rape , cartoon nudity , and disturbing acts of violence , Fox 's Family Guy will remain the Worst TV Show of the Week " . 
 = Hurricane Eugene ( 1987 ) = 
 Hurricane Eugene was the only tropical cyclone to make landfall in Mexico during the 1987 Pacific hurricane season . The eighth tropical cyclone , fifth named storm , and first hurricane of the season , Eugene developed on July 22 from a tropical disturbance centered well offshore of Mexico . Later that day , the system intensified into a tropical storm while moving northwestward . Eugene reached hurricane status on July 24 ; it briefly peaked as a Category 2 hurricane two days later . Hurricane Eugene weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane ; subsequently , the hurricane made landfall near Manzanillo . Shortly after landfall , Eugene rapidly weakened inland , and was only a tropical storm when it re @-@ emerged into open water , where it quickly dissipated . Throughout Mexico , the storm produced high winds , especially in the southwestern portion of the country . The hurricane deluged the southwest Mexican coastline , resulting in the highest rainfall totals from a tropical cyclone in five Mexican states . Over 5 @,@ 000 people were left homeless , including 60 in Manzanillo . The cities airport control tower was also damaged , thus requiring closure . Elsewhere , 200 to 300 houses were destroyed in Colima . In all , Eugene injured 18 people and caused three fatalities and $ 142 @.@ 12 million ( 1987 USD ) in damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Eugene originated from a tropical disturbance that formed in the southwest Caribbean Sea on July 18 . Over the next two days , the wave moved across Central America and on July 20 , it was located off the coast of Nicaragua . Over the next few days , the system was steered westward due to easterly flow . By 0000 UTC July 22 , the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center had classified the system as a tropical depression while centered 745 mi ( 1 @,@ 200 km ) south of Manzanillo . Subsequently , the depression slowly began curving to the north @-@ northwest , towards a stationary inverted trough over central Mexico . That day , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Eugene . The storm slowed down on July 24 , and located on the southwest side of an upper @-@ level low , the system turned northwestward . Eugene was upgraded into a hurricane later that day , the first of the season . Further intensification occurred , and Eugene attained its peak intensity of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) the next day . 
 Shortly after its peak , the hurricane began to interact with land . The hurricane weakened to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale later that day . At 1200 UTC on July 25 , Eugene made landfall near Manzanillo with winds of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) , making Hurricane Eugene the only tropical system to move ashore during the season , though one hurricane and one tropical storm came close to land in September and October respectively . Because of the topography of Mexico , the storm weakened rapidly , and Eugene was downgraded to a tropical storm six hours after landfall . After briefly moving inland , Eugene emerged into the southern Gulf of California . However , re @-@ intensification did not occur ; instead , Eugene continued weakening due to its close proximity to land . The weakening system was downgraded to a tropical depression early on July 26 , and Eugene dissipated at 1200 UTC that day . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 When the storm first posed a threat to Mexico on July 24 , several ports such as the port of Zihuatanejo and Manzanillo . In Acapulco , navigation classes were suspended . The Mexican navy was put on alert for a total distance of 945 mi ( 1 @,@ 520 km ) spanning from Acapulco to Guaymas . The Servicio <unk> Nacional issued navigation warnings for three coastal states . Hurricane Eugene caused extremely heavy rains in coastal parts of Mexico . Rainfall peaked at 20 @.@ 68 in ( 525 mm ) in <unk> . The cyclone is responsible for the highest tropical cyclone rainfall in the Mexican states of Aguascalientes , Michoacán , Querétaro , Tlaxcala , and Zacatecas . Waves of 15 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) were also reported . 
 Hurricane Eugene brought widespread flooding , heavy rain , and high winds across Mexico , which leveled homes and palm trees . Numerous poorly built homes lost their roofs , though well @-@ built structures did not sustain any significant damage . In Puerto Vallarta , Hurricane Eugene was responsible for extensive damage to homes and for knocking out power to most of the city , which , along with surrounding areas , was also flooded with 1 @.@ 5 ft ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) of water . In Manzanillo , the storm knocked down trees and beach huts and power was knocked out for most of the city . The Manzanillo Airport was closed for a few days after the airport 's control tower was damaged . A highway from Manzanillo to Colima was closed to thru traffic because of the storm . Throughout the state of Colima , crop damage was severe and 200 @-@ 300 homes were destroyed statewide . Several hundred miles further south , in <unk> and Pueblo <unk> , many homes and public buildings received damage . In Michoacán , the Grande River spilled over its banks , flooding five villages and leaving at least 10 @,@ 000 people without transportation or communication services . Several landslides were reported along a number of main highways , making travel in the area difficult . Overall , crop damage in the state was severe . 
 The hurricane destroyed about 15 sq. mi ( 39 km2 ) of fruit crop . A total of 18 people were injured during the storm . The storm destroyed 3 @,@ 107 acres of mango trees and 5 @,@ 662 acres of bananas were destroyed , with the worst crop damage occurring in Jalisco . Moreover , 540 acres of cocoa , 580 acres of papaya , and at least 382 acres of lemon trees were also destroyed by Eugene . Due to a combination of Eugene and Hurricane Greg , the region registered rainfall amounts for times the average . In addition , three people were killed ; two of the deaths occurred in Michoacán . One man died in Venustiano <unk> when a palm tree was blown over . Another man perished in Manzanillo when he was struck by a fallen palm tree . Over 5 @,@ 000 people were left homeless ( mostly from poor and rural areas ) , including 60 people in Manzanillo . Total crop damage amounted to $ 142 million ( 1987 USD ) ; fruit crop damage alone amounted to more than $ 2 @.@ 6 million ( 1987 USD ) . Damage to eight beach houses totaled to $ 120 @,@ 000 .

 During the aftermath of the storm , the navy , army , and local government devised a cleanup plan . Three hundred government employees ( with guidance of the military ) worked to clear debris . They quickly restored water and power service , and within a few days streets had been cleaned for most of the impacted area . Authorities in Manzanillo asked for medicine , clothing and food from nearby areas while the red cross treated the injured . Many of the displaced were evacuated to government offices . Within a few days after the storm , the ports of Manzanillo , Acapulco , Zihuatanejo and Lazaro Cardenas were reopened . The remnants of the storm later brought rain to the Rockie Mountains and the Southwestern United States . Eugene is one of three known July Pacific hurricane strikes , where hurricane @-@ force winds are estimated over land . The other two hurricanes were Hurricane Calvin in 1993 and a hurricane that struck Baja California Sur in 1954 . 
 = SMS Breslau = 
 SMS Breslau was a Magdeburg @-@ class cruiser of the Imperial German Navy , built in the early 1910s . Following her commissioning , Breslau and the battlecruiser Goeben were assigned to the Mittelmeerdivision ( Mediterranean Division ) in response to the Balkan Wars . After evading British warships in the Mediterranean to reach Constantinople , Breslau and Goeben were transferred to the Ottoman Empire in August 1914 , to entice the Ottomans to join the Central Powers in World War I. The two ships , along with several other Ottoman vessels , raided Russian ports in October 1914 , prompting a Russian declaration of war . The ships were renamed Midilli and Yavûz Sultân Selîm , respectively , and saw extensive service with the Ottoman fleet , primarily in the Black Sea against the Russian Black Sea Fleet . 
 Midilli was active in laying minefields off the Russian coast , bombarding Russian ports and installations and , because of a shortage of Ottoman merchant ships , transporting troops and supplies to the Black Sea ports supplying Ottoman troops fighting in the Caucasus Campaign . She was lightly damaged several times by Russian ships , but the most serious damage was inflicted by a mine in 1915 , which kept her out of service for half of a year . The ship was mined and sunk in January 1918 during the Battle of Imbros , with the loss of the vast majority of her crew . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Breslau was ordered under the contract name " Ersatz Falke " and was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1910 . At her launching ceremony on 16 May 1911 , she was christened by the mayor of Breslau , the ship 's namesake . After her launching , fitting @-@ out work commenced and lasted until mid @-@ 1912 . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 20 August 1912 . 
 The ship was 138 @.@ 7 meters ( 455 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 13 @.@ 5 m ( 44 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 4 m ( 14 ft ) forward . She displaced 4 @,@ 570 t ( 4 @,@ 500 long tons ; 5 @,@ 040 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of AEG @-@ Vulcan steam turbines driving two 3 @.@ 4 @-@ meter ( 11 ft ) propellers . They were designed to give 25 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 19 @,@ 000 kW ) , but reached 33 @,@ 482 shp ( 24 @,@ 968 kW ) in service . These were powered by sixteen coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers , although they were later altered to use fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . These gave the ship a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) . Breslau carried 1 @,@ 200 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 200 long tons ) of coal , and an additional 106 tonnes ( 104 long tons ) of oil that gave her a range of approximately 5 @,@ 820 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 780 km ; 6 @,@ 700 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . Breslau had a crew of 18 officers and 336 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 13 in ) SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , eight were located amidships , four on either side , and two were side by side aft . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees , which allowed them to engage targets out to 12 @,@ 700 m ( 41 @,@ 700 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 800 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . By 1917 , the 10 @.@ 5 cm guns were replaced with eight 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 91 in ) SK L / 45 guns , one fore and aft and three on each broadside . She was also equipped with a pair of 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside . She could also carry 120 mines . The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick amidships . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides , and the deck was covered with up to 60 mm thick armor plate . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Following her commissioning in 1912 , Breslau was attached to the German Mittelmeerdivision ( Mediterranean Division ) along with the battlecruiser Goeben under the command of Admiral Wilhelm Souchon . The German Navy decided it needed a permanent naval presence in the Mediterranean in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars that began in 1912 . Karl Dönitz , the future Grand Admiral during World War II , served aboard Breslau from 1912 to 1916 . At the outbreak of World War I , Breslau and Goeben were to interdict French transports transferring troops from Algeria to France . On 3 August 1914 , Souchon 's two ships were steaming off Algeria ; shortly after 06 : 00 , Breslau bombarded the embarkation port of Bône while Goeben attacked Philippeville . The attacks caused minimal damage , however , and Souchon quickly broke off and returned to Messina to replenish his coal stocks . 
 Although the British were not yet at war with Germany , the two British battlecruisers HMS Indomitable and Indefatigable shadowed the German ships while en route to Messina . After partially replenishing Goeben 's coal on the 5th , Souchon arranged to meet a collier in the Aegean . Goeben and Breslau left port the following morning bound for Constantinople , pursued by the British Mediterranean Fleet . That evening , the 1st Cruiser Squadron , commanded by Rear Admiral Ernest Troubridge , intercepted the Germans ; Breslau briefly exchanged fire with the light cruiser Gloucester before Troubridge broke off the attack , fearing Goeben 's powerful 28 cm ( 11 in ) guns . 
 On 8 August , Goeben and Breslau met the collier off the island of <unk> near Naxos , and two days later they entered the Dardanelles . To circumvent neutrality requirements , Germany transferred the two ships to the Ottoman Navy on 16 August , though the supposed sale was simply a ruse . On 23 September , Souchon accepted an offer to command the Turkish fleet . Breslau was renamed Midilli while Goeben was renamed Yavûz Sultân Selîm ; their German crews remained with the ships and donned Ottoman uniforms and fezzes . The British did not accept the sale of the ships to the Ottoman Empire and stationed a blockading force outside the Dardanelles with orders to attack the ships if they appeared , regardless of the flag they flew . 
 = = = Ottoman service = = = 
 On the evening of 27 October , Midilli and the rest of the Ottoman fleet left the Bosporus and steamed into the Black Sea , ostensibly to conduct maneuvers . Instead , the fleet split into four groups to attack Russian bases on the other side of the Black Sea ; Midilli and another cruiser were tasked with mining the Strait of Kerch and then attacking the port of Novorossisk . Midilli laid sixty mines in the Strait , which later claimed two Russian merchant ships , and then joined the other ship in bombarding Novorossisk . They set the port 's oil tanks on fire , damaged seven merchant ships , and sank Nikolai of 1 @,@ 085 gross register tons ( GRT ) . Although the damage inflicted on the Russians was relatively light , it forced the Russians to declare war on the Ottoman Empire , bringing the country into the war on the side of Germany . 
 In early November 1914 , while Midilli was operating in the eastern Black Sea and covering Ottoman transports , she was detached to shell the Russian port of Poti in retaliation for Russian attacks on Turkish shipping . On 17 November , she sortied with Yavûz Sultân Selîm , under the command of Souchon , in an attempt to intercept the Black Sea Fleet as it returned from bombarding Trebizond . Midilli discovered the Russian ships off Cape Sarych , the southern tip of the Crimea in poor visibility at short range . In the resulting engagement , Souchon ordered Midilli to assume a safer position to Yavûz 's rear , but she was engaged by the pre @-@ dreadnoughts Tri Sviatitelia and Rostislav without effect before Souchon ordered the Turkish ships to disengage shortly afterward . The cruiser spent the rest of the month escorting shipping to Trebizond . On 5 December , she escorted a small raiding party to Akkerman , Bessarabia , that was intended to attack railroad installations . On the return voyage , Midilli bombarded Sevastopol , damaging some minesweepers at anchor . 
 A month later , on 23 December , Midilli sortied to rendezvous with Yavûz Sultân Selîm off Sinope , and in the darkness the following morning she encountered the Russian transport Oleg , which was intended to be sunk as a blockship in Zonguldak . Midilli quickly sank Oleg but was forced to turn away after spotting Rostislav . She then encountered another blockship , Athos , and forced her crew to scuttle the ship . She then briefly engaged Russian destroyers before moving ahead of the Russian fleet to monitor their progress . Ottoman coastal guns forced the remaining blockships to scuttle in deep water . Midilli conducted a series of sorties against the Russians in early 1915 , including an operation in concert with the cruiser Hamidiye in January , during which they inadvertently came into contact with the Black Sea Fleet . Midilli scored a hit on the battleship Evstafi 's main battery turret before the Ottoman ships withdrew . 
 On 3 April , the Ottoman fleet sortied to attack Russian transports off Odessa . Midilli and Yavûz Sultân Selîm provided the covering force for the attack , which failed after the cruiser Mecidiye struck a mine and sank off Odessa . The Russian fleet attempted to intercept the Turkish force , but Midilli and Yavûz Sultân Selîm were able to escape undamaged . The two ships , joined by Hamidiye , conducted a sweep to attack Russian transports on 6 May , but found no targets . Later that month , detachments of naval infantry from Midilli and Yavûz Sultân Selîm were landed to assist in the defense against the Allied landings at Gallipoli . On the night of 10 / 11 June , Midilli encountered the Russian destroyers <unk> and Gnevny off Zonguldak . In a brief firefight , the cruiser crippled Gnevny with a hit in her starboard engine compartment that broke the main steam line to the engines , but was forced to turn away when Gnevny fired five torpedoes at her . Midilli was hit seven times herself with only slight damage and Gnevny was towed back to Sevastopol the following day by <unk> . 
 Midilli struck a mine on 18 July as she sailed from Constantinople to escort a merchant ship through the minefields defending the capital . The explosion under No. 4 boiler room killed eight crewmen and she was flooded with over 600 t ( 590 long tons ) of water . The ship made it to port at İstinye and an inspection revealed that she was not badly damaged . Hampered by a shortage of trained personnel and material , however , the ship 's repairs took quite a long time . The ship did not return to service until February 1916 , and the opportunity was taken to replace two of her 10 @.@ 5 cm guns with 15 cm pieces . On 27 February , she was used to quickly transport 71 officers and men of a machine @-@ gun company and a significant stock of supplies and munitions to Trebizond , which was then under heavy pressure from the Russian army . While en route on the night of the 28th , she encountered the Russian destroyers <unk> and <unk> . Midilli evaded the Russians and reached Trebizond . On 2 March , she attempted to attack a pair of destroyers north of Zonguldak , but she was unable to catch them . The ship then returned to the Bosporus . On 11 March , Midilli made another run , this time carrying 211 soldiers and twelve barrels of fuel and lubricating oil , which were successfully landed on the 13th . She then stopped in Samsun , where she picked up 30 t ( 30 long tons ; 33 short tons ) of flour , one ton of maize , and 30 tons of coal , before returning to the Bosporus . 
 A third supply operation followed on 3 April , when the ship brought 107 men , 5 @,@ 000 rifles , and 794 cases of ammunition to Trebizond . After making the delivery , the ship met the U @-@ boat U @-@ 33 and proceeded to attack Russian forces . Midilli shelled Russian positions at <unk> Bay , where she set the minesweeper <unk> on fire , which was then destroyed by U @-@ 33 's deck gun . Midilli then turned north and sank a Russian sailing vessel off Tuapse before running into the powerful dreadnought battleship Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya . Midilli fled at high speed after being straddled several times , though she was not damaged . In early May , the cruiser laid two minefields , each of 60 mines . The first of these was laid off the Chilia branch of the Danube River and the other off Cape <unk> in the Crimea . On the second trip she bombarded Eupatoria after laying her mines . Midilli transported more troops to Sinope and Samsun on 30 May , returning with grain and tobacco as deck cargo . 
 In July , Midilli and Yavûz Sultân Selîm sortied to support the Ottoman counterattack at Trebizond , which broke the Russian lines and advanced some 20 km ( 12 mi ) . Midilli sank a pair of Russian ships off Sochi on 4 July and destroyed another that had been torpedoed the previous day . She then rejoined Yavûz Sultân Selîm for the return to the Bosporus , during which the two ships evaded strong Russian forces attempting to intercept them . Later that month , on 21 July , Midilli attempted to lay a minefield off Novorossisk , but Russian wireless interception allowed the dreadnought Imperatritsa Mariya and several destroyers to leave port and attempt to cut Midilli off from the Bosporus . The two ships encountered each other at 13 : 05 , and Midilli quickly turned back south . Her stern 15 cm gun kept Russian destroyers at bay , but the ship only slowly drew out of range of Imperatritsa Mariya 's heavy guns . Several near misses rained shell splinters on the deck and wounded several men . Heavy use of smoke screens and a rain squall allowed Midilli to break contact with her Russian pursuers , and she reached the Bosporus early the following morning . By the end of 1916 , a severe coal shortage prevented Midilli and Yavûz Sultân Selîm from conducting offensive operations . 
 In May 1917 , Midilli laid a minefield off the mouth of the Danube ; while there , she destroyed the wireless station on <unk> Island and captured 11 prisoners . The minefield she laid later sank the destroyer Leytenant <unk> on 30 June . While Midilli was at sea , a Russian force raided the Bosporus , including Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya , which had by then been renamed Svobodnaya Rossiya . Upon returning to port , Midilli was spotted by the Russian fleet , which attempted to cut her off from the safety of the Bosporus . Midilli raced toward port , while salvos from Svobodnaya Rossiya fell around her . The destroyer Gnevny closed to attack , but Midilli 's 15 cm guns drove her off . The cruiser managed to reach port without damage ; this was the last engagement of the war between the former German warships and the Russian fleet . On 1 November , Midilli left the Bosporus to conduct a sweep for Russian warships . The Russians observed the departure and attempted to attack the cruiser with Svobodnaya Rossiya and the new battleship Volya , but mutiny aboard Svobodnaya Rossiya prevented the force from intercepting Midilli before she slipped back into port that night .

 On 20 January 1918 , Midilli and Yavûz Sultân Selîm left the Dardanelles under the command of Vice Admiral Hubert von Rebeur @-@ Paschwitz , who had replaced Souchon the previous September . Rebeur @-@ Paschwitz 's intention was to draw Allied naval forces away from Palestine in support of Turkish forces there . Outside the straits , in the course of what became known as the Battle of Imbros , the two Ottoman ships surprised and sank the monitors Raglan and M28 which were at anchor and unsupported by the pre @-@ dreadnoughts that should have been guarding them . Rebeur @-@ Paschwitz then decided to proceed to the port of Mudros ; there the British pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Agamemnon was raising steam to attack the Turkish ships . While en route , Midilli struck a total of five mines and sank ; Yavûz hit three mines as well and was forced to beach to avoid sinking . Three hundred and thirty of Midilli 's crew were killed in her sinking , 162 survivors were rescued by British destroyers . According to Hildebrand , Röhr and Steinmetz , only 133 men were rescued from the ship .

 Typhoon Conson , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Frank , was the first of the record ten typhoons to impact Japan during the 2004 Pacific typhoon season . Developing out of a tropical depression near the northern Philippines in early June , Conson slowly traveled towards the north . Gradually strengthening , the storm reached typhoon status late on June 7 according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and several hours later according to the Japan Meteorological Agency . After turning towards the northeast , the typhoon brushed Taiwan and reached its peak intensity with winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph 10 @-@ minute winds ) on June 9 . After reaching its peak , Conson gradually weakened , passing through Okinawa before being downgraded to a tropical storm the next day . On June 11 , the storm made landfall as a minimal tropical storm in the Kōchi Prefecture just before becoming extratropical . The extratropical remnants continued towards the northeast and were last mentioned on June 14 crossing the international date line . 
 Typhoon Conson brought heavy rains and high winds to the Philippines , Taiwan , Okinawa , and Japan . Flooding in the Philippines killed two people and caused about <unk> million ( US $ 35 @,@ 000 ) in damages . However , some reports state that up to 30 people died in the Philippines . In the Ryukyu Islands , the storm brought heavy rains and high winds to several islands , damaging crops and leaving many without power . As it became extratropical , Conson caused moderate damage in southern Japan , including a few landslides which prompted evacuations . Throughout Japan , losses reached 355 @.@ 7 million yen ( US $ 3 @.@ 8 million ) .

 Early on June 4 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began monitoring an area of low pressure associated with deep convection about 780 km ( 485 mi ) south @-@ southeast of Hong Kong . Later that day , following notable development , they classified the system as Tropical Depression 07W . At the same time , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) also began monitoring the system as a tropical depression . Slowly moving towards the southeast , 07W gradually strengthened , being classified a tropical storm by the JTWC at 1200 UTC the next day . Around the same time , the storm entered the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration 's area of responsibility and was given the local name Frank . Twenty @-@ four hours later , 07W made its closest approach to the Philippines , passing within 295 km ( 185 mi ) of Manila . A few hours later , the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Conson ; a name contributed by Vietnam that is a picturesque place in the country , consisting of a mountain , pine forest , streams , pagodas and many historical monuments . 
 A ridge located over the central Philippines caused Conson to turn towards the north . Continuing to intensify , the JTWC assessed the storm to have reached typhoon status at 1800 UTC on June 7 . The JMA also upgraded the storm to a typhoon about twelve hours later . A 28 km ( 17 mi ) wide eye developed as the cyclone turned towards the northeast . Originally , forecasts showed the typhoon making landfall in southern Taiwan but the turn towards the northeast spared the island from a direct hit . Shortly after being classified as a typhoon by the JMA , the JTWC upgraded Conson to a Category 2 typhoon on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph 1 @-@ minute winds ) . The eye later became slightly disorganized and the cloud tops around the center warmed . However , the storm reorganized the next day and was upgraded to a Category 3 typhoon by the JTWC with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph 1 @-@ minute winds ) . The intensification was the result of the influence of an approaching shortwave trough which enhanced poleward outflow . Around this time , PAGASA issued their final advisory on Typhoon ' Frank ' as it moved out of their area of responsibility . 
 The strengthening was the result of Conson passing over the warm waters of the Kuroshio Current . The forward motion on the typhoon also began to increase as it interacted with a baroclinic zone . Shortly after , the JMA assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph 10 @-@ minute winds ) and a minimum pressure of 960 hPa ( mbar ) . Later that day , the storm passed over Okinawa as it weakened . By June 10 , Conson began to undergo an extratropical transition . Continuing increase in forward speed caused the low to become exposed from shower and thunderstorm activity on the southern edge of the circulation . Around 1200 UTC , the center of circulation became separated from deep convection , leading to the typhoon being downgraded to a tropical storm by both agencies several hours later . Early on June 11 , the JTWC reported that the storm had completed its extratropical transition just south of Japan . However , the JMA kept Conson has a tropical cyclone through its landfall in Kōchi Prefecture as a minimal tropical storm . Shortly after landfall , it was classified as an extratropical cyclone . Continuing towards the northeast , the storm remained weak and was last mentioned as it crossed the international date line on June 14 near the Aleutian Islands . 
 The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10 @-@ minute sustained winds , while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses 1 @-@ minute sustained winds . The conversion factor between the two is <unk> JMA 's peak intensity for Conson was 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) 10 @-@ minute sustained , or 160 km / h ( 105 mph ) 1 @-@ minute sustained . The JTWC 's peak intensity for Conson was 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) 1 @-@ minute sustained , or 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) 10 @-@ minute sustained . The National Meteorological Center of China estimated a peak intensity of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) 10 @-@ minute sustained , or 160 km / h ( 105 mph ) 1 @-@ minute sustained . The Hong Kong Observatory assessed Conson to be slightly weaker than other agencies , with peak winds estimated at 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) 10 @-@ minute sustained , or 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) 1 @-@ minute sustained .

 On June 7 , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration raised Public Storm Signal No. 1 for most of Luzon . As Conson strengthened into a typhoon , northern areas of Luzon were placed under Public Storm Signal No. 3 , resulting in school closures . As the typhoon passed by the Philippines , it dropped heavy rains , peaking at 333 @.@ 8 mm ( 13 @.@ 1 in ) in Iba . The highest 24 ‑ hour rainfall was recorded in Subic Bay at 230 mm ( 9 in ) . Minor flooding and power outages were reported in Manila . These heavy rains led to flooding which reportedly killed 30 people in Luzon . However , the fatalities are uncertain as PAGASA reported that two people were killed by the storm . In all , Conson caused about <unk> million ( <unk> ) in damage .

 High winds and heavy rain warnings were issued for most of Taiwan along with sea warnings . Schools and businesses on Orchid Island were suspended on June 9 and 10 as Typhoon Conson passed by . Some domestic flights were cancelled and rail and ferry services were suspended ahead of the storm . When Conson was first classified , Hong Kong was placed under a standby signal as the storm was located within 800 km ( 500 mi ) of the city Only a few showers were reported in the city due to the storm . Taiwanese officials checked water gates throughout the island on June 8 and found that 68 were missing . Water management officials stated that the missing gates could " ... wreak unnecessary damage ... " . The following day , 42 of the missing gates had been replaced . Fishing boats returned to port for shelter during the storm . An emergency operations center was set up to carry out search and rescue missions during and following the typhoon . Heavy rains from the typhoon peaked at 262 @.@ 5 mm ( 10 @.@ 3 in ) in Yilan County . The storm caused minor damage and one minor injury during as it passed by Taiwan . Although Conson dropped heavy rains across the island , it was not enough to alleviate drought conditions in the southern areas .

 Traveling towards the northeast , Conson headed towards Okinawa where schools were closed and local transportation was disrupted due to the storm . The Japan Meteorological Agency warned residents about the threat of heavy rains and high winds resulting from the storm . A United States naval base located in Okinawa was placed under a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness ( TCCR ) Four as Typhoon Conson was approaching . As the storm neared the islands , the naval base was put under TCCR Three , indicating that winds of 92 km / h ( 57 mph ) were anticipated within 48 hours . Ahead of the storm , upwards of 254 mm ( 10 in ) fell across the islands , which were indirectly related to the storm . In southern Japan , several airlines canceled flights due to poor weather conditions . 
 Heavy rains , peaking at 345 mm ( 13 @.@ 5 in ) on <unk> , triggered flooding and landslides throughout the islands . The highest sustained winds on the islands were also recorded on <unk> at 137 km / h ( 85 mph ) and the highest gust was recorded on Miyako @-@ jima at 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . Despite transitioning into an extratropical cyclone while impacting Japan , Conson brought heavy rains and high winds to Kyūshū . The highest rainfall and gusts were recorded in Tanegashima at 277 @.@ 5 mm ( 10 @.@ 9 in ) and 146 km / h ( 91 mph ) respectively ; the highest sustained wind was recorded in Muroto , Kōchi at 109 km / h ( 68 mph ) . 
 On Ishigaki Island , high winds and heavy rains cut power to many residences and damaged crops . A total of 1 @,@ 960 ha ( 4 @,@ 800 acres ) of agricultural land was damaged by the storm , leaving 31 @.@ 9 million yen ( US $ 346 @,@ 000 ) in losses . Significant agricultural damage was also sustained on Miyako @-@ jima , leaving 76 @.@ 5 million yen ( US $ 805 @,@ 000 ) in losses . Okinawa sustained moderate damage during the passage of Conson , with several homes flooded and large lengths of power lines were lost . At the height of the storm , roughly 3 @,@ 300 residences were without power and 1 @,@ 305 power lines were downed . Additionally , 1 @,@ 685 ha ( 4 @,@ 160 acres ) of agricultural land was damaged , leaving 32 @.@ 3 million yen ( US $ 350 @,@ 000 ) in losses . 
 In Kagoshima Prefecture , Conson damaged 1 @,@ 846 ha ( 4 @,@ 560 acres ) of agricultural land and flooded six homes . Agricultural and property damage in the prefecture amounted to 100 million yen ( US $ 1 million ) and 115 million yen ( US $ 1 @.@ 2 million ) respectively . A large landslide , roughly 30 m ( 98 ft ) wide , in Matsuyama , Ehime prompted the evacuation of 19 homes ; however , no known damage resulted from the incident . Throughout Kōchi Prefecture , several highways were shut down after being damaged by Conson . Over 20 schools were let out early due to the deteriorating conditions . 
 = Telescopium = 
 Telescopium is a minor constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere , one of twelve named in the 18th century by French astronomer Nicolas @-@ Louis de Lacaille and one of several depicting scientific instruments . Its name is a Latinized form of the Greek word for telescope . Telescopium was later much reduced in size by Francis Baily and Benjamin Gould . 
 The brightest star in the constellation is Alpha Telescopii , a blue @-@ white subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 3 @.@ 5 , followed by the orange giant star Zeta Telescopii at magnitude 4 @.@ 1 . Eta and PZ Telescopii are two young star systems with debris disks and brown dwarf companions . Telescopium hosts two unusual stars with very little hydrogen that are likely to be the result of two merged white dwarfs : PV Telescopii , also known as HD <unk> , is a hot blue extreme helium star , while RS Telescopii is an R Coronae Borealis variable . RR Telescopii is a cataclysmic variable that brightened as a nova to magnitude 6 in 1948 . 
 = = History = = 
 Telescopium was introduced in 1751 – 52 by Nicolas @-@ Louis de Lacaille with the French name le Telescope , depicting an aerial telescope , after he had observed and catalogued 10 @,@ 000 southern stars during a two @-@ year stay at the Cape of Good Hope . He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe . All but one honored instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment . Covering 40 degrees of the night sky , the telescope stretched out northwards between Sagittarius and Scorpius . Lacaille had Latinised its name to Telescopium by 1763 . 
 The constellation was known by other names . It was called Tubus <unk> in the eighteenth century , during which time three constellations depicting telescopes were recognised — Tubus Herschelii Major between Gemini and Auriga and Tubus Herschelii Minor between Taurus and Orion , both of which had fallen out of use by the nineteenth century . Johann Bode called it the Astronomische <unk> in his 1805 <unk> and kept its size , but later astronomers Francis Baily and Benjamin Gould subsequently shrank its boundaries . The much @-@ reduced constellation lost several brighter stars to neighbouring constellations : Beta Telescopii became Eta Sagittarii , which it had been before Lacaille placed it in Telescopium , Gamma was placed in Scorpius and renamed G Scorpii by Gould , Theta Telescopii reverted to its old appellation of d Ophiuchi , and Sigma Telescopii was placed in Corona Australis . Initially <unk> , the latter is now known as HR <unk> . The original object Lacaille had named Eta Telescopii — the open cluster Messier 7 — was in what is now Scorpius , and Gould used the Bayer designation for a magnitude 5 star , which he felt warranted a letter . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 A small constellation , Telescopium is bordered by Sagittarius and Corona Australis to the north , Ara to the west , Pavo to the south , and Indus to the east , cornering on Microscopium to the northeast . The three @-@ letter abbreviation for the constellation , as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922 , is ' Tel ' . The official constellation boundaries , as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined by a quadrilateral ( illustrated in infobox ) . In the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 18h <unk> and <unk> <unk> , while the declination coordinates are between − 45 @.@ 09 ° and − 56 @.@ 98 ° . The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 33 ° N.

 Within the constellation 's borders , there are 57 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6 @.@ 5 . With a magnitude of 3 @.@ 5 , Alpha Telescopii is the brightest star in the constellation . It is a blue @-@ white subgiant of spectral type <unk> which lies around 250 light @-@ years away . It is radiating nearly 800 times the Sun 's luminosity , and is estimated to be 5 @.@ 2 ± 0 @.@ 4 times as massive and have 3 @.@ 3 ± 0 @.@ 5 times the Sun 's radius . Close by Alpha Telescopii are the two blue @-@ white stars sharing the designation of Delta Telescopii . Delta ¹ Telescopii is of spectral type <unk> and apparent magnitude 4 @.@ 9 , while Delta ² Telescopii is of spectral type <unk> and magnitude 5 @.@ 1 . They form an optical double , as the stars are estimated to be around 710 and 1190 light @-@ years away respectively . The faint ( magnitude 12 @.@ 23 ) Gliese 754 , a red dwarf of spectral type M4.5V , is one of the nearest 100 stars to Earth at 19 @.@ 3 light @-@ years distant . Its eccentric orbit around the Galaxy indicates that it may have originated in the Milky Way 's thick disk . 
 At least four of the fifteen stars visible to the unaided eye are orange giants of spectral class K. The second brightest star in the constellation — at apparent magnitude 4 @.@ 1 — is Zeta Telescopii , an orange subgiant of spectral type K1III @-@ IV . Around 1 @.@ 53 times as massive as the Sun , it shines with 512 times its luminosity . Located 127 light years away from Earth , it has been described as yellow or reddish in appearance . Epsilon Telescopii is a binary star system : the brighter component , Epsilon Telescopii A , is an orange giant of spectral type K0III with an apparent magnitude of + 4 @.@ 52 , while the 13th magnitude companion , Epsilon Telescopii B , is 21 arcseconds away from the primary , and just visible with a 15 cm aperture telescope on a dark night . The system is 417 light @-@ years away . Iota Telescopii and HD <unk> — magnitude 5 orange giants of spectral types K0III and <unk> respectively — make up the quartet . They are around 370 and 497 light @-@ years away from the Sun respectively . Another ageing star , Kappa Telescopii is a yellow giant with a spectral type <unk> and apparent magnitude of 5 @.@ 18 . Around 1 @.@ 87 billion years old , this star of around 1 @.@ 6 solar masses has swollen to 11 times the Sun 's diameter . It is approximately 293 light @-@ years from Earth , and is another optical double . 
 Xi Telescopii is an irregular variable star that ranges between magnitudes 4 @.@ 89 and 4 @.@ 94 . Located 1079 light @-@ years distant , it is a red giant of spectral type M2III that has a diameter around 5 @.@ 6 times the Sun 's , and a luminosity around 2973 times that of the Sun . Another irregular variable , RX Telescopii is a red supergiant that varies between magnitudes 6 @.@ 45 and 7 @.@ 47 , just visible to the unaided eye under good viewing conditions . BL Telescopii is an Algol @-@ like eclipsing binary system that varies between apparent magnitudes 7 @.@ 09 and 9 @.@ 08 over a period of just over 778 days ( 2 years 48 days ) . The primary is a yellow supergiant that is itself intrinsically variable . Dipping from its baseline magnitude of 9 @.@ 6 to 16 @.@ 5 , RS Telescopii is a rare R Coronae Borealis variable — an extremely hydrogen @-@ deficient supergiant thought to have arisen as the result of the merger of two white dwarfs ; fewer than 100 have been discovered as of 2012 . The dimming is thought to be caused by carbon dust expelled by the star . As of 2012 , four <unk> have been observed . PV Telescopii is a class B @-@ type ( blue ) extreme helium star that is the prototype of a class of variables known as PV Telescopii variables . First discovered in 1952 , it was found to have a very low level of hydrogen . One theory of its origin is that it is the result of a merger between a <unk> and a carbon @-@ oxygen white dwarf . If the combined mass does not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit , the former will accrete onto the latter star and ignite to form a supergiant . Later this will become an extreme helium star before cooling to become a white dwarf . 
 While RR Telescopii , also designated Nova Telescopii 1948 , is often called a slow nova , it is now classified as a symbiotic nova system composed of an M5III pulsating red giant and a white dwarf ; between 1944 and 1948 it brightened by about 7 magnitudes before being noticed at apparent magnitude 6 @.@ 0 in mid @-@ 1948 . It has since faded slowly to about apparent magnitude 12 . QS Telescopii is a binary system composed of a white dwarf and main sequence donor star , in this case the two are close enough to be tidally locked , facing one another . Known as polars , material from the donor star does not form an accretion disk around the white dwarf , but rather streams directly onto it . This is due to the presence of the white dwarf 's strong magnetic field . 
 Although no star systems in Telescopium have confirmed planets , several have been found to have brown dwarf companions . A member of the 12 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old Beta Pictoris moving group of stars that share a common proper motion through space , Eta Telescopii is a young white main sequence star of magnitude 5 @.@ 0 and spectral type A0V . It has a debris disk and brown dwarf companion of spectral type <unk> or <unk> that is between 20 and 50 times as massive as Jupiter . The system is complex , as it has a common proper motion with ( and is gravitationally bound to ) the star HD <unk> , which has its own debris disk . This latter star is a yellow @-@ white main sequence star of spectral type <unk> of magnitude 7 @.@ 0 . PZ Telescopii is another young star with a debris disk and substellar brown dwarf companion , though at 24 million years of age appears too old to be part of the Beta Pictoris moving group . HD <unk> is a yellow subgiant — a star that is cooling and expanding off the main sequence — of spectral type <unk> / V. Estimated to be just over four billion years old , it is slightly ( 1 @.@ 1 to 1 @.@ 3 times ) more massive as the Sun , 2 @.@ 69 times as luminous , and has around 1 @.@ 62 times its radius . Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher ( HARPS ) instrument on the ESO 3 @.@ 6 m Telescope , it was found to have a brown dwarf around 38 times as massive as Jupiter orbiting at an average distance of 1 @.@ 35 AU with a period of 505 days . This is an unusually close distance from the star , within a range that has been termed the brown @-@ dwarf desert .

 The globular cluster NGC <unk> lies near Theta Arae and is 45 @,@ 000 light @-@ years distant from Earth . It is an Oosterhoff type I cluster , and contains at least 69 variable stars , most of which are RR Lyrae variables . The planetary nebula IC <unk> is of 13th magnitude and lies midway between Alpha and Epsilon Telescopii . 
 IC 4889 is an elliptical galaxy of apparent magnitude 11 @.@ 3 , which can be found 2 degrees north @-@ north @-@ west of 5 @.@ 3 @-@ magnitude Nu Telescopii . Observing it through a 40 cm telescope will reveal its central region and halo . The Telescopium group is group of twelve galaxies spanning three degrees in the northeastern part of the constellation , lying around 37 megaparsecs ( 120 million light @-@ years ) from our own galaxy . The brightest member is the elliptical galaxy NGC <unk> , and to the west lies the spiral galaxy ( or , perhaps , lenticular galaxy ) NGC <unk> . These are the brightest members of two respective subgroups within the galaxy group , and are heading toward a merger in the future . Occupying an area of around 4 ' × 2 ' , NGC <unk> is an interacting system of four galaxies — two spiral and two lenticular galaxies — that is estimated to be around 88 megaparsecs ( 287 million light @-@ years ) distant . SN <unk> was a type II supernova observed in one of the spiral galaxies , NGC <unk> , in June 2008 .

 = The Absent @-@ Minded Beggar = 
 " The Absent @-@ Minded Beggar " is an 1899 poem by Rudyard Kipling , set to music by Sir Arthur Sullivan and often accompanied by an illustration by Richard Caton Woodville . The song was written as part of an appeal by the Daily Mail to raise money for soldiers fighting in the South African War ( usually known as the Boer War ) and their families . The fund was the first such charitable effort for a war . 
 The chorus of the song exhorted its audience to " pass the hat for your credit 's sake , and pay — pay — pay ! " The patriotic poem and song caused a sensation and were constantly performed throughout the war and beyond . Kipling was offered a knighthood shortly after publication of the poem but declined the honour . Vast numbers of copies of the poem and sheet music were published , and large quantities of related merchandise were sold to aid the charity . The " Absent @-@ Minded Beggar Fund " was an unprecedented success and raised a total of more than £ 250 @,@ 000 . 
 = = History = = 
 In September 1899 , it was clear that the crisis in South Africa was likely to turn into war . By 2 October , all military leave had been cancelled , and urgent preparations were under way to send a large expeditionary force to the Cape , with horses and supplies being requisitioned and mobilised . On 7 October , a proclamation was issued calling out the Army Reserve . Of 65 @,@ 000 liable men , around 25 @,@ 000 were intended to be called up for service . 
 Many , if not all , of the men thus mobilised were ex @-@ soldiers in permanent employment for whom returning to military duty meant a significant cut in their income . In addition , there was no contemporary legislation of the time protecting the permanent employment of Reservists . Employers could – and often would – replace them with other workers , with no guarantee that if the soldier returned he would be able to take back his job . As a result , many families were quickly plunged into poverty , since a lifestyle comfortably maintained on a workman 's wage of twenty shillings could not be kept up on the infantryman 's " shilling a day " . As if this were not enough , there was no guarantee that the husband would have a job to return to , even without the prospect of injury or death . A number of charitable funds existed to support these individuals , most notably the Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Families Association , but a number of private appeals were also made . 
 Simultaneously , a wave of patriotism was sweeping the country , catered to by jingoist newspapers such as the Daily Mail . Many of these newspapers were also involved in the charitable fundraising efforts to benefit the Reservists and their dependents . The Daily Mail proprietor , Alfred Harmsworth , had publicised efforts to help soldiers and their families . This drew the attention of Rudyard Kipling , who produced " The Absent @-@ Minded Beggar " on 16 October 1899 and sent the verses to Harmsworth on 22 October with a note that " they are at your service . ... turn [ the proceeds ] over to any one of the regularly ordained relief @-@ funds , as a portion of your contribution . I don 't want my name mixed up in the business except as it will help to get money . It 's <unk> verse and I want it to catch just as many pennies as it can . ... [ <unk> ] It isn 't a thing I shall care to reprint ; so there is no need of copyrighting it in America . If any one wants to sing it take care that the proceeds go to our men . " By 25 October , Kipling was plotting with Harmsworth on how to maximise the fundraising from the poem by having it recited at music halls . He suggested finding a composer to set it to a " common + catchy " tune . 
 The poem was first published in The Daily Mail on 31 October 1899 and was an immediate success . Maud Tree , the wife of actor @-@ manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree , recited it at the Palace Theatre , every night before the show , for fourteen months , and other performers recited it at music halls and elsewhere , giving part of the profits to the fund . The country 's premier composer , Sir Arthur Sullivan , was immediately asked to set the poem to music . Sullivan had written some 20 operas , including fourteen comic operas with W. S. Gilbert , and a large volume of songs , orchestral pieces and other music . Although he was in the middle of composing his next opera , The Rose of Persia ( which was to be his last completed opera ) , Sullivan agreed . Both Kipling and Sullivan declined proffered fees for creating the song . Artist Richard Caton Woodville , within several days , provided an illustration , titled " A Gentleman in <unk> " , showing a wounded but defiant British Tommy in battle . This illustration was included in " art editions " of the poem and song . 
 In 1897 , Sullivan had agreed to compose music for Rudyard Kipling 's poem <unk> , but he never completed the song . When asked to set " The Absent @-@ Minded Beggar " to music two years later , Sullivan found Kipling 's verses so difficult to set that he told his diary , " if it wasn 't for charity 's sake , I could never have undertaken the task " . Still , the experienced composer completed the music in four days , on 5 November 1899 . The first public performance was sung by John Coates , under Sullivan 's baton , at the Alhambra Theatre on 13 November 1899 , to a " magnificent reception " of an overflowing theatre . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Sullivan 's music captured Britain 's jingoistic mood , and Sullivan 's diary entry notes , " Wild enthusiasm . All sang chorus ! I stood on the stage and conducted the encore – funny sight ! " With characteristic grace , the composer wrote to Kipling , " Your splendid words went with a swing and enthusiasm which even my music cannot stifle " . Kipling , on the other hand , described the music as " a tune guaranteed to pull teeth out of barrel @-@ organs " . 
 The Daily Chronicle wrote that " It has not been often that the greatest of English writers and the greatest of English musicians have joined inspiring words and stirring melody in a song which expresses the heart feelings of the entire nation " . Sullivan 's manuscript was later auctioned for £ 500 towards the fund . Critic Fuller Maitland disapproved of the composition in The Times , but Sullivan asked a friend , " Did the idiot expect the words to be set in cantata form , or as a developed composition with symphonic introduction , contrapuntal treatment , etc . ? " 
 The poem , song and piano music sold in extraordinary numbers , as did all kinds of household items , postcards , memorabilia and other merchandise emblazoned , woven or engraved with the " Gentleman in <unk> " figure , the poem itself , the sheet music , or humorous illustrations . Some of these items were very expensive . 40 clerks answered 12 @,@ 000 requests a day for copies of the poem , and it was included in 148 @,@ 000 packets of cigarettes within two months of the first performance . Alternative arrangements of the song were published , such as " The Absent @-@ Minded Beggar March " . 
 The Daily Mail 's charitable fund was eventually titled the " Absent Minded Beggar Relief Corps " or the " Absent @-@ Minded Beggar Fund , " providing small comforts to the soldiers themselves as well as supporting their families . Among other activities of the Corps , it " met the soldiers on arrival in South Africa , welcomed them on their return to Britain and , more importantly , set up overseas centres to minister to the sick and wounded " . The fund raised the unprecedented amount of more than £ 250 @,@ 000 . The money was not raised solely by the Daily Mail ; the poem was publicly available , with anyone permitted to perform or print it in any way , so long as the copyright royalties went to the fund . Newspapers around the world published the poem , hundreds of thousands of copies were quickly sold internationally , and the song was sung widely in theatres and music halls , first being heard in Australia on 23 December 1899 . Local " Absent Minded Beggar Relief Corps " branches were opened in Trinidad , Cape Town , Ireland , New Zealand , China , India and numerous places throughout the world ; all of this contributed to the fund and to other war efforts , such as the building of hospitals . The fund was the first such charitable effort for a war and has been referred to as the origin of the welfare state . In December , after the first £ 50 @,@ 000 was raised , the Daily Mail asserted , " The history of the world can produce no parallel to the extraordinary record of this poem . " 
 The popularity of the poem was such that allusions to it were common . Mark Twain wrote that " The clarion @-@ peal of its lines thrilled the world " . By 18 November , less than a month after publication of the poem , " a new patriotic play " was advertised to open the next week , titled The Absent Minded Beggar , or , For Queen and Country . The same month , the Charity Organisation Society called " The Absent @-@ Minded Beggar " the " most prominent figure on the charitable horizon at present . " Even a critical book on the conduct of the war , published in 1900 , was titled An Absent @-@ Minded War . Kipling was offered a knighthood within a few weeks of publication of the song but declined , as he declined all offers of State honours . Historian Stephen M. Miller wrote in 2007 , " Kipling almost single @-@ handedly restored the strong ties between civilians and soldiers and put Britain and its army back together again . " 
 A performance of " The Absent @-@ Minded Beggar March " on 21 July 1900 at The Crystal Palace was Sullivan 's last public appearance , and the composer died four months later . " The Absent @-@ Minded Beggar " remained popular throughout the three @-@ year war and for years after the war ended . It became a part of popular culture of the time , with its title becoming a popular phrase and cartoons , postcards and other humorous representations of the character of the absent @-@ minded beggar becoming popular . The song is performed in John Osborne 's 1957 play The Entertainer .

 = Andriyivskyy Descent = 
 Andriyivskyy Descent ( Ukrainian : <unk> <unk> , <unk> ’ kyi <unk> , literally : Andrew 's Descent ) is a historic descent connecting Kiev 's Upper Town neighborhood and the historically commercial Podil neighborhood . The street , often advertised by tour guides and operators as the " Montmartre of Kiev " , is a major tourist attraction of the city . 
 The descent , 720 metres ( 2 @,@ 360 ft ) in length , is constructed of laid cobblestones . It winds down steeply around the Zamkova Hora hill , ending near the <unk> Square in the Podil . The Andriyivskyy Descent is marked by a couple historic landmarks , including the Castle of Richard the Lionheart , the 18th century baroque Saint Andrew 's Church , famed Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakov 's house , and numerous other monuments . 
 Recent talk of the descent 's reconstruction has been going since 2006 , when a local grassroots organization aimed at saving the Andriyivskyy Descent collected more than 1 @,@ 000 signatures to petition local authorities to take action on the descent 's reconstruction . On June 23 , 2009 , the Kiev City Council administration approved the reconstruction of the <unk> Descent , which was officially announced a year earlier by Mayor Leonid <unk> . The exact timeline for reconstruction has not yet been adopted , although the reconstruction 's budget has been drafted in the city 's 2010 budget . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Andriyivskyy Descent begins on the summit of the <unk> Hora ( Old Kiev mountain ) near the ornate late @-@ baroque Saint Andrew 's Church ( which gave the street its current name ) . The street continues on down and descends to the Podil district where it ends at the <unk> Square . In the past times , the descent was known as the <unk> Descent mentioned as " <unk> <unk> " ( Old East Slavic : <unk> <unk> ) by Nestor the Chronicler in his Primary Chronicle and in the 12th century poem , The Tale of Igor 's Campaign ( Slovo o <unk> <unk> ) . The descent 's current name is derived from the 18th century , at the time when the Saint Andrew 's Church was erected atop the hill . 
 In the 18th and 19th centuries , the street was mainly inhabited by merchants and craftspeople . Although they are long gone due to the sweeping demographic changes in Kiev during times of the late Russian Empire and the Soviet Union , the street is once again thriving thanks to its unique topology , architecture , rich history and also many gift shops and small art galleries showcasing various paintings and sculptures by Ukrainian artists . The descent is one of the favorite spots for tourists . It is also notable for the many festivals it holds , including various art festivals and the Kiev Day celebrations on the last weekend of May . 
 The street 's location in the city and its landmark attraction has made it lately a highly prestigious area , with several new luxurious restaurants . However , the descent 's sewer and water systems have not been upgraded within the past 100 years , thereby underlining the need for a new system to be installed . Although , city authorities have not yet scheduled a new sewer project system to be installed . 
 = = History = = 
 The descent , located between two hills , is the shortest passageway from the historic Old or Upper Town ( Ukrainian : <unk> <unk> ; <unk> ’ ka Hora ) to the commercial Podil neighborhood . One of the hills , known as <unk> ’ <unk> , was the place where pre @-@ Christian idols once stood ( see : Baptism of Kiev ) , and another hill , called Zamkova Hora , served as a castle hill during the Middle Ages . For many centuries , this passageway was very steep and inconvenient , that 's the reason why there are were not any settlements for a long time . The first buildings were erected here only in the 17th century , and the first apartment buildings began appearing towards the end of the 19th century . 
 In 1711 , by the order of then @-@ Governor of Kiev , the route between the Zamkova and Andriyivskyy mountains were expanded , thus allowing traffic to become more suitable for horses and wagon carriages . The Andriyivskyy Descent was renamed in 1920 in honor of young revolutionary Georgiy Liver . In 1944 , it was decided to return the street to its prior name ; in 1957 , the street was renamed back to <unk> Spusk — the Russian variant of Andriyivskyy Descent . In the 1980s , the Andriyivskyy Descent received a thorough reconstruction after years of disrepair . 
 On April 9 , 2012 , construction workers began demolishing legally protected historic structures , even though earlier that year , their safety was guaranteed at several news conferences and the buildings themselves were included in scale models of the " renovated " descent . The destruction of the buildings took place under the guise of " reconstruction " efforts , which began in October 2011 . Preliminary reports indicate that the buildings directly across from , and next to the Museum of <unk> , ( Buildings 10a , 10b , and 9 / 11 ) were all razed to the ground . The land was being redeveloped to make room for a new office and business complex to house Rinat Akhmetov 's Kyiv operations . 
 Several hundred protestors , including boxer / politician Vitali Klitschko , gathered outside the main Kyiv office of Akhmetov ’ s SCM Holdings . On April 12 , Akhmetov claimed he had canceled plans to build a multi @-@ story business center in the buildings ’ place , promising instead to build a cultural center and restore the facades .

 The <unk> Descent contains numerous historic attractions and museums . The 18th century baroque Saint Andrew 's Church ; the late 19th century Mikhail Bulgakov 's house @-@ museum ; the 20th century Castle of Richard the Lionheart ; the Museum of One Street , chronicling the Andriyivskyy Descent 's history ; and numerous other monuments attract tourists and <unk> alike to the area . 
 = = = Saint Andrew 's Church = = = 
 Another attraction of the Andriyivskyy Descent is the baroque Saint Andrew 's Church . It is located atop a hill overlooking the Podil neighborhood from the Andriyivskyy Descent . The idea to construct the Saint Andrew 's Church came from the Russian <unk> Elizabeth Petrovna . When she visited Kiev in 1747 – 1754 , she laid the foundation brick of the church with her own hand , after which the church was constructed , to a design by the imperial architect Bartolomeo <unk> . 
 As the <unk> planned to take personal care of the church , the church has no parish , and there is no belltower to call the congregation to divine service . But she died before the construction ended , so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna . After Elizabeth 's death , the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in the church , last consecrated in 1767 . Later , there were not enough funds to maintain the church , which left the maintaining of the church to private and voluntary funds , such as Andrey <unk> . 
 In 1963 , <unk> 's original plans for the building were found in Vienna , Austria . This made it possible to reconstruct the original images on the building . The plan of restoration was carried out in the 1970s , overlooked by the main architect @-@ restorer , V. <unk> . Since 1968 , the church has been opened as a museum to tourists and visitors . The church is now owned by the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church . 
 = = = Castle of Richard the Lionheart = = = 
 The " Castle of Richard the Lionheart " house was built from 1902 – 1904 . It was originally supposed to be called Orlov House in reference to its constructor Dmitry Orlov . But because its owner failed to clear the house construction with the city 's authorities , a major scandal arose . Viktor Nekrasov named the building " The Castle of Richard the Lionheart " , after the 12th century English king in his book . It has been established that the modernized Gothic fronts were practically copied from a published design for a Saint Petersburg building by the architect R. <unk> . But the stunning relief of Andriyivskyy Descent softened the effect of this plagiarism . 
 The cellar of the building contained a barber 's shop , a grocery store and a butcher shop . The remaining premises were used as apartments for rent . When Dimitri Orlov died in 1911 while building a railroad in the Russian Far East , his widow , left with five children , had to sell off the house to pay her family 's debts . In 1983 , renovation works were started on the building to convert it into a hotel . Since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 , various reconstruction works have been largely unsuccessful . As of 2009 , the Castle of Richard the Lionheart still stands empty and fenced off in renovation . 
 = = = Mikhail Bulgakov 's house = = = 
 Mikhail Bulgakov , a famous Kiev @-@ born Russian writer , and his family lived on the street at two different houses in the early @-@ 20th century . In Bulgakov 's novel The White Guard the author vividly describes the street and house ( he calls it Aleksey Descent - " <unk> Spusk " ) in the turbulent times of the 1917 Russian Revolution . The address , at No.13 Andriyivskyy Descent is still commonly called the Bulgakov House and displays a plaque with the address the writer used in his book ( No.13 <unk> Spusk ) ( see image ) . Popular writer 's statue is also installed near museum . 
 A museum was opened inside the preserved building to mark the 100th birthday of Mikhail Bulgakov on May 15 , 1991 . The upper floor of the museum houses an exhibition of various Bulgakov objects , and the lower floor contains thematic exhibitions . The house , built in 1888 and designed by architect N. <unk> , was thoroughly renovated before the opening of the museum . A memorial plaque with Bulgakov 's portrait is now hanging on the front of the building . 
 = = = One Street Museum = = = 
 The One Street Museum is another main attraction of the Andriyivskyy Descent , which houses many of the historic items of the descent , containing more than 6 @,@ 500 exhibits . They include information about the Saint Andrew 's Church , the castle of Richard Lionheart , and the many other buildings of the Descent . 
 Also , the museum has a unique collection of various works by Ukrainian philologist P. <unk> , Arabist and professor of the Kiev University T. <unk> , journalist and public figure <unk> , Ukrainian writer <unk> , which have lived in the house No. 34 in the different periods of the twentieth century . Another important part of the collection in the museum is the memorabilia of professors of Kiev Theological Academy A. Bulgakov , S. Golubev , P. <unk> , F. Titov , <unk> , famed doctors Th . <unk> and D. Popov , and other prominent local figures . 
 The museum also has a large collection of antique books . Book relics of the exposition include a famous <unk> of the Metropolitan of Kiev Petro <unk> , rare editions of works written by professors and graduates of the Kyiv @-@ <unk> Academy , unique books written by the Ukrainian Walter Scott , <unk> , the Defender of Orthodoxy , <unk> , and the works of Mikhail Bulgakov published in his lifetime . 
 = = = Monuments = = = 
 The Andriyivskyy Descent also has a number of monuments . One of them is the monument to Yaroslav the Wise , the Grand Prince of Novgorod and Kiev , which depicts him holding a model of the Saint Sophia Cathedral . Another is the monument to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which was unveiled in 1989 , depicting two characters , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , from the play Chasing Two Rabbits , which was written by Mykhailo <unk> . Another main monument on the street is dedicated to the famous Ukrainian poet and artist Taras Shevchenko , located to the right of the monument to Yaroslav the Wise . Most recently , a monument to Mikhail Bulgakov was opened on the Andriyivskyy Descent , the first dedicated to the writer in the former Soviet Union . 
 = = Legends = = 
 During its long history , the Andriyivskyy Descent has a couple of legends surround it . 
 One legend states that when Andrew the Apostle visited the uninhabited mountains in the mid @-@ stream of the Dnieper River ( today 's <unk> Descent area ) , he put up a cross atop of the hill where the descent starts and prophesied a foundation of a great Christian city . Since that time , wooden churches sprang up around in the vicinity , completing his prophecy . 
 According to another legend , there was once a sea where the Dnieper River now flows . When Saint Andrew came to Kiev and erected a cross on the place where the Saint Andrew 's Church now stands , the sea went away . The only part that remained of the sea is under the mountain on which Kiev sits today . When the church was built there in the 18th century , a spring opened under the altar . The church has no bells , because , according to the legend , when the first bell strikes , the water can revive again and flood the left bank of Kiev .

 = Peng Dehuai = 
 Peng Dehuai ( Peng Te @-@ <unk> ; simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ; Wade – Giles : P <unk> Te2 @-@ <unk> ) ( October 24 , 1898 – November 29 , 1974 ) was a prominent Chinese Communist military leader , and served as China 's Defense Minister from 1954 to 1959 . Peng was born into a poor peasant family , and received several years of primary education before his family 's poverty forced him to suspend his education at the age of ten , and to work for several years as a manual laborer . When he was sixteen , Peng became a professional soldier . Over the next ten years Peng served in the armies of several Hunan @-@ based warlord armies , raising himself from the rank of private second class to major . In 1926 Peng 's forces joined the Kuomintang , and Peng was first introduced to communism . Peng participated in the Northern Expedition , and supported Wang Jingwei 's attempt to form a left @-@ leaning Kuomintang government based in Wuhan . After Wang was defeated , Peng briefly rejoined Chiang Kai @-@ shek 's forces before joining the Chinese Communist Party , allying himself with Mao Zedong and Zhu De . 
 Peng was one of the most senior generals who defended the Jiangxi Soviet from Chiang 's attempts to capture it , and his successes were rivaled only by Lin Biao . Peng participated in the Long March , and supported Mao Zedong at the Zunyi Conference , which was critical to Mao 's rise to power . During the 1937 – 1945 Second Sino @-@ Japanese War , Peng was one of the strongest supporters of pursuing a ceasefire with the Kuomintang in order to concentrate China 's collective resources on resisting the Japanese Empire . Peng was the senior commander in the combined Kuomintang @-@ Communist efforts to resist the Japanese occupation of Shanxi in 1937 ; and , by 1938 , was in command of 2 / 3 of the Eighth Route Army . In 1940 , Peng conducted the Hundred Regiments Offensive , a massive Communist effort to disrupt Japanese logistical networks across northern China . The Hundred Regiments Offensive was modestly successful , but political disputes within the Communist Party led to Peng being recalled to Yan 'an , and he spent the rest of the war without an active command . After the Japanese surrendered , in 1945 , Peng was given command of Communist forces in Northwest China . He was the most senior commander responsible for defending the Communist leadership in Shaanxi from Kuomintang forces , saving Mao from being captured at least once . Peng eventually defeated the Kuomintang in Northwest China , captured huge amounts of military supplies , and actively incorporated the huge area , including Xinjiang , into the People 's Republic of China . 
 Peng was one of the few senior military leaders who supported Mao 's suggestions to involve China directly in the 1950 – 1953 Korean War , and he served as the direct commander of the Chinese People 's Volunteer Army for the first half of the war ( though Mao and Zhou Enlai were technically more senior ) . Peng 's experiences in the Korean War convinced him that the Chinese military had to become more professional , organized , and well @-@ equipped in order to prepare itself for the conditions of modern technical warfare . Because the Soviet Union was the only communist country then equipped with a fully modern , professional army , Peng attempted to reform China 's military on the Soviet model over the next several years , making the army less political and more professional ( contrary to the political goals of Mao ) . Peng resisted Mao 's attempts to develop a personality cult throughout the 1950s ; and , when Mao 's economic policies associated with the Great Leap Forward caused a nationwide famine , Peng became critical of Mao 's leadership . The rivalry between Peng and Mao culminated in an open confrontation between the two at the 1959 Lushan Conference . Mao won this confrontation , labeled Peng as a leader of an " anti @-@ Party clique " , and purged Peng from all influential positions for the rest of his life . 
 Peng lived in virtual obscurity until 1965 , when the reformers Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping supported Peng 's limited return to government , developing military industries in Southwest China . In 1966 , following the advent of the Cultural Revolution , Peng was arrested by Red Guards . From 1966 – 1970 , radical factions within the Communist Party , led by Lin Biao and Mao 's wife , Jiang Qing , singled out Peng for national persecution , and Peng was publicly humiliated in numerous large @-@ scale struggle sessions and subjected to physical and psychological torture in organized efforts to force Peng to confess his " crimes " against Mao Zedong and the Communist Party . In 1970 Peng was formally tried and sentenced to life imprisonment , and he died in prison in 1974 . After Mao died in 1976 , Peng 's old ally , Deng Xiaoping , emerged as China 's paramount leader . Deng led an effort to formally rehabilitate people who had been unjustly persecuted during the Cultural Revolution , and Peng was one of the first leaders to be posthumously rehabilitated , in 1978 . In modern China , Peng is considered one of the most successful and highly respected generals in the history of the early Chinese Communist Party . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Childhood = = = 
 Peng was born in 1898 in the village of <unk> , Xiangtan County , Hunan . His personal name at birth was " Dehua " . Peng 's family lived in a thatched @-@ straw hut and owned approximately 1 @.@ 5 acres of irrigated land , on which the family grew bamboo , sweet potatoes , tea , cotton , and various vegetables . His father also operated a bean curd shop . The income from the land and shop supported an extended family of eight people , including Peng , his three brothers , his parents , his grandmother , and a grand @-@ uncle . Peng 's grand @-@ uncle had joined and fought for the Taiping rebellion , and used to tell Peng about the old Taiping ideals : that everyone should have enough food to eat , that women should not bind their feet , and that land should be redistributed equally . Peng later described his own class background as " lower @-@ middle peasant " . 
 From 1905 – 1907 , Peng was enrolled in a traditional Confucian primary school . In 1908 Peng attended a modern primary school ; but , at the age of ten , was forced to withdraw from this school due to his family 's deteriorating financial situation . In 1905 – 1906 , there was a severe drought in Hunan . Peng 's mother died in 1905 , and Peng 's six @-@ month @-@ old brother died of hunger . Peng 's father was forced to sell most of his family possessions for food , and to pawn most of his family 's land . When Peng was withdrawn from school in 1908 , he and his brothers were sent to beg for food in their village . From 1908 – 1910 , Peng took a job looking after a pair of water buffaloes . 
 When Peng 's grand @-@ uncle died in 1911 , Peng left home and worked at a coalmine in Xiangtan , where he pushed carts of coal for thirteen hours a day for a wage of nine yuan a month . In 1912 , shortly after the founding of the Republic of China , the mine went bankrupt and the owners fled , cheating Peng out of half his annual wages . Peng returned home in 1912 and took a number of odd jobs . In 1913 Hunan suffered another drought , and Peng participated in a public demonstration that escalated into the seizure of a grain merchant 's storehouse , and the redistribution of grain among the peasants . Village police issued a warrant for Peng 's arrest , and he fled to northern Hunan , where he worked for two years as a construction laborer for the construction of a dam near Dongting Lake . When the dam was completed , in 1916 , Peng assumed that he was no longer in danger of being arrested and returned home , joining the army of a local Kuomintang @-@ aligned warlord , Tang <unk> . 
 = = = Service in warlord armies = = = 
 Peng enlisted as a private second class , with a monthly wage of 5 @.@ 5 yuan , 2 yuan of which he sent back to support his family . Within seven months he was promoted to private first class , with a monthly wage of 6 yuan , 3 yuan of which he sent to his family . One of Peng 's commanding officers was an idealistic Nationalist who had participated in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution , who influenced Peng to sympathize with the Kuomintang goals of social reform and national reunification . When another civil war broke out in 1917 , Peng 's regiment split from the rest of its army and joined the forces of Tang Shengzhi , who was aligned with Tan <unk> and Sun Yat @-@ sen , against those aligned with the northern warlord Wu Peifu . During this period Peng received training in formal tactics from an officer in his brigade . In July 1918 Peng was captured while on a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines , but was released after two weeks . In April 1919 Peng was promoted to master sergeant and acting platoon commander . Tang Shengzhi 's forces drove enemy troops out of Hunan in July 1920 , capturing the provincial capital of Changsha . 
 Peng participated in a failed mutiny over pay , but was pardoned . In August 1921 Peng was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant , and became acting company commander several weeks later . While stationed in a village in <unk> , Peng noticed that the poor were being mistreated by a local landlord , and encouraged them to establish an " association to help the poor " . When the local villagers hesitated , Peng ordered his soldiers to arrest the landlord and execute him . Peng was reprimanded for his actions , but not demoted or reassigned . After the incident , Peng began to think seriously about leaving the service of his provincial warlord army . On February 1922 , after applying for extended unpaid leave , Peng and several other officers traveled to Guangdong to seek employment in the army of the Kuomintang . 
 Peng 's impression of the Kuomintang in 1922 was not favorable , and he left Guangzhou with the intention of settling back in Hunan as a farmer . Peng returned to his home village by sea via Shanghai ( then the farthest he had ever been from his home village ) , and farmed with his father for three months on land which his father had bought with money that Peng had sent home , but Peng did not find this occupation satisfying . When one of Peng 's old comrades suggested that Peng apply to the local Hunan Military Academy to seek employment as a formally trained professional officer , Peng accepted . Peng successfully gained admission in August 1922 , using the personal name " Dehuai " for the first time . In August 1923 , after nine months of training , Peng graduated from the academy and rejoined his old regiment with the rank of captain . He was promoted to acting battalion commander in April 1924 . 
 In 1924 Tang Shengzhi aligned himself with northern warlords against the warlord controlling Guangdong , who was aligned with the Kuomintang . Peng conducted skirmishes along the Hunan @-@ Guangdong border for nine months , but reorganized his battalion along pro @-@ Kuomintang political lines in 1925 . In late 1925 Chiang Kai @-@ shek established the National Revolutionary Army ( NRA ) and led the Kuomintang to take control of Guangdong . Tang then aligned himself with Chiang and joined him in the Northern Expedition , an effort to unify China by defeating the northern warlords . The Hunanese army was reorganized , and Peng was promoted to the rank of major . When Wu Peifu invaded Hunan and occupied Changsha , Chiang sent the NRA to Hunan , beginning the Northern Expedition . Peng 's forces then joined the Kuomintang , though Peng never joined the party as a formal member . It wasn 't until after Peng joined the Kuomintang , in 1925 , that he first heard of the Communist Party . 
 = = = Kuomintang officer = = = 
 Between July 1926 and March 1927 Peng campaigned in Hunan , participating in the capture of Changsha and Wuhan . Under general Ho Chien ( <unk> ) , Peng participated in the Battle of <unk> , in which Kuomintang forces decisively defeated the warlord Wu Peifu . In 1927 , Wang Jingwei attempted to establish a left @-@ leaning Kuomintang government in Wuhan that threatened Chiang Kai @-@ shek 's leadership . Tang Shengzhi , who Peng served under , aligned himself with Wang , and Peng was promoted to lieutenant @-@ colonel and regimental commander . After Tang 's forces were decisively defeated by Chiang , Peng commanded the rear guard , protecting the retreat of Tang 's forces back into Hunan . 
 In 1927 Peng was approached several times by Communist Party members , some of which were old friends , who attempted to recruit him into the Communist Party . In August 1927 Peng was approached by an old military comrade , Huang <unk> ( <unk> ) : Peng was sympathetic , but could not decide to join the Party . On October 12 , Peng was approached by Duan <unk> ( <unk> ) , a Communist Party representative : Peng again expressed sympathy and interest , but at that time considered himself a member of the " Kuomintang left wing " , and could not yet bring himself to break with the party . Peng considered joining the Communist Party for some time , met Duan again later that October , and began to study basic communist theory . Peng secretly joined the Chinese Communist Party in mid @-@ February 1928 . 
 In February 1928 Peng joined general Ho Chien when Ho defected back to Chiang 's forces , and gained a promotion to full colonel after rejoining Chiang . After rejoining Chiang 's Nanjing government , Peng was stationed in the mountainous <unk> County , northwest of Changsha . His orders were to eliminate local groups of communist guerrillas who had fled to the area following the Shanghai massacre of 1927 . Because Peng had secretly joined the Chinese Communist Party , he instead kept his unit passive and began to organize local Communist Party branches . Peng made contact with local communist guerillas , nominally attached to the forces of Mao Zedong and Zhu De , and decided to issue a pronouncement in favor of the Communists on July 18 , 1928 . 
 In July 22 , 1928 Peng 's forces , approximately 2000 men , occupied <unk> County , arresting and executing the county magistrate and over 100 landlords and local militia commanders . On July 23 Peng declared the establishment of the " Hunan Provincial Soviet Government " , formally aligning himself with Mao and Zhu . On July 29 Peng 's former superior , general Ho Chien , attacked Peng 's forces , inflicting heavy casualties . By September , Peng 's forces were driven into the mountains , and by October only several hundred men remained . Peng then abandoned his bases and left to join Mao and Zhu at their base in Jinggangshan . Peng 's forces successfully joined Mao and Zhu in November 1928 . Some of Peng 's subordinates in the rebellion survived and became important military figures themselves , including generals Huang Kecheng and Peng <unk> ( <unk> ) .

 = = = Defending the Jiangxi Soviet = = = 
 After joining forces with communist guerrillas , one of Peng 's first actions was to save Mao , whose forces were being encircled by Kuomintang units : Peng broke the encirclement and drove the enemy off . Peng then met with Zhu and Mao , and they reorganized their forces and decided to form a base area around the Ruijin , Jiangxi , an agricultural city that was only defended by weak warlord units . Zhu and Mao occupied the area , informally beginning the Jiangxi Soviet in January 1929 . 
 Peng remained behind to guard Jinggangshan with a force of 800 soldiers , but withdrew from the area when it was attacked by a Hunanese Kuomintang force of 25 @,@ 000 soldiers , joining Zhu and Mao in Ruijin in March . Although he had saved his force from destruction , he was criticized by Mao for withdrawing . Peng returned to Jinggangshan with a force of 1 @,@ 000 men later that year , occupying the area after the Kuomintang withdrew . In mid @-@ 1929 Peng 's forces merged with the forces of two local bandit groups , but conflicts arose over supplies and the command structure , and the two groups rebelled against Peng in July 1929 . One of the bandit leaders was captured and executed by Peng , and the other committed suicide . The remaining forces were incorporated into Peng 's unit , bringing its strength up to 2 @,@ 000 men . Peng then organized a series of increasingly ambitious raids into southern Hunan throughout 1929 and 1930 , capturing an increasing amount of supplies and attracting more recruits . 
 On July 13 , 1930 , the de facto leader of the Chinese Communist Party , Li Lisan , issued a general order for communist units around China to " conquer one provincial capital " as a signal for a " nationwide revolutionary storm " . Peng took these general orders seriously , and launched an attack on Hunan 's capital , Changsha , on July 25 , with 17 @,@ 000 soldiers under his command , and with the support of another 10 @,@ 000 guerillas . Changsha was then defended by general Ho Chien , Peng 's former superior . Peng 's forces broke through the Kuomintang lines on July 28 , and occupied Changsha proper on July 30 , which Ho hastily evacuated . On August 1 Peng declared the establishment of a " Hunan Provincial Soviet Government " , with Li Lisan ( who was living in the French concession area in Shanghai ) named chairman , and Peng himself as vice @-@ chairman . On August 5 , Ho counterattacked with a force of 35 @,@ 000 men . Peng suffered 7 @,@ 500 casualties , and was forced to withdraw back to Jinggangshan . On September 1 , Peng again attempted to capture Changsha , but this attack was halted on the outskirts of the city with heavy casualties . Mao and Zhu kept their own forces from assisting Peng during his attempts to take Changsha , and Peng withdrew his forces into the Jiangxi Soviet in late 1930 . 
 Peng was one of the most important generals active in defending the Jiangxi Soviet , taking a leading role in defeating Chiang Kai @-@ shek 's first three Encirclement Campaigns , from December 1930 – May 1931 . His successes were outmatched only by Lin Biao . On November 7 , Peng was named to the Central Military Commission and to the Central Executive Committee of the Jiangxi Soviet , the first time that he had been named to a position of political leadership within the communist movement . After the consolidation of the Jiangxi Soviet , a number of USSR @-@ trained Communist Party leaders arrived and took power in the Soviet : Peng , like most communist military leaders , supported their leadership until the Jiangxi Soviet was eventually overrun . In August 1933 , Peng was named Vice @-@ Chairman of the Central Military Commission ; and , in January 1934 , Peng was appointed as an alternate member to the Sixth CCP Central Committee . Peng continued the defense of the Jiangxi Soviet throughout the early 1930s . In August 1933 , after the indecisive Fourth Encirclement Campaign , Peng broke through Kuomintang defenses and conquered a large area of western Fujian , capturing great quantities of arms and ammunition . 
 = = = The Long March = = = 
 In October 1933 Chiang Kai @-@ shek took command of nearly 800 @,@ 000 soldiers , leading the Fifth Encirclement Campaign against the Red Army 's force of 150 @,@ 000 men . By September 1934 the Fifth Encirclement Campaign was largely successful , and Peng 's own units suffered heavy casualties defending the Soviet , shrinking from 35 @,@ 000 to around 20 @,@ 000 men . On October 20 , 1934 the communists broke out of Chiang 's encirclement and began the Long March . Of the 18 @,@ 000 men under Peng 's command when the March began , only about 3 @,@ 000 remained when Peng 's forces reached their eventual destination in Shaanxi on October 20 , 1935 . 
 Peng was a strong supporter of Mao 's rise to power during the January 1935 Zunyi Conference . Peng continued to consolidate the communists ' base area after arriving in Shaanxi , campaigning in neighboring Shanxi and Gansu . In April 1937 , Peng was named vice commander @-@ in @-@ chief of all Chinese communist forces , outranked only by Zhu De , who was named commander @-@ in @-@ chief . Peng 's promotion was supported by Lin Biao , who had been actively supporting Peng for promotions to senior leadership as early as May 1934 . In early 1935 Lin responded to widespread discontent within the Red Army over Mao 's evasive tactics ( which were perceived inside the Red Army as unnecessarily exhausting ) by publicly proposing that Peng take overall command of the Red Army ; but Mao , who had recently been promoted to the position , attacked Peng and Lin for challenging him and successfully retained his position . 
 In October 1935 , following the last major battle between the KMT and the Red Army , Mao wrote and dedicated a poem to Peng . ( The poem was not published until 1947 ) . 
 The mountains are high , the road is long and full of potholes , 
 Many soldiers are moving to and fro , 
 Who is the courageous one , striking from his horse in all directions ? 
 None other than our great General Peng !

 In 1936 the American journalist , Edgar Snow , stayed for several days at Peng 's compound in <unk> while Peng was campaigning in Ningxia , and had long conversations with him . Snow wrote two whole chapters about Peng in his book , Red Star Over China . He wrote more about Peng than any other individual , except for Mao Zedong .

 After the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident , China and Japan formally went to war . When the Kuomintang and Communist Party declared a united front to fight the Japanese , Peng was confirmed as a general in the unified command structure of the NRA . At the August 20 , 1937 <unk> Conference ( <unk> ) , Mao believed that the united front should be used as a feint , giving token resistance to the Japanese while saving the strength of the Red Army for the eventual confrontation with the Kuomintang , but Peng , along with most other senior military and political leaders at the time , disagreed , and believed that the Red Army should genuinely focus on fighting the Japanese . Mao was not able to force his position , and the communists cooperated with the Kuomintang and fought the Japanese . 
 When the Japanese invaded Shanxi , the Red Army ( renamed the Eighth Route Army ) assisted the Kuomintang warlord , Yan <unk> , in resisting the Japanese , and Peng travelled to the provincial capital of Taiyuan with Zhou Enlai to coordinate tactics . After the Japanese advanced towards Taiyuan on September 13 , 1937 , Peng directed overall operations from a base in <unk> , but was called from duty to attend a Politburo meeting on December 13 . At the meeting , Peng advocated a greater material commitment to the defense of Shanxi , but Mao disagreed and wanted the Red Army to reduce its commitment to fighting the Japanese . In 1938 , after Mao 's rival , Zhang Guotao , defected to the Kuomintang , Peng moved closer to Mao 's position . In late 1938 , Peng set up a base in Taihangshan , on the borders of Shanxi and Hebei , and directed guerrilla operations in both provinces . From Taihangshan , Peng commanded 2 / 3 of the Eighth Route Army , approximately 100 @,@ 000 soldiers . 
 In July 1940 Peng was given overall command of the largest communist operation of the anti @-@ Japanese war , the Hundred Regiments Offensive . 200 @,@ 000 regular troops from the Eighth Route Army participated in this operation , supported by 200 @,@ 000 irregular communist guerrillas . From August 20 – October 5 , 1940 , communist forces destroyed large numbers of bridges , tunnels , and railroad tracks in Japanese @-@ occupied China , and inflicted relatively heavy Japanese casualties . From October 6 – December 5 , the Japanese counterattacked , and the communists mostly repelled the counterattack successfully . Peng 's operation was successful in disrupting Japanese communication lines and logistics networks , which were not fully restored until 1942 , but the communists suffered heavy losses , In communist sources , the Japanese casualties have two figures , one of which is <unk> and the other of which is <unk> . Foreign sources give figures of <unk> . In early 1941 , the Japanese began a large @-@ scale effort to drive Peng from his base in Taihangshan , and Peng relocated closer to the communist base in Yan 'an in late 1941 . 
 After being recalled to Yan 'an , Peng was subjected to a political indoctrination campaign in which he was criticized as an " empiricist " for his good relations with the Comintern , and only survived professionally through an unconditional conversion to Mao 's leadership . Mao ordered Peng to be criticized for forty days for the " failings " of the Hundred Regiments Campaign ( even though Mao had supported it , and afterwards praised its successes ) . Peng was not allowed to reply , and was forced to make a self @-@ criticism . Privately , Peng resented Mao 's criticism of him , and in 1959 once told Mao : " At Yan 'an , you fucked my mother for forty days . " 
 From 1942 – 1945 , Peng 's role in the war was mostly political , and he supported Mao very closely . In June 1944 Peng was part of a team that <unk> with American military personnel that visited Yan 'an as part of the Dixie Mission , briefing the Americans about the military situation in Japanese @-@ occupied China .

 The Japanese surrendered on September 3 , 1945 , ending China 's war with Japan and beginning the final stage of the Chinese Civil War . In October Peng took command of troops in northern China , occupied Inner Mongolia , and accepted the surrender of Japanese soldiers there . In March 1946 , Communist forces ( 1 @.@ 1 million soldiers ) were renamed the " People 's Liberation Army " . Peng himself was placed in command of 175 @,@ 000 soldiers , organized as the " Northwest Field Army " , most of which had been under the command of He Long during the war against Japan . He then became Peng 's second @-@ in @-@ command . Peng 's notable subordinates in the Northwest Field Army included Zhang <unk> and Wang Zhen . 
 Peng 's forces were the most poorly armed of the newly reorganized army , but were responsible for the area around the communist capital , Yan 'an . In March 1947 , the Kuomintang general , Hu <unk> , invaded this area with 260 @,@ 000 soldiers . Hu 's forces were among the best @-@ trained and most well @-@ supplied Nationalist units , but one of Zhou Enlai 's spies was able to provide Peng with information about Hu 's strategic plans , his forces ' troop distributions , strength , and positions , and details about the air cover available to Hu . Peng was forced to abandon Yan 'an in late March , but resisted Hu 's forces long enough for Mao and other senior Party leaders to evacuate safely . Mao wanted Peng to provoke a decisive confrontation with Hu immediately , but Peng dissuaded him , and by April Mao agreed that Peng 's objective was to " keep the enemy on the run ... tire him out completely , reduce his food supplies , and then look for an opportunity to destroy him " . 
 On May 4 Peng 's forces attacked an isolated supply depot in northeast Shaanxi , arrested its commander , and captured food reserves , 40 @,@ 000 army uniforms , and a collection of arms that included over a million pieces of artillery . Peng 's forces were pushed back to the border of Inner Mongolia , but finally managed to decisively defeat Hu 's forces in August , in the Battle of <unk> ( <unk> ) , saving Mao and other members from the Central committee from being taken prisoner . Peng eventually pushed Kuomintang forces out of Shaanxi in February 1948 . 
 Between 1947 and September 22 , 1949 , Peng 's forces occupied Gansu , Ningxia , and Qinghai . His forces repeatedly defeated , but were not able to destroy , the forces of Hu <unk> and Ma <unk> , which retreated into Sichuan and were airlifted to Taiwan when the Kuomintang lost the Civil War in December 1949 . In October Peng 's forces , led directly by Wang Zhen , invaded Xinjiang . Most of Xinjiang 's defenders surrendered peacefully , and were incorporated as a new unit in Peng 's army , but some ethnic guerrilla bands resisted Chinese control for several years . After the People 's Republic of China was declared on October 1 , 1949 , Peng was appointed Chairman of the Northwest China Military and Administrative Commission and Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief and Political Commissar of Xinjiang , with Wang Zhen as his deputy . This appointment gave Peng responsibility over Shaanxi , Gansu , Ningxia , Qinghai , and Xinjiang , an area of over five million square kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 million square miles ) but under thirty million people . Peng 's forces continued their gradual occupation of Xinjiang , which they completed in September 1951 . 
 = = The Korean War = = 
 North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25 , 1950 . After receiving its endorsement from the United Nations , the United States landed its first troops in Korea on September 15 . On October 1 , the first anniversary of the founding of the People 's Republic , UN forces crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea . There was some disagreement within China 's leadership about how to react to the American push to the Chinese border : Mao and Zhou wanted direct military intervention , while most Chinese leaders believed that China should not enter the war unless China was directly attacked . Lin Biao was Mao 's first choice to lead the Chinese People 's Volunteer Army ( PVA ) into Korea , but Lin refused , citing his bad health . 
 Mao then sought the support of Peng , who had not yet taken a strong position , to lead the PVA . Peng flew to Beijing from Xi 'an ( where he was still administering northwest China and directing the incorporation of Xinjiang into the PRC ) , and arrived on October 4 . Peng listened to both sides of the debate , and on October 5 decided to support Mao . Peng 's support for Mao 's position changed the atmosphere of the meeting , and most leaders changed their positions to support a direct Chinese intervention in the Korean War . On October 5 Peng was named the Commander and the Commissar of the People 's Volunteer Army and held both titles until the Korean Armistice Agreement in 1953 . Mao directed China 's general strategy , and Zhou was appointed general commander , coordinating Peng 's forces with the Soviet and North Korean governments , and the rest of the Chinese government . Over the next week , Peng established a headquarters in Shenyang , and prepared his invasion strategy with his officers . 
 After Zhou and Lin negotiated Stalin 's approval , Peng attended a conference in Beijing with Mao , Zhou , and Gao Gang on October 18 , and they ordered the first wave of Chinese soldiers — in total more than 260 @,@ 000 men — to cross into Korea on the night of October 19 . On October 25 the PVA had its first confrontation with UN troops at Onjong and Unsan , and pushed the UN forces south of the Chongchon River by November 4 in the aftermath of First Phase Campaign . From November 24 to December 24 , Peng directed 380 @,@ 000 PVA troops to confront UN forces in the Second Phase Campaign , and he successfully recovered the area north of the thirty @-@ eighth parallel . Despite his personal reservations , Peng then began an ambitious campaign to take the area south of the 38th parallel in order to fulfill Mao 's political objectives for the war . About 230 @,@ 000 Chinese soldiers crossed into South Korean territory on December 31 and captured Seoul as part of the Third Phase Campaign , but were forced to evacuate it with heavy losses on March 14 , 1951 as the UN forces counterattacked during the course of Fourth Phase Campaign . Peng launched a final Fifth Phase Campaign from April 22 – June 10 to retake Seoul with 548 @,@ 000 Chinese troops , but it failed , and the Korean War came to a standstill just above the 38th parallel . In the evaluation of Korean War historian Roy <unk> Appleman , Peng 's performances in the war were unremarkable in terms of military talents despite his aggressiveness and leadership skills . During the Cultural Revolution , Red Guards claimed that Peng 's successful campaigns , from October – December 1950 , were fought under Mao 's direction , but that his unsuccessful campaigns , from January – May 1951 , were organized by Peng against Mao 's instructions . Modern scholars reject this interpretation , and credit Peng with both the successes and failures of the war . 
 PVA casualties during the first 12 months of the Korean War , from October 1950 to October 1951 , were heavy . Soviet material support was slight ; and , because the only available means to transport supplies into Korea for the first year of the war was a force of 700 @,@ 000 labourers , all available supplies were light and limited . The UN forces also had complete air superiority . These logistic constraints later caused 45 @,@ 000 Chinese soldiers to freeze to death between November 27 and December 12 , 1950 , due to inadequate winter clothing . China 's insufficient artillery , armor , and air support meant that Peng was forced to rely heavily on human wave tactics until the summer of 1951 : stealthy fireteams attacked in column against weak points in enemy defenses , hoping that surprise , attrition and perseverance would break the enemy lines . Participants even drank large quantities of <unk> in order to improve their courage . Some of the worst Chinese battle losses occurred during the Second and the Fifth Phase Campaign : up to 40 percent of all Chinese forces in Korea were rendered combat ineffective between November 25 and December 24 , 1950 , and about 12 Chinese divisions were lost in during April 22 – June 10 , 1951 . All in all , over a million Chinese soldiers became casualties during the course of the war . Peng justified the PVA 's high casualty rate by his almost religious belief in the cause of Communism and the Communist Party , and his belief that the ends of the conflict justified the means . Some accounts even claimed that Peng invented the human wave tactic under the name " short attack " in order to exploit his manpower advantage . 
 In November 19 , 1951 , Zhou called a conference in Shenyang to discuss improvements to China 's logistical network , but these did little to directly resolve China 's supply problems . Peng visited Beijing several times over the next several months to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities . By the winter of 1951 – 52 , Peng became convinced that the war would be protracted , and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the foreseeable future . On February 24 , 1952 , the Central Military Commission , presided over by Zhou , discussed the PVA 's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort . After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war , Peng , in an angry outburst , shouted : " You have this and that problem ... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have ! Not to speak of the casualties ! For what are they giving their lives ? We have no aircraft . We have only a few guns . Transports are not protected . More and more soldiers are dying of starvation . Can 't you overcome some of your difficulties ? " The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference . Zhou subsequently called a series of meetings , where it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups , to be dispatched to Korea in shifts ; to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots ; to provide more anti @-@ aircraft guns to the front lines ; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union ; to provide the army with more food and clothing ; and , to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government . Peng also became a zealous supporter of the Three @-@ anti Campaign due to his belief that corruption and waste were the main causes of the PVA 's hardship . 
 Truce talks began on July 10 , 1951 , but proceeded slowly . Peng was recalled back to China in April 1952 due to a head tumor , and Chen Geng and Deng Hua later assumed Peng 's responsibilities in the PVA . On July 27 , 1953 , Peng personally signed the Armistice agreement in Panmunjom , ending the Korean War . At a mass rally in Pyongyang on July 31 , Kim Il Sung awarded Peng his second North Korean " National Flag " Order of Merit , First Class ( the first had been awarded to Peng in 1951 ) , and awarded Peng the title of " Hero of the Korean Democratic People 's Republic " . Peng also received a hero 's welcome in Tiananmen Square on August 11 . Chinese troops remained in North Korea until 1958 . 
 Peng 's experiences in the Korean War strongly affected his outlook over the next decade . The heavy losses sustained during the first year of the war convinced him that the Chinese army needed to change by introducing modern equipment and standards of professionalism , and by developing new tactics more suited to modern conventional warfare . He came to believe strongly that military training should never be reduced in favour of political indoctrination , and that military commanders should enjoy seniority over commissars . Because the only communist country fully prepared for modern technical warfare was the Soviet Union , Peng grew to see the Soviet Red Army as a model for the development of China 's PLA . These perspectives , and Peng 's long @-@ held conviction that the primary role of the Communist Party was to improve the welfare of the common people , were contrary to Mao 's political goals , contributing to their eventual conflict in the late 1950s . Stalin once arbitrated in favor of Peng in a conflict with a Russian diplomat , saying " Trust him in everything ; Peng is a long @-@ tested , talented militarist " .

 After being recalled back to China in April 1952 , Peng succeeded Zhou in managing the day @-@ to @-@ day affairs of the Central Military Commission in July 1952 ; and , in the spring of 1954 , Peng was confirmed as the vice @-@ chairman of the Commission ( Mao was its chairman ) , becoming effectively the most senior military leader in China . On September 24 , 1954 , the First National People 's Congress confirmed Peng 's position , and appointed him Defense Minister and one of the ten vice @-@ ministers of the State Council . Lin Biao was senior to Peng on the State Council . Soon after accepting these appointments , on October 1 , 1954 , Peng produced an ambitious plan for the modernization of the PLA on the model of the Soviet military . 
 = = = Political activities = = = 
 Peng had been an alternate member of the Central Committee since 1934 , a full member since 1938 , and a member of the Politburo since 1945 , but it was not until he became the leader of the PLA and moved permanently to Beijing , in November 1953 , that Peng was able to attend regular political meetings and became active in domestic politics . Peng had been loyal to Mao 's leadership since the 1935 Zunyi Conference , and continued to support Mao for several years after moving to Beijing . Peng ( like Lin Biao ) was implicated in passively supporting Gao Gang 's effort to replace Liu Shaoqi as the second most powerful person in China in 1953 , but then opposed Gao in 1954 , once Mao made his own opposition clear . Mao did not take any action against Peng ( or Lin ) , but Peng 's involvement alienated Peng from Liu and Liu 's supporters . In 1955 Peng supported Mao 's efforts to <unk> agriculture . Along with Liu Shaoqi , Zhu De , Lin Biao , Lin <unk> , and Luo <unk> , Peng opposed Mao 's attempt to liberalize China 's culture and politics in the first stages of the 1957 Hundred Flowers Campaign , but then supported Mao 's efforts to arrest and persecute Chinese citizens who had criticized the CCP later that year . 
 During the late 1950s , Peng developed a personal dislike for Mao 's efforts to promote his own image in Chinese popular culture as a perfect , infallible hero singularly responsible for the Communist victories of his time . In 1955 – 56 Peng was involved in a large number of efforts to moderate Mao 's popular image , developing into a personal campaign . Peng 's preference for modesty and simplicity led Peng to oppose Mao 's efforts to develop his personality cult . In 1955 a draft copy of a book , The Military History of the PVA , was submitted to Peng so that he could edit and authorize it . In the preface of the book it was stated that " the military victories of the PVA " were won " under the correct leadership of the CCP and of Comrade Mao Zedong " : Peng authorized the text after removing the phrase " and of Comrade Mao Zedong " . In 1956 an anonymous Chinese citizen wrote a letter to Peng condemning the practices of hanging portraits of Mao in public places and singing songs in praise of Mao : Peng sent this letter to Huang Kecheng , his chief of staff , to be widely distributed . Peng successfully opposed efforts to place a bronze statue of Mao in the Beijing Military Museum , saying : " why take the trouble to put it up ? What is put up now will be removed in the future . " When greeted by a group of soldiers who shouted " Long Live Chairman Mao ! " ( literally " 10 @,@ 000 years for Chairman Mao " ) , Peng addressed the soldiers , saying : " You shout ' 10 @,@ 000 years for Chairman Mao ! ' – does he , then , live for 10 @,@ 000 years ? He will not even live for 100 years ! This is a personality cult ! " When one of Peng 's political commissars suggested to him that the song The East is Red ( a song that idealizes Mao , which Mao later had sung in place of the Chinese national anthem during the Cultural Revolution ) be widely taught throughout the PLA , Peng angrily rejected the suggestion , saying " That is a personality cult ! That is idealism ! " Later in 1956 a group of soldiers visited Peng in order to request an audience with the Chairman , but Peng rejected them , saying : " He is an old man , what is so beautiful about him ? " 
 In preparation for the Eighth National Congress , held in September 1956 , Peng attended a Politburo committee to redraft the new Party Constitution . At this meeting , Peng suggested that a section in the Constitution 's preamble referring to Mao Zedong Thought be removed . Liu Shaoqi , Deng Xiaoping , Peng Zhen , and most other senior CCP members present quickly agreed , and it was removed from the final version of the 1956 Party Constitution . At the Congress , Peng was re @-@ appointed to the Politburo and as a full member of the Central Committee . 
 Peng resented Mao 's personal lifestyle , which Peng considered decadent and luxurious . By the late 1950s Mao had developed a lifestyle that was out of touch with Peng 's preference for modesty and simplicity . Mao enjoyed a private pool in Zhongnanhai , and had many villas around China built for him , which he would travel to on a private train . Mao enjoyed the companionship of an ever @-@ changing succession of enthusiastic young women whom he met either on weekly dances in Zhongnanhai or on his journeys by train . Mao had a costly office suite built for him in Beijing , including a private , book @-@ lined study . When Peng 's wife suggested the couple spend more free time visiting Mao 's quarters , Peng was reluctant , stating that Mao 's surroundings were " too luxuriously furnished " for him to tolerate . Throughout the 1950s , Peng continued to refer to the Chairman as " Old Mao " , an egalitarian title that was used among senior CCP leaders in the 1930s and 1940s . 
 = = = Military activities = = = 
 Peng staged his first offensive after becoming Defense Minister in January 1955 , when he attacked and occupied a chain of islands , part of Zhejiang , which were still held by the Kuomintang , from which the Nationalists occasionally staged guerrilla raids as far as Shanghai . This operation led the United States to form a defense agreement with Taiwan , effectively preventing the communists from completely defeating the Kuomintang . 
 Peng participated in a number of foreign trips throughout the communist world after becoming Defense Minister , the first time that he had traveled outside of China and North Korea . In May 1955 Peng visited East Germany , Poland , and the Soviet Union , meeting with Wilhelm Pieck , Józef Cyrankiewicz , Nikita <unk> , and the Soviet marshals Konstantin Rokossovsky and Georgy Zhukov . In September 1955 Peng traveled to Poland and the Soviet Union to attend the signing of the Warsaw Pact as an observer . In November 2 – December 3 , 1957 Peng accompanied Mao on his second visit to the Soviet Union . From April 24 – June 13 , 1959 Peng went on a " military goodwill tour " across the communist world , visiting Poland , East Germany , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Romania , Bulgaria , Albania , the Soviet Union , and Mongolia . 
 After Peng returned from his first tour abroad , in September 1955 , he began to seriously implement his " Four Great Systems " : the implementation of standardized military ranks , salaries , awards , and rules of conscription . On September 23 , 1955 the State Council named Peng one of the ten marshals of the PLA , China 's highest military rank . ( Before 1955 , Chinese soldiers were assigned " functions " instead of ranks , such as " company commander " , or " division commander " ) . PLA leaders were promoted into Peng 's newly founded system of military ranks , and were awarded newly created orders of merit . Peng himself was awarded the First Class Medal of the Order of August 1 ( for his achievements in the Chinese Civil war from 1927 – 1937 ) , the First Class Medal of the Order of Independence and Freedom ( for his achievements in the Sino @-@ Japanese War ) , and the First Class Medal of the Order of Liberation ( for his achievements in the Chinese Civil war from 1945 – 1949 ) . Peng introduced military insignia for the first time , and issued military uniforms modeled on those worn by Soviet soldiers . From January 1 , 1956 Peng replaced conscription with voluntary service , and standardized career soldiers ' salaries on eighteen grades , from private second class to marshal . In May 1956 Peng introduced a clear prioritization of rank favoring commanders over political commissars . By September 1956 Peng 's doctrines of professionalism , strict training , discipline , and the mastery of modern equipment were entrenched within the structure of the PLA . 
 Mao Zedong opposed all of these initiatives , but first focused his dissatisfaction on other marshals , Liu Bocheng and Luo <unk> , who Mao accused of " dogmatism " ( uncritically assimilating methods borrowed from the Soviet Union ) . In 1958 Mao convinced Peng of the need to maintain a balance between military professionalism and political indoctrination , and Peng cooperated in removing Liu and Luo from high positions . Peng 's removal of Liu especially cost Peng the support of many other military leaders , and Mao used Liu 's resulting criticism of Peng to criticize Peng before other senior Chinese leaders the next year , when Mao then sought to remove Peng . 
 Peng was still in command of China 's armed forces when Mao ordered the shelling of <unk> ( Quemoy ) and Matsu , islands off the coast of Fujian that were still held by the Kuomintang , in the late summer and autumn of 1958 . Peng developed a strategy with his Chief of Staff , Su Yu , to bombard the islands so intensely that the morale of their defenders would collapse , eventually leading to the islands ' surrender . After the islands ' surrender , the PLA would then use the islands to launch attacks against Taiwan . The saturated shelling of the islands included over half the artillery in China , and began on August 28 . The attack included a coordinated effort to cut off the islands ' air and sea supply lines . 
 The campaign ran into unexpected difficulties , and did not achieve its objectives . The Soviet Union did not give explicit support to the operation , and the United States provided air and sea cover to Kuomintang supply ships up to within three miles of the Chinese coast . Kuomintang fighter jets shot down thirty @-@ seven PRC fighters ( while only losing three themselves ) , and Nationalist artillery and naval bombardments destroyed fourteen PRC ships . Peng had quietly opposed the operation since its beginning , and began to gradually end hostilities after the PLA encountered serious difficulties , announcing a series of intermittent ceasefires before eventually halting the campaign in late October . Su Yu was blamed for the disaster and replaced with another ally of Peng 's , General Huang Kecheng . Peng 's position was not directly affected , but his personal prestige suffered , and the practical effects of his efforts to modernize China 's armed forces were called into question within the PLA . Su was accused of directing the aborted attack on <unk> and withdrawing troops from North Korea without authorization , and of secretly taking orders from the USSR . The conflict between Su and Peng lingered throughout Peng 's life , and Su was not rehabilitated until after his death .
