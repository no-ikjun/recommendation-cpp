 = Hurricane Hiki = 
 Hurricane Hiki was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the United States . It was also considered the first official hurricane in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands . The fourth tropical cyclone of the 1950 Pacific hurricane season , Hiki formed as a tropical depression to the southeast of Hawaii on August 12 . On the following day , the depression headed northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Hiki . While paralleling the Hawaiian Islands on August 16 , Hiki strengthened into a hurricane . Around that time , the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . The following day , Hiki curved southwestward on August 17 . Two days later , the hurricane resumed moving northwestward and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter . Around midday on August 21 , Hiki weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated about six hours later . 
 Although Hiki was a small tropical cyclone and bypassed Hawaii , heavy rainfall and strong winds were observed throughout the islands . At the <unk> Ranger Station on Kauai , 52 inches ( 1 @,@ 300 mm ) of precipitation was observed , which was the highest total associated with a tropical cyclone on record in the United States . The Waimea River overflowed , causing more than 200 residents to flee their homes . Many streets and several hundred acres of sugar cane fields were flooded . About $ 200 @,@ 000 ( 1950 USD ) in damage was reported due to flooding in the city of Waimea . In Kekaha , the powerhouse suffered severe damage . Throughout the islands , winds de @-@ roofed several homes and downed power lines ; one fatality occurred after a person came in contact with a live wire .

 According to ship reports during the summer , the Intertropical Convergence Zone was farther north than usual , which created favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis . Weather charts at the Honolulu International Airport , a tropical depression developed at 00 : 00 UTC on August 12 , while located about 760 miles ( 1 @,@ 220 km ) southeast of the Big Island . Thereafter , the storm gradually intensified , becoming a tropical storm at 06 : 00 UTC on August 13 . It was named Hiki , which is Hawaiian for Able . While situated east of Hilo , Hawaii , the system was described as an " immature storm " , and had a very small diameter . Shortly thereafter , a reconnaissance aircraft flew into Hiki and estimated that sustained wind speeds between 50 and 60 mph ( 80 and 100 km / h ) . Further intensification continued and the system strengthened into a hurricane on August 16 . Upon reaching hurricane intensity on August 16 , Hiki simultaneously attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Despite this , the storm had remained small , with gale force winds extending less than 150 mi ( 240 km ) from the center . Hiki remained between 100 and 200 mi ( 160 and 320 km ) offshore while paralleling several Hawaiian Islands , including Hawaii , Maui , Molokai , Oahu , and Kauai . 
 As a high pressure ridge intensified , the northwestward movement of Hiki was blocked , causing the storm to briefly turn due west on August 17 . The high pressure ridge eventually influenced the hurricane to re @-@ curve southwestward . On August 18 , a reconnaissance aircraft observed sustained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) to the south of the center ; a minimum barometric pressure of 982 mbar ( 29 @.@ 0 inHg ) was also observed . After the reconnaissance aircraft flight into the storm on August 18 , residents of Kauai and Oahu were alerted of a possible cyclonic loop . However , later that day , the high pressure ridge weakened , causing Hiki to turned westward and pass south of French Frigate Shoals and Midway Island . Late on August 19 , Hiki weakened to a tropical storm and then resumed its course to the northwest . By August 21 , Hiki further weakened to a tropical depression , and dissipated six hours later . 
 The hurricane was also followed by the Air Weather Service , located on Guam , who assigned the name Salome from the Pacific typhoon naming lists . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Hiki was one of the strongest tropical cyclones to approach the Hawaiian Islands in at least 45 years and officially the first hurricane in the region . As Hiki approached , a United States Coast Guard station with 14 people in French Frigate Shoals was alerted . In addition , ships in the area were also advised to take caution . Hiki caused high waves on some of the Hawaiian Islands . Hawaii remained on the southern semicircle of Hiki , and as a result , light wind damage occurred . The highest reported winds from Hiki was at the Kilauea Lighthouse on Kauai , where gusts up to 68 mph ( 109 km / h ) were observed . The islands of Niihau and Lanai also experienced tropical storm force winds , reaching 48 and 50 mph ( 77 and 80 km / h ) , respectively . As a result , several houses throughout the Hawaiian Islands lost their roof . In addition , a farmer in Kohala on Hawaii died after coming into contact with a live wire that was blown down from high winds . 
 Hiki was the wettest tropical cyclone in United States history , as rainfall of over 52 in ( 1 @,@ 300 mm ) observed at the <unk> Ranger Station on Kauai between August 14 and August 18 . The rain gauge was capable of holding 24 inches ( 610 mm ) of the rain and was emptied on August 15 . However , less than 24 hours later , the same rain gauge was overflowing . Heavy precipitation was also recorded on other locations on that island , including 13 inches ( 330 mm ) on Mount Waialeale . Few reports exist on rainfall totals on other Hawaiian Islands , with the only other island recording rainfall was Maui , with precipitation reaching 11 @.@ 9 inches ( 300 mm ) on August 15 . This was the highest 24 ‑ hour record for that island in the month of August . On Kauai , the Waimea River experienced one of the worst flood in its history , causing more than 200 residents in Waimea Valley to evacuate . The river also rose near the mouth of its tributary , the <unk> River , flooding the town of Waimea , causing about $ 200 @,@ 000 in damage . The streets on the island and hundreds of acres of sugar cane were flooded . Additionally , severe damage was reported at the Kekaha Powerhouse . 
 = Maitreyi = 
 Maitreyi ( " friendly one " ) was a Hindu philosopher who lived during the later Vedic period in ancient India . She is mentioned in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as one of two wives of the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya ; he is estimated to have lived around the 8th century BCE . In the Hindu epic Mahabharata and the <unk> , however , Maitreyi is described as an Advaita philosopher who never married . In ancient Sanskrit literature , she is known as a <unk> ( an expounder of the Veda ) . 
 Ten hymns in the Rigveda are attributed to Maitreyi , and she explored the Hindu concept of Atman ( soul or self ) in a dialogue with Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad . According to this dialogue , love is driven by a person 's soul , and Maitreyi discusses the nature of Atman and Brahman and their unity , the core of Advaita philosophy . This Maitreyi @-@ Yajnavalkya dialogue is the topic of <unk> 's <unk> , a commentary . 
 Maitreyi is cited as an example of the educational opportunities available to women in Vedic India , and their philosophical achievements . She is considered a symbol of Indian intellectual women , and an institution is named in her honour in New Delhi . 
 = = Early life = = 
 In the <unk> <unk> , the daughter of the sage Maitri is referred to as Sulabha Maitreyi and is mentioned in the <unk> with several other women scholars of the Vedic era . Her father , who lived in the <unk> capital of Mithila , was a minister in the court of King Janaka . 
 Although Maitreyi of ancient India , described as an Advaita philosopher , is said to be a wife of the sage Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad in the time of Janaka , the Hindu epic Mahabharata states Sulabha Maitreyi is a young beauty who never marries . In the latter , Maitreyi explains Advaita philosophy ( monism ) to Janaka and is described as a lifelong ascetic . She is called as a <unk> ( a female expounder of the Veda ) in ancient Sanskrit literature . Maitreyi and Yajnavalkya are estimated to have lived around the 8th century BCE . 
 In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad , Maitreyi is described as Yajnavalkya 's scholarly wife ; his other wife , Katyayani , was a housewife . While Yajnavalkya and Katyayani lived in contented domesticity , Maitreyi studied metaphysics and engaged in theological dialogues with her husband in addition to " making self @-@ inquiries of introspection " . 
 = = Maitreyi @-@ Yajnavalkya dialogue = = 
 In the Rigveda about ten hymns are attributed to Maitreyi . She explores the Hindu concept of Atman ( soul or self ) in a dialogue contained in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad . The dialogue , also called the Maitreyi @-@ Yajnavalkya dialogue , states that love is driven by a person 's soul , and it discusses the nature of Atman and Brahman and their unity , the core of Advaita philosophy . 
 This dialogue appears in several Hindu texts ; the earliest is in chapter 2 @.@ 4 – and modified in chapter 4 @.@ 5 – of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad , one of the principal and oldest Upanishads , dating from approximately 700 BCE . The Maitreyi @-@ Yajnavalkya dialogue has survived in two manuscript recensions from the <unk> and <unk> Vedic schools ; although they have significant literary differences , they share the same philosophical theme . 
 After Yajnavalkya achieved success in the first three stages of his life – brahmacharya ( as a student ) , <unk> ( with his family ) and <unk> ( in retirement ) – he wished to become a sannyasi ( a <unk> ) in his old age . He asked Maitreyi for permission , telling her that he wanted to divide his assets between her and Katyayani . Maitreyi said that she was not interested in wealth , since it would not make her " immortal " , but wanted to learn about immortality : 
 In the dialogue which follows , Yajnavalkya explains his views on immortality in Atman ( soul ) , Brahman ( ultimate reality ) and their equivalence . Maitreyi objects to parts of Yajnavalkya 's explanation , and requests clarification . 
 Scholars have differing views on whether this dialogue is evidence that in ancient Vedic tradition women were accepted as active participants in spiritual discussions and as scholars of Brahman . Wendy Doniger , an American Indologist and a professor of History of Religions , states that in this dialogue Maitreyi is not portrayed as an author , but is part of an Upanishadic story of a Brahmin with two wives who are distinguished by their intellect . Karen <unk> , another American Indologist and a professor of Comparative Religion , in contrast , states that Maitreyi is portrayed as theologically minded , as she challenges Yajnavalkya in this dialogue and asks the right questions . 
 First @-@ millennium Indian scholars , such as <unk> ( <unk> , c . 750 CE ) , have viewed this male @-@ female dialogue as profound on both sides ; Maitreyi refuses wealth , wishing to share her husband 's spiritual knowledge , and in the four known versions of the Upanishadic story she challenges Yajnavalkya 's theory of Atman . Yajnavalkya acknowledges her motivations , and that her questions are evidence she is a seeker of ultimate knowledge and a lover of the Atman . 
 The Maitreyi dialogue in the Upanishad is significant beyond being a gage of gender relations . Adi Shankara , a scholar of the influential Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy , wrote in his <unk> <unk> that the purpose of the Maitreyi @-@ Yajnavalkya dialogue in chapter 2 @.@ 4 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is to highlight the importance of the knowledge of Atman and Brahman , and to understand their oneness . According to Shankara , the dialogue suggests renunciation is prescribed in the Sruti ( vedic texts of Hinduism ) , as a means to knowledge of the Brahman and Atman . He adds , that the pursuit of self @-@ knowledge is considered important in the Sruti because the Maitreyi dialogue is repeated in chapter 4 @.@ 5 as a " logical finale " to the discussion of Brahman in the Upanishad . 
 = = = Nature of love = = = 
 The Maitreyi @-@ Yajnavalkya dialogue includes a discussion of love and the essence of whom one loves , suggesting that love is a connection of the soul and the universal self ( related to an individual ) : 
 According to theological author and editor Robert Van De Weyer , this asserts that all love is a reflection of one 's own soul : parents ' love of their children , a love of religion or of the entire world . German Indologist and Oxford University professor Max Müller says that the love described in the Maitreyi @-@ Yajnavalkya dialogue of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad extends to all aspects of one 's life and beyond ; in verse 2 @.@ 4 @.@ 5 , " The Devas ( gods ) are not dear to one out of love for gods , but because one may love the Self ( Atman ) that the gods are dear " . In the dialogue " the Brahman @-@ class , the <unk> @-@ class , these worlds , these gods , these beings , everything that is what this Soul is " , and when " we see , hear , perceive and know the Self , then all is known " . 
 Concluding his dialogue on the " inner self " , or soul , <unk> tells Maitreyi : 
 After Yajnavalkya leaves and becomes a sannyasi , Maitreyi becomes a <unk> – she too wanders and leads a renunciate 's life .

 Maitreyi , who is also mentioned in a number of Puranas , " is regarded as one of the most learned and virtuous women of ancient India " and symbolizes intellectual women in India . A college in New Delhi is named after her , as is the <unk> Vedic Village , a retreat location in Tamil Nadu . 
 = Pilot ( 30 Rock ) = 
 The pilot episode of the American situation comedy series 30 Rock premiered on October 10 , 2006 on the CTV Television Network in Canada , and October 11 , 2006 on NBC in the United States . The episode was directed by Adam Bernstein and written by Tina Fey , the series ' creator , executive producer , and lead actor . 
 In 2002 , Tina Fey , then head writer of Saturday Night Live ( SNL ) , pitched the idea for a series about a cable news network to NBC , who rejected it . Two years later , Fey approached NBC with a similar idea : a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes look at The Girlie Show , a television show similar to SNL . NBC approved the series in May 2006 and production began shortly after . Although the episode received generally positive reviews , it finished third in its timeslot among all viewers and among adults aged 18 to 49 . Critics praised the performances of Jack McBrayer and Jane Krakowski , who played Kenneth Parcell and Jenna Maroney , respectively . 
 Several characters are introduced in the pilot : Liz Lemon ( Fey ) , the head writer of a sketch comedy series called The Girlie Show ; Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) , the network executive ; Kenneth Parcell ( McBrayer ) , the NBC page ; and the writing staff and cast of Lemon 's show . This episode focuses on Jack 's attempt to convince Liz to hire film star Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) as part of the cast of The Girlie Show and the crew 's reactions to Tracy 's addition . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The show begins with Liz Lemon , the head writer of the television series The Girlie Show , attempting to buy a hot dog before work . After a fellow commuter tries to jump the queue , Liz buys $ 150 worth of hot dogs and distributes them to random passersby , hobos , and colleagues . When she arrives at work , she is embarrassed when she is forced by Kenneth , the <unk> NBC Page who conducts tours around 30 Rock , to introduce herself to a group of Girlie Show fans . 
 Liz and her producer Pete Hornberger ( Scott Adsit ) meet with The Girlie Show 's new network executive Jack Donaghy . Jack tells Liz and Pete that he has been sent to 30 Rock to re @-@ tool The Girlie Show . After he inadvertently insults her , Liz takes an initial dislike to Jack . Jack asks Liz to hire Tracy Jordan , star of the film Honky Grandma Be Trippin ' , as part of the cast . Liz is skeptical as Tracy has a history of problematic behaviour , including running down Interstate 405 in his underwear while shouting " I am a Jedi ! " and falling asleep on his neighbor 's roof . In comparison to Liz , Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) , the narcissistic star of The Girlie Show , takes to Jack upon their first meeting . She begins to worry when she hears that Tracy may become the new star of the show . 
 Against her own judgment , Liz meets Tracy at a restaurant , but when Tracy discovers that he does not like the food they go to another restaurant . While Liz tried to convince Tracy not to join The Girlie Show , he discusses conspiracy theories . After the meeting , Tracy offers to take Liz back to the studio , but he makes a detour to a strip club in the Bronx . While trying to get home , Liz learns that Jack fired Pete earlier that day . Tracy and Liz arrive at the studio halfway through the live broadcast of the show . Liz sends Tracy out on stage to talk off the last bit of the show , much to The Girlie Show studio audience 's delight and Jenna 's shock . Backstage , Liz forces Jack to rehire Pete and to promise to guarantee Jenna 's job security .

 Tina Fey , the head writer and a performer on NBC 's Saturday Night Live , pitched a pilot episode for a situation comedy about a cable news network to NBC in 2002 . NBC Entertainment president Kevin Reilly , felt that " Fey was using the news setting as a fig leaf for her own experience and [ he ] encouraged her to write what she knew . " The pilot , and subsequent series , was reworked to revolve around an SNL style series . Fey signed a contract with NBC in May 2003 , which allowed her to remain in her SNL head writer position until at least the 2004 – 2005 television season . As part of the contract , Fey was required to develop a primetime project to be produced by Broadway Video , Lorne Michaels ' production company , and NBC Universal . During the 2004 – 2005 pilot season , Fey began developing a pilot project under the working title Untitled Tina Fey Project . The pilot , which became 30 Rock , centered on the head writer of a variety show and how she managed her relationships with the show 's volatile star and executive producer . During development , some characters were altered ; a second star of the variety show was added and the executive producer role changed to network executive . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Fey worked with Jennifer McNamara and Adam Bernstein for the casting of the series . Their first decision was for Fey to portray the lead character , Liz Lemon . Fey acknowledged similarities between Liz and her own life when she became head writer on SNL , primarily a heavy focus on her job . Fey asked one of her castmates on SNL , Tracy Morgan , to play Tracy Jordan . Morgan believed the role was " right up [ his ] alley and it was tailor made for [ him ] " , and Fey noted that Tracy Jordan " acts wild " like Tracy Morgan did at SNL . 
 Fey wrote the character of <unk> NBC page Kenneth Parcell with her friend Jack McBrayer , who has been described as " the show 's brightest discovery " , in mind . She has said that she " really wanted him for that part and was very happy when no one objected " . Shortly after McBrayer 's casting , Alec Baldwin was cast as Jack Donaghy , the " totally uncensored " Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming . Fey had written the part with Baldwin in mind , but was " very pleasantly surprised when he agreed to do it " . As the series progressed " the push @-@ pull [ relationship ] between Fey 's character , Liz Lemon , the harried head writer of The Girlie Show , and Alec Baldwin 's domineering network executive , Jack Donaghy " helped the show find " its rhythm " . 
 Judah Friedlander was cast as the staff writer of The Girlie Show , Frank Rossitano . Before auditioning for the role , Friedlander and Fey had never met . His character was based on at least two writers that Fey used to work with at SNL , but he " certainly brought some of [ his ] own things to it as well " , including his trucker hat wearing persona . Fey based the role of Pete Hornberger , a long time friend of Liz 's and producer of The Girlie Show , on Scott Adsit , who agreed to portray the character . 
 In an unaired pilot for 30 Rock , Rachel Dratch , a former SNL cast member , originally played the role of Jenna DeCarlo . In August 2006 , executive producer Lorne Michaels announced that Dratch would be replaced as Jenna but would portray different roles in other episodes . In the re @-@ tooled pilot , Dratch appears as The Girlie Show 's cat wrangler . Later in the month , NBC announced that Jane Krakowski had replaced Dratch in the role of Jenna , and that the character was renamed Jenna Maroney . Michaels said that " everyone is thrilled that she is joining the cast " , and thought she was going to be a " perfect fit " .

Metacritic gave the episode a Metascore – a weighted average based on the impressions of a select thirty @-@ one critical reviews – of 67 out of 100 . Tom Gliatto of People Weekly and Anna Johns of AOL 's TV Squad declared 30 Rock the best new comedy of the season . Johns described Tracy Jordan 's line " I 'm from the government and I 'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets " as " <unk> funny " , and praised Jane Krakowski 's replacement of Rachel Dratch in the Jenna role . Keith Watson of Metro said that " It may just be a Mary Tyler Moore Show for the [ 21st century ] but 30 Rock , er , rocks " . Watson rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars . Dorothy Rabinowitz of The Wall Street Journal praised the " hilarious scenes and fine ensemble cast " , particularly commenting on Jack McBrayer 's performance as Kenneth Parcell and Rachel Dratch 's portrayal of the cat @-@ wrangler , Greta Johansen . 
 Not all critics liked the episode . Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV felt that this episode did not live up to the show 's potential . San Francisco Chronicle 's Tim Goodman lamented that " the original [ episode ] was funnier " than the one that aired . Tom Shales of Washington Post said that " the show needs a better premise and funnier dialogue " . Despite this , Shales said that 30 Rock " is not a self @-@ important bore like Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip " , and praised Tracy Morgan 's performance as Tracy Jordan . The New York Times ' Alessandra Stanley praised Alec Baldwin 's " slyly absurd comic presence that is bigger and brighter than any joke or character actor on the show " , but mentioned that " Nothing very funny happens on 30 Rock until Alec Baldwin enters the room , and suddenly this new NBC sitcom comes alive " . Fey herself felt the episode did not introduce the show well , calling it " awkward , sweaty ... I never want to watch that mess again " in her memoir Bossypants .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and as of 2014 , broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1898 race " easily " , with Cambridge leading overall with 32 victories to Cambridge 's 22 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Oxford 's coaches were G. C. Bourne who had rowed for Oxford in the 1882 and 1883 races , Douglas McLean ( an Oxford Blue five times between 1883 and 1887 ) and R. P. Rowe ( who rowed for Oxford four times between 1889 and 1892 ) . Cambridge were coached by William Fletcher , Oxford Blue and R. C. Lehmann , the former president of the Cambridge Union Society and captain of the 1st Trinity Boat Club ( although he had rowed in the trials eights for Cambridge , he was never selected for the Blue boat ) . The umpire for the race for the tenth year in a row was Frank Willan who won the event four consecutive times , rowing for Oxford in the 1866 , 1867 , 1868 and 1869 races . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 5 lb ( 78 @.@ 3 kg ) , 0 @.@ 5 pounds ( 0 @.@ 23 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Cambridge saw three rowers with Boat Race experience return , in Claude Goldie , former Boat Club president William Dudley Ward and Raymond Broadly Etherington @-@ Smith . Oxford 's crew contained four former Blues , including Harcourt Gilbey Gold who was rowing at stroke for the fourth consecutive year . All but one of the Oxford crew were educated at Eton College ; Cambridge 's crew contained five Old Etonians . Australian rower Noel Leonard Coward was the only participant in the race registered as non @-@ British . C. E.

 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . The weather on the day of the race was good , but the tide was poor . Willan got the race underway at 12 : 58 p.m. and the crews remained reasonably level until the Mile Post , where Oxford held a quarter of a length lead . Cambridge began to reduce the deficit , so Oxford stroke Gold increased the rate in an attempt to make the most of the favourable bend in the river . The spurt had little effect , and the Light Blue stroke John Houghton Gibbon responded in kind with a burst of his own . 
 The Cambridge boat drew away quickly and were well ahead by The Doves pub , allowing them " to take matters fairly easily over the latter part of the course " . Cambridge won by three and a quarter lengths in a time of 21 minutes and 4 seconds . It was their first victory in ten years and took the overall record to 32 – 23 in Oxford 's favour . Author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater remarked that " Cambridge were definitely the better crew " and noted that their effort was all the more impressive as number four John Ernest Payne had been struck down by influenza just a day before the race .

Both of his parents were descended from Three Bars , who was the sire of Lena 's Bar and the grandsire of Jet Deck 's dam . Easy Jet is one of only two horses in the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame to have both parents in the Hall of Fame ; his two grandsires , Moon Deck and Three Bars , are also in the Hall of Fame . 
 Easy Jet was of sorrel color , a light yellowish @-@ red . When fully grown , he stood about 15 @.@ 3 hands high ( 63 inches ; 160 cm ) and weighed about 1 @,@ 300 pounds ( 590 kg ) . He had a large star and a stripe on his face . 
 Of Easy Jet 's stamina and busy training regimen , Merrick said , " I guess he ate at night ; I don 't know when else . It was unbelievable the amount of energy he had " . Training for the race track generally begins when a horse is a long yearling — between one and a half and two years of age . Easy Jet was so easy to train that Merrick decided to oversee the training himself rather than send the horse away to a professional trainer . In a practice race at the ranch , Merrick matched the yearling against Jet Smooth . Although his elder brother had the advantage of previous race experience , Easy Jet won the 350 @-@ yard ( 320 m ) race . Easy Jet 's performance prompted Merrick to enter him in a yearling race at Blue Ribbon Downs , which the colt won by more than a length . 
 = = Racing career = = 
 Easy Jet raced for two years , starting 38 races . He won 27 of his races , came in second seven times and third twice , and placed below third only twice , with race earnings totaling $ 445 @,@ 721 ( approximately $ 2 @,@ 716 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) . He earned an AQHA Superior Race Horse award along with his Race Register of Merit . A Superior Race horse must have earned at least 200 AQHA racing points by winning races , and even more in stakes races . A Race Register of Merit is the lowest level of racing award earned from the AQHA , and is gained when a horse attains a speed rating of 80 in a race , whether or not it wins the race . His best speed rating was AAAT , which was the highest grade awarded at the time he was racing . Over his two @-@ year career , he won 12 stakes races , and placed second in four and third in one . 
 In 1969 , his first official year on the track , he won the All American Futurity and eight other stakes races . In winning the All American , he led from the start on a sloppy , muddy track . His jockey , Willie Lovell , explained that he needed to do very little to win : " In the stretch , when I saw Easy Jet had it , I let him run his own race . All I had to do was just sit there and let him roll . " His time of 20 @.@ 46 seconds to cover 400 yards ( 370 m ) was remarkable considering that three days of rain before the start of the race had turned the track into a muddy quagmire . At another stakes , the Ribbon Futurity at Sallisaw , Oklahoma , Easy Jet won by three @-@ quarters of a length and set a new track record of 16 @.@ 92 seconds for 330 yards ( 300 m ) . The only time in 1969 he did not finish first , second , or third , he had issues in the starting gate , false @-@ started , broke some teeth loose against the front of the gate , and was struggling to stand up again when the gates opened ; he still managed to finish fifth out of ten horses . 
 At the end of the 1969 racing season , he was named World Champion Quarter Running Horse , Champion Quarter Running Stallion , and Champion Quarter Running Two @-@ Year Old Colt by the AQHA . He was also the highest money @-@ earning horse and only the fourth two @-@ year @-@ old to be named World Champion . During his first year of racing , he started 26 times , won 22 and placed ( came in second ) in another three . Most two @-@ year @-@ old Quarter Horses race on average under five times in their first year of racing , and the average for all ages is just over five starts per year . Many people criticized Merrick for starting Easy Jet so often . Merrick said , however , " You had to run him about once every ten days or he 'd have got so high you couldn 't hardly stand to be around him . As long as we were going to run him , we figured we might as well make it count for something . " Despite all of the starts , Easy Jet had enough energy to be difficult to handle ; in this respect , he was considered high @-@ spirited rather than mean . 
 In 1970 , he started 12 times , and won five times , placed second four times , and earned third place twice . His only unplaced finish was in the Rainbow Derby finals , where he came in dead last . Before he started racing that year , he stood at stud to a full book of mares , breeding as many mares as his owners would allow , which limited his racing time . During the Rocky Mountain Quarter Horse Derby at Centennial Park in Denver , Colorado , on October 4 , 1970 , which Easy Jet won without ever relinquishing the lead , the stallion became the highest @-@ earning Quarter Horse racer of all time , with earnings of more than $ 440 @,@ 000 ( $ 2 @,@ 681 @,@ 097 as of 2016 ) . At the end of the year , he was named Champion Quarter Running Stallion and Champion Quarter Running Three @-@ Year Old Colt . 
 = = Retirement and career at stud = = 
 Before his retirement from racing in 1970 , Easy Jet had already started standing at stud , returning to the track only after the breeding season . In 1971 , his first foals arrived . His offspring began racing in 1973 and soon put Easy Jet on the AQHA Leading Sires of Race Winners list . With their success , his stud fee , or the cost of breeding a mare to him , rose from $ 2 @,@ 000 ( approximately $ 11 @,@ 700 as of 2016 ) in 1971 to $ 5 @,@ 000 ( $ 26 @,@ 653 as of 2016 ) in 1973 ; by 1980 , it was $ 30 @,@ 000 ( approximately $ 86 @,@ 200 as of 2016 ) . 
 In 1971 , Merrick sold a half @-@ interest in Easy Jet and his full brother Jet Smooth to Joe McDermott , and five years later , in 1976 , the partners sold Easy Jet to the Buena Suerte Ranch for $ 3 @.@ 57 million ( approximately $ 14 @,@ 845 @,@ 800 as of 2016 ) . Later , after two of the partners in the ranch died unexpectedly , Merrick re @-@ purchased Easy Jet and bought a controlling share in the ranch . In 1980 , the stallion was syndicated for $ 30 million ( approximately $ 86 @,@ 159 @,@ 100 as of 2016 ) , a record amount at the time . The syndicate had 50 shares , each costing $ 600 @,@ 000 ( approximately $ 1 @,@ 723 @,@ 200 as of 2016 ) . The oil bust of the 1980s , and changes in US tax laws affecting horse operations , led to financial problems for the horse market in general and the syndicate , which led to financial difficulties for Merrick and resulted in many changes of ownership for Easy Jet until the death of the champion in 1992 . 
 After retiring to stud full @-@ time , he had a very successful career . He became the first All American Futurity winner to sire another winner when his daughter Easy Date won the All American Futurity in 1974 . Easy Date was later named 1975 World Champion Quarter Running Horse . He also sired Pie In the Sky , the 1979 All American Futurity winner , and Mr <unk> Jet , the 1985 All American Futurity winner . More than 1 @,@ 500 of his offspring earned their AQHA Race Register of Merit , and nine became World Champion Quarter Running Horses . Besides the horses already mentioned , the champions include My Easy Credit , Extra Easy , Easily Smashed , Easy Angel , Easy Move , and <unk> . His foal Sunset Gallant Jet was the 1979 and 1980 AQHA High Point Cutting & Chariot Racing Co @-@ Champion . At various points in time , Easy Jet has led the AQHA 's lists of All @-@ time leading sires of sires , All @-@ time leading sires of Register of Merit qualifiers , All @-@ time leading sires of stakes winners , and All @-@ time leading broodmare sires . In March 2008 , he still led the list of All @-@ time leading sires of Quarter Horse racehorses by winners , and on the corresponding list ordered by earnings , he ranks fourth . As a broodmare sire , or maternal grandsire , of racehorses , Easy Jet led the All @-@ time leading lists by winners in March 2008 , and the same list ordered by earnings had him second . As of 2008 , his offspring had earned over $ 26 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 on the racetrack . In total , he sired 2 @,@ 507 foals in 25 years of breeding . 
 Easy Jet was euthanized in 1992 due to laminitis , a disease of the hoof . He was buried in his paddock on Walter Merrick 's 14 Ranch near Sayre , Oklahoma . Merrick was unable to bring himself to see the horse before he was put down . He said , " I couldn 't go , I just couldn 't see him like that . He was too good a friend " . Easy Jet was inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame in 1993 .

 = Charles Frederick Horn = 
 Charles Frederick Horn ( 24 February 1762 – 3 August 1830 ) was an English musician and composer . Born in Germany , he emigrated to London with few possessions and no knowledge of the English language , yet rose to become a music teacher in the Royal Household . As an editor and arranger , he helped introduce the music of Johann Sebastian Bach to England . 
 = = Life = = 
 Born in Nordhausen , Germany to John Wolfgang Horn and Sophia Dorothea <unk> , Charles Frederick Horn was the third of their four children . According to the memoirs of Charles Frederick 's son , Charles Edward Horn , John Wolfgang wished for his son to become a surveyor . Horn would often furtively practice music instead ; when his father found out , he destroyed the family 's clavichord in the hopes of preventing his son from becoming distracted from his studies . This , though , did not dissuade Horn from taking music lessons from Nordhausen organist Christoph Gottlieb Schröter . 
 On Schröter 's death in 1782 , Horn decided to move to Paris to try a living as a musician . He left his home with little money and a suitcase of clothes . En route to Paris , he encountered a stranger in Hamburg by the name of Winkelman , who persuaded the impressionable Horn that London would better serve the aspirations of a young German musician than France . Winkelman accompanied him to London , but upon arriving , stole almost all of Horn 's money and disappeared . Destitute and knowing no English , he wandered the streets of London before encountering a German @-@ speaking Irishman , who sympathised with his plight . The man took Horn to the piano shop of Longman and Broderip at Cheapside , where Horn played the piano for its co @-@ proprietor , Francis Fane Broderip . Impressed , Broderip introduced Horn to the Saxon ambassador John Maurice de <unk> de Brühl recommended Horn to Granville Leveson @-@ Gower , 1st Marquess of Stafford , who hired him as his daughters ' music teacher . 
 The appointment meant that Trentham Hall , Leveson @-@ Gower 's estate in Staffordshire , became Horn 's new residence . There , he met and fell in love with Diana Dupont , the French tutor of Leveson @-@ Gower 's daughters . The two married on 28 September 1785 , and subsequently moved to London , where Dupont gave birth to the couple 's first child , Charles Edward Horn , on 21 June 1786 . Horn published his first composition , Six Sonatas for the Piano , Violin , and Violoncello ( Op. 1 ) , earlier that year in May . Subscribers to the work included such luminaries as Muzio Clementi , Johann Peter Salomon , George IV ( then the Prince of Wales ) , and Lady Caroline Waldegrave . The latter introduced Horn to Queen Charlotte , who appointed him as her personal music tutor ; he instructed the Queen twice a week from 20 October 1789 to 9 October 1793 . While in her service , he maintained two homes , one in London and the other in Windsor . He was also engaged from June 1789 to October 1812 to teach music to the royal princesses . During his employment in the royal household , he composed a set of three Sonatas ( Op. 2 ) , which he dedicated to the Queen . 
 Horn continued composing numerous pieces , but he is perhaps best known for his work in arranging and editing music — in particular , the works of Bach . In 1807 , he published an arrangement for two violins , viola , and cello / piano for 12 of Bach 's organ fugues . The next year , he met Samuel Wesley , with whom he would collaborate in editing , arranging , and publishing the first ever complete edition of Bach 's six organ trios ( 1809 ) and the first English edition of the Well @-@ Tempered Clavier ( 1810 ) . Horn , whom Wesley described as " indefatigable " , had plans to publish all of Bach 's works , but this never came to fruition . 
 In June 1824 , King George IV appointed Horn as organist of St George 's Chapel at Windsor Castle . He stepped down after King George 's death on 26 June 1830 , and died shortly after in Windsor . He was buried at St George 's Chapel . Horn was survived by his wife , with whom he had seven children .

 = Himeji Castle = 
 Himeji Castle ( <unk> , Himeji @-@ jō ) is a hilltop Japanese castle complex located in Himeji , in Hyōgo Prefecture , Japan . The castle is regarded as the finest surviving example of prototypical Japanese castle architecture , comprising a network of 83 buildings with advanced defensive systems from the feudal period . The castle is frequently known as <unk> @-@ jō or <unk> @-@ jō ( " White Egret Castle " or " White Heron Castle " ) because of its brilliant white exterior and supposed resemblance to a bird taking flight . 
 Himeji Castle dates to 1333 , when Akamatsu <unk> built a fort on top of Himeyama hill . The fort was dismantled and rebuilt as Himeyama Castle in 1346 , and then remodeled into Himeji Castle two centuries later . Himeji Castle was then significantly remodeled in 1581 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi , who added a three @-@ story castle keep . In 1600 , Tokugawa Ieyasu awarded the castle to Ikeda Terumasa for his help in the Battle of Sekigahara , and Ikeda completely rebuilt the castle from 1601 to 1609 , expanding it into a large castle complex . Several buildings were later added to the castle complex by Honda Tadamasa from 1617 to 1618 . For over 400 years , Himeji Castle has remained intact , even throughout the extensive bombing of Himeji in World War II , and natural disasters such as the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake . 
 Himeji Castle is the largest and most visited castle in Japan , and it was registered in 1993 as one of the first UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country . The area within the middle moat of the castle complex is a designated Special Historic Site and five structures of the castle are also designated National Treasures . Along with Matsumoto Castle and Kumamoto Castle , Himeji Castle is considered one of Japan 's three premier castles . In order to preserve the castle buildings , it underwent restoration work for several years and reopened to the public on March 27 , 2015 . The works also removed decades of dirt and grime , restoring the formerly gray roof to its original brilliant white color . 
 = = History = = 
 Himeji Castle 's construction dates to 1333 , when a fort was constructed on Himeyama hill by Akamatsu <unk> , the ruler of the ancient Harima Province . In 1346 , his son <unk> demolished this fort and built Himeyama Castle in its place . In 1545 , the Kuroda clan was stationed here by order of the <unk> clan , and feudal ruler Kuroda <unk> remodeled the castle into Himeji Castle , completing the work in 1561 . In 1580 , Kuroda Yoshitaka presented the castle to Toyotomi Hideyoshi , and in 1581 Hideyoshi significantly remodeled the castle , building a three @-@ story keep with an area of about 55 m2 ( 590 sq ft ) . 
 Following the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 , Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Himeji Castle to his son @-@ in @-@ law , Ikeda Terumasa , as a reward for his help in battle . Ikeda demolished the three @-@ story keep that had been created by Hideyoshi , and completely rebuilt and expanded the castle from 1601 to 1609 , adding three moats and transforming it into the castle complex that is seen today . The expenditure of labor involved in this expansion is believed to have totaled 25 million man @-@ days . Ikeda died in 1613 , passing the castle to his son , who also died three years later . In 1617 , Honda Tadamasa and his family inherited the castle , and Honda added several buildings to the castle complex , including a special tower for his daughter @-@ in @-@ law , Princess Sen ( <unk> , <unk> ) . 
 In the Meiji Period ( 1868 to 1912 ) , many Japanese castles were destroyed . Himeji Castle was abandoned in 1871 and some of the castle corridors and gates were destroyed to make room for Japanese army barracks . The entirety of the castle complex was slated to be demolished by government policy , but it was spared by the efforts of Nakamura Shigeto , an army colonel . A stone monument honoring Nakamura was placed in the castle complex within the first gate , the <unk> Gate ( <unk> , <unk> ) . Although Himeji Castle was spared , Japanese castles had become obsolete and their preservation was costly . 
 When the han feudal system was abolished in 1871 , Himeji Castle was put up for auction . The castle was purchased by a Himeji resident for 23 Japanese yen ( about 200 @,@ 000 yen or US $ 2 @,@ 258 today ) . The buyer wanted to demolish the castle complex and develop the land , but the cost of destroying the castle was estimated to be too great , and it was again spared . 
 Himeji was heavily bombed in 1945 , at the end of World War II , and although most of the surrounding area was burned to the ground , the castle survived intact . One firebomb was dropped on the top floor of the castle but failed to explode . In order to preserve the castle complex , substantial repair work was undertaken starting in 1956 , with a labor expenditure of 250 @,@ 000 man @-@ days and a cost of 550 million yen . In January 1995 , the city of Himeji was substantially damaged by the Great Hanshin earthquake , but Himeji Castle again survived virtually undamaged , demonstrating remarkable earthquake resistance . Even the bottle of sake placed on the altar at the top floor of the keep remained in place .

 Himeji Castle is the largest castle in Japan . It serves as an excellent example of prototypical Japanese castle architecture , containing many of the defensive and architectural features associated with Japanese castles . The curved walls of Himeji Castle are sometimes said to resemble giant fans ( <unk> , sensu ) , but the principal materials used in the structures are stone and wood . Feudal family crests ( <unk> , <unk> ) are installed throughout the architecture of the building , signifying the various lords that inhabited the castle throughout its history . 
 The Himeji Castle complex is located in the center of Himeji , Hyōgo on top of a hill called Himeyama , which is 45 @.@ 6 m ( 150 ft ) above sea level . The castle complex comprises a network of 83 buildings such as storehouses , gates , corridors , and turrets ( <unk> , <unk> ) . Of these 83 buildings , 74 are designated as Important Cultural Assets : 11 corridors , 16 turrets , 15 gates , and 32 earthen walls . The highest walls in the castle complex have a height of 26 m ( 85 ft ) . Joining the castle complex is Koko @-@ en Garden ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a Japanese garden created in 1992 to commemorate Himeji city 's 100th anniversary . 
 From east to west , the Himeji Castle complex has a length of 950 to 1 @,@ 600 m ( 3 @,@ 120 to 5 @,@ 250 ft ) , and from north to south , it has a length of 900 to 1 @,@ 700 m ( 3 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 600 ft ) . The castle complex has a circumference of 4 @,@ 200 m ( 2 @.@ 6 mi ) . It covers an area of 233 hectares ( 2 @,@ 330 @,@ 000 m2 or 576 acres ) , making it roughly 50 times as large as the Tokyo Dome or 60 times as large as Koshien Stadium . 
 Main Keep ( 大天守 , daitenshu ) at the center of the complex is 46 @.@ 4 m ( 152 ft ) high , standing 92 m ( 302 ft ) above sea level . Together with Main Keep , three smaller subsidiary keeps ( <unk> , kotenshu ) form a cluster of towers . Externally , the keep appears to have five floors , because the second and third floors from the top appear to be a single floor ; however , it actually has six floors and a basement . The basement of Main Keep has an area of 385 m2 ( 4 @,@ 140 sq ft ) , and its interior contains special facilities that are not seen in other castles , including lavatories , a drain board , and a kitchen corridor . 
 Main Keep has two pillars , with one standing in the east and one standing in the west . The east pillar , which has a base diameter of 97 cm ( 38 in ) , was originally a single fir tree , but it has since been mostly original . The base of the west pillar is 85 by 95 cm ( 33 by 37 in ) , and it is made of Japanese cypress . During the Shōwa Restoration ( 1956 – 1964 ) a Japanese cypress tree with a length of 26 @.@ 4 m ( 87 ft ) was brought down from the Kiso Mountains and replaced the old pillar . The tree was broken in this process , so another tree was brought down from Mount <unk> , and the two trees were joined on the third floor . 
 The first floor of Main Keep has an area of 554 m2 ( 5 @,@ 960 sq ft ) and is often called the " thousand @-@ mat room " because it has over 330 <unk> mats . The walls of the first floor have weapon racks ( <unk> , <unk> ) for holding matchlocks and spears , and at one point , the castle contained as many as 280 guns and 90 spears . The second floor has an area of roughly 550 m2 ( 5 @,@ 900 sq ft ) . 
 The third floor has an area of 440 m2 ( 4 @,@ 700 sq ft ) and the fourth floor has an area of 240 m2 ( 2 @,@ 600 sq ft ) . Both the third and fourth floors have platforms situated at the north and south windows called " stone @-@ throwing platforms " ( <unk> , <unk> ) , where defenders could observe or throw objects at attackers . They also have small enclosed rooms called " warrior hiding places " ( <unk> , <unk> ) , where defenders could hide themselves and kill attackers by surprise as they entered the keep . The final floor , the sixth floor , has an area of only 115 m2 ( 1 @,@ 240 sq ft ) . The sixth floor windows now have iron bars in place , but in the feudal period the panoramic view from the windows was unobstructed . 
 = = = Defenses = = = 
 Himeji Castle contains advanced defensive systems from the feudal period . Loopholes ( <unk> , sama ) in the shape of circles , triangles , squares , and rectangles are located throughout Himeji Castle , intended to allow defenders armed with <unk> or archers to fire on attackers without exposing themselves . Roughly 1 @,@ 000 loopholes exist in the castle buildings remaining today . <unk> chutes called " stone drop windows " ( <unk> , ishi @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> ) were also set at numerous points in the castle walls , enabling stones or boiling oil to be poured on the heads of attackers passing by underneath , and white plaster was used in the castle 's construction for its resistance to fire . 
 The castle complex included three moats , one of which — the outer moat — is now buried . Parts of the central moat and all of the inner moats survive . The moats have an average width of 20 m ( 66 ft ) , a maximum width of 34 @.@ 5 m ( 113 ft ) , and a depth of about 2 @.@ 7 m ( 8 @.@ 9 ft ) . The Three Country Moat ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> ) is a 2 @,@ 500 m2 ( 27 @,@ 000 sq ft ) pond which exists inside the castle ; one of the purposes of this moat was to store water for use in fire prevention . 
 The castle complex , particularly the Waist Quarter ( <unk> , <unk> ) , contains numerous warehouses that were used to store rice , salt , and water in case of a siege . A building known as the Salt Turret ( <unk> , <unk> ) was used specifically to store salt , and it is estimated that it contained as many as 3 @,@ 000 bags of salt when the castle complex was in use . The castle complex also contained 33 wells within the inner moat , 13 of which remain ; the deepest of these has a depth of 30 m ( 98 ft ) . 
 One of the castle 's most important defensive elements is the confusing maze of paths leading to the castle 's keep . The gates , baileys , and outer walls of the complex are organized so as to confuse an approaching force , causing it to travel in a spiral pattern around the complex on its way to the keep . The castle complex originally contained 84 gates , 15 of which were named according to the Japanese syllabary ( I , Ro , Ha , Ni , Ho , He , To , etc . ) . At present , 21 gates from the castle complex remain intact , 13 of which are named according to the Japanese syllabary . 
 In many cases , the castle walkways even turn back on themselves , greatly inhibiting navigation . For example , the straight distance from the <unk> Gate ( <unk> , <unk> ) to Main Keep ( 大天守 , daitenshu ) is only 130 m ( 430 ft ) , but the path itself is a much longer 325 m ( 1 @,@ 066 ft ) . The passages are also steep and narrow , further inhibiting entry . This system allowed the intruders to be watched and fired upon from the keep during their lengthy approach , but Himeji Castle was never attacked in this manner so the system remains untested . However , even today with the route clearly marked , many visitors have trouble navigating the castle complex .

 Himeji Castle is frequently known as <unk> @-@ jō or <unk> @-@ jō ( " White Egret Castle " or " White Heron Castle " ) because of its brilliant white exterior and supposed resemblance to a bird taking flight . The castle has been featured extensively in foreign and Japanese films , including the James Bond movie " You Only Live Twice " ( 1967 ) , and Akira Kurosawa 's <unk> ( 1980 ) and Ran ( 1985 ) . In the television miniseries Shōgun ( 1980 ) it served as a stand @-@ in for feudal @-@ era Osaka castle , which has lost the surrounding fortifications . In the video game Civilization Revolution , Himeji Castle is available to build as a world landmark . 
 = = = Lore and legend = = = 
 Himeji Castle is associated with a number of local legends . The well @-@ known <unk> ( or Japanese ghost story ) of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> , " The Dish Mansion at <unk> " ) is set in Edo ( Tokyo ) , but a variant called <unk> <unk> ( <unk> , " The Dish mansion in Harima Province " ) is set in Himeji Castle . There is a disputed claim that the castle is the bona fide location of the entire legend , and the alleged <unk> 's Well remains in the castle to this day . According to the legend , <unk> was falsely accused of losing dishes that were valuable family treasures , and then killed and thrown into the well . Her ghost remained to haunt the well at night , counting dishes in a despondent tone . 
 The legend of the " Old Widow 's Stone " ( <unk> , <unk> ) is another folklore story associated with the castle . According to the legend , Toyotomi Hideyoshi ran out of stones when building the original three @-@ story keep , and an old woman heard about his trouble . She gave him her hand millstone even though she needed it for her trade . It was said that people who heard the story were inspired and also offered stones to Hideyoshi , speeding up construction of the castle . To this day , the supposed stone can be seen covered with a wire net in the middle of one of the stone walls in the castle complex . 
 A folklore story is also associated with Sakurai <unk> , who was Ikeda Terumasa 's master carpenter in the construction of the keep . According to the legend , Sakurai was dissatisfied with his construction , feeling that the keep leaned a little to the southeast . Eventually , he became distraught and climbed to the top of the keep , where he jumped to his death with a chisel in his mouth .

 = Sam Loxton with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948 = 
 Sam Loxton was a member of Donald Bradman 's famous Australian cricket team , which toured England in 1948 . Bradman ’ s men went undefeated in their 34 matches ; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles . 
 A batting all rounder , Loxton played as a right @-@ handed middle @-@ order batsman and a right @-@ arm fast medium bowler who reinforced the frontline pace attack of Ray Lindwall , Keith Miller and Bill Johnston . Starting the tour as a fringe player , Loxton was omitted for the pre @-@ Test fixtures against Worcestershire and the Marylebone Cricket Club , where Australia traditionally fielded their full @-@ strength team . He was overlooked for the first two Tests ; reserve opening batsman Bill Brown played out of position in the middle @-@ order . However , Brown struggled in the unfamiliar role , and Loxton scored 159 not out against Gloucestershire to oust the former from his position for the Third Test at Old Trafford . Loxton scored 36 to help Australia avoid the follow on and salvage a draw , before making his most notable contribution in the Fourth Test at Headingley . He took 3 / 55 in the first innings and scored a counter @-@ attacking 93 on the third day to keep Australia in the game ; they went on to win after a world record @-@ breaking run @-@ chase on the final day . Loxton also played in the Fifth Test and ended the series with 144 runs at a batting average of 48 @.@ 00 and three wickets at a bowling average of 49 @.@ 33 . 
 In the tour matches , Loxton sometimes opened the bowling when Bradman sought to rest Lindwall and Miller to save their energy for the Tests , and he occasionally batted above the middle @-@ order . Loxton was the most economical , but the least incisive of the bowlers , and he never took more than three wickets in an innings . He played 22 first @-@ class matches and scored 973 runs at 57 @.@ 23 with three centuries , and took 32 wickets at 21 @.@ 71 . He was eighth in the run @-@ scoring aggregates , but was productive when given an opportunity , ranking fifth in the Australian averages . Loxton was the eighth @-@ leading wicket @-@ taker ; all seven frontline bowlers ahead of him took at least 50 wickets . Noted for his energetic and combative approach , Loxton was twice forced out of action for his troubles ; he pulled a groin while searching for extra pace with the ball early in the tour , and towards the end of the season , he hit a ball into his face and broke his nose . 
 = = Background = = 
 After serving in World War II , Loxton was demobilised and rose through the cricketing ranks to make his first @-@ class debut in 1946 – 47 . He was an all rounder — a right @-@ handed middle @-@ order batsman and a right @-@ arm fast bowler . During the 1947 – 48 Australian season , India toured Australia for five Tests , and the home team dominated , taking an unassailable 3 – 0 series lead after the first four matches . The Australian selectors then decided to use the Fifth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to give opportunities to players on the fringes of the national team to show their capabilities ahead of the 1948 tour of England . Loxton was one of several debutants , and he seized his chance . He scored 80 and took three wickets as an all rounder in the Australian victory , and was rewarded with inclusion in the 17 @-@ man touring party . 
 = = Early tour = = 
 Australia traditionally fielded its first @-@ choice team in the tour opener , which was usually against Worcestershire . Bradman and his co @-@ selectors felt that Loxton was not among the 11 strongest players , so he was not selected against Worcestershire . Loxton ’ s debut had come about because first @-@ choice opener Arthur Morris had been rested from the Fifth Test so that the selectors could trial potential players for the 1948 tour . Sid Barnes had opened in that match with Bill Brown . Morris and Barnes were Bradman 's preferred pair and they opened against Worcestershire , while Brown , who was on his third tour of England , was played out of position in the middle @-@ order , pushing Loxton out of the team . Loxton looked on as Brown made 25 and Australia won by an innings . 
 In the next match against Leicestershire , Loxton was given his first chance on English soil . Batting at No. 7 , he managed only four before being trapped leg before wicket by Australian expatriate left arm orthodox spinner Vic Jackson , as Australia amassed 448 . He then opened the bowling and castled home captain Les Berry for one to leave the hosts at 1 / 1 and take his first wicket on English soil . He also took two catches , both from the bowling of fellow Victorian Doug Ring as the hosts fell for 130 . Loxton again opened the bowling in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and dismissed the hosts for 147 to seal another innings win . Loxton took 1 / 11 and 0 / 12 from six and seven overs respectively . 
 The Australians then proceeded to play Yorkshire , on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling . Loxton bowled only one over , which was a maiden , before pulling his groin while trying to attain more pace , as the hosts were bowled out for 71 . He was unable to bat or bowl again in the game as Australia replied with 101 and then removed the hosts for 89 to leave themselves a target of 60 for victory . Australia came closest to losing for the whole tour . They fell to 6 / 31 , effectively seven down with Loxton unable to bat , before scraping home without further loss , although both batsmen at the crease survived chances . Due to his injury , Loxton was rested for the next two matches against Surrey at The Oval in London and Cambridge University . Australia won both matches by an innings . 
 In the following match against Essex , Loxton returned as Australia won the toss , batted first and went on to score a world record of 721 first @-@ class runs in one day ’ s play . Loxton came in at 4 / 452 and put on 56 with Ron Hamence and 166 with Ron Saggers in 65 minutes before falling at 6 / 664 for 120 . Loxton 's innings was noted for its hooking and driving and took around 80 minutes . During the innings , Loxton also passed 1 @,@ 000 first @-@ class career runs . Australia collapsed after Loxton 's departure , losing their last five wickets for 57 late on the first day . 
 Australia then proceeded to victory by an innings and 451 runs , their biggest winning margin for the tour . Loxton was not required to bowl in the first innings as the hosts fell for 83 in 36 @.@ 5 overs . In the second innings , Loxton was given the new ball and bowled 12 overs without success , conceding 28 runs before Essex were all out for 187 . 
 In the next match against Oxford University , Loxton came in at 4 / 206 and anchored the innings , remaining unbeaten on 79 as Australia were bowled out for 431 . He featured in partnerships with Colin McCool and Doug Ring , who both made fifties . He then took the new ball in both innings , taking 1 / 14 and 1 / 16 from five and eight overs respectively in another innings victory . When Oxford batted , Philip Whitcombe struck a delivery from Ernie Toshack to Loxton , and took a few steps out of his crease . Loxton prepared to throw at the Whitcombe 's stumps in a run out attempt , but did not release , while Whitcombe stood his ground outside the crease . In those days , the fielding standards were lower , with weaker and less accurate throws and Whitcombe was only a metre or two outside his crease , while Loxton was around thirty away . The next delivery from Toshack was again hit to Loxton , and Whitcombe again wandered outside his crease . This time Loxton threw the ball and hit the stumps directly , running out the batsman , who was unable to comprehend what had happened and shook his head . 
 The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) at Lord 's . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and were basically a full strength Test team , while Australia fielded their first @-@ choice team . It was a chance for all players to gain a psychological advantage over their opponents for the Tests . 
 Loxton had scored 203 runs in three innings at an average of 101 @.@ 50 , but was not selected , nor was middle @-@ order batsman Harvey , who had scored a century in the previous Test against India . Harvey struggled to adapt to English conditions at the start of his first tour and made only 83 runs at 16 @.@ 60 in five innings on tour . Brown , who had scored 527 runs at 75 @.@ 28 for the season so far , including three centuries in his last three innings , was played out of position in the middle @-@ order , even though he had batted as an opener in every tour match other than against Worcestershire . Due to the rotation policy in the tour matches , only two of the three openers Brown , Morris and Barnes played in any one game while the other rested , except when Bradman tried to fit all three in a full @-@ strength team by having Brown in the middle @-@ order . The team was exactly the same as for the opening fixture against Worcestershire . 
 Barring one change in the bowling department , the same team went on to be selected for the First Test , with the top six batsmen in the same position . Brown made only 26 as Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings . 
 The MCC match was followed by Australia 's first non @-@ victory of the tour , which was against Lancashire . Loxton top @-@ scored with 39 as Australia batted first and were bowled out for 204 after the first day was washed out . He then took 0 / 18 from eight overs and made 52 in the second innings before being run out while batting with Harvey as the match ended in a draw . In the second innings , Loxton attempted to attack the bowling of Malcolm Hilton — who had troubled Bradman in the first innings — in an attempt to throw him off his game . However , Hilton had the last laugh and removed Bradman for the second time . 
 In the following match against Nottinghamshire , Loxton took a total of 0 / 21 from 12 overs and was run out for 16 as Australia played out another draw . In the next fixture against Hampshire , Australia had another scare . On a drying pitch , Loxton took 1 / 2 , ending the resistance of top @-@ scorer John Arnold for 48 as Australia removed the hosts for 195 . He then made a duck as Australia suffered a middle @-@ order collapse and were dismissed for 117 . It was the first time that Bradman ’ s men had conceded a first innings lead during the campaign . Loxton then took 0 / 6 from five overs as Hampshire were bowled out for 103 to leave Australia a victory target of 182 in 175 minutes . He was not required as Australia ’ s top @-@ order batted steadily to take an eight @-@ wicket win . The final match before the First Test was against Sussex . Loxton opened the bowling and took 3 / 13 from 10 overs as the hosts fell for 86 in 46 @.@ 4 overs . Australia then declared at 5 / 549 before he could bat . Loxton was not asked to bowl as Sussex were out for 138 to seal another innings victory . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Sussex 's display was " as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew " . 
 = = First Test = = 
 Up to this point , Brown had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72 @.@ 72 , while Loxton had made 310 runs at 51 @.@ 66 . Harvey had scored only 296 runs at 42 @.@ 29 . The other five places in the top six were firmly entrenched in the hands of Barnes , Morris , Bradman , Hassett and Miller , who had all played in those positions regularly since the end of World War II . Brown gained selection out of position in the middle order in the First Test at Trent Bridge , while Loxton and Harvey watched from the sidelines . There was a chance one of them would receive a last @-@ minute call @-@ up as Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week leading up to the Test , but the opener recovered . Brown made only 17 as Australia won by eight wickets . 
 Between Tests , Loxton played in the match against Northamptonshire , which started the day after Trent Bridge . With pace spearhead Ray Lindwall injured and Keith Miller rested following a marathon effort in the opening Test , Loxton opened the bowling and took 2 / 22 from 15 overs the hosts were dismissed for 119 . He made only 17 with the bat and took 0 / 7 , again opening in the second innings as Australia cruised to victory by an innings . Loxton was rested for the second match before the Second Test , against Yorkshire ; Brown scored a century in a drawn match . 
 = = Second Test = = 
 Australia opted to field an unchanged line @-@ up for the Second Test at Lord 's . Brown managed only 24 and 32 in the middle order as Australia won by 409 runs . Including the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC , he had totalled 123 runs at 24 @.@ 60 in his five innings in the middle @-@ order . O 'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown , who was noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role . He said that although Brown had made an unbeaten double century on his previous Test at Lord 's in 1938 , Loxton and Harvey had better claims to selection . 
 The next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Test . Bradman wanted to allow his leading players a lighter workload after their effort at Lord ’ s , and Miller had an unauthorised night of partying and did not return to the team hotel until dawn , so Loxton opened the bowling , and he took two quick wickets to leave the hosts at 2 / 14 . Loxton ended with 2 / 37 from 25 overs , sending down the most deliveries among the Australians , as the hosts were all out for 221 . He made eight with the bat and again opened the bowling in the second innings , taking 1 / 53 from 18 overs . Australia needed 122 in the final innings to win , and Loxton and Harvey were promoted after the latter offered to open . Bradman ’ s men wanted to finish the run @-@ chase quickly so they could watch the Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon final . Harvey and Loxton , who were room @-@ mates during the tour , made the runs in only 58 minutes in 20 @.@ 1 overs , with Loxton unbeaten on 47 , to complete a 10 @-@ wicket win . 
 The following match against Gloucestershire at Bristol was the last before the Third Test and Loxton 's final chance to push his claims for Test duties . Australia reached 7 / 774 declared , its highest score of the tour , laying the foundation for a victory by an innings and 363 runs . Loxton came in at 4 / 466 and put on 63 with Harvey , before his fellow Victorian was out for 95 . He then added 104 with Colin McCool and 105 with Ian Johnson . Loxton was on 159 when Johnson lost his wicket , which prompted acting captain Lindsay Hassett to declare the innings closed . Loxton 's innings involved a series of powerful strokes that went for six and he was particularly noted for using his feet to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard . The Gloucestershire bowler had been touted as a possible Test selection , because the other England bowlers had failed to contain Australia ’ s batsman in the first two matches , but his chances of selection were ended with the tourists ’ assault at Bristol . Immediately after the declaration , Loxton opened the bowling and ended with 1 / 22 from as Gloucestershire were all out for 269 . Hassett enforced the follow on and Loxton again started proceedings with the ball , but only for two overs . The home side were bowled out for 132 to complete another Australian victory . 
 = = Third Test = = 
 Australia and England reassembled at Old Trafford for the Third Test . Following his unbeaten 159 in the previous match and Brown 's struggles when playing in the middle @-@ order , Loxton took Brown 's position . Brown had scored 25 , 26 , 17 , 24 and 32 in the middle @-@ order in the matches against Worcestershire , the MCC and the first two Tests . As fast bowling all rounder Keith Miller had been struggling with a back injury that prevented him from bowling from time to time , Loxton was seen as a necessary reinforcement for the frontline bowlers . England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat , and Loxton bowled first change , sending down seven overs for the loss of 18 runs . The Australians themselves opened with Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball , but Bradman had misjudged the breeze and needed to swap his bowlers ' ends . For this purpose , Loxton bowled a solitary over , his first in Ashes cricket . He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant George Emmett , who ignored the opportunity to attack and let the balls pass . 
 On the second morning , English tailender Alec Bedser had reached 37 . His partner Denis Compton hit a ball into the covers and Bradman and Loxton collided in an attempt to field the ball and prevent a run . Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield , but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket @-@ keeper 's end . Bedser was a long way short of the crease and was run out . The wicket ended an innings of 145 minutes , in which Bedser scored 37 in a 121 @-@ run partnership . England then lost their last three wickets for 26 runs to be all out for 363 . 
 On the third day , Loxton and wicket @-@ keeper Don Tallon both came to the crease with Australia in difficulty at 5 / 139 . Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before the gloveman was caught behind from Bill Edrich . Lindwall came to the crease to join Loxton at 6 / 172 as Australia faced the prospect of being forced to follow on . The pair added a further 36 before Loxton was bowled by Dick Pollard , leaving Australia 7 / 208 , still five runs behind the follow on mark , which they scraped past to end with 221 . Loxton again bowled first change in the second innings , taking 0 / 29 from eight overs as England reached 3 / 174 at the end of the third day . Loxton narrowly missed out on a catch when opener Cyril Washbrook had appeared unsettled by some short @-@ pitched bowling from the Australians . A few uncontrolled hook shots flew in the air , and one of these barely evaded Loxton at fine leg . The fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting after rain delayed the start on the final day . Play began after the tea break , and Australia needed to score 317 in the last session , while England required ten wickets for victory . Loxton did not bat as Australia reached 1 / 92 from 61 overs when the match was finally ended by a series of periodic rain interruptions . 
 After the Test , Loxton bowled first change in the first innings against Middlesex . He took 3 / 33 from 21 overs as the hosts were bowled out for 203 . Loxton removed Leslie Compton , his younger brother and England Test batsman Denis , and Jim Sims in the space of five runs to reduce Middlesex from 5 / 182 to 8 / 188 . He had a heavier workload than normal in the first innings , as leading paceman Lindwall had turned up inebriated on the first morning and therefore lacked energy and penetration . Loxton then joined Morris at the crease , with Australia in difficulty at 3 / 53 . They put on 172 in 115 minutes before Morris was out for 109 , and Loxton followed him at 5 / 271 for the top @-@ score of 123 , having punished the bowlers in a hard @-@ hitting display . Australia then collapsed to be all out for 317 . Loxton took 1 / 15 in the second innings to help seal victory by ten wickets in Australia 's only county match before the Fourth Test . 
 = = Fourth Test = = 
 The teams headed to Headingley in Leeds for the Fourth Test . Harvey came in for the injured Barnes , joining Loxton in the middle @-@ order . Brown was not recalled to join Morris at the top of the order ; instead , Hassett was promoted as a makeshift opener . 
 England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch that was expected to be unhelpful for fast bowling . Opener Len Hutton was dropped by Hassett on 25 , after flicking the ball behind square leg from Loxton ’ s bowling . This proved to be costly , as Hutton reached 81 before falling at 1 / 168 . England were 2 / 268 at the end of the first day . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Australia 's day went " progressively downhill " and said that it was the country ’ s worst day of bowling since World War II , citing the proliferation of full tosses . 
 On the second morning , the nightwatchman Alec Bedser was attacking Australia . He took 14 from one Ernie Toshack over , before taking another 14 from an Ian Johnson over soon after to reach 47 . Loxton was brought on and Bedser hit a ball back near his grasp , but it narrowly evaded him . Bedser reached 79 and England 2 / 423 when he finally fell , triggering a collapse . At 6 / 486 , Loxton bowled Ken Cranston for 10 to take his first Ashes wicket . Cranston opted to not play at a ball that went straight into his leg stump . Loxton then removed Godfrey Evans and Jim Laker in quick succession as England fell to 496 / 9 . Evans fell meekly , prodding a ball straight to Hassett at silly mid @-@ on , prompting O 'Reilly to say that Loxton was " lucky to be on deck when the English tail were falling over themselves in their nervous speed to commit hara @-@ kiri " . In contrast , Laker edged Loxton down the leg side and it took a diving , low catch from Saggers to complete the dismissal . Umpire Baldwin asked his colleague Chester at square leg to confirm that the ball had carried on the full before sending Laker back to the pavilion . Miller then took the final wicket without further addition to the score . Loxton ended with 3 / 55 from 26 overs , the second best economy rate among the Australians . On the third morning , Loxton came to the crease to join Harvey with the score at 4 / 189 . Australia had been in trouble after losing two quick wickets to be 3 / 68 , but Miller and Harvey counterattacked , adding 121 runs in 90 minutes , their batting likened by Wisden to a " hurricane " . Fingleton said that he had never " known a more enjoyable hour " of " delectable cricket " . Harvey was unperturbed by Miller 's departure , hitting 11 from three consecutive balls . Australia went to lunch at 4 / 204 , with Harvey on 70 . 
 After lunch , Australia scored slowly as Loxton struggled to come to grips with the bowling . Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen , but instead , Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly . He lofted Pollard to the leg side , almost for six , and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler . Harvey accelerated as well , and 80 minutes into the session , reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250 . On each occasion , umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd , trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena . They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester ’ s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes . Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting . He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six , eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players . It also brought up a century stand , which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes . Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls , but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England 's firm control . 
 Harvey 's departure at 5 / 294 meant that the first of the bowlers , Johnson , entered the ground . This did not deter Loxton , who was particularly severe on Laker , lifting him into the crowd for four more sixes . Loxton hit two over the leg side followed by consecutive off drives into the gallery . Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 6 / 329 . Fifteen runs later , Yardley bowled Loxton for 93 . Loxton appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross @-@ batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning . Lindwall then made 77 to propel Australia to 458 on the fourth day , just 38 runs in arrears . 
 In the second innings , Loxton took 0 / 29 from ten overs , and England batted on for five minutes on the final morning , adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 8 / 365 . Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller . This would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin , therefore making life more difficult for Australia ’ s batsmen . 
 Yardley ’ s declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory . At the time , this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side . Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target , but they completed their task with 15 minutes to spare and seven wickets in hand to seal the series 3 – 0 , with Loxton not required to bat . 
 After the Headingley Test , Loxton came in at 5 / 344 and made an attacking 51 as Australia batted first and made 456 against Derbyshire . He then took 1 / 27 from 17 @.@ 4 overs in the first innings . Australia enforced the follow on and Loxton took the first wicket before returning to take two tail @-@ end wickets and end with 3 / 16 from 13 @.@ 4 overs as Australia won by an innings . Loxton was the most economical of the Australian wicket @-@ takers . After six consecutive matches , Loxton was rested for the rain @-@ affected draw against Glamorgan , which did not reach the second innings . The hosts were bowled out for 197 and Australia reached 3 / 215 when inclement weather ended the match . 
 Loxton returned in the next match and claimed both openers to end with 2 / 27 from 19 overs as Warwickshire were bowled out for 138 in their first innings . He then made a duck as Australia struggled to 254 in reply . Loxton bowled six overs and took 0 / 15 in the second innings before Australia won by nine wickets . Australia then faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour . Loxton did little , scoring two in his only innings and taking a match total of 1 / 32 , his victim being Test batsman Jack Ikin . In the non @-@ first @-@ class game against Durham , a rain @-@ affected draw that did not reach the second innings , Loxton made 15 in Australia 's 282 and then took 1 / 8 from six overs as the hosts reached 5 / 73 before rain washed out the match after the first day . 
 = = Fifth Test = = 
 Australia then headed to The Oval for the Fifth Test . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain @-@ affected pitch . England were dismissed for 52 in 42 @.@ 1 overs on the first afternoon ; Loxton bowled only two overs for one run as the frontline pacemen made light work of the hosts . His other notable action in the field occurred when Len Hutton the first runs of the match , a single in the first over . This had almost turned into a five when Loxton fired in a wide return , but Barnes managed to prevent from going for four overthrows . Loxton came in on the second day with the score at 5 / 265 and accompanied the centurion Morris for 39 further runs before Edrich had him caught behind for 15 . He appeared uncomfortable with the outswingers and leg cutters of Bedser , and was beaten several times , before Edrich dismissed him . Australia ended at 389 . Loxton was economical in the second innings , taking 0 / 16 from 10 overs as Australia dismissed the hosts for 188 to seal the series 4 – 0 with another innings victory . 
 = = Later tour matches = = 
 Seven matches remained on Bradman 's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat . Loxton made 16 of 361 as Australia batted first against Kent . He came on late in the first innings and took three of the last four wickets as the hosts fell for 51 in just 23 overs . Loxton bowled all of his victims as the hosts fell from 5 / 48 to 51 all out . It was a similar tale in the second innings , as Loxton removed opener Jack Davies for a duck and ended with 1 / 12 from six overs as the hosts fell for 124 in only 32 @.@ 5 overs . Australia had won the match by an innings within two days . In the next fixture against the Gentlemen of England , Loxton made only 17 as Australia eventually declared at 5 / 610 against a team that featured eight Test players . Loxton then took a match total of 0 / 37 from 21 overs as Australia completed another innings victory . Loxton was rested for the next match against Somerset , which the tourists won by an innings . Loxton then returned against the South of England . He came in at 5 / 427 and struck an unbeaten 67 in 75 minutes , before Australia declared at 7 / 522 . He took 1 / 17 from 11 overs , removing Charlie Barnett as the hosts were bowled out for 298 in their first innings when rain ended the match . 
 Australia 's biggest challenge in the post @-@ Test tour matches was against the Leveson @-@ Gower 's XI . During the last Australian campaign in 1938 , this team was effectively a full @-@ strength England outfit , but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play . Bradman then fielded a full @-@ strength team , with the only difference from the Fifth Test line @-@ up being the inclusion of Johnson at the expense of Doug Ring . The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177 , with Loxton taking 0 / 12 . Loxton came in at 2 / 327 and made 12 , before sweeping a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face and breaking his nose . He retired hurt and took no further part in the match . Australia declared at 8 / 469 and the hosts were 2 / 75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays . 
 The tour ended with two non @-@ first @-@ class matches against Scotland . Following his injury , Loxton played in neither ; Australia won both by an innings . While in Scotland , Loxton 's nose was operated on in Edinburgh . Following his injury , Loxton eschewed the sweep shot and advised students to do the same , exhorting them to move onto the front foot to drive instead . 
 = = Role = = 
 A batting all @-@ rounder , Loxton played as a right @-@ handed middle @-@ order batsman and a right @-@ arm fast medium bowler who reinforced the frontline pace attack of Lindwall , Miller and Bill Johnston . When fit , the trio all bowled before Loxton in the Tests . With medium pacer Ernie Toshack and off spinner Ian Johnson also playing in the Third and Fourth Tests , Loxton was the sixth bowler . In the Fifth Test , Johnson was replaced by leg spinner Ring and the injured Toshack was replaced by a batsman , so Loxton became the fifth bowler . Of the seven regular bowlers , Loxton was the only one who was not a frontline bowler , and as such he had the worst average , the second @-@ worst economy rate and the third @-@ worst strike rate . Loxton ended the Test series with 144 runs at 48 @.@ 00 and three wickets at 49 @.@ 33 , having bowled 63 overs . Loxton batted at No. 6 or No. 7 during the Tests , and was the last batsman in the batting order before the wicket @-@ keeper and the bowlers . 
 In the tour matches , Loxton sometimes opened the bowling when Bradman sought to rest Lindwall and Miller in order to conserve their energy for the Tests , such as in both innings of the match against Northamptonshire and the second match against Surrey . In his 22 first @-@ class innings , he batted twice at No. 4 and opened in one innings , but he was otherwise invariably in the middle @-@ order between No. 5 and No. 7.N- Loxton was the most economical of those who bowled more than 70 overs , but also the least incisive , taking a wicket every 67 @.@ 75 balls , and he never took more than three wickets in an innings , which he managed on three occasions . He played 22 first @-@ class matches and scored 973 runs at 57 @.@ 23 with three centuries and took 32 wickets at 21 @.@ 71 . Loxton was eighth in the run @-@ scoring aggregates , but was given less opportunities than the other frontline batsmen who scored more heavily ; whereas he had 22 innings , they all had at least 26 innings and tended to bat higher in the order . However , Loxton was productive when given a chance , ranking fifth in the averages . Loxton was the eighth @-@ leading wicket @-@ taker ; all seven ahead of him took at least 50 wickets . 
 Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack summed up his contribution thus : 
 A fine driving batsman with a fierce square cut , Loxton achieved little as a bowler , but he played his part as an all @-@ rounder , one of many in the team ; in addition to his batting feats , he kept the game alive by his unlimited enthusiasm . Whether in stopping the ball or hurling down the wicket from almost any angle , he won the admiration of all who appreciated keenness in the field .

 = Belgium national football team = 
 The Belgian national football team has officially represented Belgium in association football since their maiden match in 1904 . The squad is under the global jurisdiction of FIFA and is governed in Europe by UEFA — both of which were co @-@ founded by the Belgian team 's supervising body , the Royal Belgian Football Association ( RBFA ) . Periods of regular Belgian representation at the highest international level , from 1920 to 1938 , and 1970 to 2002 , have alternated with mostly unsuccessful qualification rounds . Most of Belgium 's home games are played at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels . 
 Belgium 's national team have participated in three , quadrennial major football competitions . They appeared in the end stages of twelve FIFA World Cups and five UEFA European Football Championships , and featured at three Olympic football tournaments , including the 1920 Olympic tournament which they won . Other notable performances are victories over four reigning world champions — West Germany , Brazil , Argentina and France — between 1954 and 2002 . Belgium has longstanding football rivalries with its Dutch and French counterparts , having played both teams nearly every year from 1905 to 1967 . The squad has been known as the Red Devils since 1906 ; its supporters ' group is named 1895 . 
 During the national player career of forward Paul Van Himst , the most @-@ praised Belgian footballer of the 20th century , Belgium took third place at Euro 1972 . After that , they experienced two golden ages with many gifted players . In the first period , which lasted from the 1980s to the early 1990s , the team finished as runners @-@ up at Euro 1980 and fourth in the 1986 World Cup . In the second , under guidance of Marc Wilmots in the 2010s , Belgium topped the FIFA World Rankings for the first time in November 2015 . 
 = = History = = 
 Belgium was one of the first mainland European countries to play association football . Its practice in Belgium began on 26 October 1863 , after an Irish student walked into the <unk> College of Melle with a leather ball . Initially an elitist pastime , during the following decades association football supplanted rugby as Belgium 's most popular football sport . On 1 September 1895 , ten clubs for football , athletics , cricket and cycling founded the Belgian sports board Union Belge des Sociétés de Sports Athlétiques ( UBSSA ) ; a year later UBSSA organised the first annual league in Belgian football . 
 On 11 October 1900 , <unk> AC honorary president Jorge Díaz announced that Antwerp would host a series of challenge matches between Europe 's best football teams . After some organisational problems , on 28 April 1901 , <unk> 's pitch hosted its first tournament , in which a Belgian A @-@ squad and a Dutch B @-@ team contested the Coupe Vanden <unk> . Belgium won , and also beat the Netherlands in all three follow @-@ up games ; FIFA does not recognise these results because Belgium fielded some English players . On 1 May 1904 , the Belgians played their first official game , against France at the Stade du Vivier d <unk> in Uccle ; their draw left the <unk> Coppée Trophy unclaimed . Twenty days later , the football boards of both countries , and five other nations , founded FIFA . At that time , the Belgian squad was chosen by a committee drawn from the country 's six or seven major clubs . In 1906 , the national team players received the nickname Red Devils because of their red jerseys , and four years later , former Scottish footballer William Maxwell replaced the UBSSA committee as their manager . In 1912 , UBSSA began governing football only and was renamed <unk> . During the Great War , the national team only played unrecognised friendlies , with games in and against France . 
 At the 1920 Summer Olympics , in their first official Olympic appearance , the Red Devils won the gold medal on home soil after a controversial final in which their Czechoslovak opponents left the pitch . This triumph led them to an all @-@ time high second place in the World Football Elo Ratings . In the three 1920s Summer Olympics , they achieved fair results ( four wins in seven games ) , and played their first intercontinental match , against Argentina . Over the following decade , however , Belgium lost all of their matches at the first three FIFA World Cup final tournaments . According to historian Richard Henshaw , " The growth of [ football ] in Scandinavia , Central Europe , and South America left Belgium far behind " . Although World War II hindered international football events in the 1940s , the traditional derby against the Netherlands was kept alive with unofficial matches . 
 Belgium qualified for only one of eight major tournaments during the 1950s and the 1960s : the 1954 World Cup . According to journalist Henry <unk> , some of his Swiss colleagues regarded the 1954 Belgian team as " favourites for the world title " after a promising draw in the opener against England . However , they were eliminated after a loss to Italy in the second ( and last ) group match . The day before the tournament began , the Belgian , French and Italian football boards founded UEFA . Two bright spots in these decades were wins against World Cup holders : West Germany in 1954 , and Brazil in 1963 . In between , Belgium defeated Hungary 's Golden Team in 1956 . The combination of failure in competitive games , and success in exhibition matches , gave the Belgians the mock title of " world champion of the friendlies " . 
 The team 's performance improved during the early 1970s , under manager Raymond Goethals . Fully dressed in white , as the White Devils , Belgium had their first victories at World and European Championships at the 1970 World Cup and Euro 1972 . At that Euro appearance , their first , they finished third by winning the consolation match against Hungary . In 1973 , the denial of a match @-@ winning goal in their last 1974 World Cup qualifier cost Belgium their appearance at the finals . The next two attempts to reach a major finals were also fruitless . Beginning with a second @-@ place finish at Euro 1980 , the 1980s and the early 1990s are generally considered as Belgium 's first golden age . Coached by Guy Thys , they achieved their spot in the 1980 final with an unbeaten record in the group phase ; in the final , they narrowly lost the title to West Germany with the score 1 – 2 . Starting with the 1982 World Cup , and ending with the 2002 World Cup , the national team qualified for six consecutive World Cup end stages and mostly progressed to the second round . During this period , managers Guy Thys , Paul Van Himst and Robert Waseige each guided a Belgian selection past the first round . In addition to receiving individual FIFA recognitions , the team reached the semi @-@ finals of the 1986 World Cup . After reaching the Euro 1980 final , they were unsuccessful at subsequent European Championships , with early exits from their appearances at Euro 1984 and Euro 2000 . During the late 1990s , they played three friendly tournaments in Morocco , Cyprus and Japan , sharing the 1999 Kirin Cup with Peru in the latter . The greatest talents of the Belgian team during this golden age were retired from international football by 2000 , yet in 2002 , Belgium defeated reigning world champions France , and reached the World Cup round of 16 . 
 After the 2002 World Cup , the team weakened with the loss of more veterans and coach Waseige . They failed to qualify for five successive major finals from Euro 2004 until Euro 2012 , and went through an equal number of head coaches . In between , a promising new generation was maturing at the 2007 European U @-@ 21 Championship ; Belgium 's squad qualified for the following year 's Summer Olympics in Beijing , where the Young Red Devils squad finished fourth . Seventeen of them appeared in the senior national team , albeit without making an immediate impact . Belgium finished in second ( and last ) place at the Kirin Cup in May 2009 , and lost against the 125th FIFA @-@ ranked team of Armenia in September 2009 . After Georges Leekens ' second stint as national manager , his assistant Marc Wilmots became the caretaker in May 2012 . 
 After two matches as interim coach , Wilmots agreed to replace Leekens as manager . Following his appointment , the team 's results improved , such that some foreign media regarded it as another Belgian golden generation . The young Belgian squad qualified as unbeaten group winners for the 2014 World Cup finals , and earned Belgium 's second ever place in a World Cup quarter @-@ finals with a four @-@ game winning streak . Belgium qualified for Euro 2016 with a match to spare in October 2015 , and took the top spot in the FIFA World Rankings for the first time in November 2015 , to stay first for five months . In the following year , Belgium could not confirm their role as outsider at the European Championship with a quarter @-@ final exit ; this prompted the RBFA to dismiss Wilmots . In the 2018 World Cup qualifying allocation , they were seeded first in their group . 
 = = Kit = = 
 In home matches , the team 's outfield players traditionally wear the colours of the Belgian flag : black , yellow and red . Red dominates the strip and is often the sole jersey colour , hence the Red Devils nickname . The away colours are usually white , black or both ; in 2014 , the squad introduced a third , yellow kit . Their shirts are often trimmed with tricolores at the margins . Since 1981 , the RBFA emblem has been the national team 's badge ; the previous badge was a yellow lion on a black shield , similar to the escutcheon of the national coat of arms . 
 For their first unofficial match in 1901 , the Belgian team wore white jerseys with tricoloured bands on the upper arms . Around their third unofficial game in 1902 , it was decided that they would put on a " shirt with national colours ... [ that would indicate , ] with a stripe , the number of times every player has participated in an encounter " . Since 1904 , Belgium 's classic all @-@ red jersey design has been altered twice . In 1904 – 05 , the squad briefly wore satin shirts with three horizontal bands in red , yellow and black ; according to sports journalist Victor <unk> , the shirts set " the ugliness record " . During the 1970s , manager Raymond Goethals chose an all @-@ white combination to improve the team 's visibility during evening matches ; as a result , they were temporarily known as the White Devils . 
 Six clothing manufacturers have supplied the official team strip . Since 2014 , it has been produced by Adidas , who was also the supplier from 1974 to 1980 , and from 1982 to 1991 . Former kit manufacturers are Umbro ( 1970 – 1973 ) , Admiral ( 1981 – 1982 ) , Diadora ( 1992 – 1999 ) , Nike ( 1999 – 2010 ) and <unk> ( 2010 – 2014 ) . 
 = = Home stadium = = 
 Numerous former and current venues in 11 urban areas have hosted Belgium 's home games . Most of these matches have been played in Brussels at the Heysel Plateau , on the site of the present @-@ day King Baudouin Stadium — a multipurpose facility with a seating capacity of 50 @,@ 122 . Its field also hosts the team 's final training sessions before domestic games . Since 2007 , most physical preparation takes place at the National Football Centre in Tubize , or at Anderlecht 's training ground in the <unk> quarter . Apart from Belgian home friendlies , at the international level Belgium 's national stadium has also hosted six European Championship games . 
 In 1930 , for the country 's centennial , the venue was christened the Jubilee Stadium with an unofficial match between Belgium and the Netherlands . At that time , the stadium had a capacity of 75 @,@ 000 . In 1946 , it was renamed Heysel Stadium after its city quarter . This new name became associated with the tragedy preceding the 1985 European Cup final between Juventus and Liverpool ; 39 spectators died after riots in the then antiquated building . Three years after the disaster , plans were unveiled for a renovation ; in 1995 , after two years of work , the modernised stadium was named after the late King Baudouin . In May 2013 , the Brussels @-@ Capital Region announced that the King Baudouin Stadium would be replaced by <unk> , elsewhere on the Heysel Plateau ; two years later , a 2019 date was set for the stadium 's completion .

 = = = Media coverage = = = 
 The first live coverage of a Belgian sporting event occurred on 3 May 1931 when journalist Gust De <unk> commentated on the international football game between Belgium and the Netherlands on radio . Later , football broadcasts were also televised . As 60 per cent of Belgians speak Dutch and 40 per cent French , commentaries for the national team matches are provided in both languages . The games are not broadcast in German — the third official language in Belgium . During Belgium 's tournament appearances in the 1980s and the early 1990s , Rik De <unk> crowned himself the nation 's most famous football commentator with his emotional and humorous reports . 
 Initially the matches were transmitted mainly on public television channels : the former <unk> in Dutch , and the RTBF in French . Since 1994 , commercial channels such as <unk> and its sister channel <unk> 2 , and <unk> in Flanders , have purchased broadcasting rights . As of July 2016 , the round @-@ of @-@ 16 match against the United States at the 2014 World Cup was the most @-@ watched programme in Belgian television history , with an audience of over four million viewers out of 11 @.@ 3 million Belgian citizens . 
 In April 2014 , the VRT started transmitting a nine @-@ piece , behind @-@ the @-@ scenes documentary about the national team filmed during the 2014 World Cup qualifiers , titled <unk> <unk> ( Everybody Devil ) . Cable broadband provider Telenet broadcast an eight part documentary about individual players titled Rode Helden ( Red Heroes ) . 
 = = = Actions = = = 
 Multiple events were organised for the fans during the squad 's peak popularity in the 2010s . During the 2014 World Cup qualifiers , a string of interactive events called the Devil Challenges were organised . The premise was that small groups of international players would do a favour in return for each of the five comprehensive chores their supporters completed ( " colour Belgium red " , " gather 500 @,@ 000 decibels " , etc . ) , all of which were accomplished . In June 2013 , the Belgian national team 's first ever Fan Day attracted over 20 @,@ 000 supporters ; a second was held after the 2014 World Cup . On the days of Belgium 's 2014 World Cup group matches , large dance events titled Dance with the Devils ( a pun on the title of a 2001 D @-@ Devils ' trance album ) took place in three Belgian cities . This type of happening was repeated during Belgium 's Euro 2016 group matches , in Antwerp 's Lotto Arena . 
 Occasionally , the Belgian team directly supported charity . They played at minimum five unofficial games of which the returns were for charitable purposes : two against France , in 1914 and in 1916 , and three against the Netherlands , in 1926 , 1932 and 1941 . In mid @-@ 1986 , when the Belgian delegation reached the Mexico World Cup semi @-@ finals , the squad started a project titled Casa Hogar , an idea of delegation leader Michel D <unk> . Casa Hogar is a home for street children in the Mexican industrial city of Toluca , to which the footballers donated part of their tournament bonuses . In August 2013 , the national team supported four social projects through the charity fund Football + Foundation , by playing an A @-@ match with a plus sign on the shoulders of their jerseys and auctioning the shirts . 
 In 2002 , the national squad held its first anti @-@ racism campaign in which they posed with slogans . A home Euro 2012 qualifier was given the theme of respect for diversity in 2010 ; this UEFA @-@ supported action was part of the European <unk> Action Week . Ex @-@ Red Devil Dimitri <unk> — the first black Belgium player ( in 1987 ) — was engaged as godfather , and other foreign , current , and former footballers who played in the Belgian top division participated . 
 = = = Supporters = = = 
 Fans of the Belgian national team display the country 's tricolour national flag , usually with an emphasis on the red element . In 2012 , local supporter clubs merged into one large Belgian federation named 1895 after the foundation year of the RBFA . One year later , 1895 had 24 @,@ 000 members . The nationwide interest in the football squad has also been reflected by the occasional presence of Belgian monarchs at their matches since 1914 . One of the greatest moments for the Belgian team and their 12th man was in mid @-@ 1986 when the Belgian delegation at the Mexico World Cup received a warm " welcome home " . When the World Cup semi @-@ finalists appeared on the balcony of Brussels Town Hall , the adjoining Grand Place square was filled with an ecstatic crowd that cheered as though their squad had won a major tournament . 
 The team 's deterioration after the 2002 World Cup lead to their absence from the end stages of the next five major tournaments , and strained the national side 's popularity . Between 2004 and 2010 , local journalists called the Belgian footballing nation " mortally ill " . Some fans continued to support their squad in bad times . Ludo <unk> was one of the most loyal fans attending the team 's games worldwide since 1990 , missing only the Japanese Kirin Cup in 1999 , and two other matches by 2006 . He was the only supporter to attend their game in Armenia in 2009 . In 2008 , hope surged when Belgium 's U @-@ 23 won fourth place at the Olympics in Beijing ; several of these Olympians later appeared on the senior team . 
 Just before the kick @-@ off of a 2014 World Cup home qualifier , Belgium 's footballers saw a first <unk> banner , sized 10 @.@ 5 by 11 @.@ 5 metres ( 34 by 38 ft ) depicting a devil in the national colours . The presence of many Belgian players in top leagues abroad , such as the Premier League , and promising results under Marc Wilmots , increased fans ' enthusiasm and belief in a successful World Cup campaign . Because of this popularity peak , two Belgian monuments were decorated in national colours for the 2014 FIFA World Cup event ; the Manneken Pis statue received a child @-@ sized version of the new Belgian uniform , and facets of the <unk> 's upper sphere were covered in black , yellow and red vinyl . 
 = = = Nickname and logo = = = 
 After a 1905 match , a Dutch reporter wrote that three Belgian footballers " work [ ed ] as devils " . A year later Léopold FC manager Pierre <unk> nicknamed the players Red Devils , inspired by their jersey colour , and the achievement of three successive victories in 1906 . Since 2012 , the team logo is a red trident ( or three @-@ pronged pitchfork ) , an item that is often associated with the devil . Before that , the national squad had three official <unk> mascots . The first was a lion in team kit named <unk> , a reference to the central symbol in the Belgian coat of arms that appeared on the team jerseys from 1905 to 1980 . In accordance with their epithet , the next mascots were a red super @-@ devil and a fan @-@ made modern devil . 
 = = Rivalries = = 
 Belgium 's main football rivals are its neighbours the Netherlands and France , with which it shares close cultural and political relations . The matchup between the Belgian and Dutch team is known as the Low Countries derby ; as of June 2016 they have played each other in 125 official games . The clash between the Belgian and French sides is nicknamed le Match Sympathique in French ( " the Friendly Match " ) ; they have contested 73 official games as of June 2016 . 
 Belgium won the first four — unofficial — matches against the Netherlands , but lost their first FIFA @-@ recognised contest . The two national teams played each other biannually between 1905 and 1964 , except during the World Wars . They have met 18 times in major tournament campaigns , and have played at least 35 friendly cup matches : in Belgium for the Coupe Vanden <unk> , and in the Netherlands for the <unk> Nieuwsblad @-@ <unk> . The overall balance favours the Netherlands , with 55 wins against 41 Belgian victories . The Low Countries ' squads co @-@ operated in fundraising initiatives between 1925 and 1941 ; they played five unofficial games for charity , FIFA and the Belgian Olympic Committee . 
 The first match between Belgium and France , the <unk> Coppée Trophy played in 1904 , was the first official game for both teams and the first official football match between independent countries on the European continent . Until 1967 , the sides met almost annually . As of May 2016 , France has played most often against Belgium in international football . Belgium have the better record , with 30 wins to France 's 24 . 
 = = Management = = 
 Since 1904 , the RBFA , 23 permanent managers and two caretaker managers have officially been in charge of the national team ; this includes one national footballer selector . As of 15 July 2016 , a crew of over 20 RBFA employees guides the player group ; it has no head coach after the dismissal of Marc Wilmots . As of 15 July 2016 , Wilmots is statistically the best performing Belgium manager with an average of 2 @.@ 18 points per match . These results led to Belgium 's top FIFA ranking spot in 2015 , and earned him the title of Best Coach of the Year at the 2015 Globe Soccer Awards . Under Guy Thys , the squad achieved record results at World and European championships ; World Soccer magazine accordingly proclaimed him Manager of the Year in 1986 . 
 Rather than developing innovative team formations or styles of play , Belgium 's managers applied conventional tactics . At the three 1930s World Cups , the Red Devils were aligned in a contemporary 2 – 3 – 5 " pyramid " . In 1954 , Doug Livingstone 's squad played in a 3 – 2 – 5 " WM " arrangement during World Cup matches . Throughout most of their tournament games in the 1970s , the 1980s and the 1990s , the team played in a 4 – 4 – 2 formation . Since Raymond Goethals ' leadership in the 1970s , a key strength of the Belgian squad has been their systematic use of the offside trap , a defensive tactic that was already intensively applied in the 1960s by Anderlecht coach Pierre <unk> . According to football journalist Wim De Bock , " master tactician " Goethals represented the " conservative , defensive football of the Belgian national team " ; he added that in the 1970s , the contrast between the Belgian playing style and the Total Football of their Dutch rivals " could not be bigger " . 
 In an attempt to win a game at the 1998 World Cup , Georges Leekens chose a 4 – 3 – 3 arrangement for Belgium 's second and third group matches . Robert Waseige , Belgium coach around 2000 , said that " above all , [ his ] 4 – 4 – 2 system [ was ] holy " , in the sense that he left good attackers on the bench to keep his favourite formation . Wilmots opted for the 4 – 3 – 3 line @-@ up again , with the intention of showing dominant football against any country .

 Between 1904 and 1980 , mainly attacking Belgium players were recognised as talented footballers . In the team 's first decade , striker Robert De Veen was very productive with 26 goals in 23 international appearances . Richard Henshaw described Alphonse Six as " Belgium 's greatest player in the prewar period ... [ who ] was often called the most skillful forward outside Great Britain " . The key player of the victorious 1920 Olympic squad was Robert Coppée , who scored a hat @-@ trick against Spain 's Ricardo Zamora , and the penalty in the final . Other outstanding Belgian strikers in the interwar period were top scorer Bernard <unk> and " Belgium 's football grandmaster " Raymond Braine , considered " one of the greatest players of the era " . 
 Gifted players in the 1940s and the 1950s included centre @-@ back Louis Carré and attackers Jef <unk> , Pol <unk> and Rik Coppens ; at the 1954 World Cup , <unk> shone with three goals , and newspaper L 'Équipe named Coppens the event 's best centre forward . The 1960s and the early 1970s were the glory days of forward and four @-@ time Belgian Golden Shoe Paul Van Himst , later elected Belgian UEFA Golden Player of 1954 – 2003 and Belgium 's Player of the Century by IFFHS . At the 1965 Ballon d 'Or , Van Himst ranked fourth , achieving Belgium 's highest ever position at the European football election . Decades after Coppens and Van Himst had retired from playing football , a journalist on a Flemish television show asked them " Who [ from both of you ] was the best , actually ? " . Coppens replied : " I will ask Paul that ... If Paul says it was me , then he 's right " . In 1966 , striker Raoul Lambert and defending midfielder Wilfried Van <unk> joined the national team ; while the UEFA praised Lambert for his skills at Euro 1972 , Van <unk> won three Golden Shoes and equalled Van Himst 's fourth rank at the Ballon d 'Or in 1980 . 
 Belgium has seen two talented waves since 1980 , from which several players in defensive positions gained international fame . In the 1980s and the early 1990s , goalkeepers Jean @-@ Marie Pfaff and Michel Preud 'homme were elected best custodians at FIFA World Cups , while FIFA recognised midfielders Jan Ceulemans and Enzo Scifo as the propelling forces of Belgium 's 1986 FIFA World Cup squad . In 2002 , after all players of this generation had retired , Marc Wilmots became Belgium 's top scorer at the World Cup with five goals . 
 During the 12 years in which Belgium failed to qualify for major tournaments , another golden generation matured , most of whom later featured in foreign top football leagues ; as of July 2013 , 12 Belgian national team players would play the next season in the English Premier League . Five players of this generation gained both prime individual and team awards in foreign top competitions or European club competitions : defenders Vincent Kompany and Jan Vertonghen , wingers Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne , and forward Kevin <unk> . However , as of July 2016 none of them were regarded by FIFA or UEFA to be the best at their position in any major international tournament yet .

 Belgium failed to progress past the first round of their earliest five World Cup participations . After two scoreless defeats at the inaugural World Cup in 1930 , the team scored in their first @-@ round knockout games in the 1934 and 1938 editions — but only enough to save their honour . In 1954 , they tied with England ( 4 – 4 after extra time ) , and in 1970 , they won their first World Cup match against El Salvador ( 3 – 0 ) . From 1982 until 2002 , Belgium reached six successive World Cups by playing qualification rounds , advancing to the second phase five times . In the 1982 FIFA World Cup opener , Belgium beat defending champions Argentina 1 – 0 . Their tournament ended in the second group stage , after a Polish hat @-@ trick by Zbigniew Boniek and a 0 – 1 loss against the Soviet Union . 
 At Mexico 1986 , the Belgian team achieved their best @-@ ever World Cup run . In the knockout phase as underdogs they beat the Soviets after extra time ( 3 – 4 ) ; the unnoticed offside position of Jan Ceulemans , during the initial ninety minutes , allowed him to equalise ( 2 – 2 ) and force the game into extra time . They also beat Spain , in a penalty shoot @-@ out after a 1 – 1 draw , but lost to eventual champions Argentina in the semi @-@ final 2 – 0 , and France in the third @-@ place match ( 4 – 2 ) . In the 1990 FIFA World Cup , Belgium dominated periods of their second @-@ round match against England ; Enzo Scifo and Jan Ceulemans hit the woodwork . David Platt 's volley in the final minute of extra time , described as " nearly blind " by Richard Witzig , avoided an apparently goalless draw and led to the sudden elimination of the Belgians . 
 In 1994 , a 3 – 2 defeat to defending champions Germany saw Belgium go out in the second round again . Afterwards , the entire Belgian delegation criticised referee Kurt <unk> for not awarding a penalty for a foul on Belgian Josip Weber . Three draws in the group stage of the 1998 World Cup were insufficient for Belgium to reach the knockout stage . With two draws , the 2002 FIFA World Cup started poorly for Belgium , but they won the decisive group match against Russia 3 – 2 . In the second round , they faced eventual World Cup winners Brazil ; Belgium lost 2 – 0 after Marc Wilmots ' headed opening goal was disallowed due to a " phantom foul " on Roque Júnior , as Richard Witzig named it . 
 In 2014 , Belgium beat all their group opponents with a single @-@ goal difference . Thereafter , they played an entertaining round of 16 game against the United States , in which American goalkeeper Tim Howard made 15 saves . However , they defeated the US 2 – 1 in extra time . In a balanced quarter @-@ final , Argentina eliminated Belgium , after a 1 – 0 victory . 
 = = = UEFA European Championship = = = 
 With four successful qualification campaigns out of thirteen , Belgium 's performance in the European Championship does not compare to their World Cup record . Belgium has hosted or co @-@ hosted the event twice ; they were chosen to accommodate the 1972 European Football Championship from three candidates , and hosted UEFA Euro 2000 with the Netherlands . 
 At Euro 1972 , Belgium finished third after losing 1 – 2 against West Germany and beating Hungary 2 – 1 . The team 's best continental result is their second place at Euro 1980 in Italy . By finishing as group winners , Belgium reached the final , to face West Germany . The West German Horst <unk> scored first , but René Vandereycken equalised courtesy of a penalty . Two minutes before the regular playing time ended , <unk> scored again denying Belgium a first European title . 
 At Euro 1984 , in their last and decisive group match against Denmark , the Belgian team took a 0 – 2 lead , but the Danes won the match 3 – 2 . Sixteen years later , Belgium automatically reappeared at UEFA 's national team tournament as co @-@ hosts . After winning the Euro 2000 opener against Sweden 2 – 1 , two 2 – 0 losses against eventual runners @-@ up Italy and Turkey eliminated the Belgians from the tournament by the end of the group stage . 
 In spite of winning with broad margins against the Republic of Ireland ( 3 – 0 ) and Hungary ( 0 – 4 ) at Euro 2016 , Belgium 's second very talented generation disappointed with a quarter @-@ final exit . As during the tournament 's qualifiers , Wales got the better of Belgium , with a 3 – 1 win . 
 = = = Summer Olympic Games = = = 
 Football tournaments for senior men 's national teams took place in six Summer Olympics between 1908 and 1936 . The Belgian squad participated in all three Olympic football tournaments in the 1920s and won the gold medal on home soil at the 1920 edition . Apart from the proper national team , two other Belgian delegations appeared at the Olympics . At the 1900 Summer Olympics , a Belgian representation with mainly students won bronze , and at the 2008 edition , Belgium 's U @-@ 23 selection placed fourth . 
 Belgium 's 1920 Olympic squad was given a bye into the quarter @-@ finals , where they won 3 – 1 against Spain , and reached the semi @-@ finals , where they beat the Netherlands 3 – 0 . In the first half of their final against Czechoslovakia , the Belgians led 2 – 0 . Forward Robert Coppée converted a disputed early penalty , and the action in which attacker Henri <unk> doubled the score was also a matter of debate . After the dismissal of the Czechoslovak left @-@ back Karel Steiner , the discontented visitors left the pitch in the 40th minute . Afterwards , the away team reported their reasons for protest to the Olympic organisation ; these complaints were dismissed and the Czechoslovaks were disqualified . The 2 – 0 score was allowed to stand and Belgium were crowned the champions .

 SM U @-@ 16 or U @-@ XVI was a U @-@ 10 @-@ class submarine or U @-@ boat of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ( German : Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine or <unk> K. Kriegsmarine ) during World War I. U @-@ 16 was constructed in Germany and shipped by rail to Pula where she was assembled and completed in September 1915 . She was commissioned in October 1915 . 
 For most of her career , U @-@ 16 operated in the Adriatic out of Kotor patrolling off the Albanian coast . The U @-@ boat sank one small sailing ship in November and seized another in December . U @-@ 16 carried Field Marshal Svetozar Borojević of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Army as an observer while performing diving tests after engine repairs in January 1916 . A water leak in March flooded U @-@ 16 's batteries and put the U @-@ boat out of action for about six weeks of repairs . While operating off Vlorë in mid @-@ October 1916 , U @-@ 16 sank an Italian destroyer acting as a convoy escort . U @-@ 16 was sunk in the ensuing action , but sources are not clear on the exact cause of her sinking . In all U @-@ 16 sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 711 . She was the only U @-@ 10 @-@ class submarine sunk during the war . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 U @-@ 16 was a small , coastal submarine that displaced 125 @.@ 5 long tons ( 127 @.@ 5 t ) surfaced and 140 @.@ 25 long tons ( 142 @.@ 50 t ) submerged . She featured a single shaft , a single 60 bhp ( 45 kW ) Daimler diesel engine for surface running , and a single 120 shp ( 89 kW ) electric motor for submerged travel . U @-@ 16 was capable of up to 6 @.@ 5 knots ( 12 @.@ 0 km / h ; 7 @.@ 5 mph ) while surfaced and 5 @.@ 5 knots ( 10 @.@ 2 km / h ; 6 @.@ 3 mph ) while submerged at a diving depth of up to 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . She was designed for a crew of 17 officers and men . 
 U @-@ 16 was equipped with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes . Although most members of the class were outfitted with a 37 mm / 23 ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) gun to supplement their armament in October 1916 , it is not known whether this upgrade had yet taken place on U @-@ 16 by the time of her sinking during that month . 
 U @-@ 16 was ordered by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 1 April 1915 and laid down at AG Weser in Bremen on later in the month . When completed , the submarine was broken down into sections , loaded onto railcars , and shipped on 20 August to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy 's main base at Pula . After completing the eight @-@ day journey , the sections were riveted together . Though there is no specific mention of how long it took for U @-@ 16 's sections to be assembled , a sister boat , the German Type UB I submarine UB @-@ 3 , shipped to Pula from Germany in mid @-@ April 1915 , was assembled in about two weeks . U @-@ 16 was delivered to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 29 September . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 SM U @-@ 16 was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 6 October under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Eugen <unk> Edler von Horn . Over the next month U @-@ 16 patrolled off Rimini and the Po estuary before heading to Kotor . There , U @-@ 16 's second commander , Linienschiffsleutnant Orest Ritter von Zopa , assumed command on 18 November . The U @-@ boat departed the next day to patrol off Albania . Near Cape <unk> , von Zopa stopped and boarded Fiore Albania , an Albanian sailing ship . Finding nothing amiss , the commander sent Fiore Albania on her way . Three days later , von Zopa and U @-@ 16 scored their first success , when they sank the 25 GRT Italian sailing vessel Unione in the Gulf of Drin . Later the same day , a torpedo attack on two cargo ships in the harbor at <unk> netted no results . With her supply of torpedoes expended , U @-@ 16 returned to Kotor on 24 November . 
 U @-@ 16 set out on her next patrol on 3 December , but had to return to fix a broken gyrocompass , and was underway for Albania the next day . On 5 December , the sailboat <unk> was stopped , searched , and allowed to proceed . Near the same location , U @-@ 16 next encountered <unk> Albania again . When stopped this time , the 62 @-@ ton ship had Montenegrin soldiers , weapons , and ammunition aboard . The vessel was seized as a prize and taken back to Kotor . U @-@ 16 attempted two more Albanian patrols at the end of December . The first , departing Kotor on 19 December , was cut short by severe weather that forced the submarine back to port . The next attempt , on 25 December , ended when U @-@ 16 suffered engine problems . U @-@ 16 sailed for Pula on 27 December for more extensive engine repairs at the naval base there . 
 U @-@ 16 's repairs were complete by 9 January 1916 when the submarine departed Pula for diving tests with Field Marshal Svetozar Borojević of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Army on board as an observer . With the tests apparently successful , U @-@ 16 returned to Kotor on 18 January to resume Albanian patrols . Off Durrës on 4 February , von Zopa and U @-@ 16 launched a torpedo attack on the steamer Assyria being escorted by the Italian destroyers <unk> and Garibaldino . The torpedo 's aim was true , but it failed to detonate when it hit the ship . A few days later , a British Falmouth @-@ class cruiser attacked the U @-@ boat . On 11 March , a valve on U @-@ 16 leaked and water flooded into the boat , inundating the batteries , which released chlorine gas . The U @-@ boat made it back to Kotor and underwent repairs that kept the boat out of action until the end of April . 
 From late April to early September , U @-@ 16 patrolled the Adriatic between Vlorë , Brindisi , and the Straits of Otranto . Twice during this time U @-@ 16 attacked French destroyers , but missed on both attempts . In mid June , von Zopa launched torpedoes against a cargo ship without result . U @-@ 16 put in at Kotor on 3 September for a general overhaul that lasted for about a month . When the repairs were complete , U @-@ 16 set out for another Albanian patrol on 9 October . The submarine made a detour to <unk> on 11 October to replace another faulty gyrocompass , but quickly resumed her journey to the Vlorë area . After discovering an Italian convoy on 17 October , von Zopa torpedoed and sank one of the convoy escorts , the Italian destroyer Nembo . In the ensuing action , U @-@ 16 was sunk , but sources disagree on the exact manner . 
 Conway 's All the World 's Fighting Ships , 1906 – 1921 reports that the Italian steamer Bormida , one of the convoyed ships , rammed and damaged U @-@ 16 , causing U @-@ 16 's crew to scuttle their ship due to the severity of the damage . Uboat.net 's U @-@ Boat War in World War I reports that Nembo herself rammed U @-@ 16 before going down , while Robert Grant and Gordon Smith give another possible fate for U @-@ 16 : that Nembo 's depth charges detonated and sank the submarine while Nembo was sinking . Smith reports that 11 men aboard U @-@ 16 , including her commanding officer von Zopa , lost their lives in the sinking , and that two survivors were picked up . U @-@ 16 was the only boat of her class to be sunk during the war .

 = 1942 Matagorda hurricane = 
 The 1942 Matagorda hurricane was the most intense and costliest tropical cyclone of the 1942 Atlantic hurricane season . The second tropical storm and hurricane , as well as the first major hurricane of the year , it originated from a tropical wave near the island of St. Lucia on August 21 . Moving generally westward across the Caribbean Sea , the storm remained weak for much of its early existence . However , it gradually intensified , and reach hurricane strength south of Jamaica on August 25 before coming ashore the Yucatán Peninsula late on August 27 . Once in the Gulf of Mexico , the hurricane quickly strengthened , and attained its peak intensity on August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . However , nearing the Texas Gulf Coast , the storm waned in intensity , and was only a Category 1 hurricane by the time it made a final landfall near Matagorda , Texas on August 30 . Continuing inland , the hurricane weakened , and dissipated into a remnant low on August 31 . 
 At the hurricane 's first landfall near the northeastern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula , little information was documented on the storm 's impacts . However , as the storm approached the Texas coast , widespread evacuations took place , including the evacuation of roughly 50 @,@ 000 people from Galveston , Texas alone . Upon making landfall , the hurricane caused extensive damage in coastal regions . In Matagorda , storm surge peaking at 14 @.@ 7 ft ( 4 @.@ 5 m ) inundated the city and damaged many others . Strong winds from the storm wreaked havoc as far inland as San Antonio , Texas . The winds leveled numerous buildings and uprooted trees , in addition to causing widespread power outages . Crops in the areas affected saw large losses , particularly the rice crop . Rainfall associated with the storm was relatively light , due to the hurricane 's rapid forward motion once inland , peaking at 9 @.@ 3 in ( 0 @.@ 24 m ) in Woodsboro , Texas . Overall , the storm caused $ 26 @.@ 5 million in damages and eight deaths . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave was first noted near St. Lucia at 0600 UTC on August 21 , associated with squally weather , though there were little signs of any organization . However , in HURDAT – the official database of positions and intensities of Atlantic hurricanes dating back to 1851 – the system is listed to have already organized into a tropical storm at the same time . Nonetheless , development was slow throughout its early existence as it moved quickly eastward across the Caribbean Sea . Forward motion slowed as the storm progressed westward south of Jamaica on August 25 . Though signs of development were first noted at around this time , later reanalysis was conducted on the system , revealing that it had already strengthened to the equivalent of a modern @-@ day Category 1 hurricane . Shortly after , observations indicated that the hurricane was rapidly intensifying . Passing well north of the Swan Islands , the storm attained Category 2 intensity at 0600 UTC on August 26 . Shortly after , the hurricane made its first landfall at a similar intensity on the northeastern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula late on August 27 . 
 Once in the Gulf of Mexico on August 28 , the hurricane moved northwest on a nearly linear path towards the Texas coast as it steadily intensified . By 0600 UTC on August 29 , the storm reached Category 3 intensity with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) – this would be the storm 's maximum intensity . However , the hurricane weakened back down to Category 1 strength before making landfall just after midnight on August 30 near Matagorda and Palacios , Texas . At the time , the storm had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , with hurricane @-@ force winds extending out 150 mi ( 240 km ) from the storm 's center of circulation . The hurricane 's minimum central pressure at landfall was estimated at 950 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 06 inHg ) , though a pressure reading of 952 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 16 inHg ) in Seadrift , Texas marked the lowest recorded pressure . Once inland , the storm quickly weakened , and degenerated to tropical storm strength at 1200 UTC on August 30 while located near Hallettsville , Texas . Weakening to a tropical depression the following day , it dissipated at 1200 UTC on August 30 near Sweetwater , Texas . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Despite making landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula on August 27 as a Category 2 hurricane , no damage was reported there . As the storm traversed the Gulf of Mexico towards the Texas Gulf Coast , evacuation procedures were conducted across the region . In the storm @-@ warning area of Galveston , Texas , roughly 50 @,@ 000 people evacuated inland ; the high number of evacuees was likely due in part to another hurricane which struck the coast a week prior . Camp Hulen , located near Palacios , Texas , was also evacuated . Other coastal locations were evacuated via trucks , buses , and trains with the guidance of warnings published by the United States Weather Bureau . Schools in the region were prepared as emergency shelters in advance of the storm 's landfall . 
 Upon making landfall near Palacios , Texas early on August 30 , considerable damage was wrought to an extensive area of the state . At the coast , the hurricane produced a strong storm surge , mostly in the storm 's eastern hemisphere . Storm tides were reported across the Texas coast up to southwestern Louisiana . A station in Matagorda , Texas recorded a storm tide 14 @.@ 7 ft ( 4 @.@ 48 m ) above average . At the time , this was the third highest storm surge ever measured in Texas , behind peak observations taken during the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane and the 1900 Galveston hurricane . The unusually strong tide inundated Matagorda under 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) of seawater . The accumulation of the hurricane 's affects resulted in the destruction of nearly every building in the city . Due to debris and other sediments scattered by the strong waves , the reach of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in both the Matagorda and San Antonio Bays decreased by 540 ft2 ( 50 m2 ) . Further north in Freeport , Texas , the storm surge reached 11 @.@ 8 ft ( 3 @.@ 6 m ) above normal . The strong wave action reopened two inlets near Corpus Christi Pass , and also destroyed two cottages on North Beach . In Harris County , Texas , located near the northern edge of the storm , crops sustained heavy damages , and losses to the rice crop alone amounted to $ 600 @,@ 000 . 
 The hurricane also brought strong winds which caused considerable damage as far inland as San Antonio , Texas , 120 mi ( 195 km ) from the coast . In Seadrift , Texas , where the storm 's lowest pressure reading of 952 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 16 inHg ) was recorded , winds were estimated to have reached 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . The Halfmoon Reef Lighthouse , then situated offshore in Matagorda Bay , was knocked off its pilings due to the strong winds . As such , the United States Coast Guard decided to sell the lighthouse to a private owner . The lighthouse was later repositioned on land . In Matagorda and Palacios , winds of at least 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) lasted roughly three hours , leveling several buildings . Later reports from Palacios indicated that the storm was the worst there since the 1900 Galveston hurricane . Due to the storm 's fast motion before and after landfall , hurricane @-@ force winds were felt as far inland as Atascosa County , Texas . In Corpus Christi , Texas , a peak wind gust of 72 mph ( 116 km / h ) was reported . There , damage was limited to oil derricks and other light structures . Communications from the city to Port Aransas , Texas . The county sheriff of Victoria County , Texas reported that every house was " damaged to some extent . " In Cuero , Texas , strong winds caused severe infrastructural and crop damage . 
 Precipitation associated with the storm was generally light due to the hurricane 's rapid forward motion . Moderate to heavy rainfall was of local extent and covered a limited area of South Texas , peaking at 9 @.@ 3 in ( 240 mm ) in Woodsboro , Texas . Contrary to typical rapidly moving tropical cyclones , much of the storm 's rainfall fell to the west and south of the storm throughout its duration , which up to that point was a phenomenon rarely observed . The peak rainfall measurement in Woodsboro was located 25 mi ( 40 km ) away from the center of the hurricane . Throughout Atascosa County , at least 4 in ( 100 mm ) of rain fell . 
 After making landfall , the hurricane 's fast speed enabled it to still bring strong winds and impacts well inland . In South @-@ Central Texas , the tropical cyclone was considered the worst of the entire 20th century . On August 30 , despite being situated over the Austin and San Antonio metropolitan areas , the storm still retained maximum sustained winds of at least 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . In Floresville , Texas , the winds damaged numerous buildings . Similar effects occurred in Atascosa County and Seguin , Texas , where trees were uprooted and additional buildings were damaged . In Seguin , the passing storm was considered the worst since the 1886 Indianola hurricane , which also moved rapidly inland . In New Braunfels , Texas , damage was confined to trees , while in Austin , Texas power lines were downed by the strong winds . San Antonio saw the brunt of the storm 's impacts in South @-@ Central Texas . Gusts reaching as high as 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) battered the city for at least five hours , causing extensive damage to infrastructure , as well as causing numerous power outages . Hundreds of trees were uprooted , and the resulting damage was considered the worst since 1899 . Despite being held to the ground by 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) stakes , the strong winds still managed to damage 70 of the 75 planes at Alamo Field . Total estimated damages in the city amounted to $ 300 @,@ 000 . 
 Overall , the hurricane caused $ 26 @.@ 5 million in damages , with $ 11 @.@ 5 million to property and $ 15 million to crops , with the storm 's damage in Texas spread across twelve counties . This would make the storm the most costly of the hurricane season . Despite the hurricane 's wide swath of damage and strong intensity , only eight people were killed . The low number of fatalities is attributable to the extensive evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm , as well as warnings provided by the Weather Bureau . 
 = California State Route 20 = 
 State Route 20 ( SR 20 ) is a state highway in the northern central region of the U.S. state of California , running east – west across the state north of Sacramento . Its west end is at SR 1 in Fort Bragg , from where it heads east past Clear Lake , Colusa , Yuba City , Marysville , and Nevada City to I @-@ 80 near Emigrant Gap , where eastbound traffic can continue on other routes to Lake Tahoe or Nevada . 
 Portions of SR 20 are built near the routing of what was first a wagon road and later a turnpike in the late nineteenth century . This road was extended through the state highway system all the way to Ukiah in the early twentieth century , and the missing link near Clear Lake was completed in 1932 before the official designation of this highway as SR 20 in 1934 . There have been subsequent improvements to the road , such as the conversion of the Grass Valley portion of the route to freeway standards .

 State Route 20 east of US 101 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System , although it is mostly a two @-@ lane surface road . All of SR 20 is on the Interregional Road System , a highway system that connects major economic centers of the state , and has been selected by the California Department of Transportation ( Caltrans ) as a High Emphasis Route and Focus Route from US 101 to SR 29 and SR 53 to I @-@ 80 , with the designated corridor following SR 29 and SR 53 around the south side of Clear Lake . It is also eligible for the State Scenic Highway System from SR 1 to SR 16 and SR 49 to I @-@ 80 , and has been designated as such for 6 miles ( 10 km ) near the east end ; this is part of the federally designated Yuba @-@ Donner Scenic Byway , a National Scenic Byway that uses SR 20 east of SR 49 . 
 State Route 20 begins at SR 1 in southern Fort Bragg , under a mile ( 1 / 2 km ) from the Pacific Ocean . It heads east , quickly climbing into the Mendocino Range along a ridge and crossing through Dunlap Pass . The highway continues to rise alongside the North Fork Big River and tributaries , crossing another summit and then descending to Willits in the Little Lake Valley via <unk> Creek . An overlap with US 101 begins in Willits and heads southeasterly to <unk> , north of Ukiah in Redwood Valley . There SR 20 turns east again , crossing the Russian River , passing the north shore of Lake Mendocino , and rising to a summit via the East Fork Russian River and Cold Creek . The roadway again descends alongside the Blue Lakes and Scotts Creek to the junction with SR 29 and the settlement of Upper Lake in the Clear Lake Basin . SR 20 closely follows the northeast shore of Clear Lake , staying right above the water line to avoid the adjacent hills . Where the lake ends , SR 20 continues east , intersecting SR 53 and then following the North Fork Cache Creek and tributaries to the Lake @-@ Colusa County line . During its final descent into the Sacramento Valley , SR 20 intersects SR 16 and curves north and back east , entering the valley via Salt Creek . 
 Once it enters the flat Sacramento Valley , SR 20 takes a generally straight path , crossing I @-@ 5 in Williams , overlapping SR 45 near the west bank of the Sacramento River southeast from Colusa , and then turning back east to cross the Sacramento River and Sutter Bypass on its way to Yuba City . The route crosses SR 99 west of central Yuba City , and runs east through northern Yuba City to the Feather River , which it crosses on the 10th Street Bridge into Marysville . Within the central part of that city , SR 20 makes several turns , first turning south from 10th Street onto E Street , then east on 9th Street ( overlapping SR 70 ) , north on B Street , and east on 12th Street ( splitting from SR 70 ) . The highway leaves Marysville to the northeast , paralleling the Yuba River on its north side as it enters the foothills of the Sierra Nevada . 
 SR 20 rises into the Sierras along the north side of the Yuba River , crossing to the south side near <unk> and then climbing through several ravines to the Penn Valley . The current alignment , built in the mid @-@ 1980s as a mostly two @-@ lane freeway , continues east across rugged terrain to the city of Grass Valley , where it joins SR 49 on the Golden Center Freeway . The two routes travel northeast to Nevada City , where SR 49 turns northwest and SR 20 resumes its eastward course as a two @-@ lane highway . The roadway climbs from Nevada City and follows Harmony Ridge and Washington Ridge before descending into the Bear Valley via a series of hairpin turns , and then climbing , just north of Emigrant Gap , to its end at I @-@ 80 at Yuba Pass . The Pioneer Trail , a National Recreation Trail , parallels SR 20 from a point on Harmony Ridge to the Bear Valley , and includes parts of a branch of the California Trail first used in 1850 . 
 = = History = = 
 The east end of SR 20 , from Bear Valley ( just below Emigrant Gap ) to Nevada City , closely follows a branch of the Truckee Route of the California Trail , first used by California @-@ bound emigrants in 1850 . Later a turnpike was built here by the same company that opened the Pacific Turnpike ( Culbertson Road and Bowman Lake Road between Dutch Flat and Bowman Lake ) in 1864 . 
 By the end of the 1910s , a passable dirt and gravel road connected Ukiah and Nevada City via the south side of Clear Lake and Marysville . The portion between Lower Lake and Wilbur Springs was impassable in wet weather , at which times the Bartlett Springs and Bear Valley Toll @-@ road via Upper Lake and Bartlett Springs was available for $ 1 @.@ 50 each way or $ 2 @.@ 50 round trip . This route generally followed the present SR 20 , except around Clear Lake and between Marysville and Rough and Ready ( where it used <unk> Road ) . Beyond Nevada City to Emigrant Gap , the old turnpike was not passable ; instead the present SR 174 was available for eastward drivers . Between Williams and Colusa , the road was paved in concrete , as it had been added to the state highway system as part of the first ( 1910 ) bond issue , specifically as Route 15 , connecting the west Sacramento Valley trunk ( Route 7 , now I @-@ 5 ) with the county seat of Colusa . 
 This state highway was significantly extended in both directions in 1919 , west to Ukiah and east to Emigrant Gap , creating what was known as the Tahoe @-@ Ukiah Highway , connecting Ukiah and Lake Tahoe in combination with Route 37 ( now I @-@ 80 ) and Route 38 ( now SR 89 ) . The law that defined the extension simply stated that it would connect " Ukiah to Tahoe City " ; the state decided in September 1925 that it would run the highway along the north shore of Clear Lake , combining with the planned Rumsey @-@ Lower Lake Highway ( Route 50 , now SR 53 and SR 16 ) east to Wilbur Springs . With the completion of this segment in mid @-@ 1932 , the highway was ready for heavy travel , and became Sign Route 20 in 1934 as part of the initial signed state route system . 
 In 1953 , the legislature added an extension of Route 15 from US 101 at Willits ( north of Ukiah ) west to SR 1 near Fort Bragg . This was constructed ( over an existing county road ) and became part of Sign Route 20 prior to 1964 , when the Route 20 designation was legislatively adopted . Subsequent improvements include the construction of the Golden Center Freeway , connecting Grass Valley with Nevada City , in the late 1960s , and a new alignment of SR 20 west from Grass Valley , bypassing Rough and Ready , in the mid @-@ 1980s .

 Alexander Aleksandrovich Alekhine ( Russian : Алекса ́ ндр Алекса ́ ндрович <unk> ́ <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; October 31 [ O.S. October 19 ] 1892 – March 24 , 1946 ) was a Russian and French chess player and the fourth World Chess Champion . He is widely considered one of the greatest chess players ever . 
 By the age of 22 , Alekhine was already among the strongest chess players in the world . During the 1920s , he won most of the tournaments in which he played . In 1921 , Alekhine left Soviet Russia and emigrated to France , which he represented after 1925 . In 1927 , he became the fourth World Chess Champion by defeating José Raúl Capablanca . 
 In the early 1930s , Alekhine dominated tournament play and won two top @-@ class tournaments by large margins . He also played first board for France in five Chess Olympiads , winning individual prizes in each ( four medals and a brilliancy prize ) . Alekhine offered Capablanca a rematch on the same demanding terms that Capablanca had set for him , and negotiations dragged on for years without making much progress . Meanwhile , Alekhine defended his title with ease against Efim Bogoljubov in 1929 and 1934 . He was defeated by Max Euwe in 1935 , but regained his crown in the 1937 rematch . His tournament record , however , remained uneven , and rising young stars like Paul Keres , Reuben Fine , and Mikhail Botvinnik threatened his title . Negotiations for a title match with Keres or Botvinnik were halted by the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939 . Negotiations with Botvinnik for a world title match were proceeding in 1946 when Alekhine died in Portugal , in unclear circumstances . Alekhine is the only World Chess Champion to die while holding the title . 
 Alekhine is known for his fierce and imaginative attacking style , combined with great positional and endgame skill . He is highly regarded as a chess writer and theoretician , producing innovations in a wide range of chess openings and giving his name to Alekhine 's Defence and several other opening variations . He also composed some endgame studies . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Alekhine was born into a wealthy family in Moscow , Russia , on October 31 , 1892 . His father , Alexander Ivanovich <unk> , was a landowner and Privy Councilor to the conservative legislative Fourth Duma . His mother , <unk> Ivanovna <unk> ( born <unk> ) , was the daughter of a rich industrialist . Alekhine was first introduced to chess by his mother , an older brother , Alexei , and an older sister , Varvara ( Barbara ) . 
 = = = Early chess career ( 1902 – 14 ) = = = 
 Alekhine 's first known game was from a correspondence chess tournament that began on December 3 , 1902 , when he was ten years old . He participated in several correspondence tournaments , sponsored by the chess magazine <unk> <unk> ( " Chess Review " ) , in 1902 – 11 . In 1907 , Alekhine played his first over @-@ the @-@ board tournament , the Moscow chess club 's Spring Tournament . Later that year , he tied for 11th – 13th in the club 's Autumn Tournament ; his older brother , Alexei , tied for 4th – 6th place . In 1908 , Alexander won the club 's Spring Tournament , at the age of 15 . In 1909 , he won the All @-@ Russian Amateur Tournament in Saint Petersburg . For the next few years , he played in increasingly stronger tournaments , some of them outside Russia . At first he had mixed results , but by the age of 16 he had established himself as one of Russia 's top players . He played first board in two friendly team matches : St. Petersburg Chess Club vs. Moscow Chess Club in 1911 and Moscow vs. St. Petersburg in 1912 ( both drew with Yevgeny <unk> @-@ <unk> ) . By the end of 1911 , Alekhine moved to St. Petersburg , where he entered the Imperial Law School for Nobles . By 1912 , he was the strongest chess player in the St. Petersburg Chess Society . In March 1912 , he won the St. Petersburg Chess Club Winter Tournament . In April 1912 , he won the 1st Category Tournament of the St. Petersburg Chess Club . In January 1914 , Alekhine won his first major Russian tournament , when he tied for first place with Aron Nimzowitsch in the All @-@ Russian Masters Tournament at St. Petersburg . Afterwards , they drew in a mini @-@ match for first prize ( each won a game ) . Alekhine also played several matches in this period , and his results showed the same pattern : mixed at first but later consistently good . 
 = = = Top @-@ level grandmaster ( 1914 – 27 ) = = = 
 In April – May 1914 , another major St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament was held in the capital of the Russian Empire , in which Alekhine took third place behind Emanuel Lasker and José Raúl Capablanca . By some accounts , Tsar Nicholas II conferred the title of " Grandmaster of Chess " on each of the five finalists ( Lasker , Capablanca , Alekhine , Siegbert Tarrasch , and Frank Marshall ) . ( Chess historian Edward Winter has questioned this , stating that the earliest known sources supporting this story are an article by Robert Lewis Taylor in the June 15 , 1940 issue of The New Yorker and Marshall 's autobiography My 50 Years of Chess ( 1942 ) . ) Alekhine 's surprising success made him a serious contender for the World Chess Championship . Whether or not the title was formally awarded to him , " Thanks to this performance , Alekhine became a grandmaster in his own right and in the eyes of the audience . " In July 1914 , Alekhine tied for first with Marshall in Paris . 
 = = = = World War I and post @-@ revolutionary Russia = = = = 
 In July – August 1914 , Alekhine was leading an international Mannheim tournament , the 19th DSB Congress ( German Chess Federation Congress ) in Mannheim , Germany , with nine wins , one draw and one loss , when World War I broke out . Alekhine 's prize was 1 @,@ 100 marks ( worth about 11 @,@ 000 euros in terms of purchasing power today ) . After the declaration of war against Russia , eleven " Russian " players ( Alekhine , Efim Bogoljubov , Fedor <unk> , Alexander <unk> , N. Koppelman , Boris <unk> , Ilya Rabinovich , Peter Romanovsky , Pyotr <unk> , Alexey <unk> , and Samuil Weinstein ) were interned in Rastatt , Germany . On September 14 , 17 , and 29 , 1914 , four of them ( Alekhine , <unk> , <unk> , and Koppelman ) were freed and allowed to return home . Alekhine made his way back to Russia ( via Switzerland , Italy , London , Sweden , and Finland ) by the end of October 1914 . A fifth player , Romanovsky , was released in 1915 , and a sixth , <unk> , was allowed to return to Warsaw in 1916 . 
 When Alekhine returned to Russia , he helped raise money to aid the Russian chess players who remained interned in Germany by giving simultaneous exhibitions . In December 1915 , he won the Moscow Chess Club Championship . In April 1916 , he won a mini @-@ match against Alexander <unk> with two wins and one loss at Kiev , and in summer he served in the Union of Cities ( Red Cross ) on the Austrian front . In September , he played five people in a blindfold display at a Russian military hospital at Tarnopol . In 1918 , he won a " triangular tournament " in Moscow . In June of the following year , after the Russians forced the German army to retreat from Ukraine , Alekhine was charged with links with White counter @-@ intelligence and was briefly imprisoned in Odessa 's death cell by the Odessa Cheka . Rumors appeared in the West that he had been killed by the Bolsheviks . 
 = = = = 1920 – 27 = = = = 
 When conditions in Russia became more settled , Alekhine proved he was among Russia 's strongest players . For example , in January 1920 , he swept the Moscow City Chess Championship ( 11 / 11 ) , but was not declared Moscow Champion because he was not a resident of the city . Also in October 1920 , he won the All @-@ Russian Championship in Moscow ( + 9 − 0 = 6 ) ; this tournament was retroactively defined as the first USSR Championship . His brother Alexei took third place in the tournament for amateurs . 
 In March 1920 , Alekhine married Alexandra <unk> . They divorced the next year . For a short time in 1920 – 21 , he worked as an interpreter for the Communist International ( Comintern ) and was appointed secretary to the Education Department . In this capacity , he met a Swiss journalist and Comintern delegate , Anneliese <unk> , who was thirteen years older than he was , and they married on March 15 , 1921 . Shortly after , Alekhine was given permission to leave Russia for a visit to the West with his wife , from which he never returned . In June 1921 , he abandoned his second wife in Paris and went to Berlin . 
 In 1921 – 23 , Alekhine played seven mini @-@ matches . In 1921 , he won against Nikolay Grigoriev ( + 2 − 0 = 5 ) in Moscow , drew with Richard Teichmann ( + 2 − 2 = 2 ) and won against Friedrich Sämisch ( + 2 − 0 = 0 ) , both in Berlin . In 1922 , he won against Ossip Bernstein ( + 1 − 0 = 1 ) and Arnold <unk> ( + 1 − 0 = 1 ) , both in Paris , and Manuel Golmayo ( + 1 − 0 = 1 ) in Madrid . In 1923 , he won against André <unk> ( + 2 − 0 = 0 ) in Paris . 
 From 1921 to 1927 , Alekhine won or shared first prize in about two @-@ thirds of the many tournaments in which he played . His least successful efforts were a tie for third place at Vienna 1922 behind Akiba Rubinstein and Richard Réti , and third place at the New York 1924 chess tournament behind ex @-@ champion Emanuel Lasker and world champion José Raúl Capablanca ( but ahead of Frank Marshall , Richard Réti , Géza Maróczy , Efim Bogoljubov , Savielly Tartakower , Frederick Yates , Edward Lasker , and Dawid Janowski ) . Technically , Alekhine 's play was mostly better than his competitors ' — even Capablanca 's — but he lacked confidence when playing his major rivals . 
 Alekhine 's main goal throughout this period was to arrange a match with Capablanca . He thought the greatest obstacle was not Capablanca 's play , but the requirement under the 1922 " London rules " ( at Capablanca 's insistence ) that the challenger raise a purse of US $ 10 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to about $ 391 @,@ 000 in 2006 ) , of which the defending champion would receive over half even if defeated . Alekhine in November 1921 and Rubinstein and Nimzowitsch in 1923 challenged Capablanca , but were unable to raise the $ 10 @,@ 000 . Raising the money was Alekhine 's preliminary objective ; he even went on tour , playing simultaneous exhibitions for modest fees day after day . In New York on April 27 , 1924 , he broke the world record for simultaneous blindfold play when he played twenty @-@ six opponents ( the previous record was twenty @-@ five , set by Gyula Breyer ) , winning sixteen games , losing five , and drawing five after twelve hours of play . He broke his own world record on February 1 , 1925 by playing twenty @-@ eight games blindfold simultaneously in Paris , winning twenty @-@ two , drawing three , and losing three . 
 In 1924 , he applied for the first time for a residence privilege in France and for French citizenship while pursuing his studies in the Sorbonne Faculty of Law to obtain a PhD . Although sources differ about whether he completed his studies there , he was known as " Dr. Alekhine " in the 1930s . His thesis was on the Chinese prison system . " He received a degree in law in Saint Petersburg in 1914 but never practiced . " 
 His French citizenship application was postponed because of his frequent travels abroad to play chess and because he was reported once in April 1922 , shortly after his arrival in France , as a " <unk> charged by the Soviets of a special mission in France " . Later in 1927 , the French Chess Federation asked the Ministry of Justice to intervene in Alekhine 's favor to have him lead the French team in the first Nation tournament to be held in London in July 1927 . Nevertheless , Alekhine had to wait for a new law on naturalization which was published on 10 August 1927 . The decree granting him French citizenship ( among hundreds of other citizens ) was signed on 5 November 1927 and published in the Official Gazette of the French Republic on 14 – 15 November 1927 , while Alekhine was playing Capablanca for the World title in Buenos Aires . 
 In October 1926 , Alekhine won in Buenos Aires . From December 1926 to January 1927 , he beat Max Euwe 5 ½ – 4 ½ in a match . In 1927 , he married his third wife , <unk> Vasiliev ( née <unk> ) , another older woman , the widow of the Russian general V. Vasiliev .

 In 1927 , Alekhine 's challenge to Capablanca was backed by a group of Argentine businessmen and the president of Argentina , who guaranteed the funds , and organized by the Club Argentino de Ajedrez ( Argentine Chess Club ) in Buenos Aires . In the World Chess Championship match played from September to November 1927 at Buenos Aires , Alekhine won the title , scoring + 6 − 3 = 25 . This was the longest formal World Championship match until the contest in 1984 between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov . Alekhine 's victory surprised almost the entire chess world , since he had never previously won a single game from Capablanca . After Capablanca 's death Alekhine expressed surprise at his own victory , since in 1927 he did not think he was superior to Capablanca , and he suggested that Capablanca had been overconfident . Capablanca entered the match with no technical or physical preparation , while Alekhine got himself into good physical condition and had thoroughly studied Capablanca 's play . According to Kasparov , Alekhine 's research uncovered many small inaccuracies , which occurred because Capablanca was unwilling to concentrate intensely . Vladimir Kramnik has commented that this was the first contest in which Capablanca had no easy wins . 
 = = = Rematch offered , never finalized = = = 
 Immediately after winning the match , Alekhine announced that he was willing to give Capablanca a return match , on the same terms that Capablanca had required as champion : the challenger must provide a stake of US $ 10 @,@ 000 , of which more than half would go to the defending champion even if he was defeated . Negotiations dragged on for several years , often breaking down when agreement seemed in sight . Their relationship became bitter , and Alekhine demanded much higher appearance fees for tournaments in which Capablanca also played . The rematch never took place . After Capablanca 's death in 1942 , Alekhine wrote that Capablanca 's demand for a $ 10 @,@ 000 stake had been an attempt to avoid challenges . 
 Grandmaster Robert Byrne wrote that Alekhine consciously sought lesser opponents for his subsequent championship matches , rather than give Capablanca another chance . 
 = = = Defeats <unk> twice in title matches = = = 
 Although he never agreed terms for a rematch against Capablanca , Alekhine played two world title matches with Bogoljubov , an official " Challenger of FIDE " , in 1929 and 1934 , winning handily both times . The first was held at Wiesbaden , Heidelberg , Berlin , The Hague , and Amsterdam from September through November 1929 . Alekhine retained his title , scoring + 11 − 5 = 9 . From April to June 1934 , Alekhine faced Bogoljubov again in a title match held in twelve German cities , defeating him by five games ( + 8 − 3 = 15 ) . In 1929 , Bogoljubov was forty years old and perhaps already past his peak . 
 = = = Anti @-@ Bolshevik statements , controversy = = = 
 After the world championship match , Alekhine returned to Paris and spoke against Bolshevism . Afterwards , Nikolai Krylenko , president of the Soviet Chess Federation , published an official memorandum stating that Alekhine should be regarded as an enemy of the Soviets . The Soviet Chess Federation broke all contact with Alekhine until the end of the 1930s . His older brother Alexei , with whom Alexander Alekhine had had a very close relationship , publicly repudiated him and his anti @-@ Soviet utterances shortly after , but Alexei may have had little choice about this decision . In August 1939 , Alexei was murdered in Russia , probably due to his open support of the Nazis .

 Alexander Alekhine dominated chess into the mid @-@ 1930s . His most famous tournament victories were at the San Remo 1930 chess tournament ( + 13 = 2 , 3 ½ points ahead of Nimzowitsch ) and the Bled 1931 chess tournament ( + 15 = 11 , 5 ½ points ahead of Bogoljubov ) . He won most of his other tournaments outright , shared first place in two , and the first tournament in which he placed lower than first was Hastings 1933 – 34 ( shared second place , ½ point behind Salo Flohr ) . In 1933 , Alekhine also swept an exhibition match against Rafael <unk> in San Juan ( + 4 − 0 = 0 ) , but only managed to draw another match with Ossip Bernstein in Paris ( + 1 − 1 = 2 ) . 
 From 1930 to 1935 , Alekhine played first board for France at four Chess Olympiads , winning the first brilliancy prize at Hamburg in 1930 , gold medals for board one at Prague in 1931 and Folkestone in 1933 , and the silver medal for board one at Warsaw in 1935 . His loss to Latvian master <unk> <unk> at Prague in 1931 was his first loss in a serious chess event since winning the world championship . 
 In the early 1930s , Alekhine travelled the world giving simultaneous exhibitions , including Hawaii , Tokyo , Manila , Singapore , Shanghai , Hong Kong , and the Dutch East Indies . In July 1933 , he played thirty @-@ two people blindfold simultaneously ( a new world record ) in Chicago , winning nineteen , drawing nine and losing four games . 
 In 1934 Alekhine married his fourth wife , Grace Freeman ( née <unk> ) , sixteen years his senior . She was the American @-@ born widow of a British tea @-@ planter in Ceylon , who retained her British citizenship to the end of her life and remained Alekhine 's wife until his death . 
 About 1933 Reuben Fine noticed that Alekhine was drinking increasing amounts of alcohol . Hans Kmoch wrote that Alekhine first drank heavily during the tournament at Bled in 1931 , and drank heavily through the 1934 match with Bogoljubov . 
 = = Loss of the World title ( 1935 – 37 ) = = 
 In 1933 , Alekhine challenged Max Euwe to a championship match . Euwe , in the early 1930s , was regarded as one of three credible challengers ( the others were José Raúl Capablanca and Salo Flohr ) . Euwe accepted the challenge for October 1935 . Earlier that year , Dutch radio sports journalist Han Hollander asked Capablanca for his views on the forthcoming match . In the rare archival film footage where Capablanca and Euwe both speak , Capablanca replies : " Dr. Alekhine 's game is 20 % bluff . Dr. Euwe 's game is clear and straightforward . Dr. Euwe 's game — not so strong as Alekhine 's in some respects — is more evenly balanced . " Then Euwe gives his assessment in Dutch , explaining that his feelings alternated from optimism to pessimism , but in the previous ten years , their score had been evenly matched at 7 – 7 . 
 On October 3 , 1935 the world championship match began in Zandvoort , the Netherlands . Although Alekhine took an early lead , from game thirteen onwards Euwe won twice as many games as Alekhine . The challenger became the new champion on December 15 , 1935 with nine wins , thirteen draws , and eight losses . This was the first world championship match that officially had seconds : Alekhine had the services of Salo Landau , and Euwe had Géza Maróczy . Euwe 's win was a major upset . Kmoch wrote that Alekhine drank no alcohol for the first half the match , but later took a glass before most games . However , Salo Flohr , who also assisted Euwe , thought overconfidence caused more problems than alcohol did for Alekhine in this match , and Alekhine himself had previously said he would win easily . Later World Champions Vasily Smyslov , Boris Spassky , Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov analyzed the match for their own benefit and concluded that Euwe deserved to win and that the standard of play was worthy of a world championship . 
 According to Kmoch , Alekhine abstained from alcohol altogether for five years after the 1935 match . In the eighteen months after losing the title , Alekhine played in ten tournaments , with uneven results : tied for first with Paul Keres at Bad Nauheim in May 1936 ; first place at Dresden in June 1936 ; second to Flohr at Poděbrady in July 1936 ; sixth , behind Capablanca , Mikhail Botvinnik , Reuben Fine , Samuel Reshevsky , and Euwe at Nottingham in August 1936 ; third , behind Euwe and Fine , at Amsterdam in October 1936 ; tied for first with Salo Landau at Amsterdam ( Quadrangular ) , also in October 1936 ; in 1936 / 37 he won at the Hastings New Year tournament , ahead of Fine and Erich <unk> ; first place at Nice ( Quadrangular ) in March 1937 ; third , behind Keres and Fine , at Margate in April 1937 ; tied for fourth with Keres , behind Flohr , Reshevsky and <unk> <unk> , at <unk> in June – July 1937 ; tied for second with <unk> , behind Euwe , at Bad Nauheim ( Quadrangular ) in July 1937 .

 Max Euwe was quick to arrange a return match with Alekhine , something José Raúl Capablanca had been unable to obtain after Alekhine won the world title in 1927 . Alekhine regained the title from Euwe in December 1937 by a large margin ( + 10 − 4 = 11 ) . In this match , held in the Netherlands , Euwe was seconded by Fine , and Alekhine by Erich <unk> . The match was a real contest initially , but Euwe collapsed near the end , losing four of the last five games . Fine attributed the collapse to nervous tension , possibly aggravated by Euwe 's attempts to maintain a calm appearance . Alekhine played no more title matches , and thus held the title until his death . 
 1938 began well for Alekhine , who won the Montevideo 1938 chess tournament at Carrasco ( in March ) and at Margate ( in April ) , and tied for first with Sir George Alan Thomas at Plymouth ( in September ) . In November , however , he only tied for 4th – 6th with Euwe and Samuel Reshevsky , behind Paul Keres , Reuben Fine , and Mikhail Botvinnik , ahead of Capablanca and Flohr , at the AVRO tournament in the Netherlands . This tournament was played in each of several Dutch cities for a few days at a time ; it was therefore perhaps not surprising that rising stars took the first three places , as the older players found the travel very tiring . 
 Immediately after the AVRO tournament , Botvinnik , who had finished in third place , challenged Alekhine to a match for the world championship . They agreed on a prize fund of US $ 10 @,@ 000 with two @-@ thirds going to the winner , and that if the match were to take place in Moscow , Alekhine would be invited at least three months in advance so that he could play in a tournament to get ready for the match . Other details had not been agreed when World War II interrupted negotiations , which the two players resumed after the war . 
 Keres , who had won the AVRO tournament on tiebreak over Fine , also challenged Alekhine to a world championship match . Negotiations were proceeding in 1939 when they were disrupted by World War II . During the war Keres ' home country , Estonia , was invaded first by the USSR , then by Germany , then again by the USSR . At the end of the war , the Soviet government prevented Keres from continuing the negotiations , on the grounds that he had collaborated with the Germans during their occupation of Estonia ( by Soviet standards ) . 
 Alekhine was representing France at first board in the 8th Chess Olympiad at Buenos Aires 1939 when World War II broke out in Europe . The assembly of all team captains , with leading roles played by Alekhine ( France ) , Savielly Tartakower ( Poland ) , and Albert Becker ( Germany ) , plus the president of the Argentine Chess Federation , Augusto de Muro , decided to go on with the Olympiad . 
 Alekhine won the individual silver medal ( nine wins , no losses , seven draws ) , behind Capablanca ( only results from finals A and B — separately for both sections — counted for best individual scores ) . Shortly after the Olympiad , Alekhine swept tournaments in Montevideo ( 7 / 7 ) and Caracas ( 10 / 10 ) . 
 At the end of August 1939 , both Alekhine and Capablanca wrote to Augusto de Muro regarding a possible world championship rematch . Whereas the former spoke of a rematch as a virtual certainty , even stating that the Cuban was remaining in Buenos Aires until it came about , the latter referred at length to the financial burden in the aftermath of the Olympiad . Supported by Latin @-@ American financial pledges , José R. Capablanca challenged Alexander Alekhine to a world title match in November . Tentative plans not , however , actually backed by a deposit of the required purse ( $ 10 @,@ 000 in gold ) , led to a virtual agreement to play at Buenos Aires , Argentina beginning April 14 , 1940 .

 Unlike many participants in the 1939 Chess Olympiad , Alekhine returned to Europe in January 1940 . After a short stay in Portugal , he enlisted in the French army as a sanitation officer . 
 After the fall of France ( June 1940 ) , he fled to Marseille . Alekhine tried to go to America by traveling to Lisbon and applying for an American visa . In October 1940 , he sought permission to enter Cuba , promising to play a match with Capablanca . This request was denied . To protect his wife , Grace Alekhine and her French assets ( a castle at Saint Aubin @-@ le @-@ <unk> , near Dieppe , which the Nazis looted ) , he agreed to cooperate with the Nazis . Alekhine took part in chess tournaments in Munich , Salzburg , Kraków / Warsaw , and Prague , organised by Ehrhardt Post , the chief executive of the Nazi @-@ controlled <unk> <unk> ( " Greater Germany Chess Federation " ) — Keres , Bogoljubov , Gösta Stoltz , and several other strong masters in Nazi @-@ occupied Europe also played in such events . In 1941 , he tied for second @-@ third with Erik Lundin in the Munich 1941 chess tournament ( <unk> in September , won by Stoltz ) , shared first with Paul Felix Schmidt at Kraków / Warsaw ( the 2nd General Government @-@ ch , in October ) and won in Madrid ( in December ) . The following year he won in the Salzburg 1942 chess tournament ( June 1942 ) and in Munich ( September 1942 ; the Nazis named this the <unk> , which means " European Championship " ) . Later in 1942 he won at Warsaw / Lublin / Kraków ( the 3rd GG @-@ ch ; October 1942 ) and tied for first with Klaus Junge in Prague ( Duras <unk> ; December 1942 ) . In 1943 , he drew a mini @-@ match ( + 1 − 1 ) with Bogoljubov in Warsaw ( March 1943 ) , he won in Prague ( April 1943 ) and tied for first with Keres in Salzburg ( June 1943 ) . 
 By late 1943 , Alekhine was spending all his time in Spain and Portugal , as the German representative to chess events . This also allowed him to get away from the onrushing Soviet invasion into eastern Europe . In 1944 , he narrowly won a match against Ramón Rey <unk> in Zaragoza ( + 1 − 0 = 3 ; April 1944 ) and won in Gijon ( July 1944 ) . The following year , he won at Madrid ( March 1945 ) , tied for second place with Antonio Medina at Gijón ( July 1945 ; the event was won by Antonio Rico ) , won at Sabadell ( August 1945 ) , he tied for first with F. López Núñez in Almeria ( August 1945 ) , won in Melilla ( September 1945 ) and took second in Caceres , behind Francisco Lupi ( Autumn 1945 ) . Alekhine 's last match was with Lupi at Estoril near Lisbon , Portugal , in January 1946 . Alekhine won two games , lost one , and drew one . 
 Alekhine took an interest in the development of the chess prodigy Arturo Pomar and devoted a section of his last book ( ¡ <unk> ! 1946 ) to him . They played at Gijon 1944 , when Pomar , aged 12 , achieved a creditable draw with the champion . 
 = = = Final year and death = = = 
 After World War II , Alekhine was not invited to chess tournaments outside the Iberian Peninsula , because of his alleged Nazi affiliation . His original invitation to the London 1946 tournament was withdrawn when the other competitors protested . 
 While planning for a World Championship match against Botvinnik , Alekhine died aged 53 in his hotel room in Estoril , Portugal on March 24 , 1946 . The circumstances of his death are still a matter of debate . It is usually attributed to a heart attack , but a letter in Chess Life magazine from a witness to the autopsy stated that choking on meat was the actual cause of death . At autopsy , a three @-@ inch @-@ long piece of <unk> meat was discovered blocking his windpipe . Some have speculated that he was murdered by a French " death squad " . A few years later , Alekhine 's son , Alexander Alekhine , Jr . , said that " the hand of Moscow reached his father " . Canadian Grandmaster Kevin <unk> , who has lived in Portugal since the late 1980s , and who has thoroughly investigated Alekhine 's death , favors this possibility . <unk> makes a case for the manipulation of the crime scene and the autopsy by the Portuguese secret police PIDE . He believes that Alekhine was murdered outside his hotel room , probably by the Soviets . 
 Alekhine 's burial was sponsored by FIDE , and the remains were transferred to the Cimetière du Montparnasse , Paris , France in 1956 .

 Statistical ranking systems differ sharply in their views of Alekhine . " Warriors of the Mind " rates him only the 18th strongest player of all time and comments that victories over players such as Bogoljubov and Euwe are not a strong basis for an " all time " ranking . But the website " Chessmetrics " ranks him between the fourth and eighth best of all time , depending on the lengths of the peak periods being compared , and concludes that at his absolute peak he was a little stronger than Emanuel Lasker and Capablanca , although a little weaker than Botvinnik . Jeff Sonas , the author of the website " Chessmetrics " , rates Alekhine as the sixth highest peak strength , relative to other players of the same era , of all @-@ time on the basis of comparable ratings . He also assesses Alekhine 's victory at the tournament of San Remo in 1930 as the sixth best performance ever in tournaments . In his 1978 book The Rating of Chessplayers , Past and Present , Arpad Elo gave retrospective ratings to players based on their performance over the best five @-@ year span of their career . He concluded that Alekhine was the joint fifth strongest player of those surveyed ( tied with Paul Morphy and Vasily Smyslov ) , behind Capablanca , Botvinnik , Emanuel Lasker and Mikhail Tal . 
 Alekhine 's peak period was in the early 1930s , when he won almost every tournament he played , sometimes by huge margins . Afterward , his play declined , and he never won a top @-@ class tournament after 1934 . After Alekhine regained his world title in 1937 , there were several new contenders , all of whom would have been serious challengers . 
 Alekhine was one of the greatest attacking players and could apparently produce combinations at will . What set him apart from most other attacking players was his ability to see the potential for an attack and prepare for it in positions where others saw nothing . Rudolf Spielmann , a master tactician who produced many <unk> , said , " I can see the combinations as well as Alekhine , but I cannot get to the same positions . " Dr. Max Euwe said , " Alekhine is a poet who creates a work of art out of something that would hardly inspire another man to send home a picture post @-@ card . " An explanation offered by Réti was , " he beats his opponents by analysing simple and apparently harmless sequences of moves in order to see whether at some time or another at the end of it an original possibility , and therefore one difficult to see , might be hidden . " John Nunn commented that " Alekhine had a special ability to provoke complications without taking excessive risks " , and Edward Winter called him " the supreme genius of the complicated position . " Some of Alekhine 's combinations are so complex that even modern champions and contenders disagree in their analyses of them . 
 Nevertheless , Garry Kasparov said that Alekhine 's attacking play was based on solid positional foundations , and Harry Golombek went further , saying that " Alekhine was the most versatile of all chess geniuses , being equally at home in every style of play and in all phases of the game . " Reuben Fine , a serious contender for the world championship in the late 1930s , wrote in the 1950s that Alekhine 's collection of best games was one of the three most beautiful that he knew , and Golombek was equally impressed . 
 Alekhine 's games have a higher percentage of wins than those of any other World Champion , and his drawn games are on average among the longest of all champions ' . His desire to win extended beyond formal chess competition . When Fine beat him in some casual games in 1933 , Alekhine demanded a match for a small stake . And in table tennis , which Alekhine played enthusiastically but badly , he would often crush the ball when he lost . 
 Bobby Fischer , in a 1964 article , ranked Alekhine as one of the ten greatest players in history . Fischer , who was famous for the clarity of his play , wrote of Alekhine : 
 Alekhine has never been a hero of mine , and I 've never cared for his style of play . There 's nothing light or breezy about it ; it worked for him , but it could scarcely work for anyone else . He played gigantic conceptions , full of outrageous and unprecedented ideas . ... [ H ] e had great imagination ; he could see more deeply into a situation than any other player in chess history . ... It was in the most complicated positions that Alekhine found his grandest concepts . 
 Alekhine 's style had a profound influence on Kasparov , who said : " Alexander Alekhine is the first luminary among the others who are still having the greatest influence on me . I like his universality , his approach to the game , his chess ideas . I am sure that the future belongs to Alekhine chess . " In 2012 , Levon Aronian said that he considers Alekhine the greatest chess player of all time . 
 = = = Influence on the game = = = 
 Several openings and opening variations are named after Alekhine . In addition to the well @-@ known Alekhine 's Defence ( 1.e4 Nf6 ) and the Albin @-@ <unk> @-@ Alekhine Attack in the " orthodox " Paulsen variation of the French Defense , there are Alekhine Variations in : the Budapest Gambit , the Vienna Game , the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez , the Winawer Variation of the French Defense ; the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defense , the Queen 's Gambit Accepted , the Slav Defense , the Queen 's Pawn Game , the Catalan Opening and the Dutch Defense ( where three different lines bear his name ) . Irving <unk> commented , " The openings consist of Alekhine 's games , with a few variations . " 
 Alekhine also composed a few endgame studies , one of which is shown on the right , a miniature ( a study with a maximum of seven pieces ) . 
 Alekhine wrote over twenty books on chess , mostly annotated editions of the games in a major match or tournament , plus collections of his best games between 1908 and 1937 . Unlike Wilhelm Steinitz , Emanuel Lasker , Capablanca and Euwe , he wrote no books that explained his ideas about the game or showed beginners how to improve their play . His books appeal to expert players rather than beginners : they contain many long analyses of variations in critical positions , and " singularities and exceptions were his forte , not rules and simplifications " . 
 Although Alekhine was declared an enemy of the Soviet Union after his anti @-@ Bolshevik statement in 1928 , he was gradually rehabilitated by the Soviet chess elite following his death in 1946 . Alexander Kotov 's research on Alekhine 's games and career , culminating in a biography , led to a Soviet series of Alekhine Memorial tournaments . The first of these , at Moscow 1956 , was won jointly by Botvinnik and Vasily Smyslov . In their book The Soviet School of Chess Kotov and <unk> devoted a chapter to Alekhine , called him " Russia 's greatest player " and praised his capacity for seizing the initiative by concrete tactical play in the opening . Botvinnik wrote that the Soviet School of chess learned from Alekhine 's fighting qualities , capacity for self @-@ criticism and <unk> vision . Alekhine had written that success in chess required " Firstly , self @-@ knowledge ; secondly , a firm comprehension of my opponent 's strength and weakness ; thirdly , a higher aim – ... artistic and scientific accomplishments which accord our chess equal rank with other arts . " 
 = = = Accusations of " improving " games = = = 
 Samuel Reshevsky wrote that Alekhine " allegedly made up games against fictitious opponents in which he came out the victor and had these games published in various chess magazines . " In a recent book Andy Soltis lists " Alekhine 's 15 Improvements " . The most famous example is his game with five queens in Moscow in 1915 . In the actual game , Alekhine , playing as Black , beat Grigoriev in the Moscow 1915 tournament ; but in one of his books he presented the " Five Queens " variation ( starting with a move he rejected as Black in the original game ) as an actual game won by the White player in Moscow in 1915 ( he did not say in the book who was who in this version , nor that it was in the tournament ) . 
 In the position of the diagram at right , which never arose in real play , Alekhine claimed that White wins by <unk> , as after some complicated play Black is mated or goes into an endgame a queen down . Some recent analyses suggest that this is not the case : if White plays <unk> , black can play 24 ... Bg4 + ! and White has no mating attack . A later computer @-@ assisted analysis concludes that White can force a win , but only by diverging from Alekhine 's move sequence at move 20 , while there are only three queens . 
 Chess historian Edward Winter investigated a game Alekhine allegedly won in fifteen moves via a queen sacrifice at Sabadell in 1945 . Some photos of the game in progress were discovered that showed the players during the game and their chessboard . Based on the position that the chess pieces had taken on the chessboard in this photo , the game could never have taken the course that was stated in the published version . This raised suspicions that the published version was made up . Even if the published version is a fake , however , there is no doubt that Alekhine did defeat his opponent in the actual game , and there is no evidence that Alekhine was the source of the famous fifteen @-@ move win whose authenticity is doubted . 
 = = = Accusations of antisemitism = = = 
 During World War II , Alekhine played in several tournaments held in Germany or German @-@ occupied territory , as did many strong players in occupied and neutral countries . In March 1941 , a series of articles appeared under Alekhine 's name in the Pariser Zeitung , a German @-@ language newspaper published in Paris by the occupying German forces . Among other things , these articles said that Jews had a great talent for exploiting chess but showed no signs of chess artistry ; described the <unk> theories of Nimzowitsch and Réti as " this cheap bluff , this shameless self @-@ publicity " , hyped by " the majority of Anglo @-@ Jewish pseudo @-@ intellectuals " ; and described his 1937 match with Euwe as " a triumph against the Jewish conspiracy " . Alekhine was reported as making further antisemitic statements in interviews for two Spanish newspapers in September 1941 ; in one of these it was said that " Aryan chess was aggressive chess ... on the other hand , the Semitic concept admitted the idea of pure defence . " 
 Almost immediately after the liberation of Paris , Alekhine publicly stated that " he had to write two chess articles for the Pariser Zeitung before the Germans granted him his exit visa ... Articles which Alekhine claims were purely scientific were rewritten by the Germans , published and made to treat chess from a racial viewpoint . " He wrote at least two further <unk> , in an open letter to the organizer of the 1946 London tournament ( W. Hatton @-@ Ward ) and in his posthumous book ¡ <unk> ! . These three denials are phrased differently . 
 Extensive investigations by Ken Whyld have not yielded conclusive evidence of the authenticity of the articles . Chess writer Jacques Le Monnier claimed in a 1986 issue of Europe Échecs that in 1958 he saw some of Alekhine 's notebooks and found , in Alekhine 's own handwriting , the exact text of the first antisemitic article , which appeared in Pariser Zeitung on March 18 , 1941 . In his 1973 book 75 parties d <unk> ( " 75 of Alekhine 's games " ) , however , Le Monnier had written " It will never be known whether Alekhine was behind these articles or whether they were manipulated by the editor of the Pariser Zeitung . " 
 British chess historian Edward G. Winter notes that the articles in the Pariser Zeitung misspelled the names of several famous chess masters , which could be interpreted as evidence of forgery or as attempts by Alekhine to signal that he was being forced to write things that he did not believe ; but these could simply have been typesetting errors , as Alekhine 's handwriting was not easy to read . The articles contained ( probably ) incorrect claims that Lionel Kieseritzky ( <unk> in English , <unk> in Polish ) was a Polish Jew , although ( probably ) Kieseritzky was neither Polish nor Jewish . Winter concludes : " Although , as things stand , it is difficult to construct much of a defence for Alekhine , only the discovery of the articles in his own handwriting will settle the matter beyond all doubt . " Under current French copyright law , Alekhine 's notebooks will not enter the public domain until January 1 , 2017 . 
 There is evidence that Alekhine was not antisemitic in his personal or chess relationships with Jews . In June 1919 , he was arrested by the Cheka , imprisoned in Odessa and sentenced to death . Yakov <unk> , a Jewish master , saved him by sending a telegram to the chairman of the Ukrainian Council of People 's Commissars , who knew of Alekhine and ordered his release . Alekhine accepted and apparently used chess analysis from Charles Jaffe in his World Championship match against Capablanca . Jaffe was a Jewish master who lived in New York , where Alekhine often visited , and upon his return to New York after defeating Capablanca , Alekhine played a short match as a favour to Jaffe , without financial remuneration . Alekhine 's second for the 1935 match with Max Euwe was the master Salo Landau , a Dutch Jew . The American Jewish grandmaster Arnold Denker wrote that he found Alekhine very friendly in chess settings , taking part in consultation games and productive analysis sessions . Denker also wrote that Alekhine treated the younger and ( at that time ) virtually unproven Denker to dinner on many occasions in New York during the 1930s , when the economy was very weak because of the Great Depression . Denker added that Alekhine , during the early 1930s , opined that the American Jewish grandmaster Isaac <unk> might be his next challenger ( this did not in fact occur ) . He gave chess lessons to 14 @-@ year @-@ old prodigy Gerardo <unk> , a German Jew , in Paris in Spring 1940 . Alekhine also married an American woman who may have had Jewish ancestry , Grace <unk> , as his fourth wife . Mrs. Grace Alekhine was the women 's champion of Paris in 1944 .

 Luke McLuke ( 1911 – c . 1929 ) was a bay Thoroughbred stallion born in the United States ; he won the 1914 Belmont Stakes , the Carlton Stakes , Kentucky Handicap , and Grainger Memorial Handicap among his four wins from six starts . After his racing career was over , he became a breeding stallion , where he sired 11 stakes winners . Two of his daughters were named as year @-@ end Champions in the United States . 
 = = Breeding and background = = 
 Luke McLuke 's sire was Ultimus , and his dam was an imported mare named Midge , a daughter of the English Thoroughbred Trenton . Midge 's dam was another imported mare named Sandfly by the English stallion <unk> . Ultimus was inbred to Commando , as both his sire and dam were sired by Domino . Ultimus never raced , however . 
 Luke McLuke was bred by James R. Keene at Castleton Stud , but was sold , along with the entire stock of the 1911 foal crop , in 1912 as yearlings . He was originally bought as part of a group lot of all 16 of the colts , bought by William A. Prime for $ 25 @,@ 000 ( about $ 613 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) , who promptly turned around sold the horses to Edward R. Bradley . Bradley then auctioned them off for a total of $ 57 @,@ 650 ( around $ 1 @,@ 414 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) shortly after purchasing them . John Schorr of Memphis , Tennessee bought Luke McLuke for $ 1 @,@ 700 ( approximately $ 42 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) . Although unraced as a two @-@ year @-@ old , Luke McLuke raced as a three @-@ year @-@ old for Schorr . In Schorr 's ownership , the stallion won the Belmont Stakes . 
 Luke McLuke was expected to be a sprinter , as his breeding , especially on his sire 's side , was mostly raced at shorter distances .

The Grainger was a race for three @-@ year @-@ olds and up , at a distance of 1 1 ⁄ 4 mi ( 2 @.@ 0 km ) and was run at Churchill Downs in Louisville , Kentucky . Luke McLuke carried 100 lb ( 45 kg ) in the race , and was ridden by A. <unk> for the win . Second place was Rudolfo and third went to Solar Star . The win earned him $ 11 @,@ 500 ( $ 272 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) , and the winning time was 2 minutes and 2 and 4 ⁄ 5 seconds . 
 Luke McLuke was trained by Schorr 's son , J. F. Schorr . Luke McLuke 's race wins in 1914 helped make the elder Schorr the leading owner for 1914 , the second time he had earned that title . The younger Schorr was the leading trainer in 1914 , the first time he topped that list . The stallion 's overall racing record was four wins in six starts with one second and one third .

His daughter Nellie Morse was the dam of Nellie Flagg , the 1934 Champion Two @-@ Year @-@ Old Filly . After her racing career was over , Nellie Flagg went on to become one of the foundation broodmares at Calumet Farm in Kentucky . A grandson was Three Bars , out of a Luke McLuke daughter named Myrtle Dee . Three Bars went on to become an influential sire of Quarter Horses , and was named to the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1989 . Another daughter , <unk> , produced the 1966 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year , <unk> Nurse . Luke McLuke 's granddaughter Nellie Flagg was in turn the dam of Mar @-@ Kell , the 1943 Champion Handicap Mare . 
 The Chicago Tribune reported the death of Luke McLuke in February 1929 , but noted the horse had died suddenly in his exercise paddock at the farm of John Hertz many weeks before the press release . He was recorded as dead in the 1932 edition of the American Racing Manual .

 = Eurasian treecreeper = 
 The Eurasian treecreeper or common treecreeper ( Certhia familiaris ) is a small passerine bird also known in the British Isles , where it is the only living member of its genus , simply as treecreeper . It is similar to other treecreepers , and has a curved bill , patterned brown upperparts , whitish underparts , and long stiff tail feathers which help it creep up tree trunks . It can be most easily distinguished from the similar short @-@ toed treecreeper , which shares much of its European range , by its different song . 
 The Eurasian treecreeper has nine or more subspecies which breed in different parts of its range in temperate Eurasia . This species is found in woodlands of all kinds , but where it overlaps with the short @-@ toed treecreeper in western Europe it is more likely to be found in coniferous forests or at higher altitudes . It nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes , and favours introduced giant sequoia as nest sites where they are available . The female typically lays five or six pink @-@ speckled white eggs in the lined nest , but eggs and chicks are vulnerable to attack by woodpeckers and mammals , including squirrels . 
 The Eurasian treecreeper is insectivorous and climbs up tree trunks like a mouse , to search for insects which it picks from crevices in the bark with its fine curved bill . It then flies to the base of another tree with a distinctive erratic flight . This bird is solitary in winter , but may form communal roosts in cold weather .

 Similar in appearance , all treecreepers are small birds with streaked and spotted brown upperparts , rufous rumps and whitish underparts . They have long decurved bills , and long rigid tail feathers that provide support as they creep up tree trunks looking for insects . 
 The Eurasian treecreeper is 12 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) long and weighs 7 @.@ 0 – 12 @.@ 9 g ( 0 @.@ 25 – 0 @.@ 46 oz ) . It has warm brown upperparts intricately patterned with black , buff and white , and a plain brown tail . Its belly , flanks and vent area are tinged with buff . The sexes are similar , but the juvenile has duller upperparts than the adult , and its underparts are dull white with dark fine spotting on the flanks . 
 The contact call is a very quiet , thin and high @-@ pitched sit , but the most distinctive call is a penetrating <unk> , with a vibrato quality , sometimes repeated as a series of notes . The male 's song begins with <unk> , <unk> followed in turn by a few twittering notes , a longer descending ripple , and a whistle that falls and then rises . 
 The range of the Eurasian treecreeper overlaps with that of several other treecreepers , which can present local identification problems . In Europe , the Eurasian treecreeper shares much of its range with the short @-@ toed treecreeper . Compared to that species , it is whiter below , warmer and more spotted above , and has a whiter supercilium and slightly shorter bill . Visual identification , even in the hand , may be impossible for poorly marked birds . A singing treecreeper is usually identifiable , since short @-@ toed treecreeper has a distinctive series of evenly spaced notes sounding quite different from the song of Eurasian treecreeper ; however , both species have been known to sing the other 's song . 
 Three Himalayan subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper are now sometimes given full species status as Hodgson 's treecreeper , for example by BirdLife International , but if they are retained as subspecies of Eurasian , they have to be distinguished from three other South Asian treecreepers . The plain tail of Eurasian treecreeper differentiates it from bar @-@ tailed treecreeper , which has a distinctive barred tail pattern , and its white throat is an obvious difference from brown @-@ throated treecreeper . Rusty @-@ flanked treecreeper is more difficult to separate from Eurasian , but has more contrasting cinnamon , rather than buff , flanks . 
 The North American brown creeper has never been recorded in Europe , but an autumn vagrant would be difficult to identify , since it would not be singing , and the American species ' call is much like that of Eurasian treecreeper . In appearance , brown creeper is more like short @-@ toed than Eurasian , but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Eurasian treecreeper was first described under its current scientific name by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 . The binomial name is derived from Greek <unk> , a small tree @-@ dwelling bird described by Aristotle and others , and Latin familiaris , familiar or common . 
 This species is one of a group of very similar typical treecreeper species , all placed in the single genus Certhia . Eight species are currently recognised , in two evolutionary lineages : a Holarctic radiation , and a southern Asian group . The Holarctic group has a more warbling song , always ( except in C. familiaris from China ) starting or ending with a shrill <unk> . Species in the southern group , in contrast , have a faster @-@ paced trill without the <unk> sound . All the species have distinctive vocalizations and some subspecies have been elevated to species on the basis of their calls . 
 The Eurasian treecreeper belongs to the northern group , along with the North American brown creeper , C. americana , the short @-@ toed treecreeper , C. <unk> , of western Eurasia , and , if it is considered a separate species , Hodgson 's treecreeper , C. <unk> , from the southern rim of the Himalayas . 
 The brown creeper has sometimes been considered to be a subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper , but has closer affinities to short @-@ toed treecreeper , and is normally now treated as a full species . Hodgson 's treecreeper is a more recent proposed split following studies of its cytochrome b mtDNA sequence and song structure that indicate that it may well be a distinct species from C. familiaris . 
 There are nine to twelve subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper , depending on the taxonomic view taken , which are all very similar and often interbreed in areas where their ranges overlap . There is a general cline in appearance from west to east across Eurasia , with subspecies becoming greyer above and whiter below , but this trend reverses east of the Amur River . The currently recognised subspecies are as follows : 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Eurasian treecreeper is the most widespread member of its genus , breeding in temperate woodlands across Eurasia from Ireland to Japan . It prefers mature trees , and in most of Europe , where it shares its range with short @-@ toed treecreeper , it tends to be found mainly in coniferous forest , especially spruce and fir . However , where it is the only treecreeper , as in European Russia , or the British Isles , it frequents broadleaved or mixed woodland in preference to conifers . 
 The Eurasian treecreeper breeds down to sea level in the north of its range , but tends to be a highland species further south . In the Pyrenees it breeds above 1 @,@ 370 metres ( 4 @,@ 490 feet ) , in China from 400 – 2 @,@ 100 metres ( 1 @,@ 300 – 6 @,@ 900 ft ) and in southern Japan from 1 @,@ 065 – 2 @,@ 135 metres ( 3 @,@ 494 – 7 @,@ 005 ft ) . The breeding areas have July isotherms between 14 – 16 ° C and 23 – 24 ° C ( 73 – 75 ° F ) and 72 – 73 ° F ) . 
 The Eurasian treecreeper is non @-@ migratory in the milder west and south of its breeding range , but some northern birds move south in winter , and individuals breeding on mountains may descend to a lower altitude in winter . Winter movements and post @-@ breeding dispersal may lead to vagrancy outside the normal range . Wintering migrants of the Asian subspecies have been recorded in South Korea and China , and the nominate form has been recorded west of its breeding range as far as Orkney , Scotland . The Eurasian treecreeper has also occurred as a vagrant to the Channel Islands ( where the short @-@ toed is the resident species ) , Majorca and the Faroe Islands . 
 = = = Status = = = 
 This species has an extensive range of about 10 million km2 ( 3 @.@ 8 million square miles ) . It has a large population , including an estimated 11 – 20 million individuals in Europe alone . Population trends have not been quantified , but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List ( declining more than 30 % in ten years or three generations ) . For these reasons , the species is evaluated as Least Concern . 
 It is common through much of its range , but in the northernmost areas it is rare , since it is vulnerable to hard winters , especially if its feeding is disrupted by an ice glaze on the trees or freezing rain . It is also uncommon in Turkey and the Caucasus . In the west of its range it has spread to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland , pushed further north in Norway , and first bred in the Netherlands in 1993 . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The Eurasian treecreeper breeds from the age of one year , nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes . Where present , the introduced North American giant sequoia is a favourite nesting tree , since a nest cavity can be easily hollowed out in its soft bark . <unk> in buildings or walls are sometimes used , and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland . The nest has a base of twigs , pine needles , grass or bark , and a lining of finer material such as feathers , wool , moss , lichen or spider web . 
 In Europe , the typical clutch of five – six eggs is laid between March and June , but in Japan three – five eggs are laid from May to July . The eggs are white with very fine pinkish speckles mainly at the broad end , measure 16 mm × 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 63 in × 0 @.@ 47 in ) and weigh 1 @.@ 2 g ( 0 @.@ 042 oz ) of which 6 % is shell . The eggs are incubated by the female alone for 13 – 17 days until the altricial downy chicks hatch ; they are then fed by both parents , but brooded by the female alone , for a further 15 – 17 days to fledging . Juveniles return to the nest for a few nights after fledging . About 20 % of pairs , mainly in the south and west , raise a second brood . 
 Predators of treecreeper nests and young include the great spotted woodpecker , red squirrel , and small mustelids , and predation is about three times higher in fragmented landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland ( 32 @.@ 4 % against 12 @.@ 0 % in less fragmented woodlands ) . The predation rate increases with the amount of forest edge close to a nest site , and also the presence of nearby agricultural land , in both cases probably because of a higher degree of mustelid predation . This species is parasitised in the nest by the moorhen flea , Dasypsyllus gallinulae . The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown , but 47 @.@ 7 % of adults survive each year . The typical lifespan is two years , but the maximum recorded age is eight years and ten months . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The Eurasian treecreeper typically seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks , starting near the tree base and working its way up using its stiff tail feathers for support . Unlike a nuthatch , it does not come down trees head first , but flies to the base of another nearby tree . It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark . Although normally found on trees , it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls , bare ground , or amongst fallen pine needles , and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months . 
 The female Eurasian treecreeper forages primarily on the upper parts of the tree trunks , while the male uses the lower parts . A study in Finland found that if a male disappears , the unpaired female will forage at lower heights , spend less time on each tree and have shorter foraging bouts than a paired female . 
 This bird may sometimes join mixed @-@ species feeding flocks in winter , but it does not appear to share the resources found by accompanying tits and goldcrests , and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock . Wood ants share the same habitat as the treecreeper , and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks . The Finnish researchers found that where the ants have been foraging , there are fewer arthropods , and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants . 
 = = = Habits = = = 
 As a small woodland bird with cryptic plumage and a quiet call , the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse @-@ like up a vertical trunk , progressing in short hops , using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support . Nevertheless , it is not wary , and is largely indifferent to the presence of humans . It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight , alternating fluttering butterfly @-@ like wing beats with side @-@ slips and tumbles . Migrating birds may fly by day or night , but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations . It is solitary in winter , but in cold weather up to a dozen or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice .

 Dragon Ball Z : Attack of the Saiyans , known in Japan as Dragon Ball Kai : Saiyan Invasion ( <unk> <unk> , Doragon Bōru Kai <unk> <unk> ) , is a video game based on the manga and anime series Dragon Ball for the Nintendo DS . The game is developed by Monolith Soft and distributed by Namco Bandai in North America and everywhere else under the Bandai label . It was released in Japan on April 29 , 2009 . The game was released in Europe and North America in November 2009 . The game was originally planned to use the Z moniker , despite starting with events that occur in Dragon Ball , but was changed to Kai to associate it with the Dragon Ball Kai revision . 
 The game is a turn @-@ based RPG that allows players to take on the role of six characters from the series , starting from the 23rd Tenkaichi Budokai through the Saiyan story arc . The game is one of the first games in the Dragon Ball franchise to be published by Namco Bandai in North America , as the company would acquire the gaming license from previous license holder Atari in July of that same year . 
 Attack of the Saiyans was generally well received by gaming critics , complimenting the battle system , its visuals , and its ability to stay true to the series . It would go on to be the third @-@ best selling video game during the month of May 2009 in Japan . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Presented in traditional 2 @-@ D animation sprites , the game consists of three modes to help navigate , the map of the Dragon World , the area maps , and the battle mode . The world map will be available from the start , and will allow players easy access to each of the areas throughout the game . On area maps the player will navigate through various places such fields , forests , caves , and towns on the top screen . The touch screen will display available equipment that can be used while in fields . These items are available courtesy of Capsule Corporation Dyno @-@ Caps which can be bought , given , or found in various spots and or treasure chests . Many of these areas have obstacles such as rocks and brush which the player will have overcome with ki blasts . However , some of these obstacles require stronger levels of ki blasts . The battle screen will take place at the screen with the party facing off with a monster or a boss , their stats and the command select icon presented via the touch screen . The game makes little to no use of the stylus , forcing players to rely on the control pad . 
 In combat , the player 's active party members will consist of only first three members of their party or less . Players can swap available members at any time throughout the game . Each character will have a few set attacks and techniques at the player 's disposal while the rest are locked . When the player wins a battle , each member of their party will earn Ability Points or AP . Ability Points can be used to buy or upgrade skills in a character 's skill menu . When certain skills are unlocked or upgraded new skills will become available . Each character will have a " Rage Gage " . This meter will gradually fill throughout the course of combat . When a character 's gauge is full , they can perform an ultimate attack . If two or more characters gauges are full , the player can execute a Sparking Combo . By which the chose characters will perform a tag team attack . When an ultimate attack or a Sparking Combo is performed the gauge returns to zero . Players also have the ability to block enemy attacks with the Active Guard or A Guard . This allows a chosen character to only take minimal damage when their corresponding button is pressed at the moment before an attack .

The article stated that the game would be an RPG in development by Monolith Soft exclusively for the DS , it would take start at the 23rd Tenkaichi Budokai and extend into the Saiyan saga , and it would be released sometime in 2009 . Several screenshots were shown in the article . One of which depicted different looking graphics command icons . It was also revealed that only six of the main characters Goku , Gohan , Piccolo , <unk> , Tien , and Yamcha , would be playable . In the February issue of V Jump , it was announced that the title had been changed to tie @-@ in with the revised series , Dragon Ball Kai . 
 On May 25 , Namco Bandai 's European branch released a press statement announcing that they would be releasing the game throughout Europe and the PAL regions under the new name Dragon Ball Z : Attack of the Saiyans .

The announcement also mention that the game would include numerous alternate storylines for a better understanding of the Dragon Ball universe , a three character party and combo attack system , that certain ki attacks would be needed to solve puzzles or unlock secrets , and that their release date would be sometime in the Fall of 2009 . Following that statement , the company issued another press release stating that they had acquired the North American license from previous license holder Atari , and would publish future Dragon Ball games for , at least , the next five years starting with Attack of the Saiyans , Raging Blast , and Revenge of King Piccolo . In November , Namco Bandai issued a press release stating that the game was available throughout all North American markets .

Yet he stated that if players were not Dragon Ball fans , then they will not want to play the game . Robert Thompson of Nintendojo felt that the game would satisfy fans of both the series and the genre , but he would complain about the ki and Sparking Combo attacks being repetitive , and the story shifting control of the characters , stating it could make unfamiliar gamers disoriented . Ryan Olsen of <unk> praised the battle system , calling it more engaging than the ones found in the average RPG . Still he would call the game a cut and dry RPG , calling the Active Guard system the only exotic aspect of the game . Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report called the game vanilla with an interesting twists , stating that the fans should be the ones playing the game . He also drew comparisons of the Active Guard system to the Timed Hit system from Super Mario RPG , and Rage Gage to the Limit Break from Final Fantasy . Brittany Vincent of RPGFan would call side quests like <unk> 's return home an added treat to the long story . She pointed out the game 's difficulty being frustrating , stating that the game will cause players to revert to the start screen many times , yet is still beatable . 
 Joe Law of GameFocus criticized the Rage Gage system , stating that it had been done better in other games . However he cited the game 's overall length a good thing as he felt the game had no replay value . Nick Valentino of GameZone praised the game , calling it the best RPG to make use of the Dragon Ball label , and the game was the perfect introduction into the franchise .

Kat Bailey of 1UP.com felt the game was made with children in mind , stating that the vibrant colors and the fast @-@ paced gameplay would keep kids interested in the game . 
 = Buso Renkin = 
 Buso Renkin ( Japanese : 武装錬金 , Hepburn : <unk> Renkin , lit . " Arms Alchemy " ) is a manga series written and drawn by Nobuhiro Watsuki . It follows Kazuki Muto , who becomes an alchemical warrior in the battle against alchemical monsters known as homunculi . Watsuki envisioned the manga as his last shōnen manga , and then he tried to do as much as he could with that genre . It was serialized in Shueisha 's magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from June 2003 to April 2005 . The individual chapters were republished by Shueisha in ten tankōbon volumes . The series has been licensed by Viz Media for North American release . 
 The manga has been adapted into an anime television series , which was produced by Xebec and was broadcast on Japanese television network TV Tokyo from 2006 to 2007 . In December 2007 , the anime was announced for North American DVD release by Viz Media . In 2009 , the series made its American television debut on the Funimation Channel , with American broadcast rights acquired by Funimation from Viz Media . The series has also spawned two drama CDs , two light novels , a PlayStation 2 video game , and many types of Buso Renkin @-@ themed merchandise . 
 In Japan , the Buso Renkin manga has sold over 3 million volumes and was nominated for a Seiun Award . It received a mixed reception from manga and anime publications . Watsuki 's art received the most positive comments from reviewers , while other aspects of the manga , such as its action and characters , have divided critics ' opinions . The anime , which critics described as a generic shōnen fighting series , received a mostly negative reception . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The narrative of Buso Renkin follows Kazuki Muto , who saves Tokiko <unk> and is killed by an alchemical monster known as a homunculus . Tokiko , an alchemist warrior , feels responsible and revives him by replacing his destroyed heart with a kakugane ( <unk> ) . The kakugane is an alchemical device which , when activated , takes a weapon form based on its user 's personality , forming a <unk> <unk> — the only thing that can destroy a homunculus . Kazuki creates his own <unk> <unk> and joins Tokiko in the fight against the homunculi and their master , <unk> Chouno . Chouno , who has renamed himself " Papillon " , is killed by Kazuki , but is later resurrected by the L.X.E. , a humanoid homunculi group led by Chouno 's great @-@ great @-@ grandfather <unk> Chouno , now calling himself Dr. Butterfly . In various battles , Kazuki , Tokiko and Captain Bravo ( their team leader ) destroy most of the L.X.E. ' s members . After learning that Dr. Butterfly believes him to be weak and useless , Papillon rebels against the L.X.E. and kills Dr. Butterfly . 
 Before his death , Dr. Butterfly drains the energy of the students at Kazuki 's school to heal and revive Victor , a being superior to humans and homunculi . Victor is confronted by Kazuki , but Victor is not interested in fighting and leaves . During the battle , however , Kazuki 's kakugane is revealed to be the same type as the Victor 's — a black kakugane created by the Alchemist Army as a prototype to the philosopher 's stone . The black kakugane absorbs human life forces ; to prevent this from happening , Kazuki 's death is ordered by the Alchemist Army . Captain Bravo tries to kill Kazuki , but Tokiko finds him alive . A team is commissioned to confirm Kazuki 's death , but Kazuki , Tokiko and <unk> Nakamura ( an Alchemist Warrior and former protégé of Tokiko 's ) fight their way past the members of the Re @-@ Extermination Squad . Later , Kazuki 's death is postponed because , as the Alchemists ' leader explains , their top priority is to defeat Victor . 
 Kazuki and Tokiko find the white kakugane , which can negate the effects of the black kakugane and is guarded by Victor 's daughter Victoria , who is herself a humanoid homunculus . During the Alchemist Army 's final battle against Victor , Kazuki applies the white kakugane to Victor , but it only weakens him . To protect humankind from both of them , Kazuki propels himself and Victor to the moon . Later , Papillion creates a white kakugane to heal Kazuki . The Alchemist Army rescues Kazuki , creates another white kakugane and restores Victor 's humanity . Reunited with his daughter , Victor asks the Alchemist Army to turn him into a homunculus and tells them that he and his daughter will lead all the homunculi to the moon . The Alchemist Army dedicates itself to research a way to revert homunculi back into humans , ending their war activities . All Warriors abdicate their kakugane . Kazuki and Tokiko return to their daily lives together while Papillon becomes an urban legend throughout Japan .

 Nobuhiro Watsuki started writing Buso Renkin thinking it would be his last shōnen manga ; he tried to do " everything [ he ] ever wanted " with that genre . He unexpectedly experienced problems drawing the manga 's fight scenes and said he " struggled with the comedic elements " . Watsuki drew references from several sources in Buso Renkin ; from his past works Rurouni Kenshin and Gun Blaze West to American comics , and from films to other anime and manga . Despite dealing with alchemy , Watsuki initially avoided mentioning the philosopher 's stone because he thought he could be accused of plagiarizing another series . He could not omit mentioning it , but he said that it is " general knowledge " . During the series ' publication , Watsuki had four severe colds ; the fourth cold made him so weak that he could not finish the chapter he was due to send to Weekly Shōnen Jump .

 The manga 's critical reaction has been mixed . Most critics reached a consensus regarding the high quality of its art , describing it as " crisp " , " solid " , and " clean and well done " . Other aspects of the series have divided critics ' opinions . Manga Life 's Michael Aronson praised the enemy designs , while Carlo Santos of Anime News Network ( ANN ) criticized them , adding the series " is not much fun to read , and certainly no fun to look at " . Writing for Active Anime , Sandra Scholes found points of interest in the series ' story , and praised its action . Santos said the action " got all the drive and excitement of <unk> action " , and Comic Book Bin 's Leroy Douresseaux called the series " a mixture of Dragonball Z and Naruto , but filled with even more weirdness " . 
 Aronson said the storytelling and action needed " clarity " . Leigh Dragoon from Sequential Tart described Buso Renkin as " derivative " and " hackneyed " , and called the characters " completely forgettable " . Conversely , Patti Martinson writing for the same site said that they " are distinctive and interesting " . Martinson noted " the complexity of the plot " , though she said it is not difficult to follow . She added there was " a lot of strong material " that can be developed throughout the series .

 Silverchair 's alternative rock sound had evolved throughout their career , differing styles on specific albums steadily growing more ambitious over the years , from grunge on their debut to more recent work displaying orchestral and art rock influences . The songwriting and singing of Johns had evolved steadily while the band had developed an increased element of complexity . In 2003 , following the release of Diorama , the band announced a hiatus , during which time members recorded with side projects The Dissociatives , The Mess Hall , and Tambalane . Silverchair were reunited at the 2005 Wave Aid concerts . In 2007 , they released their fifth album , Young Modern , and played the Across the Great Divide tour with contemporaries Powderfinger . In May 2011 , Silverchair announced an indefinite hiatus . Prior to that month , the group had sold close to 8 million albums worldwide . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation and early releases ( 1992 – 1996 ) = = = 
 Silverchair 's founders , Ben Gillies and Daniel Johns , attended the same primary school in the Newcastle suburb of Merewether . As teenagers , singer @-@ guitarist Johns and drummer Gillies , started playing music together – in one class they built a stage out of desks and played rap songs for their schoolmates . When they moved on to Newcastle High School , a fellow student , Chris Joannou , joined the pair on bass guitar . In 1992 , they formed Death Rides a Sandwich with Tobin <unk> as a second guitarist – but he soon left . They played numerous shows around the Hunter Region in their early teens , their repertoire was cover versions of Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple and Black Sabbath . In 1994 Innocent Criminals entered <unk> , a national competition for school @-@ based bands and placed first ahead of older competition . Early in the year they recorded demos of " Acid Rain " , " Cicada " , " Pure Massacre " and " Tomorrow " at Platinum Sound Studios . 
 In April , the band 's mainstream breakthrough came when they won a national competition called Pick Me , using their demo of " Tomorrow " . The competition was conducted by the SBS TV show Nomad and Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) alternative radio station Triple J. As part of the prize , Triple J recorded the song and ABC filmed a video , which was aired on 16 June . For the video 's broadcast , they had changed their name to Silverchair ( styled as silverchair until 2002 ) . In a 1994 interview with Melbourne magazine Buzz , the band claimed the name derived from a radio request for " Sliver " by Nirvana and " Berlin Chair " by You Am I being mixed up as Silver Chair . It was later revealed they were named for the C. S. Lewis @-@ penned novel The Silver Chair from The Chronicles of Narnia series . 
 Following a bidding war between rival labels , Silverchair signed a three @-@ album recording contract with Sony Music subsidiary Murmur Records . Initially the group were managed by their parents . Sony A & R manager John Watson , who was jointly responsible for signing the group , subsequently left the label to become their band manager . In September , their Triple J recording of " Tomorrow " was released as a four @-@ track extended play . From late October , it spent six weeks at number @-@ one on the ARIA Singles Chart . In 1995 , a re @-@ recorded version of " Tomorrow " ( and a new video ) was made for the United States market , becoming the most played song on US modern rock radio that year . 
 Silverchair 's debut album , Frogstomp , was recorded in nine days with production by Kevin Shirley ( Lime Spiders , Peter Wells ) and was released in March 1995 . At the time of recording , the band members were 15 years old , and still attending high school . Frogstomp 's lyrical concepts were fiction @-@ based , drawing inspiration from television , hometown tragedies , and perceptions of the pain of friends . The album was well received : Allmusic and Rolling Stone rated it in four and four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars respectively , praising the intensity of the album , especially " Tomorrow " . Aside from Innocent Criminals , the band has used The George Costanza Trio and Short Elvis as aliases . 
 Frogstomp was a number @-@ one album in Australia and New Zealand . It reached the Billboard 200 Top 10 , making Silverchair the first Australian band to do so since INXS . It was certified as a US double @-@ platinum album by the RIAA , triple @-@ platinum in Canada by the CRIA and multi @-@ platinum in Australia . The album sold more than 2 @.@ 5 million copies worldwide . As Frogstomp and " Tomorrow " continued to gain popularity through 1995 , the group toured the US where they supported Red Hot Chili Peppers in June , The Ramones in September , and played on the roof of Radio City Music Hall at the MTV Music Awards – in between touring they continued their secondary education in Newcastle . At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 , the band won five awards out of nine nominations . To collect their awards on the night they sent Josh Shirley , the young son of the album 's producer . 
 In a January 1996 murder case , the defendant counsel for Brian Bassett , 16 , and Nicholaus McDonald , 18 , claimed that the pair listened to " Israel 's Son " , from Frogstomp , which contributed to the murder of Bassett 's parents and a younger brother . McDonald 's lawyer cited the lyrics " ' Hate is what I feel for you / I want you to know that I want you dead ' " which were " almost a script . They 're relevant to everything that happened " . The band 's manager , Watson , issued a statement that they did not condone nor intend any such acts of violence . Prosecutors rejected the defence case and convinced the jury that the murder was committed to " steal money and belongings and run off to California . " 
 = = = Critical and commercial success ( 1997 – 2001 ) = = = 
 Silverchair began recording their second studio album , Freak Show , in May 1996 while experiencing the success of Frogstomp in Australia and the US . It was produced by Nick Launay ( Birthday Party , Models , Midnight Oil ) and was released in February 1997 . The album reached number @-@ one in Australia and yielded three Top 10 singles – " Freak " , " Abuse Me " , and " Cemetery " . Its fourth single , " The Door " , reached No. 25 . The songs focused on the anger and backlash that the expectations of Frogstomp brought upon the band . Freak Show was certified gold in the US , 4 × platinum in Australia and global sales eventually exceeded 1 @.@ 5 million copies . 
 By late 1997 , the trio had completed their secondary education and , from May 1998 , they worked on their third album , Neon Ballroom which had Launay producing again . It was released in March 1999 and peaked at number @-@ one in Australia . McFarlane said , " As well as being the band 's best album to date , it was universally acknowledged as one of the best albums of the year . " The band originally intended to take a 12 @-@ month @-@ break , but in the end decided to devote their time to making music . Neon Ballroom provided three Australian top 20 singles : " Anthem for the Year 2000 " , " Ana 's Song ( Open Fire ) " and " Miss You Love " ; a fourth single , " Paint Pastel Princess " , did not reach the top 50 . The albums charted well internationally : Freak Show reached No. 2 in Canada , and Neon Ballroom reached No. 5 . Both reached the top 40 on the United Kingdom Albums Chart . " Abuse Me " reached No. 4 on Billboard 's Hot Modern Rock Tracks and Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks charts . " Ana 's Song ( Open Fire ) " peaked at No. 12 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks . 
 In 1999 , Johns announced that he had developed the eating disorder , anorexia nervosa , due to anxiety . Johns noted that the lyrics to " Ana 's Song ( Open Fire ) " dealt with his disorder , where he would " eat what he needed … to stay awake . " He revealed that his eating problems developed from the time of Freak Show and when Neon Ballroom was written he " hated music , really everything about it " , but felt that he " couldn 't stop doing it ; I felt like a slave to it . " Johns sought therapy and medication but felt " It 's easier for me to express it through music and lyrics " . 
 Silverchair added an auxiliary keyboardist , Sam Holloway ( ex @-@ <unk> ) , for the Neon Ballroom Tour . The US leg had the group playing with The Offspring and Red Hot Chili Peppers , while Silverchair 's tour of UK and European had The Living End as the support act . Rolling Stone 's Neva Chonin attributed their chart success to the album 's more " mature " sound . In Europe and South America it became the group 's most successful album to date . The group appeared at festivals in Reading and Edgefest , amongst others . Following the tour , the band announced that they would be taking a 12 @-@ month @-@ break . Their only live performance in 2000 was at the Falls Festival on New Year 's Eve . On 21 January 2001 , the band played to 250 @,@ 000 people at Rock in Rio , a show they described as the highlight of their career . 
 After the release of Neon Ballroom , Silverchair 's three album contract with Sony Music had ended . The group eventually signed with Atlantic Records for North and South America , and formed their own label with Watson , Eleven : A Music Company ( distributed by EMI ) , for Australia and Asia . In November 2000 , after the group had left the label , Sony issued The Best of Volume 1 without the band 's involvement . Johns disavowed the compilation , " We thought about putting out ads in the street press to make people aware that we weren 't endorsing it , but that would have blown the whole thing out of proportion ... If people want to buy it , they can buy it but I wouldn 't buy it if I was a silverchair fan . "

 In June 2001 , Silverchair entered a studio in Sydney with producer David Bottrill ( Tool , Peter Gabriel , King Crimson ) to start work on their fourth album , Diorama . Johns formally assumed the role of a co @-@ producer . The album name means " a world within a world " . Most tracks came from Johns ' new @-@ found method of writing material on a piano , a technique he developed during the band 's break after Neon Ballroom . 
 In order to complete the vision for Diorama , several other musicians contributed to the album , including Van Dyke Parks , who provided orchestral arrangements to " Tuna in the Brine " , " Luv Your Life " , and " Across the Night " . Paul Mac ( from Itch @-@ E and Scratch @-@ E ) and Jim Moginie ( from Midnight Oil ) both on piano also collaborated with the band . While recording Diorama , Johns referred to himself as an artist , rather than simply being in a " rock band " . Upon its release , critics commented that the album was more artistic than previous works . 
 Early in December , the first single , " The Greatest View " , was released to Australian radio networks . Its physical release in January 2002 coincided with the band 's appearance on the Big Day Out tour . Early in 2002 , Johns was diagnosed with reactive arthritis which made it difficult for him to play the guitar and subsequent performances supporting the album 's release were cancelled . In March , Diorama was issued and topped the ARIA Albums Chart – it became their fourth number @-@ one album and spent 50 weeks in the top 50 . 
 Five singles were released from the album : " The Greatest View " , " Without You " , " Luv Your Life " , " Across the Night " , and " After All These Years " – " The Greatest View " charted highest , reaching No. 3 . In October , Silverchair were successful at the ARIA Music Awards of 2002 , winning five awards including ' Best Rock Album ' and ' Best Group ' , and ' Producer of the Year ' for Johns . The band played " The Greatest View " at the ceremony : the song was also nominated for ' Best Video ' . Two singles ( and a related video ) were nominated for further ARIA Awards in 2003 . Following the 2002 ARIA Awards , the band announced an indefinite hiatus . Johns said it was necessary " given the fact the band were together for over a decade and yet were only , on average , 23 years old " . From March to June 2003 , Silverchair undertook the Across the Night Tour to perform Diorama . Their hometown performance on 19 April was recorded as Live from Faraway Stables for a 2 × CD and <unk> released in November . After the tour finished in June the group announced an indefinite hiatus .

 In 2000 , while also working with Silverchair , Johns and Mac released an internet @-@ only EP , I Can 't Believe It 's Not Rock . In mid @-@ 2003 , during Silverchair 's hiatus , the pair re @-@ united and formed The Dissociatives , releasing a self @-@ titled album in April 2004 . The duo provided the theme music for the popular ABC @-@ TV music quiz show <unk> and <unk> – as a reworking of the Bee Gees ' 1966 hit of the same name . Johns also collaborated with then @-@ wife Natalie Imbruglia on her Counting Down the Days album , released in April 2005 . 
 Joannou worked with blues @-@ rock group The Mess Hall , he co @-@ produced – with Matt Lovell – their six @-@ track extended play Feeling Sideways which was released in May 2003 . The album was nominated for the ARIA Award for ' Best Independent Release ' in 2003 . Joannou and Lovell co @-@ produced The Mess Hall 's studio album , Notes from a Ceiling which was issued in June 2005 . Joannou and Lovell received a nomination at the ARIA Music Awards of 2005 for ' Producer of the Year ' . In 2003 , Gillies formed Tambalane with Wes Carr , initially as a song @-@ writing project , they released a self @-@ titled album in 2005 and toured Australia . 
 The 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami resulted in the WaveAid fund @-@ raising concert held in January 2005 : Silverchair performed to help raise funds for aid organisations working in disaster affected areas . As a result of WaveAid the band decided to resume working together . Gillies explained the band 's reunion as due to a special " chemistry " between band members , telling The Sydney Morning Herald , " It only took us 15 years , but recently we 've realised , ' We 've really got something special and we should just go for it . ' " 
 = = = Return from hiatus ( 2006 – 2010 ) = = = 
 After performing at Wave Aid , Silverchair reunited and by late 2005 began preparations for their next studio album , Young Modern . Johns had written about 50 songs during the hiatus for a possible solo album or other project but decided to use them for Silverchair . In 2006 , after five weeks practice the group demoed tracks in the Hunter Region , and then recorded at Los Angeles ' Seedy Underbelly Studios with Launay as producer . Parks again arranged orchestral tracks for the band – they travelled to Prague to record with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra . The group also used Mac , Luke Steele ( The Sleepy Jackson ) and Julian Hamilton ( The Presets , The Dissociatives ) – Hamilton also co @-@ wrote songs with Johns . Silverchair self @-@ funded the album 's production to ease the pressures faced previously when working with a record label . 
 The band toured extensively before releasing the album , performing at Homebake and numerous other shows . Both Mac and Hamilton joined the tour as auxiliary members providing keyboards . In October , they performed a cover of Midnight Oil 's 1981 single , " Don 't Wanna Be the One " , at the ARIA Music Awards of 2006 as part of that band 's induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame . During the performance Johns spray @-@ painted " PG 4 PM " ( Peter Garrett for Prime Minister ) on a stage wall , paying tribute to that band 's front @-@ man , then a Federal Member of Parliament and Minister for the Environment , Heritage and the Arts . 
 Young Modern was released in March 2007 , as was the first single , " Straight Lines " . Three more singles , " Reflections of a Sound " , " If You Keep Losing Sleep " , and " Mind Reader " , were subsequently released . Young Modern became the fifth Silverchair album to top the ARIA Albums chart – they became the first artists to have five number @-@ one albums . " Straight Lines " also became the band 's third No. 1 single in Australia . In June , Silverchair and fellow rock group Powderfinger announced the Across the Great Divide Tour . The tour promoted the efforts of Reconciliation Australia in mending the 17 @-@ year gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non @-@ Indigenous children . Support acts on the tour were John Butler , Missy Higgins , Kev Carmody , Troy Cassar @-@ Daley , Clare Bowditch and Deborah Conway . 
 Young Modern and " Straight Lines " each won three awards at the ARIA Music Awards of 2007 , taking Silverchair 's total to 20 . The group also won three APRA Awards for their song " Straight Lines " , including Songwriter of the Year , which Johns was awarded for a record third time . At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008 both Silverchair and Powderfinger won ' Best Music DVD ' for Across the Great Divide , for Silverchair this was their 21st win from 49 nominations . 
 According to Silverchair 's website , as of June 2009 , the group had begun work on the follow @-@ up to Young Modern , they had spent three weeks recording in Australia with future sessions earmarked for later that year . No release date was set , but the band uploaded in @-@ studio videos of them working on several tracks to their official website . In December , Johns called in to Triple J 's breakfast show , Robbie , <unk> and The Doctor , and discussed the band 's new album which they were working on in Newcastle . He told them " the main difference is there 's a lot of experimentation with instruments and synths ... I think there 's only guitar on four songs out of fifty so far , " but added the new material is " surprisingly rocky given there 's no guitar . " In April 2010 , via the band 's website , Joannou announced that they would perform two new songs called " 16 " and " Machina <unk> " at May 's Groovin the Moo festival . He said work was progressing well and confirmed there was , as yet , no title for the proposed album and that they were simply referring to it as Album No. 6 . The final concert of the festival was at Bunbury on 15 May . By year 's end , work on the album had stopped as each member pursued other interests . 
 = = = " Indefinite hibernation " ( 2011 – present ) = = = 
 On 25 May 2011 , Silverchair announced an indefinite hiatus : 
 We formed Silverchair nearly 20 years ago when we were just 12 years old . Today we stand by the same rules now as we did back then ... if the band stops being fun and if it 's no longer fulfilling creatively , then we need to stop . [ ... ] Despite our best efforts over the last year or so , it 's become increasingly clear that the spark simply isn 't there between the three of us at the moment . Therefore after much soul searching we wanted to let you know that we 're putting Silverchair into " indefinite hibernation " and we 've decided to each do our own thing for the foreseeable future . 
 Sydney Morning Herald 's music writer , Bernard Zuel , said the band 's use of " indefinite hibernation " was a way to soften the blow of the group 's break @-@ up for fans , he expected future reunions and performances for worthy causes . By June , Gillies was in the final stages of about 12 months of working on his solo album and he said that it was not a continuation of his earlier work with Tambalane . In October , Johns was working on the soundtrack for My Mind 's Own Melody – a short film . In May 2012 Johns recorded the new anthem for Qantas titled ' Atlas . ' It is the first piece of commercial music Johns has composed . 
 The members of Silverchair have stated that they have not ruled out a reunion . Gillies has said that there are plans to release a new Silverchair album , which was almost finished before the hiatus . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 Silverchair are generally classified as an alternative rock and post @-@ grunge band , although their loyalty to specific genres has changed as they have matured . Much of the band 's early grunge and post @-@ grunge work was inspired by Nirvana , Pearl Jam , Soundgarden , Alice in Chains and Black Sabbath . According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane , " <unk> captured the tempo of the times with its mix of Soundgarden / Pearl Jam / Bush post @-@ grunge noise and teenage lyrical angst . " 
 In their early years the perceived stylistic similarities led to Silverchair being derisively dubbed as ' <unk> ' , ' not Soundgarden but <unk> ' or ' Nirvana in Pyjamas ' by the Australian media . The latter is a sarcastic conflated reference to the band 's youth and the popular Australian children 's TV series Bananas in Pyjamas . McFarlane stated " Freak Show and tracks like ' Freak ' were firmly in Nirvana territory with a hint of Led Zeppelin 's Eastern mysticism " . Gillies noted that the band were inspired by the Seattle Sound , as well as The Beatles and The Doors , and were highly impressionable in their youth . Johns admitted that " We were always influenced a lot by Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin it just so happened that we weren 't very good at playing that style of music . So we were put in the whole grunge category because it was such a garage @-@ y , heavy music term . " 
 Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll felt that Johns " had never intended to use his problems for inspiration , but in the end the music was the best way to unburden himself . ' Neon Ballroom ' took six months to record . The album 's passion and musical sophistication proved to the world that silverchair were a force to be reckoned with " . According to 100 Best Australian Albums , by three fellow journalists , John O 'Donnell , Toby Creswell and Craig Mathieson , Neon Ballroom 's lead @-@ in track , " Emotion Sickness " , described Johns ' life in the 1990s and " addressed [ his ] desire to move beyond the imitative sounds of Silverchair 's first two albums ... and create something new and original " . " Ana 's Song ( Open Fire ) " directly focussed on his eating disorder ; " [ it ] became a hit all over the world and opened up for discussion the fact that males could also be affected by anorexia . " 
 Allmusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt Diorama " was a shockingly creative and impressive step forward that showed the band shedding its grunge past and adding horns , strings , and mature lyrics to its arsenal . " Fellow Allmusic reviewer Bradley Torreano noted that " they somehow kept going and kept improving ... Silverchair has grown up and put together a fine mix of orchestral pop and rock on Diorama . " Bernard Zuel described how the Diorama concert tour marked a move from hard rock towards art rock : " they stepped out of the arenas and barns and ' got classy ' ... finally having admitted to harbouring artistic ambition ( a very un @-@ Australian band thing to do ) , they 've proved they have the ability " . 
 In writing Young Modern , Johns tried to make the music sound very simple , despite a complex musical structure . The lyrics were written after the music was created , sometimes as late as the day of recording . As Johns dreads writing lyrics , he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future . Johns is the band 's primary songwriter , and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes , they are key to the band 's overall sound . For that album , Hamilton co @-@ wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award winning " Straight Lines " . Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but " still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements " . He said that much of the band 's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing . Self @-@ producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label . 
 Gillies notes that Silverchair will often " run the risk of losing fans " with their work , and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern . However , he described this as a good thing , describing the fact " that we haven 't been pigeonholed , and people really don 't know what to expect " as one of the attractive elements of the band . Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age , Gillies says the band " appreciate what we 've achieved and what we 've got " in their careers . The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony .

 Frogstomp was described as similar to Nirvana and Pearl Jam ; Erlewine noted that it followed in " the alternative rock tradition " of those bands . Erlewine also stated that " their songwriting abilities aren 't as strong " as those of their peers . However , Rolling Stone claimed that the band had risen above their peers , applauding Johns ' " ragged vocals " . Herald Sun journalist Nue Te Koha praised Frogstomp for " breaking the drought of Australian music making an impact overseas " . However he felt " It is highly debatable whether the three teens have gone to the world with a new sound or something identifiably Australian ... Silverchair 's image and sound are blatantly ... Nirvana meets Pearl Jam " . Nimmervoll disputed Te Koha 's view , " It 's not original , it 's not Australian . Bah , humbug ... It 's just as well Britain didn 't say the same thing when The Beatles reinvented American R & B " . 
 Freak Show saw the band show more of their own musical style , rather than copying others , and thus received more praise for its songwriting than its predecessor . Yahoo ! Music 's Sandy Masuo described the lyrics as " moving " and " emotional " . Johns ' vocal delivery was complemented : his " bittersweet , crackly voice tops the ample power <unk> ... [ he ] hits shivery , emotional notes that convey both sweet idealism and disappointment " . Zuel felt that with this album , the band " have outgrown the jokes , predictions and their own understated teenage ambitions to find they have become ( gasp ! ) career musicians . " 
 In 100 Best Australian Albums ( 2010 ) their third album , Neon Ballroom , was placed at No. 25 according to its authors . Entertainment Weekly approved of the further advancement in Neon Ballroom , commenting on " plush strings on these adult arrangements " . There were once again significant advancements in songwriting ; Johns was described as " furious , motivated , and all grown up " . However , Rolling Stone said the album seemed confused , commenting that Silverchair " can 't decide what they want to do " with their music . Meanwhile , Diorama was seen as an extension of the band 's originality , with its " [ h ] eavy orchestration , unpredictable melodic shifts and a whimsical pop sensibility " . According to PopMatters ' Nikki Tranter , the album stood out in an otherwise dull Australian music market . 
 Allmusic 's Clayton Bolger described Young Modern as an improvement by the band , praising " catchy melodic hooks , inspired lyrical themes , and stunning string arrangements " . He claimed the album was the pinnacle of the band 's development . PopMatters ' Nick Pearson saw the opposite , claiming that " [ o ] nce you reach the level of intellectual maturity where you can tell the difference between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap , you have outgrown Silverchair " . Pearson called the album an attempt to secure a safer territory and assure sales , after the success of past works , calling it more boring than its predecessors . Other reviewers noted influences from cult British band XTC . 
 In July 2009 " Tomorrow " was voted number 33 by the Australian public in Triple J 's Hottest 100 of all time . As of May 2011 , the group have sold in excess of six million albums . At the annual ARIA Music Awards , Silverchair holds the record for the most nominated artist , with 49 , and the most number of awards won , with 21 . Their breakthrough year was in 1995 , when they won five out of nine nominations , including ' Best New Talent ' , and ' Breakthrough Artist ' for both album and single categories . Their most successful year was at the 2007 ceremony when they won six of eight nominations .
