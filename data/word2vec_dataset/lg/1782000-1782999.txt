 Bismuth oxychloride ( BiOCl , see figure at right ) and bismuth <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> appear as simple anionic salts of the <unk> ( III ) cation ( BiO + ) which commonly occurs in aqueous bismuth compounds . However , in the case of BiOCl , the salt crystal forms in a structure of alternating plates of Bi , O , and Cl atoms , with each oxygen coordinating with four bismuth atoms in the adjacent plane . This mineral compound is used as a pigment and cosmetic ( see below ) .

 Unlike earlier members of group 15 elements such as nitrogen , phosphorus , and arsenic , and similar to the previous group 15 element antimony , bismuth does not form a stable hydride . Bismuth hydride , <unk> ( BiH 
 3 ) , is an endothermic compound that spontaneously decomposes at room temperature . It is stable only below − 60 ° C. <unk> are intermetallic compounds between bismuth and other metals . 
 In 2014 researchers discovered that sodium <unk> can exist as a form of matter called a “ three @-@ dimensional topological Dirac semi @-@ metal ” ( 3DTDS ) that possess 3D Dirac fermions in bulk . It is a natural , three @-@ dimensional counterpart to graphene with similar electron mobility and velocity . <unk> and topological insulators ( such as those in 3DTDS ) are both crystalline materials that are electrically insulating inside but conducting on the surface , allowing them to function as transistors and other electronic devices . While sodium <unk> ( Na 
 <unk> ) is too unstable to be used in devices without packaging , it can demonstrate potential applications of 3DTDS systems , which offer distinct efficiency and fabrication advantages over planar graphene in semiconductor and spintronics applications .

 <unk> − 
 8 anions . The Bi5 + 
 9 cation has a distorted tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry , and is also found in Bi

 4 units . BiI decomposes upon heating to the triiodide , BiI

 In the Earth 's crust , bismuth is about twice as abundant as gold . The most important ores of bismuth are <unk> and <unk> . Native bismuth is known from Australia , Bolivia , and China . 
 According to the United States Geological Survey , the world mining production of bismuth in 2014 was 13 @,@ 600 tonnes , with the major contributions from China ( 7 @,@ 600 tonnes ) , Vietnam ( 4 @,@ 950 tonnes ) and Mexico ( 948 tonnes ) . The refinery production in 2010 was 16 @,@ 000 tonnes , of which China produced 13 @,@ 000 , Mexico 850 and Belgium 800 tonnes . The difference reflects bismuth 's status as a byproduct of extraction of other metals such as lead , copper , tin , molybdenum and tungsten . 
 Bismuth travels in crude lead bullion ( which can contain up to 10 % bismuth ) through several stages of refining , until it is removed by the Kroll @-@ Betterton process which separates the impurities as slag , or the electrolytic Betts process . Bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals , copper . The raw bismuth metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals , foremost lead . By reacting the molten mixture with chlorine gas the metals are converted to their chlorides while bismuth remains unchanged . Impurities can also be removed by various other methods for example with fluxes and treatments yielding high @-@ purity bismuth metal ( over 99 % Bi ) . World bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic . 
 = = = Price = = = 
 The price for pure bismuth metal has been relatively stable through most of the 20th century , except for a spike in the 1970s . Bismuth has always been produced mainly as a byproduct of lead refining , and thus the price , usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand . 
 Demand for bismuth was small prior to World War II and was pharmaceutical – bismuth compounds were used to treat such conditions as digestive disorders , sexually transmitted diseases and burns . Minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire . During World War II bismuth was considered a strategic material , used for solders , fusible alloys , medications and atomic research . To stabilize the market , the producers set the price at $ 1 @.@ 25 per pound ( 2 @.@ 75 $ / kg ) during the war and at $ 2 @.@ 25 per pound ( 4 @.@ 96 $ / kg ) from 1950 until 1964 . 
 In the early 1970s , the price rose rapidly as a result of increasing demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium , iron and steel . This was followed by a decline owing to increased world production , stabilized consumption , and the recessions of 1980 and 1981 – 82 . In 1984 , the price began to climb as consumption increased worldwide , especially in the United States and Japan . In the early 1990s , research began on the evaluation of bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in ceramic glazes , fishing sinkers , food @-@ processing equipment , free @-@ machining brasses for plumbing applications , lubricating greases , and shot for waterfowl hunting . Growth in these areas remained slow during the middle 1990s , in spite of the backing of lead replacement by the US Government , but intensified around 2005 . This resulted in a rapid and continuing increase in price . 
 = = = Recycling = = = 
 Whereas bismuth is most available today as a byproduct , its sustainability is more dependent on recycling . Bismuth is mostly a byproduct of lead smelting , along with silver , zinc , antimony , and other metals , and also of tungsten production , along with molybdenum and tin , and also of copper production . Recycling bismuth is difficult in many of its end uses , primarily because of scattering . 
 Probably the easiest to recycle would be bismuth @-@ containing fusible alloys in the form of larger objects , then larger soldered objects . Half of the world 's solder consumption is in electronics ( i.e. , circuit boards ) . As the soldered objects get smaller or contain little solder or little bismuth , the recovery gets progressively more difficult and less economic , although solder with a higher silver content will be more worthwhile recovering . Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content , perhaps as bismuth <unk> , and then bismuth used in galvanizing and as a free @-@ machining metallurgical additive . 
 Bismuth in uses where it is dispersed most widely include stomach medicines ( bismuth subsalicylate ) , paints ( bismuth vanadate ) on a dry surface , pearlescent cosmetics ( bismuth oxychloride ) , and bismuth @-@ containing bullets that have been fired . The bismuth scattered in these uses is unrecoverable with present technology . 
 The most important sustainability fact about bismuth is its byproduct status , which can either improve sustainability ( i.e. , vanadium or manganese nodules ) or , for bismuth from lead ore , constrain it ; bismuth is constrained . The extent that the constraint on bismuth can be ameliorated or not is going to be tested by the future of the lead storage battery , since 90 % of the world market for lead is in storage batteries for gasoline or diesel @-@ powered motor vehicles . 
 The life @-@ cycle assessment of bismuth will focus on solders , one of the major uses of bismuth , and the one with the most complete information . The average primary energy use for solders is around 200 MJ per kg , with the high @-@ bismuth solder ( 58 % Bi ) only 20 % of that value , and three low @-@ bismuth solders ( 2 % to 5 % Bi ) running very close to the average . The global warming potential averaged 10 to 14 kg carbon dioxide , with the high @-@ bismuth solder about two @-@ thirds of that and the low @-@ bismuth solders about average . The acidification potential for the solders is around 0 @.@ 9 to 1 @.@ 1 kg sulfur dioxide equivalent , with the high @-@ bismuth solder and one low @-@ bismuth solder only one @-@ tenth of the average and the other low @-@ bismuth solders about average . There is very little life @-@ cycle information on other bismuth alloys or compounds . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Bismuth has few commercial applications , none of which is particularly large . Taking the US as an example , 884 tonnes of bismuth were consumed in 2010 , of which 63 % went into chemicals ( including pharmaceuticals , pigments , and cosmetics ) , 26 % into metallurgical additives for casting and galvanizing , 7 % into bismuth alloys , solders and ammunition , and 4 % into research and other uses . 
 Some manufacturers use bismuth as a substitute in equipment for potable water systems such as valves to meet " lead @-@ free " mandates in the U.S. ( starts in 2014 ) . This is a fairly large application since it covers all residential and commercial building construction . 
 In the early 1990s , researchers began to evaluate bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in various applications . 
 = = = Medicines = = = 
 Bismuth is an ingredient in some pharmaceuticals , although the use of some of these substances is declining . 
 Bismuth subsalicylate is used as an <unk> ; it is the active ingredient in such " Pink Bismuth " preparations as Pepto @-@ Bismol , as well as the 2004 reformulation of <unk> . It is also used to treat some other gastro @-@ intestinal diseases . The mechanism of action of this substance is still not well documented , although an <unk> effect ( toxic effect of small doses of heavy metal ions on microbes ) may be involved in at least some cases . Salicylic acid from hydrolysis of the compound is antimicrobial for <unk> E. coli , an important pathogen in traveler 's diarrhea . 
 a combination of bismuth subsalicylate and bismuth <unk> is used to treat the bacteria causing peptic ulcers . 
 <unk> is an organic bismuth @-@ containing compound used to treat eye infections . 
 Bismuth <unk> , the active ingredient in <unk> , is used as an internal deodorant to treat <unk> from flatulence ( " gas " ) and feces . 
 Bismuth compounds ( including sodium bismuth tartrate ) were formerly used to treat syphilis 
 " Milk of bismuth " ( an aqueous solution of bismuth hydroxide and bismuth subcarbonate ) was marketed as an alimentary <unk> in the early 20th century 
 Bismuth subnitrate ( <unk> ( OH ) 9 ( NO3 ) 4 ) and bismuth subcarbonate ( <unk> ( CO3 ) ) are also used in medicine .

 The density difference between lead ( density 11 @.@ 32 g · cm − 3 ) and bismuth ( density 9 @.@ 78 g · cm − 3 ) is small enough that for many ballistics and weighting applications , bismuth can substitute for lead . For example , it can replace lead as a dense material in fishing sinkers . It has been used as a replacement for lead in shot , bullets and less @-@ lethal riot gun ammunition . The Netherlands , Denmark , England , Wales , the US , and many other countries now prohibit the use of lead shot for the hunting of wetland birds , as many birds are prone to lead poisoning owing to mistaken ingestion of lead ( instead of small stones and grit ) to aid digestion , or even prohibit the use of lead for all hunting , such as in the Netherlands . Bismuth @-@ tin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead . ( Another less expensive but also more poorly performing alternative is " steel " shot , which is actually soft iron . ) Bismuth 's lack of malleability does , however , make it unsuitable for use in expanding hunting bullets . 
 Bismuth , as a dense element of high atomic weight , is used in bismuth @-@ impregnated latex shields to shield from X @-@ ray in medical examinations , such as <unk> , mostly as it is considered non @-@ toxic . 
 The European Union 's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive ( RoHS ) for reduction of lead has broadened bismuth 's use in electronics as a component of low @-@ melting point solders , as a replacement for traditional tin @-@ lead solders . Its low toxicity will be especially important for solders to be used in food processing equipment and copper water pipes , although it can also be used in other applications including those in the automobile industry , in the EU for example . 
 Bismuth has been evaluated as a replacement for lead in free @-@ machining brasses for plumbing applications , although it does not equal the performance of leaded steels . 
 = = = = Other metal uses and specialty alloys = = = = 
 Many bismuth alloys have low melting points and are found in specialty applications such as solders . Many automatic sprinklers , electric fuses , and safety devices in fire detection and suppression systems contain the eutectic <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> alloy that melts at 47 ° C ( 117 ° F ) This is a convenient temperature since it is unlikely to be exceeded in normal living conditions . Low @-@ melting alloys , such as Bi @-@ Cd @-@ Pb @-@ Sn alloy which melts at 70 ° C , are also used in automotive and aviation industries . Before deforming a thin @-@ walled metal part , it is filled with a melt or covered with a thin layer of the alloy to reduce the chance of breaking . Then the alloy is removed by submerging the part in boiling water . 
 Bismuth is used to make free @-@ machining steels and free @-@ machining aluminium alloys for precision machining properties . It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining . The shrinking on solidification in lead and the expansion of bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities . Similarly , alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and exhibit a very small change ( on the order 0 @.@ 01 % ) upon melting , solidification or aging . Such alloys are used in high @-@ precision casting , e.g. in dentistry , to create models and molds . Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material . 
 Bismuth is also used in Aluminum @-@ Silicon cast alloys in order to refine Si morphology . However , it indicated a poisoning effect on modification of strontium ( Sr ) . Some bismuth alloys , such as <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , are combined with non @-@ sticking materials such as mica , glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts . Addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the quantum yield of Cs cathodes . <unk> of bismuth and manganese powders at 300 ° C produces a permanent magnet and magnetostrictive material , which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the 10 – 100 kHz range and in magnetic memory devices .

 Scientific literature concurs that bismuth and most of its compounds are less toxic compared to other heavy metals ( lead , antimony , etc . ) and that it is not <unk> . They have low solubilities in the blood , are easily removed with urine , and showed no carcinogenic , mutagenic or teratogenic effects in long @-@ term tests on animals ( up to 2 years ) . Its biological half @-@ life for whole @-@ body retention is 5 days but it can remain in the kidney for years in patients treated with bismuth compounds . 
 Bismuth poisoning exists and mostly affects the kidney , liver , and bladder . Skin and respiratory irritation can also follow exposure to respective organs . As with lead , overexposure to bismuth can result in the formation of a black deposit on the gingiva , known as a bismuth line . 
 Bismuth 's environmental impacts are not very well known . It is considered that its environmental impact is small , due in part to the low solubility of its compounds . Limited information however means that a close eye should be kept on its impact .

 = Wood Badge = 
 Wood Badge is a Scouting leadership programme and the related award for adult leaders in the programmes of Scout associations throughout the world . Wood Badge courses aim to make Scouters better leaders by teaching advanced leadership skills , and by creating a bond and commitment to the Scout movement . Courses generally have a combined classroom and practical outdoors @-@ based phase followed by a Wood Badge ticket , also known as the project phase . By " working the ticket " , participants put their newly gained experience into practice to attain ticket goals aiding the Scouting movement . The first Wood Badge training was organized by Francis " Skipper " Gidney and lectured at by Robert Baden @-@ Powell and others at Gilwell Park ( United Kingdom ) in September 1919 . Wood Badge training has since spread across the world with international variations . 
 On completion of the course , participants are awarded the Wood Badge beads to recognize significant achievement in leadership and direct service to young people . The pair of small wooden beads , one on each end of a leather thong ( string ) , is worn around the neck as part of the Scout uniform . The beads are presented together with a taupe neckerchief bearing a tartan patch of the Maclaren clan , honoring William de Bois Maclaren , who donated the £ 7000 to purchase Gilwell Park in 1919 plus an additional £ 3000 for improvements to the house that was on the estate . The neckerchief with the braided leather woggle ( neckerchief slide ) denotes the membership of the 1st Gilwell Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1 . Recipients of the Wood Badge are known as Wood Badgers or Gilwellians .

 Soon after founding the Scout movement , Robert Baden @-@ Powell saw the need for leader training . Early Scoutmaster training camps were held in London and Yorkshire . Baden @-@ Powell wanted practical training in the outdoors in campsites . World War I delayed the development of leader training , so the first formal Wood Badge course was not offered until 1919 . Gilwell Park , just outside London , was purchased specifically to provide a venue for the course and the Opening Ceremonies were held on July 26 , 1919 . Francis Gidney , the first Camp Chief at Gilwell Park , conducted the first Wood Badge course there from September 8 – 19 , 1919 . It was produced by Percy Everett , the Commissioner of Training , and Baden @-@ Powell himself gave lectures . The course was attended by 18 participants , and other lecturers . After this first course , Wood Badge training continued at Gilwell Park , and it became the home of leadership training in the Scout movement . 
 = = = Modern curriculum = = = 
 The main goals of a Wood Badge course are to : 
 Recognize the contemporary leadership concepts utilized in the corporate world and leading governmental organizations that are relevant to Scouting 's values . 
 Apply the skills one learns from participating as a member of a successful working team . 
 View Scouting globally , as a family of interrelated , values @-@ based programmes that provide age @-@ appropriate activities for youth . 
 <unk> the leader 's commitment by sharing in an inspirational experience that helps provide Scouting with the leadership it needs to accomplish its mission . 
 Generally , a Wood Badge course consists of classroom work , a series of self @-@ study modules , outdoor training , and the Wood Badge " ticket " or " project " . Classroom and outdoor training are often combined and taught together , and occur over one or more weeks or weekends . As part of completing this portion of the course , participants must write their tickets . 
 The exact curriculum varies from country to country , but the training generally includes both theoretical and experiential learning . All course participants are introduced to the 1st Gilwell Scout group or Gilwell Scout Troop 1 ( the latter name is used in the Boy Scouts of America and some other countries ) . In the Boy Scouts of America , they are also assigned to one of the traditional Wood Badge " critter " patrols . Instructors deliver training designed to strengthen the patrols . One @-@ on @-@ one work with an assigned troop guide helps each participant to reflect on what he has learned , so that he can better prepare an individualized " ticket " . This part of the training program gives the adult Scouter the opportunity to assume the role of a Scout joining the original " model " troop , to learn firsthand how a troop ideally operates . The locale of all initial training is referred to as Gilwell Field , no matter its geographical location . 
 = = = Ticket = = = 
 The phrase ' working your ticket ' comes from a story attributed in Scouting legend to Baden @-@ Powell : Upon completion of a British soldier 's service in India , he had to pay the cost of his ticket home . The most affordable way for a soldier to return was to engineer a progression of assignments that were successively closer to home . 
 Part of the transformative power of the Wood Badge experience is the effective use of metaphor and tradition to reach both heart and mind . In most Scout associations , " working your ticket " is the culmination of Wood Badge training . Participants apply themselves and their new knowledge and skills to the completion of items designed to strengthen the individual 's leadership and the home unit 's organizational resilience in a project or " ticket " . The ticket consists of specific goals that must be accomplished within a specified time , often 18 months due to the large amount of work involved . Effective tickets require much planning and are approved by the Wood Badge course staff before the course phase ends . Upon completion of the ticket , a participant is said to have earned his way back to Gilwell .

 After completion of the Wood Badge course , participants are awarded the insignia in a Wood Badge bead ceremony . They receive automatic membership in 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1 . These leaders are henceforth called Gilwellians or Wood Badgers . It is estimated that worldwide over 100 @,@ 000 Scouters have completed their Wood Badge training . The 1st Gilwell Scout Group meets annually during the first weekend in September at Gilwell Park for the Gilwell Reunion . Gilwell Reunions are also held in other places , often on that same weekend .

 The Gilwell woggle is a two @-@ strand version of a Turk 's head knot , which has no beginning and no end , and symbolizes the commitment of a Wood Badger to Scouting . In some countries , Wood Badge training is divided into more than one part and the Gilwell woggle is given for completion of Wood Badge Part I. 
 = = = Beads = = = 
 The beads were first presented at the initial leadership course in September 1919 at Gilwell Park . 
 The origins of Wood Badge beads can be traced back to 1888 , when Baden @-@ Powell was on a military campaign in Zululand ( now part of South Africa ) . He pursued Dinuzulu , son of Cetshwayo , a Zulu king , for some time , but never managed to catch up with him . Dinuzulu was said to have had a 12 @-@ foot ( 4 m ) -long necklace with more than a thousand acacia beads . Baden @-@ Powell is claimed to have found the necklace when he came to Dinuzulu 's deserted mountain stronghold . Such necklaces were known as <unk> in Zulu and were presented to brave warrior leaders . Other sources suggest that what Baden @-@ Powell actually found were a Zulu girl 's marriage dowry beads . 
 Much later , Baden @-@ Powell sought a distinctive award for the participants in the first Gilwell course . He constructed the first award using two beads from the necklace he had recovered , and threaded them onto a leather thong given by an elderly South African in Mafeking , calling it the Wood Badge . 
 While no official knot exists for tying the two ends of the thong together , the decorative diamond knot has become the most common . When produced , the thong is joined by a simple overhand knot and various region specific traditions have arisen around tying the diamond knot , including : having a fellow course member tie it ; having a mentor or course leader tie it ; and having the recipient tie it after completing some additional activity that shows he or she has mastered the skills taught to him or her during training . 
 = = = = Significance of additional beads = = = = 
 Additional beads are awarded to Wood Badgers who serve as part of a Wood Badge training team . One additional bead is awarded to each Assistant Leader Trainer ( Wood Badge staff ) and two additional beads are awarded to each Leader Trainer ( Wood Badge course directors ) , for a total of four . 
 As part of a tradition , five beads may be worn by the " Deputy Camp Chiefs of Gilwell " . The Deputy Camp Chiefs are usually the personnel of National Scout Associations in charge of Wood Badge training . The fifth bead symbolizes the Camp Chief 's position as an official representative of Gilwell Park , and his or her function in maintaining the global integrity of Wood Badge training . William Hillcourt is one person who wore five beads . 
 The founder of the Scouting movement , Robert Baden @-@ Powell , wore six beads , as did Sir Percy Everett , then Deputy Chief Scout and the Chief 's right hand . Baden @-@ Powell 's beads are on display at Baden @-@ Powell House in London . Everett endowed his six beads to be worn by the Camp Chief of Gilwell as a badge of office . Since that time the wearer of the sixth bead has generally been the director of leader training at Gilwell Park . 
 = = = 1st Gilwell Scout Group neckerchief = = = 
 The neckerchief is a universal symbol of Scouting and its Maclaren tartan represents Wood Badge 's ties to Gilwell Park . The neckerchief , called a " <unk> " in British and some Commonwealth Scouting associations , is a standard triangular scarf made of cotton or wool twill with a taupe face and red back ; a patch of Clan MacLaren tartan is affixed near the point . The pattern was adopted in honor of a British Scout commissioner who , as a descendant of the Scottish MacLaren clan , donated money for the Gilwell Park property on which the first Wood Badge program was held . 
 Originally , the neckerchief was made entirely of triangular pieces of the tartan , but its expense forced the adoption of the current design . The neckerchief is often worn with the Gilwell woggle . 
 = = = Axe and Log = = = 
 The axe and log logo was conceived by the first Camp Chief , Francis Gidney , in the early 1920s to distinguish Gilwell Park from the Scout Headquarters . Gidney wanted to associate Gilwell Park with the outdoors and Scoutcraft rather than the business or administrative Headquarters offices . Scouters present at the original Wood Badge courses regularly saw axe blades masked for safety by being buried in a log . Seeing this , Gidney chose the axe and log as the totem of Gilwell Park . 
 = = = Other symbols = = = 
 The kudu horn is another Wood Badge symbol . Baden @-@ Powell first encountered the kudu horn at the Battle of Shangani , where he discovered how the Matabele warriors used it to quickly spread a signal of alarm . He used the horn at the first Scout encampment at Brownsea Island in 1907 . It is used from the early Wood Badge courses to signal the beginning of the course or an activity , and to inspire Scouters to always do better . 
 The grass fields at the back of the White House at Gilwell Park are known as the Training Ground and The Orchard , and are where Wood Badge training was held from the early years onward . A large oak , known as the Gilwell Oak , separates the two fields . The Gilwell Oak symbol is associated with Wood Badge , although the beads for the Wood Badge have never been made of this oak . 
 Wolf Cub leaders briefly followed a separate training system beginning in 1922 , in which they were awarded the Akela Badge on completion . The badge was a single fang on a leather thong . Wolf Cub Leader Trainers wore two fangs . The Akela Badge was discontinued in 1925 , and all leaders were awarded the Wood Badge on completion of their training . Very few of the fangs issued as Akela Badges can now be found .

 = Æthelbert of York = 
 Æthelbert ( sometimes Æthelberht , Albert , <unk> , Aethelberht , or <unk> ; died 8 November 780 ) was an eighth century scholar , teacher , and Archbishop of York . Related to his predecessor at York , he became a monk at an early age and was in charge of the cathedral 's library and school before becoming archbishop . He taught a number of missionaries and scholars , including Alcuin , at the school . While archbishop Æthelbert rebuilt the cathedral and sent missionaries to the Continent . Æthelbert retired before his death , and during his retirement built another church in York . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Æthelbert , was the teacher and intimate friend of Alcuin , whose poem on the saints and prelates of the Church of York , Versus de <unk> <unk> et de Sanctis et <unk> <unk> <unk> , is the principal source of information concerning Æthelbert 's life . He was a kinsman of his predecessor Ecgbert , who was brother to Eadberht , King of Northumbria . Æthelbert 's family placed him in a monastery as a young child , where he was a pupil in the school founded at York by Ecgbert . Ecgbert ordained Æthelbert as a priest put him in charge of the school . 
 Æthelbert was instrumental in forming a library at York , which was probably the largest contemporary collection of books to be found in Europe outside of Rome . Alcuin mentions several Latin and Greek classical authors , as well as the Fathers and other Christian writers that formed the 8th century canon . Æthelbert , in his search for books , travelled far , and we know that he visited Rome among other places . Alcuin 's poem Versus lists 41 different authors , including some who wrote in Hebrew . He taught both the trivium as well as the quadrivium , plus how to figure the dates of church festivals and natural science . 
 = = Archbishop = = 
 In 766 Æthelbert succeeded Ecgbert as archbishop ; he was consecrated 24 April 767 , the feast day of his predecessor Wilfrid . This may have been deliberate and a sign that Æthelbert wished to revive Wilfrid 's ambitions for the archiepiscopal see . Æthelbert received his pallium from Pope Adrian I in 773 . Alcuin was appointed head of the cathedral school after Æthelbert became archbishop . Much of Alcuin 's description of Æthelbert 's time as archbishop has the flavour of a panegyric , as Alcuin praised Æthelbert as a model bishop suitable for other bishops to use as a role model . 
 Æthelbert rebuilt York Minster , which had been destroyed by fire in 741 , giving Eanbald and Alcuin the job of overseeing the construction . Alcuin wrote that it had bright windows and ceilings and that the liturgical vessels and altars were decorated with precious metals and gems . The new building also had 30 altars as well as upper apartments . Æthelbert dedicated one of the altars to Saint Paul and it was located on the location where Edwin , the first Christian king of Northumbria , was baptized . 
 Æthelbert sent out missionaries to the pagans of Northern Europe , among them <unk> and <unk> , who went to northern Germany . <unk> had earlier been a pupil at the school in York , and went on to become the first Bishop of Munster . Æthelbert was the recipient of letters from one of the missionaries - Lull , the Archbishop of Mainz , assuming that Lull 's correspondent " <unk> " , who is an archbishop and who was being asked for the works of Bede , is actually Æthelbert , as most historians seem convinced of . Books were sent to the missionaries from the York library . 
 In 774 , Æthelbert called a council which deposed Alhred the King of Northumbria and sent the ex @-@ king north into exile with the Picts . The cause of the deposition may have been related to missionary work . The historian D. P. Kirby feels that Æthelbert was not a supporter of Alhred prior to his deposition . Alhred was replaced with Æthelred , who was replaced in 778 by Ælfwald , the son of <unk> . Kirby sees Æthelbert 's withdrawal of support as instrumental in the deposition of Æthelred , noting that Ælfwald was closely related to Æthelbert , unlike both Alhred and Æthelred . Kirby also notes that medieval chroniclers noted that Æthelbert is said to have not " spared evil kings " . 
 = = Retirement and death = = 
 Æthelbert retired some time before his death , consecrating Eanbald as his successor . The exact date this occurred is unclear . Alcuin gives a date corresponding to July 778 , but it could be 777 too . Eanbald 's position may have just been as an associate bishop , with Æthelbert remaining in office until his death while sharing the office with Eanbald . During his retirement , he had constructed a new church dedicated to Alma Sophia . He lived long enough to consecrate the new church , ten days before his death on 8 November .

 = Calabozos = 
 Calabozos is a Holocene caldera in central Chile 's Maule Region ( 7th Region ) . Part of the Chilean Andes ' volcanic segment , it is considered a member of the Southern Volcanic Zone ( SVZ ) , one of the three distinct volcanic belts of South America . This most active section of the Andes runs along central Chile 's western edge , and includes more than 70 of Chile 's stratovolcanoes and volcanic fields . Calabozos lies in an extremely remote area of poorly glaciated mountains . 
 Calabozos and the majority of the Andean volcanoes formed from the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere . The caldera is in a transitional region between thick and thin lithosphere , and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma . It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic sedimentary rock ( rock formed within the Earth ) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and metamorphic rock . 
 Calabozos is responsible for the huge Loma Seca Tuff , a body of material 200 cubic kilometres ( 48 cu mi ) to 500 cubic kilometres ( 120 cu mi ) in volume . It accumulated over at least three eruptive periods , beginning 800 @,@ 000 years ago ( 0 @.@ 8 mya ) and lasting until 150 @,@ 000 years ago ( 0 @.@ 15 mya ) . 
 The caldera 's dimensions are 26 kilometres ( 16 mi ) by 14 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) , and it has an elevation of 3 @,@ 508 metres ( 11 @,@ 509 ft ) . Activity from the caldera has produced many other stratovolcanoes to form a complex volcano . 
 = = Geography and structure = = 
 Calabozos lies in central Chile 's Maule Region , near Curicó and Talca , on the western Andes . This is an area of poorly glaciated mountains that is not permanently populated . There are no roads , and it is only accessible via horse or on foot . 
 Calabozos is part of the South Volcanic Zone , which runs along the western edge of central Chile and extends south , jumping the border to continue its course in Argentina . This range includes at least nine caldera complexes , more than 70 of Chile 's stratovolcanoes and volcanic fields that have been active in the Quaternary , and hundreds of minor eruptive centers . The South Volcanic Zone is the most volcanically active region in Chile , and produces around one eruption per year . Its largest historical eruption was at Quizapu Crater , located 15 kilometres ( 9 mi ) to 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) from the north side of Cerro Azul 's summit , and its most active volcanoes are Llaima and Villarrica . 
 Calabozos is a ring @-@ shaped caldera 26 kilometres ( 16 mi ) by 14 kilometres ( 9 mi ) wide , with an elevation of 3 @,@ 508 metres ( 11 @,@ 509 ft ) . Volcanoes have been formed by eruptions in the crater . The largest , which is on the southern rim of the caldera , is the Holocene Cerro del Medio complex with an elevation of 3 @,@ 508 metres ( 11 @,@ 509 ft ) . It is made mainly of andesite and dacite , and has a volume of 20 cubic kilometres ( 5 cu mi ) to 25 cubic kilometres ( 6 cu mi ) . On the southwestern edge several eruptions have created the Descabezado Chico volcano ( elevation : 3 @,@ 250 metres ( 10 @,@ 663 ft ) ) which consists of four overlapping volcanic craters . The last eruption occurred during Holocene time , and produced a dacitic lava flow ( 2 @.@ 5 cubic kilometres ( 1 cu mi ) in volume ) that extends for 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) . Cerro Colorado , with an elevation of 2 @,@ 928 metres ( 9 @,@ 606 ft ) , forms another cone in the complex . 
 Towards the center of the caldera , hot springs including Cajon Los Calabozos and Baños de <unk> are present . The springs are as old as 0 @.@ 3 mya , and may have formed directly after Calabozos 's second eruption as a result of uplift caused by re @-@ occurring activity in the caldera . The vents occur in two clusters , Colorado and Puesto Calabozos , and are located along the margin of a fault at the southwestern edge of the caldera . Hildreth et al . ( 1983 ) evaluated that Calabozos could potentially be useful for the harvesting of geothermal energy . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Subduction of the eastern edge of the Nazca Plate under the western edge of the South American Plate occurs about 160 kilometers ( 99 mi ) west of Peru and Chile , at a rate of 9 to 11 centimetres ( 4 in ) per year at 30 degrees south latitude . This subduction process has resulted in the formation of the Peru – Chile Trench , an oceanic trench in the Pacific Ocean . It also produced the Andean Volcanic Belt and the rest of the Andes . 
 Calabozos is one of 44 Holocene epoch volcanoes located in central Chile and Argentina . It is included within the Southern Volcanic Zone , the most active section of the Chilean Andes . The date of its last known eruption is not known with precision , though it took place during the Holocene . 
 Through K @-@ Ar dating , geologist Robert Edward Drake established the age of 66 events in central Chile , and divided them into groups based on the time of their origin . In a paper published in 1976 , he described the location of each group and the west @-@ east @-@ trending movement of volcanism in the range . To the west of the Chilean Andes are an early group of eruptions , dated from the Oligocene and the Early Miocene ( 33 @.@ 3 – 20 @.@ 2 mya ) . The scale of the eruptive events that produced these features remains unclear . Further east , in the actual range , are huge numbers of eruptions . Between 15 @.@ 3 and 6 @.@ 4 mya , widespread volcanism took place , followed by extensive folding ; this process then repeated itself from 18 @.@ 4 to 13 @.@ 7 mya during the Miocene . Beginning 6 @.@ 4 mya the Chilean Andes were quiet , though whether or not this quiet period took place throughout all of the Andes remains unknown . Central Chilean volcanoes became active once again around 2 @.@ 5 mya , and have erupted almost continuously since . 
 = = = Local = = = 
 Calabozos lies in an area between thick and thin continental crust , and its eruptions are probably fed from a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera . The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic sedimentary rock from the Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age , over a layer of Precambrian @-@ Triassic sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons ( magma intrusions ) . Under its northeast edge , Calabozos is cut by a north @-@ south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates . 
 Calabozos is similar in age to Cerro Azul and Descabezado Grande , and its eruptions may correspond to past activity at both volcanoes . Eruption products of very similar composition ( including mafic andesite , <unk> , and dacite ) make up the volcanoes . There is also a similarity in size ( all are between 40 and 70 cubic kilometers in volume ) . 
 The volcano appears to be part of a north @-@ south trending group of rhyolitic , silicic Quaternary volcanoes ( including <unk> Volcanic Field , Laguna del Maule , and Volcán <unk> ) that veers off the north @-@ northeast direction of the rest of the Andes . The directional formation of this belt corresponds to the fold @-@ and @-@ thrust movement of the nearby <unk> fault , which formed in the Tertiary and remained active until the early Pliocene or late Miocene . This may suggest that Calabozos ' activity is more dependent on local processes than subduction of the Nazca Plate . 
 = = = Geologic record = = = 
 In comparison to the well @-@ preserved rocks of the dry , central part of the Andes , the record that defines the southern sector is poorly preserved . Remnants of Miocene and Quaternary eruptions within the central part are clearly preserved in the rock record . Ash flow sheets constitute as much as 40 percent of the area 's total erupted material , suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time . By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes , Hildreth et al. concluded that similar amounts of ash @-@ flow volcanism took place in the southern sector as well . Their study established that in particular silicic ash was missing from the record , and concluded that erosion had probably disrupted deposition of volcaniclastic rock . 
 While the volcanic history of the area extends back far further , the earliest fully recognizable events in the region are recorded in the pyroclastic <unk> Formation . This sequence appears to begin at Laguna de la Invernada and ranges from 15 to 6 mya . Remnants of magma intrusions as young as 7 mya can be found at the lake ( Laguna de la Invernada ) . 
 The most recent volcanic phase began about 4 mya , producing largely andesitic eruptions . A series of eruptions built up a broad plateau of lava , and extended over the area where Calabozos now lies . Locally , this plateau was composed of mafic andesite with olivine , which over time gathered to form 300 @-@ metre ( 1 @,@ 000 ft ) to 500 @-@ metre ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) thick layers . Nearby volcanoes sit on top of two mya lavas that formed during this period , while the Loma Seca Tuff lies atop andesitic deposits from Descabezado Grande . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 Calabozos lies between two different types of volcanism — to its north , andesite and rhyolite are the primary constituents of lava while its southern neighbors are composed of more mafic andesite and basalt . It is mainly basaltic andesite and rhyodacite that make up Calabozos , forming a <unk> suite rich with potassium . Its lavas are dotted with phenocrysts , which vary from 2 to 25 percent of their mass . These phenocrysts are typically made of plagioclase , but also contain clinopyroxene , orthopyroxene , ilmenite , apatite , and <unk> . 
 = = Climate and vegetation = = 
 The area 's rainfall averages 134 centimetres ( 53 in ) annually , varying from 50 centimetres ( 20 in ) at its lowest to 225 centimetres ( 89 in ) at its highest . Precipitation between May and August ( primarily snow ) is normally 20 to 35 centimetres , dropping to below one centimetre during summer . Temperature is also variable , typically registering 25 degrees Celsius during the summer , but dropping below freezing at high elevations ( above 2 @,@ 500 metres ( 8 @,@ 200 ft ) ) . 
 Vegetation is rare in the area . The 1932 eruption of Cerro Azul 's Quizapu Crater reduced much of the land to a pumice desert . Above 1 @,@ 200 metres ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) , vegetation becomes even more sparse . 
 = = Eruptive history = = 
 During the late Pleistocene , Calabozos erupted tuff composed primarily of rhyodacite and dacite . Three distinct eruptions have taken place within the last million years . The sheets of remaining ash left over from all of the eruptions together range from 200 cubic kilometres ( 48 cu mi ) to 500 cubic kilometres ( 120 cu mi ) in volume and are known as the Loma Seca Tuff . 
 The first eruption , which took place 0 @.@ 8 mya , was distinct from later eruptions in that its product lacks flattened <unk> ( lens @-@ shaped layers of mineral or rock embedded in rock ) . The tuff is dotted with predominantly plagioclase phenocrysts , which make up between less than 5 to approximately 15 percent of each particle 's mass . After being erupted , the material settled in canyons , where it underwent glaciation . This carved cliffs which drop as much as 100 metres ( 328 ft ) . The tuff is limited to just a few kilometers around the complex . 
 Taking place 0 @.@ 3 mya , the second eruption was the most extensive . It was probably between 250 cubic kilometres ( 60 cu mi ) and 300 cubic kilometres ( 72 cu mi ) in volume and extended past the reaches of the caldera , down the adjacent foothills . Beyond the caldera , the eruptive products are poor in phenocrysts ( unlike those of the first eruption ) . They are instead rich in lithic material , which makes up as much as 10 percent of the rock in parts ( 50 percent at the base of the caldera ) . As the first of the ash was deposited , it accumulated in layers that formed quickly and resisted erosion , but only partially melded together . However , except for these basal layers and thin zones where the ash was <unk> ( loses the properties of a glass and becomes brittle ) , the entire sheet is melded together . Inside Calabozos , the ash resisted welding and contains more phenocrysts . Instead , erosion ate away at it , in the form of acid leaching , and broke down much of its pumice content . Still , the rock layer here contains five to 30 percent phenocrysts , and has high levels of <unk> and lithic content . 
 The differences between these two deposits can be accounted for by a few factors , including time of eruption and placement . The material inside the caldera must be younger and erupted from a pool of magma that had larger crystals . Its extensive erosion can be explained by the presence of hydrothermal vents , and its high levels of lithics probably originate from either being exposed to the rocks after they were erupted , lying adjacent to them while they underwent subsidence , or is a result of long , slow formation . Any of these reasons would also effectively account for the poor mixing of the lavas . 
 Activity continued for approximately 150 @,@ 000 years in the form of quiet andesitic eruptions , as glaciation took place . About 0 @.@ 15 mya ( 150 @,@ 000 years ago ) , a third and final ash flow was erupted . With a volume of 175 cubic kilometers ( 42 cu mi ) to 250 cubic kilometres ( 60 cu mi ) , it was smaller than the second eruption , but acted similarly , and had much more densely welded tuff . The ash was thickest at 300 metres ( 984 ft ) , at Loma Seca , and the top of the deposit has undergone erosion . It is densely welded in crevasses , but not at thin 50 metres ( 164 ft ) layers , where much of the material is barely welded or not welded at all . 
 The first layers of the last deposit were alternating belts of light and dark @-@ colored material , and were densely welded . They appear to have been erupted in pulses , and continue for hundreds of meters . Deposition was continuous except for one interruption , which can be seen at proximity to the caldera , where the layers are replaced by thin , <unk> sheets of lava . Another zone of <unk> material , about 20 metres ( 66 ft ) and near Cajon Los Calabozos , underwent no erosion , suggesting that activity stopped , then began again . 
 High in fiamme , the third tuff layer differs from the second in that it has even higher <unk> content , but poor lithics . In the fiamme , phenocrysts constitute between 5 and 15 percent of the rock , increasing to 25 to 30 percent near the caldera . In the younger emplacements , clinopyroxene is evident along with an increase in mafic content . 
 = = Threats and preparedness = = 
 Calabozos is in the South Volcanic Zone , which contains potentially deadly and active volcanoes such as Mount Hudson , Llaima , and Villarrica . Villarrica and Llaima together have more than 80 reported episodes of volcanism since 1558 , and at least 40 South Volcanic Zone volcanoes have had Holocene @-@ age eruptions . 
 Its remoteness means that Calabozos poses little threat to humans , but if necessary relief efforts could be orchestrated . The Volcanic Disaster Assistance Program ( VDAP ) formed in response to the famous eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia and saved lives following the 1991 eruption of Mount Hudson in Chile by organizing evacuations . The team 's stated aim is to " reduce eruption @-@ caused fatalities and economic losses in developing countries " . Made up of various USGS offices such as the Cascades Volcano Observatory ( CVO ) , responsible for monitoring Mount St. Helens , the team has equipment to monitor any volcano , allowing the timely prediction of volcanic eruptions and the evacuation of nearby homes .

 The 2013 Tour de France was the 100th edition of the Tour de France , one of cycling 's Grand Tours . It started on the island of Corsica on 30 June and finished on the Champs @-@ Élysées in Paris on 21 July . The Tour consisted of twenty @-@ one race stages and covered a total distance of 3 @,@ 403 @.@ 5 km ( 2 @,@ 115 mi ) . The race was won by Chris Froome of Team Sky . Second and third respectively were the Nairo Quintana ( Movistar Team ) and the Team Katusha rider , Joaquim Rodríguez . 
 Marcel Kittel ( Argos – Shimano ) was the first rider to wear the race leader 's yellow jersey after winning stage one . He lost the lead the next day to Jan Bakelants of RadioShack – Leopard , who managed to obtain a one @-@ second lead from a late solo attack . Simon Gerrans gained the race lead after his team , Orica – GreenEDGE , won the stage four team time trial . Gerrans passed the lead on to teammate Daryl Impey after the fifth stage . Froome took the lead from Impey after the eighth stage , the first classified as mountainous . Froome maintained his lead for the remainder of the race by consolidating his lead through solid performances in the individual time trials and in the high mountains . 
 Froome became the second consecutive British cyclist to win the Tour de France , after Bradley Wiggins accomplished the feat the year before . In the race 's other classifications , Movistar Team rider Quintana won the mountains classification and also finished as the best young rider in the general classification , finishing in second place overall ; Peter Sagan of the Cannondale team was the winner of the points classification , with Saxo – Tinkoff finishing as the winners of the team classification .

 Twenty @-@ two teams participated in the 2013 edition of the Tour de France . All of the nineteen UCI ProTeams were entitled , and obliged , to enter the race . On 27 April 2013 , the organiser of the Tour , Amaury Sport Organisation ( ASO ) , announced the three second @-@ tier UCI Professional Continental teams given wildcard invitations , all of which were French @-@ based . The presentation of the teams took place at the harbour of Porto @-@ Vecchio on the island of Corsica on 27 June , two days before the opening stage held in the town . Each team arrived by boat to the stage , before being introduced to the crowd . 
 The number of riders allowed per squad was nine , therefore the start list contained a total of 198 riders . From the riders that began this edition , 169 completed the race . The riders came from 34 countries ; France , Spain , Italy , Netherlands , Australia , Belgium and Germany all had 10 or more riders in the race .

 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 In the run up to the 2013 Tour de France , Chris Froome was <unk> considered as the top pre @-@ race favourite for the general classification , with his closest rivals were thought to be Alberto Contador ( Saxo – Tinkoff ) and Joaquim Rodríguez ( Team Katusha ) . Astana 's Vincenzo Nibali was also a possible contender after getting his first Tour podium in 2012 but he had focused on the 2013 Giro d 'Italia . The riders considered outsiders were BMC Racing Team riders Cadel Evans and Tejay van Garderen , Richie Porte ( Team Sky ) , Jurgen Van den Broeck ( Lotto – Belisol ) , Thibaut Pinot ( <unk> ) , Ryder Hesjedal ( Garmin – Sharp ) , Robert Gesink ( <unk> Pro Cycling ) , and Movistar Team riders Alejandro Valverde and Nairo Quintana . 
 The 2012 Tour de France winner , Bradley Wiggins of Team Sky , had focused on the Giro d 'Italia , but retired early due to illness , subsequently pulling out because illness and injury had left him insufficient time to train for the Tour de France and chose not to ride . This left Froome , runner @-@ up in 2012 , the undisputed leader of Team Sky . He had shown his form so far in 2013 season by winning four of the five stage races he had rode : Tour of Oman , Critérium International , Tour de Romandie and Critérium du Dauphiné . Two @-@ time Tour winner ( 2007 and 2009 ) Contador returned to the race having been suspended from the 2012 race ; he had won the 2012 Vuelta a España and his best major result of the season had been second in Oman . Rodríguez had podium finishes in both the Giro and Vuelta in 2012 , as well as winning the UCI World Tour . He had top @-@ ten placings in three major stage races in the season . 
 The sprinters considered favourites for the points classification and wins in bunch sprint finishes were Mark Cavendish ( Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step ) , Peter Sagan ( Cannondale ) , André Greipel ( Lotto – Belisol ) , Matthew Goss ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) and Argos – Shimano riders Marcel Kittel and John Degenkolb . Cavendish won the points <unk> at the 2013 Giro and had shown his form with thirteen wins in the season . In the previous year 's Tour , Sagan won the points classification and had won the same at the Tour de Suisse in the month preceding the Tour . Greipel , whose team manager Marc Sergeant claimed he had the best sprint train , came into the Tour with nine wins in the season , including three at the Tour Down Under . Goss only had one victory in the season , but had a team of strong and experienced riders . Kittel , as with Greipel , would arrive with a team dedicated for the sprints and he had accumulated eleven wins in the season . His teammate Degenkolb won five stages at the 2012 Vuelta and it was thought he was most likely to be used for the hillier stages .

 On 24 November 2011 , the ASO announced Corsica would host the 2013 edition 's Grand Départ ( the Tour 's opening stages ) , the first time the Tour has visited the island . The route of the race was unveiled on 24 October 2012 at the Palais des Congrès in Paris . The Tour was the first to be completed entirely on French soil since 2003 and included ten new start or finish locations . The Grand Départ in Corsica consisted of three stages . The ASO chartered the Mega Smeralda <unk> in Porto @-@ Vecchio to house members of the organisation , media and others who work on the Tour and to host press conferences , although the riders stayed in hotels in and around the town . 
 The opening stage left Porto @-@ Vecchio and ended in Bastia , with next two stages ending in Ajaccio and Calvi respectively . The race then moved to mainland France at Nice . Stages five to eight formed a four @-@ stage journey that navigated westwards finishing at the Ax 3 <unk> ski resort in the Pyrenees . Stage nine took place between Saint @-@ <unk> to Bagnères @-@ de @-@ Bigorre , before riders took an air transfer to the north @-@ west of the country . Stage ten finished in the port city of Saint @-@ Malo , with the next finishing at the Mont Saint @-@ Michel island commune in Normandy . The following four stages , 11 to 15 , crossed the center of the country back to the south @-@ east finishing atop Mont Ventoux . The next five stages took place in and around the Alps , before a second air transfer took the Tour to the finish with the Champs @-@ Élysées stage in Paris . 
 There were 21 stages in the race , covering a total of 3 @,@ 403 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 115 mi ) , 93 @.@ 4 km ( 58 mi ) shorter than the 2012 Tour . The longest race stage was the fourth at 228 @.@ 5 km ( 142 mi ) , and stage 20 the shortest at 125 km ( 78 mi ) . It featured a final set of stages which were described by journalist William Fotheringham as " brutal " , including three Alpine stages in the last week along with a " viciously hard " time trial . As the 100th edition of the race , the 2013 edition featured some of the famous climbs from the history of the race , including a summit finishes on Mont Ventoux on stage 15 , and Alpe d 'Huez on stage 18 . These included a double ascent of the Alpe d 'Huez , the first time the tour featured a double climb of this scale . There were eight flat stages , three hilly stages , seven mountain stages ( with four summit finishes ) , two individual time trial stages and one team time trial stage . The final stage ending on the Champs @-@ Élysées was an evening finish for the first time . The rest days were after stage 9 , in Saint @-@ Nazaire , and 15 , in Vaucluse .

 In the first stage , the Orica – GreenEDGE team bus had become stuck under the finishing arch in Bastia , Corsica , and with the peloton ( the main group ) 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) away , the race officials moved the finish to the 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) to go marker . As the peloton closed in , the bus was freed , and the decision was reversed . Marcel Kittel took the victory from the bunch sprint , putting him in the race leader 's yellow jersey ; he also became the first leader of the points classification , with Juan José Lobato ( Euskaltel – Euskadi ) taking the polka dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification . Two crashes occurred in the stage ; the first with 37 km ( 23 mi ) remaining and the second in the final kilometers , which included a contender for the stage , Mark Cavendish . The second stage RadioShack – Leopard 's Jan Bakelants launched an attack from a breakaway group in the final kilometer to win in Ajaccio , one second ahead of the encroaching peloton . The yellow jersey switched to Bakelants , and Pierre Rolland of Team Europcar claimed the polka dot . Simon Gerrans ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) won the third stage , the final in Corsica , from a bunch sprint in Calvi . Peter Sagan took over the points classification . Orica – GreenEDGE won stage four 's 33 km ( 20 @.@ 5 mi ) team time trial in and around Nice , putting Gerrans in the yellow jersey . Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step came in second place , one second in arrears , with Team Sky a further two . 
 The fifth and sixth stages ended in bunch sprints , with Cavendish and André Greipel the victors respectively . After stage six , Daryl Impey became the first South African rider to wear the yellow jersey . His teammate Gerrans ensured it for him by holding back at the finish allowing Impey – who was second overall – the time necessary to replace him at the top of the general classification . Sagan claimed the seventh stage from a bunch sprint in Albi , with Ag2r – La Mondiale rider Blel Kadri talking the polka dot jersey . In stage eight , the Tour 's first mountain stage , which ended at the Ax 3 <unk> , Froome attacked a select five @-@ rider group , which included Alberto Contador and Alejandro Valverde , as they passed the lone leader Nairo Quintana with 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) remaining . Froome took the stage win , fifty @-@ one seconds ahead of his teammate Richie Porte , with Valverde third a further seventeen down . Contador and Quintana finished one minute forty @-@ five seconds behind Froome . Froome 's victory win put him in the lead of the general and mountains classifications , ahead of Porte . In the ninth stage , Froome managed to subdue attacks from his rivals , although his team 's efforts left him isolated for the majority of the stage . After a descent from the mountain pass of La <unk> d <unk> , a group of twenty @-@ three riders came into the finish in Bagnères @-@ de @-@ Bigorre , where Dan Martin ( Garmin – Sharp ) beat Jakob Fuglsang ( Astana ) from sprint , twenty seconds ahead of the group . Porte lost eighteen minutes , dropping from second overall to thirty @-@ third , with Valverde moving up to second . Rolland took back the polka dot jersey . The next day was the first rest day of the Tour . 
 Kittel took his second stage of the Tour win from the bunch sprint in the tenth stage , with his compatriot Greipel second . Stage eleven 's individual time trial between Avranches and Mont Saint @-@ Michel was taken by Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step 's Tony Martin . Froome came second with a deficit of twelve seconds , over two minutes ahead of the second placed overall Valverde , extending his lead to over three minutes . Two flat stages ending with bunch sprints then followed ; the first , stage twelve , was won by Kittel , ahead of Cavendish , who came back to win the next . The stage saw Valverde suffer a punctured tyre and lose almost ten minutes , struggling to match the pace set by Cavendish 's Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step team at the head of the race . Stage fourteen was taken by Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step 's Matteo Trentin from a large breakaway that held off the peloton . Stage fifteen , finishing on Mont Ventoux , saw all of the leading contenders , with exception of Froome and Contador , dropped on the early part of the final climb . Froome then moved away from Contador and caught Quintana , who had attacked earlier in the climb . The pair worked together to put time into their rivals , before Froome attacked with 1 @.@ 2 km ( 0 @.@ 7 mi ) remaining and soloed to the finish . This gave Froome a lead of four minutes and fourteen seconds over Mollema in second place , with Contador a further eleven seconds back . Froome regained the lead in the mountains classification . The following day was the Tour 's second rest day . 
 The sixteenth stage saw a twenty @-@ six rider breakaway reach the final climb , the Col de Manse , where Rui Costa ( Lampre – Merida ) attacked and then descended own his own to the finish in Gap . Froome won stage seventeen 's time trial , finishing the 32 km ( 19 @.@ 9 mi ) course from Embrun to <unk> in 51 minutes and 33 seconds , with Contador coming in nine seconds behind , in second place . Contador moved up to second overall , four minutes and thirty @-@ four seconds down , with teammate Roman Kreuziger third . In the Tour 's queen stage , the eighteenth , early breakaway riders Christophe Riblon ( Ag2r – La Mondiale ) and Tejay van Garderen lead on the second ascent of Alpe d 'Huez . Van Garderen attacked on the early slopes , opening up a margin of forty @-@ five seconds on Riblon in the second part of the climb , before Riblon passed with 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining and took the stage win by fifty @-@ nine seconds . Quintana and Rodríguez came in fourth and fifth respectively , over two minutes in arrears . With 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) to go , Porte and Froome , who came in under minute after the aforementioned pair , were penalised twenty seconds as Porte went back to the team car to retrieved an energy gel and water bottle for Froome outside the designated zone . Froome extended his lead over Contador by thirty @-@ seven seconds . 
 Costa repeated his feat of three stages previous by taking victory in stage nineteen , by attacking on the final climb of Col de la Croix Fry and soloing to the finish in Le Grand @-@ <unk> . There were no major changes at the head of general classification . Stage twenty , the penultimate stage , saw the leaders of the general classification still together at the head of the race with 8 km ( 5 mi ) remaining of the final climb of Mont <unk> . Quintana and Rodríguez then attacked , with Froome the only rider able to bridge , and again the pair pulling away , with Quintana managing to hold off Rodríguez by eighteen seconds to take the stage win , with Froome a further eleven down . Contador came in seventh , two minutes and twenty @-@ eight in arrears , dropping to fourth overall , with Rodríguez moving up to third . With the double points gained with his win Quintana secured the mountains classification . 
 The final stage was won by Kittel on the Champs @-@ Élysées , his fourth stage win of the race . Froome finished the race to claim his first Tour de France , becoming the second British rider to win the race . He beat second @-@ placed Quintana by four minutes and twenty seconds , with Rodríguez third , a further forty @-@ four seconds down . Sagan won his second consecutive points classification with a total of 409 , 100 ahead of Cavendish in second . Froome placed second behind Quintana in the mountains classification , with Rolland third . The best young rider was Quintana , followed by Andrew Talansky ( Garmin – Sharp ) and Michał Kwiatkowski ( Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step ) respectively . Saxo – Tinkoff finished as the winners of the team classification , eight minutes and twenty @-@ eight seconds ahead of second @-@ placed Ag2r – La Mondiale . 
 = = Classification leadership = = 
 There were four main individual classifications contested in the 2013 Tour de France , as well as a team competition . The most important was the general classification , which was calculated by adding each rider 's finishing times on each stage . The rider with the least accumulated time is the race leader , identified by the yellow jersey ; the winner of this classification will be considered the winner of the Tour . If a crash happened within the final 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) of a stage , not including time trials and summit finishes , the riders involved received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred . There were no time bonuses given for this edition of the Tour . 
 The points classification leader was identified with a green jersey . Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish , or in intermediate sprints during the stage . The points available for each stage finish were determined by the " coefficient " ranking scale . 
 No changes were made to the mountains classification , where points were awarded to the riders that reached the top of the most difficult ascents first . The climbs were categorised as either hors catégorie ( English : beyond category ) , first , second , third , or fourth @-@ category , with more points available for the higher @-@ categorized climbs . The overall leader wore a polka dot jersey . Double points were awarded on the summit finishes on stages 5 , 15 , 18 and 20 . 
 The young rider classification , denoted by a white jersey , was calculated the same way as the general classification , but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1988 . The team classification was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage ( not the team time @-@ trial ) ; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time . The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie . The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets . In addition , there was a combativity award , given after each stage to the rider considered , by a jury , to have " made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship " . The winner wore a red number bib the following stage . At the conclusion of the Tour , Christophe Riblon won the overall super @-@ combativity award . 
 A total of € 2 @,@ 023 @,@ 300 was awarded in cash prizes in the race . The overall winner of the general classification received € 450 @,@ 000 , with the second and third placed riders getting € 200 @,@ 000 and € 100 @,@ 000 respectively ; all finishers of the race were awarded with money . The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they lead ; the final winners of the points and mountains were given € 25 @,@ 000 , while the best young rider and most combative rider got € 20 @,@ 000 . Team prizes were available , with € 10 @,@ 000 for the team time trial and € 50 @,@ 000 for the winners of the team classification . There was also a special award with a prize of € 5 @,@ 000 , the Souvenir Henri Desgrange , given to first rider ( Nairo Quintana ) to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour , the Port de <unk> in stage eight .

 The race was the eighteenth of the twenty @-@ nine events in the UCI World Tour , with riders from the WorldTeams competing individually for points that contributed towards the rankings . Points were awarded to the top twenty finishers in the general classification and to the top five finishers in each stage . The 587 points accrued by Chris Froome put him in to the lead of the individual ranking , with Peter Sagan dropping to second . Team Sky retained their lead of the team ranking , ahead of Movistar Team . Spain remained as leaders of the nations ranking , with Great Britain second . 
 = The American and the Queen = 
 The American and the Queen is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company . The film focuses on Maud , the fictional queen of <unk> , who is overthrown by her cousin , Rupert . Maud is thrown into prison after refusing the romantic advances of Rupert . She escapes with the aid of her lady @-@ in @-@ waiting and a priest . A wealthy American named Jack Walton , foils an assassination attempt on Maud and he falls in love with her . Maud is recaptured and set to be executed when the priest comes up with a plan to save her , by marrying Jack and Maud . The ceremony takes place through her cell window , and soon the United States military arrives to save the now wife of an American . Rupert is killed in the ensuing conflict . No known cast or production credits for the film is known . The film was released on November 11 , 1910 and was met with neutral to negative reviews by critics . The patriotic element of the film was cited as likely being comical for European audiences and the film was also used as an example of an inappropriate example of American flag @-@ waving . The film is presumed lost . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from October 22 , 1910 . It states : " Maud , the beautiful queen of <unk> , is deposed through the efforts of her wicked cousin , Rupert , who seizes the throne . He tries to make love to Maud , but when she spurns him he has her thrown into prison . Through the efforts of her faithful lady @-@ in @-@ waiting , and the kindly priest , the young queen escapes . While on a steamer , her cousin 's spy locates her and decides to give her poison , but his attempt is detected by Jack Walton , wealthy young American who has seen the queen and fallen in love with her without knowing anything as to her history . A number of noblemen urge the queen to make an effort to regain the throne , and when Jack joins his plea to theirs , she consents . But the queen is only in her country a few hours when she is arrested during the absence of Jack on a mission . " 
 " Jack prepares to save the queen , but has hit on no definite plan . Then Father Paul proposes a scheme . The queen 's prison is on the ground floor ; it is possible for her to stretch her hand through the bars . And Jack marries the woman he loves , though a stone wall is between them . The priest , with the bridegroom is outside , and the careless guards do not see them . Rupert then sends for his cousin again , and for the second time he offers to marry her . But she spurns him . Then he orders her execution . The sentence is about to be carried out when Jack arrives with a squad of U.S. troops from a troop ship in the harbor . The queen is entitled to their protection , for she is now the wife of an American . And she gets it . Rupert loses his life and the ensuing combat . " 
 = = Production = = 
 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . A reviewer said that the film was a poor take on Anthony Hope , but did not further expand on the nature of this connection . This was likely a reference to Anthony Hope 's works like The Prisoner of Zenda and may have been made due to the arrival of a foreigner who resolves a royal conspiracy . Bowers would list this film as being of " patriotic " character instead of listing it simply as a drama or a comedy production . The patriotic element of the film was heavily promoted in advertising and was likely true given the reaction of viewers to the film . One article in The Moving Picture News referred to the film as an example of a problematic use of the United States flag appearing suddenly with the marines at the climax of the plot , all while on foreign soil . 
 The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson . Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith , Carl Louis Gregory , and Alfred H. Moses , Jr. though none are specifically credited . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . The cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list includes G.W. Abbe , Justus D. Barnes , Frank H. Crane , Irene Crane , Marie Eline , Violet Heming , Martin J. Faust , Thomas Fortune , George Middleton , Grace Moore , John W. Noble , Anna Rosemond , Mrs. George Walters . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 The single reel drama , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on November 11 , 1910 . The film was originally planned to be released on November 4 , but it was delayed and some advertisements and later listings for the film give the erroneous date . The film received negative reviews in trade publications from even those which typically praised even the weaker productions . Though it was not well @-@ received , the production was not criticized as sharply as Avenged had been . Walton of The Moving Picture News stated that the film was " [ a ] very feeble echo on Anthony Hope . The throne room staging is ridiculous and so is the resolution . The flag @-@ waving business is feebly melodramatic . Princes , etc. don 't sit on that sort of chair . I 'm an admirer of Thanhouser , but this thing is straight , plain punk . In Europe it will be received as a Yankee joke . " The reviewer for The Moving Picture World was decidedly neutral , highlighting only the novelty of the plot and refraining from any criticism or praise of the merits of the production . The New York Dramatic Mirror was negative , but not scathing . The reviewer stated , " The narrative is very entertaining - or could be made so , if the producer had cared to trouble himself about details . In its present crude form , its wild impossibility rather grates upon a spectator , because every scene in the film has some inconsistency . At least , it was worth doing well . Unfortunately , neither the acting nor the mounting has any particular merit . " 
 = ROT13 = 
 ROT13 ( " rotate by 13 places " , sometimes hyphenated <unk> @-@ 13 ) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet . ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher , developed in ancient Rome . 
 Because there are 26 letters ( 2 × 13 ) in the basic Latin alphabet , ROT13 is its own inverse ; that is , to undo ROT13 , the same algorithm is applied , so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding . The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security , and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption . 
 ROT13 is used in online forums as a means of hiding spoilers , punchlines , puzzle solutions , and offensive materials from the casual glance . ROT13 has been described as the " Usenet equivalent of a magazine printing the answer to a quiz upside down " . ROT13 has inspired a variety of letter and word games on @-@ line , and is frequently mentioned in newsgroup conversations . 
 = = Description = = 
 Applying ROT13 to a piece of text merely requires examining its alphabetic characters and replacing each one by the letter 13 places further along in the alphabet , wrapping back to the beginning if necessary . A becomes N , B becomes O , and so on up to M , which becomes Z , then the sequence continues at the beginning of the alphabet : N becomes A , O becomes B , and so on to Z , which becomes M. Only those letters which occur in the English alphabet are affected ; numbers , symbols , whitespace , and all other characters are left unchanged . Because there are 26 letters in the English alphabet and 26 = 2 × 13 , the ROT13 function is its own inverse : 
 <formula> for any basic Latin @-@ alphabet text x . 
 In other words , two successive applications of ROT13 restore the original text ( in mathematics , this is sometimes called an involution ; in cryptography , a reciprocal cipher ) . 
 The transformation can be done using a lookup table , such as the following : 
 For example , in the following joke , the punchline has been obscured by ROT13 : 
 Why did the chicken cross the road ? 
 Gb <unk> <unk> gur <unk> <unk> ! 
 Transforming the entire text via ROT13 form , the answer to the joke is revealed : 
 Jul <unk> gur <unk> <unk> gur <unk> ? 
 To get to the other side ! 
 A second application of ROT13 would restore the original . 
 = = Usage = = 
 ROT13 was in use in the <unk> newsgroup by the early 1980s . It is used to hide potentially offensive jokes , or to obscure an answer to a puzzle or other spoiler . A shift of thirteen was chosen over other values , such as three as in the original Caesar cipher , because thirteen is the value for which encoding and decoding are equivalent , thereby allowing the convenience of a single command for both . ROT13 is typically supported as a built @-@ in feature to newsreading software . Email addresses are also sometimes encoded with ROT13 to hide them from less sophisticated spam bots . 
 ROT13 is an example of the encryption algorithm known as a Caesar cipher , attributed to Julius Caesar in the 1st century BC . 
 In encrypted , normal , English @-@ language text of any significant size , ROT13 is recognizable from some letter / word patterns . The words " n " , " V " ( capitalized only ) , and " gur " ( ROT13 for " a " , " I " , and " the " ) , and words ending in " yl " ( " ly " ) are examples . 
 ROT13 is not intended to be used where secrecy is of any concern — the use of a constant shift means that the encryption effectively has no key , and decryption requires no more knowledge than the fact that ROT13 is in use . Even without this knowledge , the algorithm is easily broken through frequency analysis . Because of its utter unsuitability for real secrecy , ROT13 has become a catchphrase to refer to any conspicuously weak encryption scheme ; a critic might claim that " 56 @-@ bit DES is little better than ROT13 these days " . Also , in a play on real terms like " double DES " , the terms " double ROT13 " , " <unk> " , or " <unk> " crop up with humorous intent , including a spoof academic paper " On the <unk> Encryption Algorithm " . As applying ROT13 to an already ROT13 @-@ encrypted text restores the original plaintext , <unk> is equivalent to no encryption at all . By extension , triple @-@ ROT13 ( used in joking analogy with <unk> ) is equivalent to regular ROT13 . 
 In December 1999 , it was found that Netscape Communicator used ROT13 as part of an insecure scheme to store email passwords . In 2001 , Russian programmer Dimitry <unk> demonstrated that an eBook vendor , New Paradigm Research Group ( <unk> ) , used ROT13 to encrypt their documents ; it has been speculated that <unk> may have mistaken the ROT13 toy example — provided with the Adobe eBook software development kit — for a serious encryption scheme . Windows XP uses ROT13 on some of its registry keys . ROT13 is also used in the Unix fortune program to encrypt potentially offensive dicta . 
 = = Letter games and net culture = = 
 ROT13 provides an opportunity for letter games . Some words will , when transformed with ROT13 , produce another word . Examples of 7 @-@ letter pairs in the English language are <unk> and nowhere , and Chechen and purpura . Other examples of words like these are shown in the table . The pair gnat and tang is an interesting example which are both ROT13 reciprocals and ( taken together ) a palindrome . 
 The 1989 International <unk> C Code Contest ( <unk> ) included an entry by Brian Westley . Westley 's computer program can be encoded in ROT13 or reversed and still compiles correctly . Its operation , when executed , is either to perform ROT13 encoding on , or to reverse its input . 
 The newsgroup <unk> coined a word — <unk> — that was the ROT13 encoding of the frequently encoded utterance " <unk> " . " <unk> " evolved in mid @-@ 1992 as a response to postings repeating urban myths on <unk> , after some posters complained that " Sheesh ! " as a response to newcomers was being overused . 
 = = Variants = = 
 <unk> is a practice similar to ROT13 that applies to numeric digits ( 0 to 9 ) . ROT13 and <unk> can be used together in the same message . 
 ROT47 is a derivative of ROT13 which , in addition to scrambling the basic letters , also treats numbers and common symbols . Instead of using the sequence A – Z as the alphabet , ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common character encoding known as ASCII . Specifically , the 7 @-@ bit printable characters , excluding space , from decimal 33 ' ! ' through 126 ' ~ ' , 94 in total , taken in the order of the numerical values of their ASCII codes , are rotated by 47 positions , without special consideration of case . For example , the character A is mapped to p , while a is mapped to 2 . The use of a larger alphabet produces a more thorough obfuscation than that of ROT13 ; for example , a telephone number such as + 1 @-@ 415 @-@ 839 @-@ <unk> is not obvious at first sight from the scrambled result <unk> \ <unk> \ <unk> \ <unk> . On the other hand , because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols into the mix without discrimination , it is more immediately obvious that the text has been enciphered . 
 Example : 
 The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog . 
 <unk> to 
 % 96 " F : 4 < <unk> @ H ? u @ I <unk> > AD ~ <unk> % 96 { <unk> s @ 8 ] 
 The GNU C library , a set of standard routines available for use in computer programming , contains a function — <unk> ( ) — which has a similar purpose to ROT13 , although it is intended for use with arbitrary binary data . The function operates by combining each byte with the binary pattern <unk> ( 42 ) using the exclusive or ( XOR ) operation . This effects a simple XOR cipher . Like ROT13 , XOR ( and therefore <unk> ( ) ) is self @-@ reciprocal , and provides a similar , virtually absent , level of security .

 The ROT13 and ROT47 are fairly easy to implement using the Unix terminal application tr ; to encrypt the string " The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog " in ROT13 :

 and in the <unk> text editor , one can ROT13 a selection with the command :

 = Hurricane Rick ( 2009 ) = 
 Hurricane Rick is the third @-@ most intense Pacific hurricane on record . Developing south of Mexico on October 15 , 2009 , Hurricane Rick traversed an area favoring rapid intensification , allowing it to become a hurricane within 24 hours of being declared a tropical depression . An eye began to form during the afternoon of October 16 ; once fully formed , the storm underwent another period of rapid strengthening . During the afternoon of October 17 , the storm attained Category 5 status on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Several hours later , Rick attained its peak intensity as the third @-@ strongest Pacific hurricane on record with winds of 180 mph ( 285 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 906 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 75 inHg ) . 
 After maintaining this intensity for several hours , Rick began to weaken in response to a combination of an eyewall replacement cycle and increasing wind shear . By October 19 , the storm was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane and the following day to a tropical storm . The long @-@ anticipated northeast turn took place near the end of this phase , also accompanied by a brief decrease in forward motion . On October 21 , Rick quickly moved northeast , brushing the tip of Baja California Sur before making landfall near Mazatlán with winds of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ; 52 kn ) . Several hours after moving inland , the final advisory from the NHC was issued as the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated . 
 Prior to landfall , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) initially forecast Rick to make landfall in southern Baja California as a high @-@ end Category 2 hurricane , prompting hurricane watches . Officials ordered several hundred residents to evacuate from low @-@ lying areas , although tropical storm warnings replaced the hurricane watches after the storm had weakened . Overall , the damage from Rick was significantly less than initially anticipated . In Mexico , three people were killed by the storm , one in Oaxaca and two in Baja California Sur . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Rick originated from a strong tropical disturbance wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on October 3 , 2009 . Convective activity was initially sparse as the system tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean . By October 8 , an area of low pressure developed within the disturbance wave and convection increased . The low eventually moved over South America and dissipated on October 11 . The wave , however , remained well @-@ defined and continued westward , entering the Pacific Ocean on October 12 . By the morning of October 15 , the wave began to regain convection and eventually spawned a new area of low pressure roughly 475 mi ( 764 km ; 413 nmi ) south @-@ southwest of Puerto Ángel , Mexico . By the afternoon , the NHC reported that the system had become increasingly organized and was likely to develop into a tropical depression later that day . Around 11 : 00 am PDT ( 1800 UTC ) , the NHC declared that the low had developed into a tropical depression , the 20th of the 2009 Pacific hurricane season . The storm featured well @-@ developed outflow in all directions . Environmental conditions consisting of low wind shear , high moisture content and above average sea surface temperatures in the path of the system were exceptionally favorable for rapid development . Additionally , the storm was being steered through this region by a low- to mid @-@ level ridge over Mexico . 
 Six hours after being declared a depression , the system quickly intensified into a tropical storm , at which time it was given the name Rick . Deep convection , an early indication of an eye forming , had begun wrapping around the center of the system . Early on October 16 , a ragged eyewall began to develop and several hours later , Rick intensified into a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 75 mph ( 121 km / h ; 65 kn ) . The rapid intensification was fueled by waters of 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) , several degrees above average . By the evening of October 16 , microwave satellite imagery depicted a well @-@ defined eye ; however , this feature was not present on infrared images . Despite this , the NHC upgraded Rick to a Category 2 hurricane with winds now reaching 100 mph ( 161 km / h ; 87 kn ) . Early the next morning , the storm intensified into a major hurricane , a storm that ranks as a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . The eye was clearly visible on satellite images and deep , very cold convection surrounded it , signifying a powerful cyclone . Less than 40 minutes after this upgrade , the NHC issued a special advisory stating that Rick had further strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane . 
 Continuing to gain strength , Rick attained winds of 145 mph ( 233 km / h ; 126 kn ) several hours later on October 17 . A possible outer eyewall , a second eye larger than the first that often forms at the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle , was noted at this time . The eye of the storm became very well @-@ defined and nearly cloud free , measuring roughly 11 @.@ 5 mi ( 18 @.@ 5 km ; 10 @.@ 0 nmi ) in diameter . In addition to the rapid intensification , Rick was also growing in size . By the afternoon hours , tropical storm @-@ force winds extended up to 155 mi ( 249 km ; 135 nmi ) from the center of the storm , with a maximum gale diameter of 300 mi ( 483 km ; 261 nmi ) . At 3 : 10 pm PDT ( 2210 UTC ) , the NHC issued its second special advisory for Rick , this time stating that the storm had become a Category 5 hurricane , the first in the basin since Hurricane Kenna in 2002 . Around 8 : 00 pm PDT ( 0300 UTC on October 18 ) , Rick attained its peak intensity as the third @-@ strongest Pacific hurricane on record . Maximum sustained winds in the eyewall reached 180 mph ( 290 km / h ; 156 kn ) and the barometric pressure is estimated to have bottomed out at 906 mbar ( 906 @.@ 00 hPa ; 26 @.@ 75 inHg ) . The pressure was not directly measured as reconnaissance missions by Hurricane Hunter aircraft were not done because the storm was too far from land . Lixion Avila , a senior hurricane specialist at the NHC , described Rick 's satellite presentation at this time as " spectacular . " 
 Rick maintained its peak intensity for roughly two hours between 7 : 00 pm and 9 : 00 pm PDT ( 0200 and 0400 UTC ) on October 17 , before it began to weaken in response to an eyewall replacement cycle and increasing wind shear . By the afternoon of October 18 , the storm had weakened to a low @-@ end Category 5 hurricane , with maximum winds of 160 mph ( 257 km / h ; 139 kn ) . Deep convection around the eye warmed slightly and a combination of dry air and wind shear restrained the extent of the storms ' outflow to the west . Later that day , Rick began to turn towards the northwest as the subtropical ridge north of the system began to weaken . Early on October 19 , Rick was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane as it began its approach to the southern end of the Baja California peninsula . Wind shear and dry air quickly entered the core of the system , with the eye disappearing from satellite imagery later that morning . 
 During the evening of October 19 , the center of Rick became devoid of convective activity , resulting in the NHC downgrading it to a tropical storm . According to meteorologists at the NHC , the weakening was " ... almost as fast as it strengthened several days ago . " The first Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission into the storm took place during the afternoon of October 20 . During the mission , sustained winds of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ; 56 kn ) and a surface pressure of 990 mbar ( 990 @.@ 00 hPa ; 29 @.@ 23 inHg ) were recorded . Several hours after this , convection rapidly increased , with a large area of deep convection developing northeast of the center of circulation ; however , this was not associated with intensification . Around 7 : 00 am PDT ( 1400 UTC ) on October 21 . Tropical Storm Rick made landfall near Mazatlán with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . Following landfall , the storm rapidly weakened to a tropical depression and roughly seven hours after moving inland , the surface circulation of Rick dissipated over the high terrain of Mexico .

 Officials in Oaxaca shut down beaches and warned people not to venture out into the water . Residents were advised of potentially heavy rainfall . Along coastal areas of Mexico , specifically around Acapulco , officials closed ports to small crafts due to rough seas . Residents around the city were also warned about the possibility of mudslides from heavy rain associated with the cyclone 's outer bands . Upon Rick 's intensification to a Category 4 hurricane , officials in Mexico raised the alert level in Guerrero , Jalisco and Michoacán to severe . In Sonora , the local government placed 14 municipalities under a blue alert , the pre @-@ storm phase ; the alert was upgraded to a yellow alert for the municipalities of Álamos , Benito Juárez , Navojoa , Etchojoa and Huatabampo on October 18 . 
 Early on October 19 , the Government of Mexico issued a hurricane watch for areas of Baja California Sur between Santa Fe and San Evaristo . Following the issuance of the watch , authorities in the region began planning to open shelters and begin evacuating residents from low @-@ lying areas . Later that day , the watch was replaced by a tropical storm warning as Rick weakened to a tropical storm . By October 20 , a new tropical storm watch was issued for mainland Mexico for areas between El Roblito and Altata . Shortly after , officials had opened nine shelters in the region ; however , schools remained open until further notice . Later in the day , the tropical storm warning for Baja California was discontinued while the watch for mainland Mexico was upgraded to a warning . This warning was later discontinued on October 21 as Rick dissipated over the mountains of Mexico . Several cruises were affected by the storm throughout southern Baja California . The Carnival Splendor made a sudden docking as the storm formed and delayed its arrival in Cabo San Lucas by several days . The Carnival Spirit , scheduled to dock in Acapulco on October 21 , delayed its arrival until October 22 . The Sapphire Princess rescheduled its course , remaining near San Francisco , California , for several additional days instead of traveling south . The Norwegian Star skipped its planned docking in Cabo San Lucas and remained at sea until the passage of Rick . Other cruises affected by the storm include Radiance of the Seas , Mariner of the Seas , MS Veendam and MS <unk> .

 Schools throughout southern Sinaloa were closed for two days beginning on October 21 due to the arrival of Tropical Storm Rick . Residents in low @-@ lying areas were urged to evacuate due to both storm surge and fresh water flooding from the anticipated 3 to 6 in ( 76 to 152 mm ) of rain . Although several hundred miles from land , wind gusts up to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) were felt along coastal areas in Mazatlán . Near the coast of Oaxaca , large seas capsized a boat carrying three people . Two of the passengers were rescued ; however , the third was found dead . Large swells killed one person along the southern end of Baja California Sur on October 19 . Another fatality took place in the same region after a boy was swept away from an eroded beach . Roughly 320 people near Cabo San Lucas were evacuated due to the threat of flooding . Reports near the city also indicated that there was structural damage and significant traffic issues from rain @-@ induced mudslides . 
 In Mazatlán , near where Rick made landfall , high winds downed trees and signs , leaving numerous residents without power . Heavy rain was also reported during the passage of the storm . Throughout Mexico , damage from Rick amounted to 192 million pesos ( $ 14 @.@ 6 million USD ) . On December 29 , the Government of Mexico allocated 381 million pesos ( $ 29 @.@ 6 million USD ) to assist in recovery from both Hurricanes Jimena and Rick .

 Although no longer a tropical cyclone , remnant moisture from Rick enhanced a strong cold front over the Great Plains of the United States . Severe thunderstorms occurred over parts of the southern states , with at least three tornadoes touching down in Louisiana . Further north , the complex brought heavy rainfall to the northeast and parts of southern Canada . In Louisiana , the storm system spawned seven tornadoes , two of which were ranked as EF @-@ 1 . One of these tornadoes damaged more than 10 structures , destroyed a grain silo , flipped a tractor trailer and left numerous residents without power . In all , the tornadoes left nearly $ 1 million in losses and injured one person . 
 In Texas , the remnants of Rick produced torrential rainfall , peaking at 9 @.@ 34 in ( 237 mm ) within a concentrated area . Meteorologists did not anticipate the severity of the precipitation in this area . One person was killed after being swept away in her Jeep on a flooded roadway . Several homes were also flooded during the event and an estimated 300 homes were left without power . Following the floods , numerous roads were closed and some schools had delayed openings . Throughout the state , flood damage amounted to $ 690 @,@ 000 , with most of this being in Travis County . Heavy rainfall in Louisiana contributed to widespread flooding that resulted in the closure of several major highways . In Union Parish , rainfall exceeding 6 in ( 150 mm ) led to flash flooding that inundated several homes and a local school , inflicting over $ 100 @,@ 000 in damage . 
 = = Records and intensity forecasts = = 
 On October 17 , Hurricane Rick was classified a Category 5 hurricane , becoming the first in the eastern Pacific basin since Hurricane Kenna in 2002 and the first east of the International Date Line since Hurricane Ioke in 2006 . The storm also became the thirteenth cyclone of this intensity east of the International Date Line since official records in the Eastern Pacific began in 1949 . Shortly after being upgraded to Category 5 , Rick attained its peak intensity with winds of 180 mph ( 290 km / h ; 156 kn ) and a barometric pressure of 906 mbar ( 906 @.@ 00 hPa ; 26 @.@ 75 inHg ) , making it the second @-@ strongest hurricane ever recorded in the East Pacific , surpassing Kenna . Only Hurricane Linda of 1997 was stronger than Rick , with minimum pressure of 902 mbar ( 902 hPa ; 26 @.@ 6 inHg ) . Hurricane Patricia in 2015 later far surpassed both Rick and Linda , attaining a pressure of 872 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 75 inHg ) . It also became the second storm in the basin to have sustained winds of 180 mph ( 290 km / h ; 156 kn ) or higher , the first being Linda with 185 mph ( 298 km / h ; 161 kn ) winds . Patricia surpassed both with 215 mph ( 346 km / h ; 187 kn ) winds . 
 Upon being declared a tropical depression on October 15 , computer forecasting models already anticipated the likelihood of rapid intensification due to the unusually favorable environmental conditions ahead of the system . The Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model ( HWRF ) showed the storm attaining a minimum pressure below 900 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 58 inHg ) , an intensity not attained by any Eastern Pacific hurricane on record at the time . The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme ( SHIPS ) rapid intensification index , a storm 's probability of intensifying by 35 mph ( 56 km / h ; 30 kn ) or more within 24 hours , was set at 60 % . This percentage quickly increased to 82 % several hours later , 11 times higher than the sample mean . The official forecast from the NHC by their second advisory stated that Rick would become a Category 4 hurricane by October 19 ; however , they mentioned that due to the favorable environment , the storm could intensify faster than forecast . Once Rick had become a Category 2 storm on October 16 , the NHC increased their forecast peak intensity to 145 mph ( 233 km / h ; 126 kn ) , a mid @-@ range Category 4 hurricane . 
 The first mention of Rick possibly becoming a Category 5 hurricane was in the seventh discussion released by the NHC on October 17 . In their advisory , it was noted that the storm had a 10 % chance of reaching this intensity within 36 hours . Several hours after this advisory was released , a special update advisory was issued . This new advisory placed the peak intensity of Rick just below Category 5 status , with maximum winds of 155 mph ( 249 km / h ; 135 kn ) . It was not until the late morning hours of October 17 that the NHC officially anticipated the storm to attain Category 5 status . Upon attaining winds of 180 mph ( 290 km / h ; 156 kn ) , Rick was forecast to peak with winds of 185 mph ( 298 km / h ; 161 kn ) , which would have tied the record intensity set by Hurricane Linda . 
 = Tithonus poem = 
 The Tithonus poem , also known as the old age poem or ( with fragments of another poem by Sappho discovered at the same time ) the New Sappho , is a poem by the archaic Greek poet Sappho . It is part of fragment 58 in Eva @-@ Maria Voigt 's edition of Sappho . The poem is from Book IV of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho 's poetry . It has been partially known since 1922 , but in 2004 more papyrus fragments were published , drawing international media attention , which almost completed the poem . The poem is one of very few substantially complete poems by Sappho , and deals with the effects of ageing . There is scholarly debate about where the poem ends , as four lines previously thought to have been part of the poem are not found on the 2004 papyrus . 
 = = Preservation = = 
 = = = Oxyrhynchus papyrus = = = 
 Part of the Tithonus poem was originally published in 1922 on a fragment of papyrus from Oxyrhynchus . This fragment preserved part of 27 lines of Sappho 's poetry , including the Tithonus poem . The papyrus appears to be part of a copy of Book IV of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho 's poetry , as all of the poems appear to be in the same metre . From the handwriting , the papyrus can be dated to the second century AD . Today the papyrus is part of the collection of the Sackler Library in Oxford University . 
 = = = Cologne papyrus = = = 
 In 2004 , Martin Gronewald and Robert Daniel published three fragments of papyrus from the Cologne Papyrus Collection , which taken with the existing fragment from Oxyrhynchus provided the almost complete text to five stanzas of the poem . The Cologne papyrus , preserved on <unk> , is from the early third century BC , making it the oldest known papyrus containing a poem by Sappho . 
 The papyrus is part of an anthology of poetry , with poems on similar themes grouped together . Along with the Tithonus poem , two others are preserved on the papyrus published by Gronewald and Daniel : one in the same metre , one written in a different hand and in a different metre . The metre of this last poem has characteristics which do not appear in any known metre used by the Lesbian poets . It also contains word forms which appear not to be in the <unk> dialect used by Sappho , and refers to the myth of Orpheus in a form not known to have existed in Sappho 's time . For these reasons , the poem cannot be by Sappho . 
 = = Poem = = 
 The Tithonus poem is twelve lines long , and is in a metre called " acephalous <unk> with internal double @-@ <unk> expansion " . It is the fourth poem by Sappho to be sufficiently complete to treat as an entire work , along with the Ode to Aphrodite , fragment 16 , and fragment 31 : a fifth , the Brothers Poem , was discovered in 2014 . 
 The poem is written as an exhortation to a group of young women , putting forward the singer as an example to emulate . It discusses the singer 's old age , and tells the audience that while they too will grow old and lose their beauty , their musical abilities will be retained . It is one of a number of Sappho 's poems which discuss old age . 
 The poem 's common name comes from the Greek myth of Tithonus , which is mentioned in lines 9 to 12 of the poem . The story of Tithonus was popular in archaic Greek poetry , though the reference to him in this poem seems out of place , according to <unk> . Martin Litchfield West considers that these lines seem like a weak ending to the poem , though Tithonus functions as a parallel to Sappho in her old age . 
 = = = Metre = = = 
 The metre of the Tithonus poem was already known , before the discovery of the Cologne papyrus , from four quotations of Sappho . Two of these are preserved in the Enchiridion of Hephaestion ; he describes the metre as <unk> and says that Sappho used it frequently . The metre is of the form " × ¯ ˘ ˘ ¯ ¯ ˘ ˘ ¯ ¯ ˘ ˘ ¯ ˘ ¯ ¯ " , which is part of the larger class of <unk> metres . The poems in this metre by Sappho are conventionally thought to have been from the fourth book of the Alexandrian edition , though no direct evidence either confirms or denies this . 
 = = = Continuation after line 12 = = = 
 Before the Cologne papyri were published in 2004 , lines 11 to 26 of Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1787 were considered to be a single poem , fragment 58 in the Lobel @-@ Page ( and subsequently Voigt ) numbering systems . The poem on the Cologne papyrus , however , only contains 12 lines . These begin with line 11 of <unk> 1787 , confirming the long @-@ standing suggestion that the poem began there . The Cologne version of the poem is thus missing what were long believed to be the final four lines of the poem . 
 Scholars disagree about how this should be interpreted . André Lardinois lists possible explanations which have been put forward : firstly that the Cologne papyrus did not contain the full poem , but only the first twelve lines ; secondly that the poem does end after line twelve and the final lines on the Oxyrhynchus papyrus were part of another poem ; and thirdly that there were two different endings for the poem , one at line twelve and one continuing on to line sixteen . 
 West argues that the four lines missing from the Cologne papyrus were part of a separate poem , though Lardinois comments that there is no evidence in the Oxyrhynchus papyrus to confirm or deny this . However , other scholars , including Gronewald and Daniel , who originally published the Cologne fragments , believe that the poem did continue for these four lines . Lardinois suggests that there may have been two versions of the poem current in antiquity , one ending after the twelfth line , the other continuing to line 16 . Gregory Nagy agrees , arguing that the two versions were appropriate for different performance contexts . 
 If the four contested lines were part of the Tithonus poem , the poem 's tone would have changed significantly . The sixteen @-@ line version of the poem has a much more optimistic ending than the twelve @-@ line version , expressing hope for an afterlife . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The publication of the Cologne papyri in 2004 , making the Tithonus poem almost complete , drew international attention from both scholars and the popular press . The discovery was covered in newspapers in the US and the UK , as well as online . The Daily Telegraph described the discovery as " the rarest of gifts " , while Marylin Skinner said that the discovery was the find of a lifetime for classicists . 
 Since the discovery , there has been a significant amount of scholarship on the poem . At the 138th annual meeting of the American Philological Association , two separate panels discussed the poems , and papers based on these panels were later published as The New Sappho on Old Age , edited by Marylin Skinner and Ellen Greene . At least two other collections of essays on the Cologne papyri have been published . 
 = Battle of the Îles Saint @-@ Marcouf = 
 The Battle of the Îles Saint @-@ Marcouf was an engagement fought off the Îles Saint @-@ Marcouf near the Cotentin peninsula on the Normandy coast of France in May 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars . In 1795 a British garrison was placed on the islands , which operated as a resupply base for Royal Navy ships cruising off the coast of Northern France . Seeking to eliminate the British presence on the islands and simultaneously test the equipment and tactics then being developed in France for a projected invasion of Britain , the French launched a massed amphibious assault on the southern island using over 50 landing ships and thousands of troops on 7 May 1798 . Although significant Royal Navy forces were in the area , a combination of wind and tide prevented them from intervening and the island 's 500 @-@ strong garrison was left to resist the attack alone . 
 Despite the overwhelming French majority in numbers , the attack was a disaster : nearly 1 @,@ 000 French soldiers were killed as the boats were caught in open water under the island 's gun batteries : several were sunk with all hands . Heavy fire from batteries and Royal Marines prevented a single French soldier from landing and the retreating fleet was subject to heavy fire from the smaller island to the north , inflicting further losses . British casualties were negligible . Although this operation indicated the probable result of a full @-@ scale invasion of Britain , the threat remained and British forces began a close blockade of the surviving landing craft that were anchored in the Cotentin ports . A month after the battle this strategy resulted in a secondary success when a French frigate and corvette passing along the coast were intercepted and defeated by the blockade squadron . 
 = = Background = = 
 Throughout the French Revolutionary Wars , British warships patrolled the French coast , intercepting and destroying French maritime traffic and blockading French ports . In 1795 Captain Sir Sidney Smith , a prominent Royal Navy officer , recognised that if resupply points could be established on islands off the French coast then cruising warships could extend their time at sea . To this purpose , Smith seized the uninhabited Îles Saint @-@ Marcouf , which lie 3 @.@ 5 nautical miles ( 6 @.@ 5 km ) off <unk> on the Cotentin peninsula in Normandy . Smith constructed barracks and gun batteries and manned the islands with 500 sailors and Royal Marines , including a large proportion of men unfit for ship @-@ board service , described as " invalids " . The Glengarry Fencibles offered to provide a garrison , but after the French captured Smith this fell through . 
 The Royal Navy regularly supplied the <unk> food from Britain , and visiting vessels brought bags of earth that allowed the development of a vegetable garden . Smith supported the islands with several <unk> , including the converted hoys Badger , Hawke , and Shark , the fireship Nancy , and the <unk> @-@ class floating battery Sandfly , which he had had purpose @-@ built for the defence of the islands . Lieutenant Charles Papps Price , captain of Badger and an unpopular officer who had repeatedly been passed over for promotion , commanded the British occupation ; Price spent most of his time on the islands with a prostitute he had brought from Portsmouth . 
 Since the 1796 French victory in Italy over the Austrians , pressure had been growing in France for direct action against Britain . Command of an army deployed in Northern France and named the Armée d 'Angleterre was initially given to General Napoleon Bonaparte , but later passed to General Kilmaine . Bonaparte , and then Kilmaine , prepared for an invasion of Britain and Captain Muskein , a naval administrator from Antwerp , was instructed to develop a suitable fleet of landing craft to convoy the troops across the English Channel . The French Directory commissioned a Swedish naval architect Fredrik Henrik af Chapman to design the invasion barges and by 1797 ships of his design were under construction along the Northern French coast under Muskein 's supervision : the boats were known to the French soldiers as " bateaux à la Muskein " ( Muskein @-@ type boats ) . 
 In April 1798 , Muskein was ordered to prepare a squadron of his barges for an attack on the Saint Marcouf Islands . The operation was intended simultaneously to eradicate the British garrison and restore French control of the raiding base , test the effectiveness of the barges in a military amphibious operation , and focus British naval attention on the English Channel and away from Bonaparte 's preparations at Toulon for the invasion of Egypt . On 7 April 1978 , Muskein sailed from Le Havre with 33 barges under the command of General Point , but on 8 April he found his passage blocked by the British frigates HMS Diamond under Captain Sir Richard Strachan and HMS Hydra under Captain Sir Francis Laforey . At 16 : 00 the frigates cornered the barges in the mouth of the River Orne and opened fire , but Diamond grounded soon afterwards and although the frigate was brought off after darkness , neither side was able to inflict serious damage . 
 On 9 April the French flotilla was able to leave the Orne River and anchor in the harbour of Bernières @-@ sur @-@ Mer , but the arrival of the fourth rate HMS Adamant under Captain William Hotham persuaded Muskein to return to the more sheltered anchorage at the mouth of the Orne . As he returned eastward , he again came under fire from Diamond and Hydra . The French flotilla then sheltered under the batteries at Sallenelles until the damage was repaired . Over the next two weeks , however , the situation changed – Rear @-@ Admiral Jean Lacrosse at Cherbourg had been informed of Muskein 's difficulties and sent reinforcements of 40 barges and armed fishing ships to Sallenelles . Late in April , Muskein had an opportunity to escape without interception by the British force offshore and sailed as far as Saint @-@ Vaast @-@ la @-@ Hougue , to the west of the islands . There he waited for the right combination of wind and tide to allow the attack to go ahead uninterrupted by the British squadron that had followed his flotilla westwards . 
 = = Battle = = 
 On 6 May the conditions for Muskein 's attack were perfect : the calm winds prevented the British warships intercepting his flotilla , and the weak tides prevented disruption to his craft by heavy waves . The British also were aware of the conditions necessary for the attack , and made swift preparations to arm the batteries and line the shore with Royal Marines . A small boat from the islands watched as Muskein 's force rowed out of Saint @-@ Vaast @-@ la @-@ Hougue and steadily approached the islands during the evening . The sixth rate HMS Eurydice under Captain John Talbot and the brig HMS Orestes under Commander William <unk> , had joined Adamant , which was stranded 6 nautical miles ( 11 km ) away from the islands by the calm . Despite strenuous efforts , the three vessels would not be able to reach the islands in time to take part in the action . 
 At midnight , the island 's boat signaled the approach of the French and Lieutenant Price readied the defences . Muskein 's force mustered 52 vessels , including a number of brigs that mounted several large cannon and were intended to provide covering fire for the landing barges . The main body of the attacking troops numbered between 5 @,@ 000 and 6 @,@ 000 French soldiers drawn largely from coastal defence units based around Boulogne . Unwilling to risk a night attack , Muskein waited until dawn , using the remaining cover of night to draw his craft in formation facing the western defences of the southern island . The <unk> lay 300 yards ( 270 m ) offshore , behind the landing barges whose approach they would cover during the attack . As dawn broke , Muskein ordered the advance and the <unk> and smaller cannon in the barges opened fire on the British defences . 
 The West Island 's batteries , under Lieutenant Price , consisted of 17 cannon : four 4 , two 6 , and six 24 @-@ pounder long guns , and three 24 , and two 32 @-@ pounder carronades . Although eight of the guns were relatively light , the batteries inflicted devastating damage on the light invasion craft . Despite severe casualties the French barges continued their approach until they were within musket range , 50 yards ( 46 m ) . The garrison of Royal Marines opened fire and the artillery crews switched to canister shot . Six or seven boats sank with their entire crews and troops , and others were heavily damaged . Losses were so high that the French called off the attack ; even so , the return journey carried the barges past East Island , which was under the command of Lieutenant Richard Bourne of Sandfly and mounted a battery of two 68 pounder carronades , massive guns that inflicted additional severe losses . Although Hotham 's squadron made desperate efforts to reach the battle , the wind was too light and they were only able to chase the remaining ships back into Saint @-@ Vaast @-@ la @-@ Hougue . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The battle was a disaster for the French . According to unofficial accounts , they lost approximately 900 men killed or drowned and at least 300 wounded , in addition to the loss of a number of the newly constructed landing craft . In France the newly appointed Minister of Marine Étienne Eustache Bruix ordered a second attempt on the islands soon afterwards but the orders were immediately countermanded by the French Directory , which did not want the embarrassment of a second disastrous attack . Instead , Lacrosse gave orders for most of the surviving ships to be sent to Cherbourg , detachments later reaching Saint Malo and Granville . Muskein was ordered to return to Le Havre with the remainder . 
 In Britain the successful defence of the islands was highly praised and Price was promoted as a reward , although Bourne was not , despite a recommendation in the official report . British losses included a single marine killed and four other personnel wounded . The victory was seen in Britain as a foreshadowing of the likely fate of an attempted invasion and helped ease British fears about the threat of a French amphibious attack . Nearly five decades later the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp " Isles St. Marcou " upon application to all British participants then still living . 
 The British strengthened the islands ' defences , in case of further attacks , and a number of warships patrolled the area to observe French movements and intercept any flotillas of invasion craft . At the Action of 30 May 1798 , this strategy achieved an unexpected success when HMS Hydra intercepted the French frigate Confiante and a corvette off the mouth of the River Dives . The British drove Confiante ashore and boarding parties later burnt her . The islands remained under British occupation without any further French attacks until 1802 . The Peace of Amiens returned the islands to French control ; throughout the Napoleonic Wars of 1803 – 1815 they remained French , protected by a significant garrison .

 State Route 174 ( SR 174 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California . The two @-@ lane 13 @-@ mile ( 21 km ) highway , added to the state highway system in 1933 , connects Interstate 80 in Colfax with SR 20 / SR 49 in Grass Valley , crossing the Bear River next to a 1924 concrete arch bridge . The majority of the highway is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System , but local residents have blocked its designation due to property rights concerns . 
 = = Route description = = 
 State Route 174 begins at exit 135 of I @-@ 80 in Colfax . Immediately after crossing I @-@ 80 , the route turns right on Auburn Street and right again on Central Street , which bypasses downtown ; a business route follows Auburn Street , Grass Valley Street , and Main Street through downtown . SR 174 follows the old Lincoln Highway ( US 40 ) north out of downtown to Rollins Lake Road , where the present state highway turns northwest along the Colfax Highway . It then crosses the Bear River from Placer County into Nevada County on a 1987 bridge , with the old 1924 bridge preserved for non @-@ motorized traffic . The land flattens out as SR 174 curves north and west through the Empire Mine State Historic Park into Grass Valley . Turning west on Colfax Avenue , the state highway passes under the SR 20 / SR 49 freeway before ending just beyond at Auburn Street , the former surface routing of SR 49 . 
 = = History = = 
 The Capital Construction Company began improving the county road between Colfax ( on Route 37 , signed as US 40 ) and Grass Valley ( on Route 17 ) under contract on September 29 , 1931 , and completed the work by mid @-@ September 1932 . The state legislature placed it on the state highway system in 1933 as an extension of the existing Nevada City @-@ <unk> Route 25 . In the 1964 renumbering , the highway received a signed designation , State Route 174 . 
 Local residents created the Colfax Highway Association in 1967 at the <unk> firehouse , about halfway between the two ends , in order to preserve the rural nature of the road . When the 21 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 5 m ) wide 1924 concrete arch bridge that took SR 174 across the Bear River on the county line was set for replacement in the late 1980s , the group successfully lobbied to preserve it for non @-@ motorized traffic . The association also pushed for Nevada County 's Gold Country Stage bus service to add a route along the highway to Colfax , which was agreed to in late 1998 and still runs as Route 12 , connecting downtown Grass Valley with Colfax 's Amtrak station . After a request by Nevada County in 1988 , the state legislature designated the part of SR 174 in unincorporated Nevada County ( between the county line and the Grass Valley city limits ) as eligible for the State Scenic Highway System in 1991 . In 1999 , the Colfax Highway Association attempted to get the route officially declared a State Scenic Highway . They argued that the designation would " protect the scenic character and rural flavor of the highway " . A newly formed group , Concerned Citizens for 174 , opposed the designation because it would restrict the property rights of residents along the highway , for instance requiring them to use " natural colors " . The opposition was successful , and SR 174 remains eligible for State Scenic Highway status but is not a State Scenic Highway .

 = Sejm of the Estates = 
 The Sejm of the Estates ( Polish : sejm <unk> ) or Estates of Galicia ( Polish : <unk> <unk> ) were the parliament in the first half of the 19th century Galicia region in Austrian Empire . The body existed from 1775 to 1845 . In the history of the Polish parliament , it succeeded the general sejm and local sejmik on the territories of the Austrian partition . The Estates were disbanded following the Kraków Uprising of 1846 . In 1861 they were succeeded by the Sejm of the Land ( Polish : sejm krajowy ) . 
 The estates in question were primarily clergy and nobility , with a token townsfolk representation . Peasantry was not represented . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Postulate Sejm = = = 
 Parts of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth Lesser Poland territories were included in the Austrian partition as early as the First Partition of Poland in 1772 . In order to reduce dissent , the Austrian Empire in 1775 allowed the Polish nobility ( szlachta ) of the newly acquired territories to continue their tradition of holding local parliament @-@ like meetings , and gave the permission for an advisory body , the Postulate Sejm ( Polish : sejm <unk> ) , to be held every year . The implementation of the Postulate Sejm was delayed , and eventually it held only four sessions , all in Lviv ( Lwów ) : in 1782 , 1784 , 1786 and 1788 . The body had no real power ; it could only write petitions to the monarch , who had no obligation to act on them . Polish legal scholar Stanisław <unk> noted that while the Sejm , on the surface , continued the Polish parliamentary tradition , the real goal of the powerless body , as intended by the Austrian court , was to drive a wedge between the various groups of Polish nobility , reducing their unity and influence . The Postulate Sejm was composed of wealthy nobility and two deputies from the city of Lviv . The sessions lasted a few days each . The 1788 session was the last one ; parts of the Austrian @-@ held Commonwealth territories were briefly included in the Duchy of Warsaw following the Polish – Austrian War in 1806 , and the populace represented at the Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw , but this was short lived , as the territories in question were restored to Austria following the Duchy 's occupation and the terms of the Congress of Vienna in 1815 . 
 = = = Estates of Galicia = = = 
 Soon afterward , in 1817 , Francis I of Austria called for a new sejm , now named the Estates of Galicia ( Polish : <unk> <unk> ) , which met again in Lviv . Most scholars , like Jacek Jędruch , see this body as a continuation of the Postulate Sejm , and discuss both of them together . The Austrian Emperor decreed that the members have to wear a special uniform ; this made it the only Polish parliament @-@ like body in the history of Polish politics with a dress code requirement . 
 Excepting the establishment of the <unk> as a center for Polish cultural study , the Sejm reflected the conservative attitudes of the body 's unelected members from the nobility and the landed gentry . From the late 1830s an influx of new members , such as Leon Sapieha , Władysław Badeni and Agenor <unk> made the body more progressive and representative . In the 1840s the Sejm saw much debate on the subject of the abolition of serfdom . The Estates last met in 1845 , when they voted , 116 to 10 , on the proposal to abolish serfdom ; however they lacked the power to implement it and had to wait for the Emperor 's decision . The Estates were disbanded following the Kraków Uprising of 1846 , a mostly peasant rebellion aimed , ironically , at many of the nobles who were supportive of the abolition of serfdom . In 1848 , during the Spring of Nations unrest , when the Emperor tried to convene the Estates , the members refused , demanding a more representative composition , and increased powers ; the Emperor turned down their demand . In 1861 thee Estates were succeeded by the Country Sejm ( Polish : sejm krajowy ) . 
 = = Composition and organization = = 
 The number of the members was not fixed ; it varied from over 200 ( with 289 in 1782 and 213 in 1817 ) to as low as 41 ( in 1834 ) ; in most years the Sejm had averaged 60 to 80 deputies . They were composed of clergy , nobility ( either titled or above a certain , relatively high , income level ) , two deputies from the city of Lviv representing the burghers and later , chancellor of the University of Lwów . The members were not elective , holding the mandates due to their offices , titles or wealth . This made the Sejm not representative , and rather conservative . 
 The Estates met for a few days each year , with some exceptions : they were not convened in the years 1831 and 1832 ( time of the November Uprising in the neighboring Polish <unk> , the Congress Kingdom ) . 
 The Estates had no dedicated location to meet . To evade Emperor 's limitation on the proceedings duration and topics to be discussed , the members met before each session at various locations . While in session , they met at the former monastery buildings , owned by the University of Lwów . 
 = = Competences = = 
 Just like the preceding Postulate Sejm , the Estates had very limited competences : they met to hear the Emperor decrees , distribute tax assessments , grant Galician titles of nobility to individuals who already held similar titles elsewhere in the Austrian Empire , prepare petitions and appeals to be heard by the Emperor . Polish 19th @-@ century historian , Henryk Schmitt , wrote that the role of the Estates was to listen to the government decisions , and file petitions , which often waited for the royal reply for several years ; he thus notes that the Estates were powerless , a " comedy " , their only purpose being to fulfill the Congress of Vienna requirement of having some form of " national representation " on the lands of the Austrian partition . 
 = Santa María de Óvila = 
 Santa María de Óvila is a former Cistercian monastery built in Spain beginning in 1181 on the Tagus River near Trillo , Guadalajara , about 90 miles ( 140 km ) northeast of Madrid . During prosperous times over the next four centuries , construction projects expanded and improved the small monastery . Its fortunes declined significantly in the 18th century , and in 1835 it was confiscated by the Spanish government and sold to private owners who used its buildings to shelter farm animals . 
 American publisher William Randolph Hearst bought parts of the monastery in 1931 with the intention of using its stones in the construction of a grand and fanciful castle at Wyntoon , California , but after some 10 @,@ 000 stones were removed and shipped , they were abandoned in San Francisco for decades . These stones are now in various locations around California : the old church portal has been reassembled at the University of San Francisco , and the chapter house is being reassembled by Trappist monks at the Abbey of New Clairvaux in Vina , California . Other stones are serving as simple decorative elements in Golden Gate Park 's botanical garden . To support the chapter house project , a line of Belgian @-@ style beers is being produced by Sierra Nevada Brewing Company under the Ovila Abbey brand . 
 In Spain , the new government of the Second Republic declared the monastery a National Monument in June 1931 , but not in time to prevent the mass removal of stones . Today , the remnant buildings and walls stand on private farmland .

 = = = Foundation = = = 
 The monastery of Santa María de Óvila was founded in 1175 by a grant of land from King Alfonso VIII of Castile to the Cistercian monks of Valbuena Abbey in Valbuena de Duero , Valladolid Province , Castile @-@ Leon , Spain . In this endeavor , the king was following a general strategy of establishing Catholic institutions on land he had recently won in battle from the Moors of Iberia . The Cistercian " white monks " ( wearing undyed habits ) first chose a site in <unk> ( now called <unk> de Tajo ) on the Tagus , but after a few years , had to relocate to more fertile zone a few miles nearer to Trillo , Guadalajara , where a flat hilltop by the river commanded a modest view . 
 The construction began in 1181 . The monastic quarters and the church were built over the following three decades . The central cloister was bordered on the north by the church , on the west by a barrel @-@ vaulted great nave , on the east by the sacristy , the priory cell , and the chapter house , and on the south by the kitchen , the pantry and the refectory ( dining hall ) . Some of the buildings were given seven @-@ foot @-@ thick ( 2 m ) walls with slit windows , to serve as a refuge in case the Moors returned to the area . The church was built in the shape of a Latin cross with a nave divided into four sections , and a sanctuary with three square apses . Its presbytery had a central square topped by a pentagon . 
 In 1191 , the king confirmed the monastery and its surrounding fields as belonging to the Cistercian Order . The aged abbot of Santa María de Huerta , bishop Martín de <unk> ( later canonized ) , consecrated the church in September 1213 and died days later . The surrounding area of <unk> and Trillo along the Tagus prospered , giving tithes and gifts of land to the monastery . The cartulary , <unk> de Óvila is preserved at the University of Madrid . 
 The first buildings were completed in the Gothic style , including the church . The refectory ( dining hall ) shows an architectural style in transition between earlier Romanesque and contemporary Gothic . A fine High Gothic chapter house was built of best quality hard limestone . The church was rebuilt sometime before 1650 in a late Gothic style with a prominent vaulted ceiling . The cloister was rebuilt around 1617 , and is of a simple design with little adornment surrounding a High Renaissance arcade . The final phase of building took place around 1650 , with a new doorway for the church , completed in late Renaissance and <unk> style full of detail . Because of its prosperity and the repeated expansion projects , Santa María de Óvila exhibited examples of every Spanish religious architectural style used from 1200 to 1600 . However , even at its height , Óvila remained one of the smallest Cistercian monasteries in the region of Castile . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 From the 15th century , changes to the areas surrounding Santa María de Óvila initiated a slow decline . Civil wars depopulated the villages of the upper Tagus valley . The monastery 's land holdings passed one by one into the hands of the new regional aristocracy : first the Count of <unk> , followed by Rui Gomes da Silva , Duke of Pastrana , and the Spanish Army . Neighbors looted more lands . 
 A fire destroyed part of the monastery during the War of the Spanish Succession . During the Peninsular War , French troops looted the buildings and used them as barracks . The monks were forced to leave in 1820 because of confiscations by a new liberal government , but they returned in 1823 after King Ferdinand VII restored conservative institutions . However , the nearby villagers denied support to the monastery despite its protection by the king . The monastery ceased to operate in 1835 : the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of <unk> enforced a law declaring that minor religious holdings housing fewer than 12 residents were to be forfeit to the state ; the monastery had only four monks and one lay brother , who were cast out . 
 = = = Vacancy = = = 
 After the Confiscations , many of the furnishings and artistic treasures of Santa María de Óvila passed to the surrounding parish churches , especially <unk> , Huet , <unk> de Tajo and <unk> de Tajo . Other valuables , such as books and historic documents , were stolen and sold . The remaining contents were auctioned , including wine @-@ making equipment and an oxcart . The precious 328 @-@ pages cartulary of the monastery ( Spanish : libro <unk> de Santa María de Óvila ) went to a private owner but was donated in 1925 to the Monastery of Santa María la Real of <unk> . The thick manuscript that hold copies of royal privileges granted to the monastery throughout its history and the <unk> , a comprehensive and thorough history of the Cistercian abbots and monks who lived in the monastery , was written from March 1729 to February 1730 by Father <unk> , a Cistercian monk of the monastery of Valparaíso ( <unk> ) . 
 The new owners of Santa María de Óvila were well @-@ to @-@ do farmers who cared little for the buildings . For a brief time , the former monastery was used as a hostel , but mainly , the buildings were subjected to hard agricultural use as barns sheltering livestock . The chapter house served as a manure pit . Other buildings were used as storage . In the early 20th century small trees were seen to be growing in the dirt packed atop the monastery roofs — the protective roof tiles had long since been taken down and sold . 
 = = = Removal to California = = = 
 In 1928 , the Spanish state sold the monastery to Fernando Beloso for a little more than 3 @,@ 100 pesetas , roughly $ 600 to $ 700 at the time . Beloso , director of the Spanish Credit Bank in Madrid , was the owner of Coto de San Bernardo in Óvila , which included expansive irrigated grain fields and forests surrounding the monastery . 
 Arthur Byne , an art agent living in Madrid , whose biggest client was American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst , was working for Hearst to acquire an old monastery in 1930 . In 1925 , Byne had bought Hearst the monastery of Santa María la Real de <unk> which was dismantled , crated and shipped to New York where it was stored in a warehouse in the Bronx . ( In 1954 it was re @-@ assembled in Florida as a tourist attraction , and was subsequently acquired by the Episcopal Diocese of South Florida and called the St. Bernard de Clairvaux Church . ) Byne signaled Beloso to help him locate one ; Beloso invited him to see the old Óvila monastery in December 1930 , and Byne subsequently sent photographs and sketches to Hearst for approval . Byne listed specific elements , mostly architectural details , to be removed , such as vault ribs , door frames , window embrasures , columns and capitals . Some entire walls of fine facing stones were recommended for removal . He referred to the proposal as " <unk> " , possibly to misdirect the Spanish authorities who were in charge of protecting historical artifacts . 
 After Hearst conveyed his enthusiasm for the project , Beloso sold Byne the stones for $ 85 @,@ 000 , including the cloister , the chapter house , the refectory and the dormitory for novices . With Byne 's commission , Hearst was to pay $ 97 @,@ 000 , a price roughly equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 34 million as of 2016 . Byne started immediately on the project , organizing men and materials , and beginning the removal of stones . Hearst 's main architect Julia Morgan sent her associate architect Walter T. Steilberg who arrived on March 9 , 1931 . Steilberg recommended that Hearst buy the old church portal , which he did , at Byne 's price of $ 1 @,@ 500 . Under the direction of Byne and Steilberg , the monastery was carefully labeled as it was dismantled stone by stone . Antonio Gomez , the local foreman praised by Byne and Steilberg , numbered the blocks on architectural drawings and painted the number in red on the back of each stone . 
 To move all the stones , Byne and Steilberg had a road built to the Tagus , and a barge attached to a fixed cable was assigned to ferry stones across . An old World War I trench railway was brought in to transport stones from the monastery to the ferry ; its rails could be laid into any of the buildings . Men pushed the small rail cars along the narrow gauge tracks ; the stones were then lifted into the ferry by crane , and another crane lifted them out of the ferry into trucks . One of the biggest problems that Byne encountered was that Spain 's three excelsior factories could not make enough packing material to keep the crate @-@ packing crew supplied . At one point , realizing that the stones were likely to be used in California as external cladding for structural steel walls , Steilberg suggested the facing surface of each stone be sliced to a " veneer " of the thickness of 6 inches ( 150 mm ) for easier packing and shipping , but Hearst wanted to retain the authenticity of the full @-@ sized stones . Byne and Steilberg judged certain walls and utility buildings worthless and left them in Spain . Steilberg returned home at the end of March . 
 Byne rushed the project in fear that it might be halted at any time by the authorities — Spanish law prohibited the removal of historic artifacts . However , the Spanish government was at that time in disarray and did not enforce the law . Government officials " simply looked the other way " as trucks hauled 700 @-@ year @-@ old stones through Valencia to the docks . When King Alfonso XIII abdicated in April 1931 , leaving the government in the control of the Second Republic , the new officials stopped the project . Byne 's lawyer persuaded the Minister of Labor to allow the work to continue on the grounds that the project employed more than a hundred men and put money into the severely depressed economy . 
 Doctor Francisco <unk> Serrano of nearby <unk> had for years tried to save the monastery but had failed to interest the government in the expensive preservation proposal . Realizing that this was his last chance to document the place as its stones were being removed , he wrote a monograph of its history and included a site plan of the layout of buildings , written from memory . As a result of his efforts , on June 3 , 1931 , Santa María de Óvila was listed as a National Monument of Spain , or Bien de Interés Cultural ( Cultural Property ) . <unk> Serrano published his monograph in 1932 . In 1933 , the monastery 's historic cartulary was brought to the University of Madrid and published ; the original was archived at the University of Oviedo . 
 By the time the dismantling was finished on July 1 , 1931 , some 10 @,@ 000 stones weighing a total of 2 @,@ 200 short tons ( 2 @,@ 000 t ) were shipped on 11 different freighters traveling through the Panama Canal to San Francisco . In 1931 currency , the monastery project had cost Hearst about one million dollars .

 Today , a few buildings remain of the original monastery in Spain . These include the winery or bodega , now the oldest surviving building on the site . This was built in the 13th century during the reign of Henry I of Castile , with the upper floor built as a dormitory 27 by 90 feet ( 8 @.@ 2 by 27 @.@ 4 m ) with a long barrel @-@ vaulted ceiling . Outside of the bodega , crumbling walls , open yards and part of the Gothic roof of the church are visible . The double arches in the walls of the Renaissance @-@ era cloister are still standing , but the arched roof is lost . The foundation of the church can be seen .

 Hearst first bought the monastery intending to replace the family retreat at Wyntoon , on the bank of the McCloud River near Mount Shasta in remote Northern California . The original building was his mother 's Bernard Maybeck @-@ designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929 . Hearst wanted to replace it with a great stone building fitted with towers and turrets — an eccentric castle folly that was to be larger than its predecessor . To prepare for the arrival of the Spanish stones , Morgan drew up plans with the monastery 's chapter house serving as the castle 's entrance hall , and the large church enclosing a swimming pool . Other stones were designated as cladding for walls and rooms on the ground floor . 
 At the Port of San Francisco , Steilberg inspected each shipment of stones , several thousand crates in all . The Haslett warehouse , between Fisherman 's Wharf and the Hyde Street Pier , was used for storage . With groundbreaking set for July 1931 and the last freighter carrying stones still in transit , Hearst stopped his grand plan for Wyntoon because his fortunes were too far reduced from the Great Depression . The stones stayed in the warehouse , incurring annual storage fees of $ 15 @,@ 000 in 1930s dollars . 
 = = = Golden Gate Park = = = 
 In 1940 , Hearst decided to give the monastery away . The government of Francisco Franco requested that it be returned to Spain , but Hearst refused . In August 1941 , Herbert <unk> , director of the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum , convinced Hearst to give the stones to the City of San Francisco in exchange for the city 's payment of his $ 25 @,@ 000 storage debt . Hearst stipulated the stones be used to construct a group of museum buildings adjoining the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park . The city moved the crates from the warehouse to store them outdoors behind the museum and the Japanese Tea Garden , allotting only $ 5 @,@ 000 for trucking and for building rough sheds and protective covers . The museum plan was estimated to cost $ 500 @,@ 000 , but that amount was not available . Morgan prepared several layouts for the city to approve , each with a different arrangement of the buildings than in Spain . However , in December 1941 , the U.S. was drawn into World War II and the museum plans were shelved . Picking up the project in 1946 , the city paid Morgan to construct a scale model of the complex of buildings which was to be the Museum of Medieval Arts , a West Coast version of The Cloisters in New York . 
 The city was unable to raise money to build the museum , and the stones were damaged in five fires . The first came soon after the crates were set down in Golden Gate Park . Morgan said that " piles of burning boxes were pulled over and down by the Fire Department , many hurled over a hundred and fifty feet . " Hearst died in 1951 , and Morgan died in 1957 ; neither of them saw anything built with the stones . Two fires in 1959 appeared to be arson , and many of the fire @-@ heated stones were weakened or cracked from sudden cooling by water . In 1960 , Steilberg was hired to inspect the stones once again ; he used a ball @-@ peen hammer to lightly strike each stone and listen for a solid ringing tone or a dull thud which indicated cracking . He found that a little more than half the stones were sound . 
 In 1965 , the Museum Society raised $ 40 @,@ 000 to mount the grand portal of the old church . It was installed in the de Young Museum , the centerpiece of Hearst Court , the main exhibit hall . The rest of the stones were abandoned by the museum in May 1969 when they announced that there would be no reconstruction . After this , stones were occasionally taken by park workers and used to decorate Golden Gate Park . 
 In 1989 or 1990 , a San Francisco city worker dumped an unused granite bollard amid the monastery stones ; the 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) tall bollard was once used as a traffic barrier . Some self @-@ styled Hindu park users led by performance artist Michael Bowen , calling himself Guru Baba Kali Das , began to worship the phallus @-@ shaped bollard as a lingam ; they wrestled some of the monastery 's stones into a religious circle , calling the circle Shiva Linga . The city sued to reclaim the area in 1993 , but lost the battle in court . In January 1994 the city arranged to move the traffic bollard to Bowen 's garage , serving as his temple . Bowen later offered the granite bollard for sale and admitted that the whole episode was a performance piece . 
 In 1999 , some of the stones were used to construct an outdoor reading terrace adjoining the Helen Crocker Russell Library of Horticulture , part of the <unk> Arboretum and Botanical Gardens in Golden Gate Park . Other stones were used for various purposes around Golden Gate Park and the Japanese Tea Garden , taken unofficially by park workers as they saw fit . Some of these ended up in the park 's AIDS Memorial Grove , others on a scent @-@ based flower walkway named Garden of Fragrance . 
 = = = University of San Francisco = = = 
 In 2002 , the old church portal was donated by the de Young Museum to the University of San Francisco ( a Jesuit university ) , and in 2008 it was associated with the construction of <unk> Hall . It serves as the backdrop of the outdoor Ovila Amphitheater ( 37 @.@ 7757 ° N 122 @.@ 451 ° W ﻿ / 37 @.@ 7757 ; <unk> ) , near an older Romanesque portal from Northern Italy . 
 = = = Abbey of New Clairvaux = = = 
 The Abbot @-@ Emeritus of the Abbey of New Clairvaux , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , first saw the stones and pictured them reassembled as a monastery on September 15 , 1955 — his first day in California . He arrived that day in San Francisco to serve as a new monk in Vina , California , at the monastery of Our Lady of New Clairvaux . The monastery belonged to <unk> of the order known as Cistercians of the Strict Observance . The monks farmed and worshiped on land once used by Leland Stanford to grow wine grapes . Davis 's superior met him at the airport and drove him through Golden Gate Park where he stopped to show Davis the stones sitting among the weeds . From time to time in subsequent years , Davis inspected the stones only to find them in increasingly poor condition . 
 In 1981 , architectural historian Margaret Burke began working under a grant from the Hearst Foundation to inventory the remaining stones . She said it was " an excavation project " because of the weeds , blackberry brambles and tree roots growing over them . Burke identified about 60 % of the stones belonging to the chapter house , a rectangular building originally spanning 31 by 46 feet ( 9 @.@ 4 by 14 @.@ 0 m ) . She separated the chapter house stones , surrounded them with a fence and began creating templates for rebuilding the arched entrances . During 1980 – 1982 the museum board sought $ 45 million for an expansion project that included $ 3 million for rebuilding the chapter house . Meanwhile , Davis asked a museum staff member for permission to take several truckloads of stones to Vina to be used for architectural decoration . Park workers helped him load the most ornate pieces he could find , and they were hauled away . Not told of the arrangement , Burke discovered that Davis had taken some of the chapter house stones , and the museum board insisted these be returned . Davis was left with 58 stones from other monastery buildings . 
 In 1983 and 1987 , Davis made unsuccessful requests for all of the chapter house stones . After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake , the de Young museum was to be rebuilt , and the future of the stones was reconsidered . In September 1993 , museum director Harry Parker joined with Davis to sign an unconditional permanent loan of the chapter house stones to New Clairvaux . In 1994 , the city approved the loan with the stipulation that the building be restored accurately and that it be occasionally open to the public . The stones were transported in 20 truckloads to Vina . Inside an old brick barn built by Stanford to make brandy , the stones began to be fitted together , laid flat on Burke 's plywood templates . 
 Ground was broken in 2003 on the site of an orchard ( 39 @.@ <unk> ° N 122 @.@ <unk> ° W ﻿ / 39 @.@ <unk> ; <unk> ) next to the main cloister building . Architect Patrick Cole of <unk> , overseeing the rebuilding project , said that there were more than half of the required stones for the chapter house . Of the missing stones , more than 90 % were repeating @-@ pattern stones with available templates to carve replacements . <unk> Oskar Kempf and Frank Helmholz used modern hydraulic lime as mortar rather than making their own as was done in the Middle Ages . Helmholz said of the opportunity offered by the project that it was " something most stonemasons don 't do in all their career . " 
 The strength of the building is twice what it was in Spain , with the stones supporting their own weight as designed , augmented by a framework of steel and concrete to hold them together when the California ground shakes . Contractor Phil Sunseri said that the building foundation was earthquake resistant as well ; with a three @-@ foot @-@ thick ( 1 m ) mat of concrete and steel underneath , " the entire building will move as one unit . " When completed , the building will be the largest example of original Cistercian Gothic architecture in the Western Hemisphere , and the oldest building in America west of the Rocky Mountains . 
 Nearby Sierra Nevada Brewing Company partnered with the monks of New Clairvaux to make a series of Belgian @-@ style beers under the Ovila Abbey brand . In late 2010 , the beer producer launched a website to tell about the making of the beer product line and the story of the restoration of the stones . Sierra Nevada founder Ken Grossman said he had long been interested in making a line of Belgian beers , and the abbey 's project provided a good opportunity . The first product , a <unk> , was released in March 2011 , followed in July by a Saison and in November by a <unk> . Sierra Nevada has dedicated a percentage of the beer sales to assist in funding the rebuilding project . 
 = Bruce Chatwin = 
 Charles Bruce Chatwin ( 13 May 1940 – 18 January 1989 ) was an English travel writer , novelist , and journalist . His first book , In Patagonia ( 1977 ) , established Chatwin as a travel writer , although he considered himself instead a storyteller , interested in bringing to light unusual tales . He won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel On the Black Hill ( 1982 ) and his novel Utz ( 1988 ) was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize . In 2008 The Times named Chatwin # 46 on their list of " 50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945 . " 
 Chatwin was born near Sheffield , England . At 18 he went to work at Sotheby ’ s in London , where he gained an extensive knowledge of art and eventually ran the auction house ’ s Antiquities and Impressionist Art departments . In 1966 he left Sotheby ’ s to read archaeology at the University of Edinburgh , but he abandoned his studies after two years to pursue a career as a writer . 
 The Sunday Times Magazine hired Chatwin in 1972 . He travelled the world for work and interviewed figures such as the politicians Indira Gandhi and André Malraux . He left the magazine in 1974 to visit Patagonia , which resulted in his first book . He produced five other books , including The Songlines ( 1987 ) , which was a bestseller . His work is credited with reviving the genre of travel writing , and his works influenced other writers such as William Dalrymple , Claudio Magris , Philip Marsden , Luis Sepúlveda , and Rory Stewart . 
 Married and bisexual , Chatwin was one of the first prominent men in Great Britain known to have contracted HIV and to have died of an AIDS @-@ related illness , although he hid the details . Following his death , the gay community criticised Chatwin for keeping his diagnosis secret .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 Bruce Chatwin was born on 13 May 1940 in the <unk> Road Nursing Home in Sheffield , England to Margharita ( née <unk> ) and Charles Chatwin . His mother Margharita had grown up in Sheffield and worked for the local Conservative party prior to her marriage . His father Charles was a lawyer from Birmingham who joined the Royal Naval Reserve following the outbreak of World War II . 
 Chatwin 's early years were spent moving regularly with his mother while his father was at sea . Prior to his birth , Chatwin 's parents had lived at <unk> Green , Worcestershire , but Margharita moved to her parents ' house in Dronfield , near Sheffield shortly before giving birth . Mother and son remained there for only a few weeks . Worried about Nazi bombs , she sought a safer place to stay . Margharita took her son with her as they travelled to stay with various relatives during the war . They would remain in one place until either Margharita decided to move out of concern for their safety , or because of friction among family members . Later in life Chatwin recalled of the war , " Home , if we had one , was a solid black suitcase called the Rev @-@ Robe , in which there was a corner for my clothes and my Mickey Mouse gas mask . " 
 During the war Chatwin and his mother stayed at the home of his paternal grandparents , who had a curiosity cabinet that fascinated him . Among the items it contained was a " piece of brontosaurus " ( actually a <unk> , a giant sloth ) , which had been sent to Chatwin 's grandmother by her cousin Charles Milward . Travelling in Patagonia , Milward had discovered the remains of a giant sloth , which he later sold to the British Museum . He sent his cousin a piece of the animal 's skin , and members of the family mistakenly referred to it as a " piece of brontosaurus . " The skin was later lost but it inspired Chatwin decades later to visit and write about Patagonia . 
 After the war , Chatwin lived with his parents and younger brother Hugh ( born in 1944 ) in West Heath in Birmingham , where his father had a law practice . He was educated at Old Hall School in Shropshire and Marlborough College , in Wiltshire . An unexceptional student , he garnered attention from his performances in school plays . While at Marlborough , Chatwin attained A @-@ levels in Latin , Greek , and Ancient History . 
 Chatwin had hoped to read Classics at Merton College , Oxford , but the end of National Service in the United Kingdom meant there was more competition for university places . He was forced to consider other options . His parents discouraged the ideas he offered — an acting career or work in the Colonial Service in Kenya . Instead , Chatwin 's father asked one of his clients for a letter of introduction to the auction house Sotheby 's . An interview was arranged , and Chatwin secured a job there . 
 = = = Art and archaeology = = = 
 In 1958 , Chatwin moved to London to begin work as a porter in the Works of Art department at Sotheby 's . Chatwin was ill @-@ suited for this job , which included dusting objects that had been kept in storage . Sotheby 's moved him to a junior <unk> position working in both the Antiquities and Impressionist Art departments . This position enabled him to develop his eye for art , and he quickly became known for his ability to discern forgeries . His work as a <unk> also taught him to describe objects in a concise manner and required that he research these objects . Chatwin advanced to become Sotheby 's expert on Antiquities and Impressionist art and would later run both departments . Many of Chatwin 's colleagues thought he would eventually become chairman of the auction house . 
 During this period Chatwin travelled extensively for his job and also for adventure . Travel offered him a relief from the British class system , which he found stifling . An admirer of Robert Byron and his book , The Road to <unk> , he travelled twice to Afghanistan . He also used these trips to visit markets and shops where he would buy antiques which he would resell at a profit in order to supplement his income from Sotheby 's . He became friends with artists and art collectors and dealers . One friend , Howard Hodgkin , painted Chatwin in The Japanese Screen ( 1962 ) . Chatwin said he was the " acid green smear on the left . " 
 Chatwin was ambivalent about his sexual orientation and had affairs with both men and women during this period of his life . One of his girlfriends , Elizabeth Chanler , an American and a descendent of John Jacob Astor , was a secretary at Sotheby 's . Chanler had earned a degree in history from Radcliffe College and worked at Sotheby 's New York offices for two years before transferring to their London office in 1961 . Her love of travel and independent nature appealed to Chatwin . 
 In the mid @-@ 1960s Chatwin grew unhappy at Sotheby 's . There were various reasons for his disenchantment . Both women and men found Chatwin attractive , and Peter Wilson , then chairman of Sotheby 's , used this appeal to the auction house 's advantage when using Chatwin to try to persuade wealthy individuals to sell their art collections . Chatwin became increasingly uncomfortable with the situation . Later in life Chatwin also spoke of having become " burnt out " and said , " In the end I felt I might just as well be working for a rather superior funeral parlour . One 's whole life seemed to be spent valuing for probate the apartment of somebody recently dead . " 
 In late 1964 he began to suffer from problems with his sight , which he attributed to the close analysis of artwork entailed by his job . He consulted eye specialist Patrick Trevor @-@ Roper , who diagnosed a latent squint and recommended that Chatwin take a six @-@ month break from his work at Sotheby 's . Trevor @-@ Roper had been involved in the design of an eye hospital in Addis Ababa , and suggested Chatwin visit east Africa . In February 1965 , Chatwin left for Sudan . It was on this trip that Chatwin first encountered a nomadic tribe ; their way of life intrigued him . " My nomadic guide , " he wrote , " carried a sword , a purse and a pot of scented goat 's grease for anointing his hair . He made me feel overburdened and inadequate ... " Chatwin would remain fascinated by nomads for the rest of his life . 
 Chatwin returned to Sotheby 's and , to the surprise of his friends , proposed marriage to Elizabeth Chanler . They married on 21 August 1965 . Chatwin was bisexual throughout their married life , a circumstance Elizabeth knew and accepted . Chatwin had hoped he would " grow out of " his homosexual behaviour and have a successful marriage like his parents . During their marriage , Chatwin had many affairs , mostly with men . Some who were aware of Chatwin 's affairs with men assumed the <unk> had a chaste marriage but , according to Nicholas Shakespeare , the author 's biographer , this was not true . Both Chatwin and his wife had hoped to have children , but they remained childless . 
 In April 1966 , at the age of 26 , Chatwin was promoted to a director of Sotheby 's , a position to which he had aspired . To his disappointment , he was made a junior director and lacked voting rights on the board . This disappointment , along with boredom and increasing discomfort over potentially illegal side deals taking place at Sotheby 's , including the sale of objects from the Pitt @-@ Rivers museum collection , led Chatwin to resign from his Sotheby 's post in June 1966 . 
 Chatwin enrolled in October 1966 at the University of Edinburgh to study Archaeology . He had regretted not attending Oxford and had been contemplating going to university for a few years . A visit in December 1965 to the Hermitage in Leningrad sparked his interest in the field of archaeology . Despite winning the Wardrop Prize for the best first year 's work , he found the rigour of academic archaeology tiresome , and he left after two years without taking a degree . 
 = = = The Nomadic Alternative = = = 
 Following his departure from Edinburgh , Chatwin decided to pursue a career as a writer , successfully pitching a book proposal on nomads to Tom Maschler , publisher at Jonathan Cape . Chatwin tentatively titled the book The Nomadic Alternative and sought to answer the question " Why do men wander rather than stand still ? " Chatwin delivered the manuscript in 1972 , and Maschler declined to publish it , calling it a " chore to read . " 
 Between 1969 and 1972 , as he was working on The Nomadic Alternative , Chatwin travelled extensively and pursued other endeavours in an attempt to establish a creative career . He co @-@ curated an exhibit on Nomadic Art of the Asian Steppes , which opened at Asia House Gallery in New York City in 1970 . He considered publishing an account of his 1969 trip to Afghanistan with Peter Levi . Levi published his own book about it , The Light Garden of the Angel King : Journeys in Afghanistan ( 1972 ) . Chatwin contributed two articles on nomads to Vogue and another article to History Today . 
 In the early 1970s Chatwin had an affair with James Ivory , a film director . He pitched stories to him for possible films , which Ivory did not take seriously . In 1972 Chatwin tried his hand at film @-@ making and travelled to Niger to make a documentary about nomads . The film was lost while Chatwin was trying to sell it to European television companies . 
 Chatwin also took photographs of his journeys and attempted to sell photographs from a trip to Mauritania to The Sunday Times Magazine . While The Times did not accept those photographs for publication , it did offer Chatwin a job . 
 = = = The Sunday Times Magazine and In Patagonia = = = 
 In 1972 , The Sunday Times Magazine hired Chatwin as an adviser on art and architecture . Initially his role was to suggest story ideas and put together features such as " One Million Years of Art , " which ran in several issues during the summer of 1973 . His editor , Francis Wyndham , encouraged him to write , which allowed him to develop his narrative skills . Chatwin travelled on many international assignments , writing on such subjects as Algerian migrant workers and the Great Wall of China , and interviewing such diverse people as André Malraux , Maria Reiche , and Madeleine Vionnet . 
 In 1972 , Chatwin interviewed the 93 @-@ year @-@ old architect and designer Eileen Gray in her Paris salon , where he noticed a map she had painted of the area of South America called Patagonia . " I 've always wanted to go there , " Chatwin told her . " So have I , " she replied , " Go there for me . " 
 Two years later , in November 1974 , Chatwin flew out to Lima in Peru and reached Patagonia a month later . He would later claim that he sent a telegram to Wyndham merely stating : " Have gone to Patagonia . " Actually he sent a letter : " I am doing a story there for myself , something I have always wanted to write up . " This marked the end of Chatwin 's role as a regular writer for The Sunday Times Magazine , although in subsequent years he contributed occasional pieces , including a profile of Indira Gandhi . 
 Chatwin spent six months in Patagonia , travelling around gathering stories of people who came from elsewhere and settled there . This trip resulted in the book , In Patagonia ( 1977 ) . He used his quest for his own " piece of brontosaurus " ( the one from his grandparents ' cabinet had been thrown away years earlier ) to frame the story of his trip . Chatwin described In Patagonia as " the narrative of an actual journey and a symbolic one ... It is supposed to fall into the category or be a spoof of Wonder Voyage : the narrator goes to a far country in search of a strange animal : on his way he lands in strange situations , people or other books tell him strange stories which add up to form a message . " 
 In Patagonia contains fifteen black and white photographs by Chatwin . According to Susannah Clapp , who edited the book , " Rebecca West amused Chatwin by telling him that these were so good they rendered superfluous the entire text of the book . " 
 This work established Chatwin 's reputation as a travel writer . One of his biographers , Nicholas Murray , called In Patagonia " one of the most strikingly original postwar English travel books " and said that it revitalised the genre of travel writing . However , residents in the region contradicted the account of events depicted in Chatwin 's book . It was the first time in his career , but not the last , that conversations and characters which Chatwin presented as fact were later alleged to be fiction . 
 For In Patagonia Chatwin received the Hawthornden Prize and the E. M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters . Graham Greene , Patrick Leigh Fermor , and Paul Theroux praised the book . As a result of the success of In Patagonia , Chatwin 's circle of friends expanded to include individuals such as Jacqueline Onassis , Susan Sontag , and Jasper Johns .

 Upon his return from Patagonia , Chatwin discovered a change in leadership at The Sunday Times Magazine and his retainer was not continued . Chatwin intended his next project to be a biography of Francisco Félix de Sousa , a nineteenth @-@ century slave trader born in Brazil who became the Viceroy of Ouidah in Dahomey ( present day Benin ) . Chatwin had first heard of de Sousa during a visit to Dahomey in 1972 . He returned to the country , by then renamed the People 's Republic of Benin , in December 1976 to conduct research . In January 1977 a coup took place , and Chatwin was accused of being a mercenary , arrested , and detained for three days . Chatwin later wrote about this experience in " A Coup — A Story , " which was published in Granta and included in What Am I Doing Here ( 1989 ) . 
 Following his arrest and release Chatwin left Benin and went to Brazil to continue his research on de Sousa . Frustrated by the lack of documented information on de Sousa , Chatwin chose instead to write a fictionalised biography of him . This book was published in 1980 , and Werner Herzog 's film , Cobra Verde ( 1987 ) , is based on it . 
 Although The Viceroy of Ouidah received good reviews , it did not sell well . Nicholas Shakespeare said that the dismal sales caused Chatwin to pursue a completely different subject for his next book . In response to his growing reputation as a travel writer Chatwin said he " decided to write something about people who never went out . " His next book , On the Black Hill ( 1982 ) , is a novel of twin brothers who live all of their lives in a farmhouse on the Welsh borders . For this book Chatwin won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Whitbread Prize for Best First Novel , even though he considered his previous book , The Viceroy of Ouidah , a novel . It was made into a film in 1987 . 
 In the late 1970s Chatwin spent an increasing amount of time in New York City . He continued to have affairs with men , but most of these affairs were short @-@ lived . In 1977 he began his first serious affair with Donald Richards , an Australian stockbroker . Richards introduced him to the gay nightclub scene in New York . During this period Chatwin became acquainted with Robert Mapplethorpe , who photographed him . Chatwin is one of the few men Mapplethorpe photographed fully clothed . Chatwin later contributed the introduction to a book of Mapplethorpe 's photographs , Lady , Lisa Lyon ( 1983 ) . 
 Although Elizabeth Chatwin had accepted her husband 's affairs , their relationship deteriorated in the late 1970s , and in 1980 she asked for a separation . By 1982 Chatwin 's affair with Richards had ended and he began another serious affair with Jasper Conran . 
 = = = The Songlines = = = 
 In 1983 Chatwin returned to the topic of nomads and decided to focus on Aboriginal Australians . He was influenced by the work of Theodore Strehlow , author of Songs of Central Australia and a controversial figure . Strehlow had collected and recorded Aboriginal songs , and shortly before his death in 1978 , he sold photographs of secret Aboriginal initiation ceremonies to a magazine . 
 Chatwin went to Australia to learn more about Aboriginal culture , specifically the songlines or dreaming tracks . Each <unk> is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map , and each Aboriginal Australian has their own <unk> . Chatwin thought the songlines could be a metaphor he could use to support his ideas about humans ' need to wander , which he believed was genetic . However , he struggled to fully understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture . This was due to Chatwin 's approach to learning about the songlines . He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia , during which he primarily relied on non @-@ Aboriginal people for information . Chatwin was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages . He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement , and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow 's work . 
 While in Australia , Chatwin , who had been experiencing some health problems , first read about AIDS , then known as the gay plague . It frightened him and compelled him to reconcile with his wife . The fear of AIDS also drove him to finish the book that became The Songlines ( 1987 ) . His friend the novelist Salman Rushdie said , " That book was an obsession too great for him ... His illness did him a favour , got him free of it . Otherwise , he would have gone on writing it for ten years . " 
 The Songlines features a narrator named Bruce whose biography is almost identical to Chatwin 's . The narrator spends time in Australia trying to learn about Aboriginal culture , specifically the songlines . As the book goes on , it becomes a reflection on what Chatwin stated was " for me , the question of questions : the nature of human restlessness . " Chatwin also hinted at his preoccupation over his own mortality in the text : " I had a <unk> that the ' travelling ' phase of my life might be passing ... I should set down on paper a resume of the ideas , quotations , and encounters that amused me and obsessed me ... " Following this statement in The Songlines Chatwin included extensive excerpts from his moleskine notebooks . 
 Chatwin published The Songlines in 1987 , and it became a bestseller in both the United Kingdom and the United States . The book was nominated for the Thomas Cook Travel Award , but Chatwin requested that it be withdrawn from consideration , saying the work was fictional . Following its publication , Chatwin became friends with composer Kevin Volans , who was inspired to base a theatre score on the book . The project evolved into an opera , The Man with <unk> of Wind ( 1993 ) . 
 = = = Illness and final works = = = 
 While at work on The Songlines between 1983 and 1986 , Chatwin frequently came down with colds . He also developed skin lesions that may have been symptoms of Kaposi 's sarcoma . After finishing The Songlines in August 1986 , Chatwin went to Switzerland , where he collapsed on the street . At a clinic there , he was diagnosed as HIV @-@ positive . Chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to how he might have contracted HIV , including from a gang rape in Dahomey or possibly from Sam Wagstaff , the patron and lover of Robert Mapplethorpe . 
 Chatwin 's case was unusual as he had a fungal infection , Penicillium <unk> , which at the time had rarely been seen and only in South Asia . It is now known as an AIDS @-@ defining illness , but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS . Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV developed into AIDS . The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that he might be different and served as the basis of what he told most people about his illness . He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus — ranging from eating a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia . He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV @-@ positive because of the stigma at the time . He wanted to protect his parents , who were unaware of his homosexual affairs . 
 Although he never spoke or wrote publicly about his disease , in one instance he did write about the AIDS epidemic in 1988 in a letter to the editor of the London Review of Books : 
 " The word ' Aids ' is one of the cruellest and silliest neologisms of our time . ' Aid ' means help , succour , comfort — yet with a hissing sibilant tacked onto the end it becomes a nightmare ... HIV ( Human <unk> @-@ Deficiency Virus ) is a perfectly easy name to live with . ' Aids ' causes panic and despair and has probably done something to facilitate the spread of the disease . " 
 During his illness , Chatwin continued to write . Elizabeth encouraged him to use a letter he had written to her from Prague in 1967 as an inspiration for a new story . During this trip , he had met Konrad Just , an art collector . This meeting and the letter to Elizabeth served as the basis for Chatwin 's next work . Utz ( 1988 ) was a novel about the obsession that leads people to collect . Set in Prague , the novel details the life and death of Kaspar Utz , a man obsessed with his collection of Meissen porcelain . Utz was well @-@ received and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize . 
 Chatwin also edited a collection of his journalism , which was published as What Am I Doing Here ( 1989 ) . At the time of his death in 1989 , he was working on a number of new ideas for future novels , including a transcontinental epic provisionally titled Lydia Livingstone . 
 Chatwin died at a hospital in Nice on 18 January 1989 . A memorial service was held in the Greek Orthodox Church of Saint Sophia in West London on 14 February 1989 , the same day that a fatwa was announced on Salman Rushdie , a close friend of Chatwin 's , who attended the service . Paul Theroux , who also attended the service , later commented on it and Chatwin in a piece for Granta . The novelist Martin Amis described the memorial service in the essay " Salman Rushdie " , included in his anthology Visiting Mrs Nabokov . 
 Chatwin 's ashes were scattered near a Byzantine chapel above <unk> in the Peloponnese . This was close to the home of one of his mentors , the writer Patrick Leigh Fermor . Near here , Chatwin had spent several months in 1985 working on The Songlines . 
 Chatwin 's papers , including 85 moleskine notebooks , were given to the Bodleian Library , Oxford . Two collections of his photographs and excerpts from the moleskine notebooks were published as Photographs and Notebooks ( US title : Far Journeys ) in 1993 and Winding Paths in 1999 . 
 News of Chatwin 's AIDS diagnosis first surfaced in September 1988 . However , at the time of his death , obituaries referred to Chatwin 's statements about a rare fungal infection . Following his death , members of the gay community criticised Chatwin for lacking the courage to reveal the true nature of his illness , which some people think would have raised public awareness of AIDS , as he was one of the first high @-@ profile individuals in Great Britain known to have contracted HIV . 
 = = Writing style = = 
 John Updike described Chatwin 's writing as " a clipped , lapidary prose that compresses worlds into pages " , while one of Chatwin 's editors , Susannah Clapp , wrote , " Although his syntax was pared down , his words were not @-@ or at least not only @-@ plain . ... His prose is both spare and flamboyant . " Chatwin 's writing was shaped by his work as a <unk> at Sotheby 's , which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers . In addition , Chatwin 's interest in nomads also influenced his writing . One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had . Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense , and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing . He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose . 
 In his writing Chatwin experimented with format . With In Patagonia , Clapp said Chatwin described the book 's structure of 97 vignettes as " Cubist . " " [ I ] n other words , " she said , " lots of small pictures tilting away and toward each other to create this strange original portrait of Patagonia . " The Songlines was another attempt by Chatwin to experiment with format . The book begins as a novel narrated by a man named Bruce but about two @-@ thirds of the way through it becomes a commonplace book filled with quotations , anecdotes , and summaries of others ' research in an attempt to explore human restlessness . Some of Chatwin 's critics did not think he succeeded in The Songlines with this approach , although others applauded his effort at trying an unconventional structure . 
 Several nineteenth and twentieth century writers influenced Chatwin 's work . The work of Robert Byron had an impact on Chatwin , who admitted to imitating his style when he first began making notes of his own travels . While in Patagonia he read In Our Time by Ernest Hemingway . Chatwin admired Hemingway for his spare prose . While writing In Patagonia , Chatwin strove to approach his writing as a " literary Cartier @-@ Bresson . " Chatwin 's biographer described the resulting prose as " quick snapshots of ordinary people . " Along with Hemingway and Cartier @-@ Bresson , Osip Mandelstam 's work strongly influenced Chatwin during the writing of In Patagonia . An admirer of Noël Coward , Chatwin found the breakfast scene in Private Lives helpful in learning to write dialogue . Once Chatwin began work on The Viceroy of Ouidah , he began studying the work of nineteenth @-@ century French authors , such as Honoré de Balzac and Gustave Flaubert . These writers would continue to influence Chatwin for the remainder of his life . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Chatwin explored several different themes in his work . They include human restlessness and wandering ; borders and exile ; and art and objects . 
 Chatwin considered the question of human restlessness to be the focus of his writing . He ultimately aspired to explore this subject in order to answer what he believed was a fundamental question about human existence . He thought humans were meant to be a migratory species but once they settled in one place , their natural urges " found outlets in violence , greed , status @-@ seeking or a mania for the new . " In his first attempt at writing a book , The Nomadic Alternative , Chatwin had tried to compose an academic exposition on nomadic culture , which he believed was unexamined and unappreciated . With this volume Chatwin had hoped to answer the question " Why do men wander rather than sit still ? " In his book proposal he admitted that the interest in the subject was personal : " Why do I become restless after a month in a single place , unbearable after two ? " 
 Although Chatwin did not succeed with The Nomadic Alternative , he returned to the topic of restlessness and wandering in his subsequent books . Writer Jonathan Chatwin ( no relation ) stated that Chatwin 's works can be grouped into two categories : " restlessness defined " and " restlessness explained . " Most of his work focuses on describing restlessness , such as in the case of one twin in On the Black Hill who longs to leave home . Another example is the protagonist of Utz , who feels restless to escape to Vichy each year but always returns to Prague . Chatwin attempted to explain restlessness in The Songlines , which focused on the Aboriginal Australians ' walkabout . For this work , he returned to his research from The Nomadic Alternative . 
 Borders are another theme in Chatwin 's work . According to Elizabeth Chatwin , he " was interested in borders , where things were always changing , not one thing or another . " Patagonia , the subject of his first published book , is an area that is in both Argentina and Chile . The Viceroy of Ouidah is a Brazilian who trades slaves in Dahomey . On the Black Hills takes place on the borders of Wales and England . In The Songlines the characters the protagonist mostly interacts with are people who provide a bridge between the Aboriginal and white Australian worlds . The main character in Utz travels back and forth across the Iron Curtain . 
 " The theme of exile , of people living at the margins ... is treated in a literal and metaphorical sense throughout Chatwin 's work , " stated Nicholas Murray . He identified several examples in Chatwin 's work . There were people who were actual exiles , such as some of those profiled in In Patagonia and the Viceroy of Ouidah , who was unable to return to Brazil . Murray also cited the main characters in On the Black Hill , " although not strictly exiles ... [ they ] were exiles from the major events of their time and its dominant values . " Similarly , Murray wrote , Utz is " trapped in a society whose values are not his own but which he cannot bring himself to leave . " 
 Chatwin returned to the subject of art and objects during his career . In his early writing for the Sunday Times Magazine , he wrote about art and artists , and many of these articles Chatwin included in What Am I Doing Here . The main focus of Utz is on the impact the possession of art ( in this case porcelain figures ) has on a collector . Utz 's unwillingness to give up his porcelain collection kept him in Czechoslovakia even though he had the opportunity to live in the West . Chatwin constantly struggled with the conflicting desires to own beautiful items and to live in a space free of unnecessary objects . His distaste for the art world was the result of his days at Sotheby 's , and some of his final writing focused on this . The final section of What Am I Doing Here , " Tales from the Art World , " consists of four short stories on this topic . At the end of What Am I Doing Here , Chatwin shares an anecdote about advice he had received from Noël Coward , who told him " Never let anything artistic stand in your way . " Chatwin stated , " I 've always acted on that advice . " 
 = = Influence = = 
 With the publication of In Patagonia , Chatwin invigorated the genre of travel writing ; according to his biographer , Nicholas Murray , he " showed that an inventive writer could breathe new life into an old genre . " The combination of his clear yet vivid prose and an international perspective at a time when many English writers were more focused on home instead of abroad helped to set him apart . Aside from his writing , Chatwin was also good looking , and his image as a dashing traveller added to his appeal and helped make him a celebrity . In the eyes of younger writers such as Rory Stewart , Chatwin " made [ travel writing ] cool . " In The New York Times , Andrew Harvey wrote , 
 " Nearly every writer of my generation in England has wanted , at some point , to be Bruce Chatwin ; wanted , like him , to talk of Fez and <unk> , Nigeria and Nuristan , with equal authority ; wanted to be talked about , as he is , with raucous envy ; wanted above all to have written his books . " 
 Chatwin 's books also inspired some readers to visit Patagonia and Australia . As a result of his work , Patagonia experienced an increase in tourism , and it became a common sight for tourists to appear in the region , carrying a copy of In Patagonia . The Songlines also inspired readers to travel to Australia and seek out the people Chatwin had based his characters on , much to their consternation , as he had failed to disclose to these individuals his intentions . 
 Beyond travel , Chatwin influenced other writers , such as Claudio Magris , Luis Sepúlveda , Philip Marsden , and William Dalrymple . Nicholas Shakespeare stated that part of Chatwin 's impact was that his work was difficult to categorise and it helped " set free other writers ... [ from ] conventional boundaries . Although he was often called a travel writer , he did not identify as one nor did he consider himself a novelist . ( " I don 't quite know the meaning of the word novel , " he said ) . He preferred to call his writing stories or searches . He was interested in asking big questions about human existence , sharing unusual tales , and making connections between ideas from various sources . His friend and fellow writer Robyn Davidson said , " He posed questions we all want answered and perhaps gave the illusion they were answerable . " 
 = = = Posthumous Influence = = = 
 According to his biographer Nicholas Shakespeare , Chatwin 's work developed a cult @-@ like following in the years immediately following his death . By 1998 one million copies of his books had been sold . However , his reputation diminished following revelations about his personal life and questions about the accuracy of his work . 
 Questions about the accuracy of his work existed prior to his death , and Chatwin had admitted to " counting up the lies " in In Patagonia , though he stated there were not many . While researching Chatwin 's life , Nicholas Shakespeare stated he found " few cases of mere invention " in In Patagonia . Mostly , these tended to be instances of embellishment , such as when Chatwin wrote of a nurse who loved the work of Osip Mandelstam - one of his favorite authors - when in fact she was a fan of Agatha Christie . When Michael Ignatieff asked Chatwin his opinion of what divided fact from fiction , he replied , " I don 't think there is [ a division ] . " 
 Some individuals profiled in In Patagonia were unhappy with Chatwin 's portrayals of them . They included one man whom Chatwin insinuated was homosexual and a woman who thought her father was unjustly accused of killing Indians . However , Chatwin 's biographer found one farmer who was featured in the book who thought Chatwin 's depictions of himself and other members of his community were truthful . He stated , " No one likes looking at their own passport photograph , but I found it accurate . It 's not flattering , but it 's the truth . " 
 Chatwin 's bestseller , The Songlines , has been the focus of much criticism . Some critics describe his viewpoint as " colonialist " , citing his lack of interviews with Aboriginals and his reliance instead on white Australians for information about Aboriginal culture . Other criticism comes from anthropologists and other researchers who spent years studying Aboriginal culture and who dismiss Chatwin 's work because he visited Australia briefly . There are others , such as writer Thomas Keneally , who believe The Songlines should be widely read in Australia , where many people had not previously heard of the songlines . 
 The questions about the veracity of Chatwin 's writing are compounded by the revelation of his sexual orientation and the true cause of his death . Once it became known that Chatwin had been bisexual and had died of an AIDS @-@ related illness , some critics viewed him as a liar and dismissed his work . Nicholas Shakespeare said , " His denial [ of his AIDS diagnosis ] bred a sense that if he lied about his life , he must have lied about his work . Some readers have taken this as a cue to pass judgement on his books – or else not to bother with them . " In 2010 The Guardian 's review of Under the Sun : The Letters of Bruce Chatwin opened with the question , " Does anyone read Bruce Chatwin these days ? " However , Rory Stewart has stated , " His personality , his learning , his myths , and even his prose are less hypnotizing [ than they once were ] . And yet he remains a great writer , of deep and enduring importance . ” In 2008 The Times named Chatwin # 46 on their list of " 50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945 " . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Chatwin 's name is used to sell <unk> notebooks . Chatwin wrote in The Songlines of little black <unk> @-@ covered notebooks that he bought in Paris and which he called " <unk> " . The quotes and anecdotes he had compiled in these books serve as a major section of The Songlines . In this book Chatwin mourned the closing of the last producer of these books . In 1995 , Marta <unk> read The Songlines and proposed to her employer , Modo & Modo , an Italian design and publishing company , that they produce moleskine notebooks . In 1997 , the company began to sell these books and used Chatwin 's name to promote them . Modo & Modo was sold in 2006 , and the company became known as <unk> <unk> . 
 In 2014 the clothing label Burberry produced a collection inspired by Chatwin 's books . The following year Burberry released a limited edition set of Chatwin 's books with specially designed covers .
