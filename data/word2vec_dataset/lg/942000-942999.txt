 With the Wildcats ' record sitting at 11 – 13 overall and 6 – 6 in conference play headed into a February road game against conference leader LSU , Farmer remained in Lexington with a combination of a stomach virus and the flu . Teammates LaRon Ellis , Chris Mills , and Derrick Miller had also been ill , but all recovered in time to make the trip . Farmer shot just 2 of 14 in limited minutes in the month of February . In Kentucky 's final home game of the season , Farmer hit a three @-@ pointer – his only points of the game – with two seconds left to lift the Wildcats to a 70 – 69 win over Ole Miss . The following game , Farmer missed a potentially game @-@ winning 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) jump shot at the buzzer in a 68 – 67 loss at Mississippi State to end the Wildcats ' regular season . In its first game of the Southeastern Conference Tournament the next week , Kentucky lost to Vanderbilt 77 – 63 in a game where Farmer missed all four of his field goal attempts . Finishing with a 13 – 19 record – the team 's worst record since the 1926 @-@ 27 season – the Wildcats were not invited to any postseason tournament . At the team 's annual postseason awards banquet , Farmer received the free throw award .

 Between Farmer 's freshman and sophomore years , the NCAA banned Eric Manuel from playing in any further NCAA games because of questions about the legitimacy of his ACT scores and levied a two @-@ year postseason ban , a one @-@ year ban on televised games , and scholarship reductions against Kentucky as punishment for payments allegedly made to the father of Chris Mills . Mills was ruled ineligible to play at Kentucky and transferred to Arizona ; Sean Sutton and LaRon Ellis also transferred to other schools in the wake of the sanctions . Eddie Sutton resigned and was replaced by New York Knicks head coach Rick Pitino . After recruit Henry Thomas suffered an off @-@ season injury to his anterior cruciate ligament , Kentucky was left with just 8 scholarship players , none of whom were taller than 6 ft 8 in ( 2 @.@ 03 m ) . 
 Pitino and newly hired strength and conditioning coach Rock Oliver instituted an intensive conditioning program . The Lexington Herald @-@ Leader noted that Farmer lost 12 pounds ( 5 @.@ 4 kg ) in the off @-@ season , reducing his weight to 168 pounds ( 76 kg ) , and Pitino praised his improved speed and endurance . Pitino also brought Billy Donovan – who played point guard on Pitino 's teams at Providence – to Kentucky as a graduate assistant to mentor the team 's two point guards , Farmer and Sean Woods ( now academically eligible ) . 
 The team 's first intra @-@ squad scrimmage showcased Pitino 's fast @-@ paced , three @-@ point @-@ heavy style ; the two teams combined to shoot 98 @-@ of @-@ 175 from the field , including 23 @-@ of @-@ 57 from three , as the Blue team defeated the White team 145 – 85 . Farmer led the White team ( the projected reserves ) in scoring with 26 points , including 5 @-@ of @-@ 13 shooting from three @-@ point range . In the next scrimmage , played at Farmer 's alma mater , Clay County High School , Farmer scored 32 points , but the White team lost to the Blue team again , 125 – 117 . The teams again combined for 175 shots , and Pitino said before the game that he wanted both teams to exceed 120 points . Farmer sat out much of the second half of the final scrimmage due to illness but scored 17 points on 5 @-@ of @-@ 16 shooting in a 124 – 120 victory for the White team . 
 After Kentucky 's second game of the year – a 71 – 69 loss at Indiana – Pitino noted that Farmer , who had 4 points and 4 assists in the game , was benefiting from extra one @-@ on @-@ one coaching sessions with Donovan . In a December 19 , 1989 , victory against Furman , Farmer attempted 7 three @-@ pointers – tied for second @-@ most in the game – as the Wildcats set an NCAA record for most three @-@ pointers attempted in a game with 47 , besting their own record of 41 set earlier in the month against Tennessee Tech . A week later , Farmer set a career @-@ high in points with 21 – including three made three @-@ pointers – as the Wildcats set records for the most three @-@ pointers made in a single game ( 21 ) and most points ever scored against North Carolina , but lost the game 121 – 110 . After the game , Pitino opined that Farmer " holds back a little bit " and noted that he would expect Farmer to work hard in the off @-@ season to reach his potential . The Wildcats closed out 1989 with a closer @-@ than @-@ expected 86 – 79 loss against eighth @-@ ranked Louisville , but local sportswriter John McGill said Farmer had his best game to date with 10 points , 9 assists and 3 steals off the bench . 
 In a January 20 , 1990 , contest against conference foe Tennessee , Pitino benched senior shooting guard Derrick Miller to start the second half , giving his spot to Farmer . Farmer , who had no assists and 4 turnovers in nine minutes during the first half , responded with 7 assists and only one turnover in the second half . Miller , who entered the game with 17 : 38 left , scored 17 points in the second half as the Wildcats turned a 44 – 39 halftime deficit into a 95 – 83 win . Miller credited Pitino 's decision to bring him off the bench in the second half with taking the pressure off him and helping him get more comfortable in the game . After a mid @-@ week loss to Auburn , Pitino announced that he would move Farmer into the starting lineup , replacing Sean Woods , for the Wildcats ' January 27 contest against Ole Miss . " We will change the lineup to try to get more concentration . We 'll try Richie Farmer at the point and see what we get out of that . Right now we 're not getting too much out of that position , " Pitino told reporters during an SEC teleconference . In a 98 – 79 victory , Farmer tallied 11 points , 2 assists and no turnovers in 24 minutes ; Woods registered 8 points , 4 assists , and 2 turnovers in 23 minutes off the bench . Pitino said practice performance would determine whether Woods or Farmer would start the Wildcats ' next game against Mississippi State , and he ultimately decided to return Woods to the starting rotation . 
 On February 15 , 1990 , in front of a record 24 @,@ 301 fans at Rupp Arena , Farmer hit six consecutive free throws to help Kentucky overcome a career @-@ high 41 points by LSU 's Chris Jackson and pull within a half @-@ game of first place in the SEC with a 100 – 95 win . Farmer entered the game after Sean Woods fouled out with 1 : 54 left , and with Kentucky leading by two with just over a minute left , LSU coach Dale Brown instructed his team to foul Farmer on each Kentucky possession to conserve the game clock and regain possession of the ball . " We felt Farmer did not have much experience , and he was playing a little tight , " Brown said after the game . Told of Brown 's instructions to foul Farmer – the team 's best free throw shooter at 86 % – during a post @-@ game interview , Pitino expressed surprise . " [ Brown ] said he purposely wanted to foul Richie Farmer ? What was his reason ? ... If I had to pick a guy to shoot it in front of 50 @,@ 000 people with your life at stake , it 's going to be Richie Farmer shooting that free throw . " 
 Less than two minutes into a subsequent game at Alabama , Farmer and walk @-@ on Tony Cooper both left the bench when Kentucky 's Reggie Hanson and Alabama 's Robert Horry engaged in a fist @-@ fight . Hansen , Horry and Cooper were all ejected , but Farmer was not . Asked about the difference in penalties for Cooper and Farmer , official Don Ferguson admitted he did not want to hurt Kentucky 's shallow rotation any further by ejecting another regular contributor . As a token of appreciation to the fans , after the Wildcats ' February 24 " Senior Day " win over Auburn , Pitino called his players back onto the floor and presented the individual awards usually reserved for the team 's annual awards banquet . Farmer received the " Best Free Throw Shooter " award . For the season , he averaged 7 @.@ 0 points per game . Fans and the media nicknamed the team " Pitino 's <unk> " for their fast @-@ paced offense that relied heavily on the three @-@ point shot , which contrasted sharply with the more deliberate offensive schemes run by Pitino 's immediate predecessors , Joe B. Hall and Eddie Sutton . 
 = = = Junior = = = 
 In September 1990 , Farmer had a disagreement with strength coach Rock Oliver , returned home to Manchester , and considered leaving the Kentucky basketball team . Pitino , who was away from campus on a recruiting visit , called Farmer and scheduled a meeting with him for the following weekend , after which Farmer decided to return to the team . Pitino characterized the incident as " a case of someone getting down and needing a couple of hugs to get their spirits lifted a little bit " . Pitino later added that he thought the transfer of point guard Travis Ford from Missouri – bringing additional competition in the backcourt for the 1991 – 92 season – may have played into Farmer 's brief departure . 
 Pitino expressed uncertainty entering the season about who would replace Derrick Miller as the team 's starting shooting guard . Farmer was the leading candidate until suffering a bruised kidney during a public intra @-@ squad scrimmage in early November and <unk> the injury during another public scrimmage days later . Sophomore Jeff Brassow got the start for the Wildcats in their season opening win against Penn . Farmer scored 12 points off the bench – one of six Wildcats with double @-@ digit points – but left the game with 3 : 17 remaining after taking an inadvertent elbow in the back . In the next game against Cincinnati , Farmer briefly replaced starter Sean Woods at point guard after Woods committed eight turnovers in the first half , but Farmer fared little better , committing two turnovers and uncharacteristically missing two consecutive free throws . In the second half , after Woods picked up his fourth foul , Farmer entered the game and provided steady leadership to preserve a 75 – 71 win . In the Wildcats ' third game of the year – a win over Notre Dame in the Big Four Classic – Farmer led the team in scoring with 19 points on 7 @-@ of @-@ 11 shooting ; he added 4 assists and 2 steals against no turnovers in 23 minutes of play . 
 Prior to Kentucky 's December 15 matchup against Chattanooga , Pitino publicly contemplated starting Farmer in place of Sean Woods at point and either Carlos Toomer or Jody Thompson at shooting guard instead of Brassow . The day of the game , he announced Farmer would make the second start of his career at shooting guard alongside Woods at point . Although he tied with Pelphrey for a team @-@ high 17 points , Farmer returned to the bench for the following game against Indiana because Pitino felt he didn 't have the size to defend the Hoosiers ' bigger guards . 
 In a December 22 , 1990 , win against in @-@ state rival Western Kentucky , Farmer posted a new career high with 22 points , despite missing his first five three @-@ point attempts of the game . He would not approach such scoring numbers again until a February 3 , 1991 , contest against Georgia , when he scored 16 points after seeing extended minutes due to Woods being in foul trouble . Farmer suffered a black eye during the game , which was notable for its physicality . Messenger @-@ Inquirer sportswriter Jake Jennings also noted that Farmer relied on drives to the basket to score , as opposed to his usual penchant for shooting three @-@ point shots . 
 Before Kentucky 's February 13 game against Tennessee , Woods was hospitalized with an " acute viral illness " . Farmer started in his place , tallying 14 points and 7 rebounds in an 85 – 74 win . Although Farmer also started the next game against Ole Miss , just 48 seconds into the game his knee made contact with an opponent 's knee , sending him to the locker room and Woods into the game . Farmer returned to score a team @-@ high 21 points , but also suffered a scratched eye , in a win that gave Kentucky the best record in the SEC ; Woods logged 9 points and 7 assists in almost 24 minutes of action off the bench . Woods returned to the starting lineup in Kentucky 's next game at Vanderbilt , but Farmer remained a starter as well , replacing Jeff Brassow at shooting guard . He scored 13 of his team @-@ high 19 in the first half , but Kentucky lost the game 98 – 87 . Pitino characterized Farmer as " exhausted " in the second half , playing heavy minutes in relief of Woods , who managed only 15 minutes before fouling out . Two games later , Farmer hit four of his first five shots – including three 3 @-@ pointers – and finished with a team @-@ high 16 in a win against Alabama . Farmer notched 20 points – one behind team leader Jamal Mashburn – in Kentucky 's final game of the season , a 114 – 93 win over Auburn . The win pushed Kentucky to a conference @-@ best 14 – 4 record , but an SEC rule forbade declaring a team the regular season champion if they were ineligible for postseason play , as Kentucky was . 
 Farmer was one of five players to average double @-@ digit points per game ( 10 @.@ 1 ) ; it was the first time since Kentucky 's 1977 – 78 championship team that so many players had averaged double @-@ digit scoring . At the team 's postseason awards banquet , Farmer received the Free Throw Award for the third straight year and was also named the team 's Most Improved Player . Pitino named the four rising seniors – Farmer , Pelphrey , Woods , and Feldhaus – co @-@ captains for the upcoming season . 
 = = = Senior = = = 
 Shortly after the team 's first practice in October 1991 , Pitino again commented on Farmer 's improved conditioning , calling it his " biggest surprise " of the early practices . He also announced that seniors Sean Woods and John Pelphrey would join Jamal Mashburn in the starting lineup – as the team 's point guard , small forward , and power forward , respectively – while senior Deron Feldhaus would reprise his " sixth man " role from the previous season . Farmer was projected to compete with junior college transfer Dale Brown for the starting shooting guard spot . At the team 's annual Midnight Madness scrimmage , Farmer joined the announced starters and sophomore Gimel Martinez on the Blue team , which defeated the White team 67 – 54 . Farmer had 18 points , including 4 of 6 made three @-@ point baskets . Forbidden from holding off @-@ campus scrimmages by new NCAA regulations , Kentucky played its only public preseason scrimmage in Memorial Coliseum ; Farmer joined the White team , scoring 21 points on 6 @-@ of @-@ 12 shooting in a losing effort . 
 Suffering from the flu , Farmer did not play in the Wildcats ' season @-@ opening win against West Virginia in the Preseason NIT . He played in the following game , but missed all seven of his shots as Kentucky was eliminated from the tournament by Pitt 85 – 67 , the team 's worst home loss since 1988 . Farmer came off the bench in the Wildcats ' next game – a 90 – 69 win over UMass – but matched his career @-@ high with 22 points , including a perfect 10 @-@ of @-@ 10 from the free throw line ; he saw extended minutes in the game due to a season @-@ ending knee injury to Jeff Brassow . UMass coach John Calipari called Farmer " the difference in the game " . 
 During the non @-@ conference season , Farmer made notable plays late in important games , including a game @-@ clinching rebound against Indiana and a key three @-@ pointer in the waning minutes of a game against Ohio . In a January 2 , 1992 , game against Notre Dame , Farmer entered the game after just three minutes when starter Dale Brown sprained his ankle . In the first half , he equaled his career high of 22 points – including five three @-@ point baskets – en route to a new career @-@ high of 28 in a 91 – 70 victory . This performance notwithstanding , complaints from the fan base about Farmer 's lack of playing time – he averaged 17 @.@ 7 minutes per game through early February – grew louder and eventually became the subject of media interest . In January , two of Kentucky 's smaller newspapers printed articles on the subject – one speculating that Pitino was intentionally holding Farmer back so Farmer 's popularity wouldn 't eclipse his own . Kentucky beat writer Jerry Tipton addressed the topic at length in a Lexington Herald @-@ Leader column on February 8 , drawing a rebuke from Pitino , who called the issue a " non @-@ story " . 
 In late January , shortly before the Tipton article appeared , Pitino decided to start Farmer against Ole Miss . He believed starting Woods and bringing Brown off the bench would allow him to have one of his two best defenders on the floor more often ; he also believed Farmer 's height would not be a liability against Ole Miss ' smaller starting guards . Farmer scored 10 points on 4 @-@ of @-@ 10 shooting and led the team with 6 rebounds in a 96 – 78 victory . Pitino then decided to start Farmer and fellow reserve Deron Feldhaus in Kentucky 's next game against LSU , hoping to draw Tigers center Shaquille O 'Neal farther from the basket by starting better shooters . The strategy was not successful – Farmer shot 2 @-@ of @-@ 9 and Feldhaus 1 @-@ of @-@ 10 in a 74 – 53 loss – but Pitino announced that Farmer would continue to start because he was exhibiting more shooting confidence than Kentucky 's other guards . Farmer responded with 16 points , including four 3 @-@ pointers , in a 85 – 67 victory over Auburn . He continued to start for the Wildcats for the rest of the regular season , culminating in a Senior day win against Tennessee , when he scored 11 of Kentucky 's first 16 points and saw extended minutes after fellow senior Sean Woods was ejected for fighting with the Volunteers ' Jay Price . 
 With the team 's probation over , Farmer and the other three seniors played in their first – and only – postseason games in the 1991 – 92 season . After an opening round win against Vanderbilt in the SEC Tournament in Birmingham , Alabama , Kentucky won its third meeting of the season with LSU 80 – 74 in the second round ; the Tigers were without star center Shaquille O 'Neal , who was suspended for fighting with Tennessee 's Carlus Groves in his team 's opening round victory . In the finals , Kentucky faced three @-@ time defending tournament champion Alabama , which was without forward Andre Perry , who suffered a broken foot in the semifinals against Arkansas . Star sophomore Jamal Mashburn led all scorers with 28 points on 12 @-@ of @-@ 14 shooting , en route to an 80 – 54 victory and tournament Most Valuable Player honors . Mashburn , who shot 26 @-@ for @-@ 31 in the Wildcats ' three tournament games , said of his performance , " At the beginning of the season , I told the four seniors ' this is the only thing I can give you . I can 't give you any presents , but I can give you an SEC championship . We gave them a present they really deserved . " 
 Kentucky was seeded second in the East Region of the 1992 NCAA <unk> . The Wildcats held a narrow 62 – 59 lead with 8 : 25 to play in their first round matchup against Colonial Athletic Association champion Old Dominion when Farmer hit a layup that keyed a decisive four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ minute , 15 – 2 run , helping Kentucky to a 88 – 69 victory . Kentucky 's next game , against Iowa State , was decided at the free throw line . Kentucky was called for 29 fouls in the game , and Iowa State hit 34 @-@ of @-@ 38 free throws , but in the final 1 : 27 of the game , Kentucky shot 14 free throws – making 11 – to win the game 106 – 98 . Farmer , who finished with 14 points , hit four consecutive free throws in the final minute of the game . After the game , Pitino commented , " If not for Richie Farmer , we don 't win the game . " In the regional semifinals , the Wildcats faced a rematch with third @-@ seeded UMass . After the Minutemen cut a 20 @-@ point Kentucky lead to 2 with almost six minutes remaining in the game , UMass coach John Calipari was whistled for a technical foul for leaving the coach 's box while arguing that one of his players had been fouled on a loose ball rebound ; Farmer , who finished with 7 points , made the resulting free throws , starting an 11 – 2 run that helped Kentucky to an 87 – 77 win . 
 In the regional finals , Kentucky trailed top @-@ seeded Duke by 12 in the second half , but battled back to force overtime . With 2 @.@ 1 seconds left in overtime , Sean Woods hit a running bank shot to put Kentucky up one . Then , Duke 's Christian Laettner caught a long inbounds pass , faked right , and hit a shot at the buzzer to give Duke the 104 – 103 victory . The game , which ended Farmer 's playing career , is widely regarded as one of the greatest college basketball games of all time . Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski later recalled , " The thing I 'll always remember about that game is Richie Farmer 's face as the ball went in . That , to me , helped me to have a better understanding of that game . ... To me , that was the deepest emotion that was on the court , the emotion that was on Richie Farmer 's face . " Describing the impact of the game , Jerry Tipton wrote , " On one fateful night , the Cats obliterated any lingering association with $ 1 @,@ 000 packages and academic fraud . Alluring images of courage , honest effort and <unk> excitement became symbols of UK basketball . " Local media gave the seniors the nickname " The Unforgettables " . Collectively , they were voted as the Lexington Herald @-@ Leader 's 1992 Sportsmen of the Year . 
 At the team 's annual awards night , Farmer won the award for fewest turnovers per minute played ( 32 in 705 minutes ) , but the free throw award – won by Farmer the previous three years – went to Gimel Martinez . Athletics director C. M. Newton surprised the four seniors by hanging their jerseys in the rafters at Rupp Arena . In so doing , he violated the standards for the honor set by former athletics director Cliff Hagan . Those guidelines held that honorees must have completed a degree from the university and be at least 10 years removed from the end of their athletic eligibility . Newton cited the seniors ' " unusual and outstanding contributions " to the program as reasons to make an exception to the standards , adding , " I won 't say there never will be another exception , but the likelihood of another is not great . " Sportscaster Cris Collinsworth protested Newton 's action because it honored the seniors before other program standouts like Kyle Macy and Rick Robey . 
 After the season , the four seniors participated in a 21 @-@ city barnstorming tour of the state , playing against a group of local players in each city . At the game in Farmer 's hometown of Manchester , Farmer scored 107 points for the seniors ' team before switching to the Clay County team for the remainder of the game , hitting an additional three @-@ pointer for a total of 30 . Pelphrey hit a three to give the seniors – without Farmer – a 179 – 176 lead with 25 seconds left in the game , and the three seniors triple @-@ teamed Farmer to prevent him from getting a shot off to tie the game . Twenty percent of the proceeds from each game benefited local charities , and another twenty percent of the total proceeds from the tour was divided between the University of Kentucky Library Fund , Big Brothers Big Sisters , and AIDS Volunteers of Lexington .

 In August 1992 , <unk> Publishing of Lexington released Farmer 's autobiography entitled Richie . In addition to the standard printing , the publisher offered a special edition of the book in which direct quotes from Farmer were rendered in blue type , similar to the words of Jesus in red letter editions of the Bible . Long @-@ time Wildcats radio broadcaster Cawood Ledford wrote the book 's foreword . By the end of October , the book had sold 30 @,@ 000 copies , and a second printing from the publisher was ordered . Farmer participated in several book signings across the state , as well as filming television advertisements for local products and conducting speaking engagements for dental insurance provider Delta Dental to promote good oral health in his native eastern Kentucky . 
 Farmer continued taking classes at Kentucky with support from the Cawood Ledford Scholarship fund – designated to help University of Kentucky athletes who have exhausted their athletic eligibility finish their degrees – and in 1995 , earned a bachelor of science degree with a double major in agricultural economics and agribusiness management . After graduation , he briefly worked in sports marketing in Lexington before returning to Manchester to join his father in the insurance business . In addition to selling insurance , Farmer also got his securities license to sell annuities , and eventually rose to become vice @-@ president of Kentucky Financial Group . 
 On April 15 , 1998 , Farmer married Rebecca Ann Morgan . The couple had three sons – Richard III ( " Trey " ) and Ryan , born on November 30 in 1996 and 1998 , respectively , and Tate , born in 2001 . 
 Farmer was inducted into the KHSAA Hall of Fame in 1998 and the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame in 2002 . He was one of 88 inaugural members of the University of Kentucky Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005 and one of 16 inaugural members of the Kentucky High School Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012 . " The Unforgettables " were honored on a limited edition collector 's bottle of Maker 's Mark bourbon in 2007 .

 On January 28 , 2003 , Farmer announced he would seek the Republican nomination for Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner . In his announcement , he acknowledged that he had never operated a farm , but noted that he knew many farmers and held a degree in an agriculture @-@ related field . Ellen Williams , chair of the state 's Republican Party , said Farmer 's candidacy would bring " star quality " to a down @-@ ballot race ( i.e. state offices other than governor and lieutenant governor ) . No Republican had been elected to any of those offices since 1967 . 
 Farmer waited until three weeks before the primary election to begin seriously campaigning and focused on population centers such as Lexington , Louisville , Bowling Green , and the Northern Kentucky area , where Republican voters were more concentrated . At that time , campaign finance reports showed that Farmer had spent about half of the $ 36 @,@ 055 raised for his campaign , while his opponent , Leonard " Buck " Beasley , had raised only $ 450 and spent nothing . While he proposed no major changes to the operation of the agriculture department , Farmer emphasized teamwork as a means to improve the state 's agricultural sector , cited the need to find new markets for Kentucky agricultural products , and expressed a desire to improve the public perception of the agriculture industry , saying " Farmers have a great story to tell , and I will use any name recognition I have gained through my experience with UK basketball to help them tell it . " He also raised the possibility of engaging other former basketball players to promote the work of the agriculture department and indicated that he would lobby to have half of Kentucky 's allocation of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement directed to the state 's Agriculture Development Board . 
 With 109 @,@ 742 votes – 79 percent of the total cast – Farmer garnered more votes than any other Republican candidate for any office on the ballot en route to winning the nomination . The victory set up a general election contest against Democratic nominee Alice Woods Baesler , a state agriculture department aide and wife of former Congressman and Kentucky basketball player Scotty Baesler . Bolstered by his significantly higher name recognition , Farmer led an early July SurveyUSA poll 61 % to 33 % over Baesler . Baesler charged that Farmer was unqualified for the job of agriculture commissioner and that his high poll numbers and convincing primary victory were driven by his popularity as a basketball player , criticizing him for featuring his status as a member of " The Unforgettables " in his campaign literature . Farmer responded that his college degree qualified him to be agriculture commissioner and said his need to continue his day job to support his family often kept him away from the campaign trail where he could expound more on his ideas for running the Department of Agriculture . 
 At an August debate in Owensboro , Farmer proposed the cross @-@ promotion of Kentucky agricultural products and the state park system , awarding points for buying Kentucky produced groceries that could be redeemed for souvenirs and perks during stays at state parks . On October 21 , The Kentucky Post gave Baesler its endorsement , contrasting her experience running a farm and her involvement with the agriculture department to Farmer 's lack of agriculture experience and frequent absence at campaign events . Later that week , the Lexington Herald @-@ Leader also endorsed Baesler , and followed up the next day with an article noting that , as of October 3 , nearly one @-@ third of the $ 87 @,@ 825 @.@ 20 Farmer had spent during the campaign went to relatives – including his parents , brother , sister , and in @-@ laws – for salaries and campaign @-@ related reimbursements . Interviewed by phone , Farmer responded , " [ My family has ] probably worked 60 , 70 , 80 hours a week campaigning for me trying to get me elected . I don 't think we have done anything wrong . " Richard <unk> , chairman of campaign finance watchdog Common Cause of Kentucky , said Farmer 's actions were not illegal but were " rather odd " . Farmer overcame the bad press , however , to take the election by a vote of 575 @,@ 049 to 466 @,@ 321 . 
 In April 2004 , Farmer announced the formation of a committee to study the effectiveness of state owned and operated farmer 's markets . In June 2005 , he was elected secretary of the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture ; in 2007 , he was elected president of the organization . Farmer also sought to prevent an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis virus in the state 's horses and cattle by banning the import of animals from 20 western counties where the virus was known to have infected animals . On Farmer 's advice , Governor Ernie Fletcher requested that the United States Department of Agriculture designate Kentucky as an agricultural disaster area after an April 2007 cold snap devastated the state 's fruit and wheat crops ; the designation made Kentucky farmers eligible for low @-@ interest federal loans to help compensate for their lost crop revenue . 
 In December 2004 , Kentucky 's Registry of Election Finance , the agency that enforces the state 's campaign finance laws , hired Farmer 's sister , Rhonda F. Gray , who had previously served as chair of her brother 's campaign for agriculture commissioner . Registry chair John Rogers maintained that Gray was hired on her own merits , and Gray promised to recuse herself from any work that might involve her brother 's future campaigns . The following May , The Kentucky Post published excerpts from an email from Dick Murgatroyd , Fletcher 's deputy chief of staff , to Transportation Cabinet officials asking them to find a job for Farmer 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Jamie Gray ; the email indicated that Murgatroyd was responsible for finding jobs for both James and Rhonda Gray . Gray was later hired as an administrative specialist in the Transportation Cabinet . Farmer denied any involvement in the hiring decisions beyond submitting recommendations for both candidates . In July , Murgatroyd was indicted on 19 counts of violating the state 's merit system by making politically motivated hires , including that of Jamie Gray . A transportation official testified in September that Farmer had declined one job for Gray because the salary was too low and had negotiated a higher salary on the job Gray eventually got . Farmer called the claims " ludicrous " and " simply not true " .

 Following the resignation of Lieutenant Governor Steve Pence in June 2006 , Farmer was mentioned as a possible running mate for Fletcher in his upcoming re @-@ election campaign , but Fletcher chose Robbie Rudolph instead , and Farmer announced his intent to seek re @-@ election as agriculture commissioner . In the Republican primary , Farmer faced Don Stosberg , a former budget analyst for Kentucky 's Legislative Research Commission . Again , Farmer was criticized for failing to appear at several campaign events ; Stosberg told the Lexington Herald @-@ Leader , " [ Farmer is ] famous for three things : shooting three @-@ point shots , not returning phone calls and not showing up . " Farmer responded that he was carrying out the duties of his office during his absences from the events . Farmer countered his absences by outspending his opponent 35 @-@ to @-@ 1 , investing a reported $ 102 @,@ 000 in his campaign . Farmer captured 85 % of the vote , defeating Stosberg by a vote of 155 @,@ 576 to 26 @,@ 897 . Name recognition played a role in both parties ' primaries : Farmer enjoyed high name recognition from his days as a basketball player , while the Democratic nominee , David Lynn Williams , had a name similar to that of Kentucky Senate President David L. Williams . 
 Shortly after the primary election , Williams made a series of politically <unk> remarks in an interview published by a weekly online magazine devoted to Kentucky agricultural issues ; among the gaffes were calling the state agricultural development board and long @-@ time Kentucky Democratic Senator Wendell H. Ford " a bunch of damn liars " . State Democratic chairman Jonathan Miller called Williams ' statements " offensive " and said that several of the party 's executive committee members desired to have Williams removed as the party 's candidate . In June , Williams was arrested on misdemeanor charges of menacing , disorderly conduct , and harassment for allegedly threatening his niece , the city clerk of Glasgow , Kentucky , because she did not produce records he had requested under Kentucky 's open records law . His trial was not scheduled until after the election . 
 By October , a Research 2000 poll showed Farmer leading the race 54 % – 35 % , with 11 % undecided , and campaign finance documents showed that Farmer had spent $ 57 @,@ 075 of the $ 168 @,@ 650 he raised for his general election campaign , while Williams had raised and spent less than $ 1 @,@ 000 . The Lexington Herald @-@ Leader made no endorsement in the race , stating that Farmer 's lack of knowledge was obvious during his first term , but that he " looks like a farm @-@ policy genius " compared to Williams . On election day , Farmer set a record for the most votes received in an election for a constitutional office in Kentucky , garnering 641 @,@ 789 ( 64 % ) to Williams ' 363 @,@ 188 ( 36 % ) . During his victory speech , Farmer denied rumors that he was considering switching his affiliation to the Democratic Party . 
 Farmer asked U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack for declarations of agricultural disasters in the wake of an ice storm in January 2009 that endangered the state 's livestock and flooding that affected Kentucky Lake in 2010 , damaging large portions of the state 's corn , soybean , and wheat crops . In December 2010 , he launched a joint investigation with Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway into claims that the Eastern Livestock company had not paid Kentucky cattlemen for $ 130 million in livestock .

 Farmer was limited to two terms by the Kentucky Constitution , and in October 2009 , the Lexington Herald @-@ Leader reported that he was " in discussions " about running for governor in the 2011 election . In August 2010 , Farmer announced that he would be " running for something " in the upcoming election and would announce his plans within weeks after the Kentucky State Fair . The Lexington Herald @-@ Leader speculated that Farmer could run for governor , secretary of state , or lieutenant governor on a ticket with Senate President David Williams . On September 1 , 2010 , Williams and Farmer announced that they would run as a ticket for governor and lieutenant governor , respectively . 
 Shortly after the announcement , Farmer began to face criticism for his use of state funds during difficult economic times that resulted in austerity measures in most state government agencies . One such criticism involved the attendance of Farmer and three aides at the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture 's 2010 annual meeting in St. Croix at a cost of $ 10 @,@ 000 . Another involved the approval of merit raises for eleven agriculture department employees in 2010 when workers in all other state government agencies received no cost of living salary increases and were required to take six unpaid furlough days . A department spokesman said the employees had taken on responsibilities for multiple jobs left unfilled by attrition . " The thought process was that this was more cost @-@ effective than hiring new people , " the spokesman said . Every constitutional officer in the state also donated a day 's salary to the state treasury or to a charity on each of the mandatory furlough days , but Farmer refused , saying he opposed the entire concept of furlough days for government workers . After significant public criticism , Farmer apologized and decided to donate six days ' worth of his salary to charity . 
 Farmer was also criticized for his management of the agriculture department 's vehicle fleet . Late in his first term , Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet , opting to have department officials manage them separately . In 2010 , the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions , a free market think tank , criticized the department 's management of the vehicles under its control , citing the frequency with which the department 's vehicles were being replaced . The Lexington Herald @-@ Leader noted in 2010 that the department 's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state 's fleet had shrunk by 5 % , and that all but three of the department 's vehicles were fewer than four years old . A department spokesman defended the moves , citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced . The Lexington Herald @-@ Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer 's traditional Republican message of the need for less government spending . 
 Farmer 's wife Rebecca filed for divorce on April 5 , 2011 , claiming in court documents that she had no access to the family 's finances except the salary she earned as a teacher 's aide . On April 12 , Farmer petitioned the court to dismiss his wife 's divorce petition , contesting the idea that their marriage was irretrievably broken . The divorce proceedings were put on hold by mutual consent on May 26 , 2011 , but in a July 12 hearing , Farmer 's wife asked that the judge schedule a trial date ; the judge ordered mediation within 30 days instead . The mediation failed , and a trial date was set for November 22 , shortly after the gubernatorial election . A second round of mediation shortly before the scheduled hearing resulted in a settlement between the parties ; terms of the settlement were kept private . 
 In the Republican gubernatorial primary , the Williams @-@ Farmer ticket defeated businessman Phil Moffett and former Jefferson County Judge / Executive Bobbie Holsclaw . Williams and Farmer had led in opinion polling throughout the entire campaign , and neither opposing slate was able to raise enough money to engage in statewide television advertising ; despite this , Williams and Farmer received only 68 @,@ 502 votes , 48 @.@ 2 % of those cast . Holsclaw won the voting in her home county of Jefferson , which contains the city of Louisville and is the state 's most populous . Moffett , a Tea Party favorite , carried the second most populous county , Fayette ( which contains Lexington ) , as well as heavily @-@ populated Daviess , McCracken , and Warren counties , and several counties in Northern and Central Kentucky . 
 Questions about Farmer 's use of taxpayer funds continued to dog him throughout the general election campaign . Democrats demanded that Farmer reimburse the state for hotel expenses charged to the state while Farmer was conducting outreach activities at the KHSAA state basketball tournament and the Kentucky State Fair , both located fewer than 60 miles ( 97 km ) from his home . In May , the office of Democratic State Auditor <unk> Luallen notified the Internal Revenue Service that Farmer had failed to report personal use of his state vehicle as income . A spokesman for Farmer 's office said that the personal mileage had been tracked , but a department employee had failed to forward it to the state Personnel Cabinet for reporting ; he added that Farmer would file amended tax documents and have deductions taken from his wages to settle the tax liability . The state Democratic Party filed an ethics complaint against Farmer in September based on an anonymous email sent to the Personnel Cabinet claiming that , after work hours , Farmer directed an agriculture department employee to purchase a small refrigerator with state funds and deliver it to Farmer 's house . A department spokesman said Farmer spent a substantial amount of time working from a home office in 2010 due to a back injury and that the refrigerator had been moved to department offices in 2011 . 
 Beshear and Abramson easily defeated Farmer and Williams , carrying 90 of Kentucky 's 120 counties . Days later , the Lexington Herald @-@ Leader reported that Farmer had placed his girlfriend in a non @-@ merit agriculture department job on October 31 , 2011 . Williams confirmed that the woman was Farmer 's girlfriend , but denied knowledge that she had been put on the state payroll . Farmer defended the hiring , saying his girlfriend was qualified for the job , which involved administrative and clerical tasks , and that his legal team had assured him that he had followed all appropriate hiring regulations . Farmer 's successor , Republican James Comer , fired Farmer 's girlfriend a day after being sworn into office .

 = = = Investigations = = = 
 Five days after Farmer left office , Comer announced that he had requested a full audit of the department by newly elected Democratic State Auditor Adam Edelen . Among the items Comer asked Edelen to investigate were 171 items of missing agriculture department property valued at about $ 334 @,@ 000 and another 103 items worth about $ 146 @,@ 000 that were supposed to be returned to the state as surplus but could not be accounted for . A week later , Farmer returned some of the missing items . 
 Comer and Edelen released the report on their joint probe on April 30 , 2012 . It detailed a " toxic culture of entitlement " in the agriculture department under Farmer , charging that he had required state employees to conduct personal errands while on the clock , failed to report gifts in excess of $ 200 as required by state ethics laws , and signed timesheets authorizing payment to friends in the department – including his girlfriend – who had performed very little if any work . Edelen confirmed that his investigation indicated that laws had been broken , and the report was turned over to the state attorney general for investigation . Minutes after the report was released , Farmer 's lawyer made a public statement in which he opined , " I don 't see anything in this audit report that any law @-@ enforcement agency is going to be excited about . " He conceded that Farmer had declined to be interviewed during the investigation but felt it was unfair that Farmer was not given a chance to review or comment on the final report prior to its release . 
 A week after the audit results were released , Kentucky 's Executive Branch Ethics Commission reported that Farmer was the only constitutional officer who had failed to file a required disclosure of his 2011 finances by the required April 16 deadline . Farmer 's attorney said the omission was " simply a matter of oversight on Richie 's part given with [ sic ] what all has been going on . " Days later , First National Bank of Manchester filed a foreclosure suit against Farmer , alleging that no payments had been made on his $ 300 @,@ 000 home mortgage since January 2012 . Under terms of his pending divorce , Farmer was solely responsible for the mortgage on the house . The divorce was finalized in July , and on September 24 , 2012 , the house was sold at auction after Farmer was not successful in selling it himself . Earlier that week , a judge denied Farmer 's request to reduce his child support payments , which were based on his salary as agriculture commissioner . Farmer , who had not been employed since leaving office in January 2012 , told the court that the investigation into his tenure as agriculture commissioner had made it difficult to find employment . The judge found that Farmer was " voluntarily underemployed " , although he suspended the child support payments for the months of September and October 2012 in light of Farmer 's recovery from an August 30 hip replacement surgery . On November 9 , 2012 , the Lexington Herald @-@ Leader reported that Farmer had found employment at a car dealership in Manchester . 
 = = = Charges filed = = = 
 On March 18 , 2013 , the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission charged Farmer with 42 state ethics violations , the most ever registered against a single individual ; the previous high was 16 . Most of the charges against him stemmed from the previous year 's auditor 's report , but previously unreported charges included conspiring with his sister Rhonda , who was also charged , to falsify records submitted to Rhonda 's employer , the Registry of Election Finance . Farmer 's girlfriend was also charged for falsifying timesheets . These charges were followed by five indictments by a federal grand jury on April 19 , 2013 , alleging four counts of converting state funds and property to personal use and one count of soliciting a bribe in exchange for a state grant . U.S. Attorney Kerry B. Harvey said a federal investigation revealed that Farmer had created jobs in the department for his friends and girlfriend , who conducted personal errands for Farmer – including " building a basketball court for Farmer , placing flooring in Farmer 's attic and organizing Farmer 's personal effects " – while on the clock . He also said that Farmer had kept some of the gifts ordered in conjunction with the 2008 Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture conference for his own use and allowed his family to stay in hotel rooms reserved for agriculture department employees at the Kentucky State Fair . The indictment did not specify what bribe was sought in exchange for a grant to conduct an all @-@ terrain vehicle safety class , but the charges from the state Ethics Commission mentioned that Farmer had received three all @-@ terrain vehicles in exchange for awarding unspecified state grants . A Lexington Herald @-@ Leader report noted that the indictment only included events from 2008 forward because the statute of limitations had expired for any actions prior to 2008 . 
 Farmer pled not guilty to all five federal charges on April 25 , 2013 . He was released on his own recognizance , and his trial date was set for July 2 . U.S. Magistrate Robert Wier denied Farmer 's request to leave the country in May to celebrate his girlfriend 's 40th birthday in Cancún , Mexico . Wier also ordered the recently unemployed Farmer to seek employment , surrender his passport , and remain within the state until the trial . In response to Farmer 's lawyer 's request to delay the trial until February 2014 – a request the prosecution called " excessive " – Judge Gregory Van Tatenhove rescheduled the trial for October 22 . 
 = = = Plea bargain and sentencing = = = 
 On September 5 , 2013 , Farmer 's attorney filed a motion to allow Farmer to change his plea to guilty and announced that Farmer had reached a plea bargain to settle all federal and state charges against him . Farmer would have faced maximum penalties of $ 250 @,@ 000 and 10 years in prison for each federal charge against him . Instead , in exchange for his guilty plea , prosecutors agreed to pursue a sentence of 21 to 27 months in federal prison and $ 120 @,@ 500 in restitution of the $ 450 @,@ 000 Farmer was accused of misappropriating . Additionally , Farmer pleaded guilty to one state charge of violating campaign finance laws in exchange for a sentence of no more than one year , served concurrently with his federal sentence . Finally , Farmer acknowledged to the Executive Branch Ethics Commission 35 of the 42 violations he had been charged with , resulting in $ 65 @,@ 000 in fines , the most ever levied by the commission . Farmer 's attorney indicated that U.S. Attorney Kerry Harvey and Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway had been pursuing additional indictments against Farmer when the plea bargain was reached . Although still restricted from leaving the state , Farmer was allowed to remain free pending sentencing . 
 Van Tatenhove sentenced Farmer to 27 months in federal prison on January 14 , 2014 . He recommended that the sentence be served at the Federal Correctional Institution in Manchester , Farmer 's hometown , but the Federal Bureau of Prisons opted to assign him to the United States Penitentiary , Hazelton near Bruceton Mills , West Virginia . The Lexington Herald @-@ Leader noted that Farmer 's inmate number , <unk> @-@ 032 , was reminiscent of his college jersey number , 32 . 
 Originally scheduled to report to prison on March 18 , Farmer was granted a one @-@ week delay by Van Tatenhove to watch his son , Trey , play for Clay County High School in the KHSAA basketball tournament . Clay County lost that game to Covington Catholic High School 80 @-@ 78 in the first round of the tournament . Covington Catholic went on to win the KHSAA State Championship . Van Tatenhove insisted that he granted the delay in deference to the Farmer family , not as a special favor for Farmer himself . On March 25 , 2014 , Farmer reported to the satellite camp of the Hazelton prison to begin serving his sentence . He was imprisoned for almost 20 months , transitioned to a halfway house in Lexington on December 18 , 2015 , and was released on January 21 , 2016 . 
 In May 2016 , Farmer filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy . His petition stated that he was unemployed and owed $ 385 @,@ 745 in debts – including $ 120 @,@ 000 in restitution to the state and $ 15 @,@ 000 in child support that are ineligible for bankruptcy forgiveness – against $ 24 @,@ 259 in assets . He was reportedly renting a home in Clay County from his parents and driving a car they owned .

 The lesser kudu ( Tragelaphus imberbis ) is a forest antelope found in East Africa . It is placed in the genus Tragelaphus and family Bovidae . It was first described by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1869 . The head @-@ and @-@ body length is typically 110 – 140 cm ( 43 – 55 in ) . Males reach about 95 – 105 cm ( 37 – 41 in ) at the shoulder , while females reach 90 – 100 cm ( 35 – 39 in ) . Males typically weigh 92 – 108 kg ( 203 – 238 lb ) and females 56 – 70 kg ( 123 – 154 lb ) . The females and juveniles have a reddish @-@ brown coat , while the males become yellowish grey or darker after the age of two years . Horns are present only on males . The spiral horns are 50 – 70 cm ( 20 – 28 in ) long , and have two to two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half twists . 
 A pure browser , the lesser kudu feeds on foliage from bushes and trees , shoots , twigs , and herbs . Despite seasonal and local variations , foliage from trees and shrubs constitute 60 – 80 % of the diet throughout the year . The lesser kudu is mainly active at night and during the dawn , and seeks shelter in dense thickets just after the sunrise . The lesser kudu exhibits no territorial behaviour , and fights are rare . While females are gregarious , adult males prefer being solitary . No fixed breeding season is seen ; births may occur at any time of the year . The lesser kudu inhabits dry , flat , and heavily forested regions . 
 The lesser kudu is native to Ethiopia , Kenya , Somalia , South Sudan , Tanzania , and Uganda , but it is extinct in Djibouti . The total population of the lesser kudu has been estimated to be nearly 118 @,@ 000 , with a decreasing trend in populations . One @-@ third of the populations survive in protected areas . Presently , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) rates the lesser kudu as " Near Threatened " . 
 = = Taxonomy and genetics = = 
 The scientific name of the lesser kudu is Tragelaphus imberbis . The animal is classified under the genus Tragelaphus in family Bovidae . It was first described by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1869 . The generic name , Tragelaphus , derives from Greek word tragos , meaning a male goat , and <unk> , which means a deer , while the specific name imberbis comes from the Latin term meaning <unk> , referring to this kudu 's lack of mane . The vernacular name kudu ( or <unk> ) could have originated either from the Afrikaans <unk> or the Khoikhoi kudu . The term " lesser " denotes the smaller size of this antelope as compared to the greater kudu . 
 In 1912 , the genus Ammelaphus was established for just the lesser kudu by American zoologist Edmund Heller , the type species being A. strepsiceros . However , today the lesser kudu is placed in Tragelaphus instead of Ammelaphus . 
 In 2005 , Sandi Willows @-@ Munro ( of the University of KwaZulu @-@ Natal ) and colleagues carried out a mitochondrial analysis of the nine Tragelaphus species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared . The results showed that the tribe Tragelaphini is monophyletic with the lesser kudu basal in the phylogeny , followed by the nyala ( T. angasii ) . On the basis of mitochondrial data , studies have estimated that the lesser kudu separated from its sister clade around 13 @.@ 7 million years ago . On the other hand , the nuclear data shows that lesser kudu and nyala form a clade , and collectively separated from the sister clade 13 @.@ 8 million years ago . 
 The lesser kudu has 38 diploid chromosomes . However , unlike others in the subfamily <unk> , the X chromosome and Y chromosome are compound and each is fused with one of two identical autosomes .

 The lesser kudu is a spiral @-@ horned antelope . The head @-@ and @-@ body length is typically between 110 and 140 cm ( 43 and 55 in ) . Males reach about 95 – 105 cm ( 37 – 41 in ) at the shoulder , while females reach 90 – 100 cm ( 35 – 39 in ) . Males typically weigh 92 – 108 kg ( 203 – 238 lb ) and females 56 – 70 kg ( 123 – 154 lb ) . The bushy tail is 25 – 40 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 – 15 @.@ 7 in ) long , white underneath and with a black tip at the end . 
 Distinct signs of sexual dimorphism are seen in the antelope . The male is considerably larger than the female . The females , as well as juveniles , have a rufous coat , whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker after the age of two years . The male has a prominent black crest of hair on the neck , but this feature is not well @-@ developed in the female . One long white stripe runs along the back , with 11 – 14 white stripes branching towards the sides . The chest has a central black stripe , and there is no throat beard . A black stripe runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face . A chevron is present between the eyes . The area around the lips is white , the throat has white patches , and two white spots appear on each side of the lower jaw . The underparts are completely white , while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches . The lesser kudu is characterised by large , rounded ears . Its tracks are similar to the greater kudu 's . Females have four teats . The average lifespan is 10 years in the wild , and 15 years in captivity . 
 Horns are present only on males . The spiral horns are 50 – 70 cm ( 20 – 28 in ) long , and have two to two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half twists . The base circumference is 156 – 171 cm ( 61 – 67 in ) . The slender horns are dark brown and tipped with white . Male young begin developing horns after six to eight months , which reach full length after three years . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 The lesser kudu is mainly active at night and during the dawn , and seeks shelter in dense thickets just after the sunrise . It can camouflage so well in such dense vegetation that only its ears and tail can indicate its presence . The midday is spent in rest and rumination in shaded areas . The animal spends about 35 % of daytime foraging , 36 % standing and lying , and 29 % in roaming . As the thinnest <unk> , the lesser kudu can move through dense vegetation with ease . The lesser kudu is a shy and wary animal . When alarmed , the animal will stand motionless , confirming any danger . If it senses any approaching predator , it will give out a short sharp bark , similar to the bushbuck 's . The lesser kudu would then make multiple leaps of up to 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) height with an upraised tail . If captured by the predator , the victim gives a loud bleat . 
 The lesser kudu is gregarious in nature . No distinct leader or any hierarchy is noted in the social structure ; with no territorial behavior , fights are uncommon . While fighting , the lesser kudus interlock horns and try pushing one another . Mutual grooming is hardly observed . Unlike most tragelaphines , females can be closely associated for several years . One to three females , along with their offspring , may form a group . Juvenile males leave their mothers when aged a year @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half , and may form pairs . However , at the age of four to five years , males prefer a solitary lifestyle and avoiding one another , though four or five bulls may share the same home range . Lesser kudu do not usually associate with other animals , except when they feed in the same area . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 A pure browser , the lesser kudu feeds on foliage from bushes and trees , shoots , twigs and herbs . It also eats flowers and fruits if available , and takes small proportions of grasses , usually in the wet season . Despite seasonal and local variations , foliage from trees and shrubs constitutes 60 @-@ 80 % of the diet throughout the year . Foliage from creepers and vines ( such as <unk> <unk> and some species of Cucurbitaceae and <unk> ) forms 15 @-@ 25 % of the diet in the wet season . Fruits are consumed mainly in the dry season . Olfactory searching , much in the same posture as grazing , is used to find fallen fruits ( such as Melia <unk> and Acacia tortilis ) , while small fruits ( such as Commiphora species ) are directly plucked from trees . The size and structure of its stomach also suggests its primary dependence on browse . 
 The lesser kudu browses primarily at dusk or at dawn , and is associated with the gerenuk and the impala . The lesser kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season . However , unlike the gerenuk , the lesser kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding . The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement for water , and can browse in arid environments . It eats succulent plants , such as the wild sisal , <unk> , and Euphorbia species in the dry season , and drinks water when sources are available . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Both the males and females become sexually mature by the time they are a year @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half old . However , males actually mate after the age of four to five years . Males and females are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14 – 18 years , respectively , with the maximum age of successful lactation in females being 13 – 14 years . With no fixed breeding season ; births may occur at any time of the year . A study at <unk> Králové Zoo ( Czech Republic ) showed that 55 % of the births occurred between September and December . A rutting male tests the urine of any female he encounters , to which the female responds by urinating . Having located a female in estrus , the male follows her closely , trying to rub his cheek on her rump , head , neck , and chest . He performs gasping movements with his lips . Finally , the male mounts the female , resting his head and neck on her back , in a similar way as other tragelaphines . 
 The gestational period is of seven to eight months , after which a single calf is born . A female about to give birth isolates herself from her group , and remains alone for some days afterward . The newborn calf weighs 4 – 7 @.@ 5 kg ( 8 @.@ 8 – 16 @.@ 5 lb ) . Around 50 % of the calves die within the first six months of birth , and only 25 % can survive after three years . In a study at Basle Zoo ( Switzerland ) , where 43 % of the offspring from captive breeding died before reaching the age of six months , the major causes of high juvenile mortality were found to be the spread of white muscle disease and deficiency of vitamin E and selenium in diets . The herd size , sex , interbreeding , and season did not play any role in juvenile mortality . The mother hides her calf while she goes out to feed , and returns mainly in the evening to suckle her young . She checks the calf 's identity by sniffing its rump or neck . In the first month , suckling may occur for eight minutes . The mother and calf communicate with low bleats . She licks her offspring , particularly in the perineal region , and may consume its excreta . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The lesser kudu inhabits dry , flat , and heavily forested regions . It is closely associated with Acacia and Commiphora thornbush in semiarid areas of northeastern Africa . The animal avoids open areas and long grass , preferring shaded areas with short grasses , instead . Found in woodlands and hilly areas , as well , the lesser kudu is generally found at altitudes below 1 @,@ 200 m ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) ; though they have been recorded at heights about 1 @,@ 740 m ( 5 @,@ 710 ft ) near Mount Kilimanjaro . While individual home ranges of these animals are 0 @.@ 4 – 6 @.@ 7 km2 ( 4 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 – 72 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sq ft ) in size , those of males have an average size of 2 @.@ 2 km2 ( 24 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sq ft ) and those of females 1 @.@ 8 km2 ( 19 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . 
 The lesser kudu is native to Ethiopia , Kenya , Somalia , South Sudan , Tanzania , and Uganda , but it is extinct in Djibouti . Largely confined to the Horn of Africa today , the species historically ranged from Awash ( Ethiopia ) southward through southern and eastern Ethiopia , and most parts of Somalia ( except the north and the northeast ) and Kenya ( except the southwest ) . It also occurred in southeastern Sudan and northeastern and eastern parts of Uganda and Tanzania . The only evidence for its existence in the Arabian peninsula is a single set of horns obtained in 1967 from an individual shot in South Yemen and another in Saudi Arabia . 
 = = Threats and conservation = = 
 The lesser kudu 's shyness and its ability to camouflage itself in dense cover has protected it from the risks of poaching . For instance , the lesser kudu is widespread in the Ogaden region , which is rich in dense bush , despite reckless hunting by local people . However , rinderpest outbreaks , to which the lesser kudu is highly susceptible , have resulted in a steep decline of 60 % in the animal 's population in Tsavo National Park in Kenya . Overgrazing , human settlement , and loss of habitat are some other threats to the survival of the lesser kudu . 
 The total population of the lesser kudu has been estimated to be nearly 118 @,@ 000 , with a decreasing trend in populations . The rate of decline has increased to 20 % over two decades . Presently , the IUCN rates the lesser kudu as " Near Threatened " . Around a third of the population of the lesser kudu occurs in protected areas such as Awash , Omo and Mago National Parks ( Ethiopia ) ; Lag <unk> National Park ( Somalia ) ; Tsavo National Park ( Kenya ) ; Ruaha National Park and game reserves ( Tanzania ) , though it occurs in larger numbers outside these areas . Population density rarely exceeds 1 / km2 . , and is generally much lower . 
 = Development of Deus Ex = 
 An approximately 20 @-@ person team at Ion Storm developed Deus Ex , a cyberpunk @-@ themed action @-@ role playing video game , over the course of 34 months , culminating in a June 2000 release . Team director and producer Warren Spector began to plan the game in 1993 after releasing Ultima Underworld II with Origin Systems and attempted the game both there and at Looking Glass Technologies before going into production with Ion Storm . Official preproduction began around August 1997 , lasted for six months , and was followed by 28 months of production . Spector saw their work as expanding on the precedent set by Origin , Looking Glass , and Valve Corporation . 
 In preproduction , six people from Looking Glass 's Austin studios focused on the setting ahead of the game mechanics , and chose a story centred around prominent conspiracy theories as an expression of the " millennial madness " in The X @-@ Files and Men in Black . Spector felt that the development process 's highlights were the " high @-@ level vision " and length of preproduction , flexibility within the project , testable " proto @-@ missions " , and Unreal Engine license . Their pitfalls included the team structure , unrealistic goals , underestimating risks with artificial intelligence , their handling of proto @-@ missions , and weakened morale from Daikatana 's bad press . The game was published by Eidos Interactive and released on June 23 , 2000 for Windows 95 and later versions , whereupon it earned over 30 " best of " awards in 2001 . 
 = = Preproduction = = 
 After Warren Spector released Ultima Underworld II with Origin Systems in January 1993 , he began to plan Troubleshooter , the game that would become Deus Ex . Noting his wife 's fascination with The X @-@ Files , he connected the " real world , millennial weirdness , [ and ] conspiracy stuff " topics on his mind and decided to make a game about it that would appeal to a wider audience . In his 1994 proposal , he described the concept as " Underworld @-@ style first @-@ person action " in a real world setting with " big @-@ budget , nonstop action " starring an ex @-@ cop " security specialist " . He described the project as " high " risk for its " technological unknowns " as " probably the toughest project on his wish list " . It failed to get to production . He later left Origin for Looking Glass Technologies , but kept the idea in mind . He continued to change his character and game system plans , though the game he then called Junction Point did not reach production at Looking Glass . Spector wrote that the timing was not yet ripe because the business teams were not interested , the technology was not yet feasible , he did not have an interested team or the resources to make one , and that publishers did not want a " first @-@ person , cross @-@ genre game " . Spector , himself , was also tired of unrealistic fantasy and alien settings . When John Romero of Ion Storm approached Spector to offer him a chance to make his " dream game " without any restrictions , Spector was immediately on board . 
 Preproduction began around August 1997 and lasted about six months . The six @-@ person team came from Looking Glass 's Austin studios . Spector , the team 's director and producer , saw their work as improving upon the foundation provided by Origin , Looking Glass , and Valve Corporation by doing what those companies did not . The game 's working title was Shooter : Majestic Revelations , with a scheduled release of Christmas 1998 . The working title was meant to be ironic because they did not want the game to be solely a first @-@ person shooter . They worked on the setting ahead of the game mechanics , and decided on a conspiracy @-@ style story that referenced existing conspiracy theories such as Area 51 , CIA drug trafficking , the John F. Kennedy assassination , the Majestic 12 , and a Masonic underground bunker beneath Denver International Airport . Spector said their research helped them understand how conspiracy theorists think . They also used this time to work out the backstory for constancy . The team designed over 200 characters without associated in @-@ game roles , which was both helpful when designing missions and unhelpful as they attempted to reduce their scope . In the third quarter of 1997 , Spector wrote a " manifesto " on his ideal game and the " rules of role @-@ playing " that was later published in the February 1999 Game Developer magazine . His principles included " problems , not puzzles " , " no forced failure " , " players do ; NPCs watch " , and " areas with multiple entrance and exit points " . Reflecting , Spector felt that Deus Ex accomplished the intent of his manifesto . 
 The Shooter design document set the player as an augmented agent working against an elite cabal in the " dangerous and chaotic " 2050s . Its subtitle was " roleplaying in a world of secrets , lies , and conspiracies " . It was written to be similar in concept to Half @-@ Life , Fallout , Thief : The Dark Project , and GoldenEye 007 , and to mix elements of the films Colossus : The Forbin Project , The Manchurian Candidate , and Robocop in a world inspired by The X @-@ Files and Men in Black — examples of " the millennial madness that 's gripping the world ... and a general fascination with conspiracy theories and the desire to play with high @-@ tech espionage toys " . 
 The preproduction team also tweaked the game systems . They chose a skill system that used nanotechnology augmentation , unique to the player character , as " special powers " instead of " die @-@ rolls " or skills that required granular management . They also built a conversation structure based on console role @-@ playing game setups , and drafted the augmentation upgrade , inventory , and skill screens . They also designed an in @-@ game text editor for taking notes , and " reward systems " for skill points , reduced weapon and tool <unk> , and augmentation upgrades . Preproduction had generated 300 pages of documentation by March 1998 . The document grew to 500 pages with " radically different " content by their April 1999 Alpha 1 deadline . Of Spector 's original design document , the marketing section was the only part left unedited . 
 = = Production = = 
 In early 1998 , after six months of preproduction , the Deus Ex project grew to a 20 @-@ person team and entered a 28 @-@ month production phase . Spector hired new staff in their Austin studio and was also assigned a Dallas @-@ based art team . The development team consisted of three programmers , six designers , seven artists , a writer , an associate producer , a tech , plus two writers and four testers as contractors . Chris Norden was the lead programmer and assistant director , Harvey Smith the lead designer , Jay Lee the lead artist , Sheldon Pacotti the lead writer , and Spector producer and director . 
 The team had many disagreements , and Spector 's original staff setup crumbled . When two experienced designers vied for the lead designer position , Spector chose both and made two design teams . He initially thought their competition would be easily managed and fruitful , but neither team felt second to the other and Spector had to merge the teams and choose a single designer . He felt that the matrix management structure under which the Dallas art team worked for the project but were not the project 's staff hurt the game 's progress . Some of the artists were not interested in Deus Ex , and Spector wrote that " the art department drifted a bit " . He said that the matrix management structure created tension and problems , and was generally against the idea due to how it worked at his previous studios Origin and Looking Glass . Though his stance won out and the project received dedicated artists , Spector lamented that the game could have been improved for not having matrix management in the first place . He wrote that he learned about the importance of team member personal investment in the game , the preemptive benefits of addressing personnel concerns as they arise , and the usefulness of a chain of command even when consensus works . 
 Spector described the team as interested in multiple genres of gaming , consisting of both <unk> who wanted to " do everything " and minimalists who wanted to do few things well . Close friends who understood the team 's intents were invited to test the game and give feedback . The wide range of input led to debates in the office and changes in the game . In his postmortem , Spector concluded that the team was " unrealistic , blinded by promises of complete creative freedom " and by " assurances " of budget , marketing , and no time restraints , which he called " seductive traps " . By mid @-@ 1998 , the game 's title had become Deus Ex , from the Latin literary device deus ex machina ( " god from the machine " ) whereby an impossible plot is resolved by an unpredictable intervention . Spector acknowledged its grammatical faults as a title and added that he liked it because of the in @-@ game struggle for power , the reference to the medium 's own plot difficulties , the reference to the game inside a computer machine , and the " self @-@ referential " acceptance of trying one 's best to resolve affairs . The game was published by Eidos Interactive and released on June 23 , 2000 for Windows 95 and later versions . They also planned third @-@ party ports for Mac OS 9 and Linux . 
 Spector felt that the development process 's highlights were the " high @-@ level vision " and length of preproduction , flexibility within the project , testable " proto @-@ missions " , and Unreal Engine license . Their pitfalls included the team structure , unrealistic goals , underestimating risks with artificial intelligence , their handling of proto @-@ missions , and weakened morale from bad press . He referred to that period of Ion Storm as " Sturm und Drang " with its degree of hype and as a target of vitriol following Daikatana 's " suck it down " trash talk marketing and what Spector saw as negative press in 1998 and 1999 . He said that his Austin team had " frequent " slumps in morale from taking the company 's coverage personally and seeing their private emails posted online . Spector wrote that " too many talented people " interested in Deus Ex did not join because they refused to work at Ion Storm . He added that the company 's notoriety did contribute to their press coverage from major outlets , more so than during his time at Origin or Looking Glass . Eventually , the Deus Ex Austin team developed a " ' we 'll show them ' mentality " to distinguish their work and reputation from the Dallas @-@ based Daikatana and Anachronox Ion Storm releases , which Spector considered toxic . 
 = = = World and character design = = = 
 The original 1997 design document for the game privileges character development over all other parts , including experimental sequences and technology demos . They wanted players to consider " who they wanted to be " in the game , and for that to be connected to how they behaved in the game . In this way , the game world was " deeply simulated " : real and common sense enough to be believed that the player may think about solving the game problems in creative and emergent ways without seeing distinct puzzles . The developers also wanted " choice " with " consequence " — what Spector called the team 's " two most frequently uttered words " . Their simulation was not able to maintain that level of openness , and the team had to force " skill " , " action " , and " character interaction " paths through the levels . Spector compared this technique to the practices of Ultima 's developers , though he felt his team did it " more consciously and ... effectively " . Spector later credited Konami 's 1995 role @-@ playing video game Suikoden as an inspiration , stating that the limited choices in Suikoden inspired him to expand on the idea with more meaningful choices in Deux Ex . 
 The game changed greatly over the course of production , but parts that remained consistent include the augmented <unk> protagonist JC Denton . The anti @-@ terrorism organization UNATCO was originally TLC , the Terrorist Limitation Coalition . Ally Tracer Tong was more of a " mercenary " than a " kindly anarchist " , while enemies like UNATCO 's Joseph Manderley went from " ruthless bastard " to " stuffy bureaucrat " and Majestic 12 's Bob Page and assassin Anna Navarre played more of a background role . Many of the original character ideas were reshaped to fit the final game design . The Majestic 12 organization originally intended to initiate a Mexican invasion of Texas and then suffocate the presidential cabinet by killing their oxygen supply . When this failed , their artificial intelligence kills the organization and retreats to outer space with nuclear weapons . Some of the plot and characters were brought to the final version , except that Majestic 12 is clandestine and focused on controlling the Internet . Though Spector originally pictured the game as akin to The X @-@ Files , lead writer Sheldon Pacotti felt it ended up more like James Bond . Spector himself called the game " James Bond meets The X @-@ Files " . He wrote that the team overextended itself by planning such elaborate scenes , especially parts such as a replica of downtown Austin , Area 51 reconstructed from satellite data , a sunken post @-@ earthquake Los Angeles , a raid to free thousands of prisoners of war from a Federal Emergency Management Agency @-@ controlled United Nations concentration camp , and over 25 missions throughout Siberia , western Europe , and the United States . 
 Designer Harvey Smith suggested a streamlined plot that removed the Mexican invasion to make development easier and the narrative more personal . While finished assets were repurposed , entire parts of the game were abandoned , including Texas and the Denver airport . Environments such as a flooded city became a Majestic 12 research site and the endgame Helios space station became Area 51 . He also made the call to remove a playable mid @-@ game White House level due to its complexity and production needs in other areas . Pete Davison of USgamer referred to the White House and presidential bunker as " the truly deleted scenes of Deus Ex 's lost levels " . Spector referred to his " dream " level — the White House — as their " toughest map challenge " . The team has speculated that the assets may exist on a " DVDs in someone 's attic " , though Pacotti , Smith , Spector , and the final release have no trace of them . Pacotti felt that the experience of rescuing Paul was worth cutting the White House from the game . 
 Testing revealed that their idea of a role @-@ playing game based in the real world was more interesting in theory than actuality . They chose two real @-@ world inspirations for levels : " highly interconnected , multi @-@ level " spaces and places one cannot normally visit ( such as the White House ) . In practice , they felt that some functions of the real world , such as hotels and office buildings , were not compelling in a game , and that " reality " always lost when up against " fun " . Their recreations of notable locations and items such as the Statue of Liberty and payphones were questioned when they did not emulate the actual site or function . Internally , the team began to doubt their investment in a non @-@ player character @-@ driven game as sufficiently interesting . Spector was swayed by this widespread sentiment to have " monsters and bad guys " , and the team increased the prominence of several robots and added genetically @-@ altered animals that still fit the story . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 The game was designed to be " genre @-@ busting " — partly simulation , role @-@ playing game , first @-@ person shooter , and adventure . Spector intended for Deus Ex to be an " immersive simulation " similar to Ultima Underworld by removing reminders of the game world such as interface or backstory . He described the game 's role @-@ playing elements as the player @-@ character becomes a " unique alter ego " built from the ramifications of their unique gameplay decisions . Similar to a first @-@ person shooter , the game uses a first @-@ person perspective and includes shooting , but there are other non @-@ violent gameplay options . Like an adventure game , Deux Ex is primarily based on a linear narrative story and item collection , though its puzzles are open @-@ ended with many possible solutions and consequences . Ion Storm felt the game was about player expression rather than the appearance of the developers ' ingenuity , and wanted to treat the player as a " collaborator " that they could empower to make choices and deal with consequences . 
 Once implemented , the team 's game systems did not work as intended . They built prototypes of the systems and some missions towards the beginning of development , which uncovered some of their blind spots . For example , their early implementation of the conversation system and user interface afforded them enough time to revise by the final release . They also found the augmentations and skills to not be as interesting in implementation as they seemed in the design document . Developers from other companies , such as Doug Church , Rob Fermier , Marc LeBlanc , and Gabe Newell , identified these deficiencies in game " tension " when they played the prototype . This led to a substantial revision of the augmentations and skills ; Smith designed an augmentation per @-@ use " energy cost " that led to energy refill rewards and more tactical play . 
 Their milestones served as wake @-@ up calls for the game 's direction . A May 1998 " proto @-@ mission " milestone was to have a basic but functional demo of the crucial game systems and two maps ( the White House and Hong Kong ) ready . The team worked on the riskiest parts of the game first such that the core game would be functioning , albeit not polished . The demo revealed that the size of their maps caused speed problems and would have to be divided into smaller maps . It also was one of the first signs that maps needed to be cut . The team forgot to prototype the non @-@ player character artificial intelligence in this demo . A year later , in May 1999 , they reached a milestone for finished game systems and the first two missions completed . While the player could start the game and character , use augmentations , acquire inventory , complete objectives , and save the game , their poor quality and comments from Newell led Spector to nickname milestone the " Wow , these missions suck " milestone . They felt that their first demos showed their potential , but they were not nearly close to reaching it . This milestone also helped them estimate the work required for missions and the portions that worked best , which led to a trim of their 500 @-@ page design manual to the best 270 pages . Spector recalled Smith 's mantra here : " less is more " . 
 Smith had " an intimacy " with the level design tools such that he could sense when the design met the game 's technical restrictions , like the maximum possible size or number of characters for a room . He suggested the narrower skill tree with palpable effects , such as exchanging skills about weapon damage for more accessible weapons . The team adopted the cuts , having been encouraged by the recent milestone . Spector has said that had they waited for the beta to have made the same reductions ( as per common practice ) , " it would have been a disaster . " Spector 's post @-@ proto @-@ mission strategy was to bring the rest of the missions to proto @-@ mission functionality rather than perfecting the two existing proto @-@ missions . He felt that this would be a more efficient use of staff time , even if it meant that the final product would be more " bare @-@ bones " than brilliant . Almost all of their game systems besides the inventory and conversation schemes were rethought up through the end of the project . 
 They also made choices about the minutiae of game mechanics . The team chose to pause the action while the player was viewing interfaces as to keep the strategy tactical , and to make the affinity of strangers and purpose of items " instantly recognizable " . Spector said that the issue of naming the player @-@ character almost incited a " holy war " , though they compromised and let the player choose in exchange for a common " code name and backstory " . They also saved the cinematic cutscene work for last so as not to repeat work as things changed during development . 
 Spector wrote that the team did not figure out how to handle NPC AI until late in development . This led to wasted time as the team discarded their early AI . They were also building atop their game engine 's shooter @-@ based AI instead of building a customized version anew to handle the spectrum of convincing emotions they wanted from their characters . As a result , NPC behavior was variable until the very end of development . Spector felt that their " sin " was their inconsistent display of a trustable " human AI " . 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 The game was developed on systems including dual @-@ processor Pentium Pro 200s and Athlon 800s with eight and nine @-@ gigabyte hard drives , some using SCSI . The team used " more than 100 video cards " throughout development . Deus Ex was built using Visual Studio , Lightwave , and Lotus Notes . The team also built a custom dialogue editor , <unk> . They used <unk> atop the Unreal game engine for map design , which Spector wrote was " superior to anything else available " . Their trust in <unk> led them to code " special cases " for their immediate mission needs instead of more generalized multi @-@ case code . Even as team members expressed concern , the team only addressed this later in the project . To Spector , this was a lesson to always prefer " general solutions " over " special casing " , such that the tool set works predictably . 
 They waited to license a game engine until after preproduction , expecting the benefits of licensing to be more time for the content and gameplay . They chose the Unreal engine as it did 80 % of what they needed from an engine and was more economical than building from scratch . Their small programming team allowed for a larger design group . The programmers also found the engine accommodating , though it took about nine months to acclimate to the software . Spector estimated that six to nine months of playing with the engine were necessary to learn how to use it properly , and even still , their ideas did not always implement as planned . Spector thought it would have been much harder to have written the interfaces , skill systems , and conversations on their own . Despite the savings , the time Spector thought they would save not writing an engine was lost learning the engine , though they did have more time to work on content creation and gameplay systems . Spector also felt that they would have understood the code better had they built it themselves , instead of " treating the engine as a black box " and coding conservatively . He acknowledged that this precipitated into the Direct3D issues in their final release , which slipped through their quality assurance testing . Spector also noted that the artificial intelligence , pathfinding , and sound propagation were designed for shooters and should have been rewritten from scratch instead of relying on the engine . He thought the licensed engine worked well enough that he expected to use the same for the game 's sequel and Thief 3 . He added that developers should not attempt to force their technology to perform in ways it was not intended , and should find a balance between perfection and pragmatism . 
 = = Post @-@ release = = 
 Though their quality assurance did not see major Direct3D issues , players noted " dramatic slowdowns " immediately following launch , and the team did not understand the " black box " of the Unreal engine well enough to make it do exactly what they needed . Spector characterized Deus Ex reviews into two categories based on how they begin with either how " Warren Spector makes games all by himself " or that " Deus Ex couldn 't possibly have been made by Ion Storm " . He has said that the game won over 30 " best of " awards in 2001 , and concluded that their final game was not perfect , but that they were much closer for having tried to " do things right or not at all " . 
 = Bowman v. Monsanto Co . = 
 Bowman v. Monsanto Co . , 569 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2013 ) was a United States Supreme Court patent decision in which the Court unanimously affirmed the decision of the Federal Circuit that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved , patented seeds without the patent owner 's permission . The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman , an Indiana farmer , bought transgenic soybean seeds from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season . Monsanto originally sold the soybeans to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer @-@ buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting . The farmers sold their soybean crops ( also seeds ) to the local grain elevator , from which Bowman then bought them . After Bowman replanted seeds for his second harvest , Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by replanting soybeans without a license . In response , Bowman argued that Monsanto 's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent exhaustion , because all future generations of soybeans were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold . 
 In a unanimous opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan , the Supreme Court ruled that Bowman 's conduct infringed upon Monsanto 's patent rights and that the doctrine of patent exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holder 's permission . The Court held that , when a farmer plants a harvested and saved seed , thereby growing another soybean crop , that action constitutes an unauthorized " making " of the patented product . 
 The case garnered attention in part due to its potential impact on policy about genetically modified crops and self @-@ replicating technologies , and due to the involvement of Justice Clarence Thomas , who previously served as a lawyer for Monsanto . Commentators noted , however , that the Court 's ruling was narrow in scope , and did not set a broad legal precedent with respect to the applicability of the doctrine of patent exhaustion to self @-@ replicating technologies . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Factual setting = = = 
 Monsanto developed patents for genetically modified soybeans that were resistant to glyphosate @-@ based herbicides . When farmers sprayed the modified soybeans with the glyphosate herbicide Roundup , the modified soybeans would survive while competing plants ( weeds ) would be killed . Monsanto sold these soybeans under a limited @-@ use license that prohibited the farmer @-@ buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting . 
 In 1999 , Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean seeds from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season . He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years . Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator where he and neighbors sold their soybean crops , many of which were transgenic , and the elevator sold soybeans as commodities , not as seeds for planting . He tested the new seeds , and found that as he had expected , some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate . He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting , supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator . He informed Monsanto of his activities . 
 Monsanto stated that he was infringing its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto ; Bowman stated that he had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator , on the grounds that for seed , all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold . Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop , but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation . In 2007 , Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana . 
 = = = Lower court rulings = = = 
 After filing suit , Monsanto moved for summary judgment . In response , Bowman argued that if Monsanto was allowed to continue its license past exhaustion , it would be able to dominate the market . Although the district court found Bowman 's arguments compelling , it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. <unk> to control , and in 2009 , the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto . The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license , they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted . The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $ 84 @,@ 456 @.@ 30 and enjoined Bowman from making , using , selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto 's patent . 
 Bowman then appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit . Bowman argued that the Monsanto license agreement allowed the sale of second @-@ generation soybeans to both grain elevators and subsequent buyers and that this caused the patent rights to be exhausted per the United States Supreme Court 's ruling in Quanta Computer , Inc. v. LG Electronics , Inc . Monsanto argued that the license agreement specifically prohibited the use of second @-@ generation seeds for planting . The Federal Circuit upheld the lower court 's decision in favor of Monsanto . 
 = = = Petition to the Supreme Court = = = 
 Bowman sought review in the United States Supreme Court . Bowman argued that the Federal Circuit 's decision conflicted with existing Supreme Court precedent on patent exhaustion . Bowman said that United States v. <unk> Lens Co. showed that patent exhaustion applied even when the patent holder created post @-@ sale restrictions . He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created a judicial exception to patent exhaustion for Monsanto , allowing it to dominate the soybean seed market . Finally , Bowman argued that he was not " making " infringing new seeds merely by planting and reaping crops . 
 Monsanto argued that the Federal Circuit 's decision was correct because Bowman had created a new product that infringed on their patent . They further argued that this was not an appropriate case to hear , as the decision was not decided on patent exhaustion via a conditional sale . The Supreme Court requested the United States to brief the Court , and the Solicitor General filed a brief generally in support of the Monsanto position . The United States asked the Court to deny certiorari . The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 5 , 2012 .

 = = = Arguments = = = 
 Bowman was represented by Mark P. Walters of Frommer , Lawrence , & Haug , LLP . Walters argued that the authorized sale of the seeds extinguished the patent , and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo . He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created an exception to the exhaustion doctrine , and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide . Seth P. Waxman , a former Solicitor General , represented Monsanto and argued that the second @-@ generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement . He noted that even when exhaustion applied , it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product , which the second @-@ generation seeds were . 
 A number of Amici Curiae also filed briefs on behalf of the parties . For example , the American Intellectual Property Law Association , arguing on behalf of Monsanto , wrote that " [ e ] <unk> of the right to control propagation of patented seed would disrupt the balance created by Congress between the Patent Act and the Plant Variety Protection Act . " The American Seed Trade Association , also arguing on behalf of Monsanto , wrote that " [ p ] <unk> seed technology benefits farmers , consumers and the environment " . The National Farmers Union , arguing on behalf of Bowman , wrote that " [ a ] patent exhaustion exception for self @-@ replicating technologies is inconsistent with this Court ’ s precedent and the competition policies reflected in the first @-@ sale doctrine " , and the Center for Food Safety wrote that " [ f ] arming is not genetic engineering " . 
 = = = Commentary prior to the Supreme Court 's ruling = = = 
 In the months leading up to the decision , commentators weighed in on several issues relating to the case . Because Justice Clarence Thomas had served as a lawyer for the Monsanto Company 34 years earlier , some critics questioned whether he would remain impartial . Other commentators noted that the case raised the " important question " of whether the exhaustion doctrine should include an exception for self @-@ replicating technologies , which may one day include self @-@ replicating robots . In <unk> , Ronald Mann wrote the case 's " practical ramifications are substantial " , and that the case was " one of the highest @-@ stakes cases of the Term " . However , Mann also predicted that " it seems most unlikely the Court will rule against Monsanto " , and in his coverage of the case 's oral arguments , he observed that " none of the Justices expressed any sympathy for [ Bowman ’ s ] position " . 
 = = = Opinion of the Court = = = 
 On May 13 , 2013 , Justice Elena Kagan delivered the Court 's unanimous opinion , which affirmed the judgment of the Federal Circuit . Justice Kagan stated that while an authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item , that exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holder 's permission . Justice Kagan stated that when a farmer plants a harvested and saved seed , thereby growing a further soybean crop , that action constitutes an unauthorized " making " of the patented product , in violation of section 271 ( a ) of the patent code . Justice Kagan concluded that Bowman could resell the patented seeds he obtained from the elevator , or use them as feed , but that he could not produce additional seeds ( that is , crops ) . 
 = = Commentary and analysis = = 
 After the Court published its decision , analysts offered a range of opinions about the impact of the Court 's ruling . An academic co @-@ author of an amicus brief on behalf of Bowman filed by the American Antitrust Institute expressed relief that the loss was on a narrow basis rather than providing a broad affirmation of the lack of patent exhaustion for self @-@ replicating technologies . Kevin <unk> argued that an analysis under Quanta Computer leads to the conclusion that patent rights covering self @-@ replicating seeds are exhausted on the first authorized sale , including subsequent generations , and that seed companies can only exclude subsequent <unk> with carefully written license restrictions . Ronald Mann writing in <unk> noted : " The tenor of the Court came through most clearly when the Court ridiculed what it called Bowman ’ s ' blame @-@ the @-@ bean defense ' – the argument that Bowman did not make new seeds , because it was the seeds themselves that replicated . " 
 Another academic , Richard H. Stern , did not take issue with the Court 's refusal to shelter Bowman 's conduct under the exhaustion doctrine , but criticized the Court 's classification of the act of planting seeds and growing crops from them as an act of " making " a new patented article . Rochelle C. Dreyfus is also reported to have criticized the decision , noting that Bowman was attempting to obtain the benefit of the genetic modifications , while others , such as organic growers , fear being sued for inadvertent cross @-@ contamination . Additionally , the Harvard Law Review wrote that " [ t ] he Court reached the correct outcome but via the wrong route " because its ruling " obfuscates the role of the licensing agreement " and because the " exhaustion doctrine is ill suited to address the challenges posed by self @-@ replicating technologies " . 
 Other commentators suggested the case will have broad @-@ ranging impacts for other self @-@ replicating technologies . <unk> Marie Peavey suggested that the Court " appeared to be alert to the consequences of its ruling , not just for the value of Monsanto ’ s soybean patents , but also for technologies like cell lines , software , and vaccines " . Likewise , Christopher M. Holman wrote that the case " should be viewed as a bellwether for an oncoming wave of controversy around the patenting of self @-@ replicating technologies that will challenge the ability of the patent system to respond effectively " . William J. Simmons also wrote that " more cases like this will probably be appealed to [ the Supreme Court ] as these technologies become more prevalent in society " . 
 = = Subsequent developments = = 
 In a similar case , Organic Seed Growers & Trade Ass 'n v. Monsanto Co . , a coalition of farmers filed suit to challenge twenty @-@ three of Monsanto 's patents for glyphosate @-@ resistant crops . The plaintiffs argued that if their crops became " contaminated by transgenic seed , which may very well be inevitable given the proliferation of transgenic seed today , they could quite perversely also be accused of patent infringement " . The plaintiffs sued to declare Monsanto 's patents invalid and asked Monsanto to " expressly waive any claim for patent infringement [ Monsanto ] may ever have " against the farmers and to " memorialize that waiver by providing a written covenant not to sue " . However , the case was dismissed for lack of a controversy . The suit did not demonstrate instances of current harm or future risk . Monsanto also gave assurances that it did not plan to sue in cases of inadvertent infringement when a grower was not also using glyphosate on their crop . Monsanto 's patent for the soybeans at issue in this case expired in 2014 , prior to which Monsanto announced that it will no longer enforce the licenses associated with the soybeans . 
 = How Will I Know = 
 " How Will I Know " is a song recorded by American recording artist Whitney Houston for her debut album , titled Whitney Houston , which was released in February 1985 . It was released by Arista Records in November that year , as the album 's third single . Composed by George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam , the song was originally intended for Janet Jackson , but she passed on it . Houston then recorded the song with altered lyrics and production from Narada Michael Walden . The lyrics speak about the protagonist trying to discern if a boy she likes will ever like her back . 
 " How Will I Know " received mainly positive reviews . The song became Houston 's second number one single on the United States Billboard Hot 100 . It spent two weeks atop the chart and also became Houston 's first chart topper on the Canadian RPM Singles Chart . Success was worldwide : it reached the top 10 in Sweden , Ireland , Norway , and the United Kingdom , and the top 20 in the Netherlands , New Zealand , and Switzerland . 
 The song 's music video features scenes of Houston dancing in a setting of video screens and colored partitions . The music video gave Houston exposure to the teens and MTV . It also received nominations at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Female Video and Best New Artist in a Video , winning the former category . The song was performed on many of her tours including Greatest Love Tour ( 1986 ) and her Nothing but Love World Tour ( 2009 – 10 ) . " How Will I Know " is also featured as a remix on Houston 's compilation album , Whitney : The Greatest Hits ( 2000 ) , whereas the original version is featured on The Ultimate Collection ( 2007 ) and I Will Always Love You : The Best of Whitney Houston ( 2012 ; remastered ) . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 Originally , songwriters George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam had written the song 's demo for Janet Jackson , employed by A & M Records executive , John McClain . However , after hearing the song , Jackson 's management passed on the song , feeling it was too weak in comparison to her other material . In an interview with Fred Bronson , Merrill expressed his feelings after learning of Jackson 's decision . " We were pretty upset because we thought it was perfect for her at the time . We had written it with her completely in mind . " During this period , Brenda Andrews , at Almo @-@ Irving Music , Merrill and Rubicam 's publisher , played the song for Gerry Griffith , the director for R & B music at A & M and Arista Records . Griffith , who was compiling material for Houston 's debut at the time , felt the song perfectly matched her sound . He soon contacted Andrews and the song 's two writers and implored that they should relinquish the song to him for Houston 's debut album . Griffith described his discovery of the song , and what he and Clive Davis thought of it : 
 " We had a lot of R & B @-@ based tunes , we had a few ballads , but we didn 't have a pop crossover song . So when I heard ' How Will I Know , ' I said this is absolutely perfect . I played it for Clive [ and ] he fell in love with it . I wasn 't very familiar with her family background , I didn 't realize that even at that time there was a pretty big industry buzz about her future . " 
 After getting permission to use the song from Merrill , Griffith quickly turned to Narada Michael Walden , who was producing Aretha Franklin 's " I Knew You Were Waiting ( For Me ) " , for her album Who 's Zoomin ' Who ? , at the time . After getting in touch with Walden , Griffith frantically implored him to produce the song , describing how important the song would be for Houston 's future album . After hearing the song 's demo , Walden agreed to fly down to San Rafael , California to arrange it . He was not much impressed with the demo and requested permission to change some of the song 's lyrics and chord progression . <unk> by his request , Merrill and Rubicam denied him the right to their song . After a lot of back @-@ and @-@ forth with Griffith , they compromised and allowed Walden to de @-@ construct the song and change the key and tempo . After completing the song , Houston came into the studio to record her vocals . Originally , Cissy Houston , the singer 's mother , was intended to perform the song 's background vocals . Houston had wanted to introduce her mother 's vocals on the track , insisting on their inclusion . However , after hearing the finished result , Davis felt Houston 's voice itself fit the song 's arrangement , and implored her to sing the backup section on her own . While reluctant at first , Houston agreed and re @-@ recorded the background vocals to the praise of both Griffith and Davis . Griffith explained : 
 " I asked Whitney to sing the background session . She was reluctant because she wanted to enjoy hearing her mother sing . I said , ' No , get out there and sing , ' so she did . The background sounded incredible ... Clive Davis heard the mix and immediately gave it a 10 , which is outrageous for him , because he doesn 't like anything ! "

 " How Will I Know " is composed in an " 80 's dance beat . " Rolling Stone described the song as a " perky synth @-@ funk " . According to Kyle Anderson of MTV , the song found Houston hitting an " incredible groove . " It is written in the key of G flat major . The beat is set the time signature of common time and moves at a fast tempo of 120 beats per minute . The song also has the sequence of G ♭ -B ♭ m7 @-@ G ♭ / C ♭ -D ♭ -E ♭ m @-@ D ♭ as its chord progression . Houston 's vocals in the song span from the note of E ♭ 4 to the high note of G ♯ 5 . Lyrically , the song speaks about the protagonist trying to discern if a boy she likes will ever like her back . She is also hesitant , because her friends tell her " love can be deceiving " , and she is shy that she cannot phone him . Later , she feels that it might be a dream , but realizes that " there 's no mistaking " , and what she feels is really love .

 The song mainly garnered positive reviews from critics , with some noting it as a standout on the album . Don Shewey of Rolling Stone commented " Although it 's awfully reminiscent of the Pointer Sisters ' ' He 's So Shy ' , ' How Will I Know ' is still irresistibly danceable . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic wrote " ... what really impresses some 20 @-@ plus years on are the lighter tracks , particularly the breakthrough single ' How Will I Know ' . " While listing Houston 's top five songs of the 1980s , Steve Peake of About.com gave the song a positive review , writing , " Houston 's <unk> , peppy numbers tend to suffer from a particularly dated sound compared to her ballads , but this song still works remarkably well because of its lush melody throughout the verse , bridge and chorus . " " [ t ] his track helps Houston prove that she knows how to interpret , with great skill , tunes that display solid craftsmanship , " he added . While reviewing the Deluxe Anniversary Edition of the album , Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commented on the A capella version of the song noting , " a cappella mix of ' How Will I Know ' [ that ] displays the singer 's precision long before the advent of Auto @-@ Tune . " While reviewing The Ultimate Collection , Nick Levine of Digital Spy added , " Houston 's floor @-@ fillers have aged a little more gracefully , although their clunky , thudding drum sounds are as unmistakably eighties as Joan Collins ' Dynasty wardrobe . " The song was voted number twelve in VH1 's List of Greatest Songs of the 1980s .

 = Yarborough v. Alvarado = 
 Yarborough v. Alvarado , 541 U.S. 652 ( 2004 ) , is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court declined to overturn a state court 's conclusion that a minor was not in custody for Miranda purposes during his police interview . Michael Alvarado helped his friend Paul Soto steal a truck in Santa Fe Springs , California . The truck owner was killed by Soto during the robbery and Alvarado was convicted of second @-@ degree murder for his role in the crime . The evidence for Alvarado 's conviction was primarily based on statements given by Alvarado during a two @-@ hour police interrogation that occurred when Alvarado 's parents brought him to the police station . Alvarado was 17 years old and was not read his Miranda rights before questioning . During Alvarado 's murder trial in a state court , motions to suppress the statements given by Alvarado were denied on the ground that Alvarado was not in police custody at the time of the interrogation and thus did not have to be read his Miranda rights . Alvarado appealed his conviction , claiming that the determination that he was not in custody was incorrect because the courts did not take his age into account . 
 In a split decision , the Supreme Court declined to overturn the state court 's conclusion about custody because it was not objectively incorrect . The Court noted that there was no precedent that required the use of age in determining whether someone is in police custody ( this would change in 2011 with J.D.B. v. North Carolina , which held that age is relevant to determining if someone is in custody ) . The case has been cited in subsequent Supreme Court decisions as precedent for providing state courts with latitude in making decisions about general or broad rules .

 = = = Crime and investigation = = = 
 The respondent Michael Alvarado agreed to help his friend Paul Soto steal a truck in the parking lot of a shopping mall in Santa Fe Springs , California . Soto pulled out a gun and approached the driver of the truck , demanding the keys , while Alvarado hid by the driver 's side door . The driver refused and was shot and killed by Soto . Afterwords , Alvarado helped hide the gun . Los Angeles County Sheriff 's detective Cheryl Comstock led the investigation of the crime . During the investigation Comstock contacted Alvarado 's parents , saying that she wished to speak with Alvarado . Alvarado 's parents brought him to the police station to be interviewed . Comstock brought Alvarado into an interview room and questioned him for two hours . Alvarado 's parents asked to be present during the interview but were not allowed in by police . Alvarado admitted during questions that he had helped his friend try to steal the truck and that he had helped hide the gun . 
 Before custodial interrogations , police are required to give suspects a Miranda warning that informs suspects of their legal rights during interrogation . However , Alvarado was not given a Miranda warning at any time during questioning . This would form part of the basis for Alvarado 's legal defense . 
 = = = Trial and conviction = = = 
 The State of California charged Alvarado and his friend with first @-@ degree murder and attempted robbery . Alvarado attempted to suppress his statements given during the Comstock interview on the basis that he was not read his Miranda rights . The trial court denied the motion on the basis that Alvarado was not in police custody at the time he gave his statement . Alvarado was subsequently convicted , primarily based on statements Alvarado made during his police interrogation . Alvarado 's conviction was reduced by the trial judge to second @-@ degree murder for his comparatively minor role in the offense . The California Courts of Appeal affirmed the conviction and agreed that Alvarado was not in custody . The Supreme Court of California declined discretionary review . 
 Much of Alvarado 's trial focused on whether Alvarado was in custody or not during his police interview . According to Thompson v. Keohane , to determine whether someone is in custody the courts apply a reasonable person test : whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave or not . 
 = = = Petition for habeas corpus = = = 
 After his conviction , Alvarado filed for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that the custody analysis was incorrect because the court had not considered Alvarado 's age in its reasonable person test . Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ( AEDPA ) , a federal court can grant habeas corpus to a person held due to a state court judgment if the state court judgement " resulted in a decision that was contrary to , or involved an unreasonable application of , clearly established Federal law , as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States " . Alvarado 's habeas corpus petition thus depended on demonstrating that the state court 's custody determination was more than debatable , but objectively incorrect . 
 The United States District Court for the Central District of California agreed that the state court rulings were correct , however the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed . The Court of Appeals held that the state court made a mistake in not accounting for Alvarado 's youth and inexperience when evaluating custody . 
 = = Oral argument = = 
 Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted early in the oral argument that the case presented two questions . First , whether the Ninth Circuit 's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent . Second , whether the state courts ' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA . California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit 's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age as a factor in custody analysis . Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave . John P. Elwood , at the time assistant to the Solicitor General , argued that age doesn 't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect . 
 Tara K. Allen , arguing for Alvarado , claimed that the state court 's decision was objectively unreasonable because they did not consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the investigation as required by Thompson v. Keohane . Specifically , the considered circumstances of custody were not total because Alvarado 's age was not considered . Associate Justice Antonin Scalia responded by saying that , according to Thompson v. Keohane , custody is an objective test and subjective factors like characteristics of the individual do not matter . 
 = = Opinion of the Court = = 
 Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion for the Court , which declined to overturn the state court 's decision because fair @-@ minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody . Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody . Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station , the interview lasted for two hours , Alvarado was not told he was free to leave , and Alvarado 's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview . Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police , Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest , and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado 's friend , not Alvarado 's crimes . The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody , rather , the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court 's decision is objectively unreasonable . Kennedy wrote that , given this standard , the state court 's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable . 
 Central to the reversal of the Ninth Circuit was the fact that the state court did not take into account Alvarado 's age and experience with law enforcement in the custody analysis . The Court made several findings on this issue . The Court held that the use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings . <unk> with law enforcement was rejected as well ; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors . 
 = = = O 'Connor 's concurrence = = = 
 Associate Justice Sandra Day O 'Connor wrote a concurrence that agreed with the finding that the state court 's decision was reasonable . However , O 'Connor held that there could be cases in which age would be relevant to custody analysis . This would be affirmed by the Court in 2011 in J.D.B. v. North Carolina . 
 = = = Dissent = = = 
 Associate Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion , with whom Justice Stevens , Justice Souter , and Justice Ginsburg joined . Breyer disagreed with the majority 's holding that fair @-@ minded jurists could disagree on whether Alvarado was in custody , holding that the facts compelled the single conclusion that Alvarado was in custody . Breyer held that the actions the police did not do , such as arrest Alvarado or threaten him , were not as important as what the police did do . Specifically , the police had Alvarado 's parents bring him to the police station , brought Alvarado to an interrogation room , kept his parents out , and questioned him for two hours . 
 In the matter of Alvarado 's age , Breyer found that it was relevant to the custody analysis . Further , Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age in the custody analysis . Breyer called the discussion of experience with law enforcement misleading ; while experience with law enforcement can be difficult to determine , Breyer noted that Alvarado 's age was a known objective fact .

 The case received both positive and negative reception in scholarly publications .

 A note published in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported the decision on procedural grounds , noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court .

Instead , the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past .

 Berry Feld , professor at University of Minnesota Law School , wrote : " the Court 's decision ... treated juveniles as the functional equals of adults during interrogation .

 Though the Court rejected the argument that its previous holdings supported using age in the custody analysis , the Court did not rule against the use of age .

 = Ro Laren = 
 Ro Laren is a fictional character who appears on a recurring basis in the fifth , sixth and seventh series of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next Generation . Portrayed by Michelle Forbes , she is a member of the Bajoran race who joins the crew of the USS Enterprise @-@ D at the invitation of Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) . The character was intended to both be at odds with the series regulars , as well as to replace Wesley Crusher at the conn officer post on the bridge . Forbes was cast to portray Ro , after previously appearing in the series as Dara in the episode " Half a Life " . 
 The character first appears in the fifth season episode " Ensign Ro " , which reveals elements of Ro 's backstory . She continued to appear throughout that season , and made a further appearance in each of the sixth and seventh seasons . Starfleet sought her aid to help the Cardassians apprehend a Bajoran terrorist . After joining the Enterprise crew , she wants to abandon the engineering section of the vessel following a series of power failures in " Disaster " . Alongside Geordi La Forge ( LeVar Burton ) , she is affected by a Romulan experiment in " The Next Phase " and must help prevent the aliens from destroying the Enterprise . In " Rascals " , she is one of the crew who are transformed into children and helps prevent a Ferengi plot . When making her final appearance in " Preemptive Strike " , she is tasked by Starfleet to infiltrate the Maquis , eventually defecting and joining them permanently . 
 Ro was also planned to be a main character in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . However , Forbes turned down the role , so Kira Nerys was created to replace her . In the non @-@ canonical novels , Ro eventually joins the Bajoran militia and is posted onto Deep Space Nine . She re @-@ joins Starfleet when Bajor joins the Federation , and eventually becomes captain of the station . Reviewers discussed the religious views of Ro , comparing her views to those of Kira . Ro has been received positively by both critics and fans alike . Critics have praised the performances of Forbes , and the interaction of Ro with the existing characters . She has been placed in several polls listing the most popular characters , with Jordan Hoffman calling her the second strongest female character in the franchise . 
 = = Concept and development = = 
 During the course of planning out the fifth season of Star Trek : The Next Generation , the producers were looking to add a recurring character who could conflict with the regular cast at times as well as a new conn officer to replace Wesley Crusher . With that in mind , the episode " Ensign Ro " was written by Michael Piller , from a story idea created in conjunction with Rick Berman , to specifically introduce the character of Ensign Ro Laren . The episode was designed to show a backstory for the character , who would be at odds with series creator Gene Roddenberry 's ideal that Starfleet officers should all work together seamlessly . One of her major character traits was that she would be a member of an oppressed people , whose homeworld had been conquered by another . Supervising producer Jeri Taylor explained that they had sought to add some " fresh life " using a darker character . 
 Michelle Forbes was asked to return to the series , after impressing the producers with her performance as Dara in the episode " Half a Life " . The character was the daughter of Timicin , played by David Ogden Stiers , and supported the tradition that her father should commit ritual suicide upon reaching a certain age . The Bajoran make @-@ up was created on her , with Michael Westmore seeking to make her look different from the rest of the crew but in a way that would not detract from her appearance . Westmore created an appliance over Forbes ' nose , before adding a row of ridges while it was on her face . It was designed to be as thin and weightless as possible , as he wanted the piece to move with Forbes ' facial expressions . Her version of the make @-@ up had seven ridges , while other actors in " Ensign Ro " had different numbers , between five and nine , with the male actors wearing larger pieces . 
 Piller described the addition of Ro to the cast as one of that season 's biggest accomplishments , and was pleased that it was well received . He added that in " Ensign Ro " , they made a deliberate decision to have Ro embraced by Guinan in order to ensure that the fans warmed to the new addition . Piller felt that when Guinan took Ro to meet Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard in that episode , the character was effectively presenting Ro to the fans of the series and endorsing her . During the writing process , he felt that once he came across the friendship between Guinan and Ro that he believed " we had really done something magnificent " . Forbes , meanwhile , praised the writing and the cast of the series , saying that she had " become very attached to Star Trek " . 
 Piller was disappointed with the following Ro episode , " Disaster " , as it put her in the position of disbelieving Councillor Deanna Troi without having had the weight of " victories " in the past to convince the viewer of the power of her convictions . But he enjoyed her sudden relationship with Commander William Riker in " Conundrum " . Forbes shared the view of that episode , later saying " When you have amnesia , you wonder if that brings out a side of you that 's always wanted to come out . Would you really be comfortable with that ? It 's an interesting thing . I had a really good time with that episode . " Later in the season , " The Next Phase " was written with the idea of being a vehicle for Geordi La Forge and Troi , but it was decided to include Ro instead as one of the lead characters . Ro had been included as one of three lead characters in Morgan Gendel 's original pitch for the episode " The Inner Light " . This would have seen her in a love triangle with Picard and Riker . Instead , the concept was redeveloped to focus solely on Picard . 
 Forbes made a single appearance in the sixth season , in the episode " Rascals " . In the plot of the episode , a transporter accidentally turns Ro , among others , in a child . There was some consideration after the episode about whether or not to keep Ro as a child , as her return to adulthood was never shown on screen . Taylor said that the change would have been " too drastic for us " , and the idea was abandoned . Her final appearance , in the penultimate episode of the series , " Preemptive Strike " , had been considered a long shot by the producers . After the failure to agree her appearances on Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , Forbes ' agent had warned them to stay away from her . A week prior to filming , there was no story created for the episode other than the idea it would follow on from the Deep Space Nine episode " The Maquis " , and no agreement had been reached with Forbes to appear . Her agent indicated that Forbes wanted to talk directly to the producers , so she made the phone call , making up a story for the episode as the conversation went on . Forbes agreed , making her final appearance in the franchise . The character was promoted to Lieutenant , and Forbes wore updated Bajoran makeup developed by Westmore for Deep Space Nine . 
 = = = Star Trek : Deep Space Nine = = = 
 " Ensign Ro " proved influential on the creation of Deep Space Nine , with the Bajorans and Cardassians taken directly from the episode . The character was included in the original series description , stationed on the Bajor @-@ based Starfleet station and the producers had planned for her to be promoted to Lieutenant in an episode of The Next Generation prior to the start of Deep Space Nine . Taylor had expected Ro to be written out of The Next Generation , and so had taken some steps to see that the character was replaced . She said that " We all just love Michelle Forbes " , but the plans to replace Ro would not seek to add someone with the type of fire shown by the character in such episodes as " The Next Phase " . She also said that if Ro to remain on The Next Generation , then the character would have naturally evolved away from that conflicted position anyway . 
 The intention was that Ro would be one of a handful of The Next Generation characters moving over to the new series , alongside Miles and Keiko O 'Brien . At this stage , the other characters were only described as a wheelchair @-@ bound science officer , a brash doctor , a civilian law enforcer , a bar owner and the station commander and his son . Ro 's position on the station would have been to act as the liaison between the station and the Bajoran government . As described in the series bible , the producers had planned for Ro to be a point of conflict with " by @-@ the @-@ book Starfleet officers " . Regarding the other main characters , she was planned to have a friendship with Odo and be mentored by Jadzia Dax . 
 Both Berman and Piller sought to have Forbes sign on to portray Ro as a main character in the series , but she turned them down . She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation , but did not want to tie herself down to a five to six year main cast contract at that point in her career . She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series , and did not want to undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine . The producers of Deep Space Nine decided create a new character to fit a similar mould , which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys , who was played by Nana Visitor . This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time , which was already under production . During the course of the series , Forbes told interviewers that she was interested in making one @-@ off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role .

 In accordance with Bajoran tradition , her family name precedes her personal name . When she first joins the crew of the Enterprise @-@ D during the course of " Ensign Ro " , Captain Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) addresses her as " Ensign Laren " . She corrects him , saying that Laren is her given name and Ro is her family name . She is then referred to as " Ensign Ro " . Over the course of her several appearances in The Next Generation , information is revealed about her backstory . Bajor had been under the occupation of the Cardassians during her early life , and at the age of seven she watched as one of the occupiers tortured her father to death . This led to a life @-@ long hatred of Cardassians . 
 Ro joined Starfleet , and after being posted to the USS Wellington , she formed part of an away team . During that mission , she disobeyed orders , resulting in the death of eight crewmen . She was subsequently court @-@ martialled , and was imprisoned on Jaros II . Admiral Kennelly ( Cliff Potts ) later gave her a pardon and allowed her to return to Starfleet service , in return for convincing the Bajoran terrorist Orta ( Jeffrey <unk> ) to call off his attacks after a raid on a Federation colony . He brings her to the USS Enterprise for the purpose of completing this mission .

 As shown in " Ensign Ro " , during an away team mission to capture Orta , Ro manages to get the team taken hostage . As a result , Picard confines her to her quarters . But Picard discovers that the Bajorans were not responsible for the attack on the Federation colony , and Guinan ( Whoopi Goldberg ) convinces Ro to tell Picard of Kennelly 's plan . Ro was under orders to offer arms to Orta , to trick him to revealing his presence so the Cardassians can destroy his vessel . At that point , Kennelly would intervene and order Picard not to intervene to keep the peace treaty with the Cardassians . Picard allows the plan to proceed , but the Cardassians destroy an empty ship before revealing that the Cardassians had staged the attack in order to enlist aid against the Bajorans . At the conclusion of the episode , Picard offers Ro a position on the crew of the Enterprise , which she accepts . 
 In " Disaster " , Ro is one of the crew trapped on the bridge of the Enterprise when it undergoes a series of power failures . The ship is placed at risk of destruction because of the potential failure of the containment fields on the antimatter pods . Ro argues that they need to separate the saucer section to save those on @-@ board it as they have no way knowing if anyone is still alive on the engineering part of the vessel . When the crew undergo group amnesia in " Conundrum " , Ro and Riker act on a mutual attraction until their memories are restored . In " The Next Phase " , Ro and La Forge apparently die after a transporter accident after returning from a Romulan Warbird . But they have suffered the side effects of a Romulan cloaking experiment . Ro initial questions whether or not she has died and is now in the afterlife . But together with La Forge they discover a Romulan plot and defeating a similarly cloaked Romulan operative , Ro and La Forge alert the crew and return to normal , warning Picard and averting disaster . 
 In the episode " Rascals " , Ro , Picard , Guinan and Keiko O 'Brien ( Rosalind Chao ) are transformed into adolescent versions of themselves while retaining their adult intelligence . As children , they foil a Ferengi plot to steal the Enterprise and sell the crew as slave labor . In her final episode , " Preemptive Strike " , Ro returns to the Enterprise as a Lieutenant after spending a year at Starfleet Advanced Tactical Training . During the course of the training , her commanding officer , Lieutenant Commander Chakotay , resigned from Starfleet to join the Marquis when his father is killed by the Cardassians . She is asked by Starfleet to infiltrate the rebel Maquis , who are undermining the Federation treaty with Cardassia . During the mission , she finds her loyalties in conflict with her duties as she becomes increasingly sympathetic to the plight of the Maquis . Despite Picard 's effort to force her to do her duty , she joins the rebel group . Riker says she seemed pretty sure she was doing the right thing , though she regretted disappointing Picard .

 Ro makes a series of appearances in the non @-@ canonical novel series based on The Next Generation . These include an expansion on her background and early life in the book Night of the Wolves by S. D. Perry and Britta Dennison . The events of the away mission while she was serving on the USS Wellington were shown in the second special issue of DC Comics ' The Next Generation series . Ro 's career with the Maquis is also chronicled in the novels . In Rogue Saucer , she is responsible for planning out the attack on the Enterprise in which the Maquis steal a prototype saucer section . Ro appears in the novel Tunnel Through the Stars , set during the events of the Dominion War , Ro and the remaining Maquis join forces with Picard and the USS Enterprise @-@ E to defeat the Dominion forces that are attempting to build an artificial wormhole to bypass the one near Deep Space Nine . 
 She began to appear in the Deep Space Nine relaunch novels beginning with the two @-@ part Avatar by Perry . The relaunch novels show the events that occur after the final episode of the television series . In Avatar , Ro enlists in the Bajoran Militia with the rank of Lieutenant , and is assigned to Deep Space Nine as the new Security Chief under the command of Colonel Kira . This move for Ro is also chronicled in the background to the massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game Star Trek Online . 
 In Twilight by David R. George III , the first part of the Mission : Gamma mini @-@ series , Quark and Ro start to develop romantic feelings for each other . In Perry 's Unity , Ro re @-@ joins Starfleet after Bajor joins the Federation and it 's military forces are merged . She is initially apprehensive about the prospect , but is convinced to accept a pardon for her time with the Maquis by Picard . Over time , Ro was promoted to Captain and as of the Star Trek : The Fall series of books , is in command of the new Deep Space Nine following the destruction of the original at the hands of a rogue element of the Typhon Pact . Ro was also one of the characters included at launch in the strategy video game Star Trek Timelines by Disruptor Beam .

 The Bajorans have been described as analogues for a variety of displaced peoples , with Star Trek novelist Keith DeCandido comparing them to " Palestinians , Jews , Kurds , Haitians ; the sad reality is that you can pretty much pick and choose . History is full of people who have had their homes taken from them , forced to become refugees . " The Cardassian occupation of Bajor ( the Bajoran homeworld ) has been compared to the Holocaust , with Ro singled out as a Holocaust survivor . In his chapter " Speakers for the Dead : Star Trek , the Holocaust , and the Representation of Atrocity " within the book Star Trek as Myth , writer Matthew Wilheim <unk> compared the experiences and reactions of Ro Laren and Kira Nerys following the Cardassian occupation of Bajor . He said that the impact on Ro represented the " non @-@ american view of the holocaust " in that she does not fully recover from the trauma and continues to affect in , for example preventing her from connecting with her religious beliefs in " The Next Phase " . He explains that Kira is a far more " Americanize [ d ] " character , acting as a " resister and even liberator " during the occupation . As a result , unlike Ro , Kira retains her religious beliefs and does not typically show any ongoing emotional trauma . Further commentary of Ro 's relationship to religion have been made . In The Literary Galaxy of Star Trek , James F. Broderick compared the situation in which Ro and La Forge are trapped out of phase in " The Next Phase " to that of the purgatory dweller in Dante Alighieri 's Inferno .

 When reviewing " Ensign Ro " for Tor.com , DeCandido described Michelle Forbes as " stellar " and called Ro " one of TNG 's best recurring characters " . He also added the the character was " a bit of piss and vinegar to add to the syrupy mix of homogeneity that the TNG cast tends to be " . In his review of " Preemptive Strike " , he said that the Ro character arc " comes full circle : once again making a decision that puts her on the outs with Starfleet . " He praised Forbes again , saying that she " inhabits the character so completely , from her awkwardness at the reception in her honor to her playing the role of rebel , to her pain at thinking about her father ... to her decision to betray Starfleet and the Enterprise . " He did criticise the episode for not wrapping up the Riker @-@ Ro relationship in the same way that closure had been given to her friendship with Picard . Zack Handlen reviewed " Ensign Ro " for The A.V. Club , and described Ro as " terrific " and said that the role represented " one of the rare times that TNG has managed to have a frustrated character who doesn 't immediately seem overly hateful or falsely confrontational " . But he criticized the manner in which her opinion changed to be more favourable of Picard and the Enterprise , as he felt that Guinan 's intervention was detrimental to the plot . 
 Ro Laren has placed in several polls featuring the characters of the franchise over the course of several years . In a list of the strongest female characters on the official Star Trek website by Jordan Hoffman in 2012 , Ro Laren was placed second behind Edith Keeler from the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " The City on the Edge of Forever " . He said that Ro was one of the " richest figures in Trek " , and wished to be able to see an alternative timeline where Forbes had accepted the main cast position on Deep Space Nine . A poll at the Creation Entertainment official Star Trek convention in 2013 , conducted by Hoffman , placed Ro Laren as the fifth most popular recurring character among fans , behind Elim Garak , Q , Gul Dukat and General Martok . Hoffman expressed a view that he had expected her to place higher in the rankings , due to the number of her vocal supporters , however she also had many booing her . On a poll run on the official Star Trek website in 2014 regarding the fans ' favourite supporting character , Ro came eighth out of ten . In 2015 , she was included in a list of the 21 " most interesting " supporting characters in the franchise by Lisa Granshaw at Blastr . Granshaw called Ro " a complicated , strong character " , and said her " different layers and motivations made her a great character to watch interact with the loyal crew of the Enterprise . "

 Frederick Henry Dyer ( July 2 , 1849 – September 21 , 1917 ) served as a drummer boy in the Union Army during the American Civil War . After the war , he wrote A Compendium of the War of the Rebellion – a complete record of every regiment formed under the Union Army , their histories , and the battles they fought in – taking forty years to compile . 
 = = Background = = 
 Born in 1849 , Dyer lost both his parents in childhood . In July 1863 , at the age of 14 , already two years into the civil war , Dyer and a friend ran away from school with the intention of joining the army . Although his friend 's aunt provided guardian consent for him to enlist as a minor , Dyer 's friend decided not to sign up . Dyer carefully assumed his friend 's surname , Metzger , to avoid being traced and returned to school . On July 25 , having passed the routine physical examination , he became a drummer boy in Company " H " of the 7th Connecticut Infantry Regiment . 
 = = Army life = = 
 Dyer continued to serve with Company " H " during the remaining two years of the war . It is unknown whether he actively participated in any fighting , and most likely would have helped the wounded during engagements . The 7th Connecticut was equipped with Spencer carbines in December 1863 , making it better equipped to fight than those armed with the slower muzzle @-@ loaded Enfield rifle . 
 The regiment saw action in several battles , during Dyer 's service , including : 
 Battle of <unk> – February 4 , 1864 
 Drewry 's Bluff – May 14 – 16 , 1864 
 Bermuda Hundred – June 14 , 1864 
 Richmond – Petersburg Campaign – June 16 , 1864 – January 3 , 1865 
 Battle of Chaffin 's Farm – September 29 – 30 , 1864 
 Battle of Darbytown Road – October 13 , 1864 
 Second Battle of Fort Fisher – January 15 , 1865 
 Battle of Wilmington – February 22 , 1865 
 On July 20 , 1865 , the regiment was mustered out of service , the war having ended in April .

 Dyer stopped using his false name after the war . He attended Russell Military Institute and Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven , Connecticut , reclaiming the education he left to become a soldier . 
 From the age of 18 , he became a commercial traveller – an occupation he maintained for about fourteen years – moving between various cities in the states of Pennsylvania and New York . He moved to Philadelphia in 1870 , where he manufactured and sold escutcheons to veterans . In 1875 he was married in Bridgeville , Delaware and moved to Pittsburgh until the fall of 1876 , then moved to Washington , Pennsylvania . Whilst living in Washington he went into business with a H. Frank Ward , forming " Dyer and Ward – Printers , Stationers and <unk> " , which ran from 1881 until 1885 . 
 Dyer moved around on business , residing in several cities between 1885 and 1912 , before settling his family in Cleveland , Ohio . In 1904 he set up a temporary residence in Des Moines , Iowa , and dedicated himself to working in isolation on the Compendium , compiling his collection of around 10 million names and dates , for almost five intense years . 
 Dyer remained in Des Moines until 1912 , to promote the Compendium from his office , before moving to Boston , Massachusetts , with his family .

 In 1867 , Dyer became a member of the Grand Army of the Republic ( GAR ) , a patriotic society of civil war Union veterans . It was around this time that he started to acquire details about Union regiments . His job as a commercial traveller brought him in touch with many veterans and officials , from whom he gathered official figures . The statistics he collected expanded into further areas , from regiments to details of formations , battles , movements , and similar data . He began to research using official records in various state capitals , and continued speaking to ex @-@ soldiers and high @-@ standing officers , such as General Sherman , who expressed interest in a comprehensive compendium and welcomed its future publication . 
 Dyer utilized the official materials available at the War Department , namely the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion . After 35 years of information gathering , he moved into a single room in Des Moines to start producing a compendium worthy of print . He made seven revisions , each taking around seven months , as he sifted through piles of paperwork and notes , to produce an accurate account of the Union army . Working day and night , sleeping in a bed placed close to his desk , he toiled over the Compendium from 1904 until 1908 , producing a 4 @,@ 025 page typed manuscript . Published on February 15 , 1909 , by " The Dyer Publishing Company " , through which he personally funded , wrote and promoted his work , printed by Torch Press of Cedar Rapids , Iowa , a total of 4 @,@ 500 copies of the Compendium were issued in a single @-@ volume edition , measuring 9 by 12 inches ( imperial octavo ) , spanning 1 @,@ 796 pages , and consisting of three parts : 
 Part I – Number and organization of the Armies of the United States . 
 Part II – Chronological record of the campaigns , battles , engagements , actions , combats , sieges , <unk> etc . , in the United States 1861 to 1865 . 
 Part III – Regimental Histories . 
 Part II also contains 90 photographs of Union soldiers and officers , maps and drawings of uniforms and battles from the civil war , but also includes reproductions of Dyer 's 1863 recruitment medical form , and several personal letters . The original Compendium , which was bound in morocco leather and pebbled cloth , sold at $ 10 apiece ( equivalent to $ 259 @.@ 26 in 2013 terms ) . 
 The Compendium was well @-@ received by civil war veterans and historians alike , who praised both its accuracy and value , as well as its thoroughness when compared to official military records .

 Dyer died on September 21 , 1917 , aged 68 , of coronary sclerosis , survived by his wife and one of three children . He was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery , Boston , Massachusetts , in the GAR New Veterans lot on Webster Avenue , in an unmarked grave ( no . 125 ) . It was his own request to be interred without a monument , stating that his Compendium would serve as a memory to his life , long after any monument had crumbled away .

 = Nemesis ( roller coaster ) = 
 Nemesis is an inverted roller coaster located at the Alton Towers amusement park in England . The ride 's concept and layout was devised by designer John Wardley . It was manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard ( B & M ) and opened in March 1994 . It is located in the Forbidden Valley area of the park , adjacent to Galactica , a B & M Flying roller coaster that originally opened in 2002 as Air . 
 The 716 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 2 @,@ 349 ft ) ride stands 13 metres ( 43 ft ) tall and features a top speed of 80 @.@ 5 kilometres per hour ( 50 @.@ 0 mph ) . The four @-@ inversion roller coaster was one of the first Bolliger & Mabillard rides to be installed outside of the United States and the first in Europe ( as an independent company ) . The ride has been very well received , consistently ranking highly in industry polls .

 In 1990 , Alton Towers added the Thunder Looper roller coaster ; the addition was only temporary due to planning restrictions imposed on its installation . The park began planning for a new roller coaster which would open prior the closure of the Thunder Looper . They desired a roller coaster that was big , different and exciting , but they were constrained by the tree @-@ level height limit imposed on the park . 
 Alton Towers approached Arrow Dynamics for the new roller coaster . The Utah @-@ based company was working on a prototype of a pipeline roller coaster , similar to TOGO 's <unk> design . John Wardley worked on the design of the ride which was originally to be themed around a secret military facility , codenamed " Secret Weapon 1 " ( SW1 ) . Due to the design of the ride and the height restriction imposed on the park , SW1 would only have a track length of 300 metres ( 980 ft ) . Development of the project was put on hold a short time into the process , due to the financial problems being encountered by Arrow at the time and technical problems with the ride 's design . The project was revived a year later under the codename " Secret Weapon 2 " ; rock blasting was used to clear more space for the larger ride . The project was again abandoned when Wardley rode the prototype , describing it as slow , boring , cumbersome and energy inefficient . The park began to look for an alternative . 
 Wardley became aware of a new roller coaster design being installed by Bolliger & Mabillard at Six Flags Great America . He subsequently entered into discussions with Six Flags who agreed to privately disclose information about the new ride , in exchange for a similar favour at a later date . Jim Wintrode , the general manager of Six Flags Great America at the time , proposed the concept of an inverted roller coaster that featured inversions . Although Wardley believed this would be impossible , Wintrode worked with Bolliger & Mabillard to develop Batman : The Ride . Wardley rode Batman : The Ride prior to its May 1992 opening and wanted to add a similar ride to Alton Towers . 
 The inverted roller coaster , then dubbed " Secret Weapon 3 " , was developed throughout 1992 . Wardley and Nick Varney , marketing director of Alton Towers , came up with the name " Nemesis " and pitched a theming concept about an alien creature trapped beneath the park . Tussauds Studios elaborated on this , creating visuals for later promotion . Wardley also worked alongside Stengel Engineering to develop a layout for the ride which was exciting for both riders and non @-@ riders ; for example , the final inversion was built at the eye level of an observer .

 The £ 10 million Nemesis officially opened to the public on 19 March 1994 , following a soft opening three days prior . It opened as one of the first Bolliger & Mabillard rides to be installed outside of the United States , along with <unk> at Himeji Central Park , Japan , which opened four months later . 
 In August 2004 , Nemesis gained the Guinness World Record for the " Most Naked People on a Rollercoaster " . The ride set the record at 32 riders – the number of seats on a single Nemesis train . It took the record from Thorpe Park 's Nemesis Inferno roller coaster which set the record at 28 just three months prior . The ride lost the record in 2010 when 40 naked riders boarded Green Scream Rollercoaster at Adventure Island . 
 In 2009 , Alton Towers received several complaints from nearby residents regarding increased noise levels emitted from the ride . New wheels had to be installed on the two trains before the ride returned to normal operation .

 " Nemesis " has received overwhelmingly positive reviews , by park visitors and the industry as a whole . The roller coaster has continuously ranked high in worldwide polls and , as of 2007 , featured queues in excess of an hour due to its popularity . More than 50 million people have ridden Nemesis since opening . 
 In Amusement Today 's annual Golden Ticket Awards , Nemesis has consistently ranked highly . It is also one of only seven roller coasters to appear in the top 50 every year since the award 's inception in 1998 . It debuted at position 10 in 1998 , before peaking at position 7 in 2003 . 
 In Mitch Hawker 's worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll , Nemesis entered at position 7 in 1999 , before dropping to a low of 12 in 2012 . The ride 's ranking in subsequent polls is shown in the table below . 
 Due to the success of Nemesis , park owners Merlin Entertainments have created two related rides . The first is Nemesis Inferno at Thorpe Park , another Bolliger & Mabillard inverted roller coaster . The ride opened in 2003 . Alton Towers hosts the second related ride , Nemesis : Sub @-@ Terra . The drop tower opened on the former Dynamo site in 2012 and closed in August 2015 due to cost @-@ cutting . 
 As a result , Nemesis is commonly compared with its Thorpe Park counterpart – Nemesis Inferno – with many citing Nemesis as the superior ride . Nemesis has ranked favourably in Amusement Today 's annual Golden Ticket Awards , being one of only seven roller coasters to appear in the top 50 steel roller coasters for all 15 years . Nemesis Inferno , on the other hand , has never made an appearance . In Mitch Hawker 's worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll Nemesis Inferno has an average ranking of 80 , while Nemesis ' average ranking is 6 . In a poll conducted by the Los Angeles Times , Nemesis received 37 @.@ 93 % of the vote for title of best roller coaster in England , while Nemesis Inferno received 0 @.@ 32 % . Jeremy Thompson of Roller Coaster Philosophy describes Nemesis as " a vastly superior ride " to Nemesis Inferno . 
 = Battle of Aachen = 
 The Battle of Aachen was a major combat action of World War II , fought by American and German forces in and around Aachen , Germany , between 2 – 21 October 1944 . The city had been incorporated into the Siegfried Line , the main defensive network on Germany 's western border ; the Allies had hoped to capture it quickly and advance into the industrialized Ruhr Basin . Although most of Aachen 's civilian population was evacuated before the battle began , much of the city was destroyed and both sides suffered heavy losses . It was one of the largest urban battles fought by U.S. forces in World War II , and the first city on German soil to be captured by the Allies . The battle ended with a German surrender , but their tenacious defense significantly disrupted Allied plans for the advance into Germany . 
 = = Background = = 
 By September 1944 , the Western Allies had reached Germany 's western border , which was protected by the extensive Siegfried Line . On 17 September , British , American , and Polish forces launched Operation Market Garden , an ambitious attempt to bypass the Siegfried Line by crossing the Lower Rhine River in the Netherlands . The failure of this operation , and an acute supply problem brought about by the long distances involved in the rapid drive through France , brought an end to the headlong Allied race toward Berlin . German casualties in France had been high - Field Marshal Walter Model estimated that his 74 divisions had the actual strength of just 25 - but the Western Allies ' logistical problems gave the Germans a respite , which they used to begin rebuilding their strength . In September , the Wehrmacht high command 's reinforcement of the Siegfried Line brought total troop strength up to an estimated 230 @,@ 000 soldiers , including 100 @,@ 000 fresh personnel . At the start of the month , the Germans had had about 100 tanks in the West ; by the end , they had roughly 500 . As men and equipment continued to flow into the Siegfried Line they were able to establish an average defensive depth of 3 @.@ 0 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) . 
 Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower , set their sights on the occupation of the Ruhr , Germany 's industrial heartland . General George S. Patton 's Third Army was given the task of occupying the French region of Lorraine , while General Courtney Hodges 's First Army was ordered to break through the front near Aachen . Hodges had initially hoped to bypass the city itself , believing it to be held only by a small garrison , which would presumably surrender once isolated . 
 The ancient , picturesque city of Aachen had little military value in itself , as it was not a major center of war production . Its population of around 165 @,@ 000 had not been subject to heavy bombing by the Allies . It was , however , an important symbol to both the Nazi regime and the German people ; not only was it the first German city threatened by an enemy during World War II , it was also the historic capital of Charlemagne , founder of the " First Reich . " As such , it was of immense psychological value . The mindset of the city 's defenders was further altered by the different attitude the local population had toward them as they fought on home soil for the first time ; one German officer commented , " Suddenly we were no longer the Nazis , we were German soldiers . " 
 Aachen and its sector of the front were protected by the Siegfried Line , consisting of several belts of inter @-@ connected pillboxes , forts , and bunkers protected by extensive minefields , " dragon 's teeth " anti @-@ tank obstacles , and barbed wire entanglements . In several areas , German defenses were over 10 miles ( 16 km ) deep . It was , in the words of historian Stephen Ambrose , " undoubtedly the most formidable man @-@ made defense ever contrived . " Learning from their experiences on the Eastern Front , the Germans ran their main line of resistance down the center of towns located in the defensive wall , taking advantage of narrow streets to limit the mobility of enemy armored vehicles . Despite the low quality of many of the troops manning them , the fortifications protecting Aachen and the Ruhr were a formidable obstacle to the progress of American forces , who saw a breakthrough in this sector as crucial , as the terrain behind Aachen was generally flat , and therefore highly favorable to the motorized Allied armies . 
 Fighting around Aachen began as early as the second week of September , in a period known to the Germans as the " First Battle of Aachen " . At this time , the city was defended by the 116th Panzer Division , under the command of General Gerhard von Schwerin . The proximity of Allied forces had caused the majority of the city 's government officials to flee before the evacuation of its citizens was complete . ( For this , Hitler had all Nazi officials who had fled stripped of rank and sent to the Eastern front as privates . ) Instead of continuing the evacuation , von Schwerin opted to surrender the city to Allied forces ; however , on 13 September , before he could deliver a letter of capitulation he had written , von Schwerin was ordered to launch a counterattack against American forces penetrating southwest of Aachen , which he did , using elements of his panzergrenadier forces . The German general 's attempt to surrender the city would soon become irrelevant , as his letter was never delivered ; instead , it fell into the hands of Adolf Hitler , who ordered the general 's immediate arrest . He was replaced by General Gerhard <unk> . The United States ' VII Corps continued to probe German defenses , despite the resistance encountered on 12 – 13 September . Between 14 – 16 September the US 1st Infantry Division continued its advance in the face of strong defenses and repeated counterattacks , ultimately creating a half @-@ moon arc around the city . This slow advance came to a halt in late September , due to the supply problem , and the diversion of existing stocks of fuel and ammunition for Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands .

 = = = German defenders in Aachen = = = 
 The Wehrmacht took advantage of the brief respite on the front by pulling the 1st , 2nd and 12th SS Panzer Divisions , as well as the 9th and 116th Panzer Divisions , off the line . In October , responsibility for the Aachen sector 's defense was given to General Friedrich <unk> 's LXXXI Corps , which included the 183rd and 246th Volksgrenadier Divisions , as well as the 12th and 49th Infantry Divisions . These forces , along with the attached 506th Tank Battalion and 108th Tank Brigade , numbered roughly 20 @,@ 000 men and 11 tanks . <unk> was also promised a reformed 116th Panzer Division and the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division , numbering a total of some 24 @,@ 000 personnel . The 246th Volksgrenadier Division replaced the 116th Panzer Division in Aachen proper , the 183rd Volksgrenadier Division and 49th Infantry Division defended the northern approaches , and the 12th Infantry Division was positioned to the south . On 7 October , elements of the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler were released to reinforce the defense of Aachen . 
 Although reinforcements continued to arrive , LXXXI Corps ' units suffered heavily ; the 12th Infantry Division had lost half its combat strength between 16 – 23 September , and the 49th and 275th Infantry Divisions had had to be pulled off the line to recuperate . While German infantry divisions generally had a strength of 15 @,@ 000 – 17 @,@ 000 soldiers at the start of World War II , this had gradually been reduced to an official ( table of organization ) size of 12 @,@ 500 , and by November 1944 , the average actual strength of a Heer division was 8 @,@ 761 men . In an attempt to cope with the manpower shortages plaguing the Wehrmacht , the Volksgrenadier divisions were created in 1944 . Their average total strength was just over 10 @,@ 000 men per division . Although about 1 ⁄ 4 of these were experienced veterans , half were fresh conscripts and convalescents , while the remainder were <unk> from the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine . These divisions often received the newest small @-@ arms , but were deficient in artillery and <unk> , severely limiting their tactical usefulness . In the case of LXXXI Corps , the 183rd Volksgrenadier Division , though <unk> by 643 men , had only been activated in September , meaning that the division had not had time to train as a unit . The 246th Volksgrenadier Division was in a similar state , many of its personnel having received fewer than ten days of infantry training . All of these deficiencies of personnel were offset somewhat by the inherent strength of the well @-@ planned , well @-@ constructed fortifications surrounding Aachen . 
 = = = American forces = = = 
 The task of taking Aachen fell to General Charles H. Corlett 's XIX Corps ' 30th Infantry Division and Joseph Collins ' VII Corps ' 1st Infantry Division . General Leland Hobbs ' 30th Infantry Division would be assisted by the 2nd Armored Division , which would exploit the 30th Division 's penetration of the Siegfried Line , while their flanks were protected by the 29th Infantry Division . In the south , 1st Infantry Division was supported by the 9th Infantry Division and the 3rd Armored Division . These divisions had used the brief respite in the fighting during the last two weeks of September to rest and refit , taking in a large number of replacements . By 1 October , over 70 % of the men of General Clarence Huebner 's 1st Infantry Division were replacements , and the last two weeks of September were spent giving these men village @-@ fighting and weapons training . The impending offensive 's plan called for both infantry divisions to avoid street fighting in Aachen ; instead , the two divisions would link up and encircle the city , assigning a relatively small force to capture it while the bulk of US forces continued pushing east . 
 Although American units were usually able to replenish their numbers quickly , the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training . Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities . Some tankers were shipped to Europe without having so much as driven a car before ; some tank commanders were forced to teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions . The American replacement system , which focused on quantity over quality , ensured that the majority of fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat . It was not unusual for half of a unit 's replacements to become casualties within the first few days of combat . These tremendous frontline losses required ever @-@ more troops to be fed into the fighting ; for instance , a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18 – 21 October . 
 These forces were supported by the Ninth Air Force , which had pin @-@ pointed 75 % of the pillboxes along the frontlines and planned an opening bombardment including 360 bombers and 72 fighters ; fresh aircraft would be used for a second aerial wave , which included the use of napalm . With the Germans having few anti @-@ aircraft batteries and severely limited support from the Luftwaffe , Allied dominance of the sky over Aachen was near total . 
 = = Battle = = 
 For six days prior to the beginning of the American offensive , Allied heavy artillery targeted German defenses around Aachen . Although the heavy bombardment forced the German LXXXI Corps to halt all daylight personnel and supply movements , it had little effect on the pillboxes and strongpoints . The opening aerial bombardment on 2 October also caused little damage to German defensive positions ; the 450 aircraft which took part in the first wave failed to register a single direct hit on any German pillbox . Their targets had been largely obscured by thick smoke from the Allied artillery barrage . As the aircraft finished their assault , the artillery resumed bombarding the front lines , firing 18 @,@ 696 shells from 372 gun tubes within a couple of hours . 
 = = = Advance from the north : 2 – 8 October = = = 
 The 30th Infantry Division began its advance on 2 October , using divisional heavy artillery to target German pillboxes ; even then it took , on average , thirty minutes to capture a single pillbox . The Americans found that if they failed to immediately press on to the next pillbox , the Germans were sure to counterattack . Heavy resistance had not been expected , and one company lost 87 combatants in an hour ; another lost 93 out of 120 soldiers to a German artillery strike . The attackers were slowly able to cross the Wurm River and engage German pillboxes with flamethrowers and explosive charges . By the afternoon of 2 October , elements of the 30th Infantry Division had breached German defenses and reached the town of <unk> . Here , GIs advanced house @-@ to @-@ house and fought a number of gruesome hand grenade duels . ( Private Harold G. Kiner would be awarded the Medal of Honor for throwing himself on a German grenade near <unk> , thus saving the lives of two fellow soldiers ) . Fighting in the town of <unk> was equally terrible ; American armor had not been able to get across the Wurm River , and therefore could not provide fire support to infantrymen who were attempting to storm a medieval castle being used as a fort by the Germans . The 30th Infantry Division subdued roughly 50 German pillboxes on the first day of the advance , often having to envelop the structure and attack from the rear . The division 's effort was aided by the 29th Infantry Division 's diversionary attacks on their flank , leading the Germans to believe that that was the Americans ' main attack . On the night of 2 October , the German <unk> Assault Gun Battalion was ordered to launch a counterattack against the 30th Infantry Division , but Allied artillery delayed the start of the raid , and ultimately the attempt failed . 
 Although American armor became available to support the advance on 3 October , the attacking forces were brought to an abrupt halt after a number of German counterattacks . The town of <unk> was taken on the second day of the offensive , but fighting through German defenses remained slow as M4 Sherman tanks and 155 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 1 in ) artillery guns were brought up to blast pillboxes at point blank range . Fighting had also begun to develop for the town of Übach , where American tanks rushed in to take the town , only to be pinned down by German artillery . Fierce counterattacks followed , with American artillery fire narrowly preventing the Germans from retaking it . By the end of the day , the forcing of the Wurm River and the creation of a bridgehead had cost the 30th Infantry Division around 300 dead and wounded . 
 German forces continued their counterattacks on Übach , suffering heavy casualties to American artillery and infantry fire . Although the inability to retake Übach persuaded German commanders that they had insufficient forces to properly defend the approaches to Aachen , the counterattacks did tie down American troops which could have otherwise continued the advance . On 4 October , the Allied advance was limited , with only the towns of <unk> and <unk> taken , the Americans having lost roughly 1 @,@ 800 soldiers in the past three days of combat . Better progress was made on 5 October , as the 119th Regiment of the 30th Infantry Division captured <unk> @-@ <unk> . The following day the Germans launched another counterattack against Übach , again failing to dislodge the Americans . German armor was unable to cope with the overwhelming numerical superiority of the American tanks , and as a last @-@ ditch effort to halt the advance the Germans began concentrated attacks on American positions with what artillery and aircraft they could muster . They found themselves severely hamstrung by lack of reserves , although General <unk> was able to deploy a Tiger detachment to the town of Alsdorf in an attempt to plug the American penetration of Aachen 's northern defenses . 
 A counterattack developed on 8 October , composed of an infantry regiment , the 1st Assault Battalion , a battle group of the 108th Panzer Brigade , and some 40 armored fighting vehicles scavenged from available units . Although hindered by American artillery , the left wing of the attack managed to cut off an American platoon , while the right wing reached a road junction north of the town of Alsdorf . A platoon of Shermans supporting an attack on the town of <unk> suddenly found themselves being attacked from the rear , and were able to repel the Germans only after heavy fighting . Two German Sturmgeschütz IV self @-@ propelled assault guns and a squad of infantry entered Alsdorf , where they were heavily counterattacked . Although the two lumbering vehicles somehow eluded American tanks , they were finally engaged by American infantry and forced back to their starting point . With casualties mounting and the Americans drawing closer , the German high command transferred the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division to Aachen , followed by the I SS Panzer Corps , which included the 116th Panzer Division and SS Heavy Panzer Battalion 101 , an element of the 1st SS Panzer Division . 
 = = = Advance from the south : 8 – 11 October = = = 
 In the south , the 1st Infantry Division began its offensive on 8 October , aiming to capture the town of <unk> and Hill 231 ( dubbed " Crucifix Hill " ) near the town of <unk> . Their attack was preceded by a massive artillery barrage , which helped them seize their objectives quickly . On Crucifix Hill , Captain Bobbie E. Brown , commander of C Company , 18th Infantry , personally silenced three pillboxes with pole charges and , despite being wounded , continued to lead his men into the attack , earning the Medal of Honor . By 10 October , the 1st Infantry Division was at its designated position for link @-@ up with the 30th Infantry Division . This success was met with a German counterattack toward Hill 231 , which was the scene of an intense firefight ; the battle ended with the Germans leaving over 40 dead and 35 prisoners . Despite repeated German counterattacks slowing its advance , the 1st Infantry Division was able to capture the high ground surrounding the city . 
 On 10 October , General Huebner delivered an ultimatum to German forces in Aachen , threatening to bomb the city into submission if the garrison didn 't surrender . The German commander categorically refused . In response , American artillery began to pound the city on 11 October , firing an estimated 5 @,@ 000 shells , or over 169 short tons ( 153 t ) of explosives ; it was also subjected to intense bombardment by American aircraft . 
 = = = Link up : 11 – 16 October = = = 
 American casualties were climbing , both from frequent German counterattacks and the cost of storming pillboxes . The Germans had spent the night of 10 October turning cellars of houses in the town of <unk> into fortified pillboxes ; American attackers were forced to withdraw and instead shell the town into submission . On 12 October , the Germans launched a major counterattack against the American 30th Infantry Division . It was disrupted by heavy artillery fire and well @-@ placed anti @-@ tank defenses . At the village of Birk , a three @-@ hour fight broke out between German tanks and a single American Sherman ; the Sherman managed to knock out an enemy Panzer IV and force another one to withdraw , but was soon attacked by others . This lone tank was eventually joined by elements of the 2nd Armored Division , and the Germans were driven from the town . The 30th Infantry Division soon found itself in defensive positions all along its front ; nevertheless , it was ordered to continue pushing south for its intended link @-@ up with the 1st Infantry Division . To accomplish this , two infantry battalions from the 29th Infantry Division were attached to the hard @-@ pressed 30th . 
 The same day ( 12 October ) , to the south , two German infantry regiments attempted to retake Crucifix Hill from GIs of the 1st Infantry Division . In fierce fighting the Germans temporarily took control of the hill , but were dislodged by the end of the day , with both regiments virtually destroyed . From 11 – 13 October , Allied aircraft bombarded Aachen , selecting targets closest to American lines ; on 14 October , the 26th Infantry Regiment was ordered to clear an industrial zone on the edge of Aachen in preparation for the attack on the city itself . On 15 October , in an effort to widen the gap between the two American pincers , the Germans again counterattacked the 1st Infantry Division ; although a number of heavy tanks managed to break through American lines , the bulk of the German forces were destroyed by artillery and air support . On the next day , the Germans attempted to mount local counterattacks with the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division , but , after sustaining heavy losses , were forced to suspend further offensive action . 
 The 30th Infantry Division , with elements of the 29th Infantry and 2nd Armored divisions , continued its push southwards between 13 – 16 October , in the sector of the village of <unk> ; however , even with heavy air support , they were unsuccessful in breaking through German defenses and linking up with allied forces to the south . The Germans took advantage of the narrow front to pound advancing attackers with artillery , and progress remained slow as German tanks used houses as bunkers to surprise and overwhelm American foot soldiers . General Hobbs , commander of the 30th Infantry Division , then attempted to outflank the German defenses by attacking along another sector with two infantry battalions . The attack was a success , allowing the 30th and 1st Infantry Divisions to link up on 16 October . The fighting had so far cost the American XIX Corps over 400 dead and 2 @,@ 000 wounded , with 72 % of those from the 30th Infantry Division . The Germans had not fared any better , as up to 14 October around 630 of their soldiers had been killed and 4 @,@ 400 wounded ; another 600 were lost in the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division 's counterattack on the US 1st Infantry Division on 16 October . 
 = = = Fight for the city : 13 – 21 October = = = 
 Needing most of its manpower to stave off German counterattacks and secure the area around Aachen , the 1st Infantry Division was able to earmark only a single regiment for the job of taking the city . The task fell to the 26th Infantry Regiment , which had only two of its three battalions on hand . Armed with machine guns and flamethrowers , the 2nd and 3rd Infantry Battalions would at first be aided only by a few tanks and a single 155 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 1 in ) howitzer . The city was defended by roughly 5 @,@ 000 German troops , including converted navy , air force and city police personnel . For the most part , these soldiers were inexperienced and untrained , and were only supported by a handful of tanks and assault guns . However , Aachen 's defenders could make use of the maze of streets which occupied its historical center . 
 The 26th Infantry 's initial attack on 13 October provided important insight on the nature of the fighting ; American infantry had been ambushed by German defenders using sewers and cellars , forcing the advancing American infantry to clear each opening before continuing down streets , while Sherman tanks found it impossible to maneuver to suppress enemy fire . German civilians were cleared as the 26th Infantry advanced ; no Germans were allowed to remain in the Americans ' rear . Success in Aachen was measured by the number of houses captured , as the advance proved to be sluggish ; in order to cope with the thick walls of the older buildings in the city , the 26th Infantry Regiment used howitzers at point blank range to destroy German fortifications . The howitzer created passageways that allowed infantrymen to advance from building to building without having to enter the city 's streets , where they could be pinned down by enemy fire . Sherman tanks were ambushed , as they entered intersections , by concealed German anti @-@ tank guns . Soon thereafter , American tanks and other armored vehicles would advance cautiously , often shooting buildings ahead of the accompanying infantry to clear them of possible defenders . Pinned on the surface by Allied aircraft , German infantrymen would use sewers to deploy behind American formations to attack them from the rear . German resistance was fierce , as they launched small counterattacks and used armor to halt American movements . 
 On 18 October , the 3rd Battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment prepared to assault the Hotel Quellenhof , which was one of the last areas of resistance in the city . American tanks and other guns were firing on the hotel , which was the city 's defense headquarters , at point blank range . That night , 300 soldiers of the 1st SS Battalion were able to reinforce the hotel and defeat several attacks on the building . A furious German counterattack managed to overrun a number of American infantry positions outside of the hotel , and temporarily released pressure on the Quellenhof before being beaten off by concerted American mortar fire . 
 Two events then aided the final advance . First , to lessen frontline infantry casualties , it was decided to barrage remaining German strongpoints with 155 mm guns . Secondly , to assist the 1st Infantry Division , a battalion of the 110th Infantry Regiment , US 28th Infantry Division , had been moved up from the V Corps sector on 18 October to close a gap between forward 26th Infantry Regiment elements within the city . The defensive mission of this new battalion was changed on 19 – 20 October to closely support the urban assault , participating as the depleted regiment 's missing third battalion . On 21 October , soldiers of the 26th Infantry Regiment , supported by the reinforced battalion of the 110th Infantry Regiment finally conquered central Aachen ; that day also marked the surrender of the last German garrison , in the Hotel Quellenhof , ending the battle for the city . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Battle of Aachen had cost both the Americans and Germans dearly ; the former suffered over 5 @,@ 000 casualties , while the latter lost over 5 @,@ 000 casualties and 5 @,@ 600 taken prisoner . Since 2 October 1944 , the 30th Infantry Division suffered roughly 3 @,@ 000 men killed and wounded , while the 1st Infantry Division took at least 1 @,@ 350 casualties ( 150 killed and 1 @,@ 200 wounded ) . The Germans lost another 5 @,@ 100 casualties during the fighting in Aachen itself , including 3 @,@ 473 prisoners . In the process of the battle , the Wehrmacht lost two complete divisions and had another eight severely depleted , including three fresh infantry divisions and a single refitted armored division ; this was largely attributed to how they fought , as although an equivalent of 20 infantry battalions had been used during various counterattacks against the 30th Infantry Division alone , on average each separate attack only involved two infantry regiments . During the conflict , the Germans also developed a respect for the fighting ability of American forces , noting their capability to fire indiscriminately with overwhelming amounts of artillery fire support and armored forces . Both the 30th Infantry and 1st Infantry divisions received distinguished unit citations for their actions at Aachen . 
 However , German resistance in Aachen upset Allied plans to continue their eastward advance . Following the end of fighting in Aachen , the Western Allies ' First Army was tasked with the capture of a series of dams behind the Hürtgen Forest , which could be used by the Germans to flood the valleys which opened the road to Berlin . This would lead to the Battle of Hürtgen Forest , which was to prove more difficult than the Battle of Aachen . 
 = Steuart Wilson = 
 Sir James Steuart Wilson ( 21 July 1889 – 18 December 1966 ) was an English singer , known for tenor roles in oratorios and concerts in the first half of the 20th century . After the Second World War he was an administrator for several organisations including the Arts Council of Great Britain , the BBC and the Royal Opera House . 
 Following service in the First World War , Wilson became known for singing tenor roles in oratorios by composers from Bach to Elgar , and was particularly admired both as the Evangelist in Bach 's St Matthew Passion and in the title role of The Dream of Gerontius . He was a champion of music by English composers of his generation , notably Ralph Vaughan Williams , Gustav Holst and Rutland Boughton . He also appeared from time to time in operatic tenor roles , including <unk> in the first professional performance of Holst 's Savitri . The quality of his voice and even his technique , though , was not universally admired . In a high @-@ profile libel case Wilson sued a member of the public who had criticised one of his performances in a letter , and the BBC for publishing it : he won £ 2 @,@ 000 in damages . 
 In 1937 Wilson settled for a while in the United States , teaching at the Curtis Institute of Music . He retired from singing and returned to the United Kingdom in 1942 where he began a second career as an administrator . He initially worked for the BBC , then after the war was appointed music director of the newly created Arts Council of Great Britain ; in 1948 he was knighted for his services in that post . That same year he became the BBC 's director of music , and infamously engineered the enforced retirement of the BBC Symphony Orchestra 's chief conductor , Adrian Boult . The following year he became deputy general administrator of the Royal Opera House , in which post he secured the premiere staging of Vaughan Williams 's The Pilgrim 's Progress in 1951 . Unhappy with being subordinate to the Royal Opera 's general administrator , David Webster , Wilson resigned from his post in June 1955 and started a campaign against homosexuals in the musical profession . Wilson ended his career as principal of the Birmingham School of Music , 1957 – 1960 .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Wilson was born in Bristol , the youngest child of the Rev. James Maurice Wilson , headmaster of Clifton College who was once described as " something of a theological firebrand " . Steuart 's elder brother was Arnold Talbot Wilson , later the colonial administrator of Mesopotamia . Wilson was educated at Winchester College and King 's College , Cambridge , where he read classics but developed a strong interest in music . During that time he formed friendships with Clive Carey , Edward J. Dent and Ralph Vaughan Williams . Wilson 's first public appearance as a singer was in Vaughan Williams 's incidental music for Aristophanes ' The Wasps in 1909 , and he made his first appearance in opera as <unk> in Mozart 's The Magic Flute in 1911 . 
 At the outbreak of the First World War Wilson volunteered for service and was commissioned in the army . He served in France and was twice wounded , then worked in the Intelligence Bureau of the General Staff at the War Office and General Headquarters in France . Authorities differ on whether the wounds , which resulted in the loss of a lung and a kidney , affected his singing voice . The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that they did not ; Frank Howes , writing in 1951 , and The Times in its obituary , both state that they did . 
 = = = Singing career = = = 
 After the war , Wilson developed an interest in early English music and was instrumental in founding the London @-@ based sextet , the English Singers , in 1920 . The following year he sang the role of <unk> in the first professional performance of Gustav Holst 's Savitri , at the Lyric Theatre , Hammersmith . 
 In 1921 Wilson met A. H. Fox Strangways , editor of the newly founded journal Music and Letters ; they discovered a shared interest in making practical translations of Lieder texts , Wilson having only recently encountered Schubert Lieder , and collaborated on and published volumes of Schubert , Schumann and Brahms translated into English . Wilson later made an English translation of the texts set in Mahler 's Das Lied von der Erde 
 From 1921 to 1923 Wilson taught music at Bedales School , an appointment that left him time to take singing engagements all over the United Kingdom . In 1924 he left the English Singers and furthered his singing studies abroad , first in Nice with Jean de Reszke ( 1924 – 25 ) , with whom he learned the roles of Otello , Parsifal and Tristan ; he then took lessons with Sir George Henschel ( 1925 – 28 ) , and studied 17th- and 18th @-@ century music with Wanda Landowska in Paris . 
 For a while Wilson sang with the Bristol Opera Company , which toured in London to perform at the Royal Court Theatre in 1927 and 1928 , conducted by Adrian Boult and Malcolm Sargent . Productions mounted included Ralph Vaughan Williams 's The Shepherds of the Delectable Mountains , and Charles Villiers Stanford 's The Travelling Companion . 
 Wilson became a leading interpreter of the Evangelist in JS Bach 's Passions , and of the title part in Edward Elgar 's The Dream of Gerontius , which he sang under the baton of the composer and other conductors including Hamilton Harty , Malcolm Sargent , Albert Coates , and Adrian Boult . The Times called him " the best exponent of [ Gerontius ] at the present time " . The tenor Peter Pears said that it was hearing Wilson singing as Evangelist in Bach 's St Matthew Passion that " started me off " . 
 Mozart remained part of Wilson 's repertoire at the Old Vic ( though Howard Ferguson complained " Steuart Wilson would sing out of tune " ) , and he regularly championed English music , making regular appearances at Rutland Boughton 's festival in Glastonbury and on occasion at Napier Miles 's festivals in Bristol . He was praised by Holst , who credited him with rescuing the British National Opera Company production which had previously " ruined " his opera At the Boar 's Head . 
 Writing in 1968 , The Gramophone critic Roger Fiske recalled that Wilson " stood out above other tenors both for high intelligence and for clarity of words , though his voice was not by nature of especial beauty ; also he never sang quite as well in performance as at rehearsal , his tone tightening under stress . " Frank Howes made similar observations in an article published in 1951 , though noting that " intelligence " was a recognised euphemism for " indifferent vocal equipment " . A more recent judgement , based on recordings of Schubert Lieder , describes " Wilson 's stentorian and rather stiff delivery — the fast vibrato , his tendency to rush ( slower songs sound better ) and the impression that he is distinctly <unk> in the higher register " , all of which " does not make for a satisfactory performance according to today 's standards . " 
 For many years , Adrian Boult had been a close friend of Wilson and his first wife Ann , née Bowles . When , in the late 1920s , Wilson began to mistreat his wife , Boult took her side . She divorced Wilson on grounds of cruelty in 1931 , and married Boult two years later . The enmity provoked in Wilson was to have lasting repercussions . The stigma attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson 's career : he was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival for 25 years until 1957 , when he narrated Honegger 's King David in Worcester , by which time his singing career had ended . 
 = = = BBC libel case = = = 
 Wilson achieved a wider fame for his successful libel action against the BBC in what became known as " the case of the intrusive H " . In 1933 , the BBC had printed in the 14 April edition of its magazine The Radio Times a letter from a retired schoolmaster who , having heard a broadcast of the St Matthew Passion , accused Wilson of the technical fault of aspirating his runs in decorated music : " I am amazed that the BBC could engage anyone quite so incompetent in his breath control . … ' Pilate 's wife ' became ' <unk> @-@ <unk> 's <unk> @-@ <unk> ' ; ' High Priest ' was turned into ' High @-@ high <unk> @-@ <unk> ' ; ' Purple robe ' into ' Purple ro @-@ <unk> ' ; ' to ' into ' too @-@ hoo ' , and so on throughout the entire performance . It was simply ghastly . " When Wilson complained , the BBC initially offered to publish an apology in The Radio Times , but then took exception when Wilson demanded £ 5 @,@ 000 in damages . 
 Wilson sued the BBC . The corporation vigorously defended its action on the grounds that the letter was justified criticism of a performer . Wilson questioned the letter writer 's competence to pass judgement on his performance : while Wilson conceded that he used the " intrusive H " , as a legitimate ornament which his teacher , Jean de Reszke , inserted into several works , and admitted that he had used it at two points in his broadcast performance , neither of these occurrences had been pointed out in the letter . Furthermore , two of the letter 's cited examples , " Pilate 's Wife " and " purple robe " , did not appear in his part of the work at all . During the three @-@ day court case several expert witnesses were called , including Clive Carey who brought as evidence a score annotated by de Reszke . The judge , Lord Hewart , urged the jury to be " extremely liberal " : after 45 minutes deliberation , the jury decided against the BBC and the letter writer , and awarded Wilson £ 2 @,@ 000 damages . The BBC chose not to appeal and shouldered the entire cost : in an internal memo the BBC Director General , John Reith , observed that in such cases a British jury would tend to favour the individual , rather than a corporation , and that to appeal might appear an unjustified use of the BBC 's monetary power . 
 Wilson used the money he won in the libel case to support a London production of Boughton 's opera The Lily Maid , which he himself conducted at the Winter Garden Theatre in January 1937 . He was praised for his assured beat and experienced direction . 
 = = = USA = = = 
 In 1937 Wilson settled for a time in the United States with his second wife , Mary ( who was a cellist ) , and joined the faculty at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia ; there he taught singing , English diction , vocal repertoire , and vocal ensemble . He continued to give recitals into the early 1940s . In 1941 he resigned from the Curtis Institute in protest against the dismissal of the director Randall Thompson , and the following year the Wilsons returned to England . This was the end of Wilson 's career as a singer , he himself observing , " The whole place [ America ] is jammed full of singers from every country in the world , all rampaging around for jobs . " 
 = = = Musical administrator = = = 
 Wilson joined the BBC in 1942 " in a minor capacity with hopes of preferment " . The following year he was appointed music director for the BBC Overseas Service . After the war he was appointed music director of the Arts Council of Great Britain , newly formed from the wartime Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts ( CEMA ) , and he helped reorganise the music department for peacetime work . In that post , he gave support to Benjamin Britten 's English Opera Group in the first year of its existence , recommending to the Council that the group should " be awarded a grant of not less than £ 3000 and closer to £ 5000 " . He subsequently accepted an invitation to give a lecture at the first Aldeburgh Festival , speaking on 10 June 1948 on " The Future of Music in England " . 
 In April 1948 , the year in which he was knighted for his services as director of the Arts Council , he became the BBC 's director of music following the sudden death of Victor Hely @-@ Hutchinson . The Times described this appointment as " not a success " , and it is chiefly remembered for the controversy Wilson provoked by engineering the forced retirement of Boult as chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra . In the 1930s Boult had been promised informally by the Corporation 's then director @-@ general , John Reith , that he would be exempt from the BBC 's rule that staff retire at age 60 . However , Reith left the BBC in 1938 and his promise carried no weight with his successors . Wilson , on being appointed director of music , made clear to the BBC 's director @-@ general , William Haley , that he intended to have Boult replaced as chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra , and used his authority to insist on Boult 's enforced retirement . Haley was unaware of Wilson 's personal animus against Boult and later acknowledged , in a broadcast tribute to Boult , that he " had listened to ill @-@ judged advice in retiring him . " 
 In 1949 Wilson , aged 60 , moved to Covent Garden to take the post of deputy general administrator of the Royal Opera House . While in that position he gave support to the Polish composer Andrzej Panufnik , who had recently defected from communist Poland , by introducing him to the concert agent Harold Holt . Wilson was responsible for securing the premiere of Vaughan Williams 's The Pilgrim 's Progress at the Royal Opera House in 1951 . Wilson resented being subordinate to the general administrator , David Webster , and he resigned from his Royal Opera House post in June 1955 . The following month it was announced that he was launching " a campaign against homosexuality in British music " and was quoted as saying : " The influence of perverts in the world of music has grown beyond all measure . If it is not curbed soon , Covent Garden and other precious musical heritages could suffer irreparable harm . " 
 Wilson 's last major appointment was as principal of the Birmingham School of Music , 1957 – 1960 , but this is described by Grove as " an unhappy episode " . The Gramophone critic Roger Fiske commented that Wilson " ' administered ' with an aggressive sensitivity and wit that veered between the inspired and the impossible " . 
 He was an enthusiastic member of the Tolhurst Society which existed in Oxford in the 1960s and 70s . At performances of the oratorio " Ruth " he would sing ( an octave down ) the Alto aria " I went out full , and the Lord hath sent me home again empty " . His characterization of the word " empty " is remembered by all who heard him . 
 Wilson died in 1966 in Petersfield , Hampshire , aged 77 .

 On a recording made in 1927 during a performance at the Royal Albert Hall , London , Wilson sings in extracts from The Dream of Gerontius conducted by the composer . He also recorded Vaughan Williams 's On Wenlock Edge , and songs by Denis Browne . 
 = Malcolm Sargent = 
 Sir Harold Malcolm Watts Sargent ( 29 April 1895 – 3 October 1967 ) was an English conductor , organist and composer widely regarded as Britain 's leading conductor of choral works . The musical ensembles with which he was associated included the Ballets Russes , the Huddersfield Choral Society , the Royal Choral Society , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company , and the London Philharmonic , Hallé , Liverpool Philharmonic , BBC Symphony and Royal Philharmonic orchestras . Sargent was held in high esteem by choirs and instrumental soloists , but because of his high standards and a statement that he made in a 1936 interview disputing musicians ' rights to tenure , his relationship with orchestral players was often uneasy . Despite this , he was co @-@ founder of the London Philharmonic , was the first conductor of the Liverpool Philharmonic as a full @-@ time ensemble , and played an important part in saving the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from disbandment in the 1960s . 
 As chief conductor of London 's internationally famous summer music festival the Proms from 1948 to 1967 , Sargent was one of the best @-@ known English conductors . When he took over the Proms from their founder , Sir Henry Wood , he and two assistants conducted the two @-@ month season between them . By the time he died , he was assisted by a large international roster of guest conductors . 
 At the outbreak of the Second World War , Sargent turned down an offer of a major musical directorship in Australia and returned to the UK to bring music to as many people as possible as his contribution to national morale . His fame extended beyond the concert hall : to the British public , he was a familiar broadcaster in BBC radio talk shows , and generations of Gilbert and Sullivan devotees have known his recordings of the most popular Savoy Operas . He toured widely throughout the world and was noted for his skill as a conductor , his championship of British composers , and his debonair appearance , which won him the nickname " Flash Harry . "

His father , Henry Sargent , was a coal merchant , amateur musician and part @-@ time church organist ; his mother , Agnes , née Hall , was the matron of a local school . Sargent was brought up in Stamford , Lincolnshire , where he joined the choir at Peterborough Cathedral , studied the organ and won a scholarship to Stamford School . At the age of 14 , he accompanied rehearsals for amateur productions of The Gondoliers and The Yeomen of the Guard at Stamford . At the age of 16 he earned his diploma as Associate of the Royal College of Organists , and at 18 he was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Music by the University of Durham . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Sargent worked first as an organist at St. Mary 's Church , Melton Mowbray , Leicestershire , from 1914 to 1924 , except for eight months in 1918 when he served as a private in the Durham Light Infantry during the First World War . He was chosen for the organist post over more than 150 other applicants . At the same time , he worked on many musical projects in Leicester , Melton Mowbray and Stamford , where he not only conducted but also produced the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan and others for amateur societies . The Prince of Wales and his entourage often hunted in Leicestershire and watched the annual Gilbert and Sullivan productions there , together with the Duke of York and other members of the Royal Family . At the age of 24 Sargent became England 's youngest Doctor of Music , with a degree from Durham . 
 Sargent 's break came when Sir Henry Wood visited De Montfort Hall , Leicester , early in 1921 with the Queen 's Hall orchestra . As it was customary to commission a piece from a local composer , Wood invited Sargent to write a piece entitled Impression on a Windy Day . Sargent completed the work too late for Wood to have enough time to learn it , and so Wood called on Sargent to conduct the first performance himself . Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent 's talent as a conductor and gave him the chance to make his debut conducting the work at Wood 's annual season of promenade concerts , generally known as the Proms , in the Queen 's Hall on 11 October of the same year . 
 Sargent as composer attracted favourable notice in a Prom season when other composer @-@ conductors included Gustav Holst with his Planets suite , and the next year , Wood included a nocturne and scherzo by Sargent in the Proms programme , also conducted by the composer . Sargent was invited to conduct the Impression again in the 1923 season , but it was as a conductor that he made the greater impact . On the advice of Wood , among others , he soon abandoned composition in favour of conducting . He founded the amateur Leicester Symphony Orchestra in 1922 , which he continued to conduct until 1939 . Under Sargent , the orchestra 's prestige grew until it was able to obtain such top @-@ flight soloists as Alfred Cortot , Artur Schnabel , Solomon , <unk> <unk> and Benno Moiseiwitsch . Moiseiwitsch gave Sargent piano lessons without charge , judging him talented enough to make a successful career as a concert pianist , but Sargent chose a conducting career . At the instigation of Wood and Adrian Boult he became a lecturer at the Royal College of Music in London in 1923 . 
 = = = National fame = = = 
 In the 1920s , Sargent became one of the best @-@ known English conductors . For the British National Opera Company , he conducted The Mastersingers on tour in 1925 , and for the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company , he conducted London seasons at the Prince 's Theatre in 1926 and the newly rebuilt Savoy Theatre in 1929 – 30 . He was criticised in The Times 's review of 20 September 1926 for adding " gags " to the Gilbert and Sullivan scores , although the writer praised the crispness of the ensemble , the " <unk> " of the performance and the beauty of the overture . Rupert D 'Oyly Carte wrote to the paper stating that , in fact , Sargent had worked from Arthur Sullivan 's manuscript scores and had merely brought out the " details of the orchestration " exactly as Sullivan had written them . Some of the principal cast members and the stage director , J. M. Gordon , objected to Sargent 's fast tempi , at least at first . The D 'Oyly Carte seasons brought Sargent 's name to a wider public with an early BBC radio relay of The Mikado in 1926 heard by up to eight million people . The Evening Standard noted that this was " probably the largest audience that has ever heard anything at one time in the history of the world . " 
 In 1927 , Sergei Diaghilev engaged Sargent to conduct for the Ballets Russes , sharing the conducting duties with Igor Stravinsky and Sir Thomas Beecham . Sargent also conducted for the final Ballets Russes season in 1928 . In 1928 he became conductor of the Royal Choral Society , and he retained this post for four decades until his death . The society was famous in the 1920s and 1930s for staged performances of Samuel Coleridge @-@ Taylor 's Hiawatha at the Royal Albert Hall , a work with which Sargent 's name soon became synonymous . 
 Elizabeth Courtauld , wife of the industrialist and art collector Samuel Courtauld , promoted a popular series of subscription concerts beginning in 1929 and on Schnabel 's advice engaged Sargent as chief conductor , with guest conductors as eminent as Bruno Walter , Otto Klemperer and Stravinsky . The Courtauld @-@ Sargent concerts , as they became known , were aimed at people who had not previously attended concerts . They attracted large audiences bringing Sargent 's name before another section of the public . In addition to the core repertory , Sargent introduced new works by Bliss , Honegger , Kodály , Martinů , Prokofiev , Szymanowski and Walton , among others . At first , the plan was to engage the London Symphony Orchestra for these concerts , but the orchestra , a self @-@ governing co @-@ operative , refused to replace key players whom Sargent considered sub @-@ standard . As a result , in conjunction with Beecham , Sargent set about establishing a new orchestra , the London Philharmonic . 
 In these years Sargent tackled a wide repertoire , recording much of it , but he was particularly noted for performances of choral pieces . He promoted British music , as he would throughout his career , conducting Handel 's Messiah performed with large choruses and orchestras ; and the premières of At the Boar 's Head ( 1925 ) by Holst ; Hugh the Drover ( 1924 ) and Sir John in Love ( 1929 ) by Vaughan Williams ; and Walton 's cantata Belshazzar 's Feast ( at the Leeds Triennial Festival of 1931 ) . To popularise classical music , Sargent conducted many concerts for young people including the Robert Mayer Concerts for Children from 1924 to 1939 . 
 = = = Difficult years and war years = = = 
 In October 1932 , Sargent suffered a near @-@ fatal attack of tuberculosis . For almost two years he was unable to work , and it was only later in the 1930s that he returned to the concert scene . In 1936 , he conducted his first opera at Covent Garden , Gustave Charpentier 's Louise . He did not conduct opera there again until 1954 , with Walton 's Troilus and Cressida , although he did conduct the incidental music for a dramatisation of The Pilgrim 's Progress given at the Royal Opera House in 1948 . 
 As an orchestra conductor , Sargent had already been known as a hard taskmaster . According to The Independent , he brought professionalism to orchestras by shaking them free of dead wood , clearing out talented <unk> and pushing the survivors to perform at their best through relentless rehearsal . After giving a Daily Telegraph interview in 1936 in which he said that an orchestral musician did not deserve a " job for life " and should " give of his lifeblood with every bar he plays , " Sargent lost much favour with musicians . They were particularly annoyed because of their support of him during his long illness , and thereafter he faced frequent hostility from British orchestras . 
 Being popular in Australia with players as well as the public , Sargent made three lengthy tours of Australia and New Zealand in 1936 . He was on the point of accepting a permanent appointment with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation when , at the outbreak of the Second World War , he felt it his duty to return to his country , resisting strong pressure from the Australian media for him to stay . During the war , Sargent directed the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester ( 1939 – 42 ) and the Liverpool Philharmonic ( 1942 – 48 ) and became a popular BBC Home Service radio broadcaster . He helped boost public morale during the war by extensive concert tours around the country conducting for nominal fees . On one famous occasion , an air raid interrupted a performance of Beethoven 's Symphony No. 7 . Sargent stopped the orchestra , calmed the audience by saying they were safer inside the hall than fleeing outside , and resumed conducting . He later said that no orchestra had ever played so well and that no audience in his experience had ever listened so intently . In May 1941 Sargent conducted the last performance held in the Queen 's Hall . Following an afternoon performance of Elgar 's The Dream of Gerontius , the hall was destroyed during a night @-@ time incendiary raid . 
 In 1945 Arturo Toscanini invited Sargent to conduct the NBC Symphony Orchestra . In four concerts Sargent chose to present all English music , with the exception of Sibelius 's Symphony No. 1 and Dvořák 's Symphony No. 7 . Two concertos , Walton 's Viola Concerto with William Primrose , and Elgar 's Violin Concerto with Yehudi Menuhin , were programmed as part of these concerts . Menuhin judged Sargent 's conducting of the latter " the next best to Elgar in this work . " 
 = = = The Proms and later years = = = 
 Sargent was knighted for his services to music in 1947 and performed in numerous English @-@ speaking countries during the post @-@ war years . He continued to promote British composers , conducting the premieres of Walton 's opera , Troilus and Cressida ( 1954 ) , and Vaughan Williams 's Symphony No. 9 ( 1958 ) . 
 Sargent was chief conductor of the Proms from 1948 until his death in 1967 and of the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1950 to 1957 , succeeding Sir Adrian Boult . One author has written that " Sargent sometimes ruffled the orchestra in a way that Boult had never done . Indeed there were many people inside the BBC who profoundly regretted Boult 's departure . " The same author contended that Sargent was the target of criticism from the BBC 's own Music Department for " not devoting enough time to the orchestra . " Norman Lebrecht goes so far as to say that Sargent " almost wrecked " the BBC orchestra . 
 Although the orchestra players bridled at some of Sargent 's initiatives , there was also praise for his work with the orchestra . His biographer Reid contended , " Sargent 's liveliness and drive soon gave BBC playing a gloss and briskness which had not been conspicuous before . " Another biographer , Aldous , wrote , " Everywhere Sargent and the orchestra performed there were ovations , laurel wreaths and terrific reviews . " The orchestra 's reputation both in Britain and internationally grew during Sargent 's tenure . The conductor had " great moments of triumph ... both at festivals overseas and during the Proms . " In the 1950s and 1960s he made many recordings with the BBC Symphony , as well as other ensembles , as described below . In this period , also , he conducted the concerts that opened the Royal Festival Hall in 1951 and returned to the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company for the summer 1951 Festival of Britain season at the Savoy Theatre and the winter 1961 – 62 and 1963 – 64 seasons at the Savoy . In August 1956 the BBC announced that he would be replaced as Chief Conductor of the BBC orchestra by Rudolf Schwarz . Sargent was given the title of " Chief Guest Conductor " and he remained Conductor @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Proms . 
 As chief conductor of the Proms , Sargent gained his widest fame , making the " Last Night " into a high @-@ ratings broadcast celebration aimed at ordinary audiences , a popular , theatrical flag @-@ waving extravaganza presided over by himself . He was noted for his witty addresses in which he good @-@ naturedly chided the noisy <unk> . In his programmes for these concerts he often conducted choral music and music by British composers , but his range was broad : the BBC 's official history of the Proms lists selected programmes from this period showing Sargent conducting works by Bach , Sibelius , Dvořák , Berlioz , Rachmaninoff , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , Richard Strauss and Kodály in three successive programmes . During his chief conductorship , prestigious foreign conductors and orchestras began to perform regularly at the Proms . In his first season in charge , Sargent and two assistant conductors conducted all the concerts among them ; by 1966 there were Sargent and 25 other conductors . Those making their Prom debuts in the Sargent years included Carlo Maria Giulini , Georg Solti , Leopold Stokowski , Rudolf Kempe , Pierre Boulez and Bernard Haitink . 
 Sargent made two tours of South America . In 1950 he conducted in Buenos Aires , Montevideo , Rio de Janeiro and Santiago . His programmes included Vaughan Williams 's London and 6th Symphonies ; Haydn 's Symphony No. 88 , Beethoven 's Symphony No. 8 , Mozart 's Jupiter symphony , Schubert 's 5th , Brahms 's 2nd and 4th , Sibelius 's 5th , Elgar 's Serenade for Strings , Britten 's The Young Person 's Guide to the Orchestra , Strauss 's Till Eulenspiegel 's Merry Pranks , Walton 's Viola Concerto and Dvořák 's Cello Concerto with Pierre Fournier . In 1952 Sargent conducted in all the above @-@ mentioned cities and also in Lima . Half his repertory on that tour consisted of British music and included Delius , Vaughan Williams , Britten , Walton and Handel . 
 When the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was in danger of extinction after Beecham 's death in 1961 , Sargent played a major part in saving it , doing much to win back the good opinion of orchestral players that he had lost because of his 1936 interview . In the 1960s , Sargent toured Russia , the United States , Canada , Turkey , Israel , India , the Far East and Australia . By the mid @-@ 1960s his health began to deteriorate . 
 Sargent underwent surgery in July 1967 for pancreatic cancer but made a valedictory appearance at the end of the last night of the Proms in September that year , handing over the baton to his successor , Colin Davis . He died two weeks later , at the age of 72 . He was buried in Stamford cemetery alongside members of his family . 
 = = = Musical reputation and repertoire = = = 
 Toscanini , Beecham and many others regarded Sargent as the finest choral conductor in the world . Even orchestral musicians gave him credit : the principal violist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra wrote of him , " He is able to instil into the singers a life and efficiency they never dreamed of . You have only to see the eyes of a choral society screwing into him like hundreds of <unk> to understand what he means to them . " However , another of Sargent 's colleagues , Sir Adrian Boult , said of him , " [ H ] e was a great all @-@ rounder but never developed his potentialities , which were enormous , simply because he didn 't think hard enough about music – he never troubled to improve on a successful interpretation . He was too interested in other things , and not single @-@ minded enough about music . " 
 Although orchestral players resented Sargent for much of his career after the 1936 interview , instrumental soloists generally liked working with him . The cellist Pierre Fournier called him a " guardian angel " and compared him favourably with George Szell and Herbert von Karajan . Artur Schnabel , Jascha Heifetz and Yehudi Menuhin thought similarly highly of him . Cyril Smith wrote in his autobiography , " ... he seems to sense what the pianist wants of the music even before he begins to play it .... He has an incredible speed of mind , and it has always been a great joy , as well as a rare professional experience , to work with him . " For this reason , among others , Sargent was continually in demand as a conductor for concertos . 
 The Times obituary said Sargent " was of all British conductors in his day the most widely esteemed by the lay public ... a fluent , attractive pianist , a brilliant score @-@ reader , a skilful and effective arranger and orchestrator ... as a conductor his stick technique was regarded by many as the most accomplished and reliable in the world .... [ H ] is taste ... was moulded by the Victorian cathedral tradition into which he was born . " It commented that , in his later years , his interpretations of the standard classical and romantic repertoire were " prepared ... down to the last detail " but sometimes " <unk> " , though his performances of " the music composed within his lifetime ... remained lucid and continually compelling . " The flute player Gerald Jackson wrote , " I feel that [ Walton ] conducts his own music as well as anyone else , with the possible exception of Sargent , who of course introduced and always makes a big thing of Belshazzar 's Feast . " 
 The composers whose works Sargent regularly conducted included , from the eighteenth century , Bach , Handel , Gluck , Mozart and Haydn ; and from the nineteenth century , Beethoven , Berlioz , Schubert , Schumann , Mendelssohn , Brahms , Wagner , Tchaikovsky , Smetana , Sullivan and Dvořák . From the twentieth century , British composers in his repertoire included Bliss , Britten , Delius , Elgar ( a favourite , especially Elgar 's choral works The Dream of Gerontius , The Apostles and The Kingdom and symphonies ) , Holst , Tippett , Vaughan Williams and Walton . With the exception of Alban Berg 's Violin Concerto , Sargent avoided the works of the Second Viennese School but programmed works by Bartók , Dohnányi , Hindemith , Honegger , Kodály , Martinů , Poulenc , Prokofiev , Rachmaninoff , Shostakovich , Sibelius , Strauss , Stravinsky and Szymanowski .

 In 1923 , Sargent married Eileen Laura Harding Horne , daughter of Frederic Horne of <unk> , Suffolk . Sargent 's biographers differ on her background . Aldous states that she was a maid in domestic service , whereas Reid notes that she was a keen rider , with many friends in hunting circles , and that her uncle ( who officiated at her wedding to Sargent ) was rector of Drinkwater , Suffolk . According to Aldous , it was believed locally that Sargent had to marry Horne , having made her pregnant . By 1926 , the couple had two children , a daughter Pamela who died of polio in 1944 , and a son Peter . Sargent was much affected by his daughter 's death , and his recording of Elgar 's The Dream of Gerontius in 1945 was an expression of his grief . 
 Sargent 's marriage was unhappy and ended in divorce in 1946 . Before , during and after his marriage , Sargent was a continual womaniser , a fact that he did not deny . His liaisons with powerful women began early , in Stamford , when he was still conducting the Gilbert and Sullivan shows attended by the London gentry who came to join the Melton Mowbray hunt . Among his affairs were long @-@ standing ones with Diana Bowes @-@ Lyon , Princess Marina and Edwina Mountbatten . More casual encounters are typified by the young woman who said , " Promise me that whatever happens I shan 't have to go home alone in a taxi with Malcolm Sargent . " 
 Away from music , Sargent was elected a member of The Literary Society , a dining club founded in 1807 by William Wordsworth and others . He was also a member of the Beefsteak Club , for which his proposer was Sir Edward Elgar , the Garrick , and the long @-@ established and aristocratic White 's and Pratt 's clubs . His public service appointments included the joint presidency of the London Union of Youth Clubs , and the presidency of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . 
 Sargent 's moral character attracted comment throughout his life . Early on , he developed a taste for luxury : Adrian Boult commented on his travelling to college by taxi , but Sargent rejoined , " All the more room for you , Adrian , on the bus . " Despite Sargent 's vanities and rivalries , he had many friends . Sir Thomas Armstrong in a 1994 broadcast interview stressed that Sargent " had many good generous virtues ; he was kind to many people , and I loved him .... " Nevertheless , even friends such as Sir Rupert Hart @-@ Davis , Secretary of the Literary Society , considered him a " bounder " , and the composer @-@ suffragette Dame Ethel Smyth called him a " cad " . Yet despite his philandering and ambition , Sargent was a deeply religious man all his life and was comforted on his deathbed by visits from the Anglican Archbishop of York , Donald Coggan and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster , Cardinal Heenan . He also received calls from Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles , and had a reconciliation with his son , Peter , from whom he had been estranged for a year . 
 = = = " Flash Harry " = = = 
 A number of purported explanations have been advanced for Sargent 's nickname , " Flash Harry " . Reid opines that it " was first in circulation among orchestral players before the war and that they used it in no spirit of adulation . " It may have arisen from his impeccable and stylish appearance – he always wore a red or white carnation in his buttonhole ( the carnation is now the symbol of the school named for him ) . This was perhaps reinforced by his brisk tempi early in his career , and by a story about his racing from one recording session to another . Another explanation , that he was named after cartoonist Ronald Searle 's St Trinian 's character " Flash Harry " , is certainly wrong : Sargent 's nickname was current long before the first appearance of the St Trinian 's character in 1954 . Sargent 's devoted fans , the <unk> , used the nickname in an approving sense , and shortened it to " Flash " , though Sargent was not especially keen on the sobriquet , even thus modified . 
 Beecham and Sargent were allies from the early days of the London Philharmonic to Beecham 's final months when they were planning joint concerts . They even happened to share the same birthday . When Sargent was incapacitated by tuberculosis in 1933 , Beecham conducted a performance of Messiah at the Albert Hall to raise money to support his younger colleague . Sargent loved Beecham 's company , and took in good part his quips , such as his reference to the rising conductor Herbert von Karajan , as " a kind of musical Malcolm Sargent " and , on learning that Sargent 's car was caught in rifle fire in Palestine , " I had no idea the Arabs were so musical . " Beecham declared that Sargent " is the greatest choirmaster we have ever produced ... he makes the buggers sing like blazes . " And on another occasion he said that Sargent was " the most expert of all our conductors – myself excepted of course . " 
 = = = Honours and memorials = = = 
 In addition to his own doctorate from Durham , Sargent was awarded honorary degrees by the Universities of Oxford and Liverpool and by the Royal Academy of Music , the Royal College of Organists , the Royal College of Music and the Swedish Academy of Music . He was awarded the highest honour of the Royal Philharmonic Society , its Gold Medal , in 1959 . Foreign honours included the Order of the Star of the North ( Sweden ) , 1956 ; the Order of the White Rose ( Finland ) , 1965 ; and Chevalier of France 's Légion d 'honneur , 1967 . 
 After his death Sargent was commemorated in a variety of ways . His memorial service in Westminster Abbey in October 1967 was attended by 3 @,@ 000 people including the royalty of three countries , official representatives from France , South Africa , and Malaysia , and notables as diverse as Princess Marina of Kent ; Bridget D 'Oyly Carte ; Pierre Boulez ; Larry Adler ; Elgar 's daughter ; Beecham 's widow ; Douglas Fairbanks Junior ; Léon Goossens ; the Master of the Queen 's Music ; the Secretary of London Zoo ; and representatives of the London orchestras and of the <unk> . Colin Davis and the BBC Chorus and Symphony Orchestra performed the music . 
 Since 1968 , the year after Sargent 's death , the Proms have begun on a Friday evening rather than as previously a Saturday , and in memory of Sargent 's choral work , a large @-@ scale choral piece is customarily given . Beyond the world of music , a school and a charity were named after him : the Malcolm Sargent Primary School in Stamford and the Malcolm Sargent Cancer Fund for Children . Merging with another charity ( Cancer and Leukaemia in Childhood ) in 2005 , it is now known as CLIC Sargent and is the UK 's leading children 's cancer charity . In 1980 the Royal Mail put the image of Sargent on its <unk> postage stamp in a series portraying British conductors , the other three featuring Wood , Beecham and Barbirolli . At Albert Hall Mansions , next to the Albert Hall , where Sargent lived , there is a blue plaque placed in his memory . 
 = = Recordings = = 
 Sargent 's own composition , Impression on a Windy Day , has been recorded for CD by the Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Gavin Sutherland on the ASV label . Sargent 's first recordings as a conductor , made for HMV in 1923 using the acoustic process , were of excerpts from Vaughan Williams 's opera Hugh the Drover . In the early days of electrical recording , he took part in a pioneering live recording of extracts of Mendelssohn 's Elijah at the Albert Hall with the Royal Choral Society . 
 Subsequently in the recording studio , Sargent was most in demand to record English music , choral works and concertos . He recorded prolifically and worked with many orchestras , but made the most recordings ( several dozen major pieces ) with the BBC Symphony Orchestra ( BBC ) , the London Symphony Orchestra ( LSO ) , the New Symphony Orchestra of London , the Philharmonia Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra ( RPO ) . 
 = = = English music = = = 
 Sargent conducted Gilbert and Sullivan recordings in four different decades . His early recordings with the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company for HMV included The Yeomen of the Guard ( 1928 ) , The Pirates of Penzance ( 1929 ) , Iolanthe ( 1930 ) , H.M.S. Pinafore ( 1930 ) , Patience ( 1930 ) , Yeomen ( excerpts 1931 ) , Pirates ( excerpts 1931 ) , The Gondoliers ( excerpts 1931 ) , Ruddigore ( 1932 ) and Princess Ida ( 1932 ) . More than 30 years later , for Decca , he recorded Yeomen ( 1964 ) and Princess Ida ( 1965 ) with the D 'Oyly Carte company . In addition , between 1957 and 1963 , Sargent recorded nine of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas for EMI , with the Glyndebourne Festival Chorus and soloists from the world of oratorio and grand opera . These were Trial by Jury , Pinafore , Pirates , Patience , Iolanthe , The Mikado , Ruddigore , Yeomen and The Gondoliers . According to the Gilbert and Sullivan scholar Marc Shepherd , " The [ Glyndebourne ] recordings ' musical excellence is undisputed , but many listeners object to Sargent 's lugubrious tempi and the singers ' lack of feeling for the G & S idiom . " Sargent used an orchestra of thirty @-@ seven players at the Savoy Theatre ( the same number as Sullivan ) , but sometimes added a few more when recording . 
 During the Second World War , Sargent and the Liverpool Philharmonic accompanied Albert Sammons , the dedicatee , in his 1944 recording of the Delius Violin Concerto . Later , in 1965 , with Jacqueline du Pré , in her début recording , Sargent recorded Delius 's Cello Concerto , coupled with the Songs of Farewell ( 1965 ) . At the end of the war , Sargent turned to recording Elgar . A recording regularly chosen over all others in comparative surveys is the first of Sargent 's two versions of Elgar 's The Dream of Gerontius with Heddle Nash as tenor and the familiar Sargent pairing of the Huddersfield Choral Society and the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra , recorded in 1945 . Sargent was also the conductor for Heifetz 's 1949 recording of Elgar 's Violin Concerto and Paul Tortelier 's first recording of the Cello Concerto in 1954 . He also recorded Elgar 's Wand of Youth Suite No. 2 , with the BBC ; the Pomp and Circumstance Marches 1 and 4 with the LSO ; and the Enigma Variations with the Philharmonia . Sargent made two recordings of Holst 's The Planets : a monaural version with the LSO for Decca ( 1950 ) and a stereo version with the BBC for EMI ( 1960 ) . He also recorded shorter Holst pieces : the Perfect Fool ballet music and the Beni Mora suite . 
 In 1958 Sargent recorded Walton 's Belshazzar 's Feast , one of his specialities , which was reissued on CD in 1990 and again in 2004 . Sargent recorded Walton 's Façade Suites in 1961 . With the LSO , Sargent recorded Walton 's Orb and Sceptre March . He also made a stereo recording of Walton 's First Symphony in the presence of the composer , but Walton privately preferred André Previn 's recording , issued in January 1967 , the same month as Sargent 's . Of Vaughan Williams 's shorter pieces , Sargent recorded , with the BBC in 1960 , the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis ( which he also recorded with the Philharmonia ) , and with the LSO , Serenade to Music ( 1957 ; choral version ) and Toward the Unknown Region . He also recorded Vaughan Williams 's overture The Wasps with the LSO . 
 Although the heyday of live performances of Sargent 's Coleridge @-@ Taylor signature piece at the Albert Hall was by then long gone , Sargent , the Royal Choral Society and the Philharmonia made a stereo recording in 1962 of Hiawatha 's Wedding Feast , which has been reissued on CD . In 1963 , Sargent recorded Gay 's The Beggar 's Opera , one of his few operas on record other than Gilbert and Sullivan . This was also reissued on CD . 
 = = = Other choral recordings = = = 
 In addition to those choral pieces mentioned above , Sargent recorded Handel 's Messiah four times , in 1946 , 1954 1959 and 1964 . Though the advent of " authentic " period performance at first relegated Sargent 's large scale and rescored versions to the shelf , they have been reissued and are now attracting favourable critical comment as being of historical interest in their own right . Sargent also conducted the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and the Huddersfield Choral Society in recordings of Handel 's Israel in Egypt and Mendelssohn 's Elijah in 1947 , both of which have been reissued on CD .

 Sargent was continually in demand as a conductor for concertos . In addition to the concertos noted above , other composers whose concertos he conducted on record , with soloists noted , include : Bach ( Heifetz @-@ Friedman , NSO ) , Bartók ( <unk> , LSO ) , Beethoven ( Oistrakh , <unk> , <unk> , Philharmonia ) , Bliss ( Trevor Barnard , Philharmonia ) , Bruch ( Heifetz , LSO and NSO ) , Cimarosa ( Léon Goossens | Goossens , Royal Liverpool Philharmonic ) , Dvořák ( Tortelier ) , Mendelssohn ( Gioconda de Vito , LSO ) , Mozart ( Heifetz , LSO ) , Rachmaninoff ( Lympany , RPO ) , <unk> ( Curzon ; Matthews , LSO ) , Rubbra ( Matthews , LSO ) , Schumann ( Pierre Fournier ) , Tchaikovsky ( Ricci , NSO ) and Vieuxtemps ( Heifetz , NSO ) . Other soloists included Mstislav Rostropovich and Cyril Smith . 
 = = = Other recordings = = = 
 Neville Cardus said of Sargent 's Beethoven , " I have heard performances which critics would have raved about had some conductor from Russia been responsible for them conducting them half as well and truthfully . " Sargent recorded Beethoven 's Fourth and Fifth Symphonies for Decca with Sidney Beer 's National Symphony Orchestra . His 1940s accompaniments for Artur Schnabel in the piano concertos have been admired . A 1961 stereo recording of the Eroica Symphony has been reissued on CD . Sargent was an enthusiastic champion of Sibelius 's music , even recording it with the Vienna Philharmonic when it was not part of their repertory . Their recordings of Finlandia , En saga , The Swan of Tuonela and the Karelia Suite were issued in 1963 and reissued on CD in 1993 . Sargent and the BBC recorded the first , second and fifth Symphonies in 1956 and 1958 respectively , reissued on CD in 1989 , as well as Pohjola 's Daughter in 1959 . He also recorded the Valse triste with the RLPO . 
 Sargent recorded a wide variety of other European composers , including Bach 's Sinfonia from the Easter Oratorio , with Goossens and the RLPO ; Chopin 's Les Sylphides ballet suite ( LPO ) ; Grieg 's Lyric Suite ( National Symphony Orchestra ) ; Haydn 's Symphony No. 98 ( LSO ) ; Rachmaninoff 's Paganini Rhapsody ( Cyril Smith , RLPO ) among others ; and Wagner 's " Prelude " from Das Rheingold and " Ride of the Valkyries " from Die Walküre . He also recorded Smetana 's complete Má vlast cycle with the RPO in 1964 . With the Royal Opera Orchestra he recorded , among other pieces , Gioachino Rossini 's ballets William Tell and La Boutique Fantasque , Prokofiev 's Sinfonia Concertante , and Schubert 's Unfinished Symphony , Rosamunde and Overture <unk> . 
 With the LSO , he recorded Modest Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition and Night on Bald Mountain , Prokofiev 's Symphony No. 5 and Lieutenant Kijé Suite , and Shostakovich 's Symphony No. 9 . With the Philharmonia , he recorded , among other things , Rachmaninoff 's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini , Tchaikovsky 's Variations on a Rococo Theme and Theme and Variations from Suite No. 3 , and Dvořák 's Symphonic Variations . With the BBC , he also recorded Rachmaninoff 's Symphony No. 3 , Handel 's Water Music , which he also recorded with the RPO , Tchaikovsky 's Symphony No. 5 , Mendelssohn 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream incidental music , Humperdinck 's overture to Hänsel und Gretel , and one of Britten 's best known works , The Young Person 's Guide to the Orchestra ( 1946 , RLPO ; 1958 , BBC ) . Sargent narrated and conducted the accompanying Instruments of the Orchestra , an educational film produced by the British government . He also conducted Britten 's Simple Symphony with the RPO . 
 = Hurricane Raymond ( 1989 ) = 
 Hurricane Raymond was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 1989 Pacific hurricane season , peaking as a strong Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . Forming out of a tropical wave on September 25 , the tropical depression slowly tracked northwest before becoming nearly stationary the next day . Shortly after , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Raymond and took a general westward track . Gradually intensifying , Raymond attained hurricane @-@ status on September 28 and attained its peak intensity on October 31 , with winds of 145 mph ( 233 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 935 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 61 inHg ) . Steady weakening then took place and by October 3 , Raymond turned northeast towards land . The storm continued to weaken as it accelerated and eventually made landfall on the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm late on October 4 and a second landfall in Sonora , Mexico . Shortly after , Raymond weakened to a depression as it tracked inland . The remnants of the system persisted until October 7 when it dissipated over the Central United States . 
 Due to the rapid motion of the storm , little impact was felt in Mexico . Moderate rain fell in association with Raymond , peaking at 4 @.@ 72 in ( 120 mm ) in Nogales . There , flooding destroyed a bridge and nearby store , leaving $ 250 @,@ 000 in damage . The remnants of Raymond produced more significant damage in the United States . Tucson , Arizona recorded 4 @.@ 5 in ( 110 mm ) of rain from the storm , resulting in flash flooding that reached a depth of 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) in some places . In nearby Willcox , flood waters inundated roughly 75 % of the city . High winds from the storm also resulted in one fatality after a mobile home was destroyed . In all , damage throughout Arizona amounted to $ 1 @.@ 5 million . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Raymond originated out of a tropical wave that also spawned Hurricane Hugo in early @-@ September . With little convective development , the wave tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean , entering the Caribbean Sea several days later . By September 22 , shower and thunderstorm activity increased as it crossed Central America and entered the eastern Pacific basin . By September 24 , the wave had become sufficiently organized for the Dvorak Technique to be implemented on the system . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) estimated that the wave spawned Tropical Depression Twenty One @-@ E about 200 miles ( 320 km ) south of Acapulco , Mexico . Operationally , the NHC did not begin issuing advisories on the depression until September 26 ; at that time , the system 's outflow developed and the depression was nearly stationary as a mid @-@ level low over Mexico moved south . Shortly after , the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm and given the name Raymond by the NHC . 
 Raymond maintained a small area of deep convection around the center of circulation ; however , outflow gradually became restricted due to the upper @-@ level trough over Mexico . Southerly wind shear around the storm began to increase late on September 27 in response to a cutoff low developing over southern Texas and northern Mexico ; this led to a decrease in shower and thunderstorm activity with the system , preventing intensification . By this time , the storm had resumed a general westward track . The following day , the storm intensified into a hurricane , the ninth and final of the season , after an eye developed . Throughout September 29 , the eye became more defined on satellite imagery , indicating intensification . Later that day , Raymond strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane . Early on October 1 , Raymond reached its peak intensity with winds of 145 mph ( 233 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 935 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 61 inHg ) . Shortly after , the eye increased in size but became less symmetrical , indicating that the storm was beginning to weaken . 
 By October 2 , convection surrounding the eye warmed and Raymond was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane as it began to slow in a weak steering environment . Early the next day , the now Category 2 hurricane turned northeast and quickly accelerated in response to an approaching long @-@ wave trough . Later on October 3 , the cyclone further weakened to a Category 1 storm as an eye was no longer present in the circulation . Increasing wind shear and decreasing water temperatures sped up the rate of weakening as Raymond approached the Baja California Peninsula . Around 2300 UTC on October 4 , the center of the storm made landfall in the municipality of Ensenada in Mexican state of Baja California with winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . After briefly crossing the Gulf of California , the storm made its second and final landfall in the state of Sonora with winds of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) . Shortly after moving inland , Raymond weakened to a tropical depression and quickly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Arizona in the Southwest United States . The upper @-@ level remnants of the hurricane persisted until October 7 over the Midwest region .

 Around 0300 UTC on October 4 , the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for areas between Punta Abreojos and San Carlos on the Pacific coast of Baja California and for areas between Santa Rosalía to Loreto on the Gulf coast of the Peninsula . Roughly twelve hours later , the warning was superseded by another tropical storm warning . The new warning was issued for areas between Punta Abreojos and El Rosario on the Pacific coast and for areas between Santa Rosalia and Punta Final on the Gulf coast . In mainland Mexico , a tropical storm watch was issued for coastal areas of Sonora between Cabo Lobos and Puerto <unk> . By 1830 UTC , all of the watches and warnings were revised ; on the Pacific coast of Baja California , the warning was in effect for areas between Punta Abreojos and San Juanico ; on the Gulf coast , the warning was in effect for areas between Santa Rosalia and Punta Conception ; the watch for coastal areas of Sonora was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for areas between Guaymas and Cabo Lobos . Following Raymond 's landfall in mainland Mexico , all warnings were discontinued by 1200 UTC on October 5 . 
 Since Raymond had significantly weakened prior to its first landfall , only minor impacts were recorded in Mexico . The fast forward speed of the storm limited the amount of rain in the Baja California Peninsula , with only a small area receiving more than 3 in ( 76 mm ) . The highest rainfall was recorded in Nogales at 4 @.@ 72 in ( 120 mm ) . In the city , the swollen Santa Cruz River destroyed a heavily traveled bridge , known as the Calle Obregon , and a store which was situated on the banks of the river . Mexican officials estimated damages in Nogales at $ 250 @,@ 000 .

 The day prior to Raymond 's impacts in the United States , weather forecasts in Arizona indicated that heavy rainfall associated with the remnants of the storm were likely to trigger flash flooding and landslides , with rainfall rates reaching 0 @.@ 5 in / h ( 12 @.@ 5 mm / h ) . Flash flood watches were issued for parts of southern Arizona as well as mountainous and northern parts of New Mexico between October 5 and 6 . Rainfall in excess of 3 in ( 76 mm ) fell in parts of southern Arizona ; with the highest in the state recorded near Tucson at 4 @.@ 5 in ( 110 mm ) . Several locations recorded wind gusts up to 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) ; however , mountaintops possibly received winds in excess of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) . The highest total in the United States was recorded in Independence , Kansas at 3 @.@ 91 in ( 99 mm ) . 
 Fifteen streets in the city of Tucson were closed as floodwaters reached 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) in the worst hit areas . The Tucson Electric Power Company reported that parts of the city were without power for eight hours on October 5 due to the storm . The hardest hit area was Willcox ; roughly 75 % of the city was under 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) of floodwaters . Runoff , mixed with sewage , contaminated a wastewater @-@ treatment plant ; cleanup took several days before the plant was operational . Several businesses were flooded , with the Wilcox Auction Barn and the <unk> Apple Packing Plant both containing about 1 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) of water . The Sulphur Springs Valley Electric Company shut off power to flooded areas as a safety precaution . In Fort Huachuca , power lines were downed , leading to early dismissal of army classes . One person was killed in relation to Raymond after being trapped in a mobile home which was destroyed by high winds . Flash flooding triggered by Raymond caused an estimated $ 1 @.@ 5 million in damage throughout Arizona . 
 = Daylight saving time = 
 Daylight saving time ( DST ) or summer time is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months by one hour so that evening daylight lasts an hour longer , while sacrificing normal sunrise times . Typically , regions with summer time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn to standard time . People use the terms " spring forward " and " fall back " when referring to this . 
 New Zealander George Hudson proposed the idea of daylight saving in 1895 . The German Empire and Austria @-@ Hungary organized the first nationwide implementation , starting on April 30 , 1916 . Many countries have used it at various times since then , particularly since the energy crisis of the 1970s . 
 The practice has both advocates and critics . Putting clocks forward benefits retailing , sports , and other activities that exploit sunlight after working hours , but can cause problems for outdoor entertainment and other activities tied to sunlight , such as farming . Though some early proponents of DST aimed to reduce evening use of incandescent lighting — once a primary use of electricity — today 's heating and cooling usage patterns differ greatly , and research about how DST affects energy use is limited or contradictory . 
 DST clock shifts sometimes complicate timekeeping , and can disrupt travel , billing , record keeping , medical devices , heavy equipment , and sleep patterns . Computer software often adjusts clocks automatically , but policy changes by various jurisdictions of DST dates and timings may be confusing . 
 = = Rationale = = 
 Industrialized societies generally follow a clock @-@ based schedule for daily activities that do not change throughout the course of the year . The time of day that individuals begin and end work or school , and the coordination of mass transit , for example , usually remain constant year @-@ round . In contrast , an agrarian society 's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time , which change seasonally because of the Earth 's axial tilt . North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter , the effect becoming greater as one moves away from the tropics . 
 By synchronously resetting all clocks in a region to one hour ahead of standard time ( one hour " fast " ) , individuals who follow such a year @-@ round schedule will wake an hour earlier than they would have otherwise ; they will begin and complete daily work routines an hour earlier , and they will have available to them an extra hour of daylight after their workday activities . However , they will have one less hour of daylight at the start of each day , making the policy less practical during winter . 
 While the times of sunrise and sunset change at roughly equal rates as the seasons change , proponents of Daylight Saving Time argue that most people prefer a greater increase in daylight hours after the typical " nine to five " workday . Supporters have also argued that DST decreases energy consumption by reducing the need for lighting and heating , but the actual effect on overall energy use is heavily disputed . 
 The manipulation of time at higher latitudes ( for example Iceland , Nunavut or Alaska ) has little impact on daily life , because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons ( in comparison to other latitudes ) , and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock . DST is also of little use for locations near the equator , because these regions see only a small variation in daylight in the course of the year . The effect also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone , with locations further east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations further west in the same time zone . 
 = = History = = 
 Although they did not fix their schedules to the clock in the modern sense , ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does , often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime , so that each daylight hour was longer during summer . For example , Roman water clocks had different scales for different months of the year : at Rome 's latitude the third hour from sunrise , hora <unk> , started by modern standards at 09 : 02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice , but at the summer solstice it started at 06 : 58 and lasted 75 minutes ( see also : Roman timekeeping ) . After ancient times , equal @-@ length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal , so civil time no longer varies by season . Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings , such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies . 
 During his time as an American envoy to France , Benjamin Franklin , publisher of the old English proverb , " Early to bed , and early to rise , makes a man healthy , wealthy and wise " , anonymously published a letter suggesting that Parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight . This 1784 satire proposed taxing window shutters , rationing candles , and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise . Despite common misconception , Franklin did not actually propose DST ; 18th @-@ century Europe did not even keep precise schedules . However , this soon changed as rail transport and communication networks came to require a standardization of time unknown in Franklin 's day . 
 Modern DST was first proposed by the New Zealand entomologist George Hudson , whose shift work job gave him leisure time to collect insects , and led him to value after @-@ hours daylight . In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two @-@ hour daylight @-@ saving shift , and after considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch , he followed up in an 1898 paper . Many publications credit DST 's proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett , who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre @-@ breakfast ride , when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through a large part of a summer 's day . An avid golfer , he also disliked cutting short his round at dusk . His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months , a proposal he published two years later . The proposal was taken up by the Liberal Member of Parliament ( MP ) Robert Pearce , who introduced the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on February 12 , 1908 . A select committee was set up to examine the issue , but Pearce 's bill did not become law , and several other bills failed in the following years . Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915 . 
 William Sword Frost , mayor of Orillia , Ontario , introduced daylight saving time in the municipality during his tenure from 1911 to 1912 . 
 Starting on April 30 , 1916 , the German Empire and its World War I ally Austria @-@ Hungary were the first to use DST ( German : Sommerzeit ) as a way to conserve coal during wartime . Britain , most of its allies , and many European neutrals soon followed suit . Russia and a few other countries waited until the next year and the United States adopted it in 1918 . 
 Broadly speaking , Daylight Saving Time was abandoned in the years after the war ( with some notable exceptions including Canada , the UK , France , and Ireland ) . However , it was brought back for periods of time in many different places during the following decades , and commonly during World War II . It became widely adopted , particularly in North America and Europe , starting in the 1970s as a result of the 1970s energy crisis . 
 Since then , the world has seen many enactments , adjustments , and repeals . For specific details , an overview is available at daylight saving time by country . 
 = = Procedure = = 
 In the case of the United States where a one @-@ hour shift occurs at 02 : 00 local time , in spring the clock jumps forward from the last moment of 01 : 59 standard time to 03 : 00 DST and that day has 23 hours , whereas in autumn the clock jumps backward from the last moment of 01 : 59 DST to 01 : 00 standard time , repeating that hour , and that day has 25 hours . A digital display of local time does not read 02 : 00 exactly at the shift to summer time , but instead jumps from 01 : 59 : 59 @.@ 9 forward to 03 : 00 : 00 @.@ 0 . 
 Clock shifts are usually scheduled near a weekend midnight to lessen disruption to weekday schedules . A one @-@ hour shift is customary . Twenty @-@ minute and two @-@ hour shifts have been used in the past . 
 Coordination strategies differ when adjacent time zones shift clocks . The European Union shifts all at once , at 01 : 00 UTC or 02 : 00 CET or 03 : 00 <unk> ; for example , Eastern European Time is always one hour ahead of Central European Time . Most of North America shifts at 02 : 00 local time , so its zones do not shift at the same time ; for example , Mountain Time is temporarily ( for one hour ) zero hours ahead of Pacific Time , instead of one hour ahead , in the autumn and two hours , instead of one , ahead of Pacific Time in the spring . In the past , Australian districts went even further and did not always agree on start and end dates ; for example , in 2008 most DST @-@ observing areas shifted clocks forward on October 5 but Western Australia shifted on October 26 . In some cases only part of a country shifts ; for example , in the US , Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe DST . 
 Start and end dates vary with location and year . Since 1996 , European Summer Time has been observed from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October ; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union . Starting in 2007 , most of the United States and Canada observe DST from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November , almost two @-@ thirds of the year . The 2007 US change was part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ; previously , from 1987 through 2006 , the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October , and Congress retains the right to go back to the previous dates now that an energy @-@ consumption study has been done . Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the change — to provide extra daylight on October 31 . 
 Beginning and ending dates are roughly the reverse in the southern hemisphere . For example , mainland Chile observed DST from the second Saturday in October to the second Saturday in March , with transitions at 24 : 00 local time . The time difference between the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could therefore be five hours during the Northern summer , three hours during the Southern summer and four hours a few weeks per year because of mismatch of changing dates . 
 DST is generally not observed near the equator , where sunrise times do not vary enough to justify it . Some countries observe it only in some regions ; for example , southern Brazil observes it while equatorial Brazil does not . Only a minority of the world 's population uses DST because Asia and Africa generally do not observe it . 
 = = Politics = = 
 Daylight saving has caused controversy since it began . Winston Churchill argued that it enlarges " the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people who live in this country " and pundits have dubbed it " Daylight <unk> Time " . Historically , retailing , sports , and tourism interests have favored daylight saving , while agricultural and evening entertainment interests have opposed it , and its initial adoption had been prompted by energy crisis and war . 
 The fate of Willett 's 1907 proposal illustrates several political issues involved . The proposal attracted many supporters , including Arthur Balfour , Churchill , David Lloyd George , Ramsay MacDonald , Edward VII ( who used half @-@ hour DST at Sandringham or " Sandringham time " ) , the managing director of Harrods , and the manager of the National Bank . However , the opposition was stronger : it included Prime Minister H. H. Asquith , Christie ( the Astronomer Royal ) , George Darwin , Napier Shaw ( director of the Meteorological Office ) , many agricultural organizations , and theatre owners . After many hearings the proposal was narrowly defeated in a Parliament committee vote in 1909 . Willett 's allies introduced similar bills every year from 1911 through 1914 , to no avail . The US was even more skeptical : Andrew Peters introduced a DST bill to the United States House of Representatives in May 1909 , but it soon died in committee . 
 After Germany led the way with starting DST ( German : Sommerzeit ) during World War I on April 30 , 1916 together with its allies to alleviate hardships from wartime coal shortages and air raid blackouts , the political equation changed in other countries ; the United Kingdom used DST first on May 21 , 1916 . US retailing and manufacturing interests led by Pittsburgh industrialist Robert Garland soon began lobbying for DST , but were opposed by railroads . The US 's 1917 entry to the war overcame objections , and DST was established in 1918 . 
 The war 's end swung the pendulum back . Farmers continued to dislike DST , and many countries repealed it after the war . Britain was an exception : it retained DST nationwide but over the years adjusted transition dates for several reasons , including special rules during the 1920s and 1930s to avoid clock shifts on Easter mornings . The US was more typical : Congress repealed DST after 1919 . President Woodrow Wilson , like Willett an avid golfer , vetoed the repeal twice but his second veto was overridden . Only a few US cities retained DST locally thereafter , including New York so that its financial exchanges could maintain an hour of arbitrage trading with London , and Chicago and Cleveland to keep pace with New York . Wilson 's successor Warren G. Harding opposed DST as a " deception " . Reasoning that people should instead get up and go to work earlier in the summer , he ordered District of Columbia federal employees to start work at 08 : 00 rather than 09 : 00 during summer 1922 . Some businesses followed suit though many others did not ; the experiment was not repeated . 
 Since Germany 's adoption in 1916 , the world has seen many enactments , adjustments , and repeals of DST , with similar politics involved . 
 The history of time in the United States includes DST during both world wars , but no standardization of peacetime DST until 1966 . In May 1965 , for two weeks , St. Paul , Minnesota and Minneapolis , Minnesota were on different times , when the capital city decided to join most of the nation by starting Daylight Saving Time while Minneapolis opted to follow the later date set by state law . In the mid @-@ 1980s , Clorox ( parent of Kingsford Charcoal ) and 7 @-@ Eleven provided the primary funding for the Daylight Saving Time Coalition behind the 1987 extension to US DST , and both Idaho senators voted for it based on the premise that during DST fast @-@ food restaurants sell more French fries , which are made from Idaho potatoes . 
 In 1992 , after a three @-@ year trial of daylight saving in Queensland , Australia , a referendum on daylight saving was held and defeated with a 54 @.@ 5 % ' no ' vote – with regional and rural areas strongly opposed , while those in the metropolitan south @-@ east were in favor . In 2005 , the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association and the National Association of Convenience Stores successfully lobbied for the 2007 extension to US DST . In December 2008 , the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland ( DS4SEQ ) political party was officially registered in Queensland , advocating the implementation of a dual @-@ time zone arrangement for Daylight Saving in South East Queensland while the rest of the state maintains standard time . DS4SEQ contested the March 2009 Queensland State election with 32 candidates and received one percent of the statewide primary vote , equating to around 2 @.@ 5 % across the 32 electorates contested . After a three @-@ year trial , more than 55 % of Western Australians voted against DST in 2009 , with rural areas strongly opposed . On April 14 , 2010 , after being approached by the DS4SEQ political party , Queensland Independent member Peter Wellington , introduced the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland Referendum Bill 2010 into Queensland Parliament , calling for a referendum at the next State election on the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland under a dual @-@ time zone arrangement . The Bill was defeated in Queensland Parliament on June 15 , 2011 . 
 In the UK the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents supports a proposal to observe SDST 's additional hour year @-@ round , but is opposed in some industries , such as postal workers and farmers , and particularly by those living in the northern regions of the UK . 
 In some Muslim countries DST is temporarily abandoned during Ramadan ( the month when no food should be eaten between sunrise and sunset ) , since the DST would delay the evening dinner . Ramadan took place in July and August in 2012 . This concerns at least Morocco and Palestine , although Iran keeps DST during Ramadan . Most Muslim countries do not use DST , partially for this reason . 
 The 2011 declaration by Russia that it would not turn its clocks back and stay in DST all year long was subsequently followed by a similar declaration from Belarus . Russia 's plan generated widespread complaints due to the dark of wintertime morning , and thus was abandoned in 2014 . The country changed its clocks to Standard Time on October 26 , 2014 and intends to stay there permanently . 
 = = Dispute over benefits and drawbacks = = 
 Proponents of DST generally argue that it saves energy , promotes outdoor leisure activity in the evening ( in summer ) , and is therefore good for physical and psychological health , reduces traffic accidents , reduces crime , or is good for business . Groups that tend to support DST are urban workers , retail businesses , outdoor sports enthusiasts and businesses , tourism operators , and others who benefit from increased light during the evening in summer . 
 Opponents argue that actual energy savings are inconclusive , that DST increases health risks such as heart attack , that DST can disrupt morning activities , and that the act of changing clocks twice a year is economically and socially disruptive and cancels out any benefit . Farmers have tended to oppose DST . 
 Common agreement about the day 's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule has generally been chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier . The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight . DST is commonly not observed during most of winter , because its mornings are darker ; workers may have no sunlit leisure time , and children may need to leave for school in the dark . Since DST is applied to many varying communities , its effects may be very different depending on their culture , light levels , geography , and climate ; that is why it is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice . Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits . 
 = = = Energy use = = = 
 DST 's potential to save energy comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting , which consumes about 3 @.@ 5 % of electricity in the United States and Canada . Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning . As Franklin 's 1784 satire pointed out , lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase , as in high @-@ latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise . An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting , once a primary use of electricity . Although energy conservation remains an important goal , energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then , and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results . Electricity use is greatly affected by geography , climate , and economics , making it hard to generalize from single studies . 
 The United States Department of Transportation ( DOT ) concluded in 1975 that DST might reduce the country 's electricity usage by 1 % during March and April , but the National Bureau of Standards ( NBS ) reviewed the DOT study in 1976 and found no significant savings . 
 In 2000 when parts of Australia began DST in late winter , overall electricity consumption did not decrease , but the morning peak load and prices increased . 
 In Western Australia during summer 2006 – 2007 , DST increased electricity consumption during hotter days and decreased it during cooler days , with consumption rising 0 @.@ 6 % overall . 
 Although a 2007 study estimated that introducing DST to Japan would reduce household lighting energy consumption , a 2007 simulation estimated that DST would increase overall energy use in Osaka residences by 0 @.@ 13 % , with a 0 @.@ 02 % decrease due to less lighting more than outweighed by a 0 @.@ 15 % increase due to extra cooling ; neither study examined non @-@ residential energy use . This is probably because DST 's effect on lighting energy use is mainly noticeable in residences . 
 A 2007 study found that the earlier start to DST that year had little or no effect on electricity consumption in California . 
 A 2007 study estimated that winter daylight saving would prevent a 2 % increase in average daily electricity consumption in Great Britain . This paper was revised in October 2009 . 
 A 2008 study examined billing data in Indiana before and after it adopted DST in 2006 , and concluded that DST increased overall residential electricity consumption by 1 % to 4 % , due mostly to extra afternoon cooling and extra morning heating ; the main increases came in the fall . A study estimated the overall annual cost of DST to Indiana households $ 9 million , with an additional $ 1 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 5 million for social costs due to increased pollution . 
 The United States Department of Energy ( DOE ) concluded in a 2008 report that the 2007 United States extension of DST saved 0 @.@ 5 % of electricity usage during the extended period . This report analyzed only the extension , not the full eight months of DST , and did not examine the use of heating fuels . 
 Several studies have suggested that DST increases motor fuel consumption . The 2008 DOE report found no significant increase in motor gasoline consumption due to the 2007 United States extension of DST . 
 = = = Economic effects = = = 
 Retailers , sporting goods makers , and other businesses benefit from extra afternoon sunlight , as it induces customers to shop and to participate in outdoor afternoon sports . In 1984 , Fortune magazine estimated that a seven @-@ week extension of DST would yield an additional $ 30 million for 7 @-@ Eleven stores , and the National Golf Foundation estimated the extension would increase golf industry revenues $ 200 million to $ 300 million . A 1999 study estimated that DST increases the revenue of the European Union 's leisure sector by about 3 % . 
 Conversely , DST can adversely affect farmers , parents of young children , and others whose hours are set by the sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice , although some farmers are neutral . One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates , so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable . Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change . Their cows are sensitive to the timing of milking , so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems . Today some farmers ' groups are in favor of DST . 
 DST also hurts prime @-@ time television broadcast ratings , drive @-@ ins and other theaters . 
 Changing clocks and DST rules has a direct economic cost , entailing extra work to support remote meetings , computer applications and the like . For example , a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion , and Utah State University economist William F. <unk> II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around $ 1 @.@ 7 billion USD . Although it has been argued that clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency , and that in 2000 the daylight @-@ saving effect implied an estimated one @-@ day loss of $ 31 billion on US stock exchanges , the estimated numbers depend on the methodology . The results have been disputed , and the original authors have refuted the points raised by <unk> . 
 = = = Public safety = = = 
 In 1975 the US DOT conservatively identified a 0 @.@ 7 % reduction in traffic fatalities during DST , and estimated the real reduction at 1 @.@ 5 % to 2 % , but the 1976 NBS review of the DOT study found no differences in traffic fatalities . In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1 @.@ 2 % , including a 5 % reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians . Others have found similar reductions . Single / Double Summer Time ( SDST ) , a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer , has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3 % to 4 % in the UK , compared to ordinary DST . However , accidents do increase by as much as 11 % during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time . It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts . A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden . If this effect exists , it is far smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities . A 2009 US study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST , workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less , and are injured at work more often and more severely . 
 In the 1970s the US Law Enforcement Assistance Administration ( <unk> ) found a reduction of 10 % to 13 % in Washington , D.C. ' s violent crime rate during DST . However , the <unk> did not filter out other factors , and it examined only two cities and found crime reductions only in one and only in some crime categories ; the DOT decided it was " impossible to conclude with any confidence that comparable benefits would be found nationwide " . Outdoor lighting has a marginal and sometimes even contradictory influence on crime and fear of crime . 
 In several countries , fire safety officials encourage citizens to use the two annual clock shifts as reminders to replace batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors , particularly in autumn , just before the heating and candle season causes an increase in home fires . Similar twice @-@ yearly tasks include reviewing and practicing fire escape and family disaster plans , inspecting vehicle lights , checking storage areas for hazardous materials , reprogramming thermostats , and seasonal vaccinations . Locations without DST can instead use the first days of spring and autumn as reminders .

 DST has mixed effects on health . In societies with fixed work schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise . It alters sunlight exposure ; whether this is beneficial depends on one 's location and daily schedule , as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin , but overexposure can lead to skin cancer . DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier , but some argue the reverse . The <unk> <unk> Foundation Fighting Blindness , chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund , successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for US DST extensions . 
 Clock shifts were found to increase the risk of heart attack by 10 percent , and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency . Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks . A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise in the weeks after the spring transition , the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season . A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition , and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition . The government of Kazakhstan cited health complications due to clock shifts as a reason for abolishing DST in 2005 . In March 2011 , Dmitri Medvedev , president of Russia , claimed that " stress of changing clocks " was the motivation for Russia to stay in DST all year long . Officials at the time talked about an annual increase in suicides . 
 An unexpected adverse effect of daylight saving time may lie in the fact that an extra part of morning rush hour traffic occurs before dawn and traffic emissions then cause higher air pollution than during daylight hours . 
 = = = Complexity = = = 
 DST 's clock shifts have the obvious disadvantage of complexity . People must remember to change their clocks ; this can be time @-@ consuming , particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely . People who work across time zone boundaries need to keep track of multiple DST rules , as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way . The length of the calendar day becomes variable ; it is no longer always 24 hours . Disruption to meetings , travel , broadcasts , billing systems , and records management is common , and can be expensive . During an autumn transition from 02 : 00 to 01 : 00 , a clock reads times from 01 : 00 : 00 through 01 : 59 : 59 twice , possibly leading to confusion . 
 Damage to a German steel facility occurred during a DST transition in 1993 , when a computer timing system linked to a radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration , resulting in <unk> of molten steel when it was poured . Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients , without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care . These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change ; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs , and users must install updates and restart applications . Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules , or manually adjust the devices ' clocks . A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) rather than the local time zone . For example , Unix @-@ based computer systems use the UTC @-@ based Unix time internally . 
 Some clock @-@ shift problems could be avoided by adjusting clocks continuously or at least more gradually — for example , Willett at first suggested weekly 20 @-@ minute transitions — but this would add complexity and has never been implemented . 
 DST inherits and can magnify the disadvantages of standard time . For example , when reading a sundial , one must compensate for it along with time zone and natural discrepancies . Also , sun @-@ exposure guidelines such as avoiding the sun within two hours of noon become less accurate when DST is in effect . 
 = = Terminology = = 
 As explained by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the ( American ) National Council of Teachers of English , the form daylight savings time ( with an " s " ) was already in 1978 much more common than the older form daylight saving time in American English ( " the change has been virtually accomplished " ) . Nevertheless , even dictionaries such as Merriam @-@ Webster 's , American Heritage , and Oxford , which describe actual usage instead of prescribing outdated usage ( and therefore also list the newer form ) , still list the older form first . This is because the older form is still very common in print and preferred by many editors . ( " Although daylight saving time is considered correct , daylight savings time ( with an " s " ) is commonly used . " ) The first two words are sometimes hyphenated ( daylight @-@ saving [ s ] time ) . Merriam @-@ Webster 's also lists the forms daylight saving ( without " time " ) , daylight savings ( without " time " ) , and daylight time . 
 In Britain , Willett 's 1907 proposal used the term daylight saving , but by 1911 the term summer time replaced daylight saving time in draft legislation . Continental Europe uses similar phrases , such as Sommerzeit in Germany , <unk> in Dutch @-@ speaking regions , <unk> in Finland , <unk> de <unk> or hora de <unk> in Spain and <unk> d 'été in France , whereas in Italy the term is ora <unk> , that is , legal time ( legally enforced time ) as opposed to " ora solare " , solar time , in winter . 
 The name of local time typically changes when DST is observed . American English replaces standard with daylight : for example , Pacific Standard Time ( PST ) becomes Pacific Daylight Time ( PDT ) . In the United Kingdom , the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is British Summer Time ( BST ) , and British English typically inserts summer into other time zone names , e.g. Central European Time ( CET ) becomes Central European Summer Time ( CEST ) . 
 The North American mnemonic " spring forward , fall back " ( also " spring ahead ... " , " spring up ... " , and " ... fall behind " ) helps people remember which direction to shift clocks . 
 = = Computing = = 
 Changes to DST rules cause problems in existing computer installations . For example , the 2007 change to DST rules in North America required that many computer systems be upgraded , with the greatest impact on e @-@ mail and calendar programs . The upgrades required a significant effort by corporate information technologists . 
 Some applications standardize on UTC to avoid problems with clock shifts and time zone differences . Likewise , most modern operating systems internally handle and store all times as UTC and only convert to local time for display . 
 However , even if UTC is used internally , the systems still require information on time zones to correctly calculate local time where it is needed . Many systems in use today base their date / time calculations from data derived from the IANA time zone database also known as zoneinfo . 
 = = = IANA time zone database = = = 
 The IANA time zone database maps a name to the named location 's historical and predicted clock shifts . This database is used by many computer software systems , including most Unix @-@ like operating systems , Java , and the Oracle RDBMS ; HP 's " <unk> " database is similar but incompatible . When temporal authorities change DST rules , zoneinfo updates are installed as part of ordinary system maintenance . In Unix @-@ like systems the TZ environment variable specifies the location name , as in TZ = ' : America / New _ York ' . In many of those systems there is also a system @-@ wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set : this setting is controlled by the contents of the / etc / <unk> file , which is usually a symbolic link or hard link to one of the zoneinfo files . Internal time is stored in timezone @-@ independent epoch time ; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display . 
 Older or stripped @-@ down systems may support only the TZ values required by POSIX , which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value . For example , TZ = ' <unk> , <unk> / 02 : 00 , <unk> / 02 : 00 ' specifies time for the eastern United States starting in 2007 . Such a TZ value must be changed whenever DST rules change , and the new value applies to all years , mishandling some older <unk> . 
 = = = Microsoft Windows = = = 
 As with zoneinfo , a user of Microsoft Windows configures DST by specifying the name of a location , and the operating system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change . Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release . Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows . Windows Vista supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting . In a Canadian location observing DST , a single Vista setting supports both 1987 – 2006 and post @-@ 2006 time stamps , but <unk> some older time stamps . Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone , so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post @-@ 2006 time stamps . 
 These limitations have caused problems . For example , before 2005 , DST in Israel varied each year and was skipped some years . Windows 95 used rules correct for 1995 only , causing problems in later years . In Windows 98 , Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST , forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year . The 2005 Israeli Daylight Saving Law established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules ' dates in a year @-@ independent way . Partial workarounds , which mishandled older time stamps , included manually switching zone files every year and a Microsoft tool that switches zones automatically . In 2013 , Israel standardized its daylight saving time according to the Gregorian calendar . 
 Microsoft Windows keeps the system real @-@ time clock in local time . This causes several problems , including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems that set the clock to UTC , and double @-@ adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions , such as with a rescue boot disk . This approach is a problem even in Windows @-@ only systems : there is no support for per @-@ user timezone settings , only a single system @-@ wide setting . In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry <unk> that had been introduced many years earlier , when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks , but had not been maintained . Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft . 
 The NTFS file system used by recent versions of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp , but displays it corrected to local — or seasonal — time . However , the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time . Consequently , when a file is copied from the hard disk onto separate media , its time will be set to the current local time . If the time adjustment is changed , the <unk> of the original file and the copy will be different . The same effect can be observed when compressing and <unk> files with some file <unk> . It is the NTFS file that changes seen time . This effect should be kept in mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another , although there are other methods of comparing files for equality ( such as using a <unk> algorithm ) . 
 = = Permanent daylight saving time = = 
 A move to " permanent daylight saving time " ( staying on summer hours all year with no time shifts ) is sometimes advocated , and has in fact been implemented in some jurisdictions such as Argentina , Chile , Iceland , Singapore , Uzbekistan and Belarus . Advocates cite the same advantages as normal DST without the problems associated with the twice yearly time shifts . However , many remain unconvinced of the benefits , citing the same problems and the relatively late sunrises , particularly in winter , that year @-@ round DST entails . Russia switched to permanent DST from 2011 to 2014 , but the move proved unpopular because of the late sunrises in winter , so the country switched permanently back to " standard " or " winter " time in 2014 . 
 Xinjiang , China ; Argentina ; Chile ; Iceland ; Russia and other areas skew time zones westward , in effect observing DST year @-@ round without complications from clock shifts . For example , Saskatoon , Saskatchewan , is at 106 ° 39 ′ W longitude , slightly west of center of the idealized Mountain Time Zone ( 105 ° W ) , but the time in Saskatchewan is Central Standard Time ( 90 ° W ) year @-@ round , so Saskatoon is always about 67 minutes ahead of mean solar time , thus effectively observing daylight saving time year @-@ round . Conversely , northeast India and a few other areas skew time zones eastward , in effect observing negative DST . The United Kingdom and Ireland experimented with year @-@ round DST from 1968 to 1971 but abandoned it because of its unpopularity , particularly in northern regions . 
 Western France , Spain , and other areas skew time zones and shift clocks , in effect observing DST in winter with an extra hour in summer . Nome , Alaska , is at 165 ° 24 ′ W longitude , which is just west of center of the idealized Samoa Time Zone ( 165 ° W ) , but Nome observes Alaska Time ( 135 ° W ) with DST , so it is slightly more than two hours ahead of the sun in winter and three in summer . Double daylight saving time has been used on occasion ; for example , it was used in some European countries during and shortly after World War II when it was referred to as " Double Summer Time " . See British Double Summer Time and Central European Midsummer Time for details .

 Jennifer Lynn Connelly ( born December 12 , 1970 ) is an American film actress who began her career as a child model . She appeared in magazine , newspaper and television advertising , before she made her debut role in the 1984 crime film Once Upon a Time in America . Connelly continued modeling and acting , starring in films such as the 1986 film Labyrinth and the 1991 films Career Opportunities and The Rocketeer . She gained critical acclaim for her work in the 1998 science fiction film Dark City and for her portrayal of Marion Silver in the 2000 drama Requiem for a Dream . 
 In 2002 , Connelly won an Academy Award , a Golden Globe Award and a BAFTA Award for her supporting role as Alicia Nash in Ron Howard 's 2001 biopic A Beautiful Mind . Her later credits include the 2003 Marvel superhero film Hulk where she played Bruce Banner 's true love Betty Ross , the 2005 horror film Dark Water , the 2006 drama Blood Diamond , the 2008 science fiction remake The Day the Earth Stood Still , the 2009 romantic comedy He 's Just Not That into You and the 2009 biographical drama Creation . She re @-@ teamed with her Requiem for a Dream director Darren Aronofsky and A Beautiful Mind co @-@ star Russell Crowe for the 2014 biblical epic Noah . 
 Connelly was named Amnesty International Ambassador for Human Rights Education in 2005 . She has been the face of Balenciaga fashion advertisements , as well as for Revlon cosmetics . In 2012 , she was named the first global face of the Shiseido Company . Magazines including Time , Vanity Fair and Esquire , as well as the Los Angeles Times newspaper have included her on their lists of the world 's most beautiful women .

 Connelly was born in Cairo , New York , in the Catskill Mountains . She is the daughter of Ilene , an antiques dealer , and Gerard Karl Connelly ( 1941 – 2008 ) , a clothing manufacturer . Her father was Roman Catholic of Irish and Norwegian descent . Her mother was Jewish and was educated at a yeshiva ; Ilene 's family had emigrated from Poland and Russia . Connelly was raised primarily in Brooklyn Heights , near the Brooklyn Bridge , where she attended Saint Ann 's , a private school specializing in the Arts . Her father suffered from asthma , so the family moved to Woodstock , New York , in 1976 to escape the city smog . Four years later , the family returned to Brooklyn Heights , and Connelly returned to Saint Ann 's .

 When Connelly was 10 years old , an advertising executive friend of her father suggested she audition as a model . Her parents sent a picture of her to the Ford Modeling Agency , which shortly after added her to its roster . Connelly began modeling for print advertisements before moving on to television commercials . In an interview with The Guardian , she revealed that , after having done some modeling , she had no aspirations to become an actor . She appeared on the cover of several issues of Seventeen in 1986 and 1988 . In December 1986 , she recorded two pop songs for the Japanese market : " Monologue of Love " and " Message of Love " . Connelly sang in phonetic Japanese as she did not speak the language . 
 Her mother started taking her to acting auditions . At once , Connelly was selected for a supporting role as the aspiring dancer and actress Deborah Gelly in Sergio Leone 's 1984 gangster epic Once Upon a Time in America . The role required performing a ballet routine . During the audition , Connelly , who had no ballet training , tried to imitate a ballerina . Her performance , and the similarity of her nose to Elizabeth McGovern 's , who played the character as an adult , convinced the director to cast her . Connelly described the movie as " an incredibly idyllic introduction to movie @-@ making " . While Once Upon a Time in America was being filmed , Connelly made her first television appearance , in the episode " Stranger in Town " of the British series Tales of the Unexpected . 
 Her first leading role was in Italian giallo @-@ director Dario Argento 's 1985 film Phenomena , as a girl who uses her psychic powers to communicate with insects , in order to pursue the serial killer of students of the Swiss school where she has just enrolled . She next had the lead in the coming @-@ of @-@ age movie Seven Minutes in Heaven , released the same year . 
 Of her early career , she said , " Before I knew it , [ acting ] became what I did . It was a very peculiar way to grow up , combined with my personality . " She described feeling like " a kind of walking puppet " through her adolescence , without having time alone to deal with the attention her career was generating .

 Connelly gained public recognition with Jim Henson 's 1986 film Labyrinth with David Bowie , in which she played Sarah , a teenager on a quest to rescue her brother Toby from the world of goblins . Although a disappointment at the box office , the film later became a cult classic . The New York Times , while noting the importance of her part , panned her portrayal : " Jennifer Connelly as Sarah is unfortunately disappointing . ... She looks right , but she lacks conviction and seems to be reading rehearsed lines that are recited without belief in her goal or real need to accomplish it . " Two years later , she starred as a ballet student in the Italian film Étoile , and portrayed college student Gabby in Michael Hoffman 's Some Girls . 
 Balancing work and school , she studied English for two years at Yale University in 1988 and 1989 , before transferring to Stanford University in 1990 to study drama . There , she trained with Roy London , Howard Fine and Harold <unk> . Encouraged by her parents to continue with her film career , Connelly left college and returned to the movie industry the same year . 
 In 1990 , Dennis Hopper directed The Hot Spot , in which Connelly played Gloria Harper , a woman being blackmailed . The film was a box office failure but Connelly was praised . Stephen Schaefer wrote for USA Today , " Anyone looking for proof that little girls do grow up fast in the movies should take a gander at curvaceous Jennifer Connelly [ ... ] in The Hot Spot . Not yet 20 , Connelly has neatly managed the transition from child actress to ingenue " . During an interview with Shaeffer , Connelly commented on her first nude scene : " The nudity was hard for me and something I thought about ... but it 's not in a sleazy context " . The same year , director Garry Marshall considered her for the role of Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman , but ultimately felt that she was too young for the part . 
 Connelly 's next film was the 1991 romantic comedy Career Opportunities , starring alongside Frank Whaley . People magazine criticized the film for exploiting Connelly 's body . The marketing included a life @-@ size cardboard cutout showing Whaley watching Connelly ride a mechanical horse , with the caption " He 's about to have the ride of his life " . In an interview with Rolling Stone , Connelly said that a Yale professor brought it to her attention and " ... that wasn 't something I felt all that comfortable about " . 
 The big @-@ budget Disney film The Rocketeer ( 1991 ) followed later that year , but failed to ignite her career . She played Jenny Blake , the aspiring actress girlfriend of stunt pilot Cliff , " the Rocketeer " . New York characterized the movie as " pallid " . The review said of her performance , " Connelly is properly cast ; she has the moist , full @-@ to @-@ the @-@ cheek bones sensuality of the Hollywood starlets of that period , but she 's a little straight " . She appeared alongside Jason Priestley in the Roy Orbison music video for " I Drove All Night " the following year . 
 Connelly next appeared in Of Love and Shadows , a 1994 Argentine @-@ American drama film written and directed by Betty Kaplan starring Antonio Banderas . In 1995 , director John Singleton cast Connelly as a lesbian college student in Higher Learning . She next appeared in the 1996 independent film Far Harbor as Elie , a prominent person in a Hollywood studio who writes a screenplay based on her traumas . 
 It was followed that year by the neo @-@ noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls , which featured the murder of Allison Pond ( Connelly ) , mistress of General Timms ( John Malkovich ) , and the investigation by a group of detectives led by Maxwell Hoover ( Nick Nolte ) . New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond : " This footage is actually dirty . That is , it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it , but it 's so <unk> erotic that we can hardly look away " . About nudity in the movie , Connelly said : " It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie , because I had always been so careful about nudity , it was very much a part of this character and I couldn 't be coy or guarded or self @-@ <unk> it wouldn 't work . It was sort of a challenge I wanted to take on , I guess " . 
 She began to appear in small @-@ budget films which did well with critics , such as 1997 's drama Inventing the Abbotts , set in the late 1950s , in which she played the part of Eleanor , one of three daughters of the town millionaire , Lloyd Abbott . About her performance , director Ron Howard said , " She not only was beautiful and seductive but gave some difficult psychological moments in the film a lot of depth and complexity . She had an extraordinary combination of talent and beauty , and I guess I stored that information in the back of my brain " . 
 Her next appearance was in the critically acclaimed 1998 science fiction film Dark City , where she played alongside Rufus Sewell , William Hurt , Ian Richardson and Kiefer Sutherland . Connelly portrayed femme fatale Emma , a torch singer whose husband , John Murdoch ( Rufus Sewell ) , suffers from amnesia . As Murdoch is regaining his memories , Emma is kidnapped by Mr. Hand ( Richard O 'Brien ) and The Strangers , who alter her memories and assign her a new identity . Author Sean McMullen wrote , " Jennifer Connelly is visually splendid as the 1940s femme fatale ( Emma ) . "

 In 2001 , Ed Harris directed Connelly in the biopic Pollock in which she played Ruth <unk> , Jackson Pollock 's mistress . In 2000 she appeared in what critics considered her breakthrough film , Requiem for a Dream , directed by Darren Aronofsky and based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby , Jr . Connelly played Marion Silver , the girlfriend of Harry , played by Jared Leto ; the movie also starred Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn . Her character is a middle @-@ class girl from Manhattan Beach who pursues the dream of establishing a dress shop . She becomes addicted to heroin and descends into a life of prostitution . Connelly prepared for the role by renting an apartment in the building where the character lived . During her time in the apartment , Connelly isolated herself , painted , listened to music that she considered that her character would , designed clothes , and used the time to reflect about addictions and their origin . Connelly also talked to addicts and attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings with a friend who was in recovery . Critics acclaimed the individual performances for the actors ' emotional courage in portraying physical and mental degradation . Connelly said she became interested in the script for its depiction of the addictions and their effects on the lives and affections of the characters and their relatives . 
 The critic Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times , 
 " Ms. Connelly , too , whittled herself down to a new weight class , and it 's her performance that gives the movie weight , since her fall is the most precipitous . By the end , when she curls into a happy fetal ball with a furtive smile on her face , she has come to love her debasement .... Her dank realization is more disturbing than anything in the novel , and Ms. Connelly has never before done anything to prepare us for how good she is here . " 
 During 2000 , she appeared as Catherine Miller in the FOX drama series The $ treet , about a brokerage house in New York . 
 Also in 2000 , she appeared in Waking the Dead , a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name , playing Sarah Williams , an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees ( Strangely , Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly 's character in Labyrinth ) . Initially , director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress . Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly 's performance in Far Harbor . Gordon later said : " There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship than I ever could have hoped for . " About her role , Connelly said , " Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt like my own thing . I was really trying to make something of the part and threw myself into it , so that meant a lot to me " . The New York Times described her performance , " As Sarah , Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and <unk> that are very much of the period . And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor . " 
 The script of Ron Howard 's 2001 film A Beautiful Mind , loosely based on Sylvia Nasar 's 1998 biography of the mathematician John Nash , sparked her interest in the project . Connelly was invited to an audition after her agent Risa Shapiro sent the producers a tape with a clip of the yet unreleased Requiem for a Dream . She was cast by the film 's producer , Brian Grazer , as Alicia Nash , the caring and enduring wife of the brilliant , schizophrenic mathematician , played by Russell Crowe . Howard and the producers eventually chose them after being particularly impressed by their screen chemistry . The film was a critical and commercial success , grossing more than US $ 313 million worldwide . Connelly had the chance to meet the real Alicia Nash before starting shooting and learned more about her life . For her portrayal , Connelly earned a Golden Globe , an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress , and a BAFTA for Best Actress in a Supporting Role . Time magazine critic Richard Schickel called her performance " luminous " and the actress intelligent and passionate . Roger Ebert wrote , " ... Jennifer Connelly is luminous as Alicia . Although the showier performance belongs to Crowe , it is Connelly 's complex work , depicting a woman torn by love for and fear of the same man , that elevates the film to a higher level " . 
 Connelly said afterward , " [ A Beautiful Mind ] is the film I 'm really proud of and really love . " A.O. Scott of The New York Times said , " There is , for one thing , Ms. Connelly , keen and spirited in the underwritten role of a woman who starts out as a math groupie and soon finds herself the <unk> of a disturbed , difficult man . " 
 In relation to previous roles , Connelly said : 
 " There was a period where I felt like I wasn 't quite being considered for the projects that I wanted to work on because maybe people were thinking . ' I 'm not going to cast the girl who was in that movie for this adult project . ' I 've felt for a long time that this is what I want to do so I 'm happy at this point to just take my time and work on projects that I feel really strongly about and the rest of the time just live my life . " 
 Connelly said that she became interested in Ang Lee 's Hulk ( 2003 ) because of his philosophical perspective on the Marvel Comics superhero . She played Betty Ross , a scientist and the former girlfriend of the main character , Bruce Banner . The film was a moderate success . 
 It was followed the same year by House of Sand and Fog , a drama based on the novel by Andre <unk> III . She portrayed Kathy Nicolo , an abandoned wife whose inherited house is sold at auction to the Iranian emigre and former colonel Massoud Amir <unk> ( Ben Kingsley ) . After reading the script , Connelly said : " ( the story is ) moving and beautifully written . I liked the fact that there is no good guy and bad guy . I found it really compelling that both sides do things that are morally questionable , because life is often like that . " Producer Michael London said about Connelly 's portrayal : " I think she understood Kathy and knew in her bones that she could take this character and give her the kind of dimension that she had . I don 't think there is another actress who could have played Kathy with such power and grace . " The film received worldwide critical acclaim , with a BBC reporter commenting , " [ Connelly ] convinces totally as a selfish , desperate and lonely woman who confesses to her brother , ' I just feel lost ' " .

 After a two @-@ year absence from the film scene , Connelly returned in the 2005 horror / psychological thriller Dark Water , which was based on a 2002 Japanese film of the same name . She played Dahlia , a frightened young woman traumatized by her past , who moves with her daughter to an apartment in New York City where paranormal happenings take place . In his review , critic Roger Ebert wrote , " I cared about the Jennifer Connelly character ; she is not a horror heroine but an actress playing a mother faced with horror . There is a difference , and because of that difference , Dark Water works " . 
 She played Kathy Adamson in an adaptation of the novel Little Children alongside Kate Winslet , a movie which focuses on the relationship between Sarah Pierce ( played by Winslet ) and Brad Adamson ( Patrick Wilson ) . Connelly co @-@ starred in Blood Diamond opposite Leonardo DiCaprio where she portrayed journalist Maddy Bowen , who is working on exposing the real story behind blood diamonds . New York praised her performance : " Connelly is such a smart , sane , <unk> actress that she almost disguises the fact that her character is a wheeze . " Both Little Children and Blood Diamond were nominated for multiple Academy Awards . 
 Her next appearance was as Grace in the drama Reservation Road with Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo , a film released in 2007 . After her son dies in a hit @-@ and @-@ run , Grace gradually tries to overcome her grief , while her husband Ethan ( Joaquin Phoenix ) becomes obsessed with discovering who killed him . By her own account , the character she played in the movie proved tougher than any of her previous roles . USA Today 's Susan Wloszczyna commented , " The strong performances of Jennifer Connelly and Mark Ruffalo ... raise the film above overheated melodrama " . 
 Parisian fashion house Balenciaga and Revlon cosmetics signed Connelly as the face of their 2008 campaigns . Connelly portrayed astrobiologist Helen Benson alongside Keanu Reeves in the 2008 remake of the 1951 science fiction film The Day The Earth Stood Still . Unlike the original movie , in which Benson was a secretary and her relationship with Klaatu was the focus , the remake featured Benson in a troubled relationship with her stepson , portrayed by Jaden Smith . This was followed by a role in the 2009 romantic comedy He 's Just Not That Into You , which also featured Jennifer Aniston and Ginnifer Goodwin . The film was based on the self @-@ help book of the same name . Variety praised her portrayal : " Despite its layer of darkness Connelly gives a really rich performance as a woman whose principles back her into a corner " . 
 In 2009 , she appeared in the costume drama biopic Creation , in which she played Emma Darwin , wife of Charles Darwin , opposite her real @-@ life husband Paul Bettany . Set during the writing of On the Origin of Species , the movie depicts Darwin 's struggle with the subject of the book as well as with his wife , who opposed his theories , and their mourning for their daughter Annie . The San Francisco Chronicle wrote , " Darwin 's wife , a religious woman who disapproved of her husband 's theories , is played by Jennifer Connelly , Bettany 's real @-@ life wife , in the kind of casting that doesn 't always work , but it does here . We believe in the Darwins ' history together , their familiarity and affection . Connelly 's English accent is also as good as Renée Zellweger 's and Gwyneth Paltrow 's . She doesn 't get just the sounds right , but also the music and the attitude " . She then voiced the character named " 7 " , an adventurous warrior in the animated film 9 . 
 Dustin Lance Black 's Virginia premiered on September 15 , 2010 , at the Toronto International Film Festival . Two years later , it was announced that the movie would receive a limited theatrical release in May 2012 . Connelly portrayed the title role of Virginia , a mentally unstable woman who has a 20 @-@ year affair with the local sheriff , whose daughter then starts a relationship with Virginia 's son . Connelly prepared for the role by watching documentaries on schizophrenia . She also spent time at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the New York University 's Cancer Center to understand the <unk> and obstacles of her character . While she was preparing for the role , director Dustin Lance Black requested Connelly 's advice to design the set of Virginia 's house , as well as the selection of the apparel to create the character 's style . 
 She described the film as a " very different " and " very personal " independent film . According to Cinema Blend , " Virginia is propped up by a strong central performance , with Connelly doing some of her best work in years " . 
 In 2011 , Connelly starred in Ron Howard 's comedy The Dilemma with Vince Vaughn . Although the Austin Chronicle 's review noted , " Vaughn nails it , and his nicely nuanced <unk> performance is aided by the always @-@ excellent Connelly , " the movie opened to generally negative reviews . Variety remarked , " Connelly , though a shade looser and more spontaneous than usual , seems stuck at an emotional remove from the action " . Her next project , George Ratliff 's Salvation Boulevard , premiered during the 2011 Sundance Film Festival . In the film Connelly played Gwen , the wife of Carl <unk> ( Greg Kinnear ) ; the couple are members of the Church of the Third Millennium , led by pastor Dan ( Pierce Brosnan ) . During the same year , Connelly recorded an audiobook version of Paul Bowles ' The Sheltering Sky , which integrates the A @-@ List Collection of Audible.com , released in March 2012 . 
 Her next project , starred alongside Greg Kinnear was the family drama Stuck in Love , the directorial debut of Josh Boone . Connelly played the ex @-@ wife of Kinnear 's character , with whom he is obsessed . The film was premiered during the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival . 
 In February 2012 , Connelly was announced as the first global brand ambassador for Shiseido , having previously worked with the company in the 1980s in a series of advertisements for the Japanese market . On August 2013 , it was announced that Connelly was cast by her husband , Paul Bettany , for his directorial debut Shelter . Connelly had a role in the 2014 film adaptation of the 1983 Mark Helprin novel , Winter 's Tale , the directorial debut of Akiva Goldsman , alongside Colin Farrell and William Hurt ; As well as starring in the English @-@ speaking directorial debut of Claudia Llosa Cry / Fly . 
 Working again in collaboration with A Beautiful Mind co @-@ star Russell Crowe , she portrayed <unk> in Darren Aronofsky 's 2014 biblical epic Noah . The film opened to favorable reviews . The Washington Post declared Connelly and Crowe 's performances " impressively grounded , powerful " ; The Denver Post felt that Connelly portrayed the role with " fine intelligence " . Variety deemed her appearance " solid but underused " , while Detroit News stated " Connelly has too little to do , but when she lets go , she hits hard . " Indiewire wrote that Connelly conveyed the role with a " steady hand " , while St. Paul Pioneer Press defined her interpretation as " compelling " .

 = 1918 flu pandemic = 
 The 1918 flu pandemic ( January 1918 – December 1920 ) was an unusually deadly influenza pandemic , the first of the two pandemics involving H1N1 influenza virus . It infected 500 million people across the world , including remote Pacific islands and the Arctic , and resulted in the deaths of 50 to 100 million ( three to five percent of the world 's population ) , making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history . 
 Disease had already greatly limited life expectancy in the early twentieth century . A considerable spike occurred at the time of the pandemic , specifically the year 1918 . Life expectancy dropped by about 12 years . 
 Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill juvenile , elderly , or already weakened patients ; in contrast , the 1918 pandemic predominantly killed previously healthy young adults . Modern research , using virus taken from the bodies of frozen victims , has concluded that the virus kills through a cytokine storm ( overreaction of the body 's immune system ) . The strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body , whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle @-@ aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups . 
 Historical and epidemiological data are inadequate to identify the pandemic 's geographic origin . It was implicated in the outbreak of encephalitis lethargica in the 1920s . 
 To maintain morale , wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany , Britain , France , and the United States ; but papers were free to report the epidemic 's effects in neutral Spain ( such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII ) , creating a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit — thus the pandemic 's nickname Spanish flu . In Spain , a different nickname was adopted , the Naples Soldier ( Soldado de Nápoles ) , which came from a musical operetta ( zarzuela ) titled La canción del olvido ( The Song of Forgetting ) , which premiered in Madrid during the first epidemic wave . Federico Romero , one of the librettists , quipped that the play 's most popular musical number , Naples Soldier , was as catchy as the flu . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Hypotheses about source = = = 
 Investigative work by a British team led by virologist John Oxford of St Bartholomew 's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital identified a major troop staging and hospital camp in Étaples , France , as almost certainly being the center of the 1918 flu pandemic . A significant precursor virus , harbored in birds , mutated to pigs that were kept near the front . 
 Earlier hypotheses of the epidemic 's origin have varied . Some hypothesized the flu originated in East Asia . Dr. C. <unk> , leading expert of the 1918 flu for the Institut Pasteur , asserted the former virus was likely to have come from China , mutating in the United States near Boston and spreading to Brest , France , Europe 's battlefields , Europe , and the world using Allied soldiers and sailors as main spreaders . He considered several other hypotheses of origin , such as Spain , Kansas , and Brest , as being possible , but not likely . Historian Alfred W. Crosby speculated the flu originated in Kansas . Popular writer John Barry echoed Crosby in describing Haskell County , Kansas , as the likely point of origin . 
 Political scientist Andrew Price @-@ Smith published data from the Austrian archives suggesting the influenza had earlier origins , beginning in Austria in the spring of 1917 . 
 Historian Mark Humphries of Canada 's Memorial University of Newfoundland states that newly unearthed records confirm that one of the side stories of the war , the mobilization of 96 @,@ 000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I 's western front , may have been the source of the pandemic . In the new report , Humphries finds archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu . 
 A scientific investigation published in 2016 found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers . In fact , there is evidence that the virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic . 
 = = = Spread = = = 
 When an infected person sneezes or coughs more than half a million virus particles can be spread to those close by . The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation ; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus . Some speculate the soldiers ' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment , as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks , increasing their susceptibility . 
 A large factor in the worldwide occurrence of this flu was increased travel . Modern transportation systems made it easier for soldiers , sailors , and civilian travelers to spread the disease . 
 In the United States , the disease was first observed in Haskell County , Kansas , in January 1918 , prompting local doctor Loring Miner to warn the U.S. Public Health Service 's academic journal . On 4 March 1918 , company cook Albert <unk> reported sick at Fort Riley , Kansas . By noon on 11 March 1918 , over 100 soldiers were in the hospital . Within days , 522 men at the camp had reported sick . By 11 March 1918 the virus had reached Queens , New York . Failure to take preventative measures in March / April was later criticised . 
 In August 1918 , a more virulent strain appeared simultaneously in Brest , France ; in Freetown , Sierra Leone ; and in the U.S. in Boston , Massachusetts . The Allies of World War I came to call it the Spanish flu , primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918 . Spain was not involved in the war and had not imposed wartime censorship . 
 = = Mortality = = 
 = = = Around the globe = = = 
 The global mortality rate from the 1918 / 1919 pandemic is not known , but an estimated 10 % to 20 % of those who were infected died . With about a third of the world population infected , this case @-@ fatality ratio means 3 % to 6 % of the entire global population died . Influenza may have killed as many as 25 million people in its first 25 weeks . Older estimates say it killed 40 – 50 million people , while current estimates say 50 @-@ 100 million people worldwide were killed . 
 This pandemic has been described as " the greatest medical holocaust in history " and may have killed more people than the Black Death . It is said that this flu killed more people in 24 weeks than AIDS has killed in 24 years , more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century . 
 The disease killed in every corner of the globe . As many as 17 million died in India , about 5 % of the population . The death toll in India 's British @-@ ruled districts alone was 13 @.@ 88 million . 
 In Japan , of the 23 million people who were affected , 390 @,@ 000 died . In the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) , 1 @.@ 5 million were assumed to have died among 30 million inhabitants . In Tahiti 13 % of the population died during only a month . Similarly , in Samoa 22 % of the population of 38 @,@ 000 died within two months . 
 In the U.S. about 28 % of the population suffered , and 500 @,@ 000 to 675 @,@ 000 died . Native American tribes were particularly hard hit . In the Four Corners area alone , 3 @,@ 293 deaths were registered among Native Americans . Entire village communities perished in Alaska . In Canada 50 @,@ 000 died . In Brazil 300 @,@ 000 died , including president Rodrigues Alves . In Britain , as many as 250 @,@ 000 died ; in France , more than 400 @,@ 000 . In West Africa an influenza epidemic killed at least 100 @,@ 000 people in Ghana . Tafari <unk> ( the future Haile Selassie , Emperor of Ethiopia ) was one of the first Ethiopians who contracted influenza but survived , although many of his family 's subjects did not ; estimates for the fatalities in the capital city , Addis Ababa , range from 5 @,@ 000 to 10 @,@ 000 , or higher . In British Somaliland one official estimated that 7 % of the native population died . 
 This huge death toll was caused by an extremely high infection rate of up to 50 % and the extreme severity of the symptoms , suspected to be caused by cytokine storms . Symptoms in 1918 were so unusual that initially influenza was misdiagnosed as dengue , cholera , or typhoid . One observer wrote , " One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from mucous membranes , especially from the nose , stomach , and intestine . Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also occurred " . The majority of deaths were from bacterial pneumonia , a secondary infection caused by influenza , but the virus also killed people directly , by causing massive hemorrhages and edema in the lung . 
 The unusually severe disease killed up to 20 % of those infected , as opposed to the usual flu epidemic mortality rate of 0 @.@ 1 % . 
 = = = Patterns of fatality = = = 
 An unusual feature of this pandemic was that it mostly killed young adults . In 1918 – 1919 , 99 % of pandemic influenza deaths in the US occurred in people under 65 , and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40 years old . In 1920 the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased six @-@ fold to half the mortality rate of people over 65 , but still 92 % of deaths occurred in people under 65 . This is noteworthy , since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals , such as infants ( under age two ) , the very old ( over age 70 ) , and the immunocompromised . In 1918 , older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889 – 1890 flu pandemic , known as the Russian flu . According to historian John M. Barry , the most vulnerable of all – " those most likely , of the most likely " , to die – were pregnant women . He reported that in thirteen studies of hospitalized women in the pandemic , the death rate ranged from 23 % to 71 % . Of the pregnant women who survived childbirth , over one @-@ quarter ( 26 % ) lost the child . 
 Another oddity was that the outbreak was widespread in the summer and autumn ( in the Northern Hemisphere ) ; influenza is usually worse in winter . 
 Modern analysis has shown the virus to be particularly deadly because it triggers a cytokine storm , which ravages the stronger immune system of young adults . 
 In fast @-@ progressing cases , mortality was primarily from pneumonia , by virus @-@ induced pulmonary consolidation . Slower @-@ progressing cases featured secondary bacterial pneumonias , and there may have been neural involvement that led to mental disorders in some cases . Some deaths resulted from malnourishment . 
 A study conducted by He et al. used a mechanistic modelling approach to study the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic . They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns , and the patterns of mortality and morbidity . Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values . 
 Another study by He et al. used a simple epidemic model , to incorporate three factors including : school opening and closing , temperature changes over the course of the outbreak , and human behavioral changes in response to the outbreak to infer the cause of the three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic . Their modelling results showed that all three factors are important but human behavioral responses showed the largest effects . 
 = = = Deadly second wave = = = 
 The second wave of the 1918 pandemic was much deadlier than the first . The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics ; those most at risk were the sick and elderly , while younger , healthier people recovered easily . But in August , when the second wave began in France , Sierra Leone and the United States , the virus had mutated to a much deadlier form . 
 This increased severity has been attributed to the circumstances of the First World War . In civilian life , natural selection favours a mild strain . Those who get very ill stay home , and those mildly ill continue with their lives , preferentially spreading the mild strain . In the trenches , natural selection was reversed . Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were , while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals , spreading the deadlier virus . The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again . Consequently , during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval ( looking for deadlier strains of the virus ) . 
 The fact that most of those who recovered from first @-@ wave infections were now immune showed that it must have been the same strain of flu . This was most dramatically illustrated in Copenhagen , which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0 @.@ 29 % ( 0 @.@ 02 % in the first wave and 0 @.@ 27 % in the second wave ) because of exposure to the less @-@ lethal first wave . On the rest of the population it was far more deadly now ; the most vulnerable people were those like the soldiers in the trenches – young previously healthy adults . 
 = = = Devastated communities = = = 
 Even in areas where mortality was low , so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered . Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside . There were reports that the health @-@ care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill . Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places . 
 Several Pacific island territories were particularly hard @-@ hit . The pandemic reached them from New Zealand , which was too slow to implement measures to prevent ships carrying the flu from leaving its ports . From New Zealand , the flu reached Tonga ( killing 8 % of the population ) , Nauru ( 16 % ) and Fiji ( 5 % , 9 @,@ 000 people ) . 
 Worst affected was German Samoa , today the independent state of Samoa , which had been occupied by New Zealand in 1914 . A crippling 90 % of the population was infected ; 30 % of adult men , 22 % of adult women and 10 % of children died . By contrast , the flu was kept away from American Samoa when Governor John Martin Poyer imposed a blockade . In New Zealand itself , 8 @,@ 573 deaths were attributed to the 1918 pandemic influenza , resulting in a total population fatality rate of 0 @.@ 74 % . 
 = = = Less @-@ affected areas = = = 
 In Japan , 257 @,@ 363 deaths were attributed to influenza by July 1919 , giving an estimated 0 @.@ 425 % mortality rate , much lower than nearly all other Asian countries for which data are available . The Japanese government severely restricted maritime travel to and from the home islands when the pandemic struck . 
 In the Pacific , American Samoa and the French colony of New Caledonia also succeeded in preventing even a single death from influenza through effective quarantines . In Australia , nearly 12 @,@ 000 perished .
