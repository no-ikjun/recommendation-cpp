 When the first periodic table of the elements was published by Dmitri Mendeleev in the early 1870s , it showed a " — " in place after uranium similar to several other places for then @-@ undiscovered elements . Other subsequent tables of known elements , including a 1913 publication of the known radioactive isotopes by Kasimir Fajans , also show an empty place after uranium . 
 Up to and after the discovery of the final component of the atomic nucleus , the neutron in 1932 , most scientists did not seriously consider the possibility of elements heavier than uranium . While nuclear theory at the time did not explicitly prohibit their existence , there was little evidence to suggest that they did . However , the discovery of induced radioactivity by Irène and Frédéric Joliot @-@ Curie in late 1933 opened up an entirely new method of researching the elements and inspired a small group of Italian scientists led by Enrico Fermi to begin a series of experiments involving neutron bombardment . Although the Joliot @-@ Curies ' experiment involved bombarding a sample of <unk> with alpha particles to produce the radioactive <unk> , Fermi realized that using neutrons , which have no electrical charge , would most likely produce even better results than the positively charged alpha particles . Accordingly , in March 1934 he began systematically subjecting all of the then @-@ known elements to neutron bombardment to determine whether others could also be induced to radioactivity . 
 After several months of work , Fermi 's group had tentatively determined that lighter elements would disperse the energy of the captured neutron by emitting a proton or alpha particle and heavier elements would generally accomplish the same by emitting a gamma ray . This latter behavior would later result in the beta decay of a neutron into a proton , thus moving the resulting isotope one place up the periodic table . When Fermi 's team bombarded uranium , they observed this behavior as well , which strongly suggested that the resulting isotope had an atomic number of 93 . Fermi was initially reluctant to publicize such a claim , but after his team observed several unknown half @-@ lives in the uranium bombardment products that did not match those of any known isotope , he published a paper entitled Possible Production of Elements of Atomic Number Higher than 92 in June 1934 . In it he proposed the name ausonium ( atomic symbol Ao ) for element 93 , after the Greek name Ausonia ( Italy ) . 
 Several theoretical objections to the claims of Fermi 's paper were quickly raised ; in particular , the exact process that took place when an atom captured a neutron was not well understood at the time . This and Fermi 's accidental discovery three months later that nuclear reactions could be induced by slow neutrons cast further doubt in the minds of many scientists , notably Aristid von Grosse and Ida Noddack , that the experiment was creating element 93 . While von Grosse 's claim that Fermi was actually producing protactinium was quickly tested and disproved , Noddack 's proposal that the uranium had been shattered into two or more much smaller fragments was simply ignored by most because existing nuclear theory did not include a way for this to be possible . Fermi and his team maintained that they were in fact synthesizing a new element , but the issue remained unresolved for several years . 
 Although the many different and unknown radioactive half @-@ lives in the experiment 's results showed that several nuclear reactions were occurring , Fermi 's group could not prove that element 93 was being created unless they could isolate it chemically . They and many other scientists attempted to accomplish this , including Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner who were among the best <unk> in the world at the time and supporters of Fermi 's claim , but they all failed . Much later , it was determined that the main reason for this failure was because the predictions of element 93 's chemical properties were based on a periodic table which lacked the actinide series . This arrangement placed protactinium below tantalum , uranium below tungsten , and further suggested that element 93 , at that point referred to as eka @-@ rhenium , should be similar to the group 7 elements , including manganese and rhenium . Thorium , protactinium , and uranium , with their dominant oxidation states of + 4 , + 5 , and + 6 respectively , fooled scientists into thinking they belonged below hafnium , tantalum , and tungsten , rather than below the lanthanide series , which was at the time viewed as a fluke , and whose members all have dominant + 3 states ; neptunium , on the other hand , has a much weaker , more unstable + 7 state , with + 4 and + 5 being the most stable . Upon finding that plutonium and the other transuranic elements also have dominant + 3 and + 4 states , along with the discovery of the f @-@ block , the actinide series was firmly established . 
 While the question of whether Fermi 's experiment had produced element 93 was stalemated , two additional claims of the discovery of the element appeared , although unlike Fermi , they both claimed to have observed it in nature . The first of these claims was by Czech engineer <unk> <unk> in 1934 when he extracted a small amount of material from the wash water of heated pitchblende . He proposed the name <unk> for the element , but after being analyzed it turned out that the sample was a mixture of tungsten and vanadium . The other claim , in 1938 by Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and French chemist Yvette Cauchois , claimed to have discovered the new element via spectroscopy in minerals . They named their element <unk> , but the claim was discounted because the prevailing theory at the time was that if it existed at all , element 93 would not exist naturally . However , as neptunium does in fact occur in nature in trace amounts , as demonstrated when it was found in uranium ore in 1952 , it is possible that Hulubei and Cauchois did in fact observe neptunium . 
 Although by 1938 some scientists , including Niels Bohr , were still reluctant to accept that Fermi had actually produced a new element , he was nevertheless awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in November 1938 " for his demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation , and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons " . A month later , the almost totally unexpected discovery of nuclear fission by Hahn , Meitner , and Otto Frisch put an end to the possibility that Fermi had discovered element 93 because most of the unknown half @-@ lives that had been observed by Fermi 's team were rapidly identified as fission products . 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 As research on nuclear fission progressed in early 1939 , Edwin McMillan at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory of the University of California , Berkeley decided to run an experiment bombarding uranium using the powerful 60 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 52 m ) cyclotron that had recently been built at the university . The purpose was to separate the various fission products produced by the bombardment by exploiting the enormous force that the fragments gain from their mutual electrical repulsion after fissioning . Although he did not discover anything of note from this , McMillan did observe two new beta decay half @-@ lives in the uranium trioxide target itself , which meant that whatever was producing the radioactivity had not violently repelled each other like normal fission products . He quickly realized that one of the half @-@ lives closely matched the known 23 @-@ minute decay period of uranium @-@ 239 , but the other half @-@ life of 2 @.@ 3 days was unknown . McMillan took the results of his experiment to chemist and fellow Berkeley professor Emilio Segrè to attempt to isolate the source of the radioactivity . Both scientists began their work using the prevailing theory that element 93 would have similar chemistry to rhenium , but Segrè rapidly determined that McMillan 's sample was not at all similar to rhenium . Instead , when he reacted it with hydrogen fluoride ( HF ) with a strong oxidizing agent present , it behaved much like members of the rare earths . Since these elements comprise a large percentage of fission products , Segrè and McMillan decided that the half @-@ life must have been simply another fission product , titling the paper " An Unsuccessful Search for Transuranium Elements " . 
 However , as more information about fission became available , the possibility that the fragments of nuclear fission could still have been present in the target became more remote . McMillan and several scientists , including Philip H. Abelson , attempted again to determine what was producing the unknown half @-@ life . In early 1940 , McMillan realized that his 1939 experiment with Segrè had failed to test the chemical reactions of the radioactive source with sufficient rigor . In a new experiment , McMillan tried subjecting the unknown substance to HF in the presence of a reducing agent , something he had not done before . This reaction resulted in the sample precipitating with the HF , an action that definitively ruled out the possibility that the unknown substance was a rare earth . Shortly after this , Abelson , who had received his graduate degree from the university , visited Berkeley for a short vacation and McMillan asked the more able chemist to assist with the separation of the experiment 's results . Abelson very quickly observed that whatever was producing the 2 @.@ 3 @-@ day half @-@ life did not have chemistry like any known element and was actually more similar to uranium than a rare earth . This discovery finally allowed the source to be isolated and later , in 1945 , led to the classification of the actinide series . As a final step , McMillan and Abelson prepared a much larger sample of bombarded uranium that had a prominent 23 @-@ minute half @-@ life from 239U and demonstrated conclusively that the unknown 2 @.@ 3 @-@ day half @-@ life increased in strength in concert with a decrease in the 23 @-@ minute activity through the following reaction : 
 <formula> ( The times are half @-@ lives . ) 
 This proved that the unknown radioactive source originated from the decay of uranium and , coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements , proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered . McMillan and Abelson published their results in a paper entitled Radioactive Element 93 in the Physical Review on May 27 , 1940 . They did not propose a name for the element in the paper , but they soon decided on the name neptunium since Neptune is the next planet beyond Uranus in our solar system . 
 = = = Subsequent developments = = = 
 It was also realized that the beta decay of 239Np must produce an isotope of element 94 ( now called plutonium ) , but the quantities involved in McMillan and Abelson 's original experiment were too small to isolate and identify plutonium along with neptunium . The discovery of plutonium had to wait until the end of 1940 , when Glenn T. Seaborg and his team identified the isotope plutonium @-@ 238 . 
 Neptunium 's unique radioactive characteristics allowed it to be traced as it moved through various compounds in chemical reactions , at first this was the only method available to prove that its chemistry was different from other elements . As the first isotope of neptunium to be discovered has such a short half @-@ life , McMillan and Abelson were unable to prepare a sample that was large enough to perform chemical analysis of the new element using the technology that was then available . However , after the discovery of the long @-@ lived 237Np isotope in 1942 by Glenn Seaborg and Arthur Wahl , forming weighable amounts of neptunium became a realistic endeavor . Early research into the element was somewhat limited because most of the nuclear physicists and chemists in the United States at the time were focused on the massive effort to research the properties of plutonium as part of the Manhattan Project . Research into the element did continue as a minor part of the project and the first bulk sample of neptunium was isolated in 1944 . 
 Much of the research into the properties of neptunium since then has been focused on understanding how to confine it as a portion of nuclear waste . Because it has isotopes with very long half @-@ lives , it is of particular concern in the context of designing confinement facilities that can last for thousands of years . It has found some limited uses as a radioactive tracer and a precursor for various nuclear reactions to produce useful plutonium isotopes . However , most of the neptunium that is produced as a reaction byproduct in nuclear power stations is considered to be a waste product . 
 = = Production = = 
 = = = Synthesis = = = 
 The vast majority of the neptunium that currently exists on Earth was produced in artificial nuclear reactions . Neptunium @-@ 237 is the most commonly synthesized isotope due to it being the only one that both can be created via neutron capture and also has a half @-@ lifelong enough to allow weighable quantities to be easily isolated . As such , it is by far the most common isotope to be utilized in chemical studies of the element . 
 When an 235U atom captures a neutron , it is converted to an excited state of 236U . About 81 % of the excited 236U nuclei undergo fission , but the remainder decay to the ground state of 236U by emitting gamma radiation . Further neutron capture creates 237U which has a half @-@ life of 7 days and thus quickly decays to 237Np through beta decay . During beta decay , the excited 237U emits an electron , while the atomic weak interaction converts a neutron to a proton , thus creating 237Np . 
 <formula> 
 237U is also produced via an ( n , 2n ) reaction with 238U . This only happens with very energetic neutrons . 
 237Np is the product of alpha decay of 241Am , which is produced through neutron irradiation of uranium @-@ 238 . 
 Heavier isotopes of neptunium decay quickly , and lighter isotopes of neptunium cannot be produced by neutron capture , so chemical separation of neptunium from cooled spent nuclear fuel gives nearly pure 237Np . The short @-@ lived heavier isotopes 238Np and 239Np , useful as radioactive tracers , are produced through neutron irradiation of 237Np and 238U respectively , while the longer @-@ lived lighter isotopes 235Np and 236Np are produced through irradiation of 235U with protons and deuterons in a cyclotron . 
 Artificial 237Np metal is usually isolated through a reaction of <unk> with liquid barium or lithium at around 1200 ° C and is most often extracted from spent nuclear fuel rods in kilogram amounts as a by @-@ product in plutonium production . 
 2 NpF3 + 3 Ba → 2 Np + 3 <unk> 
 By weight , neptunium @-@ 237 discharges are about 5 % as great as plutonium discharges and about 0 @.@ 05 % of spent nuclear fuel discharges . However , even this fraction still amounts to more than fifty tons per year globally . 
 = = = Purification methods = = = 
 Recovering uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel for reuse is one of the major processes of the nuclear fuel cycle . As it has a long half @-@ life of just over 2 million years , the alpha emitter 237Np is one of the major isotopes of the minor actinides separated from spent nuclear fuel . Many separation methods have been used to separate out the neptunium , operating on small and large scales . The small @-@ scale purification operations have the goals of preparing pure neptunium as a precursor of metallic neptunium and its compounds , and also to isolate and <unk> neptunium in samples for analysis . 
 Most methods that separate neptunium ions exploit the differing chemical behaviour of the differing oxidation states of neptunium ( from + 3 to + 6 or sometimes even + 7 ) in solution . Among the methods that are or have been used are : solvent extraction ( using various <unk> , usually <unk> β @-@ diketone derivatives , <unk> compounds , and amine compounds ) , chromatography using various ion @-@ exchange or chelating resins , coprecipitation ( possible matrices include <unk> , <unk> , BaSO4 , Fe ( OH ) 3 , and MnO2 ) , electrodeposition , and biotechnological methods . Currently , commercial reprocessing plants use the <unk> process , involving the solvent extraction of uranium and plutonium with tributyl phosphate .

 When it is in an aqueous solution , neptunium can exist in any of its five possible oxidation states ( + 3 to + 7 ) and each of these show a characteristic color . The stability of each oxidation state is strongly dependent on various factors , such as the presence of oxidizing or reducing agents , pH of the solution , presence of coordination complex @-@ forming ligands , and even the concentration of neptunium in the solution . 
 In acidic solutions , the neptunium ( III ) to neptunium ( VII ) ions exist as Np3 + , Np4 + , NpO + 
 2 , NpO2 + 
 2 , and NpO + 
 3 . In basic solutions , they exist as the oxides and hydroxides Np ( OH ) 3 , NpO2 , NpO2OH , NpO2 ( OH ) 2 , and NpO3 − 
 5 . Not as much work has been done to characterize neptunium in basic solutions . Np3 + and Np4 + can easily be reduced and oxidized to each other , as can NpO + 
 2 and NpO2 + 
 2 . 
 Neptunium ( III ) 
 Np ( III ) or Np3 + exists as hydrated complexes in acidic solutions , Np ( H 
 2O ) 3 + n . It is a dark blue @-@ purple and is analogous to its lighter congener , the pink rare earth ion Pm3 + . In the presence of oxygen , it is quickly oxidized to Np ( IV ) unless strong reducing agents are also present . Nevertheless , it is the second @-@ least easily hydrolyzed neptunium ion in water , forming the <unk> + ion . Np3 + is the predominant neptunium ion in solutions of pH 4 – 5 . 
 Neptunium ( IV ) 
 Np ( IV ) or Np4 + is pale yellow @-@ green in acidic solutions , where it exists as hydrated complexes ( Np ( H 
 2O ) 4 + n ) . It is quite unstable to hydrolysis in acidic aqueous solutions at pH 1 and above , forming <unk> + . In basic solutions , Np4 + tends to hydrolyze to form the neutral neptunium ( IV ) hydroxide ( Np ( OH ) 4 ) and neptunium ( IV ) oxide ( NpO2 ) . 
 Neptunium ( V ) 
 Np ( V ) or NpO + 
 2 is green @-@ blue in aqueous solution , in which it behaves as a strong Lewis acid . It is a stable ion and is the most common form of neptunium in aqueous solutions . Unlike its neighboring homologues UO + 
 2 and PuO + 
 2 , NpO + 
 2 does not spontaneously disproportionate except at very low pH and high concentration : 
 2 NpO + 
 2 + 4 H + ⇌ Np4 + + NpO2 + 
 2 + 2 H2O 
 It hydrolyzes in basic solutions to form NpO2OH and NpO 
 2 ( OH ) − 
 2 . 
 Neptunium ( VI ) 
 Np ( VI ) or NpO2 + 
 2 , the neptunyl ion , shows a light pink or reddish color in an acidic solution and yellow @-@ green otherwise . It is a strong Lewis acid and is the main neptunium ion encountered in solutions of pH 3 – 4 . Though stable in acidic solutions , it is quite easily reduced to the Np ( V ) ion , and it is not as stable as the homologous hexavalent ions of its neighbours uranium and plutonium ( the uranyl and <unk> ions ) . It hydrolyzes in basic solutions to form the oxo and <unk> ions NpO2OH + , ( NpO 
 2 ) 
 2 ( OH ) 2 + 
 2 , and ( NpO 
 2 ) 
 3 ( OH ) + 
 5 . 
 Neptunium ( VII ) 
 Np ( VII ) is dark green in a strongly basic solution . Though its chemical formula in basic solution is frequently cited as NpO3 − 
 5 , this is a simplification and the real structure is probably closer to a <unk> species like [ NpO 
 4 ( OH ) 
 2 ] 3 − . Np ( VII ) was first prepared in basic solution in 1967 . In strongly acidic solution , Np ( VII ) is found as NpO + 
 3 ; water quickly reduces this to Np ( VI ) . Its hydrolysis products are uncharacterized . 
 = = = Hydroxides = = = 
 The oxides and hydroxides of neptunium are closely related to its ions . In general , Np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before it on the periodic table such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium . This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases . Thus actinides higher on the periodic table will more readily undergo hydrolysis . 
 Neptunium ( III ) hydroxide is quite stable in acidic solutions and in environments that lack oxygen , but it will rapidly oxidize to the IV state in the presence of air . It is not soluble in water . Np ( IV ) hydroxides exist mainly as the electrically neutral Np ( OH ) 4 and its mild solubility in water is not affected at all by the pH of the solution . This suggests that the other Np ( IV ) hydroxide , Np ( OH ) − 
 5 , does not have a significant presence . 
 Because the Np ( V ) ion NpO + 
 2 is very stable , it can only form a hydroxide in high acidity levels . When placed in a 0 @.@ 1 M sodium perchlorate solution , it does not react significantly for a period of months , although a higher molar concentration of 3 @.@ 0 M will result in it reacting to the solid hydroxide NpO2OH almost immediately . Np ( VI ) hydroxide is more reactive but it is still fairly stable in acidic solutions . It will form the compound NpO3 · H2O in the presence of ozone under various carbon dioxide pressures . Np ( VII ) has not been well @-@ studied and no neutral hydroxides have been reported . It probably exists mostly as [ NpO 
 4 ( OH ) 
 2 ] 3 − .

 Three anhydrous neptunium oxides have been reported , NpO2 , Np2O5 , and <unk> , though some studies have stated that only the first two of these exist , suggesting that claims of <unk> are actually the result of mistaken analysis of Np2O5 . However , as the full extent of the reactions that occur between neptunium and oxygen has yet to be researched , it is not certain which of these claims is accurate . Although neptunium oxides have not been produced with neptunium in oxidations as high as those possible with the adjacent actinide uranium , neptunium oxides are more stable at lower oxidation levels . This behavior is illustrated by the fact that NpO2 can be produced by simply burning neptunium salts of <unk> in air . 
 The greenish @-@ brown NpO2 is very stable over a large range of pressures and temperatures and does not undergo phase transitions at low temperatures . It does show a phase transition from face @-@ centered cubic to orthorhombic at around 33 @-@ <unk> , although it returns to is original phase when pressure is released . It remains stable under oxygen pressures up to 2 @.@ 84 MPa and temperatures up to 400 ° C. Np2O5 is black @-@ brown in color and monoclinic with a lattice size of 418 × 658 × 409 picometres . It is relatively unstable and decomposes to NpO2 and O2 at 420 @-@ 695 ° C. Although Np2O5 was initially subject to several studies that claimed to produce it with mutually contradictory methods , it was eventually prepared successfully by heating neptunium peroxide to 300 @-@ 350 ° C for 2 – 3 hours or by heating it under a layer of water in an <unk> at 180 ° C. 
 Neptunium also forms a large number of oxide compounds with a wide variety of elements , although the neptunate oxides formed with alkali metals and alkaline earth metals have been by far the most studied . Ternary neptunium oxides are generally formed by reacting NpO2 with the oxide of another element or by precipitating from an alkaline solution . <unk> has been prepared by reacting <unk> and NpO2 at 400 ° C for 16 hours or by reacting Li2O2 with NpO3 · H2O at 400 ° C for 16 hours in a quartz tube and flowing oxygen . Alkali neptunate compounds <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are all created by a similar reaction : 
 NpO2 + 3 <unk> → <unk> ( M = K , Cs , Rb ) 
 The oxide compounds <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are formed by reacting Np ( VII ) ( [ NpO 
 4 ( OH ) 
 2 ] 3 − ) with a compound of the alkali metal nitrate and ozone . Additional compounds have been produced by reacting NpO3 and water with solid alkali and alkaline peroxides at temperatures of 400 - 600 ° C for 15 – 30 hours . Some of these include Ba3 ( <unk> ) 2 , <unk> , and <unk> . Also , a considerable number of <unk> neptunium oxides are formed by reacting solid @-@ state NpO2 with various alkali or alkaline earth oxides in an environment of flowing oxygen . Many of the resulting compounds also have an equivalent compound that substitutes uranium for neptunium . Some compounds that have been characterized include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . These can be obtained by heating different combinations of NpO2 and <unk> to various temperature thresholds and further heating will also cause these compounds to exhibit different neptunium allotropes . The lithium neptunate oxides <unk> and <unk> can be obtained with similar reactions of NpO2 and <unk> . 
 A large number of additional alkali and alkaline neptunium oxide compounds such as <unk> and <unk> have been characterized with various production methods . Neptunium has also been observed to bond with oxides of many additional elements in groups 3 through 7 , although these are much less well studied . 
 = = = Halides = = = 
 Although neptunium halide compounds have not been nearly as well studied as its oxides , a fairly large number have been successfully characterized . Of these , neptunium fluorides have been the most extensively researched , largely because of their potential use in separating the element from nuclear waste products . Four binary neptunium fluoride compounds , NpF3 , NpF4 , NpF5 , and NpF6 , have been reported . The first two are fairly stable and were first prepared in 1947 through the following reactions : 
 NpO2 + 1 ⁄ 2 H2 + 3 HF → NpF3 + 2 H2O ( 400 ° C ) 
 NpF3 + 1 ⁄ 2 O2 + HF → NpF4 + 1 ⁄ 2 H2O ( 400 ° C ) 
 Later , NpF4 was obtained directly by heating NpO2 to various temperatures in mixtures of either hydrogen fluoride or pure fluorine gas . NpF5 is much more difficult to create and most known preparation methods involve reacting NpF4 or NpF6 compounds with various other fluoride compounds . NpF5 will decompose into NpF4 and NpF6 when heated to around 320 ° C. 
 NpF6 or neptunium hexafluoride is extremely volatile , as are its adjacent actinide compounds uranium hexafluoride ( UF6 ) and plutonium hexafluoride ( <unk> ) . This volatility has attracted a large amount of interest to the compound in an attempt to devise a simple method for extracting neptunium from spent nuclear power station fuel rods . NpF6 was first prepared in 1943 by reacting NpF3 and gaseous fluorine at very high temperatures and the first bulk quantities were obtained in 1958 by heating NpF4 and dripping pure fluorine on it in a specially prepared apparatus . Additional methods that have successfully produced neptunium hexafluoride include reacting <unk> and <unk> with NpF4 and by reacting several different neptunium oxide and fluoride compounds with anhydrous hydrogen <unk> . 
 Four neptunium oxyfluoride compounds , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; have been reported although none of them have been extensively studied . <unk> is a pinkish solid and can be prepared by reacting NpO3 · H2O and <unk> with pure fluorine at around 330 ° C. <unk> and <unk> can be produced by reacting neptunium oxides with anhydrous hydrogen <unk> at various temperatures . Neptunium also forms a wide variety of fluoride compounds with various elements . Some of these that have been characterized include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 Two neptunium chlorides , <unk> and NpCl4 , have been characterized and although several attempts to create <unk> have been made , they have not been successful . <unk> is created by reducing neptunium dioxide with hydrogen and carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4 ) and NpCl4 by reacting a neptunium oxide with CCl4 at around 500 ° C. Other neptunium chloride compounds have also been reported , including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . Neptunium bromides <unk> and <unk> have also been created ; the latter by reacting aluminium bromide with NpO2 at 350 ° C and the former in an almost identical procedure but with zinc present . The neptunium iodide <unk> has also been prepared by the same method as <unk> . 
 = = = Chalcogenides , pnictides , and carbides = = = 
 Neptunium chalcogen and pnictogen compounds have been well studied primarily as part of research into their electronic and magnetic properties and their interactions in the natural environment . <unk> and carbide compounds have also attracted interest because of their presence in the fuel of several advanced nuclear reactor designs , although the latter group has not had nearly as much research as the former . 
 Chalcogenides 
 A wide variety of neptunium sulfide compounds have been characterized , including the pure sulfide compounds NpS , <unk> , <unk> , Np3S5 , Np2S3 , and <unk> . Of these , Np2S3 , prepared by reacting NpO2 with hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at around 1000 ° C , is the most well @-@ studied and three allotropic forms are known . The α form exists up to around 1230 ° C , the β up to 1530 ° C , and the γ form , which can also exist as <unk> , at higher temperatures . NpS can be created by reacting Np2S3 and neptunium metal at 1600 ° C and Np3S5 can be prepared by the decomposition of Np2S3 at 500 ° C or by reacting sulfur and neptunium hydride at 650 ° C. <unk> is made by heating a mixture of Np3S5 and pure sulfur to 500 ° C. All of the neptunium sulfides except for the β and γ forms of Np2S3 are isostructural with the equivalent uranium sulfide and several , including NpS , α − Np2S3 , and β − Np2S3 are also isostructural with the equivalent plutonium sulfide . The oxysulfides <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> have also been created , although the latter three have not been well studied . <unk> was first prepared in 1985 by vacuum sealing NpO2 , Np3S5 , and pure sulfur in a quartz tube and heating it to 900 ° C for one week . 
 Neptunium selenide compounds that have been reported include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . All of these have only been obtained by heating neptunium hydride and selenium metal to various temperatures in a vacuum for an extended period of time and <unk> is only known to exist in the γ allotrope at relatively high temperatures . Two neptunium <unk> compounds are known , <unk> and <unk> , are formed with similar methods by replacing the neptunium hydride with neptunium dioxide . The known neptunium telluride compounds <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> are formed by similar procedures to the selenides and <unk> is isostructural to the equivalent uranium and plutonium compounds . No neptunium − polonium compounds have been reported . 
 <unk> and carbides 
 Neptunium nitride ( <unk> ) was first prepared in 1953 by reacting neptunium hydride and ammonia gas at around 750 ° C in a quartz capillary tube . Later , it was produced by reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures . It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic nitrogen gas at 1550 ° C. <unk> is isomorphous with uranium mononitride ( UN ) and plutonium mononitride ( <unk> ) and has a melting point of <unk> ° C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa . Two neptunium phosphide compounds have been reported , <unk> and <unk> . The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with phosphine gas at 350 ° C. <unk> can be created by reacting neptunium metal with red phosphorus at 740 ° C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away . The compound is non @-@ reactive with water but will react with nitric acid to produce Np ( IV ) solution . 
 Three neptunium arsenide compounds have been prepared , <unk> , <unk> , and Np3As4 . The first two were first created by heating arsenic and neptunium hydride in a vacuum @-@ sealed tube for about a week . Later , <unk> was also made by confining neptunium metal and arsenic in a vacuum tube , separating them with a quartz membrane , and heating them to just below neptunium 's melting point of 639 ° C , which is slightly higher than the arsenic 's sublimation point of 615 ° C. Np3As4 is prepared by a similar procedure using iodine as a transporting agent . <unk> crystals are brownish gold and Np3As4 is black . The neptunium antimonide compound <unk> was created in 1971 by placing equal quantities of both elements in a vacuum tube , heating them to the melting point of antimony , and then heating it further to 1000 ° C for sixteen days . This procedure also created trace amounts of an additional antimonide compound <unk> . One neptunium @-@ bismuth compound , <unk> , has also been reported . 
 The neptunium carbides <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ( tentative ) have been reported , but have not characterized in detail despite the high importance and utility of actinide carbides as advanced nuclear reactor fuel . <unk> is a non @-@ stoichiometric compound , and could be better labelled as <unk> ( 0 @.@ 82 ≤ x ≤ 0 @.@ 96 ) . It may be obtained from the reaction of neptunium hydride with graphite at 1400 ° C or by heating the constituent elements together in an electric arc furnace using a tungsten electrode . It reacts with excess carbon to form pure <unk> . <unk> is formed from heating NpO2 in a graphite crucible at 2660 – 2800 ° C.

 Hydrides 
 Neptunium reacts with hydrogen in a similar manner to its neighbor plutonium , forming the hydrides <unk> + x ( face @-@ centered cubic ) and <unk> ( hexagonal ) . These are isostructural with the corresponding plutonium hydrides , although unlike <unk> + x , the lattice parameters of <unk> + x become greater as the hydrogen content ( x ) increases . The hydrides require extreme care in handling as they decompose in a vacuum at 300 ° C to form finely divided neptunium metal , which is pyrophoric . 
 <unk> , sulfates , and carbonates 
 Being chemically stable , neptunium phosphates have been investigated for potential use in immobilizing nuclear waste . Neptunium pyrophosphate ( α @-@ <unk> ) , a green solid , has been produced in the reaction between neptunium dioxide and boron phosphate at 1100 ° C , though neptunium ( IV ) phosphate has so far remained elusive . The series of compounds <unk> ( PO4 ) 3 , where M is an alkali metal ( Li , Na , K , Rb , or Cs ) , are all known . Some neptunium sulfates have been characterized , both aqueous and solid and at various oxidation states of neptunium ( IV through VI have been observed ) . Additionally , neptunium carbonates have been investigated to achieve a better understanding of the behavior of neptunium in geological repositories and the environment , where it may come into contact with carbonate and bicarbonate aqueous solutions and form soluble complexes . 
 = = = Organometallic = = = 
 A few organoneptunium compounds are known and chemically characterized , although not as many as for uranium due to neptunium 's scarcity and radioactivity . The most well known organoneptunium compounds are the cyclopentadienyl and <unk> compounds and their derivatives . The trivalent cyclopentadienyl compound Np ( C5H5 ) 3 · THF was obtained in 1972 from reacting Np ( C5H5 ) 3Cl with sodium , although the simpler Np ( C5H5 ) could not be obtained . Tetravalent neptunium cyclopentadienyl , a reddish @-@ brown complex , was synthesized in 1968 by reacting neptunium ( IV ) chloride with potassium cyclopentadienide : 
 NpCl4 + 4 <unk> → Np ( C5H5 ) 4 + 4 KCl 
 It is soluble in benzene and THF , and is less sensitive to oxygen and water than Pu ( C5H5 ) 3 and Am ( C5H5 ) 3 . Other Np ( IV ) cyclopentadienyl compounds are known for many ligands : they have the general formula ( C5H5 ) <unk> , where L represents a ligand . <unk> , Np ( C8H8 ) 2 , was synthesized in 1970 by reacting neptunium ( IV ) chloride with K2 ( C8H8 ) . It is isomorphous to uranocene and <unk> , and they behave chemically identically : all three compounds are insensitive to water or dilute bases but are sensitive to air , reacting quickly to form oxides , and are only slightly soluble in benzene and toluene . Other known neptunium <unk> derivatives include Np ( <unk> ) 2 ( R = ethanol , butanol ) and <unk> ( C8H8 ) · <unk> , which is isostructural to the corresponding plutonium compound . In addition , neptunium <unk> have been prepared , and solvated triiodide complexes of neptunium are a precursor to many organoneptunium and inorganic neptunium compounds . 
 = = = Coordination complexes = = = 
 There is much interest in the coordination chemistry of neptunium , because its five oxidation states all exhibit their own distinctive chemical behavior , and the coordination chemistry of the actinides is heavily influenced by the actinide contraction ( the greater @-@ than @-@ expected decrease in ionic radii across the actinide series , analogous to the lanthanide contraction ) . 
 = = = = Solid state = = = = 
 Few neptunium ( III ) coordination compounds are known , because Np ( III ) is readily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen while in aqueous solution . However , sodium formaldehyde <unk> can reduce Np ( IV ) to Np ( III ) , stabilizing the lower oxidation state and forming various sparingly soluble Np ( III ) coordination complexes , such as Np 
 2 ( C 
 2O

 3 · <unk> , Np

 3 · H2O , and Np

 3 . 
 Many neptunium ( IV ) coordination compounds have been reported , the first one being ( Et 
 4N ) Np ( <unk> ) 
 8 , which is isostructural with the analogous uranium ( IV ) coordination compound . Other Np ( IV ) coordination compounds are known , some involving other metals such as cobalt ( <unk> 
 2F 
 10 · 8H2O , formed at 400 K ) and copper ( <unk> 
 2F 
 10 · 6H2O , formed at 600 K ) . Complex nitrate compounds are also known : the experimenters who produced them in 1986 and 1987 produced single crystals by slow evaporation of the Np ( IV ) solution at ambient temperature in concentrated nitric acid and excess 2 @,@ 2 ′ <unk> . 
 The coordination chemistry of neptunium ( V ) has been extensively researched due to the presence of cation – cation interactions in the solid state , which had been already known for <unk> ions . Some known such compounds include the neptunyl dimer Na 
 4 ( NpO 
 4 ) 
 2C 
 12O 
 12 · 8H2O and neptunium <unk> , both of which form green crystals . 
 Neptunium ( VI ) compounds range from the simple oxalate NpO

 2O 
 4 ( which is unstable , usually becoming Np ( IV ) ) to such complicated compounds as the green ( NH

 <unk>

 3 . Extensive study has been performed on compounds of the form M 
 <unk> 
 2 ( CO 
 3 ) 
 3 , where M represents a monovalent cation and An is either uranium , neptunium , or plutonium . 
 Since 1967 , when neptunium ( VII ) was discovered , some coordination compounds with neptunium in the + 7 oxidation state have been prepared and studied . The first reported such compound was initially characterized as Co ( NH 
 3 ) 
 <unk> 
 5 · nH2O in 1968 , but was suggested in 1973 to actually have the formula [ Co ( NH

 Most neptunium coordination complexes known in solution involve the element in the + 4 , + 5 , and + 6 oxidation states : only a few studies have been done on neptunium ( III ) and ( VII ) coordination complexes . For the former , <unk> + and <unk> + 
 2 ( X 
 = Cl , Br ) were obtained in 1966 in concentrated LiCl and <unk> solutions , respectively : for the latter , 1970 experiments discovered that the NpO3 + 
 2 ion could form sulfate complexes in acidic solutions , such as NpO 
 2SO + 
 4 and NpO 
 2 ( SO 
 4 ) − 
 2 ; these were found to have higher stability constants than the neptunyl ion ( NpO2 + 
 2 ) . A great many complexes for the other neptunium oxidation states are known : the inorganic ligands involved are the halides , iodate , azide , nitride , nitrate , thiocyanate , sulfate , carbonate , chromate , and phosphate . Many organic ligands are known to be able to be used in neptunium coordination complexes : they include acetate , <unk> , <unk> , lactate , oxalate , malonate , <unk> , <unk> , and citrate . 
 Analogously to its neighbours , uranium and plutonium , the order of the neptunium ions in terms of complex formation ability is Np4 + > NpO2 + 
 2 ≥ Np3 + > NpO + 
 2 . ( The relative order of the middle two neptunium ions depends on the ligands and solvents used . ) The stability sequence for Np ( IV ) , Np ( V ) , and Np ( VI ) complexes with monovalent inorganic ligands is F − > H 
 <unk> − 
 4 > SCN − > NO − 
 3 > Cl − > ClO − 
 4 ; the order for divalent inorganic ligands is CO2 − 
 3 > <unk> − 
 4 > SO2 − 
 4 . These follow the strengths of the corresponding acids . The divalent ligands are more strongly complexing than the monovalent ones . NpO + 
 2 can also form the complex ions [ NpO + 
 <unk> + ] ( M = 
 Al , Ga , Sc , In , Fe , Cr , Rh ) in perchloric acid solution : the strength of interaction between the two cations follows the order Fe > In > Sc > Ga > Al . The neptunyl and uranyl ions can also form a complex together .

 An important of use of 237Np is as a precursor in plutonium production , where it is irradiated with neutrons to create 238Pu , an alpha emitter for radioisotope thermal generators for spacecraft and military applications . 237Np will capture a neutron to form 238Np and beta decay with a half @-@ life of just over two days to 238Pu .

 Neptunium is fissionable , and could theoretically be used as fuel in a fast neutron reactor or a nuclear weapon , with a critical mass of around 60 kilograms . In 1992 , the U.S. Department of Energy declassified the statement that neptunium @-@ 237 " can be used for a nuclear explosive device " . It is not believed that an actual weapon has ever been constructed using neptunium . As of 2009 , the world production of neptunium @-@ 237 by commercial power reactors was over 1000 critical masses a year , but to extract the isotope from irradiated fuel elements would be a major industrial undertaking . 
 In September 2002 , researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory briefly created the first known nuclear critical mass using neptunium in combination with shells of enriched uranium ( uranium @-@ 235 ) , discovering that the critical mass of a bare sphere of neptunium @-@ 237 " ranges from kilogram weights in the high fifties to low sixties , " showing that it " is about as good a bomb material as [ uranium @-@ 235 ] .

 Neptunium @-@ 237 is the most mobile actinide in the deep geological repository environment .

 " Michael " is the eleventh episode of the third season of the American musical television series Glee , and the fifty @-@ fifth overall . Written by co @-@ creator Ryan Murphy and directed by Alfonso Gomez @-@ Rejon , the episode aired on Fox in the United States on January 31 , 2012 . It is a special tribute episode to Michael Jackson , and features eight of his songs as a solo artist , and one he sang as part of The Jackson 5 . 
 Reviews were widely varied for the episode : some felt it was the best of the third season to date , and others were quite critical , though the overall mix was somewhat more positive than negative . A number of reviewers noted that tribute episodes have tended to be light on plot , though several felt that this episode had surmounted the usual storyline problems that had plagued past tributes . 
 The episode 's musical performances were viewed more favorably , with many of the nine performances given high praise , including " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " , " Human Nature " , " Smooth Criminal " , and " Scream " , the last of these primarily for Kevin McHale 's dancing . Five of the songs — the first three above plus " Bad " and " Black or White " — charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100 , while the other four were also released as singles but did not chart . 
 Upon its initial airing , this episode was viewed by 9 @.@ 07 million American viewers and received a 3 @.@ 7 / 10 Nielsen rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic . The total viewership was up over 20 % from the previous episode , " Yes / No " .

 Glee club members Mercedes ( Amber Riley ) , Santana ( Naya Rivera ) and Brittany ( Heather Morris ) are disappointed that they missed their chance to sing Michael Jackson 's music at Sectionals , so director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) says that New Directions might include Jackson for the upcoming Regionals competition . Blaine ( Darren Criss ) performs " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " to demonstrate his suggested number . However , he mentions this possibility to Sebastian Smythe ( Grant Gustin ) , the new captain of the Dalton Academy Warblers and a Regionals competitor , and Sebastian later announces that the Warblers , who will be performing first , will also be doing Jackson 's music . New Directions challenges the Warblers for the right to perform Jackson , and they meet in a parking garage at night and compete to " Bad " . At the end of the number , Sebastian throws a slushie at Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) but Blaine interposes himself : he is hit in the face and badly injured . 
 Finn ( Cory Monteith ) asks Rachel ( Lea Michele ) for her answer to his proposal since he has waited the three days she requested , but she is not ready , so he agrees to wait longer . Rachel asks Quinn ( Dianna Agron ) for advice , and Quinn advises her to refuse and leave her past behind . Quinn has done so , and she has been accepted at Yale ; she sings " Never Can Say Goodbye " to former boyfriends Puck ( Mark Salling ) , Finn and Sam ( Chord Overstreet ) , and to the glee club . Sam calls Mercedes to the auditorium and asks her to sing with him — they have never duetted in glee club . She refuses and starts to leave , but he begins " Human Nature " and she joins in . Afterward , they kiss . 
 Blaine 's cornea was deeply scratched in the incident and he needs surgery . The club wants revenge on Sebastian ; Kurt says he should be expelled from Dalton , but Will asks them to let the system handle it . Artie ( Kevin McHale ) refuses : he is fed up with being told it will get better and says it should be better now , and leaves . Despite wanting revenge , Kurt is unwilling to use violence , so Santana goes to Dalton and accuses Sebastian of lying about the composition of the damaging slushie . He challenges her to a duel : the song " Smooth Criminal " . He admits after they finish that he rigged the slushie with rock salt , and hits her with an unadulterated one . Santana secretly recorded the encounter , and plays her evidence to New Directions , who in turn invite the Warblers to their auditorium , show them that they " get " Jackson better by performing " Black or White " , and reveal to the Warblers the proof that Sebastian deliberately tried to injure one of them . 
 Kurt 's father Burt ( Mike O 'Malley ) takes Kurt out of class to hand him his letter from NYADA . Kurt opens it and discovers to his elation he is a finalist for admission ; Burt is overcome with pride . Kurt tells Rachel , only to discover that she has not received any letter from the school ; Rachel dissolves in tears . Finn later sings " I Just Can 't Stop Loving You " to Rachel , and she tells him she loves him and that she accepts his proposal . She ultimately does get a finalist letter from NYADA and tells Kurt , to his joy , but she has not yet told Finn .

 Executive producers Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk had been mentioning since before the second season ended that they were planning another big tribute episode that they had been wanting to do since the first season , but would not reveal the name of the artist . On December 6 , 2011 , the same day that they were airing the " Hold On to Sixteen " episode that featured three Jackson family songs , Murphy announced that they had finally obtained the rights to do a Michael Jackson tribute episode . 
 The episode was written by Murphy and directed by Alfonso Gomez @-@ Rejon , who had most recently directed Asian F. Filming had begun by December 12 , 2011 , and was interrupted by a two @-@ week holiday vacation . Both of the last two shooting days before the vacation began , December 15 and 16 , ran a couple of hours past midnight , with the final night not ending until three in the morning . Filming had not yet completed when the twelfth episode , with guest star Ricky Martin , began filming on January 5 , 2012 , the third day after the holiday vacation ended . The two episodes continued in parallel until the final Michael Jackson number was shot on January 13 , 2012 , over a month after filming began and the same day that the thirteenth episode commenced filming . 
 It had been announced late in the summer that Darren Criss , who plays Blaine Anderson , would be starring on Broadway in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying from January 3 through 22 , 2012 , with rehearsals beginning there a couple of weeks before his debut . At the time , the reports said he would be missing " an episode and a half of Glee " . The final scene filmed before the holiday break was the first song in the episode , for which Criss sang lead , and he filmed several scenes in the episode in those last four days . He is singing lead on the song " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " . Criss spent five weeks in New York City , the last three starring in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying from January 3 through 22 , 2012 . 
 The Dalton Academy Warblers return in this episode , and perform " Bad " with New Directions , which was shot on location in a " parking garage just outside the Paramount Studio gates " . On the previous day , several members of New Directions did their first location shoots in the building used for Dalton Academy . The Warblers shot their own number , " I Want You Back " by The Jackson 5 with Gustin on lead vocal , but the song was omitted from the final cut of the episode . This was the second time in the third season that ten musical performances were shot for an episode but only nine were ultimately included : Rivera 's rendition of " Santa Baby " was cut from the episode two before this one , " Extraordinary Merry Christmas " . " I Want You Back " , like " Santa Baby " before it , was nevertheless released as a single , and on August 3 , 2012 , Murphy released the originally filmed scene including it uploaded to his YouTube page . The Warblers number had already run into difficulties earlier in production : it was originally planned to be Jackson 's " Rock with You " , but there were problems clearing the rights , so " I Want You Back " was selected and filmed instead . Gustin and Rivera performed " Smooth Criminal " with on @-@ screen musical guests 2Cellos , Luka <unk> and Stjepan Hauser , who became famous when their instrument @-@ only two @-@ cello cover of the piece received over three million views on YouTube in its first two weeks . The arrangement used for the performance is based on the 2Cellos version . 
 The remaining six songs that are covered in the episode include " I Just Can 't Stop Loving You " , performed by Michele and Monteith ; The Jackson 5 's " Never Can Say Goodbye " , sung by Agron ; " Ben " sung by Colfer , Michele and Monteith ; " Black or White " featuring Riley , Rivera , Michele , McHale and Colfer ; " Human Nature " sung by Riley and Overstreet ; and the Michael and Janet Jackson song " Scream " , performed by McHale and Harry Shum , Jr . " Human Nature " was originally reported as being part of a mash @-@ up with Nat King Cole 's " Nature Boy " , but the song as performed is the Jackson song alone . All ten songs recorded — the nine in the episode plus " I Want You Back " which was ultimately cut — have been released as singles , available for download . 
 Recurring guest stars in the episode include Kurt 's father Burt Hummel ( O 'Malley ) , glee club members Sam Evans ( Overstreet ) and Rory Flanagan ( Damian McGinty ) , and Dalton Academy Warbler Sebastian Smythe ( Gustin ) .

 The episode was given a widely varied reception by reviewers , ranging from Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone , who called it " season three 's best episode so far " , to BuddyTV 's John Kubicek , who described the episode as " just plain silly and ridiculous " , though the overall mix was somewhat more positive than negative . Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal wrote that " the episode was well paced , well sung and well danced " , though he was unhappy with the concluding number , and Entertainment Weekly 's Joseph Brannigan Lynch said the episode " contained some of this season 's best dramatic and musical performances " . Crystal Bell of HuffPost TV stated that she was " a little underwhelmed " by the episode , which " never quite lived up to the greatness that is Michael Jackson " . IGN 's Robert Canning gave the episode a " great " 8 out of 10 , and characterized it as " more than just a theme episode " in which he was " connecting to characters " that had not " grabbed " him since the first season . 
 MTV 's Kevin P. Sullivan summarized the episode as follows : " When all was said and done , it was another tribute episode , something that can 't be uttered by a Glee fan without a sigh and an eye roll . " Bell noted that tribute episodes usually mean that " all sense of plot continuity " is forgone , but that this one ranked " at the top of all of the other Glee tribute episodes because even though it was absurd at times , at least there was a plot — and it kind of made sense " . Futterman was more complimentary and described it as the " most effortless tribute episode yet " , and Canning wrote that " with songs we know and love and storylines that actually connected and delivered some meaningful and moving moments " it was " more than just a theme episode " . Jen Chaney of The Washington Post , however , thought that it was very much like previous tributes in that it also " featured scattered plot lines engineered to include as many songs by said artists as possible " and also " glorified their respective pop stars ’ images to an absurd degree " . The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff also noted the glorification of Jackson , and noted " every time the show turns into an episode about Michael Jackson , it stops dead in its tracks entirely " . He stated that what was " weird " about the episode was that " what didn ’ t work was the spectacle , while what did work were the smaller , character @-@ based stories " which " provided a spine some of the other spectacle @-@ oriented episodes have lacked " . Futterman was one of many reviewers who took note of a new feature of this tribute episode when she commented on the " initial whiff of product placement and forced timing " related to the " Immortal World Tour " dialogue . Rae Votta of Billboard thought the inclusion a " brilliant bit of marketing synergy " , but TVLine 's Michael Slezak called it " ridiculously unsubtle product @-@ placement " . 
 Although Rachel 's decision to accept Finn 's proposal of marriage was greeted with skepticism , Canning spoke for many when he stated that her " arc in the episode was her best in a while " with " some compelling moments " . He also cited the " fantastically true advice " from Quinn , and VanDerWerff thought the scene " was going along great until the last 10 seconds " of that advice . Bell praised as " believable " the scene where Rachel " breaks down in front of Kurt " , and Slezak said he " loved that scene of Kurt holding his sobbing friend in front of the lockers " . Kurt 's scene with his father was Bell 's " favorite scene " which she said was " an incredibly touching moment between father and son . It was perfect . " Flandez also called Burt " perfect " for " delivering the NYADA envelope to his son " , and The Hollywood Reporter 's Lesley Goldberg described his scene as " another great Burt gem " . 
 Kubicek characterized the fact that Sebastian was not arrested for injuring Blaine as " an absurd plot twist " . He criticized Kurt for withholding the evidence and wrote , " Santana 's plan isn 't vicious or mean , it 's getting justice . Sebastian committed a crime and he should pay for it . " Slezak thought the decision as to whether the police would be given Santana 's evidence should have been Blaine 's to make , and Lynch posited that " a talk with the police " might teach Sebastian " that violent actions have legal consequences " . Chaney was incredulous at Will 's statements to the glee club on the matter , especially , " Unless you have proof that he tampered with the slushie , the police aren ’ t getting involved . " Kubicek called Artie 's anger that led to " Scream " a story arc that " goes nowhere and was just a poorly written excuse to do that song " , but Votta was impressed that " we learn more about Artie 's frustration in this fantasy scene than we have in 3 seasons " . Canning wrote that " as extraneous as the extended " Scream " segment was , the build up to that moment was perfect " . 
 = = = Music and performances = = = 
 The episode 's musical performances were given a better reception than the episode as a whole , though there were some dissenting voices , and not every song was received with the same enthusiasm . Slezak described the episode as " jam @-@ packed with terrific song @-@ and @-@ dance numbers " , and Votta wrote that " the musical numbers themselves were strong , fantastical and poignant to the story " . Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times declared , " The music was good ; the dancing , better . " Chaney wrote that " too many " of the musical numbers were " weak imitations " , which was reflected in her grading : her median grade for the nine numbers was a " C + " , and her highest grade was a single " B + " . 
 The first song was " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " , which Bell said " was a fun homage to Michael Jackson , and it set the tone for the rest of the episode " . Futterman said that Blaine 's " slick showmanship " made him a " natural for lead vocals " , and Slezak called it " the best use of Darren Criss ' voice on Glee in quite some time " and gave it an " A − " . Lynch also gave it an " A − " , and said Criss " captured the excitement and the spunky bravado of the original " . Sullivan was another fan of " the sheer awesomeness of Darren Criss " on the song , and characterized it as " a tribute that 's more respectful than any other in the episode " . Chaney dissented from the general approval ; she gave it a " C + " and wrote that " the number was appropriately big and splashy , but musically , it sounded like all the funk had been drained right out of it " . She described " Bad " similarly as she gave it a " C − " : " this tune also sounded noticeably <unk> " . Sullivan was also unimpressed ; he wrote that the performance let " the world know what ' Bad ' sounds like after it 's drained of every ounce of danger " . Lynch gave it a " B " and wrote that " as silly as a choreographed gang fight between teenagers in a parking lot sounds ( and was ) , the choreography was crisp and the attitude was a lot of fun " . Slezak also praised the fight choreography , and stated that he " got chills " when Santana sang the chorus , and gave the song a " B + " . Futterman noted the " interesting twist " in the song 's arrangement " thanks to the Warblers ' penchant for a cappella " , and said that " Artie and Santana " began their battle for " vocal MVP of the episode " with " Bad " . Votta described the number as " up there with the Dreamgirls performance from earlier this season as one of the strangest and best things Glee has done " . 
 Kevin McHale 's performance as Artie in " Scream " inspired several reviewers , including Kate Stanhope of TV Guide and Bell , to write of their regret that McHale could not dance more often on the show . Reiter called him " a sorely underused Glee resource " and called the number " the best dance moment " of the episode , and Bell declared , " I have one word for this number : Epic . " Flandez called it a " phenomenal job " , and Stanhope cited " killer performances " by McHale on this number and others as evidence that with Artie only a junior " there is life " in New Directions after McKinley 's current seniors graduate . Lynch called the number " awesome " and gave it an " A + " , and Goldberg described it as " a perfect example of what the show looks like when it 's firing on all cylinders " ; both reviewers praised the dancing of both performers . Chaney wrote that the performance " lacked the energy and genuine aggression of the original Michael / Janet Jackson collaboration , although at least Kevin McHale and Harry Shum Jr. got to show off their dance skills " , and gave it a " C " . She felt that " Never Can Say Goodbye " , to which she gave a " B − " , " worked much better than every track that preceded it " because it adapted the song to the show " instead of trying to out @-@ Jackson Jackson " . Lynch called it " a nice summation of her character 's journey , but not vocally impressive enough to justify listening to outside of the episode " and gave it a " B " . Bell described it as a " blah performance " , but Stanhope said it was " sweet and reflective " . Futterman wrote that it was " a tune well @-@ suited for Quinn 's sultry voice and the flipped meaning she gives the lyrics " , and Slezak had a similar take : he gave it an " A " and called it a " remarkably lovely fit " for her voice . 
 Votta and Futterman both said that Sam and Mercedes sounded " great together " on " Human Nature " , and Futterman also complimented their individual voices — " hers restrained and soulful , his rock @-@ tinged and raw " — and summarized , " It 's a crisp , well @-@ executed cover " . Most other reviewers also noted how good their voices sounded together , including Chaney , who gave the song a " B − " , and Bell , who called their harmonies " out @-@ of @-@ this @-@ world amazing " . Lynch and Slezak each praised the tenderness in Riley 's vocals ; Lynch gave the song an " A " , and Slezak an " A − " . " Ben " , however , received far more mixed commentary , and several reviewers felt it was odd to , as Chaney put it , sing a song about a rat " to a guy who isn 't named Ben and was wearing an eye patch " , which Futterman called " a little creepy " and VanDerWerff , more bluntly , " fucking weird " . Despite this , Chaney gave the song a " B " , one of her highest grades of the night , in part because it gave Colfer " an excuse to hit those ' You ’ ve got a friend in me ' high notes " , while Futterman noted that he " does well in the high range " , and praised the verses by Rachel and Finn . Bell , however , called the song " a snooze @-@ fest " , and Slezak was very unhappy with the " interminable rendition " which he graded a " D " . In December 2012 , TV Guide listed the rendition as one of Glee 's worst performances . 
 " Smooth Criminal " was the most highly praised number of the night . Both Slezak and Lynch gave it an " A + " : the former called it " an instant Glee classic " that " had me on the edge of my musical chair from start to finish " , and Lynch wrote , " Santana declared herself the winner , but the actual victors were 2Cellos , the real @-@ life Croatian cellists whose manic intensity stole the scene . " Slezak was similarly impressed by 2Cellos — " this was really a duet between Santana and those amazing black cellos " — and Futterman called them " furiously awesome " and said of the song , " It 's the perfect soundtrack for the show 's slickest villains : Santana wails , Sebastian channels his Chuck Bass and we are sold . " Bell described it as " easily one of the best performances of the night " and added " Santana was flawless " . Chaney dissented from the acclaim with a " D " grade . 
 Slezak described the duet of " I Just Can 't Stop Loving You " as " really pretty " , and Chaney said that " Lea Michele ... sang this Jackson love song in the loveliest possible fashion with Cory Monteith " . Votta wrote that " Finn sounds the best he 's sounded " , and Futterman noted that Finn held " his own against Rachel , vocally " — she liked the fact that it was Finn singing to Rachel instead of the usual other way around and was " grateful to the Glee team for assigning plot @-@ relevant songs " . Lynch felt that the song " seemed to slow down the otherwise wonderfully paced episode " and would have preferred it if they had cut the song and " kept the Warblers ' version of ' I Want You Back ' instead " . He was more enthusiastic about " Black or White " , which he characterized as " musically awesome but dramatically confusing " and graded an " A − " . Futterman said that " Artie once again nails the MJ impression " , and Goldberg declared that the " chorus with Santana leading charge and Artie 's rap " were " spot on " . Bell agreed that the song showed that " Artie is still New Directions ' go @-@ to rapper " , but noted that she did not feel that New Directions had successfully demonstrated that they " knew the true meaning of Michael Jackson " . Chaney was unenthusiastic and gave the song a " C " , while Flandez had more negative opinion than hers : " Sebastian Smythe got our reaction right : a slow @-@ handed clap " .

 = George Mikan = 
 George Lawrence Mikan , Jr . ( June 18 , 1924 – June 1 , 2005 ) , nicknamed Mr. Basketball , was an American professional basketball player for the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League ( NBL ) and the Minneapolis Lakers of the NBL , the Basketball Association of America ( BAA ) and the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . Invariably playing with thick , round spectacles , the 6 ft 10 in ( 2 @.@ 08 m ) , 245 pounds ( 111 kg ) Mikan is seen as one of the pioneers of professional basketball , redefining it as a game of so @-@ called big men with his prolific rebounding , shot blocking , and his talent to shoot over smaller defenders with his ambidextrous hook shot , the result of his namesake Mikan Drill . 
 Mikan had a successful playing career , winning seven NBL , BAA , and NBA championships , an All @-@ Star MVP trophy , and three scoring titles . He was a member of the first four NBA All @-@ Star games , and the first six All @-@ BAA and All @-@ NBA Teams . Mikan was so dominant that he caused several rule changes in the NBA , among them , the introduction of the goaltending rule , the widening of the foul lane — known as the " Mikan Rule " — and the creation of the shot clock . 
 After his playing career , Mikan became one of the founders of the American Basketball Association ( ABA ) , serving as commissioner of the league . He was also vital for the forming of the Minnesota Timberwolves . In his later years , Mikan was involved in a long @-@ standing legal battle against the NBA , fighting to increase the meager pensions for players who had retired before the league became lucrative . In 2005 , Mikan died after a long battle with diabetes . 
 For his feats , Mikan was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959 , made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980 , and was elected one of the NBA 's 50 Greatest Players ever in 1996 . Since April 2001 , a statue of Mikan shooting his trademark hook shot graces the entrance of the Timberwolves ' Target Center . 
 = = Early years = = 
 George Mikan was born in Joliet , Illinois , as an American of Croatian descent . As a boy , he shattered one of his knees so badly that he was kept in bed for a year and a half . In 1938 , Mikan attended the Chicago Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary and originally wanted to be a priest , but then moved back home to finish at Joliet Catholic . Mikan did not seem destined to become an athlete . When Mikan entered Chicago 's DePaul University in 1942 , he stood 6 ' 10 " , weighed 245 pounds , moved awkwardly because of his frame , and wore thick glasses for his near @-@ sightedness . 
 = = DePaul University = = 
 However , Mikan met 28 @-@ year @-@ old rookie DePaul basketball coach Ray Meyer , who saw potential in the bright and intelligent , but also clumsy and shy , freshman . Put into perspective , Meyer 's thoughts were revolutionary , because at the time it was believed that tall players were too awkward to ever play basketball well . In the following months , Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident , aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it . Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively , and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand . This routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill . In addition , Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag , take dancing lessons , and jump rope to make him a complete athlete . 
 From his first National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) college games for DePaul on , Mikan dominated his peers . He intimidated opponents with his size and strength , was unstoppable on offense with his hook shot , and soon established a reputation as one of the hardest and grittiest players in the league , often playing through injuries and punishing opposing centers with hard fouls . In addition , Mikan also surprised the basketball world with his unique ability of goaltending , i.e. jumping so high that he swatted the ball away before it could pass the hoop . In today 's basketball , touching the ball after it reaches its apogee is a violation , but in Mikan 's time it was legal because people thought it was impossible anyone could reach that high . " We would set up a zone defense that had four men around the key and I guarded the basket " , Mikan later recalled his DePaul days . " When the other team took a shot , I 'd just go up and tap it out . " As a consequence , the NCAA and later the NBA , outlawed goaltending . One of the few opposing centers to have any success against Mikan was Bob Kurland , a seven @-@ footer from Oklahoma A & M. 
 Mikan was named the Helms NCAA College Player of the Year twice in 1944 and 1945 and an All @-@ American three times , leading DePaul to the NIT title in 1945 , which was as prestigious as the NCAA tournament at the time . Mikan led the nation in scoring with 23 @.@ 9 points per game in 1944 – 45 and 23 @.@ 1 in 1945 – 46 . When DePaul won the 1945 National Invitation Tournament , Mikan was named Most Valuable Player for scoring 120 points in three games , including 53 points in a 97 – 53 win over Rhode Island , equalling the score of the entire Rhode Island team .

 = = = Chicago American Gears ( 1946 – 47 ) = = = 
 After the end of the 1945 – 46 college season , Mikan signed with the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League , a predecessor of the modern NBA . He played with them for 25 games at the end of the 1946 – 47 NBL season , scoring 16 @.@ 5 points per game as a rookie . Mikan led the Gears to the championship of the World Basketball Tournament , where he was elected Most Valuable Player after scoring 100 points in five games , and also voted into the All @-@ NBL Team . 
 However , before the start of the 1947 – 48 NBL season , Maurice White , the president of the American Gear Company and the owner of the American Gears NBL team , pulled the team out of the league . White planned to create a 24 @-@ team league called the Professional Basketball League of America , in which he owned all the teams and arenas . However , the league folded after just a month , and the players of White 's teams were equally distributed among the 11 remaining NBL franchises . As a consequence , every team had a 9 @.@ 09 % chance of landing Mikan , who ended up on the Minneapolis Lakers , playing for coach John Kundla . 
 = = = Minneapolis Lakers ( 1947 – 56 ) = = = 
 In his first season with the Lakers , Mikan led the league in scoring with 1 @,@ 195 points , becoming the first and only NBL player to score more than 1 @,@ 000 points in an NBL season . He was named league MVP , and the Lakers won the NBL title . 
 The following year , the Lakers and three other NBL franchises jumped to the fledgling Basketball Association of America . Mikan led his new league in scoring , and again set a single @-@ season scoring record . The Lakers defeated the Washington Capitols in the 1949 BAA Finals . 
 In 1949 , the BAA and NBL merged to form the NBA . The new league started the inaugural 1949 – 50 NBA season , featuring 17 teams , with the Lakers in the Central Division . Mikan again was dominant , averaging 27 @.@ 4 points per game and 2 @.@ 9 assists per game and taking another scoring title ; Alex Groza of Indianapolis Olympians was the only other player to break the 20 @-@ point @-@ barrier that year . After comfortably leading his team to an impressive 51 – 17 record and storming through the playoffs , Mikan 's team played the 1950 NBA Finals against the Syracuse Nationals . In Game 1 , the Lakers beat Syracuse on their home court when Lakers reserve guard Bob Harrison hit a 40 @-@ foot buzzer beater to give Minneapolis a two @-@ point win . The team split the next four games , and in Game 6 , the Lakers won 110 – 95 and won the first @-@ ever NBA championship . Mikan scored 31 @.@ 3 points per game in the playoffs . 
 In the 1950 – 51 NBA season , Mikan was dominant again , scoring a career @-@ best 28 @.@ 4 points per game in the regular season , again taking the scoring crown , and had 3 @.@ 1 assists per game . In that year , the NBA introduced a new statistic : rebounds . In this category , Mikan also stood out ; his 14 @.@ 1 rebounds per game ( rpg ) was only second to the 16 @.@ 4 rpg of Dolph Schayes of Syracuse . In that year , Mikan participated in one of the most notorious NBA games ever played . When the Fort Wayne Pistons played against his Lakers , the Pistons took a 19 – 18 lead . Afraid that Mikan would mount a comeback if he got the ball , the Pistons passed the ball around without any attempt to score a basket . With no shot clock invented yet to force them into offense , the score stayed 19 – 18 to make it the lowest @-@ scoring NBA game of all time . This game was an important factor in the development of the shot clock , which was introduced four years later . Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers ' 18 points , thus scoring 83 @.@ 3 % of his team 's points , setting an NBA all @-@ time record . In the post season , Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals . With Mikan hardly able to move all series long , the Royals won 3 – 1 . Decades later , in 1990 , Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate ; however , despite effectively hopping around the court on one foot , he said he still averaged 20 @-@ odd points per game . 
 In the 1951 – 52 NBA season , the NBA decided to widen the foul lane under the basket from 6 feet to 12 feet . As players could stay in the lane for only three seconds at a time , it forced big men like Mikan to post @-@ up from double the distance . A main proponent of this rule was New York Knicks coach Joe Lapchick , who regarded Mikan as his nemesis , and it was dubbed " The Mikan Rule " . While Mikan still scored an impressive 23 @.@ 8 points per game , it was a serious reduction from his 27 @.@ 4 points per game the previous season , and his field goal percentage sank from .428 to .385 . He still pulled down 13 @.@ 5 rebounds per game , asserting himself as a top rebounder , and logged 3 @.@ 0 assists per game . Mikan also had a truly dominating game that season , in which he scored a personal @-@ best 61 points in a double overtime victory against the Rochester Royals . At the time , it was the second @-@ best performance in league history behind Joe Fulks ' 63 @-@ point score in 1949 , and Mikan 's output more than doubled that of his teammates , whose output that game totaled 30 points . In the 1952 NBA All @-@ Star Game , Mikan had a strong performance with 26 points and 15 rebounds in a West loss . Later that season , the Lakers reached the 1952 NBA Finals and were pitted against the New York Knicks . This qualified as one of the strangest Finals series in NBA history , as neither team could play on their home court in the first six games . The Lakers ' Minneapolis Auditorium was already booked , and the Knicks ' Madison Square Garden was occupied by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus . Instead , the Lakers played in St. Paul and the Knicks in the damp , dimly lit 69th Regiment Armory . <unk> double @-@ teamed by Knicks ' Nat Clifton and Harry Gallatin , Mikan was unable to assert himself and it was more Vern Mikkelsen 's credit that the first six games were split . In the only true home game , Game 7 in the Auditorium , the Lakers won 82 – 65 and edged the Knicks 4 – 3 , winning the NBA title and earning themselves $ 7 @,@ 500 to split among the team . 
 During the 1952 – 53 NBA season , Mikan averaged 20 @.@ 6 points and a career @-@ high 14 @.@ 4 rebounds per game , the highest in the league , as well as 2 @.@ 9 assists per game . In the 1953 NBA All @-@ Star Game , Mikan was dominant again with 22 points and 16 rebounds , winning that game 's MVP Award . The Lakers made the 1953 NBA Finals , and again defeated the Knicks 4 – 1 . 
 In the 1953 – 54 NBA season , the now 29 @-@ year @-@ old Mikan slowly declined , averaging 18 @.@ 1 points , 14 @.@ 3 rebounds and 2 @.@ 4 assists per game . Under his leadership , the Lakers won another NBA title in the 1954 NBA Finals , making it their third @-@ straight championship and fifth in six years ; the only time they lost had been when Mikan fractured his leg . From an NBA perspective , the Minneapolis Lakers dynasty has only been convincingly surpassed by the eleven @-@ title Boston Celtics dynasty of 1957 – 69 . At the end of the season , Mikan announced his retirement . He later said : " I had a family growing , and I decided to be with them . I felt it was time to get started with the professional world outside of basketball . " Injuries also were a factor , as Mikan had sustained 10 broken bones and 16 stitches in his career , often having to play through these injuries . 
 Without Mikan , the Lakers made the playoffs , but were unable to reach the 1955 NBA Finals . In the middle of the 1955 – 56 NBA season , Mikan returned to the Lakers lineup . He played in 37 games , but his long absence had affected his play . He averaged only 10 @.@ 5 points , 8 @.@ 3 rebounds and 1 @.@ 3 assists , and the Lakers lost in the first round of the playoffs . At the end of the season , Mikan retired for good . His 10 @,@ 156 points were a record at the time ; he was the first NBA player to score 10 @,@ 000 points in a career . He was inducted into the inaugural Basketball Hall of Fame class of 1959 and was declared the greatest player of the first half of the century by The Associated Press .

 In 1956 , Mikan was the Republican candidate for the United States Congress in Minnesota 's 3rd congressional district . He challenged incumbent Representative Roy Wier in a closely fought race that featured a high voter turnout . Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President Dwight Eisenhower , the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52 % to 48 % . Wier received 127 @,@ 356 votes to Mikan 's 117 @,@ 716 . Returning to the legal profession , Mikan was frustrated , after hoping for an influx of work . For six months , Mikan did not get any assignments at all , leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him to cash in on his life insurance . 
 Problems also arose in Mikan 's professional sports career . In the 1957 – 58 NBA season , Lakers coach John Kundla became general manager and persuaded Mikan to become coach of the Lakers . However , this was a failure , as the Lakers endured a 9 – 30 record until Mikan stepped down and returned coaching duties to Kundla . The Lakers ended with a 19 – 53 record , to record one of the worst seasons in their history . After this failure , Mikan then concentrated on his law career , raising his family of six children , successfully specializing in corporate and real estate law , and buying and renovating buildings in Minneapolis . 
 In 1967 , Mikan returned to professional basketball , becoming the first commissioner of the American Basketball Association , a rival league to the NBA . In order to lure basketball fans to his league , Mikan invented the league 's characteristic red @-@ white @-@ and @-@ blue ABA ball , which he thought more patriotic , better suited for TV , and more crowd @-@ pleasing than the brown NBA ball , and instituted the three @-@ point line . Mikan resigned from the ABA in 1969 . 
 In the mid @-@ 1980s , Mikan headed a task force with a goal of returning professional basketball to Minneapolis , decades after the Lakers had moved to Los Angeles to become the Los Angeles Lakers , and after the ABA 's Minnesota <unk> and Minnesota Pipers had departed . This bid was successful , leading to the inception of a new franchise in the 1989 – 90 NBA season , the Minnesota Timberwolves . 
 In 1994 , Mikan became the part @-@ owner and chairman of the board of the Chicago Cheetahs , a professional roller hockey team based in Chicago , Illinois , that played in Roller Hockey International . The franchise folded after their second season . 
 In his later years , Mikan suffered from diabetes and failing kidneys , and eventually , his illness caused his right leg to be amputated below the knee . When his medical insurance was cut off , Mikan soon found himself in severe financial difficulties . He fought a long and protracted legal battle against the NBA and the NBA Players ' Union , protesting the $ 1 @,@ 700 / month pensions for players who had retired before 1965 , the start of the so @-@ called " big money era " . According to Mel Davis of the National Basketball Retired Players Union , this battle kept him going , because Mikan hoped to be alive when a new collective bargaining agreement would finally vindicate his generation . In 2005 , however , his condition worsened . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Mikan is lauded as the pioneer of Modern Age basketball . He was the original center , who scored 11 @,@ 764 points , an average of 22 @.@ 6 per game , retired as the all @-@ time leading scorer and averaged 13 @.@ 4 rebounds and 2 @.@ 8 assists in 520 NBL , BAA and NBA games . As a testament to his fierce playing style , he also led the league three times in personal fouls . He won seven NBL , BAA , and NBA championships , an All @-@ Star MVP trophy , and three scoring titles , and was a member of the first four NBA All @-@ Star games and the first six All @-@ BAA and All @-@ NBA Teams . As well as being declared the greatest player of the first half of the century by The Associated Press , Mikan was on the Helms Athletic Foundation all @-@ time All @-@ American team , chosen in a 1952 poll , was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959 , made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980 and was elected one of the NBA 50 Greatest Players in 1996 . Mikan 's impact on the game is also reflected in the Mikan Drill , today a staple exercise of " big men " in basketball . 
 When superstar center Shaquille O 'Neal became a member of the Los Angeles Lakers , Mikan appeared on a Sports Illustrated cover in November 1996 with O 'Neal and Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar , calling Abdul @-@ Jabbar and Mikan the " Lakers legends " to whom O 'Neal was compared . Since April 2001 , a statue of Mikan shooting his trademark hook shot graces the entrance of the Minnesota Timberwolves ' Target Center . In addition , a banner in the Staples Center commemorates Mikan and his fellow Minneapolis Lakers . He is also honored by a statue and an appearance on a mural in his hometown of Joliet , Illinois . 
 = = = Rule changes = = = 
 Mikan became so dominant that the NBA had to change its rules of play in order to reduce his influence , such as widening the lane from six to twelve feet ( " The Mikan Rule " ) . He also played a role in the introduction of the shot clock ; and in the NCAA , his dominating play around the basket led to the outlawing of defensive goaltending . Mikan was a harbinger of the NBA 's future , which would be dominated by tall , powerful players . 
 As an official , Mikan is also directly responsible for the ABA three @-@ point line which was later adopted by the NBA ; the existence of the Minnesota Timberwolves ; and the multi @-@ colored ABA ball , which still lives on as the " money ball " in the NBA All @-@ Star Three @-@ Point Contest .

 In 1947 , he married his girlfriend Patricia , who remained his wife for the next 58 years until he died . Mikan fathered six children , sons Larry , Terry , Patrick and Michael , and daughters Trisha and Maureen .

He was also the older brother of Ed Mikan , another basketball player for both DePaul and the BAA .

 Mikan died in Scottsdale , Arizona , on June 1 , 2005 , of complications from diabetes and other ailments . His son Terry reported that his father had undergone dialysis three times a week , four hours a day , for the last five years . He was interred at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis . 
 Mikan 's death was widely mourned by the basketball world , and also brought media attention to the financial struggles of several early @-@ era NBA players . Many felt that the current players of the big @-@ money generation should rally for larger pensions for the pre @-@ 1965 predecessors in upcoming labor negotiations . Shaquille O 'Neal paid for Mikan 's funeral . He said : " Without number 99 [ Mikan ] , there is no me . " Before Game 5 of the 2005 Eastern Conference Finals between the Heat and the Detroit Pistons , there was a moment of silence to honor Mikan . Bob Cousy remarked that Mikan figuratively carried the NBA in the early days and single @-@ handedly made the league credible and popular . The 2005 NBA Finals between the Pistons and the San Antonio Spurs was dedicated to Mikan .

 Harry Edwin Strom ( July 7 , 1914 – October 2 , 1984 ) was the ninth Premier of Alberta , Canada , from 1968 to 1971 . His two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years as Premier were the last of the thirty @-@ six @-@ year Social Credit dynasty , as his defeat by Peter Lougheed saw its replacement by a new era Progressive Conservative government . He is remembered as an honest , decent man who lacked the political skills of his predecessor , Ernest Manning , or of Lougheed . 
 Alberta 's first native @-@ born Premier , Strom was born in Burdett , Alberta . He worked most of his young adult life on the family farm , and was also actively involved in his church . After a stint in municipal politics , he ran for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 1955 provincial election , and was elected . In 1962 , Manning appointed him to his cabinet as Minister of Agriculture , a position he held until 1967 when he was appointed Minister of Municipal Affairs . When Manning decided to resign in 1968 , Strom became a candidate to succeed him , and finished on top of a six candidate field . 
 As Premier , Strom undertook a number of initiatives , especially in education and youth @-@ related fields , but was politically ineffective . He lacked both charisma and an overriding sense of purpose , and his government gradually lost popularity . In the 1971 election , his government was handily defeated by Lougheed 's Progressive Conservatives . Strom served as opposition leader for two years , but soon relinquished the position and did not seek re @-@ election in 1975 . After leaving politics , Strom returned to farming . He died in 1984 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Strom was born in Burdett , Alberta , on July 7 , 1914 . His parents , Nils Hjalmar Strom ( 1877 – 1928 ) and <unk> Maria Olivia <unk> ( 1883 – 1969 ) , were second generation Swedish Canadians . He attended school in Burdett before moving to Calgary to attend high school at East Calgary High School and Calgary Technical High School , where he studied mechanics . In 1931 , he received a certificate from the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art . His father died the same year , and Strom returned home to help his mother with the operation of the family farm . 
 On October 27 , 1938 , Strom married Ruth Johnson , with whom he would have six children — Howard , Faith , Beverly , Brian , Ronald , and Arlene . The family attended the Evangelical Free Church of Canada in Bow Island until 1962 . There , Strom served as Sunday school teacher , deacon , and board chair , in addition to his twenty years of involvement with the church 's Overseas Missions Board . Besides his activities with the church , Strom was involved in the Forty Mile Rural Electrification Association , the Burdett Home and School Association , and the Agricultural Improvement Association of Burdett .

 In the 1955 provincial election , Strom ran as the Social Credit candidate in Cypress , where the incumbent , Social Crediter James <unk> , was not seeking re @-@ election . He easily defeated his only opponent , Liberal Joe <unk> , and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta . He would be re @-@ elected to this seat in each of the 1959 , 1963 , 1967 , and 1971 elections , always winning more than 60 % of the vote . 
 In October 1962 , Premier Ernest Manning appointed Strom Minister of Agriculture . In this capacity , he undertook a series of initiatives related to water use , including developing an agreement with Saskatchewan and Manitoba of the use of water emanating from the eastern slopes of Alberta 's Rocky Mountains . He also passed a series of legislation , including the Soil Conservation Act and Crop Insurance Act , and undertook a major departmental organization . The Alberta Agriculture Hall of Fame , which inducted Strom in 1985 , credited him with expanding the use of irrigation in the province and for being a key figure leading up to the signing of a 1973 cost @-@ sharing agreement on the subject with the federal government . He also served as Minister of Municipal Affairs for the last five months of the Manning government . 
 = = = Leadership election = = = 
 When Manning decided to retire in 1968 , he called a key group of senior ministers to his office to advise them of his decision . This group includes Strom , Treasurer Anders Aalborg , Industry Minister Russ Patrick , Education Minister Randy McKinnon . Aalborg was the natural choice to succeed Manning , but he had health problems and declined to run . Strom had no desire for the job and rejected any suggestion from the others that he be a candidate . 
 This rejection was not to last : a group of influential young Social Crediters , including the Premier 's son Preston , started a movement to draft Strom . They settled on him because he was personally popular among party members and because he had displayed an openness to new ideas in the past . Strom accepted their overtures , but as late as a week before he announced his candidacy he was still offering to step aside in favour of another candidate of the young Turks ' choice . 
 Strom 's campaign theme was " the social development of Alberta " , and this general theme encompassed such diverse policy planks as a citizens ' committee on constitutional reform , a head start program for disadvantaged youth , commissions on the future of urban planning and education , an expansion of the role of backbenchers in policy development , and the opening of a branch of the Premier 's office in Calgary . Though he entered as the favourite , a poll in spring 1969 showed him running second of five candidates behind Minister of Transportation Gordon Taylor . However , he had the strongest organization of any candidate , thanks in large part to his young backers , and overcame this deficit by the fall . 
 At the convention , Strom won a large plurality on the first ballot , finishing with nearly three times of the votes of the second place Taylor . Though the third place Raymond <unk> threw his support to the Transportation Minister before the second ballot , the results on this were decisive : Strom gained the support of more than a hundred new delegates and won a clear majority .

 Harry Strom became Premier December 12 , 1968 and served until the 1971 election , when his government was defeated by Peter Lougheed 's Progressive Conservatives . This tenure makes him the fourth shortest @-@ serving former Premier in Alberta 's history , after Dave Hancock , Jim Prentice , and Richard G. Reid . 
 = = = Policy initiatives = = = 
 Many of Strom 's policy initiatives revolved around education and youth . He created the Alberta Service Corps , which allowed young Albertans to work summers on public services and environmental projects for remuneration , and which was one of several models for the federal government 's later <unk> program . In response to increasing use of illicit drugs by Alberta youth , his government , led by Education Minister Bob Clark , inserted anti @-@ narcotics messages into the province 's school curriculum . Strom implemented trial kindergarten programs in Edmonton and Calgary — the Calgary program , provided jointly by an inner @-@ city community association and the Mount Royal College , has been called one of Canada 's first public @-@ private partnerships . His interest in educational matters was perhaps best exemplified by his government 's Commission on Educational Planning , which travelled the province to solicit Albertans ' views and whose final report , A Choice of Futures , was credited by Barr as setting " the tone and direction for education in Alberta for the next generation " . The Strom government also made substantial reforms to Alberta 's post @-@ secondary education system , expanding distance learning through the creation of Athabasca University and laying the foundation 's for <unk> television , and effectively creating the province 's College ( as distinct from University ) system . This latter move led to the creation of Grant MacEwan College . 
 Strom also took a number of non @-@ educational policy initiative , such as naming Jim Henderson as the province 's first Environment Minister . Other priorities were the reform of the Premier 's Office and the establishment of an Intergovernmental Affairs Secretariat , converted by Peter Lougheed 's government into a full ministry under Don Getty . In 1970 , the government established the Alberta Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Commission . 
 = = = Leadership style = = = 
 Strom resisted leadership and saw himself as a conciliator , charged with maintaining unity among his cabinet and caucus . Soon after becoming Premier , Strom chief of staff Don Hamilton and strategist Owen Anderson scheduled strategy meetings with agendas drawn from Strom 's leadership platform . The meetings did not lead to action , and some began to grumble that " talking about decisions was a form of action " . According to Barr , Hamilton eventually started using the same agenda every week , with only the date changed , and Strom did not notice . 
 Strom was not an effective speaker and often would not look at the text of his speeches until he was delivering them . Realizing this , Hamilton once handed him a folder with nothing but a paper reading " Sock it to ' em , Harry " before the Premier was to give a speech at the University of Alberta . The Premier opened the folder and , as he became visibly alarmed , gratefully received the real speech when an aide brought it to him . 
 Strom also resisted calling an early election to give his government a fresh mandate , despite Hamilton 's impassioned advocacy for this course of action . He was no more positive towards Anderson 's proposals for a radical overhaul of the party , including the computerization of political data ( such as voting trends , demographic shifts , and polling results ) and the purchase of an office building to make the party a profit and free it from the need for fundraising . The ideas that Strom did not reject outright were referred to committees and study groups where they were watered down or shelved . 
 Despite these failings , Strom was recognized as possessing a number of virtues : he was kind , considerate , and honest . Most of all , he was humble : he had not sought the party leadership and notoriously asked after being repeatedly addressed as " Premier " at his first cabinet meeting why it could not " just be plain ' Harry ' anymore " . When travelling to Ottawa , he stayed at the un @-@ posh Skyline Hotel and ate meals in its basement cafeteria , where he ordered bread and pea soup for $ 0 @.@ 25 . On final analysis , Barr concludes that this temperament , commendable though it may be , was unsuited to running the government of an emerging economic powerhouse . 
 = = = Defeat = = = 
 Though the legislature 's mandate from the 1967 election was not due to expire until May 1972 , five years after it started , convention in Canadian politics is for legislatures to be dissolved every four years or less . Accordingly , Strom resolved to call an election in 1971 , sometime between May and September . After considering the spring , in the hopes that the planting season would have farmers feeling optimistic and therefore inclined to support the incumbent government , Strom finally settled on August 30 ( partly out of concerns that farmers would resent an election called in the middle of the planting or harvest seasons ) . A campaign committee was assembled , and recommended a budget of $ 580 @,@ 000 . 
 The party recruited star candidates , including Calgary alderman George Ho Lem and former Calgary Stampeder star Don Luzzi ( Edmonton alderman and future mayor Cec Purves was defeated in his bid to win the Social Credit nomination in Edmonton @-@ Strathcona from Strathcona Centre incumbent Joseph Donovan Ross ) , but was handicapped in these efforts by Strom 's unwillingness to offer cabinet posts or other incentives to potential new candidates . Strom 's lack of personal charisma was also a liability : tellingly , of the large budget recommended by the central committee , only $ 72 @,@ 000 was recommended for use on television advertising , where Strom did not shine . The party tried to revitalize the Premier 's image through publicity movies , though efforts were mixed . In one , which was pulled after a single showing , Strom appeared scowling in his living room , urging Albertans to lower their expectations of government . Another , produced by Tommy Banks and showing Strom in a variety of settings talking about the province 's changing face , was more successful . 
 The campaign did not give Social Credit partisans much reason for optimism . Strom did not draw the crowds that Progressive Conservative Peter Lougheed did , although an August 25 rally in Edmonton 's Jubilee Auditorium featuring speeches by Strom and Manning was full . After criticizing the Conservatives ' medicare platform , which promised free medicare to Albertans older than 65 , as spendthrift , Strom announced Social Credit 's barely cheaper alternative : medicare to Albertans older than 65 for one dollar per month . The Edmonton Journal , which had earlier published a poll showing that a plurality of Edmontonians intended to vote P.C. , endorsed Lougheed for Premier . Election night saw Social Credit defeated , taking 25 seats to the P.C.s ' 49 . Though Social Credit 's share of the vote had only slipped slightly , Lougheed benefited from a substantial reduction in the New Democrats ' vote and a near @-@ collapse of the Liberals ' . The party was also decimated in the province 's two largest cities , losing all of its seats in Edmonton and all but five in Calgary . 
 Strom conceded defeat in Edmonton and returned home to Medicine Hat . 
 = = Out of office and legacy = = 
 Strom continued as Social Credit leader , serving as leader of the opposition , until 1972 , when he resigned and was replaced by Werner Schmidt . He continued in the legislature until the 1975 election , in which he did not seek re @-@ election . After leaving politics , he returned to his farm and his involvement with his church . He died of cancer October 2 , 1984 , and was buried in Medicine Hat . 
 In honour of his political services , Strom received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of Calgary ( 1969 ) , the University of Lethbridge ( 1979 ) , and the University of Alberta ( 1980 ) . While several of his acts as premier had consequences extending well beyond his term , today he is largely forgotten , though he experienced a brief resurgence in name recognition in 2007 . That year , critics of Ed Stelmach compared Stelmach to Strom , with the insinuation being that Stelmach was destined to lose the next election and be the last of the Progressive Conservative dynasty in the same way that Strom was the last of the Social Credit dynasty . In the end , it would not be until the 2015 provincial election under the leadership of Jim Prentice that the Progressive Conservatives would be defeated , with some pundits also comparing Prentice to Strom .

 = Wind It Up ( Gwen Stefani song ) = 
 " Wind It Up " is a song by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani . Originally written for inclusion on Stefani 's Harajuku Lovers Tour 2005 , the song was later recorded for her second solo studio album , The Sweet Escape ( 2006 ) , due to favorable reception . The track contains an interpolation of The Sound of Music song " The Lonely Goatherd " . 
 " Wind It Up " was negatively received by music critics , who criticized the song 's use of yodeling and found the track to be over the top . It was released as the album 's lead single on October 31 , 2006 and reached the top 20 in most music markets . The accompanying music video , which became popular on stations such as Total Request Live , was directed by Sophie Muller and takes influence from The Sound of Music . 
 = = Background and writing = = 
 In July 2005 , Stefani began writing and recording material with Pharrell Williams in Miami , Florida . During one of their sessions , they penned " Wind It Up " for a September 2005 fashion show revealing the 2006 collection of Stefani 's fashion line L.A.M.B. 
 Stefani asked DJ Jeremy Healy to create a mashup of the song and " The Lonely Goatherd " , a song from the 1959 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical and 1965 film The Sound of Music . Stefani considered The Sound of Music her favorite film , and she had wanted to incorporate a beat to one of its songs all her life . Stefani commented , " I literally cried , and I 'm not exaggerating , when I heard the mash @-@ up . " Williams , however , did not like the addition of yodeling and The Sound of Music to the track . 
 The lyrics are not narrative , and Stefani stated , " A song like ' Wind It Up ' isn 't about anything . " In the song , Stefani discusses how boys watch girls dance . The song includes a reference to Stefani 's fashion line , with Stefani going , " They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going ' cross my shirt " . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Wind It Up " received negative reviews by contemporary pop music critics . Entertainment Weekly 's Michael Slezak found the bassline " rubbery " and criticized the song for lacking a melody as well as its reference to Stefani 's own clothing line . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that The Neptunes had forced the sampling " into one of their typical minimalist tracks , over which Gwen spouts off clumsy material @-@ minded lyrics touting her fashion line and her shape " . Bill Lamb of About.com rated the song three and a half stars , giving it " high marks for entertainment value " , but commented that it sounded like a retread of " Rich Girl " from Stefani 's debut album Love . Angel . Music . Baby . Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine was mixed on the track , writing that " it 's preventing something far less interesting from getting played . " John Murphy from musicOMH panned the track as " just horrible , and possibly the worst start to an album this year " . Spence D. from IGN characterized the song as " a bugged out Sound Of Music bhangra blitz that sounds like part M.I.A. and part Julie Andrews " . 
 Many criticized the inclusion of yodeling and " The Lonely Goatherd " sample . In a review for Rolling Stone , Rob Sheffield called the track " yodel @-@ <unk> " and argued that " the problem isn 't the Swiss Miss motif so much as the fourth @-@ rate Neptunes track . Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian was pleased with the track , describing the yodeling as " off @-@ her @-@ head " , and referred to the track as " a pinnacle of madness " . IndieLondon 's Jack Foley noted " Wind It Up " as a highlight of The Sweet Escape and called it " Stefani 's gift that she can take something that , on paper , sounds cheesy and make it utterly , utterly cool . " USA Today 's Ken Barnes , however , found the track " campy " and " a tacky attempt at sexiness " , adding that the combination of yodeling and the interpolation was " awkward " . Alex Miller of the NME also found the song campy , commenting that its " dumb sexual bravado has all the sophistication of a teenage boy 's wet dream " , and compared the yodeling , interpolation , and " erotic rap " to " a trench foot which screams for amputation from the <unk> " . 
 In the face of criticism , Stefani has defended the track : 
 I knew some people wouldn 't get it but I think I am enough down the line to not care . The people that did get it are Sound Of Music fans and really got a lot of pleasure from it . I still think it 's brilliant and I stand by it . Why can 't you do something weird for a while ? These songs are all about having fun , silly records that are to be enjoyed and not taken too seriously .

In another scene , Stefani uses curtains to create sailor suits for the Harajuku Girls . Stefani also appears as a nun and an orchestra conductor . One scene uses smoke to create the illusion that Stefani is a submerged escape artist searching for a key . She pulls the key , a symbol of " the sweet escape " , from her mouth as an allusion to performances by escapologist Harry Houdini . The song 's title is often visualized by a colorful sign that reads " wind it up " . Another video was produced in 3 @-@ D , but this version was never released .

 = Tropical Storm Podul ( 2013 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Podul , known in the Philippines as Tropical Depression Zoraida , was a weak but destructive tropical cyclone that affected the Philippines shortly after the devastating Typhoon Haiyan . The 31st named storm of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season , Podul developed as a tropical depression on November 11 between Palau and the Philippine island of Mindanao . The system moved west @-@ northwestward and struck Davao Oriental in Mindanao on November 12 , bringing heavy rainfall that killed two people and disrupted relief efforts following Haiyan . After crossing the Philippines , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Podul on November 14 . Shortly thereafter , the storm struck southeastern Vietnam , and its circulation dissipated on November 15 . In Vietnam , Podul produced heavy rainfall that resulted in severe flooding . The storm damaged or destroyed 427 @,@ 258 houses , and overall damage was estimated at 1 @.@ 5 trillion ₫ ( 2013 Vietnamese dong , $ 72 million 2013 USD ) . Podul killed 42 people in the country and caused 74 injuries . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On November 9 , an area of disorganized convection , or thunderstorms , persisted about 1175 km ( 730 mi ) southeast of Palau . The system consisted of a broad circulation , affected to its detriment by moderate wind shear . Moving west @-@ northwestward , the convection persisted and organized into the circulation , indicative of an increased potential for tropical cyclogenesis . Late on November 10 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) , meaning the agency anticipated a tropical depression would develop within 24 hours . Shortly thereafter , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Zoraida after the system entered its area of responsibility of the agency . At 1200 UTC on November 11 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) estimated that a tropical depression formed about halfway between Palau and the Philippine island of Mindanao , although operationally the agency had classified the system two days prior . 
 After passing south of Palau , the system 's circulation became more broad and its convection became less organized , despite decreased wind shear . Early on November 12 , the depression made landfall on Mindanao in Davao Oriental province . Shortly thereafter , PAGASA discontinued advisories on Zoraida , declaring that the depression degenerated into a low pressure area . By contrast , the JMA continued monitoring the depression as it moved through the Philippines and into the Sulu Sea . On November 13 , the center crossed over Palawan island into the South China Sea . At 1200 UTC the next day , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Podul about 275 km ( 170 mi ) east of the Vietnam coast . Around the same time , the JTWC began issuing warnings on the system as a tropical depression <unk> , noting that convection had rapidly increased over the circulation . The agency also mentioned the continued presence of wind shear , although warm water temperatures and moderate outflow were expected to allow intensification . Although the JMA estimated peak 10 – minute winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) , the JTWC only estimated tropical depression @-@ force 1 – minute winds of 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) . 
 Late on November 14 , Podul made landfall in southeastern Vietnam near Phan Rang – Tháp <unk> and quickly weakened into a tropical depression . The JTWC assessed the circulation was dissipating near the coast , and the JMA declared Podul dissipated at 1200 UTC on November 15 . Operationally , the agency tracked the system into the Gulf of Thailand , and the Thai Meteorological Department tracked Podul to near the Malay Peninsula on November 16 , before ceasing advisories on the storm . The remnants later redeveloped into Cyclonic Storm Helen in the Bay of Bengal , which later struck southeastern India on November 22 before dissipating .

 The Guam National Weather Service warned of the potential of heavy rainfall and high surf for Palau and nearby Yap island . While passing south of Palau , the system produced light winds of about 28 km / h ( 17 mph ) . 
 Late on November 10 , as the system moved into the Philippine area of responsibility , PAGASA issued the Public Storm Warning Signal Number 1 for seven areas in Mindanao , indicating the potential for winds between 30 – 60 km / h ( 20 – 35 mph ) . Over the next day these warnings were extended to cover three provinces in Luzon , eight provinces in Visayas and twenty @-@ one provinces in Mindanao . On Cebu Island , officials ordered schools to close during the storm 's passage . After the extreme damage due to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines , the depression that became Podul affected the same areas just days later , which affected rescue work . The depression caused additional difficulties in travel and communications . In addition to causing a landslide in <unk> , flooding from the depression covered roads and forced about 1 @,@ 000 families to evacuate . In Davao del Norte , the depression resulted in river flooding that killed two people . 
 In Vietnam , Podul produced heavy rainfall , peaking at 973 mm ( 38 @.@ 3 in ) in two districts in Quảng Ngãi Province . The rains caused flooding that forced over 78 @,@ 000 people to flee their homes , including 1 @,@ 400 the resort town Hội An where floodwaters reached 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) deep . High volumes of flooding caused water to be released from reservoirs , which some local officials credited for the widespread flooding . About 260 km ( 160 mi ) of canals and dykes were washed away during the storm . The high rainfall increased water levels along rivers , with the Ba River in Gia Lai Province reaching 410 mm ( 16 in ) higher than the record set in 1981 . Flooding also damaged over 6 @,@ 000 ha ( 15 @,@ 000 acres ) of crops , mostly to rice . Podul damaged or flooded about 280 @,@ 000 m2 ( 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of roadways and bridges , resulting in traffic jams , and halted three train lines . The storm damaged or destroyed 427 @,@ 258 houses , and overall damage was estimated at 1 @.@ 5 trillion ₫ ( 2013 Vietnamese dong , $ 72 million 2013 USD ) . Throughout Vietnam , Podul killed 42 people and injured 74 others . By November 20 , the floods began receding from most locations . Newspapers described the flooding as the worst in Vietnam since 1999 . After the storm , the Vietnamese provincial governments assisted in rebuilding houses and roads .

 SR 213 originated as a minor road that connected U.S. Route 97 ( US 97 ) to the area south of the Okanogan River and Malott ; the road first appeared on a map in 1954 . In 1959 , the Washington State Legislature passed a law that created a branch of Primary State Highway 16 ( PSH 16 ) that extended from PSH 16 near Okanogan to US 97 in Malott to take effect on July 1 , 1961 . By 1963 , US 97 was realigned south of the Okanogan River and the PSH 16 branch was extended across the river . During a highway renumbering in 1964 , PSH 16 became SR 20 and the branch of PSH 16 became SR 20 Spur . In 1973 , SR 20 Spur became SR 213 , while another SR 20 Spur was established in Anacortes .

The freeway continues for another 3 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) with interchanges for local streets in this part of Detroit , including 7 Mile Road . At the interchange with M @-@ 102 ( 8 Mile Road ) , the freeway crosses out of Detroit and Wayne County into Southfield in Oakland County .

 The service drives change names again to Northwestern Highway upon crossing into Oakland County . The east side of M @-@ 10 is flanked by the Northland Shopping Center and a campus of Oakland Community College ; the west side is residential . About 1 1 ⁄ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 0 km ) into Southfield , M @-@ 10 intersects the northern end of M @-@ 39 ( Southfield Freeway ) and 9 Mile Road . The adjacent properties are mostly residential , but there are some commercial areas centered around the various Mile Roads , such as the campus of Lawrence Technological University at 10 Mile Road . Near Lahser and 11 Mile roads , M @-@ 10 meets I @-@ 696 ( Reuther Freeway ) and US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) in a complex interchange called the Mixing Bowl . This interchange spans over two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) near the American Center .

 Northwest of this interchange , M @-@ 10 transitions to a boulevard with Michigan lefts . Called just Northwestern Highway , M @-@ 10 runs through suburban residential areas of Southfield . At the intersection with Inkster Road , the highway clips the southwest corner of the city of Franklin and enters the northeastern corner of Farmington Hills . The roadway is lined with commercial properties while just behind them are residential subdivisions and two golf courses . At the intersection with 14 Mile Road , Northwestern Highway crosses into West Bloomfield Township , and 1 ⁄ 4 mile ( 0 @.@ 40 km ) further on , the highway ends at Orchard Lake Road .

 = = = Previous designations = = = 
 In 1919 , the state numbered its highways for the first time . In the initial allocation of numbers , M @-@ 10 was assigned to a highway that started at the Ohio state line south of Monroe , ran northeasterly along Telegraph Road into Dearborn and turned easterly into Detroit . From there , the highway turned north along Woodward Avenue through Pontiac and Dixie Highway through Flint and Saginaw to Bay City . Then M @-@ 10 ran along the Saginaw Bay to Standish and turned to follow the Lake Huron shoreline , with some substantial deviations inland . The highway generally followed the lakeshore as far north as Alpena and Rogers City , and from there , M @-@ 10 ran due west through Onaway before turning north into Cheboygan . The last section of M @-@ 10 followed the Lake Huron shoreline to Mackinaw City , where it terminated . This designation lasted until November 11 , 1926 , when the United States Numbered Highway System was created . In Michigan 's initial allocation of highways , four new designations replaced M @-@ 10 : US 24 from the state line north to Dearborn , US 112 between Dearborn and Detroit , US 10 from Detroit to Saginaw , and US 23 from Saginaw to Mackinaw City . At the time , no M @-@ 10 designation was reassigned to any other roads . 
 The second iteration of M @-@ 10 was designated in 1929 on a much shorter segment of the original M @-@ 10 through the Flint area , serving as a business connection for the city as the through route , US 10 , bypassed it on the east . It was later redesignated as Business US 10 ( Bus . US 10 ) in 1941 , and then as Bus . M @-@ 54 in 1962 before being turned back to local control in 1974 . 
 = = = Current designation = = = 
 During the 1950s , the Lodge Freeway was proposed to run from Detroit as far as the Fenton – Clio Expressway ( US 23 ) at Fenton . The intersection with the Edsel Ford Freeway , next to Wayne State University was built in 1953 and was the first full freeway @-@ to @-@ freeway interchange built in the United States . The freeway was dedicated on November 7 , 1957 , and opened without any state trunkline designation between downtown and the Wyoming Curve . The section from the Edsel Ford Freeway ( now I @-@ 94 ) into downtown Detroit was designated as US 12 by the middle of 1960 . 
 The freeway was then redesignated Business Spur I @-@ 696 ( BS I @-@ 696 ) in 1962 , and the next year the freeway was extended northwesterly along James Couzens Highway and Northwestern Highway into Southfield , connecting with the completed first phase of I @-@ 696 that opened in 1963 @-@ 64 . That designation remained until 1970 when US 10 was shifted off Woodward Avenue to follow the Lodge Freeway between downtown Detroit and Telegraph Road , replacing the BS I @-@ 696 designation . 
 An extension to the Northwestern Highway was again proposed in 1966 to connect with the proposed I @-@ 275 extension . The I @-@ 275 project was then cancelled in 1977 . The section of Northwestern Highway under state control between the West Bloomfield Township – Farmington Hills border into Southfield was numbered M @-@ 4 in 1979 . 
 The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in the mid @-@ 1980s to truncate US 10 to Bay City . The request was approved on October 11 , 1985 , and the signage was changed the next year . After the change , the Lodge Freeway was redesignated M @-@ 10 . The non @-@ freeway Northwestern Highway , until then designated M @-@ 4 , was also renumbered as M @-@ 10 . The southernmost portion of the Lodge Freeway was also initially redesignated as a portion of BS I @-@ 375 from I @-@ 75 south . By the next year however , the southern end of M @-@ 10 was moved to the corner of Jefferson and Randolph , placing all of the Lodge Freeway as part of M @-@ 10 . 
 From 2006 to 2007 , the Lodge underwent major reconstruction to ease traffic congestion in the metro area , temporarily closing down much of the freeway . The $ 133 million project ( equivalent to $ 155 million in 2015 ) included concrete pavement reconstruction and rehabilitation , new barrier walls , repairs or replacements to 50 bridges , upgrades to 22 ramps , utility upgrades , and replacement of freeway signs between Lahser Road in Southfield and Jefferson Avenue in Detroit .

 Starting in 1924 , officials in southeastern Michigan proposed building a highway from Detroit to run northwesterly across the state to Ludington , bisecting the angle created by Woodward and Grand River avenues . This roadway was named Northwestern Highway when it was built in 1929 to an endpoint at 14 Mile Road . Further construction on Northwestern Highway was halted by the Great Depression . 
 The freeway segment northwest of Wyoming Avenue to the county line was previously known as James Couzens Highway after the street it replaced . That street was named after the death of James J. Couzens . Couzens was a former Commissioner of Detroit 's Department of Street Railways from 1913 through 1915 , after which he served as Police Commissioner from 1916 until 1918 . He was Mayor of Detroit from 1919 until 1922 and United States Senator from Michigan from 1922 until his death on October 22 , 1936 . During his years of public service , he is said not to have accepted a salary , giving it all to charity . After his death , Detroit renamed its section of Northwestern Highway after Couzens . 
 John C. Lodge was a member of the constitutional convention which drafted the Michigan Constitution of 1908 , a former member of the Michigan Legislature and Detroit alderman and councilman . He later served as Mayor of Detroit in 1918 – 1919 before returned to the City Common Council from 1932 to 1947 . He was then elected to the Wayne County Board of Supervisors from 1948 until 1950 . In total , he held elective office longer than anyone in city history . He died on February 6 , 1950 , and the future Lodge Freeway was named in his honor on January 20 , 1953 . The entire freeway , including segments previously named for James Couzens and the Northwestern Highway was named the John C. Lodge Freeway in 1987 , although the service drives retained their original names .

 = Vanaja ( film ) = 
 Vanaja is a 2006 Indian Telugu @-@ language drama film written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli on a story that constituted his Master of Fine Arts thesis at Columbia University . The film was made on a shoestring budget using a cast of non @-@ professional first @-@ timers for two and a half months . 
 The film stars Mamatha Bhukya as the title character : a 15 @-@ year @-@ old daughter of a poor fisherman set in the backdrop of a rustic state of Andhra Pradesh in Southern India . She learns Kuchipudi , a classical Indian dance form , while being employed at a local landlady 's house . All seems to be going well for her until sexual chemistry evolves between her and the landlady 's son , and this eventually leads her being raped by him . The ensuing pregnancy disrupts her simple life , and she must choose how to deal with the child . 
 Vanaja was screened at several international festivals such as the Toronto International Film Festival and the Berlin International Film Festival , among others . It was nominated for the Diesel Discovery Award at the former and won the Best First Feature award at the latter . Beside this , it won several jury prizes at other film festivals , and was nominated for the Best First Feature and Best Cinematography awards at the Independent Spirit Awards . Vanaja found favour with many international critics as well . Roger Ebert ranked it among the five best foreign language films of 2007 . It runs for 111 minutes in with subtitles in English . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Vanaja ( Mamatha Bhukya ) is the 15 @-@ year @-@ old daughter of Somayya ( Ramachandriah Marikanti ) , a poor , low caste fisherman from rural Andhra Pradesh . Somayya struggles to support his family due to dwindling catches at sea and mounting debts . One day , Vanaja and her teenage friend Lacchi ( Bhavani Renukunta ) watch a theatrical performance by a former Kuchipudi ( a native classical Indian dance form ) great , Rama Devi ( Urmila Dammannagari ) . The sequence of events lead to a soothsayer predicting to Vanaja that she will be a great dancer . With permission from her father , she goes to work in the house of the local landlady Rama Devi with the hope of learning Kuchipudi . While she is employed as a farmhand , she is entrusted with tending the chickens . When she gets caught playfully chasing them , she lies to conceal her pranks . Her vivaciousness and spunk soon catch the landlady ’ s eye . To keep her out of trouble , Rama Devi soon promotes her to a kitchen underhand where she meets Rama Devi ’ s cook , the old , crusty and extremely loyal Radhamma ( Krishnamma Gundimalla ) . 
 After settling down at the landlady 's house , Vanaja gets invited to play a game of ashta <unk> ( a leisurely game in rural towns of Andhra Pradesh ) against the landlady . Knowing that losing isn ’ t the mistress ’ s forte , she deliberately gives up her game . This gesture , in turn , eventually secures her the landlady ’ s mentorship , first in music and then in dance . Vanaja excels at these art forms and seems to be on a steadily ascending path until the arrival of Shekhar ( Karan Singh ) , the landlady 's 23 @-@ year @-@ old son , from the United States . Shekhar is a handsome , muscular young man who is running for an office in the local government . Sexual chemistry is ignited between Shekhar and Vanaja ( still a minor at 15 ) when flirtation and sexual innuendo bloom . 
 In the meanwhile , her father 's fishing boat is taken away by creditors . He sinks into a state of sadness and begins to drink away their savings . On one occasion , Vanaja ’ s superior intellect pits her against Shekhar in a public incident which ultimately humiliates him in front of his mother . Matters escalate , and one day Vanaja is raped by Shekhar . She eventually loses her job when she becomes pregnant . She gives birth to a boy , much against Rama Devi ’ s wishes who would have liked her to abort the foetus . Vanaja hopes that the physical evidence of the child will be proof of the rape and that somehow Shekhar will be brought to justice . However , Shekhar has no desire to marry Vanaja because she is from a lower caste . In the end Rama Devi and Shekhar gain possession of the child , who will grow up to be an upper caste boy .

 Director Rajnesh Domalpalli graduated with bachelor 's and master 's degrees in electrical engineering in 1984 and 1986 . While working on his bachelor 's degree at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay , he wrote short stories . One of his stories , The Dowry , was twice selected for broadcast by BBC World Service while he was in graduate school . During schooling , he was introduced to south Indian classical music , especially on the veena , and followed this up with years of training on the vocals . 
 While he was working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley , California , he pursued filmmaking and graduated with a Master of Fine Arts degree from Columbia University . 
 A short synopsis , including a character and a conflict study of Vanaja , was Domalpalli 's project submission in his first semester at the Columbia University in fall of 2001 . The story was inspired by a child 's scream upon being separated from her mother in Sophie 's Choice . Over the next three semesters , however , the story veered from its original focus of mother @-@ child separation to what Domalpalli later described as a study of " elements of class distinction and conflict that continue to infuse our society and culture even today . " Referring to its emphasis , he said the film was also about " fading institutions of folk art , old buildings that are collapsing , things which we should be protecting — which are a part of our heritage . " Speaking of the need for preservation of Indian culture and heritage , he said that making the film was an opportunity to emphasize the Indian folk arts , too . 
 = = = Filmmaking = = = 
 With the early version of the script being ready at the end of his fourth semester , Domalpalli 's initial intent was to find financing for the film in India and then in the United States . However , he could not find financing . Domalpalli decided to select non @-@ professionals and train them in a year . In the United States , producers voiced similar concerns over the marketability of the film and what they referred to as " its lack of cohesion . " Beside this , Domalpalli 's inexperience in filmmaking added to their concerns . Recalling initial hurdles , Domalpalli later said , " it was only when I showed my professors a rough cut of the film , and they approved , that purse strings finally came loose . " It eventually constituted the thesis for his master 's degree . 
 He imbibed socio @-@ cultural ethos from his upbringing in several rural areas of Andhra Pradesh , and this prompted him to make the movie in the Telugu language . In 2004 , he began filming with a meagre sum of USD 20000 provided by his mother Latha Domalpalli , the eventual film producer . Referring to filming the <unk> ( a story telling technique used in southern India ) scene at the beginning of the film , Domalpalli said : 
 If you talk to people who perform a <unk> , you will see a huge difference in the way the older generation performs the art vis @-@ à @-@ vis the way the way the younger generation performs it ... This has happened because of the advent of television . <unk> is a long @-@ format art form . The point we are making is that if we don 't protect these folk arts , they will be on their way out . 
 The producers faced a stiff challenge in securing a rural bungalow to serve as the landlady 's mansion . Even after obtaining a building as the best possible fit in the coastal town of Bobbili , infestation of snakes and bats posed a problem for the crew . In addition , the building was not strong enough to support the filming equipment . Under these circumstances , the makeshift production designers refurbished the building with space for chicken coops and goat pens as required by the script . To make the space look inhabited , local help was sought for trampling the ground with their livestock . The local people wanted to act as extras in exchange for providing farming tools , bullock carts and other material . As a result , the crew had to ensure that these extras didn 't look into the camera during filming . 
 " Given the rural nature of the story , and the tendency of most local acting to lean towards the theatrical , it was clear that non @-@ actors drawn from hutments , labor camps and the vast Indian middle class were the right choice , " said Domalpalli , referring to his choice of casting . In addition , the inclusion of Radhamma 's character was to bring a natural feel for the film . Her behavior such as the way she " sits , stands , moves , grunts and groans — that is the way people from a village talk and behave ... You would immediately recognize a person who served you breakfast ... That makes a point . " 
 Referring to the challenges faced in casting , he said that while they were canvassing local people for auditions , they were warding off rumors that they were after the people 's kidneys . When placing a newspaper advertisement for the landlady 's character did not seem viable , they advertised for household help instead . Upon seeing this , Urmila Dammannagari turned up for the interview with Domalpalli . Inadvertently , their conversation veered toward the film and the real motive behind the advertisement became evident . Though initially shocked and despite the fact that she had to commute 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) from her house to the location , she took up the role . Professionally Krishnamma Gundimalla , who played the role of Radhamma , carried bricks on her head as a construction worker . On the other hand , Ramachandriah Marikanti , who plays Vanaja 's fisherman father , was a municipal sweeper and worked as a security guard . 
 For casting Vanaja and Lacchi , he said that they met approximately 2500 children , interviewed about 260 , and finally selected two from a shortlist of five to play the roles of Vanaja and Lacchi . Parents of these children were distrustful of them because their wards would have to frequently commute to Domalpalli 's house for acting lessons for at least a year . Domalpalli felt that " to convince people to devote so much of their children 's time and energy was hard enough , but to find the right combination of intelligence , commitment and talent as well was probably the steepest cliff they had to climb . " While visiting schools for identifying the child cast , Mamatha Bhukya at first was not selected because her hair was short . But after she sang a song on Mahatma Gandhi , she was selected for the role . Srinivas Devarakonda , a disciple of well @-@ known Kuchipudi guru <unk> Chinna Satyam , taught Mamatha the classical dance form for a year in the basement of Domalpalli 's house . Due to this sustained effort , she altered her ambitions from becoming a doctor to an actress and a Kuchipudi dancer . Bhavani Renukunta was chosen for Lacchi 's role after an interview at the Hyderabad office of <unk> Films , the company that handled the publicity . 
 Suriname @-@ born Milton Kam , who had shot 10 feature films and more than 50 short films , was chosen as the director of photography . Since Domalpalli 's experience was limited to short video films with a different aspect ratio , he was shocked to look through the Super 16mm lens the day they commenced the shoot . However , Kam helped him to stay composed during the production . 
 Domalpalli used Carnatic music for the background score . This featured the violin @-@ playing of B. S. Narayanan , a student of renowned Carnatic violinist T. N. Krishnan . Narayanan played the popular Jayadeva <unk> " Sa <unk> " , having retuned it in the mode or <unk> known as " <unk> " . 
 Domalpalli used " <unk> <unk> " in the film ; folk songs that are rarely heard . To record these songs for the film , Domalpalli and his crew traveled to towns and villages in rural Andhra .

 The film received an overall positive response from critics and was particularly noted for the theme and for Mamatha Bhukya 's performance . The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 85 % based on 26 critic reviews with an average rating of 7 / 10 . Roger Ebert described Bhukya as " a natural star , her eyes and smile illuminating a face of freshness and delight . " Writing about Vanaja , he added that " there are the glorious colors of saris and room decorations , the dazzle of dance costumes and the dusty landscape that somehow becomes a watercolor by Edward Lear , with its hills and vistas , its oxen and elephants , its houses that seem part of the land . In this setting , Domalpalli tells his story with tender precision , and never an awkward moment . " Ebert listed it among the top five foreign films of 2007 . According to Laura Kern from The New York Times , the film " is a coming @-@ of @-@ age tale that is engrossing , if slightly overlong , and absolutely timeless , unfolding against an antiquated class system that sadly stands firm in rural areas of India to this day . " 
 A review in Variety called it " a film that touches the heartstrings as it brings home the cruel class distinctions that poison Indian <unk> , " and said it " is more than a children 's film , despite revolving around a central character of 14 . Its social message , linked to the story of a poor farm girl who aspires to be a dancer , never feels forced , and the moral issues it depicts are realistically complex . " Commenting on its commercial feasibility , the review concluded that " while that might not translate into obvious box office potential , art house appeal is there for distributors willing to seek out a market . " The Chicago Tribune wrote : 
 It 's a touching , believable , often funny but ultimately sad tale of how one class can take advantage of another , even in the guise of patronizing benevolence . Though sometimes shifting abruptly in time , Vanaja is an arresting story of modern @-@ day hardship and class exploitation , recalling Charles Dickens as well as Western fairy @-@ tale lore . Domalpalli 's settings are ultra @-@ real in detail and color , from the crude , almost feudal deprivations of Vanaja 's dirt @-@ floor background to the stately rituals and autocratic entitlement of the well @-@ to @-@ do . 
 Speaking of Bhukya 's performance , the San Francisco Chronicle writes , " Bhukya delivers an entrancing and natural performance , deftly balancing both the wide @-@ eyed childishness of a young girl with the dawning awareness of life 's darker possibilities . She 's also an accomplished dancer , which she proves at several points in the film . " It adds , " can this wonder @-@ filled film truly be not only Domalpalli 's first feature , but originally part of a thesis submission at Columbia University ? Both in the film 's writing and direction , Domalpalli displays maturity , wisdom and a loving sense of visual and character detail . " Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle proclaimed , " director Domalpalli , who , with his debut feature , turned in what may well be the best Columbia University master 's thesis ever . " The Hartford Courant also claimed like the Chicago Tribune that the film would remind the Western audience of Charles Dickens , and further stated that it " ... gives a detailed sense of place and shows a mastery of story telling . The themes of fate and class resonate and the work of the amateur players is remarkably moving . " 
 Despite the generally positive reception , some critics differed in their opinion of the content and depiction . The New York Post criticised the film saying that " there 's enough mush in the Indian melodrama Vanaja to fill an entire season of a TV soap opera , " adding that toward its ending , the " viewers will be bored stiff by ( the ) long , tedious film " . Though the " narrative meanders ... [ it ] evokes village life with stark authenticity , " said a review by Time Out . 
 = New York and New Jersey campaign = 
 The New York and New Jersey campaign was a series of battles for control of New York City and the state of New Jersey in the American Revolutionary War between British forces under General Sir William Howe and the Continental Army under General George Washington in 1776 and the winter months of 1777 . Howe was successful in driving Washington out of New York City , but overextended his reach into New Jersey , and ended the active campaign season in January 1777 with only a few outposts near the city . The British held New York harbor for the rest of the war , using it as a base for expeditions against other targets . 
 First landing unopposed on Staten Island on July 3 , 1776 , Howe assembled an army composed of elements that had been withdrawn from Boston in March following their failure to hold that city , combined with additional British troops , as well as Hessian troops rented from several German principalities . Washington had New England soldiers as well as regiments from states as far south as Virginia . Landing on Long Island in August , Howe defeated Washington in the largest battle of the war , but the Continental Army was able to retreat to Manhattan under cover of darkness and fog . Washington suffered a series of defeats in Manhattan , with the exception of a victory at Harlem Heights , but was nevertheless chased north to White Plains , New York . At that point Howe returned to Manhattan to capture forces Washington had left in the north of that island . 
 Washington and much of his army crossed the Hudson River into New Jersey , and retreated all the way across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania , shrinking due to ending enlistment periods , desertions , and poor morale . Howe ordered his troops into winter quarters in December , establishing a chain of outposts from New York to Burlington , New Jersey . Washington , in a tremendous boost to American morale , launched a successful strike against the Trenton garrison after crossing the icy Delaware River , prompting Howe to withdraw his chain of outposts back to New Brunswick and the coast near New York , while Washington established his winter camp at Morristown . During the remaining winter months , both sides skirmished frequently as the British sought forage and provisions . 
 Britain maintained control of New York City and some of the surrounding territory until the war ended in 1783 , using it as a base for operations elsewhere in North America . In 1777 , General Howe launched a campaign to capture Philadelphia , leaving General Sir Henry Clinton in command of the New York area , while General John Burgoyne led an attempt to gain control of the Hudson River valley from Quebec that failed at Saratoga . Northern New Jersey was the scene of skirmishing between the opposing forces for the rest of the war .

 When the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775 , British troops were under siege in Boston . They defeated Patriot forces in the Battle of Bunker Hill , suffering very high casualties . When news of this expensive British victory reached London , General William Howe and Lord George Germain , the British official responsible , determined that a " decisive action " should be taken against New York City using forces recruited from throughout the British Empire as well as troops hired from small German states . 
 General George Washington , recently named by the Second Continental Congress as the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Continental Army , echoed the sentiments of others that New York was " a post of infinite importance " , and began the task of organizing military companies in the New York area when he stopped there on his way to take command of the siege of Boston . In January 1776 Washington ordered Charles Lee to raise troops and take command of New York 's defenses . Lee had made some progress on the city 's defenses when word arrived in late March 1776 that the British army had left Boston after Washington threatened them from heights south of the city . Concerned that General Howe was sailing directly to New York , Washington hurried regiments from Boston , including General Israel Putnam , who commanded the troops until Washington himself arrived in mid @-@ April . At the end of April , Washington dispatched General John Sullivan with six regiments to the north to bolster the faltering Quebec campaign . 
 General Howe , rather than moving against New York , withdrew his army to Halifax , Nova Scotia , and regrouped while transports full of British troops , shipped from bases around Europe and intended for New York , began gathering at Halifax . In June he set sail for New York with the 9 @,@ 000 men assembled there , before all of the transports arrived . German troops , primarily from Hesse @-@ Kassel , as well as British troops from Henry Clinton 's ultimately unsuccessful expedition to the Carolinas , were to meet with Howe 's fleet when it reached New York . General Howe 's brother , Admiral Lord Howe , arrived at Halifax with further transports after the general sailed , and immediately followed . 
 When General Howe arrived in the outer harbor of New York , the ships began sailing up the undefended Narrows between Staten Island and Long island on July 2 , and started landing troops on the undefended shores of Staten Island that day . Washington learned from prisoners taken that Howe had landed 10 @,@ 000 men , but was awaiting the arrival of another 15 @,@ 000 . General Washington , with a smaller army of about 19 @,@ 000 effective troops , lacked significant intelligence on the British force and plans , and was uncertain exactly where in the New York area the Howes intended to strike . He consequently split the Continental Army between fortified positions on Long Island , Manhattan and other mainland locations , and also established a " Flying Camp " in northern New Jersey . This was intended as a reserve force that could support operations anywhere along the Jersey shore of the Hudson . 
 = = Capture of New York City = = 
 The Howe brothers had been granted authority as peace commissioners by Parliament , with limited powers to pursue a peaceful resolution to the conflict . King George III was not optimistic about the possibility of a peace , " yet I think it right to be attempted , whilst every act of vigour is unremittingly carried on " . Their powers were limited to granting of " general and special pardons " and to " confer with any of his Majesty 's subjects " . On July 14 , pursuant to these powers , Admiral Howe sent a messenger with a letter addressed to " George Washington , Esq . " across the harbor . Washington 's adjutant , Joseph Reed , politely informed the messenger that no person with that title was in their army . Admiral Howe 's aide wrote that " the <unk> of an Address " should not have prevented the letter 's delivery , and Howe was said to be visibly annoyed by the rejection . A second request , addressed to " George Washington , Esq . , etc . " was similarly rejected , although the messenger was told that Washington would receive one of Howe 's adjutants . In that fruitless meeting , held July 20 , Washington pointed out that the limited powers the Howe brothers had been given were not of much use , as the rebels had done no wrong requiring an amnesty . 
 In late August , the British transported about 22 @,@ 000 men ( including 9 @,@ 000 Hessians ) from Staten Island to Long Island . In the Battle of Long Island on August 27 , 1776 , the British outflanked the American positions , driving the Americans back to their Brooklyn Heights fortifications . General Howe then began to lay siege to the works , but Washington skillfully managed a nighttime retreat through his unguarded rear across the East River to Manhattan Island . Howe then paused to consolidate his position and consider his next move . 
 During the battle , the British had captured General John Sullivan . Admiral Howe convinced him to deliver a message to Congress in Philadelphia , and released him on parole . Washington also gave his permission , and on September 2 Sullivan told the Congress that the Howes wanted to negotiate , and had been given much broader powers to treat than those they actually held . This created a diplomatic problem for Congress , which did not want to be seen as aggressive , which is how some representatives felt a direct rejection of the appeal would appear . Consequently , Congress agreed to send a committee to meet with the Howes in a move they did not think would bear any fruit . On September 11 , the Howe brothers met with John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , and Edward Rutledge in the Staten Island Peace Conference . It had exactly the outcome the Americans expected . 
 During this time , Washington , who had previously been ordered by Congress to hold New York City , was concerned that he might have escaped one trap for another , since the army was still vulnerable to being surrounded on Manhattan . To keep his escape routes open to the north , he placed 5 @,@ 000 troops in the city ( which then only occupied the lower portion of Manhattan ) , and took the rest of the army to Harlem Heights . In the first recorded use of a submarine in warfare , he also attempted a novel attack on the Royal Navy , launching the Turtle in a failed attempt to sink the HMS Eagle , Admiral Howe 's flagship . 
 On September 15 , General Howe landed about 12 @,@ 000 men on lower Manhattan , quickly taking control of New York City . The Americans withdrew to Harlem , where they skirmished the next day , but held their ground . Rather than attempting to dislodge Washington from his strong position a second time , Howe again opted for a flanking maneuver . Landing troops with some opposition in October in Westchester County , he sought once again to encircle Washington . To defend against this move , Washington withdrew most of his army to White Plains , where after a short battle on October 28 he retreated further north . This isolated the remaining Continental Army troops in upper Manhattan , so Howe returned to Manhattan and captured Fort Washington in mid November , taking almost 3 @,@ 000 prisoners . 
 Four days later , November 20 , Fort Lee , across the Hudson River from Fort Washington , was also taken . Washington brought much of his army across the Hudson into New Jersey , but was immediately forced to retreat by the aggressive British advance . 
 General Howe , after consolidating British positions around New York harbor , detached 6 @,@ 000 men under the command of two of his more difficult subordinates , Henry Clinton , and Hugh , Earl Percy to take Newport , Rhode Island ( which they did without opposition on December 8 ) , while he sent General Lord Cornwallis to chase Washington 's army through New Jersey . The Americans withdrew across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania in early December . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 The outlook of the Continental Army — and thus the revolution itself — was bleak . " These are the times that try men 's souls " , wrote Thomas Paine in The American Crisis . Washington 's army had dwindled to fewer than 5 @,@ 000 men fit for duty and would be significantly reduced after enlistments expired at the end of the year . Spirits were low , popular support was wavering , and Congress had abandoned Philadelphia , fearing a British attack . Washington ordered some of the troops that returned from the failed invasion of Quebec to join him , and also ordered General Lee 's troops , which he had left north of New York City , to join him . Lee , whose relationship with Washington was at times difficult , made excuses and only traveled as far as Morristown , New Jersey . When Lee strayed too far from his army on December 12 , his exposed position was betrayed by Loyalists , and a British company led by Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton surrounded the inn where he was staying and took him prisoner . Lee 's command was taken over by John Sullivan , who finished marching the army to Washington 's camp across the river from Trenton . 
 The capture of Lee presented the Howes with a problematic prisoner . As with a number of other Continental Army leaders , he had previously served in the British Army . Because of this the Howes at first treated him as a deserter , with threats of military punishment . However , Washington intervened , tying the treatment of Lee to the treatment of prisoners he held . Lee was ultimately treated well , and apparently offered the British commanders advice on how to win the war . Because the Americans did not have a prisoner of comparable rank , Lee remained a prisoner in New York until 1778 , when was exchanged for Richard Prescott . 
 The failure of the Continental Army to hold New York also brought about a rise in Loyalist activity , as the city became a haven for refugee supporters of the Crown from elsewhere across the country . The British actively recruited in New York and New Jersey to build regiments of provincial militia , with some success . Loyalists in these areas may have been motivated by seeing elements of the rebel army head home after their enlistments ended . One New York Patriot militia leader wrote that thirty of his men , rather than reenlisting with him , had instead signed up with the enemy . On November 30 Admiral Howe offered amnesty to anyone that had taken up arms against the Crown , provided they swore an oath to it . Washington responded with his own proclamation suggesting that those who did not renounce such oaths should immediately go behind British lines . As a result , New Jersey became a civil battlefield , with militia activity as well as spying and <unk> continuing for the rest of the war . 
 News of the capture of New York was favorably received in London , and General Howe was awarded the Order of the Bath for his work . Combined with news of the recovery of Quebec , circumstances suggested to British leaders that the war could be ended with one more year 's campaigning . News of Admiral Howe 's amnesty proclamation was met with some surprise , as its terms were more lenient than the hardliners in the government expected . Politicians opposed to the war pointed out that the proclamation failed to mention the primacy of the Parliament . Furthermore , the Howes were criticized for failing to keep Parliament informed of the various peace efforts they embarked on . 
 = = Howe 's strategy = = 
 With the campaign at an apparent conclusion for the season , the British established a chain of outposts stretching from Perth Amboy to Bordentown and entered winter quarters . They controlled much of New York and New Jersey and were in a good position to resume operations in the spring , with the rebel capital of Philadelphia in striking distance . Howe detached General Clinton with 6 @,@ 000 men to occupy Newport , Rhode Island as a base for future operations against Boston and Connecticut ( Clinton occupied Newport in early December without opposition . ) Howe then sketched a campaign for the following year in a letter to Lord Germain : 10 @,@ 000 men at Newport , 10 @,@ 000 for an expedition to Albany ( to meet an army descending from Quebec ) , 8 @,@ 000 to cross New Jersey and threaten Philadelphia , and 5 @,@ 000 to defend New York . If additional foreign forces were available , operations could also be considered against the southern states . 
 = = Washington 's counterstrike = = 
 While worrying over how to hold his army together , Washington organized attacks on the relatively exposed British outposts , which were as a result continually on edge due to ongoing militia and army raids . German commanders Carl von Donop and Johann Rall , whose brigades were at the end of the chain of outposts , were frequent targets of these raids , but their repeated warnings and requests for support from General James Grant were dismissed . 
 Beginning in mid @-@ December , Washington planned a two @-@ pronged attack on Rall 's outpost in Trenton , with a third diversionary attack on Donop 's outpost in Bordentown . The plan was aided by the fortuitous presence of a militia company that drew Donop 's entire 2 @,@ 000 @-@ man force away from Bordentown to the south that resulted in a skirmish at Mount Holly on December 23 . The consequence of this action was that Donop was not in a position to assist Rall when Washington 's attack on Trenton took place . On the night of December 25 – 26 , Washington and 2 @,@ 400 men stealthily crossed the Delaware and surprised Rall 's outpost the following morning , killing or capturing nearly 1 @,@ 000 Hessians . This action not only significantly boosted the army 's morale ; it also brought Cornwallis out of New York . He reassembled an army of more than 6 @,@ 000 men , and marched most of them against a position Washington had taken south of Trenton . Leaving a garrison of 1 @,@ 200 at Princeton , Cornwallis then attacked Washington 's position on January 2 , 1777 , and was three times repulsed before darkness set in . During the night Washington once again stealthily moved his army , going around that of Cornwallis with the intention of attacking the Princeton garrison . 
 Hugh Mercer , leading the American advance guard , encountered British soldiers from Princeton under the command of Charles Mawhood . The British troops engaged Mercer and in the ensuing battle , Mercer was mortally wounded . Washington sent reinforcements under General John Cadwalader , which were successful in driving Mawhood and the British from Princeton , with many of them fleeing to Cornwallis in Trenton . The British lost more than one quarter of their force in the battle , and American morale rose with the victory . 
 The defeats convinced General Howe to withdraw most of his army from New Jersey , only leaving outposts at New Brunswick and Perth Amboy . Washington entered winter quarters at Morristown , having retaken most of the state from the British . However , provisions for both armies were limited , and commanders on both sides sent out parties to forage for food and other supplies . For the next few months , they engaged in a forage war , in which each targeted the foraging parties of the other . This led to numerous skirmishes and minor confrontations including the Battle of Millstone . The British also sniped with each other over the subject of provisions . Lord Percy resigned his command after a series of disagreements with Howe came to a head over the ability of the Newport station to provide forage to the New York and New Jersey forces . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The British gained control of New York harbor and the surrounding agricultural areas , and held New York City and Long Island until the war ended in 1783 . The Americans suffered significant casualties and lost important supplies , but Washington managed to retain the core of his army and avoid a decisive confrontation that could have ended the war . With the bold strokes of Trenton and Princeton , he had regained initiative and boosted morale . The areas around New York City in New York , New Jersey , and Connecticut were an ongoing battleground for the rest of the war . 
 The early reports that General Howe sent to his superiors in London concerning the battles at Trenton and Princeton attempted to minimize their significance , blaming Rall for Trenton , and trying to recast Princeton as a nearly successful defense . Not everyone was fooled by his accounts , in particular Lord Germain . In a letter to the Hessian General Leopold Philip von Heister Germain wrote that " the officer who commanded [ the forces at Trenton ] and to whom this misfortune is to be attributed has lost his life by his rashness . " Heister in turn had to report the loss to his ruler , Frederick II , Landgrave of Hesse @-@ Kassel , with the news that not only had an entire brigade been lost , but sixteen regimental colors and six cannon as well . The news reportedly enraged Frederick , who broadly suggested that Heister return home ( which he did , turning over command of the Hessian forces to Wilhelm von Knyphausen ) . Frederick also ordered extensive inquiries into the events of 1776 , that took place in New York from 1778 to 1782 . These inquiries created a unique archive of materials about the campaign . 
 The news of Washington 's successes reached Paris at a critical time . Britain 's ambassador to France , Lord Stormont , was preparing complaints to France 's foreign minister , the Comte de Vergennes , concerning the semi @-@ secret financial and logistical support France had been giving to the rebels . Stormont had learned that supplies bound for America were to be shipped under French flags , where they had previously sent under American colors . He wrote that the French court was extremely happy with the news , and that the French diplomatic position noticeably hardened : " that M. de Vergennes is hostile in his heart and anxious for the success of the Rebels I have not a shadow of a doubt . " 
 = = Next steps = = 
 The British planned two major operations for the 1777 campaign season . The first was an ambitious plan to gain control of the Hudson River valley , whose central thrust was a move along Lake Champlain by the army from Quebec under General John Burgoyne . Execution of this plan ultimately failed , ending with the surrender of Burgoyne 's army at Saratoga , New York , in October . The second operation was General Howe 's plan to take Philadelphia , which , after a difficult start , met with success in September . 
 Washington 's strategy in 1777 continued to be a basically defensive one . He successfully fended off an attempt by Howe to draw him into a general engagement in northern New Jersey , but was unable to prevent Howe 's later success taking Philadelphia . He did send material help to General Horatio Gates , who was tasked with defending against Burgoyne 's movements . Major General Benedict Arnold and Daniel Morgan 's riflemen all played a notable role in the defeat of Burgoyne , following which France entered the war .

 = Sauganash Hotel = 
 Sauganash Hotel ( originally Eagle Exchange Tavern ) is a former hotel ; regarded as the first hotel in Chicago , Illinois . It was located at Wolf Point in the present day Loop community area at the intersection of the north , south and main branches of the Chicago River . The location at West Lake Street and North Wacker Drive ( formerly Market Street ) was designated a Chicago Landmark on November 6 , 2002 . The hotel changed proprietors often in its twenty @-@ year existence and briefly served as Chicago 's first theater . It was named after Billy Caldwell , an interpreter in the British Indian Department . 
 = = History = = 
 Mark and Monique Beaubien , the owners and builders of the hotel , were French Indian traders . In 1826 they moved to Chicago on the advice of Mark 's brother Jean , who lived at Fort Dearborn . The <unk> settled in a small cabin on Wolf 's Point and continued their trade with the Indians . They built a tavern on the east bank of the south branch of the Chicago River at the point where the north and south branches meet . The tavern was named Eagle Exchange Tavern . In 1831 , they added a frame to the log structure to create Chicago 's first hotel , the Sauganash Hotel . When completed , it was one of only two residential structures on the south side of the main branch of the Chicago River , the other being that of Col. John B. Beaubien , Mark 's brother . The settlement had only twelve houses at the time . The hostelry immediately became famous , and when reconstructed later became the city 's largest and finest hotel . Immediately adjacent to the hotel 's public bar was Chicago 's first drug store . 
 The Greek Revival trim of the new hotel contrasted with the other eleven buildings of Chicago . The symmetry of its facade was typical to contemporary Greek Revival practiced on the East Coast . Juliette Kinzie , who came to Chicago from Connecticut in 1831 , described it as " a <unk> white two @-@ story building , with bright blue wood shutters , the admiration of all the little circle at Wolf Point " . The hostelry 's clientele transcended race , with natives and settlers enjoying each other 's company . 
 The flow of travelers and settlers intensified with the end of the Black Hawk War in 1832 . In 1833 the hotel housed election of the first town trustees of the newly formed Town of Chicago . Beaubien kept the Hotel until 1834 and during his ownership he regularly entertained guests with his violin . On August 18 , 1835 , two years after the Potawatomi natives signed the treaty agreeing to be moved to a reservation beyond the Mississippi River in northwestern Missouri , they selected 800 braves to perform their last war dance parade on a path that passed in front of the hotel . In 1835 , a Mr. Davis assumed control of the hotel , which subsequently had a series of proprietors . The building briefly served as Chicago 's first theater , and hosted the first Chicago Theatre company in November 1837 in an abandoned dining room . By 1839 , it returned to service as a hotel , but was destroyed by fire in 1851 , and subsequently torn down . The Wigwam was built in its place nine years later .

 Billy Caldwell " Sauganash " , who served as an interpreter for the Indian Agents , was the honoree of the hotel . Born in approximately 1780 , " Sauganash " was an Indian half @-@ breed , whose father was Colonel Caldwell , an Irish officer in the British Army stationed at Detroit ; his mother was a <unk> . He was schooled at a Jesuit school in Detroit , where he learned English and French . Caldwell learned several Indian dialects . Billy Caldwell 's Indian Name was " Straight Tree " , but he was known by " Sauganash " , meaning Englishman in the Potawatomi language . As a warrior , Sauganash was under the influence of Tecumseh until his death and he became a Captain in the British Indian Department .

 In 1834 ( three years before Chicago incorporated as a city ) , the hotel hosted the first professional public performance in Chicago at a cost of $ .50 ( $ 11 @.@ 85 today ) for adults and $ .25 for children . The show promised a wide variety of talents including ventriloquism . In the following two years , several traveling showmen performed at the hotel . In 1837 , the Chicago Theater , which was the first local theater company , set up shop in the hotel 's abandoned dining room . Co @-@ managers Harry Isherwood and Alexander McKinzie procured an amusement license for the company from the city council , and it began performing a different billed show every night starting in late October or early November for approximately six weeks . The plays included titles The Idiot Witness , The Stranger , and The Carpenter of Rouen . Production of The Stranger took place in the dining room of the hotel . Following a six @-@ week engagement , the company went on tour until the following spring , when it returned to a different local venue . 
 = Ed the Happy Clown = 
 Ed the Happy Clown is a graphic novel by Canadian cartoonist Chester Brown . Its title character is a large @-@ headed , childlike children 's clown who undergoes one horrifying affliction after another . The story in is a dark , humorous mix of genres and features scatological humour , sex , body horror , extreme graphic violence , and blasphemous religious imagery . Central to the plot are a man who cannot stop defecating ; the head of a miniature , other @-@ dimensional Ronald Reagan attached to the head of Ed 's penis ; and a female vampire who seeks revenge on her adulterous lover who had murdered her to escape his sins . 
 The surreal , largely improvised story began with a series of unrelated short strips that Brown went on to tie into a single narrative . Brown first serialized it in his comic book Yummy Fur , and the first , incomplete collected edition in 1989 , titled Ed the Happy Clown : A Yummy Fur Book . Shortly after , Brown became unsatisfied with the direction of the serial ; he brought it to an abrupt end in the eighteenth issue of Yummy Fur and turned to autobiography . A second edition titled Ed the Happy Clown : The Definitive Ed Book appeared in 1992 with an altered ending and most of the later parts of the series eliminated . The contents of this edition were re @-@ serialized with extensive endnotes in 2005 – 2006 as a nine @-@ issue Ed the Happy Clown series and collected as Ed the Happy Clown : A Graphic @-@ Novel in 2012 . 
 The story is seen by many critics as a highlight of the 1980s North American alternative comics scene . It has left an influence on contemporary alternative cartoonists such as Daniel Clowes , Seth , and Dave Sim , and has won a Harvey and other awards . Canadian film director Bruce McDonald has had the rights since 1991 to make an Ed movie , but the project has struggled to find financial backing . 
 = = Background = = 
 Brown grew up in Châteauguay , Quebec , a Montreal suburb with a large English @-@ speaking minority . He was an introverted youth attracted to comic books from a young age . He aimed at a career drawing superhero comics , but was unsuccessful in getting work with Marvel or DC Comics after graduating from high school . He moved to Toronto and discovered underground comix and the small @-@ press community . 
 By the early 1980s Marvel and DC had come to dominate comic @-@ book publishing in North America , and comic shops became the main places of purchase , with a clientele of dedicated comics fans . During this time , a trend towards greater ambition and expressiveness was developing on the fringes , such as Dave Sim 's long Cerebus series and the avant @-@ garde graphics magazine Raw in which the serialization of Art Spiegelman 's graphic novel Maus appeared . Brown was to find himself in the alternative comics scene that grew throughout the decade . 
 Brown was feeling himself in a creatively stagnant period when he came across a book on Surrealism : Wallace Fowley 's The Age of Surrealism ( 1950 ) . The book motivated Brown to work on an improvised minicomic series which he called Yummy Fur and self @-@ published from 1983 .

His bizarre misfortunes include having the tip of his penis replaced by the head of a miniature , talking Ronald Reagan from another universe . Ed 's adventures featured encounters with penis @-@ worshipping pygmies , flesh @-@ eating rats , Martians , Frankenstein 's monster , and other characters from traditional genre fiction . The story unfolds with a black @-@ comedic sensibility topped with Christian symbolism . Despite his ordeals — being imprisoned for a crime he did not commit , falling in love with a vampire — Ed remains a gentle , childlike innocent , with a Candide @-@ like optimism . The story has had more than one ending and is a challenge to summarize . 
 = = = Summary = = = 
 The children 's hospital Ed is about to visit burns down with all the children in it . A number of apparently unrelated short gag strips appear before Brown begins to tie the narrative together into one plot . 
 Ed is imprisoned when he finds hospital janitor Chet <unk> 's severed hand and the police assume Ed had taken it . In the prison a man is unable stop defecating and his faeces fill the jail , engulfing all , including Ed . When Ed emerges he finds the head of his penis replaced with the head of a miniature Ronald Reagan from Dimension X — a world much like Ed 's but whose people are tiny . Dimension X has dumped its waste into a trans @-@ dimensional portal , which turns out to be the anus of the man who could not stop defecating . Reagan 's body remains in Dimension X , and the professor who discovered the portal travels to Ed 's dimension to find the head , making contact with the authorities of Ed 's world . 
 Chet believes the loss of his hand is due to his unfaithfulness to his wife ; as a child his mother read Chet the story of a Saint Justin who cuts off his right hand to avoid sinning , and Chet assumes his lost hand is a like punishment from God . He tries to atone for it by killing his girlfriend , Josie , in the woods . Penis @-@ worshipping , rat @-@ eating pygmy cannibals drag the bodies of both Josie and Ed into the sewers . As they are about to sever Ed 's penis Josie reanimates in time to save him . The two attempt to escape from the sewers when they are accidentally shot by a mother – daughter team of pygmy hunters . Josie dies again , and her disembodied spirit learns from the ghost of Chet 's sister that she has become a vampire . 
 The professor from Dimension X and members of the staff of the Adventures in Science TV show find Ed and the President and bring them to the TV studio . The discovery is big news , and the professor and the President make a TV appearance . When it is discovered that the people of Dimension X are homosexual or bisexual the professor is put to a violent death , and Ed and the body of Josie are put in confinement . The studio is invaded by the pygmies when they recognize their " Penis God " on television . Josie 's spirit returns to her body , and she and Ed escape and make their way to the hospital where Chet works . Josie gets her revenge by seducing Chet and killing him before he is able to repent , thus sending him to Hell . 
 Ed is one of a number of men secretly kidnapped to provide another , Bick Backman , with a penis transplant — a larger one to please his wife . Out of the lineup of unconscious men , Ed 's penis with the President 's head on it stands out and is chosen for Backman . After the operation , Mounties raid the hospital and , finding Reagan , take Backman and leave Ed , who has had a larger penis sewn on in the President 's place . The hospital hands Ed over to Mrs Backman , claiming he is her husband . Though suspicious , she accepts Ed — and his newly transplanted penis .

 The ending that appeared in Yummy Fur has not appeared in book editions . In it , Mrs Backman takes Ed home , but her children are not convinced he is their father . After he spends some time in the house they decide " he 's way better than the other one " . There is a resemblance between Ed and Mrs Backman , and it is revealed they were twins separated at birth . While at church , the Backman children are kidnapped by stone aliens and are saved by Frankenstein 's monster , who brings them to Washington , D.C. where they find their kidnapped real father . Josie and Ed 's zombie friend rescues the <unk> . Ed has his clown makeup restored and reverts to his cheerful self . When he goes to visit Josie , he learns her apartment building has burned down , and she was the only casualty . Her charred skeleton is brought out , clutching an unburnt severed hand . 
 The alternate ending from the 1992 and later versions drops most of the story that follows Chet 's death , replacing it with 17 new pages . In this version , Chet 's severed hand visits Josie 's apartment at night and rolls up her window shade . As she is a vampire , the sunlight in the morning burns her to death while she sleeps , and she and Chet are reunited in the flames of Hell .

 Ed 
 A big @-@ headed , childlike clown with Candide @-@ like optimism , despite the hardships his creator puts him through . He is a passive protagonist to and around whom events occur . He spends much of the story with the head of a miniature Ronald Reagan from another dimension for a <unk> . He later discovers , after having the president severed from his penis and having a new one attached , that he has a long @-@ lost twin sister in Becky Backman . Brown considers Ed to be an " adult who 's pre @-@ adolescent " , whose sexuality is not fully formed . 
 Chet <unk> 
 A janitor working at a hospital , he is plagued with guilt over cheating on his wife after his hand falls off for no apparent reason . After having a dream in which a statue of the Virgin Mary turns into his girlfriend , Josie , and has sex with him , he murders Josie while having sex with her by stabbing her in the back in the woods . Josie , who becomes a vampire afterwards , hunts him down and eventually breaks his neck , sending him to Hell . " Chet " is short for " Chester " , and Douglas Wolk sees Chet as perhaps a stand @-@ in for Brown himself , though Brown denies any autobiographical elements in the story . Brown has stated he had a phobia of losing his hand , as it would end his ability to draw , and so named the character " Chet " . 
 Josie 
 Chet 's beautiful former girlfriend , who becomes a vampire " for actively engaging in a grievous sin " for committing adultery with her boyfriend Chet , when he murders her by stabbing her in the back . Her vampire self ends up saving Ed from having his penis decapitated by pygmy cannibals , and eventually tracks down Chet and kills him , sending him to Hell . In an alternate ending , she finds herself in Hell as well , eternally embracing Chet while being consumed by fire . 
 Ronald Reagan 
 Though bearing the American president 's name and position , the diminutive Reagan bears no resemblance to his namesake . He comes from Dimension X , and his head becomes attached to the end of Ed 's penis after falling into an interdimensional portal . The president 's body remains in Dimension X , where people are much smaller than in Ed 's , and are homosexual . 
 Brown had intended to use Ed Broadbent , a left @-@ wing politician of the Canadian New Democratic Party ( NDP ) , but changed it to the right @-@ wing Reagan as he believed Broadbent would have been too obscure to his American readers . He later regretted the decision and said he could have included an explanation . The idea of a talking penis has appeared in a number of other comics , such as The Talking Head ( 1990 ) by Paolo <unk> and Pete <unk> @-@ Garner 's Young Tim . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 Ed spans a range of Brown 's interests , from political skepticism to scatological humour to vampires and werewolves . The story is dark and surreal , desperate and humorous . 
 Christian elements especially — largely <unk> — are prominent in the book . They are at first innocuous and unimportant : a zombie named Christian , another character who believes he has found Christ 's face on a piece of adhesive tape . With the fourth issue of Yummy Fur , Brown 's surreal take on Christianity becomes central : the cover depicts the Virgin Mary holding not just the infant Christ , but also a severed hand . Within is the story of Saint Justin , whose amputation becomes a key motif : Chet loses his own hand and finds another ; his own appears mysteriously under Ed 's pillow . Only by praying for forgiveness for his adultery and by murdering his lover is Chet 's hand miraculously restored . According to the Lives of the Saints , the fictional Saint Justin severed his own hand , but in another version Brown presents , Justin 's wife cuts it off with a <unk> when she catches her husband masturbating after rejecting her advances . The altered ending from 1992 has both Josie and Chet reunited in Hell , and the ghost of Chet 's sister becomes a devil . As Brown mixes surreal sacrilege with the sort of moralism that compels him to condemn Josie for her bloody revenge , Brian Evenson calls Brown " deft at muddying the waters in a way that makes it very hard to pin him down as either <unk> or satirist , as either anti @-@ <unk> or apologist " . 
 While not part of the Ed story , Brown had been serializing straight adaptations in Yummy Fur of the Gospels of Mark and of Matthew during most of Ed 's run . R. Fiore called these adaptations " the best exploration of Christian mythology since Justin Green 's Binky Brown " , comparing Chet 's excessive Christian guilt with the " almost childlike retelling " of Mark . Yummy Fur readers also found " I Live in the Bottomless Pit " , a short strip in which a man discovers the Antichrist , who after millennia underground has forgotten his mission — a paradoxical one , as he states his orders were from God . 
 Ed prominently features transgressive content including nudity , graphic violence , racist imagery , blasphemy , and profanity . Brown grew up in a strictly Baptist household in which he was not allowed to swear , as depicted in Brown 's graphic novel I Never Liked You ( 1994 ) . Brown challenged his own anxieties by tackling subjects such as scatological humour . Imagery such as the recurring Pygmy characters and their " <unk> <unk> " language , Chris Lanier asserted , reinforce " old colonial imaging of ' third world natives ' " . 
 = = Style = = 
 According to comics historian John Bell , " Brown arrived in print almost fully formed as an artist " . His style , while showing the influence of artists such as Robert Crumb , Harold Gray , and Jack Kirby , was distinct from his predecessors . He continued to mature as an artist and draughtsman throughout the run of Ed , showing enormous growth from the beginning to end of the graphic novel . 
 Unlike most cartoonists , Brown does not compose his pages , but draws each panel on separate sheets of paper and assembles them into pages afterwards . The panels in Ed were on 5 @-@ by @-@ 5 @-@ inch ( 13 cm × 13 cm ) squares of cheap typewriter paper , which he placed on a block of wood on his lap in lieu of a drawing board . He used a number of different drawing tools , including Rapidograph technical pens , markers , <unk> pens and ink brushes . He had some photocopies printed from his pencilled work , which he found both faster to produce and more spontaneous in feel . 
 Brown worked freely , without ruling lines or lettering . Usually he roughly sketched the artwork with a light blue pencil , then elaborated it with an HB pencil , at which stage he has said " most of the work [ was ] done " . Brown inked the pre @-@ Vortex stories with a brush ; when he committed himself to a regular schedule , he felt inking with a brush would be too slow , and switched to cheap markers or pencils to increase his productivity . He continued to use a brush to fill in blacks and to letter his dialogue balloons . Brown came to favour the quality of the brush again toward the end of the story 's run , but found it slow to work with and thus used it less than he would have preferred . By photocopying before sending the artwork to the printer , Brown could ensure that the copy printed from was sufficiently black . 
 While he occasionally scripted certain pages or scenes , more frequently he did not , and often wrote dialogue only after having drawn the artwork . Brown did not plan out the stories , though he might have certain ideas prepared . Some ideas he found carried him for up to two to three issues of Yummy Fur . Brown used of flashback scenes different perspectives to alter the story to his needs — for example , when Brown revisited the scene of Josie 's murder , he placed Ed behind a bush , linking the two characters ' fates . When he had originally done the murder scene , he says he did not " know that Ed was over in the bushes a couple feet away " . 
 Brown found himself dissatisfied with much of the work , and later abandoning about a hundred printed pages which he intends not to have reprinted . He found that the improvisational method did not work well with Underwater in the 1990s ; after cancelling that series he turned to carefully scripting out his stories , beginning with Louis Riel . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 When Brown started Ed , he was largely influenced by the comics he had grown up with , especially monster stories from Marvel Comics such as Werewolf by Night and Frankenstein 's Monster by artists such as Mike Ploog , and from DC Comics such as Swamp Thing by artists such as Bernie Wrightson and Jim <unk> . 
 Since graduating from high school , Brown had been inching towards underground comix , starting with the work of Richard Corben and especially Moebius in Heavy Metal , and eventually getting over his disgust over Robert Crumb 's sex @-@ laden comics to become a huge fan of the Zap and Weirdo artist . He says the book that finally pulled him over into the underground was The Apex Treasury of Underground Comics , which included Crumb as well as Art Spiegelman 's original short " Maus " story . He was also affected by Will Eisner 's graphic novel , A Contract with God . Brown had already been an Eisner fan , but this book was different , " something that wasn 't about a character with a mask on his face " . He started drawing in a more underground style , and submitting work to Raw , Last Gasp and Fantagraphics . The work was rejected from these publishers for one reason or another , and Brown was eventually convinced by his friend Kris Nakamura , who was active in the Toronto small press scene , to take it and self @-@ publish it . His minicomic , Yummy Fur , was the result , and included the earliest instalments of the Ed the Happy Clown story . 
 The book also drew inspiration from pulp science fiction , religious literature and television clichés . Harold Gray 's comic strip Little Orphan Annie had an effect on Brown after he discovered some Annie reprint books in the early 1980s . This was to be a primary influence on later work of Brown 's such as Louis Riel .

 The story began in July 1983 in the second issue of Brown 's original Yummy Fur minicomic , the seven issues of which were reprinted in 1986 – 87 in the first three issues of the Vortex Comics @-@ published Yummy Fur . Ed ran in the first eighteen issues of Yummy Fur , along other features , such as Brown 's Gospel adaptations . Brown envisioned Ed as an ongoing character in the vein of Marvel and DC comic @-@ book characters . In the late 1980s he came to feel restricted by the character ; inspired by the revealing autobiographical work of Julie Doucet and Joe Matt and the simple cartooning of fellow Toronto cartoonist Seth , Brown turned to autobiography . 
 While Ed was the main feature of Yummy Fur until Brown switched to autobiographical comics in 1990 , it was juxtaposed against straight adaptations of the gospels of Mark and Matthew , which filled up the rest of the Yummy Fur issues starting with issue # 4 . 
 In 2004 Brown set to work on a revised Ed ; he pencilled a number of pages , but stopped when he came to believe the new version was no better than the original . Drawn and Quarterly — Brown 's publisher since 1991 — reissued the contents of the Definitive Ed collection in a nine issue series on smaller @-@ sized pages from 2005 to 2006 titled Ed the Happy Clown , with new covers , previously unpublished art and extensive commentary by Brown . The contents came mainly from issues two through twelve , and some from issue seventeen . About 80 pages — a third of the original Ed material — remains uncollected , including the entire 24 @-@ page ending that appeared in issue eighteen . 
 The first collection , Ed the Happy Clown : A Yummy Fur Book , appeared in 1989 from Vortex Comics before Brown decided to end the story . It collects the Ed stories up to the twelfth issue of Yummy Fur and includes a cartoon foreword scripted by Harvey Pekar and drawn by Brown . It was this edition that in 1990 won Brown one of his two Harvey Awards , for Best Graphic Album , and a UK Comic Art Award the same year for Best Graphic Novel / Collection . 
 The second edition came from Vortex in 1992 , after Brown had taken Yummy Fur to Drawn and Quarterly . Bill Marks had it labelled The Definitive Ed Book for marketing reasons . The edition reprinted what was in the first edition with an altered ending and some material from Yummy Fur # 17 , and excluded most of the material in the series from after Chet 's death . 
 In June 2012 , Drawn and Quarterly published a third edition , Ed the Happy Clown : A Graphic @-@ Novel , reprinting the contents of the Ed series of a few years earlier , including somewhat modified endnotes and annotations . It had a new introduction by Brown , replacing those by Pekar and Solomos in the previous editions . Compared to those editions , it was printed on higher @-@ quality paper with higher contrast in the printing , and the artwork was reduced in size . Brown subtitled the book with a hyphen : " graphic @-@ novel " . This reflects Brown 's distaste yet reluctant acceptance of the term , as its usage had by then become widespread . Brian Evenson sees this as a Brown @-@ like eccentricity and a gesture emphasizing the equal importance Brown places on both word and image . The book was a bestseller . 
 The 2012 edition also included a ten @-@ page story called " The Door " , which Brown redrew from an anonymous public domain story from a horror comic book . In the story , a couple go through a door in a funhouse which leads through a passage in which they get lost for years . Their clothes disintegrate over that time , exposing their genitals , until they finally come across another door — one that leads them to Hell . Brown wrote he found the original story truly horrifying , as the couple had done nothing apparent to deserve their fate . He had originally intended to incorporate it into the Ed story , but capriciously veered off in another narrative direction . 
 The artwork appeared at its largest in the Vortex Yummy Fur issues ; it was somewhat smaller in the minicomics and first two collected editions . The artwork was smallest in the 2012 Drawn and Quarterly edition , a size Brown considered ideal , stating , " The smaller the better , as long as the words are still legible . " The 2012 edition also had wider page margins and gutters between the images . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Ed was seen by many critics a high point of the early alternative comics scene in the 1980s , echoes of which can be seen in such later surrealistic graphics novels as Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron by Daniel Clowes and Black Hole by Charles Burns . The story won praise from The Comics Journal and mainstream publications such as The Village Voice and Rolling Stone , which placed Ed on an early @-@ 1990s " Hot " list . Time placed Ed at seventh on its list of " All Time Top Ten Graphic Novels " , while publisher and critic Kim Thompson placed Ed 27th on his top 100 comics of the 20th Century , and editor and critic Tom Spurgeon called Ed " one of the three best alt @-@ comix serials of all time " . The book appeared in Gene Kannenberg 's 500 Essential Graphic Novels ( 2008 ) . 
 Ed had a large impact on a number of Brown 's contemporaries , including fellow Canadians Dave Sim and Seth , the latter of whom was taken in by the <unk> of Brown 's storytelling , saying " Those brilliant sequences where he would show a situation and then return to it later from a different perspective , like the death of Josie , really blew me away " — and Dave Cooper , who called Ed " the most perfect book ever " . Others who cite Ed as an influence on their work include Daniel Clowes , Chris Ware , Craig Thompson , Matt Madden , Eric Reynolds and the Canadian cartoonists Alex Fellows , whose Canvas shows the influence of Ed , and Bryan Lee O 'Malley , who calls Brown " a Golden God " and whose Lost at Sea was heavily influenced by Ed . Anders Nilsen calls Ed " completely amazing and one of the best comics ever " , placing it in his top five comic books , and citing it as a major influence on his spontaneous Big Questions . 
 Critic Chris Lanier placed Ed in a tradition that included Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron , Max Andersson 's Pixy , and Eric Drooker 's Flood ! ; he wrote that symbols appear with such frequency and importance in these works as to suggest significance , while remaining symbolically empty . He finds predecessors for these works in German Dada and the Theatre of the Absurd . Reviewer Brad McKay found Ed " both hopeless and funny , a trick moviemakers like Tim Burton and Todd Solondz wish they could pull off more regularly " . 
 D. Aviva Rothschild likened the story to " staring at six @-@ day @-@ old roadkill " . Brown 's father was too offended to keep reading after the fifth minicomic issue , " Ed and the Beanstalk " . 
 In Yummy Fur # 4 , there was a scene in which a fictional " Saint Justin " masturbates after putting off his wife 's advances . In one panel " Saint Justin " had just ejaculated all over his hand , his penis in full view and his semen @-@ covered hand clearly visible behind it . Vortex publisher Bill Marks had the panel covered up with another illustration after discussing it with Brown . Brown agreed to this censorship , but was " annoyed " by it . Marks later called it a mistake that he would not make again , and when Brown included a scene in the following issue of the Ronald Reagan <unk> vomiting Marks made no objection , and all future collections of Ed have the original uncensored panel . The censored portion of the panel was covered with a note delivered by a rabbit that Brown often used as a surrogate self ; the message read : 
 " Sorry folks but this picture of a penis ejaculating onto a hand has been censored . If any of you want to see this page as I originally drew it send me a self addressed envelope ( and an age statement ) care of Vortex Comics and I 'll send you a photocopy . " 
 Brown has said that perhaps 100 to 200 readers sent requests for the uncensored panel . 
 In stores , Yummy Fur was often wrapped in plastic with " adults only " labels on it . It is not known if Ed or Yummy Fur were banned from any stores , but Diamond , the largest American comics distributor , stopped carrying it for a time in 1988 . A publisher discovered that boxes of its feminist publication were lined with discarded pages of Yummy Fur , included pages in which Chet stabs Josie while having sex with her . The publisher lodged a complaint with the Ontario @-@ based printer , which informed Vortex it would no longer handle Yummy Fur . The third issue of the Drawn and Quarterly Ed series was seized at the Canadian border , but was later deemed admissible . 
 Critic R. Fiore initially found the 1992 ending disappointing , but changed his mind 2012 , saying the sad ending gave Ed " an emotional punch that it wouldn 't otherwise have " . Cartoonists such as Craig Thompson at first found the story off @-@ putting , but later came to admire it . Critic Douglas Wolk wrote that it is not surprising that Brown had not settled on one conclusion to the story , as that " would mean some kind of narrative closure " , while Ed 's premise is that " everything makes sense as a big picture eventually , but nothing can be relied on from moment to moment " . 
 In 2014 , <unk> Books published Ed Vs . Yummy Fur Brian Evenson . The book details the differences between the various versions of the Ed narrative .

 Canadian filmmaker Bruce McDonald has had the rights since 1991 to adapt Ed to film , for which he has planned to use Yummy Fur as the title . Such a film could use stop @-@ motion animation , but the project has yet to get off the ground . At one point McDonald hoped to have Macaulay Culkin star as Ed , Rip Torn as Ronald Reagan and Drew Barrymore as Nancy Reagan . In 2000 , it was reported that the movie would have a budget of $ 6 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , but it was unable to get the financial backing . A script was written by Don McKellar , and later with John Frizzell . 
 The City of Toronto commissioned Brown to do as part of their Live with Culture campaign ; the strip in Now magazine for six weeks in 2007 . In one episode a zombie and his human girlfriend attend a screening of McDonald 's still @-@ unmade adaptation of Ed . The same year , McDonald placed Brown 's graphic novel in scenes in his film The Tracey Fragments .

 = Lilioid monocots = 
 Lilioid monocots ( lilioids , <unk> monocots , petaloid monocots , petaloid lilioid monocots ) is an informal name used for a grade ( grouping of taxa with common characteristics ) of five monocot orders ( Petrosaviales , Dioscoreales , Pandanales , Liliales and Asparagales ) in which the majority of species have flowers with relatively large , coloured tepals . This characteristic is similar to that found in lilies ( " lily @-@ like " ) . <unk> monocots refers to the flowers having tepals which all resemble petals ( petaloid ) . The taxonomic terms Lilianae or Liliiflorae have also been applied to this assemblage at various times . From the early nineteenth century many of the species in this group of plants were put into a very broadly defined family , Liliaceae sensu lato or s.l. ( lily family ) . These classification systems are still found in many books and other sources . Within the monocots the Liliaceae s.l. were distinguished from the Glumaceae . 
 The development of molecular phylogenetics , cladistic theory and phylogenetic methods in the 1990s resulted in a dismemberment of the Liliaceae and its subsequent redistribution across three lilioid orders ( Liliales , Asparagales and Dioscoreales ) . Subsequent work has shown that two other more recently recognized orders , Petrosaviales and Pandanales also segregate with this group , resulting in the modern concept of five constituent orders within the lilioid monocot assemblage . This has resulted in treating monocots as three informal groups , alismatid , lilioid and commelinid monocots . The lilioids are paraphyletic in the sense that commelinids form a sister group to Asparagales . 
 = = Description = = 
 = = = True lilioids = = = 
 The descriptive term " petaloid lilioid monocot " relates to the conspicuous petal @-@ like ( petaloid ) tepals which superficially resemble true lilies ( Lilium ) . Morphologically , the petaloid or lilioid monocots can be considered to possess five groups ( <unk> ) of three @-@ fold ( trimerous ) whorls . Lilioid monocots all have flowers which can be considered to have been derived from a lily @-@ like flower with six relatively similar tepals , and six stamens . The typical lilioid <unk> has three carpels fused into a superior trilocular ( three @-@ chambered ) superior ovary , axile placentation , a single hollow style , and several ovules with <unk> orientation in one or two rows per locule and nectaries at the base . 
 However , floral synapomorphy ( shared characteristics ) is rare since most conform to the general monocot pattern . This pattern is ancestral ( plesiomorphic ) for the lilioid monocots . Structural <unk> is rare , except for Orchidaceae . 
 Various trends are apparent among the lilioids , notably a change to an inferior ovary and a reduction of the number of stamens to three . In some groups ( such as the genus Trillium in the Liliaceae ) , the tepals have become clearly differentiated , so that the flower has three coloured petals and three smaller green sepals . Almost all lilioid monocots retain at least three petal @-@ like tepals . Since some commelinids ( e.g. <unk> ) have petaloid flowers , the term ' lilioid ' is a more accurate one for the group which excludes them , since the term petaloid monocot is still occasionally used in describing commelinids . The morphological concept of petaloid monocots has been equated with " animal @-@ attracting " ( that is , for pollination ) as opposed to wind @-@ pollinating plants ( such as grasses ) that have evolved very different floral structures . Pollen structure shows that of the two main tapetum types , secretory and plasmodial , the lilioid monocots are nearly all secretory . 
 = = = Comparison with other monocot orders = = = 
 In the orders that branched off before the lilioid monocots , the Acorales and Alismatales , flowers differ in several ways . In some cases , like Acorus ( Acorales ) , they have become insignificant . In others , like Butomus ( Alismatales ) , they have six coloured tepals , and so could be called ' petaloid ' , but stamens and carpels are more numerous than in the lilioid monocots . 
 The later evolved commelinids have various kinds of flower , few of which are ' lily @-@ like ' . In the order <unk> , comprising grasses , rushes and sedges , flowers are either petal @-@ less or have small , unshowy petals . Many <unk> species have brightly coloured and showy flowers . However , their apparent structure is misleading . For example , the six tepals of <unk> are small and hidden under expanded and brightly coloured stamens or staminodes which resemble petals and may be mistaken for them .

 = = = Morphological definitions = = = 
 In one of the earliest monocot taxonomies , that of John Lindley ( 1830 ) , the grouping corresponding to the lilioid monocots was the " tribe " Petaloideae . In Lindley 's system the monocots consisted of two tribes , the Petaloideae , and the Glumaceae ( the grasses and sedges ) . Lindley divided the Petaloideae into 32 " orders " ( roughly corresponding to families ) and the Glumaceae into two further orders . Various successive taxonomies of the monocots also emphasized the grouping of species with petaloid ( undifferentiated ) perianths , such as Bentham and Hooker 's <unk> and Hutchinson 's <unk> ( " Corolla bearing " ) ( 1936 ) . Hence the concept that there was a natural grouping of monocots whose flowers were predominantly petaloid , gave notion to the term " petaloid monocots " . The core group of <unk> were the Liliaceae , hence " lilioid monocots " . 
 The term " lilioid monocot " or lilioid " has had widely varying interpretations . One of the narrower applications is " lily @-@ like " monocots , meaning the two orders Asparagales and Liliales , but the term has also been applied to <unk> 's superorder Lilianae , the whole of Liliales , or restricted to Cronquist 's broadly defined Liliaceae . Although " petaloid " and " lilioid " have often been used interchangeably , as Heywood points out , some usages of " petaloid monocot " , particularly in horticulture , are so broad as to be almost meaningless in that it had been used to refer to all species with conspicuous petals or perianth segments ( tepals ) , which would cover a broad swathe of families ( he estimated three dozen across many orders ) . Other authors have defined it equally broadly as " having two whorls of tepals ( sepals and petals ) that are petal @-@ like " . 
 As Kron and Chase stated in 1995 , this taxonomic unit had been in a considerable state of flux , with significant variation between the systems of Cronquist ( 1981 ) , Thorne ( 1983 , 1992 ) , and Dahlgren ( 1985 ) . When classification systems were based on morphological characters alone , lilioid species which clearly departed from the " lily " pattern were easily placed into separate families . For example , the Amaryllidaceae contained species whose flowers had six stamens and an inferior ovary . The Iridaceae contained those with three stamens and an inferior ovary . The remaining taxa were put together in a very broadly defined Liliaceae , usually refereed to as Liliaceae sensu lato ( s.l. ) . The Cronquist system 's definition , for example , is the broadest of all . Rolf Dahlgren and colleagues were responsible for one of the most radical reorganisation of families , and in their 1985 monocot monograph defined the two orders ( Asparagales and Liliales ) which contain the bulk of monocot geophytes , as constituting the lilioid monocots . 
 The development of DNA sequencing and the use of genetic data in determining relationships between species of monocots confirmed what many taxonomists had long suspected : Liliaceae s.l. was highly polyphyletic . The family was demonstrated to include a significant number of unrelated groups , which belonged to quite separate families and even orders . For instance some genera such as Hyacinthus , previously placed in Liliaceae s.l. , were reclassified in families within Asparagales ( in this case <unk> ) . In 1995 Chase et al. reviewed the understanding of the lilioids and equated them to <unk> 's Liliiflorae , which they designated as superorder Lilianae . They pointed out that the understanding of the phylogenetics of this group was critical for the establishment of a monocot classification . They also noted that while many authors treated this group as monophyletic ( having a common ancestor ) , a closer reading of their texts revealed evidence of paraphyly ( excluding some descendants of a common ancestor ) . For instance , Dahlgren had based monophyly on a single synapomorphy , that of a petaloid perianth , yet in discussing his <unk> admitted it was undoubtedly paraphyletic . Dahlgren treated the monocots as split between ten superorders and placed five orders ( Dioscoreales , Asparagales , Liliales , Melanthiales , <unk> and <unk> ) in his Liliiflorae . 
 = = = Phylogenetic era = = = 
 In the 1995 study by Chase et al. referred to above , which was the largest yet to use purely molecular data , the results demonstrated paraphyly of the lilioids . However , because their data contradicted purely morphological phylogenies they were reluctant to draw definite conclusions as to the monophyly of this group . They identified four major clades of monocots . They named these <unk> , <unk> , stemonoids and dioscoreoids , in addition to Acorus , and a core group of Asparagales , Liliales and commelinoids . They based the names of these groups on the closest corresponding superorders and orders of Dahlgren , with the exception of stemonoids ( based on Stemonaceae for which there was no obvious equivalent ) . 
 There was no clear clade corresponding to Dahlgren 's Liliiflorae , whose families were distributed amongst the <unk> and dioscoreoids . Of Dahlgren 's Liliiflorae , the Dioscoreales largely grouped into dioscoreoids , with the exception of Stemonaceae . The Asparagales formed two major groupings , which they labelled " higher " and " lower <unk> " , and included both the Iridaceae and Orchidaceae from Dahlgren 's Liliales . On the other hand , a number of families from three other orders ( Asparagales , Dioscoreales , Melanthiales ) segregated together with the remaining Liliales families . Genera from Dahlgren 's Melanthiales were found in both dioscoreoids and the redefined Liliales . Finally Dahlgren 's <unk> were found to belong with the dioscoreoids . Some Asparagales taxa were also found amongst the commelinoids . The stemonoids were formed from Stemonaceae and other families from a variety of orders , including Pandanaceae ( which alone formed Dahlgren 's <unk> ) . 
 In an attempt to resolve the apparent differences between morphological and molecularly defined trees , a combined analysis was undertaken which confirmed superorder Liliiflorae as monophyletic , provided that a few modifications were undertaken . These included the removal of two tribes of <unk> ( Melanthiales ) and the inclusion of three additional families ( <unk> , Pandanaceae and <unk> ) from other superorders . This newly and more narrowly redefined Lilianae / Liliiflorae contained three orders , <unk> , Liliales and Dioscoreales ( which now included the stemonoids ) . This analysis also allowed for the establishment of a single synapomorphy , although this time by the presence of an inferior ovary . Significantly , the authors noted that it was no wonder the authors of angiosperm classifications had been exasperated by the Lilianae . 
 = = = Angiosperm Phylogeny Group = = = 
 These findings , presented at the first Monocot Conference in 1993 , with the addition of several studies that had become available in the interim , formed the basis of the 1998 consensus Angiosperm Phylogeny Group ( APG ) ordinal scheme . Among other things , the Alismatales were expanded and new orders such as Acorales ( a placement for Acorus ) and Pandanales ( which now represented the stemonoids as well as new families ) added . While not formally assigning any <unk> ranks , the classification did recognize an informal grouping of monocot orders as the commelinoids . Otherwise the APG recognized only six monocot orders ( Acorales , Alismatales , Asparagales , Dioscoreales , Liliales and Pandanales ) . The last four were however grouped together in the resulting cladogram and most closely represent the concept of lilioids , although this left some unplaced monocot families , including <unk> and Petrosaviaceae . 
 Simultaneous with the release of the 1998 APG classification were two events : the publication of Kubitzki 's major monograph on the monocots and the Second Monocot Conference . Kubitzki defined superorder Lilianae as all monocots except superorders <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> , that is the four orders Asparagales , Liliales , Dioscoreales and Pandanales . The Monocot Conference devoted an entire section to Systematics of the Lilioids and included an update of their previous research by Chase and colleagues . On this occasion the latter felt that there was now enough data to put forward a definitive classification , defining the Lilioids as comprising the four orders placed in Lilianae by Kubitzki . Rudall and colleagues ( 2002 ) followed Chase ( 2000 ) , in using the term " lilioid monocots " and again noting unresolved polytomy between these four orders and the remaining monocot clades ( commelinids and Petrosaviaceae ) , although at that time the Petrosaviaceae were still unplaced . 
 There was now enough new data to justify revising the APG system , and a new classification was issued in 2003 . Although this resulted in changes within the orders , it did not affect the relationship between them . Lilioid monocots were discussed but not formally recognized ( commelinids , renamed from commelinoids , being the only <unk> grouping in the monocots to be named ) and Petrosaviaceae remained unplaced . The second version of the APG coincided with the third Monocot Conference ( 2003 ) , the findings from which , using additional molecular markers , helped to resolve some of the remaining questions regarding relationships within this assemblage . Petrosaviaceae was shown to be included in what Chase refers to as " <unk> " and placed in order Petrosaviales , while Dioscoreales and Pandanales were demonstrated to be sister clades . Rapid advances in understanding monocot relationships necessitated the release of another revision of the APG classification ( 2009 ) , which incorporated these advances . Further definition of the relationships between lineages using multiple markers is continuing . 
 Textbooks and other sources produced in the last century are inevitably based on older classifications . Publications using versions of the APG system are now appearing and the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families from the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew now uses the APG III system , as does the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website and hence the classification of the lilioid monocots shown in the cladogram below . The Kew botanists treat the monocots as falling into three major groupings : alismatid monocots ( Acorales , Alismatales ) , lilioid monocots ( the five other non @-@ commelinid monocots ) and commelinid monocots . They also organize their monocot research into two teams I : <unk> and Lilioids and II : <unk> . A similar approach is taken by Judd in his Plant systematics . 
 = = Phylogeny and evolution = = 
 The cladogram shown below displays the orders of Lilianae sensu Chase & Reveal ( monocots ) based on molecular phylogenetic evidence . Lilioid monocot orders are bracketed , namely Petrosaviales , Dioscoreales , Pandanales , Liliales and Asparagales . These constitute a paraphyletic assemblage , that is groups with a common ancestor that do not include all direct descendants ( in this case commelinids which are a sister group to Asparagales ) ; to form a clade , all the groups joined by thick lines would need to be included . While Acorales and Alismatales have been collectively referred to as " alismatid monocots " , the remaining clades ( lilioid and commelinid monocots ) have been referred to as the " core monocots " . The relationship between the orders ( with the exception of the two sister orders ) is pectinate , that is diverging in succession from the line that leads to the commelinids . Numbers indicate crown group ( most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest ) divergence times in mya ( million years ago ) . 
 While this is the most commonly understood relationship , Davis et al . ( 2013 ) using a combination of plastid genomes have suggested that if Asparagales is treated sensu stricto by excluding its largest and most atypical family , Orchidaceae then <unk> sensu APG may not be monophyletic and that Orchidaceae and Liliales may be sister groups , and in turn are the sister of Asparagales . However , their data produced conflicting models . Zeng et al . ( 2014 ) using nuclear genes also found evidence for a sister relationship between Asparagales and Liliales . Although divergence time estimates within the lilioids have varied considerably , they were also able to obtain molecular clock estimates for the origin of the lilioids at approximately 125 mya ( Cretaceous period ) . On the other hand , a large data set using a combined analysis of nuclear , mitochondrial and plastid genes together with nuclear <unk> C was in agreement with the earlier APG relationships .

 Nunney Castle is a medieval castle at Nunney in the English county of Somerset . Built in the late 14th century by Sir John Delamare on the profits of his involvement in the Hundred Years War , the moated castle 's architectural style , possibly influenced by the design of French castles , has provoked considerable academic debate . Remodelled during the late 16th century , Nunney Castle was damaged during the English Civil War and is now ruined . English Heritage maintain the site as a tourist attraction . The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner has described Nunney as " aesthetically the most impressive castle in Somerset . " 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 14th century = = = 
 Nunney Castle was built near the village of Nunney in Somerset by Sir John Delamare . Delamare had been a soldier during the Hundred Years War with France , where he had made his fortune . He obtained a licence to crenellate from Edward III to build a castle on the site of his existing , unfortified manor house in 1373 and set about developing a new , substantial fortification . 
 The resulting castle centred on a stone tower @-@ keep , measuring 60 feet by 24 feet ( 18 m by 7 m ) internally and 54 feet ( 16 m ) tall , with four round corner @-@ towers . The tower @-@ keep had eight @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) thick walls made from Lias Oolite ashlar stone and was designed around three floors . The corner towers had conical roofs and prominent machicolations . The ground floor of the tower @-@ house included the kitchen and other service areas . The functions of the first and second floors are uncertain ; one theory is that the first floor was another service area , with the hall on the second floor ; another approach argues that the first floor formed the hall , and the second floor living accommodation ; a minority view proposes that the first floor was an armoury . The third floor was used as living accommodation for the owning family . The original design had a number of windows and fireplaces on the upper floors , but the hall would have been relatively dark and the stairs were inconveniently narrow . 
 The tower @-@ keep had a modest entrance , which was reached by a draw @-@ bridge that lay across the surrounding moat , which initially reached right up to the base of the castle . A simple , 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 6 m ) high bailey wall , with minimal defensive value , surrounded the moat , which was in contrast wide , 10 @-@ foot ( 3 m ) deep , and would have been difficult for an attacker to drain . On the east side of the castle Nunney Brook was used as a line of defence rather than a bailey wall . 
 Historians , such as Adrian Pettifer and Stuart <unk> , previously believed that the design of Nunney was heavily influenced by the French castle designs that Delamare would have seen on his military campaigns . Nunney closely resembles the Bastille in Paris , for example , and the machicolations are typical of those found in French castles . Nunney was considered a conservative , even slightly backward design and probably built to protect against French invasion . Historians such as Robert Liddiard and Matthew Johnson are now less certain . Nunney is regarded as a bold , striking design , similar in many ways to those at Herstmonceux or Saltwood Castle . Whilst Nunney does resemble many French castles , there is no direct evidence that it was built in imitation of these designs , and indeed there are other English castles , such as Mulgrave and Dudley , that have a similar structure to Nunney 's . Nunney Castle may be better understood instead as characteristic of a wider range of tower @-@ keeps built in England during the period , designed , as Nigel Pounds puts it , " to allow very rich men to live in luxury and splendour . "

 Nunney Castle was inherited by John 's son , Philip Delamere , and grandson , Elias , before passing by marriage into the Poulet family following Elias ' probable death during Henry V 's campaigns in France . Sir John Poulet and his son John , and grandson , also called John , held the castle during most of the 15th century , but their primary residence was Basing Castle in Hampshire rather than Nunney . William Paulet , the Marquess of Winchester , was the final member of the family to own the castle ; after his death in 1572 it passed rapidly through several owners and in 1577 was sold by Swithun Thorpe to John Parker , who only kept it for a year before selling it to Richard Prater , at a cost of £ 2 @,@ 000 . The castle was redeveloped in the second half of the 16th century , probably by the <unk> : the windows were enlarged to let in more light ; a grand staircase was built in one of the towers ; a Catholic altar was installed , and a revetment , or terrace , was built around the inside of the moat , leaving it 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) wide .

 Nunney Castle continued to be owned by the Roman Catholic Prater family into the 17th century . In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the rival factions of Parliament and the king ; like many Catholics , Colonel Richard Prater supported Charles I. As the war progressed the Royalist situation deteriorated , however , and the south @-@ west became one of the few remaining Royalist strongholds ; Nunney Castle was garrisoned in anticipation of Parliamentary attack and took in a number of refugees , including many Catholics . In September 1645 a Parliamentary army under the command of Lord Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell advanced into Somerset , taking Sherborne , Cary and Shepton Mallet before turning to Nunney . Two regiments of soldiers with cannons surrounded the castle on 18 September ; when Richard Prater refused to surrender , the cannons opened fire on the north side of the castle , breaching the castle wall . Richard continued to resist , hoisting a flag with a Catholic crucifix on it above the castle to taunt the besiegers , but two days later the garrison surrendered . 
 Due to the damage caused by the cannon , the castle escaped the slighting , or deliberate damaging , that occurred to many other castles at the end of the civil war . Nonetheless , Richard Prater was forbidden to return to the castle , despite his promises to support Parliament , and his son , George Prater , only recovered Nunney from its interim owners after Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 . The castle declined and was sold by the <unk> to William Whitchurch around 1700 . During the 18th century the building was still in a reasonable condition and in 1789 an order was received make it ready to receive French prisoners , although it is unlikely they ever arrived .

 By the 20th century , Nunney Castle was increasingly ruined and covered in thick ivy . As a result , on 25 December 1910 a portion of the damaged north wall entirely collapsed — most of the fallen stone was stolen by local people . In 1926 , with the fabric of the castle under threat , the owner , Robert Bailey @-@ Neale , transferred the property to the Commissioner of Works , who began a programme of restoration work . The castle is now run by English Heritage as a tourist attraction and is a scheduled monument . The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner has described the castle as " aesthetically the most impressive castle in Somerset . "

 Air Marshal John William " Jake " Newham , AC ( born 30 November 1930 ) is a retired senior commander of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . He served as Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) from 1985 until 1987 . Joining the RAAF in 1951 , he flew Gloster Meteor jets with No. 77 Squadron in the Korean War in 1953 , and subsequently de Havilland Vampires with No. 78 Wing on garrison duty in Malta . From 1958 to 1960 , he served with No. 3 Squadron , operating CAC Sabres during the Malayan Emergency . He took charge of No. 3 Squadron in 1967 , when it re @-@ equipped with the Dassault Mirage III supersonic fighter . His commands in the early 1970s included the Aircraft Research and Development Unit , RAAF Base Laverton , and No. 82 Wing , the last @-@ mentioned during its first years operating the long @-@ delayed General Dynamics F @-@ 111C swing @-@ wing bomber . He was appointed Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in March 1984 , and CAS in May the following year . His tenure as CAS coincided with the release of the Dibb Report on Australia 's defence capabilities , and the controversial transfer of the RAAF 's battlefield helicopters to the Australian Army . Newham retired from the Air Force in July 1987 and became a company director . 
 = = Early career = = 
 John William Newham , known as " Jake " , was born in Cowra , New South Wales , and educated at Cowra High School . After matriculating , he worked as a clerk in the Commonwealth Bank , and joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) in February 1951 . He underwent flying training at RAAF Base Point Cook , Victoria , and graduated as a sergeant pilot in July 1952 . Following fighter training , he saw operational service in the Korean War , flying Gloster Meteor jets with No. 77 Squadron from February to September 1953 . He later recalled that his first sortie was as wingman to a Royal Air Force flight lieutenant : " We flew up past P 'yongyang and he showed me enemy gun locations by arranging for them to shoot at us " . 
 Having been commissioned as a pilot officer midway through his Korean service , Newham 's next posting was with No. 78 ( Fighter ) Wing on Malta , where he flew de Havilland Vampires until 1955 . The wing had been on garrison duty in Malta since July 1952 , and Newham was one of five Korean War veterans who replaced pilots posted back to Australia . He married Jo Cranston in 1956 ; the couple had two daughters and a son . By November 1957 , Newham had been promoted to flight lieutenant and was undergoing conversion training on the CAC Sabre . From 1958 to 1960 he served in Malaya with No. 3 Squadron , whose Sabres conducted operations against communist guerrillas in the final years of the Malayan Emergency . 
 = = Rise to senior command = = 
 Newham attended RAAF Staff College , Canberra , from January to December 1964 . He then served as Chief Flying Instructor at No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown , New South Wales , taking temporary command of the unit as a squadron leader from July 1965 to April 1966 . That August , he commenced conversion training on the Dassault Mirage III supersonic jet fighter . Promoted to wing commander , from July 1967 to October 1968 he led No. 3 Squadron at Williamtown as it re @-@ equipped with the Mirage . In 1971 , Newham was appointed commanding officer of the Aircraft Research and Development Unit . The following year he became Officer Commanding RAAF Base Laverton , Victoria . 
 By now a group captain , Newham was appointed Officer Commanding No. 82 Wing at RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , in 1973 . He formed the RAAF Washington Flying Unit at McClellan Air Force Base , California , on 31 March to ferry the first twelve ( out of a total order of twenty @-@ four ) General Dynamics F @-@ 111C swing @-@ wing bombers to Australia . On 1 June , Newham led the first three F @-@ 111s in to land at Amberley , a gala occasion attended by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence , Lance Barnard , the Chief of the Air Staff , Air Marshal Charles Read , the Air Officer Commanding Operational Command , Air Vice Marshal Brian Eaton , and a large media contingent . Newham later recalled that " our air force cred went up in the area and in the world with that aeroplane " . Read ordered Newham to operate the F @-@ 111 with great caution initially , well within limits , lest the long @-@ delayed and controversial aircraft suffer greater damage to its reputation through early attrition . Despite Newham 's protests over the plane 's capabilities , the restrictions remained in place until 1975 . That year he was appointed Staff Officer Operations at Headquarters Operational Command ( OPCOM ) . 
 = = Senior command and later life = = 
 Newham was promoted air commodore in 1976 and became Senior Air Staff Officer at OPCOM , serving through the following year . In 1978 he attended the Royal College of Defence Studies , London , and was made Director General of Operational Requirements in 1979 . In this capacity he visited Israel to investigate air @-@ to @-@ air refuelling operations , coming away favourably impressed : " the Israelis had more match practice than anybody around at the time . The experience gave me confidence in operational judgments . " He was promoted air vice marshal and appointed Chief of Air Force Operations in March 1980 , effective from April , and served on the Chief of the Air Staff Advisory Committee . In 1982 he was posted to the United States as the Head of Australian Defence Staff in Washington , D.C. Returning to Australia , Newham became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in March 1984 . He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia on 11 June for services to the RAAF . 
 Promoted to air marshal , Newham became Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) on 21 May 1985 , succeeding Air Marshal David Evans . Newham initially endorsed the Federal government 's 1986 Review of Australia 's Defence Capabilities , otherwise known as the Dibb Report , but shortly afterwards publicly criticised its " understanding of the application of air power " and " debatable judgments " , especially its lukewarm attitude to the employment of the F @-@ 111s for strategic strike . At a conference the same year , he reiterated the RAAF 's position that " defensive action may prevent defeat , but wars can be won only by offensive action " . On 9 June , he was raised to Companion of the Order of Australia for service to the RAAF , " particularly as Chief of the Air Staff " . Newham 's term as CAS was also marked by the Federal government 's decision to transfer the RAAF 's battlefield helicopters to the Australian Army , against the recommendation of an independent committee . According to Air Force historians Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs , " Newham protected the best interests of the Australian Defence Force by getting on with the business of effecting the transfer , notwithstanding the deep disappointment within his own service . In February 1987 , OPCOM ( subsequently Air Command ) was restructured into Force Element Groups ( FEGs ) , large functional organisations that supplanted the earlier concept of all @-@ powerful air base commands , to which every unit on a base reported . Initially established on a one @-@ year trial basis , the FEGs have remained in place . 
 Newham completed his tenure as CAS on 3 July 1987 and was succeeded by Air Marshal Ray Funnell . Retiring from the Air Force , he became Director of <unk> Industries . On 23 July 1998 , he was among those present when the Korean Ambassador to Australia awarded his government 's Presidential Unit Citation to No. 77 Squadron . Newham was one of ten surviving veterans of the squadron belatedly presented with the US Air Medal in Canberra on 27 June 2011 , for meritorious service in the Korean War .

 Parasaurolophus ( / <unk> / PARR @-@ ə @-@ saw @-@ <unk> @-@ ə @-@ <unk> or / <unk> / PARR @-@ <unk> SAWR @-@ ə @-@ LOH @-@ <unk> ; meaning " near crested lizard " in reference to Saurolophus ) is a genus of ornithopod dinosaur that lived in what is now North America during the Late Cretaceous Period , about 76 @.@ 5 – 74 @.@ 5 million years ago . It was a herbivore that walked both as a biped and a quadruped . Three species are recognized : P. walkeri ( the type species ) , P. tubicen , and the short @-@ crested P. cyrtocristatus . Remains are known from Alberta ( Canada ) , and New Mexico and Utah ( USA ) . The genus was first described in 1922 by William Parks from a skull and partial skeleton found in Alberta . 
 Parasaurolophus was a hadrosaurid , part of a diverse family of Cretaceous dinosaurs known for their range of bizarre head adornments . This genus is known for its large , elaborate cranial crest , which at its largest forms a long curved tube projecting upwards and back from the skull . Charonosaurus from China , which may have been its closest relative , had a similar skull and potentially a similar crest . Visual recognition of both species and sex , acoustic resonance , and thermoregulation have been proposed as functional explanations for the crest . It is one of the rarer hadrosaurids , known from only a handful of good specimens . 
 = = Description = = 
 Like most dinosaurs , the skeleton of Parasaurolophus is incompletely known . The length of the type specimen of P. walkeri is estimated at 9 @.@ 5 m ( 31 ft ) , and its weight is estimated at 2 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 2 @.@ 8 short tons ) . Its skull is about 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 ft 3 in ) long , including the crest , whereas the type skull of P. tubicen is over 2 m ( 6 ft 7 in ) long , indicating a larger animal . Its single known forelimb was relatively short for a hadrosaurid , with a short but wide shoulder blade . The thighbone measures 103 cm ( 41 in ) long in P. walkeri and is robust for its length when compared to other hadrosaurids . The upper arm and pelvic bones were also heavily built . 
 Like other hadrosaurids , it was able to walk on either two legs or four . It probably preferred to forage for food on four legs , but ran on two . The neural spines of the vertebrae were tall , as was common in lambeosaurines ; tallest over the hips , they increased the height of the back . Skin impressions are known for P. walkeri , showing uniform tubercle @-@ like scales but no larger structures . 
 = = = Skull = = = 
 The most noticeable feature was the cranial crest , which protruded from the rear of the head and was made up of the premaxilla and nasal bones . William Parks , who named the genus , hypothesized that a ligament ran from the crest to the notch to support the head , and cited the presence of possibly pathological notch as evidence . Although this idea seems unlikely , Parasaurolophus is sometimes restored with a skin flap from the crest to the neck . The crest was hollow , with distinct tubes leading from each nostril to the end of the crest before reversing direction and heading back down the crest and into the skull . The tubes were simplest in P. walkeri , and more complex in P. tubicen , where some tubes were blind and others met and separated . While P. walkeri and P. tubicen had long crests with only slight curvature , P. cyrtocristatus had a short crest with a more circular profile . 
 = = Classification = = 
 As its name implies , Parasaurolophus was initially thought to be closely related to Saurolophus because of its superficially similar crest . However , it was soon reassessed as a member of the lambeosaurine subfamily of hadrosaurids — Saurolophus is an hadrosaurine . It is usually interpreted as a separate offshoot of the lambeosaurines , distinct from the helmet @-@ crested Corythosaurus , Hypacrosaurus , and Lambeosaurus . Its closest known relative appears to be Charonosaurus , a lambeosaurine with a similar skull ( but no complete crest yet ) from the Amur region of northeastern China , and the two may form a clade <unk> . P. cyrtocristatus , with its short , rounder crest , may be the most basal of the three known Parasaurolophus species , or it may represent subadult or female specimens of P. tubicen . 
 The following cladogram is after the 2007 redescription of Lambeosaurus magnicristatus ( Evans and Reisz , 2007 ) : 
 = = Discovery and naming = = 
 Meaning " near crested lizard " , the name Parasaurolophus is derived from the Greek para / <unk> " beside " or " near " , saurus / σαυρος " lizard " and lophos / <unk> " crest " . It is based on ROM 768 , a skull and partial skeleton missing most of the tail and the hind legs below the knees , which was found by a field party from the University of Toronto in 1920 near Sand Creek along the Red Deer River in Alberta , Canada . These rocks are now known as the Campanian @-@ age Upper Cretaceous Dinosaur Park Formation . William Parks named the specimen P. walkeri in honor of Sir Byron Edmund Walker , Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Royal Ontario Museum . Parasaurolophus remains are rare in Alberta , with only one other partial skull from ( probably ) the Dinosaur Park Formation , and three Dinosaur Park specimens lacking skulls , possibly belonging to the genus . In some faunal lists , there is a mention of possible P. walkeri material in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana , a rock unit of late Maastrichtian age . This occurrence is not noted by Sullivan and Williamson in their 1999 review of the genus , and has not been further elaborated upon elsewhere . It is possible that the fossil specimen could be an undescribed lambeosaurine . 
 In 1921 , Charles H. Sternberg recovered a partial skull ( <unk> ) from what is now known as the slightly younger Kirtland Formation in San Juan County , New Mexico . This specimen was sent to Uppsala , Sweden , where Carl Wiman described it as a second species , P. tubicen , in 1931 . The specific epithet is derived from the Latin <unk> " trumpeter " . A second , nearly complete P. tubicen skull ( <unk> P @-@ <unk> ) was found in New Mexico in 1995 . Using computed tomography of this skull , Robert Sullivan and Thomas Williamson gave the genus a monographic treatment in 1999 , covering aspects of its anatomy and taxonomy , and the functions of its crest . Williamson later published an independent review of the remains , disagreeing with the taxonomic conclusions . 
 John Ostrom described another good specimen ( FMNH <unk> ) from New Mexico as P. cyrtocristatus in 1961 . It includes a partial skull with a short , rounded crest , and much of the postcranial skeleton except for the feet , neck , and parts of the tail . Its specific name is derived from the Latin curtus " shortened " and cristatus " crested " . The specimen was found in either the top of the Fruitland Formation or , more likely , the base of the overlying Kirtland Formation . The range of this species was expanded in 1979 , when David B. Weishampel and James A. Jensen described a partial skull with a similar crest ( BYU <unk> ) from the Campanian @-@ age Kaiparowits Formation of Garfield County , Utah . Since then , another skull has been found in Utah with the short / round P. cyrtocristatus crest morphology . 
 = = = Species = = = 
 Parasaurolophus is known from three certain species , P. walkeri , P. tubicen , and P. cyrtocristatus . All of them can be distinguished from each other , and have many differences . The first named species , therefore the type , is P. walkeri . One certain specimen , from the Dinosaur Park Formation is referred to it , but many more are almost certainly referable . Like stated above , it is different from the other two species , with it having a simpler internal structure than P. tubicen , a straighter crest and different internal structuring than P. cyrtocristatus . 
 The next named species is P. tubicen , which is the largest of the Parasaurolophus species . It lived in New Mexico , where three specimens are known , and can be differentiated from its other species . It possesses a long and straight crest , with a very complex interior compared to the other species . All known specimens of P. tubicen come from the De @-@ Na @-@ Zin Member of the Kirtland Formation . 
 In 1961 , the third species , P. cyrtocristatus was named by John Ostrom . Its three known specimens , have been found in the Fruitland and Kaiparowits formations from Utah and New Mexico . The second specimen , the first known from the Kaiparowits Formation , was originally unassigned to a specific taxon . Of the Parasaurolophus species , P. cyrtocristatus it is the smallest , and has the most curved crest . Because of its possession of the two above features , it has often been speculated that it was a female of P. walkeri or P. tubicen , which were males , although P. tubicen lived approximately a million years later . As noted by Thomas Williamson , the type material of P. cyrtocristatus is about 72 % the size of P. tubicen , close to the size at which other lambeosaurines are interpreted to begin showing definitive sexual dimorphism in their crests ( ~ 70 % of adult size ) . Even though many scientists have supported the possible fact of P. cyrtocristatus being a female , many other studies have found that it is not , because of the differences in age , distribution , and the large differences in the crest and its internal structure . 
 A study published in PLoS ONE in 2014 found that one more species could be referred to Parasaurolophus . This study , led by Xing , found Charonosaurus <unk> was actually nested deeply inside Parasaurolophus , which created the new species P. <unk> . If this species is indeed inside Parasaurolophus , then the genus lasted until the K @-@ Pg extinction , and is known from two continents . 
 = = Paleobiology = = 
 = = = Diet and feeding = = = 
 As a hadrosaurid , Parasaurolophus was a large bipedal / quadrupedal herbivore , eating plants with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing . Its teeth were continually being replaced ; they were packed into dental batteries containing hundreds of teeth , only a relative handful of which were in use at any time . It used its beak to crop plant material , which was held in the jaws by a cheek @-@ like organ . Vegetation could have been taken from the ground up to a height of around 4 m ( 13 ft ) . As noted by Bob Bakker , lambeosaurines have narrower beaks than hadrosaurines , implying that Parasaurolophus and its relatives could feed more selectively than their broad @-@ beaked , crestless counterparts . 
 = = = Growth = = = 
 Parasaurolophus is known from many adult specimens , and a juvenile described in 2013 . The juvenile was discovered in the Kaiparowits Formation in 2009 . Excavated by the joint expedition by The Webb Schools and Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology ( RAM ) , the juvenile has been identified as around only one year old when it died . Referred to Parasaurolophus sp . , the juvenile , under specimen number RAM 14000 , is the most complete , as well as youngest Parasaurolophus ever found , and measures 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) . This individual fits neatly into the currently known Parasaurolophus growth stages , and lived approximately 75 million years ago . Even though no complete skull of the intermediate age between RAM 14000 and adult Parasaurolophus has been found yet , a partial braincase of about the right size is known . At 25 % of the total adult size , the juvenile show that crest growth of Parasaurolophus began sooner than in related genera , such as Corythosaurus . It has been suggested that Parasaurolophus adults bore such large crests , especially when compared to the related Corythosaurus , because of this difference in age between when their crests started developing . Its age also means that Parasaurolophus had an very fast growth , which took place in about a year . The crest of the juvenile is not long and tubular like the adults , but low and hemispherical . 
 The skull of RAM 14000 is almost complete , with the left side only lacking a piece of the maxilla . However , the skull was split down the middle by erosion , possibly when it was resting on the bottom of a river bed . The two sides are displaced slightly , with some bones of the right being moved off the main block , also by erosion . After reconstruction , the skull viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found , being roughly a trapezoid in shape . 
 A partial cranial endocast for RAM 14000 was reconstructed from CT scan data , the first ever for a Parasaurolophus of any ontogenetic stage . The endocast was reconstructed in two sections , one on the portion of the braincase articulated with the left half of the skull and the remainder on the disarticulated portion of the braincase . Their relative position was then approximated based on cranial landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids . Because of weathering , many of the smaller neural canals and foramina could not be identified for certain . 
 = = = Cranial crest = = = 
 Many hypotheses have been advanced as to what functions the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus performed , but most have been discredited . It is now believed that it may have had several functions : visual display for identifying species and sex , sound amplification for communication , and thermoregulation . It is not clear which was most significant at what times in the evolution of the crest and its internal nasal passages . 
 = = = = Differences in crests = = = = 
 As for other lambeosaurines , it is believed that the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus changed with age and was a sexually dimorphic characteristic in adults . James Hopson , one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions , suggested that P. cyrtocristatus , with its small crest , was the female form of P. tubicen . Thomas Williamson suggested it was the juvenile form . Neither hypothesis became widely accepted . As only six good skulls , one juvenile braincase , and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known , additional material will help clear up these potential relationships . Williamson noted that in any case , juvenile Parasaurolophus probably had small , rounded crests like P. cyrtocristatus , that probably grew faster as individuals approached sexual maturity . Recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to Lambeosaurus , now assigned to Parasaurolophus , provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles . This specimen preserves a small upward flaring of the frontal bones that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens ; in adults , the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the crest . This specimen also indicates that the growth of the crest in Parasaurolophus and the facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from the Corythosaurus @-@ Hypacrosaurus @-@ Lambeosaurus model , in part because the crest of Parasaurolophus lacks the thin bony ' coxcomb ' that makes up the upper portion of the crest of the other three lambeosaurines . 
 = = = = Rejected function hypotheses = = = = 
 Many early suggestions focused on adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle , following the hypothesis that hadrosaurids were amphibious , a common line of thought until the 1960s . Thus , Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed it served as a snorkel , Martin <unk> that it was an attachment for a mobile proboscis used as a breathing tube or for food gathering , Charles M. Sternberg that it served as an <unk> to keep water out of the lungs , and Ned Colbert that it served as an air reservoir for prolonged stays underwater . 
 Other proposals were more physical in nature . As mentioned above , William Parks suggested that it was joined to the vertebrae with ligaments or muscles , and helped with moving and supporting the head . <unk> Abel proposed it was used as a weapon in combat among members of the same species , and Andrew Milner suggested that it could be used as a foliage deflector , like the helmet crest ( called a ' <unk> ' ) of the cassowary . Still other proposals made housing specialized organs the major function . Halszka Osmólska suggested that it housed salt glands , and John Ostrom suggested that it housed expanded areas for olfactory tissue and much improved sense of smell of the lambeosaurines , which had no obvious defensive capabilities . One unusual suggestion , made by creationist Duane Gish , is that the crest housed chemical glands that allowed it to throw jets of chemical " fire " at enemies , similar to the modern @-@ day bombardier beetle . 
 Most of these hypotheses have been discredited or rejected . For example , there is no hole at the end of the crest for a snorkeling function . There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one . As a proposed airlock , it would not have kept out water . The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus . Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments . Also , none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape , why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function , how crestless or solid @-@ crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities , or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests . These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal , such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses , and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest . Additionally , work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest , so the expansion of the crest had little to do with the sense of smell . 
 = = = = Temperature regulation hypothesis = = = = 
 The large surface area and vascularization of the crest also suggests a thermoregulatory function . The first to propose the cranial crests of lambeosaurines related to temperature regulation was Wheeler ( 1978 ) . He proposed that there was a nerve connection between the crest and the brain , so that the latter could be cooled by the former . The next people to publish a related idea were <unk> and Osmólska , who realized that like modern lizards , dinosaurs could have possessed salt glands , and cooled off by <unk> @-@ regulation . In 2006 Evans published an argument about the functions of lambeosaurine crests , and supported why this could be a causing factor for the evolution of the crest . 
 = = = = Behavioural hypotheses = = = = 
 Parasaurolophus is often hypothesized to have used its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other members of a group or its species . This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described P. tubicen . He noted that the crests internal structures are similar to those of a swan , and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise . However , the nasal tubes of Hypacrosaurus , Corythosaurus , and Lambeosaurus are much more variable and complicated than the airway of Parasaurolophus . A large amount of material and data supports the hypothesis that the large , tubular crest of Parasaurolophus was a resonating chamber . Weishampel in 1981 suggested that Parasaurolophus made noises ranging between the frequencies 55 and 720 Hz , although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size , shape , and nasal passage length , most obvious in P. cyrtocristatus ( interpreted as a possible female ) . Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had strong hearing . There is at least one example , in the related Corythosaurus , of a slender stapes ( reptilian ear bone ) in place , which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear . Furthermore , the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian 's , indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well @-@ developed . Based on similarity of hadrosaurid inner ears to those of crocodiles , he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies , such as their offspring might produce . According to Weishampel , this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating . 
 Computer modeling of a well @-@ preserved specimen of P. tubicen , with more complex air passages than those of P. walkeri , has allowed the reconstruction of the possible sound its crest produced . The main path resonates at around 30 Hz , but the complicated sinus anatomy causes peaks and valleys in the sound . The other main behavioural theory is that the crest was used for intra @-@ species recognition . This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition , as a warning signal , and for other , non @-@ sexual uses . These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids . Instead , social and physiological functions have become more supported as function ( s ) of the crest , focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication . As a large object , the crest has clear value as a visual signal , and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries . The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits , evidence that sight was important to these animals . If , as is commonly illustrated , a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back , the proposed visual display would have been even showier . As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls , the crest of Parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification ( such as separating it from Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus ) and sexual identification by shape and size .
