 Black Swan is a 2010 American psychological thriller film directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Natalie Portman , Vincent Cassel , Mila Kunis and Winona Ryder . The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake ballet by a prestigious New York City company . The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan , for which the committed dancer Nina ( Portman ) is a perfect fit , as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan , which are qualities better embodied by the new arrival Lily ( Kunis ) . Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part , causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare . 
 Usually described as a psychological thriller , Black Swan can be also interpreted as a metaphor for achieving artistic perfection , with all the psychological and physical challenges one might encounter , i.e. " the film can be perceived as a poetic metaphor for the birth of an artist , that is , as a visual representation of Nina ’ s psychic odyssey toward achieving artistic perfection and of the price to be paid for it . " 
 Aronofsky conceived the premise by connecting his viewings of a production of Swan Lake with an unrealized screenplay about understudies and the notion of being haunted by a double , similar to the folklore surrounding doppelgängers . Aronofsky cites Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's " The Double " as another inspiration for the film . The director also considered Black Swan a companion piece to his 2008 film The Wrestler , with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art . He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000 , and after a brief attachment to Universal Studios , Black Swan was produced in New York City in 2009 by Fox Searchlight Pictures . Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming , and notable figures from the ballet world helped with film production to shape the ballet presentation . 
 The film premiered as the opening film for the 67th Venice International Film Festival on September 1 , 2010 . It had a limited release in the United States starting December 3 , 2010 and opened nationwide on December 17 . Black Swan received critical praise upon its release , particularly for Portman 's performance and Aronofsky 's direction , and was a surprise box office success , grossing $ 329 million worldwide . The film received five Academy Award nominations and Portman won the Best Actress award for the film , as well as many other Best Actress awards in several guilds and festivals . In addition , Aronofsky was nominated for Best Director and the film was nominated for Best Picture . It is the fifth horror film to be nominated in the Best Picture category , after The Exorcist in 1973 , Jaws in 1975 , The Silence of the Lambs in 1991 , and The Sixth Sense in 1999 .

 Nina Sayers ( Natalie Portman ) , is a professional dancer in a New York ballet company . Nina lives in New York City with her overprotective mother , Erica ( Barbara Hershey ) . The company is preparing to open the season with Swan Lake . The director , Thomas Leroy ( Vincent Cassel ) , is looking for a new principal dancer after forcing Beth Macintyre ( Winona Ryder ) into retirement . Thomas wants the same ballerina to portray the innocent , fragile White Swan as well as her mysterious , sensual twin , the Black Swan . Nina auditions for the part , performing flawlessly as the White Swan , but she is not able to emulate the characteristics of the Black Swan . Upset , Nina approaches Thomas and asks him to reconsider her as the lead role . Thomas forcibly kisses Nina , and she displays a change of character and bites him , convincing him that she has the ferocity to play the Black Swan . Nina begins to witness strange happenings , and her mother finds scratches on her back . 
 An intoxicated Beth angrily confronts Thomas and Nina . Nina is worried that she will befall the same eventual fate as Beth , but stays quiet . Thomas tells Nina she needs to give herself to the sensuality of the Black Swan . He tells her to go home and masturbate , which she does . The next day , Nina finds out that Beth was seriously injured in a car accident , and Thomas tells her it was a suicide attempt . Nina realizes Beth will never dance again , and tearfully unpacks her belongings in Beth 's former dressing room . 
 Thomas tells Nina to watch Lily ( Mila Kunis ) , another dancer in the company , whom he describes as lacking Nina 's flawless technique but possessing an uninhibited quality that Nina has not shown . The relationship between Nina and Lily grows tense . During rehearsal , Thomas kisses Nina passionately , but leaves abruptly and tells her she must seduce him with her dancing . Nina finds unexplained scratches and blood on her body . Nina and her mother have an argument , interrupted by Lily 's unexpected arrival at their apartment . Lily and Nina go for a night out . 
 At a restaurant that evening , Lily offers Nina a capsule of ecstasy to help her relax . Initially , Nina turns it down , but later accepts a drink with ecstasy powder in it . Nina returns home late with Lily , fights with her mother , barricades herself in her room , and has sex with Lily until the latter seemingly smothers her with a pillow . The next morning , Nina wakes up alone and late for the dress rehearsal . When she arrives at the studio , she finds Lily dancing the Black Swan . After she confronts her , Lily admits she spent the night with a man she met at the club , and Nina realizes the encounter didn 't really happen . Nina 's hallucinations become stronger and more graphically sexual and violent . 
 Nina trashes the apartment and slams her bedroom door on her mother 's hands , and has hallucinations of becoming freakishly <unk> . Concerned about Nina 's behavior , her mother tries to prevent her from performing on opening night in an effort to keep her daughter safe . An enraged Nina forces her way out of the apartment . Thomas had assigned understudy Lily to take over , but is impressed at Nina 's confidence , and lets her play the Swan Queen . The first act goes well , until Nina is distracted by a hallucination during a lift , causing her partner to drop her . Distraught , she returns to her dressing room and finds Lily there . Lily announces her plans to play the Black Swan . Nina shoves her into a mirror , shattering it . Lily , seemingly dead , awakens , and her face changes shape , now a copy of Nina 's . The doppelganger starts to strangle Nina , who then grabs a shard of glass and stabs her rival in the stomach , apparently killing her . The doppelganger 's face reverts to that of Lily 's . Nina hides the body and returns to the stage . 
 <unk> feathers , her arms become black wings as she finally loses herself and is transformed into a black swan . At the end of the act , she receives a standing ovation . Offstage , Thomas and the rest of the cast congratulate her on her stunning performance . Nina takes Thomas by surprise and kisses him . Back in her dressing room before the final act , Nina is congratulated by Lily , revealing that their fight was , again , imaginary . The mirror , however , is still shattered . Nina removes a small shard from her own body and realizes she stabbed herself . Dancing the last scene , in which the White Swan throws herself off a cliff , Nina spots her mother weeping in the audience . As Nina falls backward onto a hidden mattress , the theater erupts in thunderous applause . Thomas and the cast gather to congratulate her — only to find that she is bleeding profusely . As the white ceiling lights envelop her , she whispers , " I felt it . Perfect . It was perfect . "

 Darren Aronofsky first became interested in ballet when his sister studied dance at the High School of Performing Arts in New York City . The basic idea for the film started when he hired screenwriters to rework a screenplay called The Understudy , which was about off @-@ Broadway actors and explored the notion of being haunted by a double . Aronofsky said the screenplay had elements of All About Eve , Roman Polanski 's The Tenant , and Fyodor Dostoyevsky 's novella The Double . The director had also seen numerous productions of Swan Lake , and he connected the duality of the White Swan and the Black Swan to the script . When researching for the production of Black Swan , Aronofsky found ballet to be " a very insular world " whose dancers were " not impressed by movies " . Regardless , the director found active and inactive dancers to share their experiences with him . He also stood backstage to see the Bolshoi Ballet perform at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts . 
 Aronofsky called Black Swan a companion piece to his previous film The Wrestler , recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina . He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds as " too much for one movie " . He compared the two films : " Wrestling some consider the lowest art — if they would even call it art — and ballet some people consider the highest art . But what was amazing to me was how similar the performers in both of these worlds are . They both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves . " About the psychological thriller nature of Black Swan , actress Natalie Portman compared the film 's tone to Polanski 's 1968 film Rosemary 's Baby , while Aronofsky said Polanski 's Repulsion ( 1965 ) and The Tenant ( 1976 ) were " big influences " on the final film . Actor Vincent Cassel also compared Black Swan to Polanski 's early works and additionally compared it to David Cronenberg 's early works .

 Aronofsky first discussed with Portman the possibility of a ballet film in 2000 , and he found she was interested in playing a ballet dancer . Portman explained being part of Black Swan , " I 'm trying to find roles that demand more adulthood from me because you can get stuck in a very awful cute cycle as a woman in film , especially being such a small person . " Portman suggested to Aronofsky that her good friend Mila Kunis would be perfect for the role . Kunis contrasted Lily with Nina , " My character is very loose ... She 's not as technically good as Natalie 's character , but she has more passion , naturally . That 's what [ Nina ] lacks . " The female characters are directed in the Swan Lake production by Thomas Leroy , played by Cassel . He compared his character to George Balanchine , who co @-@ founded New York City Ballet and was " a control freak , a true artist using sexuality to direct his dancers " . 
 Portman and Kunis started training six months before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers . Portman worked out for five hours a day , doing ballet , cross @-@ training , and swimming . A few months closer to filming , she began choreography training . Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates , " train [ ing ] seven days a week , five hours , for five , six months total , and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1 @,@ 200 calories a day . " She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds , and reported that Portman " became smaller than I did . " Kunis said , " I did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet . You wear a tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl . But this is very different because you can 't fake it . You can 't just stay in there and like pretend you know what you 're doing . Your whole body has to be structured differently . " Georgina Parkinson , a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre ( ABT ) , coached the actors in ballet . ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria <unk> served as " dance doubles " for Portman and Kunis respectively . Dancer Kimberly <unk> also served as a double for Portman . She stated : " Natalie took class , she studied for several months , from the waist up is her . Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT , did the heavy tricks , she did the <unk> , but they only had her for a limited time , a couple of weeks , so I did the rest of whatever dance shots they needed . " 
 In addition to the soloist performances , members of the Pennsylvania Ballet were cast as the corps de ballet , backdrop for the main actors ' performances . Also appearing in the film are Kristina <unk> , Toby Hemingway , Sebastian Stan , and Janet Montgomery .

 Aronofsky and Portman first discussed a ballet film in 2000 , after the release of Requiem for a Dream , though the script had not yet been written . He told her about a love scene between competing ballet dancers , and Portman recalled , " I thought that was very interesting because this movie is in so many ways an exploration of an artist 's ego and that narcissistic sort of attraction to yourself and also repulsion with yourself . " On the decade 's wait before production , she said , " The fact that I had spent so much time with the idea ... allowed it to marinate a little before we shot . " 
 The screenplay The Understudy was written by Andres Heinz ; Aronofsky first heard about it while editing his second film Requiem for a Dream ( 2000 ) and described it as " All About Eve with a double , set in the off @-@ Broadway world . " After making The Fountain ( 2006 ) , Aronofsky and producer Mike Medavoy had screenwriter John McLaughlin rewrite The Understudy ; Aronofsky said McLaughlin " took my idea of Swan Lake and the ballet and put [ the story ] into the ballet world and changed the title to Black Swan . " When Aronofsky proposed a detailed outline of Black Swan to Universal Pictures , the studio decided to fast @-@ track development of the project in January 2007 . The project " sort of died , again " according to Aronofsky , until after the making of The Wrestler ( 2008 ) , when he had Mark Heyman , director of development of Aronofsky 's production company Protozoa Pictures , write for Black Swan " and made it something that was workable . " By June 2009 , Universal had placed the project in turnaround , generating attention from other studios and specialty divisions , particularly with actress Portman attached to star . Black Swan began development under Protozoa Pictures and Overnight Productions , the latter financing the film . In July 2009 , Kunis was cast . 
 Fox Searchlight Pictures distributed Black Swan and gave the film a production budget of $ 10 – 12 million . Principal photography was achieved using Super 16 mm cameras and began in New York City toward the end of 2009 . Part of filming took place at the Performing Arts Center at State University of New York at Purchase . Aronofsky filmed Black Swan with a muted palette and a grainy style , which he intended to be similar to The Wrestler . Aronofsky said 
 I like Super 16 because the cameras are really light , really moveable . Also , for The Wrestler it was a money @-@ saving thing . The film stocks on 35mm would become so glossy that they 'd get close to what people are doing on video . I wanted to go back to the grainy , vérité feel of The Wrestler . ... Like with wrestling , ballet is shot in wide shot with two shots on the side , and no one really brought the camera — well , wrestling — into the ring or for us , onto the stage and into the practice room . I really wanted the camera to dance , but I was nervous about shooting a psychological thriller / horror film with a hand @-@ held camera . I couldn 't think of another example where they did that . ... steady @-@ cams are very different than hand @-@ <unk> , because hand @-@ held gives you that verite feel . I was concerned if that would effect [ sic ] the suspense , but after a while I said , " screw it , let 's go for it . "

 Amy Westcott is credited as the costume designer and received several award nominations . A publicized controversy arose regarding the question of who had designed 40 ballet costumes for Portman and the dancers . An article in the British newspaper The Independent suggested those costumes had actually been created by Rodarte 's Kate and Laura <unk> . Westcott challenged that view and stated that in all only 7 costumes , among them the black and white swan , had been created in a collaboration between Rodarte , Westcott , and Aronofsky . Furthermore , the corps ballet 's costumes were designed by Zack Brown ( for the American Ballet Theatre ) , and slightly adapted by Westcott and her costume design department . Westcott said : " Controversy is too complimentary a word for two people using their considerable self @-@ publicising resources to loudly complain about their credit once they realized how good the film is .

 ABT dancer Sarah Lane served as a " dance double " for Portman in the film . In a March 3 blog entry for Dance Magazine , editor @-@ in @-@ chief Wendy Perron asked : " Do people really believe that it takes only one year to make a ballerina ? We know that Natalie Portman studied ballet as a kid and had a year of intensive training for the film , but that doesn 't add up to being a ballerina . However , it seems that many people believe that Portman did her own dancing in Black Swan . " This led to responses from Benjamin Millepied and Aronofsky , who both defended Portman as well as a response from Lane on the subject .

 The non @-@ original music featured in Black Swan consists of music by Tchaikovsky featuring performances on @-@ screen and in the soundtrack by violinist Tim Fain and a track of electronica dance music by English production duo The Chemical Brothers . It marks the fifth consecutive collaboration between Aronofsky and English composer Clint Mansell , who composed the original score for the film . Mansell attempted to score the film based on Tchaikovsky 's ballet but with radical changes to the music . Because of the use of Tchaikovsky 's music , the score was deemed ineligible to be entered into the 2010 Academy Awards for Best Original Score . 
 The Chemical Brothers ' music , which is featured prominently during the club scene in Black Swan , is omitted from the soundtrack album .

According to the website , the film 's critical consensus is , " <unk> intense , passionate , and wildly melodramatic , Black Swan glides on Darren Aronofsky 's bold direction — and a bravura performance from Natalie Portman . " At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 reviews from mainstream critics , the film received an average score of 79 based on 42 reviews , indicating " Generally favorable reviews " . 
 In September 2010 , Entertainment Weekly reported that based on reviews from the film 's screening at the Venice Film Festival , " [ Black Swan ] is already set to be one of the year 's most love @-@ it @-@ or @-@ hate @-@ it movies . " Leonard Maltin , on his blog Movie Crazy , admitted that he " couldn 't stand " the film , despite praising Natalie Portman 's performance . Reuters described the early response to the film as " largely positive " with Portman 's performance being highly praised . The Sydney Morning Herald reported that " the film divided critics . Some found its theatricality maddening , but most declared themselves ' swept away ' . " 
 Kurt Loder of Reason magazine called the film " wonderfully creepy " , and wrote that " it 's not entirely satisfying ; but it 's infused with the director 's usual creative brio , and it has a great dark gleaming look . " Mike Goodridge from Screen Daily called Black Swan " alternately disturbing and exhilarating " and described the film as a hybrid of The Turning Point and Polanski 's films Repulsion and Rosemary 's Baby . Goodridge described Portman 's performance , " [ She ] is captivating as Nina ... she captures the confusion of a repressed young woman thrown into a world of danger and temptation with frightening veracity . " The critic also commended Cassel , Kunis , and Hershey in their supporting roles , particularly comparing Hershey to Ruth Gordon in the role of " the desperate , jealous mother " . Goodridge praised Libatique 's cinematography with the dance scenes and the psychologically " unnerving " scenes : " It 's a mesmerising psychological ride that builds to a gloriously theatrical tragic finale as Nina attempts to deliver the perfect performance . " 
 Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review . He wrote , " [ Black Swan ] is an instant guilty pleasure , a gorgeously shot , visually complex film whose badness is what 's so good about it . You might howl at the sheer audacity of mixing mental illness with the body @-@ fatiguing , mind @-@ numbing rigors of ballet , but its lurid imagery and a <unk> competition between two rival dancers is pretty irresistible . " Honeycutt commended Millepied 's " sumptuous " choreography and Libatique 's " darting , weaving " camera work . The critic said of the thematic mashup , " Aronofsky ... never succeeds in wedding genre elements to the world of ballet ... White Swan / Black Swan dynamics almost work , but the horror @-@ movie nonsense drags everything down the rabbit hole of <unk> . " Similarly , in a piece for The Huffington Post , Rob Kirkpatrick praised Portman 's performance but compared the film 's story to that of Showgirls ( 1995 ) and Burlesque ( 2010 ) while concluding Black Swan is " simply higher @-@ priced cheese , Aronofsky 's <unk> to [ Burlesque director Steve ] Antin 's cheddar . 
 The film has been criticized for its portrayal of ballet and ballet dancers . Upon the film 's release in the United Kingdom , The Guardian interviewed four professional ballet dancers in the UK : Tamara Rojo , Lauren Cuthbertson , Edward Watson , and Elena <unk> . Rojo called the film " lazy ... featuring every ballet cliche going . " Watson felt that the film " makes [ ballet ] look so naff and laughable . It doesn 't show why ballet is so important to us – why we would want to try so hard . " The Canadian Press also reported that many Canadian ballet dancers felt that the film depicted dancers negatively and exaggerated elements of their lives but gave Portman high marks for her dance technique . In an interview with the Los Angeles Times , Gillian Murphy a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre praised the visual elements of the film but noted that the film presentation of the ballet world was " extreme .

 The Irene class was a class of protected cruisers built by the German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) in the late 1880s . The class comprised two ships , Irene and Prinzess Wilhelm ; they were the first protected cruisers built by the German Navy . As built , the ships were armed with a main battery of fourteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns and had a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . They were modernized in 1899 – 1905 , and their armament was upgraded with new , quick @-@ firing guns . 
 Both ships served in the East Asia station with the East Asia Squadron ; Prinzess Wilhelm played a major role in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay concession in November 1897 . Both ships returned to Germany at the turn of the 20th century , and remained in European waters until 1914 , when they were removed from active service . They were reduced to secondary roles then , and continued to serve until the early 1920s , when they were sold for scrap .

 Irene was the first protected cruiser built by the German navy . She was ordered under the contract name " Ersatz Elisabeth " and was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1886 . She was launched on 23 July 1887 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the German navy on 25 May 1888 . Prinzess Wilhelm was ordered under the contract name " Ersatz Ariadne " and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in 1886 . She was launched on 22 September 1887 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the German navy on 13 November 1889 . 
 Both Irene and Prinzess Wilhelm saw extensive service with the German fleet . Irene frequently escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II 's yacht on cruises throughout Europe . In 1894 , Irene was deployed to East Asian waters ; Prinzess Wilhelm joined her the following year . Prinzess Wilhelm was one of three ships involved in the seizure of the naval base Kiaochou Bay in November 1897 , led by Admiral Otto von Diederichs . Irene was in dock for engine maintenance at the time , and so she was not present during the operation . As a result of the seizure , the Cruiser Division was reorganized as the East Asia Squadron . Both ships were present in the Philippines in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Manila Bay between American and Spanish squadrons during the Spanish – American War in 1898 . Diederichs hoped to use the crisis as an opportunity to seize another naval base in the region , though this was unsuccessful . 
 Prinzess Wilhelm returned to Germany in 1899 and was modernized in 1899 – 1903 . Irene followed her sister back to Germany in 1901 , and was similarly modified in 1903 – 1905 . Both ships remained in service until early 1914 , when they were retired from front @-@ line service and used for secondary duties . Irene was converted into a submarine tender . She served in this capacity until 1921 , when she was sold for scrap and broken up the following year .

 Caloscypha is a fungal genus in the family <unk> ( order Pezizales ) . A monotypic genus , it contains the single species Caloscypha fulgens , commonly known as the spring orange peel fungus , the golden cup , or the dazzling cup . It is a cup fungus , typically up to 4 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) in diameter , with a bright to pale orange interior and orange ; specimens that are old or bruised often have an olive @-@ green discoloration , especially around the edges . In North America , it is usually found on the ground in forest litter near conifers . Fruiting occurs in early spring following snow melt . The asexual ( imperfect ) , or conidial stage of C. fulgens is the plant pathogenic species <unk> pyriforme , known to infect dormant seeds of the Sitka spruce . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 This species was first described by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1822 as Peziza fulgens , and has been grouped in several different genera since its original description . Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequence data shows that within the Pezizales order , Caloscypha fulgens belongs in an evolutionary lineage with the families Helvellaceae , Morchellaceae , and <unk> . Since 1968 , Caloscypha had been placed in the Pyronemataceae family , a small grouping of fungi distinguished from other Pezizales by their relatively undeveloped peridium . In 2002 , the new family <unk> was described to contain the monotypic genus Caloscypha . 
 The distinctive orange @-@ yellow color of the fungus has earned it the common names " spring orange peel fungus " , the " golden cup " , and the " dazzling cup " . The specific epithet means " bright colored " , while the genus name Caloscypha means " beautiful cup " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruiting body of C. fulgens is roughly cup @-@ shaped , although the cup may be somewhat flattened , lopsided or split ; the size is up to 4 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) in diameter . The inner surface of the cup is orange @-@ yellow , while the external surface is pale yellow . Either the margin around the rim or the entire outer surface may be stained olive @-@ green . The green or bluish staining that occurs upon injury or with age is unique within the Pezizales order . The stem , if present , is rather short . The spore deposit is white . 
 A single specimen of an albino form , 2 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter , was discovered in Northern Idaho ; it was found to be lacking the pigment responsible for staining the outer surface olive @-@ green . 
 The spores are translucent ( hyaline ) , roughly spherical , thin @-@ walled and smooth , with dimensions of 6 – 8 µm in diameter . The asci , the spore @-@ bearing cells , are cylindrical and 80 – 100 by 7 – 8 µm ; the paraphyses are thin and filamentous and contain orange granules . Edibility has not been recorded for this fungus . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 This species is usually found in the spring , often on duff under conifers shortly after the snow melts . In North America , where it has been noted to occur only between March and July , it is widespread in the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest . C. fulgens has been collected in Britain , and possibly arrived there from imported infected seeds . It has also been collected from Japan , Sweden , The Netherlands , and Turkey . It is listed on the Red List of protected species in Slovakia . 
 = = Imperfect state = = 
 The life cycle of this fungus allows for both an imperfect ( making asexual spores , or conidia ) or perfect ( making sexual spores ) form ; as has often happened in fungal taxonomy , the imperfect form was given a different name , because the relationship between the perfect and imperfect forms of the same species was not then known . The imperfect , or conidial stage of this fungus is the plant pathogen <unk> <unk> , first reported in 1964 , and known to infect dormant seeds of the Sitka spruce , Picea sitchensis . A 1978 study showed that about a third of Sitka spruce seed lots stored by the British Columbia Forest Service ( Canada ) contained diseased seeds , and these diseased seeds failed to germinate when sown in local nurseries . The fungus can grow at low temperatures , contributing to its ability to kill seeds before they have a chance to germinate . Infected seeds tend to shrivel and dry up rather than rot . It was also demonstrated that seed lots from squirrel seed caches have increased incidence of C. fulgens infection . Squirrels tend to cache <unk> repeatedly in the same location , and in cool , moist conditions favorable for fungus growth . In 2002 , G. pyriforme was found on imported conifer seeds in Germany , the first such report in continental Europe . 
 = = Similar species = = 
 Caloscypha fulgens bears some resemblance to the orange @-@ peel fungus ( Aleuria aurantia ) ; however , A. aurantia does not have the characteristic bluing reaction upon bruising or with age , and it fruits later in the season ( usually in autumn ) .

 Carruthers started his career progressing through the Northampton Town youth system . He was named in the first team squad for the 2000 – 01 season , when Northampton were in the Second Division following their promotion . He made his debut at the age of 17 as a half @-@ time substitute in a 2 – 0 defeat to Port Vale on 26 April 2001 and his first start came in a 3 – 0 defeat to Walsall on 5 May , finishing the season with three appearances . He signed his first professional contract with the club on 9 April 2002 . He managed to score his first goal for the club with a " spectacular " long @-@ range volley on 84 minutes in a 4 – 1 win against Wycombe Wanderers . This season , 2001 – 02 , Carruthers was able to make more of an impact , taking part in 14 games and scoring one goal . He received the first yellow card of his career during a 2 – 2 draw with Cambridge United in the FA Cup second round on 7 December 2002 . During the 2002 – 03 season , he cemented his place in the first team , playing 38 games . 
 He played for Northampton in a 3 – 0 defeat to Premier League team Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth round on 25 January 2004 , in which he conceded a penalty kick after two minutes . He signed a new contract with Northampton in February 2004 , which would expire in the summer of 2006 . He finished the 2003 – 04 season with 31 appearances . However , in the 2004 – 05 season , Carruthers fell out of favour at Northampton and he was made available to other clubs on loan . He joined Conference South team Hornchurch on a one @-@ month loan on 19 November 2004 , and after making his debut in a 2 – 1 defeat to Grays Athletic he finished the loan with four appearances . He joined Conference North leaders Kettering Town , his hometown club , on a one @-@ month loan on 21 January 2005 . His debut came in a 5 – 0 defeat to Southport and made one further appearance , completing the loan with two appearances before returning to Northampton . 
 = = = Bristol Rovers = = = 
 After returning he only managed to play one game before being loaned out again on 24 March 2005 , this time to League Two team Bristol Rovers , until the end of the season . He made his debut two days later as a substitute on 79 minutes in a 2 – 1 victory at Notts County . He stated his desire to stay at the club long @-@ term in April 2005 , saying " I do need a change , just to get myself going again really because it has been disappointing not playing . " He made his first start for the club in a 4 – 0 defeat at Scunthorpe United on 30 April 2005 . The loan expired in May after playing five times and he again expressed his desire to stay at the club . Wycombe Wanderers agreed to sign Carruthers on a two @-@ year contract on a free transfer on 16 June 2005 and Rovers manager Ian Atkins revealed his disappointment at not signing him , saying " He was high on my list . There are not many players who can play left @-@ back , wing @-@ back or as out @-@ and @-@ out wingers " . However , after speaking to Atkins and being guaranteed regular football , he decided to join Rovers instead on 29 June 2005 . 
 Carruthers scored for the first time in the 2005 – 06 season with the winning goal in a 1 – 0 victory at Grimsby Town on 10 December 2005 after scoring from a free kick on 80 minutes . He was a regular at the Memorial Stadium after signing permanently , appearing in 45 matches and scoring once in his first full season at the club . Ahead of the 2006 – 07 season , Carruthers said " We 've got a good set of players and have proved that – especially away against some of the top sides . We 're capable of getting results ; we just need to get that consistency " . He played in an FA Cup fourth round game against Championship team Derby County on 27 January 2007 , during which he cleared an Arturo Lupoli header off the line , although Rovers lost the game 1 – 0 . He played in both legs of Rovers ' play @-@ off semi @-@ final victory over Lincoln City , which finished 7 – 4 on aggregate . He played in the 2007 Football League Two play @-@ off Final at Wembley Stadium on 26 May 2007 , which Rovers won 3 – 1 against Shrewsbury Town , thus earning promotion into League One . He finished the season with 54 appearances and he agreed a new one @-@ year contract with the club in July 2007 . 
 Carruthers came on as a substitute on 76 minutes in a 2 – 2 draw at Premier League Fulham on 6 January 2008 . By February 2008 , he had been dislodged at left back by Joe Jacobson , although he made a return to the team for a 2 – 0 victory over Cheltenham Town after Jacobson was unavailable for selection . He made one more appearance before the end of the 2007 – 08 season , a 1 – 1 draw with former club Northampton on 12 March 2008 , and he finished the season with 24 appearances . He was released by the club on 14 May 2008 .

 = Airbus A330 = 
 The Airbus A330 is a medium to long range wide @-@ body twin @-@ engine jet airliner made by Airbus , a division of Airbus Group . Versions of the A330 have a range of 5 @,@ 600 to 13 @,@ 430 kilometres ( 3 @,@ 020 to 7 @,@ 250 nmi ; 3 @,@ 480 to 8 @,@ 350 mi ) and can accommodate up to 335 passengers in a two @-@ class layout or carry 70 tonnes ( 154 @,@ 000 lb ) of cargo . 
 The A330 's origin dates to the mid @-@ 1970s as one of several conceived derivatives of Airbus 's first airliner , the A300 . The A330 was developed in parallel with the four @-@ engine A340 , which shared many common airframe components but differed in number of engines . Both airliners incorporated fly @-@ by @-@ wire flight control technology , first introduced on an Airbus aircraft with the A320 , as well as the A320 's six @-@ display glass cockpit . In June 1987 , after receiving orders from various customers , Airbus launched the A330 and A340 . The A330 was Airbus 's first airliner that offered a choice of three engines : General Electric CF6 , Pratt & Whitney PW4000 , and Rolls @-@ Royce Trent 700 . 
 The A330 @-@ 300 , the first variant , took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered passenger service with Air Inter in January 1994 . Airbus followed up with the slightly shorter A330 @-@ 200 variant in 1998 . Subsequently developed A330 variants include a dedicated freighter , the A330 @-@ 200F , and a military tanker , the A330 MRTT . The A330 MRTT formed the basis of the proposed KC @-@ 45 , entered into the US Air Force 's KC @-@ X competition in conjunction with Northrop Grumman , where after an initial win , on appeal lost to Boeing 's tanker . 
 Since its launch , the A330 has allowed Airbus to expand market share in wide @-@ body airliners . Competing twinjets include the Boeing 767 and 777 , along with the 787 , which entered service in late 2011 . The long @-@ range Airbus A350 XWB was planned to succeed both the A330 and A340 . The current A330 ( referred to as the A330ceo ( current engine option ) since 2014 ) is to be replaced by the A330neo , which includes new engines and other improvements . As of May 2016 , A330ceo orders stand at 1 @,@ 448 , of which 1 @,@ 279 have been delivered and 1 @,@ 253 remain in operation . The largest operator is Turkish Airlines with 59 A330s in its fleet . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Airbus 's first airliner , the A300 , was envisioned as part of a diverse family of commercial aircraft . In pursuit of this goal , studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300 . Before introducing the A300 , Airbus identified nine possible variations named <unk> through B9 . A tenth variant , the <unk> , was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310 . Airbus then focused its efforts on single @-@ aisle ( SA ) studies , conceiving of a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family , the first commercial aircraft with digital fly @-@ by @-@ wire controls . During the SA studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide @-@ body aircraft market , simultaneously working on both projects . 
 In the mid @-@ 1970s Airbus began development of the <unk> , a larger derivative of the A300 , which would eventually become the A330 . The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing , coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available . It was targeted at the growing demand for high @-@ capacity , medium @-@ range , transcontinental trunk routes . Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC @-@ 10 but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency , the B9 was seen as a viable replacement for the DC @-@ 10 and the Lockheed L @-@ 1011 TriStar trijets . It was also considered as a medium @-@ ranged successor to the A300 . 
 At the same time , a 200 @-@ seat four @-@ engine version , the B11 ( which would eventually become the A340 ) was also under development . The B11 was originally planned to take the place of narrow @-@ body Boeing 707s and Douglas DC @-@ 8s then in commercial use , but would later evolve to target the long @-@ range , wide @-@ body trijet replacement market . To differentiate from the SA series , the B9 and B11 were re @-@ designated as the TA9 and TA11 , with TA standing for " twin aisle " . Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same fuselage and wing , with projected savings of US $ 500 million . Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and , more importantly , those of prospective customers ; twinjets were favoured in North America , quad @-@ jets desired in Asia , and operators had mixed views in Europe . Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines due to their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine . As a result , development plans prioritised the four @-@ engined TA11 ahead of the TA9 . 
 = = = Design effort = = = 
 The first specifications for the TA9 and TA11 , aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one @-@ class layout , emerged in 1982 . They showed a large underfloor cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen <unk> cargo containers in the forward , and four pallets or fourteen <unk> in the aft hold — double the capacity of the Lockheed L @-@ 1011 TriStar or DC @-@ 10 , and 8 @.@ 46 metres ( 27 @.@ 8 ft ) longer than the Airbus A300 . By June 1985 , the TA9 and TA11 had received more improvements , including the adoption of the A320 flight deck , digital fly @-@ by @-@ wire ( FBW ) control system , and side @-@ stick control . Airbus had developed a common cockpit for their aircraft models to allow quick transition by pilots . The flight crews could transition from one type to another after only one week 's training , which reduces operator costs . The two <unk> would use the vertical stabiliser , rudder , and circular fuselage sections of the A300 @-@ 600 , extended by two barrel sections . 
 Airbus briefly considered the variable camber wing , a concept that requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight . Studies were carried out by British Aerospace ( BAe ) , now part of BAE Systems , at Hatfield and Bristol . Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency , but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development . A true laminar flow wing ( a low @-@ drag shape that improves fuel efficiency ) was also considered but rejected . 
 From the beginning of the TA9 's development , a choice of engines from the three major engine manufacturers , Rolls @-@ Royce , Pratt & Whitney , and GE Aviation , was planned . GE Aviation first offered the General Electric CF6 @-@ 80C2 . However , later studies indicated that more thrust was needed to increase the initial power capability from 267 to 289 kN ( 60 @,@ 000 to 65 @,@ 000 lbf ) . GE enlarged the CF6 @-@ 80C2 fan from 236 to 244 centimetres ( 92 @.@ 9 to 96 @.@ 1 in ) to create the CF6 @-@ <unk> , giving a new thrust output of 300 – 320 kN ( 67 @,@ 000 – 72 @,@ 000 lbf ) . Rolls @-@ Royce initially wanted to use the 267 kN ( 60 @,@ 000 lbf ) Trent 600 to power Airbus 's newest twinjet and the upcoming McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 11 . However , the company later agreed to develop an engine solely for the A330 , the Trent 700 , with a larger diameter and 311 kN ( 69 @,@ 900 lbf ) of thrust . Similarly , Pratt & Whitney signed an agreement that covered the development of the A330 @-@ only <unk> . The company increased the fan size to augment power , enabling the engine to deliver 311 kN ( 69 @,@ 900 lbf ) of thrust . 
 On 27 January 1986 , the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in Munich , West Germany . Afterwards , the board chairman , Franz Josef Strauß , released a statement that said , " Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9 , which is now officially designated the A330 , and the TA11 , now called the A340 , with potential launch customer airlines , and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments " . The designations were originally reversed ; they were switched so the quad @-@ jet airliner would have a " 4 " in its name . Airbus hoped for five airlines to sign for both the A330 and A340 , and on 12 May sent sale proposals to the most likely candidates , including Lufthansa and Swissair . 
 = = = Production and testing = = = 
 In preparation to produce the A330 and A340 , Airbus 's partners invested heavily in new facilities . In England , BAe made a £ 7 million investment in a three @-@ storey technical centre with 15 @,@ 000 m2 ( 161 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of floor area at Filton . BAe also spent £ 5 million on a new production line at its Broughton wing production plant . In Germany , Messerschmitt @-@ <unk> @-@ Blohm ( MBB ) invested <unk> million ( $ 225 million ) on manufacturing facilities in the Weser estuary , including at Bremen , <unk> , <unk> , and Hamburg . France saw the biggest investments , with Aérospatiale constructing a new <unk> billion ( $ 411 million ) final @-@ assembly plant adjacent to Toulouse @-@ Blagnac Airport in <unk> ; by November 1988 , the pillars for the new Clément Ader assembly hall had been erected . The assembly process featured increased automation , such as robots drilling holes and installing fasteners during the wing @-@ to @-@ fuselage mating process . 
 On 12 March 1987 , Airbus received the first orders for the twinjet . The domestic French airline Air Inter placed five firm orders and fifteen options , while Thai Airways International requested eight aircraft , split evenly between firm orders and options . Airbus announced the next day that it would formally launch the A330 and A340 programmes by April 1987 , with deliveries of the A340 to begin in May 1992 and A330 deliveries to start in 1993 . Northwest Airlines signed a letter of intent for twenty <unk> and ten A330s on 31 March . 
 BAe eventually received £ 450 million of funding from the UK government , well short of the £ 750 million it had originally requested for the design and construction of the wings . The German and French governments also provided funding . Airbus issued subcontracts to companies in Australia , Austria , Canada , China , Greece , Italy , India , Japan , South Korea , Portugal , the United States , and the former Yugoslavia . With funding in place , Airbus launched the A330 and A340 programmes on 5 June 1987 , just prior to the Paris Air Show . At that time , the order book stood at 130 aircraft from ten customers , including lessor International Lease Finance Corporation ( ILFC ) . Of the order total , forty @-@ one were for A330s . In 1989 , Asian carrier Cathay Pacific joined the list of purchasers , ordering nine A330s and later increasing this number to eleven . 
 The wing @-@ to @-@ fuselage mating of the first A330 , the tenth airframe of the A330 and A340 line , began in mid @-@ February 1992 . This aircraft , coated with anti @-@ corrosion paint , was rolled out on 31 March without its General Electric CF6 @-@ <unk> engines , which were installed by August . During a static test , the wing failed just below requirement , BAe engineers later solved the problem . At the 1992 Farnborough Airshow , Northwest deferred delivery of sixteen A330s to 1994 , following the cancellation of its A340 orders . 
 The first completed A330 was rolled out on 14 October 1992 , with the maiden flight following on 2 November . Weighing 181 @,@ 840 kg ( 401 @,@ 000 lb ) , including 20 @,@ 980 kg ( 46 @,@ 300 lb ) of test equipment , the A330 became the biggest twinjet to have flown , until the later first flight of the Boeing 777 . The flight lasted five hours and fifteen minutes during which speed , height , and other flight configurations were tested . Airbus intended the test flight programme to comprise six aircraft flying a total of 1 @,@ 800 hours . On 21 October 1993 , the Airbus A330 received the European Joint Aviation Authorities ( JAA ) and US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) certifications simultaneously after 1 @,@ 114 cumulative airborne test hours and 426 test flights . At the same time , weight tests came in favourable , showing the plane was 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) under weight . 
 On 30 June 1994 , trouble struck during certification of the Pratt & Whitney engine when an A330 crashed near Toulouse . Both pilots and the five passengers died . The flight was designed to test autopilot response during a one @-@ engine @-@ off worst @-@ case scenario with the centre of gravity near its aft limit . Shortly after takeoff , the pilots had difficulty setting the autopilot , and the aircraft lost speed and crashed . An investigation by an internal branch of Direction Generale d 'Aviation concluded that the accident resulted from slow response and incorrect actions by the crew during the recovery . This led to a revision of A330 operating procedures .

 Air Inter became the first operator of the A330 , putting the aircraft into service on 17 January 1994 between Orly Airport , Paris , and Marseille . Deliveries to Malaysia Airlines ( MAS ) and Thai Airways International were postponed to address delamination of the composite materials in the <unk> engine 's thrust reverser assembly . Thai Airways received its first A330 during the second half of the year , operating it on routes from Bangkok to Taipei and Seoul . Cathay Pacific received its Trent 700 A330s following the certification of that engine on 22 December 1994 . MAS received its A330 on 1 February 1995 and then rescheduled its other ten orders . 
 Airbus intended the A330 to compete in the Extended @-@ range Twin @-@ engine Operation Performance Standards ( ETOPS ) market , specifically with the Boeing 767 . ( ETOPS is a standard that allows longer range flights away from a diversion airport for aircraft that have met special design and testing standards . ) Instead of the " ETOPS out of the box " or " Early ETOPS " approach taken by Boeing with its 777 , Airbus gradually increased ETOPS approval on the A330 using in @-@ service experience . Airbus suggested that the A340 and A330 were essentially identical except for their engine number , and that the A340 's experience could be applied to the A330 's ETOPS approval . The plans were for all three engine types to enter service with 90 @-@ minute approval , before increasing to 120 minutes after the total A330 fleet accumulated 25 @,@ 000 flight hours , and then to 180 minutes after 50 @,@ 000 flight hours , in 1995 . Aer Lingus and Cathay Pacific were two important airlines assisting Airbus in this endeavour by building up in @-@ service flight hours on over @-@ ocean flights . In November 2009 , the A330 became the first aircraft to receive ETOPS – 240 approval , which has since been offered by Airbus as an option . 
 = = = Further developments = = = 
 In response to a decline in A330 @-@ 300 sales , increased market penetration by the Boeing 767 @-@ 300ER , and airline requests for increased range and smaller aircraft , Airbus developed the Airbus A330 @-@ 200 . Known as the <unk> and <unk> during development , the A330 @-@ 200 would offer nine per cent lower operating costs than the Boeing 767 @-@ 300ER . The plane was aimed at the 11 @,@ 900 km ( 6 @,@ 430 nmi ; 7 @,@ 390 mi ) sector , where Airbus predicted demand for 800 aircraft between 1995 and 2015 . The project , with US $ 450 million in expected development costs , was approved by the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board on 24 November 1995 . 
 The A330 @-@ 200 first flew on 13 August 1997 . The sixteen @-@ month certification process involved logging 630 hours of test flights . The A330 @-@ 200 's first customer was ILFC ; these aircraft were leased by Canada 3000 , who became the type 's first operator . 
 As Airbus worked on its A330 @-@ 200 , hydraulic pump problems were reported by both A330 and A340 operators . This issue was the suspected cause of a fire that destroyed an Air France A340 @-@ 200 in January 1994 . On 4 January that year , a Malaysia Airlines A330 @-@ 300 , while undergoing regular maintenance at Singapore Changi Airport , was consumed by a fire that started in the right @-@ hand main undercarriage well . The incident caused US $ 30 million in damage , and the aircraft took six months to repair . Consequently , operators were advised to disable electrical pumps in January 1997 . 
 Several in @-@ flight shutdowns of Trent 700 – powered A330 @-@ 300s occurred . On 11 November 1996 , engine failure on a Cathay Pacific flight forced it back to Ho Chi Minh City . On 17 April 1997 , Cathay Pacific 's subsidiary Dragonair experienced an engine shutdown on an A330 , caused by carbon clogging the oil filter . As a result , Cathay Pacific self @-@ suspended its 120 @-@ minute ETOPS clearance . Another engine failure occurred on 6 May during climbout with a Cathay Pacific A330 , due to a bearing failure in a Hispano @-@ Suiza @-@ built gearbox . Three days later , a Cathay Pacific A330 on climbout during a Bangkok – Hong Kong flight experienced an oil pressure drop and a resultant engine spool down , forcing a return to Bangkok . The cause was traced to metal contamination in the engine 's master chip . Following a fifth engine failure on 23 May , Cathay Pacific and Dragonair voluntarily grounded their A330 fleets for two weeks , causing major disruption as Cathay 's eleven A330s made up fifteen per cent of its passenger capacity . Rolls @-@ Royce and Hispano @-@ Suiza developed a redesigned lubrication system to resolve the problem . 
 Responding to lagging A300 @-@ 600F and <unk> sales , Airbus began marketing the Airbus A330 @-@ 200F , a freighter derivative of the A330 @-@ 200 , around 2001 . The freighter has a range of 7 @,@ 400 km ( 4 @,@ 000 nmi ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) with a 65 tonnes ( 140 @,@ 000 lb ) payload , or 5 @,@ 900 km ( 3 @,@ 200 nmi ; 3 @,@ 700 mi ) with 70 tonnes ( 150 @,@ 000 lb ) . The plane utilises the same <unk> as the passenger version , however it is attached lower in the fuselage and housed in a distinctive bulbous " blister fairing " . This raises the aircraft 's nose so that the cargo deck is level during loading , as the standard A330 's landing gear results the plane having a nose @-@ down attitude while on the ground . 
 The A330 @-@ 200F made its maiden flight on 5 November 2009 . This marked the start of a four @-@ month , 180 @-@ hour certification programme . JAA and FAA certifications were expected by March the following year although approval by the JAA was delayed until April . The first delivery was subsequently made to the Etihad Airways cargo division , Etihad Cargo , in July 2010 . 
 Airbus announced in February 2011 that it intended to raise production rates from seven @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half to eight per month to nine per month in 2012 , and ten per month in 2013 . Production increased to 10 aircraft per month in April 2013 , the highest for an Airbus widebody aircraft . In 2012 , Airbus expected the A330 to continue selling until at least 2020 , with the A350 @-@ 900 expected to replace the A330 @-@ 300 . 
 On 19 July 2013 , Airbus delivered the 1000th A330 to Cathay Pacific . It is the first Airbus wide @-@ body airliner to reach 1 @,@ 000 deliveries , and the fourth wide @-@ body to achieve the milestone after the Boeing 747 , 767 and 777 . As of May 2016 , a total of 1 @,@ 448 <unk> had been ordered , with 1 @,@ 279 delivered . 
 On 25 September 2013 at the Aviation Expo China ( Beijing Airshow ) , Airbus announced a new lower weight A330 @-@ 300 variant , optimised for use on domestic and regional routes in high growth markets with large populations and concentrated traffic flows ; China and India were recognised as prime targets . This variant could carry up to 400 passengers . The increased efficiency , however , comes more from the installation of more seats than any weight reduction . On relatively short , yet congested routes , the A330 competes against single @-@ aisle jetliners . While the A330 's operating costs in those conditions is not far above those of the Boeing 737 or Airbus A321 , the A320neo and 737 MAX promise more efficiency . Where the frequency of flights cannot be increased , using larger aircraft , such as the A330 , is the only available option to increase capacity . The first customer for the A330 regional was announced as Saudia at the 2015 Paris Air Show . 
 In December 2014 , Airbus announced that it would reduce A330 production to nine aircraft per month from ten , because of falling orders . Airbus did not rule out further production cuts . The announcement led to an immediate drop in Airbus Group 's stock price because the company derives a significant percentage of its cash flow and net profit from the A330 program ; the A330 's financial impact is magnified amid problems in the A350 and A380 programs . In February 2015 , Airbus announced another production rate cut to six aircraft per month beginning in the first quarter of 2016 . This extends A330ceo production to July 2017 , allowing for a smooth transition to A330neo production , which is set to start in Spring 2017 . In February 2016 Airbus announced , that it will re @-@ increase the production rate from 6 to 7 per month , as response to new A330 orders . 
 = = = A330neo = = = 
 Airbus ' management has been studying whether to equip the A330 with newer , more efficient engines : " new engine option " or NEO . Airbus sales chief John Leahy 's argument is that the lower purchase price of an A330 even without new engines make the economics of buying an A330 competitive at midrange routes with that of the Boeing 787 . Leahy stated that " we just reduced the capital costs by 25 % " in July 2014 . Candidate engines include variants of Rolls @-@ Royce 's Trent 1000 and General Electric 's <unk> @-@ 1B . Both engine makers are reportedly interested in winning an exclusive deal should a re @-@ engined A330 be offered . The Trent 1000 TEN ( Thrust , Efficiency , New Technology ) engine is under development for the 787 @-@ 10 , but Rolls @-@ Royce intends to offer it for a number of aircraft . Both engines are heavier than the A330 's existing engines , so Airbus will have to strengthen the wings to accept them . 
 Airbus believes the A330neo derives much of its market advantage from being a less expensive widebody positioned to serve high density routes shorter than 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles that otherwise would be served by aircraft primarily designed for routes of 8 @,@ 000 miles . Ed <unk> , editor of Airline Monitor , told Aviation Week that the A330neo could create a monopoly in that segment , because the 767 is " essentially out of production " and the only other aircraft suited for it is the Boeing 757 ; the largest 737 does not have the passenger capacity to compete effectively . At the low end of the market , that is , the shortest of these routes , the Boeing 787 @-@ 8 is at a disadvantage , notes one analyst , because its purchase price is higher than the A330neo 's and its operating economics are tuned for longer flights . 
 Airbus ' recent customer , AirAsiaX , which ordered 25 A330 aircraft in December 2013 , has pushed Airbus to develop a re @-@ engined A330 that would boast a substantially lower fuel burn , as has Delta Air Lines with its request for proposals to replace its 747 @-@ 400s and 767 @-@ 300ER fleets . AirAsiaX believes that the A330neo will give the airline a second chance to establish a profitable flight schedule connecting Kuala Lumpur to London and Paris ; in 2012 , AirAsiaX 's first attempt failed to make money because the Airbus A340 employed proved to be far too fuel inefficient . CIT believes an A330neo service on short to medium haul routes , carrying 250 – 300 passengers , can produce higher profit margins than either the A350 or the 787 , due to the latter two 's higher purchase cost as a result of their optimisation for longer routes . It specifically cites the A350 @-@ 800 as " not as efficient as they 'd like . " On the other hand , Steven Udvar @-@ Hazy , chairman of Air Lease Corp. does not accept that reasoning , telling Aviation Week " We don 't believe it is rational for us to take the A350 @-@ 800 and the A330neo ... I don 't see the A350 @-@ 800 surviving if ( Airbus ) does the A330neo . " 
 Prolonging the production run of the A330 with the neo may help Airbus maintain profitability as it transitions to the A350 , the first model transition Airbus has had to manage . A major upgrade program for the A330 could also cause problems for Airbus . The re @-@ engined A330 would be launched into a twin @-@ aisle market already crowded by the Boeing 787 , 777X , and Airbus A350 , and could take sales from other Airbus aircraft . Starting the A330neo program would likely result in a short @-@ term drop in A330 sales , Airbus ' most profitable program , as customers wait for the new version . Airbus is also considering re @-@ engining the A380 , but running two costly upgrade programs at the same time could overwhelm the company 's resources . Emirates ' recent cancellation of a 70 @-@ plane order for the A350 may place more urgency on the decision . 
 Airbus announced the A330 @-@ 800neo and A330 @-@ 900neo variants at the Farnborough Airshow on 14 July 2014 . Both variants are to have a maximum take @-@ off weight of 242 t . The design is planned to be frozen for the type in 2015 . Rolls Royce will be the exclusive engine supplier ; when Airbus announced the A330neo project , both Rolls Royce and General Electric insisted on exclusivity as a condition of offering favorable terms . Rolls Royce offered better terms . The A330 @-@ 900neo is to be introduced in the fourth quarter of 2017 , while the 252 @-@ seat A330 @-@ 800neo is to be introduced in early 2018 . Aerodynamic modifications are to include a re @-@ twisted wing and optimised slats . A350 @-@ style wing @-@ tips will increase the wingspan by 3 @.@ 7 m to 64 m . Airbus predicted a 14 % fuel consumption reduction per seat . This is for the new − 900neo compared to the previous 235 @-@ tonne − 300 version , it is 8 @.@ 5 % more efficient per seat against the newer 242 @-@ tonne − 300 , and is also due to 10 additional seats from a new galley design : the block fuel burn is 5 @.@ 1 % lower . Compared to the 235 @-@ tonne version , the larger 112 @-@ inch Trent 7000 is 11 % more efficient than the 97 @-@ inch previous engine , and the aerodynamic optimizations offers a 4 % gain , countering a 2 % loss due to increased weight and 1 % due to additional drag from the larger engine . Fuel consumption per seat is additionally improved by 2 % due to the rearranged cabin ( Space @-@ Flex and Smart @-@ <unk> ) with increased seating . 
 The decision to offer the aircraft with only one engine is somewhat controversial but not unique to Airbus ; the Boeing 777X will come equipped exclusively with General Electric engines . On the one hand , airlines bemoan the loss of competition among engine makers ; Steven Udvar @-@ Hazy , CEO of Air Lease Corp. , said that he wants a choice of engines . On the other hand , Airbus has pointed out that equipping a commercial aircraft to handle more than one type of engine adds millions of dollars to the purchase price . A Pratt and Whitney executive told the Wall Street Journal , " Engines are no longer commodities ... the optimization of the engine and the aircraft becomes more relevant . " 
 On 16 January 2016 , officials from Iran signed an agreement with Airbus for 118 new aircraft , including 27 A330ceo family and 18 A330neo ( -900 ) . The Motley Fool noted on 9 July 2016 , that this order still awaits export licenses . Airbus has 126 unfilled orders for the A330neo as of June 2016 ; 66 are from AirAsiaX , an unprofitable airline which has been forced to defer deliveries over ten years . The Fool noted the urgent need for Airbus to pick up additional customers , to save the A330 program . 
 = = Design = = 
 The A330 is a medium @-@ size , wide @-@ body airliner , with two engines suspended on pylons under the wings . A two @-@ wheel nose undercarriage and two four @-@ wheel bogie main legs built by Messier @-@ Dowty support the airplane on the ground . Its maximum takeoff weight ( MTOW ) grew from 212 tonnes ( 467 @,@ 000 lb ) at introduction to 242 tonnes ( 534 @,@ 000 lb ) in 2015 , enhancing its payload @-@ range performance , with a 0 @.@ 9 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 980 lb ) heavier Maximum Ramp Weight ( <unk> ) . 
 The airframe of the A330 features a low @-@ wing cantilever monoplane with a wing virtually identical to that of the A340 . The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe , which developed a long slender wing with a very high aspect ratio to provide high aerodynamic efficiency . The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and , along with other design features , allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0 @.@ 86 . The wing has a very high thickness @-@ to @-@ chord ratio of 12 @.@ 8 per cent , which means that a long span and high aspect ratio can be attained without a severe weight penalty . For comparison , the rival MD @-@ 11 has a thickness @-@ to @-@ chord ratio of 8 – 9 per cent . Each wing also has a 2 @.@ 74 m ( 8 @.@ 99 ft ) tall winglet instead of the wingtip fences found on earlier Airbus aircraft . 
 The shared wing design with the A340 allowed the A330 to incorporate aerodynamic features developed for the former aircraft . The failure of International Aero Engines ' radical ultra @-@ high @-@ bypass V2500 " <unk> " , which had promised around 15 per cent fuel burn reduction for the A340 , led to multiple enhancements including wing upgrades to compensate . Originally designed with a 56 m ( 180 ft ) span , the wing was later extended to 58 @.@ 6 m ( 190 ft ) and finally to 60 @.@ 3 m ( 200 ft ) . At 60 @.@ 3 m ( 200 ft ) , the wingspan is similar to that of the larger Boeing 747 – 200 , but with 35 percent less wing area . 
 The A330 and A340 fuselage is based on that of the Airbus A300 @-@ 600 , with many common parts , and has the same external and cabin width : 5 @.@ 64 m ( 19 ft ) and 5 @.@ 28 m ( 17 ft ) . Allowed seating arrangements are 2 – 2 – 2 six @-@ abreast in first class , 2 – 3 – 2 seven @-@ abreast in business class , 2 – 4 – 2 eight @-@ abreast in economy class , or 3 @-@ 3 @-@ 3 nine @-@ abreast in high @-@ density economy class . The vertical stabiliser and rudder are made mostly of composite materials . When necessary , the A330 uses the Honeywell 331 – <unk> auxiliary power unit ( APU ) to provide pneumatics and electrical power . 
 The A330 shares the same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and A340 , featuring electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges . Instead of a conventional control yoke , the flight deck features side @-@ stick controls , six main displays , and the Electronic Flight Instrument System ( EFIS ) , which covers navigation and flight displays , as well as the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor ( <unk> ) . Apart from the flight deck , the A330 also has the fly @-@ by @-@ wire system common to the A320 family , the A340 , the A350 , and the A380 . It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems , as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents manoeuvres from exceeding the aircraft 's aerodynamic and structural limits .

 With launch of Airbus A330neo , the existing members of the Airbus A330 family ( A330 @-@ 200 , 200F , 300 , and MRTT ) received the Airbus A330ceo ( " current engine option " ) name .

 The A330 @-@ 200 is a shortened , longer @-@ range variant , which entered service in 1998 with Korean Air . Typical range with 253 passengers in a three @-@ class configuration is 13 @,@ 400 km ( 7 @,@ 240 nmi ; 8 @,@ 330 mi ) . The A330 @-@ 200 is ten fuselage frames shorter than the original − 300 , with a length of 58 @.@ 82 m ( 193 ft 0 in ) . To compensate for the smaller moment arm of the shorter fuselage , the vertical stabiliser height of the − 200 was increased by 104 cm ( 40 @.@ 9 in ) . The − 200 's wing was also modified ; structural strengthening of the wing allowed the maximum takeoff weight of the − 200 to be increased to 229 @.@ 8 tonnes ( 507 @,@ 000 lb ) . The − 200 is offered with three engine types similar to those found on the − 300 , namely the General Electric CF6 @-@ 80E , Pratt & Whitney PW4000 , or Rolls @-@ Royce Trent 700 . Airbus also boosted fuel capacity to 139 @,@ 100 L ( 36 @,@ 700 US gal ) by adding the centre section fuel tank , standard in the A340 . 
 A new vertical stabilizer was introduced in 2004 beginning with MSN 555 . This newer fin is shorter in height by 50 cm ( 20 in ) and was derived from the design of the vertical stabilizer of the A340 @-@ 500 and <unk> , later becoming standard on all new A330 @-@ 200 . 
 In 2008 , Airbus released plans for a higher gross weight version of the A330 @-@ 200 to more effectively compete against the Boeing 787 Dreamliner . The new @-@ build A330 @-@ <unk> had a 5 tonne increase in Maximum Takeoff Weight , allowing a 560 kilometres ( 302 nmi ; 348 mi ) range increase and a 3 @.@ 4 tonnes ( 7 @,@ 500 lb ) payload increase . Korean Air became the first customer on 27 February 2009 with an order for six − <unk> . Deliveries of the first aircraft started in 2010 . 
 In mid @-@ 2012 , Airbus proposed another version of the − 200 with the maximum gross weight increased by 2 t to 240 t . This version will have its range extended by 270 nmi and will carry 2 @.@ 5 t more payload . It will see engine and aerodynamic improvements reducing its fuel burn by about 2 % . It is planned to enter the service by mid @-@ 2015 . In November 2012 , it was announced that the gross weight is to be further increased to 242 t with the range extended by 350 nmi ( over 238 t version ) . 
 As of May 2016 , 645 of the − 200 had been ordered , 586 of which had been delivered , with 578 aircraft in operation . The 2015 list price is $ 229 million . The − 200 competes with the Boeing 767 @-@ 300ER and to a lesser extent the 767 @-@ 400ER as well as with new 787 Dreamliner . The A330 @-@ 200 is also available as an ultra @-@ long @-@ range corporate jet as the A330 @-@ 200 Prestige . 
 = = = A330 @-@ 300 = = = 
 The A330 @-@ 300 is based on a stretched A300 fuselage 63 @.@ 69 m ( 208 ft 11 in ) long but with new wings , stabilisers and fly @-@ by @-@ wire systems . The − 300 carries 295 passengers in a three @-@ class cabin layout , 335 in two @-@ class , or up to 440 in an all @-@ economy layout . It has a range of 10 @,@ 500 km ( 5 @,@ 670 nmi ; 6 @,@ 520 mi ) . It has a large cargo capacity , comparable to that of early Boeing 747s . It is powered by the choice of two General Electric CF6 @-@ 80E , Pratt & Whitney PW4000 , or Rolls @-@ Royce Trent 700 engines , all of which are ETOPS @-@ 180 rated . The − 300 entered service in January 1994 . 
 In 2010 Airbus offered a new version of the − 300 with the maximum gross weight increased by two tonnes to 235 t . This enabled 120 nmi extension of the range as well as 1 @.@ 2 t increase in payload . In mid @-@ 2012 , Airbus proposed another increase of the maximum gross weight to 240 t . It is planned to be implemented by mid @-@ 2015 . This − 300 version will have the range extended by 400 nmi and will carry 5 t more payload . It will include engine and aerodynamic improvements reducing its fuel burn by about 2 % . In November 2012 , it was further announced that the gross weight will increase from 235 t to 242 t , and the range will increase by 500 nmi or 926 km or 575 mi to 6 @,@ 100 nmi ( 11 @,@ 300 km ; 7 @,@ 020 mi ) . Airbus is also planning to activate the central fuel tank for the first time for the − 300 model . 
 In September 2013 , Airbus announced a version of the A330 @-@ 300 , named A330 Regional . This version is to have seating for 400 passengers , with a reduced range of 3 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 560 km ; 3 @,@ 450 mi ) and a gross weight of approximately 200 t ( 441 @,@ 000 lb ) . 
 As of May 2016 , 761 <unk> had been ordered , 658 of which had been delivered , with 640 in operation . The 2015 list price is $ 253 @.@ 7 million . The closest competitors have been the Boeing 777 @-@ 200 / 200ER , and the now out @-@ of @-@ production McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 11 .

 The A330 @-@ 200F is an all @-@ cargo derivative of the A330 @-@ 200 capable of carrying 65 t ( 140 @,@ 000 lb ) over 7 @,@ 400 km ( 4 @,@ 000 nmi ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) or 70 tonnes ( 150 @,@ 000 lb ) up to 5 @,@ 900 km ( 3 @,@ 200 nmi ; 3 @,@ 700 mi ) . To overcome the standard A330 's nose @-@ down body angle on the ground , the <unk> uses a revised nose undercarriage layout to provide a level deck during cargo loading . The normal A330 @-@ 200 undercarriage is used , but its attachment points are lower in the fuselage , thus requiring a distinctive blister fairing on the nose to accommodate the retracted nose gear . Power is provided by two Pratt & Whitney PW4000 or Rolls @-@ Royce Trent 700 engines . General Electric does not plan to offer an engine for the A330 @-@ 200F . 
 As of May 2016 , Airbus had delivered 35 aircraft with seven unfilled orders . The list price is $ 203 @.@ 6 million . As well as new @-@ build freighters , Airbus has proposed passenger @-@ to @-@ freighter conversions of existing − 200 airliners . The A330 @-@ 200F is sized between the 767 @-@ 300F and 777F , but trails both Boeing models in orders and deliveries . 
 = = = A330 Converted Freighter = = = 
 In 2012 , Airbus announced plans for a passenger @-@ to @-@ freighter program with ST Aerospace . The A330 @-@ 300 and − 200 are to be part of the <unk> program with the − 300 to come first and the − 200 to follow a year later . Conversion work will be done mainly in Dresden , Germany . Qatar Airways has already showed interest in the program . The aircraft is expected to enter service in 2016 . 
 The A330 @-@ <unk> variant has a payload of 60 tonnes with the range of 2 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 000 km ) or 61 tonnes with the range of 3 @,@ 600 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 600 km ) for the higher MTOW variants . The A330 @-@ <unk> will carry the payload of up to 59 tons on ranges up to 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 400 km ) . Airbus estimates the market demand for the conversions at 900 units during the next 20 years .

 The Airbus A330 @-@ 900neo is to burn 14 % less fuel than A330 @-@ 300 on per seat basis ( on a 4 @,@ 000 nmi flight ) and will have 10 more seats ( 310 seats overall ) achieved with an interior reconfiguration to save space . Like the 800neo , it will be equipped with Trent 7000 engines with a 10 : 1 bypass delivering 320 kN ( 72 @,@ 000 lbf ) . The − 900neo is expected to enter service at the end of 2017 . On 19 November 2014 , Delta Air Lines became the first airline to announce a firm order for the Airbus A330neo by ordering 25 A330 @-@ 900neo aircraft . This order made the airline the official launch customer for the Airbus A330 @-@ 900neo .

 The Airbus A330 MRTT is the Multi @-@ Role Transport and Tanker ( MRTT ) version of the A330 @-@ 200 , designed for aerial refuelling and strategic transport . As of November 2014 , 46 total orders have been placed for the A330 MRTT by the air forces of Australia , France , Saudi Arabia , Singapore , the United Arab Emirates , and the United Kingdom .

 The EADS / Northrop Grumman KC @-@ 45 was a proposed version of the A330 MRTT for the United States Air Force ( USAF ) ' s KC @-@ X aerial refuelling programme . In February 2008 , the USAF selected the aircraft to replace the Boeing KC @-@ 135 Stratotanker . The replacement process was mired in controversy , instances of corruption , and allegations of favouritism . In July 2010 , EADS submitted a tanker bid to the USAF without Northrop Grumman as a partner . However , on 24 February 2011 , the USAF picked the Boeing KC @-@ 767 proposal , later named KC @-@ 46 , as the winner because of its lower cost .

 To compete with Boeing 's 7E7 ( later 787 ) , Airbus offered a minimum @-@ change derivative called the A330 @-@ <unk> in 2004 . As the name indicated , this proposed variant would have had a lower maximum takeoff weight of 202 tonnes ( 445 @,@ 000 lb ) , coupled with de @-@ rated engines , giving a range of 7 @,@ 400 km ( 4 @,@ 000 nmi ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) . It was aimed at Singapore Airlines , who had looked to replace its Airbus A310 @-@ 300s . The variant was also to be a replacement for Airbus A300 @-@ <unk> and early Boeing 767s . Airlines , however , were not satisfied with the compromised aircraft ; the company instead proceeded with an entirely new aircraft , the A350 XWB . 
 = = = = A330 @-@ 300HGW = = = = 
 In 2000 , it was reported that Airbus was studying an A330 @-@ 300 version with a higher gross weight . It was named A330 @-@ 300HGW and had a takeoff weight of 240 tonnes ( 530 @,@ 000 lb ) , 7 tonnes ( 15 @,@ 000 lb ) greater than the − 300 's weight . The version would have a strengthened wing and additional fuel capacity from a 41 @,@ 600 @-@ litre ( 11 @,@ 000 US gal ) centre section fuel tank . The A330 @-@ 300HGW 's range was increased to over 11 @,@ 000 km ( 5 @,@ 940 nmi ; 6 @,@ 840 mi ) . Among those that showed interest was leasing company ILFC , which sought airliners that could fly from the US West Coast to Europe . 
 Power was to be supplied by all three engines offered to the two other A330 passenger models . Airbus also considered using the new Engine Alliance GP7000 engine for the A330 @-@ 300HGW , which would have been the engine 's first twinjet application . The − 300HGW was to enter airline service in 2004 . However , the programme was not launched and quietly disappeared . The 240 @-@ tonne A330 would reappear years later when Airbus announced at the 2012 Farnborough Airshow that it would be an available option for both the A330 @-@ 300 and the A330 @-@ 200 . In November 2012 , the maximum take off weight was further increased to 242 tonnes ; the first of these aircraft was to enter service with Delta Air Lines in Q2 2015 . The A330neo also uses this MTOW . 
 = = = = A330 @-@ 500 = = = = 
 Also known as the A330 @-@ 100 , the A330 @-@ 500 was a proposed " shrink " of the A330 @-@ 200 version launched in July 2000 at the Farnborough Airshow , with eight fuselage frames removed – four ahead and four behind the wing . This would allow for the seating of 222 passengers . The − 500 's maximum takeoff weight was to be 228 tonnes ( 503 @,@ 000 lb ) , a 5 @-@ tonne ( 11 @,@ 000 lb ) decrease from the A330 @-@ 200 , allowing a range of 12 @,@ 970 km ( 7 @,@ 000 nmi ; 8 @,@ 060 mi ) . A lighter version , at 195 tonnes ( 430 @,@ 000 lb ) , would have flown up to 8 @,@ 060 km ( 4 @,@ 350 nmi ; 5 @,@ 010 mi ) . The aircraft would have had 5 per cent better specific fuel consumption than the A300 @-@ 600 , powered by either the CF6 @-@ <unk> , PW4000 , or the Trent 500 . 
 Prospective customers included ILFC , CIT Aerospace , Lufthansa , and Hapag @-@ Lloyd . The latter two , however , were unimpressed with the long @-@ range variant , preferring a shorter @-@ range aircraft , which was better suited to their route structure . Singapore Airlines was also an expected customer because it was looking for a replacement for the A310 . Airbus intended to freeze the design in late 2001 , with the first flight scheduled for the third quarter of 2003 and entry into service within a year . The programme was later abandoned , as interest from customers was lacking .

 = = Accidents and incidents = = 
 As of October 2015 , the Airbus A330 had been involved in 22 major aviation occurrences , including eight confirmed hull @-@ loss accidents and two hijackings , for a total of 339 fatalities . 
 The type 's first fatal accident occurred on 30 June 1994 near Toulouse on a test flight when an Airbus @-@ owned A330 @-@ 300 crashed while simulating an engine failure on climbout , killing all seven on board . Airbus subsequently advised A330 operators to disconnect the autopilot and limit pitch attitude in the event of an engine failure at low speed . 
 On 15 March 2000 , a Malaysia Airlines A330 @-@ 300 suffered fuselage damage from a leaked corrosive chemical that had been falsely labelled . The aircraft was written off . 
 The type 's second fatal accident , and first while in commercial service , occurred on 1 June 2009 when Air France Flight 447 , an A330 @-@ 200 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris with 228 people on board , crashed in the Atlantic Ocean 640 – 800 kilometres ( 346 – 432 nmi ; 398 – 497 mi ) northeast of the islands of Fernando de Noronha , with no survivors . Malfunctioning pitot tubes provided an early focus for the investigation , as the aircraft involved had Thales @-@ built " – AA " models known to record faulty airspeed data during icing conditions . In July 2009 , Airbus advised A330 and A340 operators to replace Thales <unk> with equivalents manufactured by Goodrich . Investigators later determined that the inadequate response of the pilots to both a loss of airspeed data from malfunctioning pitot tubes and subsequent autopilot disengagement resulted in Flight 447 entering into an aerodynamic stall . 
 On 12 May 2010 , Afriqiyah Airways Flight 771 , an A330 @-@ 200 , crashed on approach to Tripoli International Airport , Libya , on a flight from OR Tambo International Airport , Johannesburg , South Africa . Of the 104 people on board , all but one nine @-@ year @-@ old Dutch boy died . The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error . 
 The two hijackings involving the A330 have resulted in one fatality , namely the hijacker of Philippine Airlines Flight 812 on 25 May 2000 , who jumped out of the aircraft to his death . The hijacking of Sabena Flight 689 on 13 October 2000 ended with no casualties when Spanish police took control of the aircraft . On 24 July 2001 , two unoccupied SriLankan Airlines A330s were destroyed amid an attack on Bandaranaike International Airport , in Colombo , Sri Lanka , by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam . On 25 December 2009 , passengers and crew subdued a man who attempted to detonate explosives in his underwear on an A330 @-@ 300 operating Northwest Airlines Flight 253 . 
 Two A330 incidents due to in @-@ flight malfunctions were survived by all on board . On 24 August 2001 , Air Transat Flight 236 , an A330 @-@ 200 , developed a fuel leak over the Atlantic Ocean due to an incorrectly installed hydraulic part and was forced to glide for over 15 minutes to an emergency landing in the Azores . On 7 October 2008 , Qantas Flight 72 , an A330 @-@ 300 , suffered a rapid loss of altitude in two sudden uncommanded pitch @-@ down manoeuvres while 150 km ( 81 nmi ; 93 mi ) from the Learmonth air base in northwestern Australia . After declaring an emergency , the crew landed the aircraft safely at Learmonth . It was later determined that the incident , which caused 106 injuries , 14 of them serious , was the result of a design flaw of the plane 's Air Data Inertial Reference Unit and a limitation of the aircraft 's flight computer software . 
 On 13 April 2010 , Cathay Pacific Flight 780 from Surabaya Juanda International Airport to Hong Kong landed safely after both engines failed due to contaminated fuel . 57 passengers were injured . Its two pilots received the Polaris Award from the International Federation of Air Line Pilots ' Associations , for their heroism and airmanship . 
 On 15 July 2014 , a Libyan Airlines A330 was severely damaged in the fighting in Libya and sustained bullet holes in the fuselage . On 20 July 2014 , two Afriqiyah Airways Airbus A330 were hit by an RPG at Tripoli International Airport . One was completely destroyed in the ensuing fire .

 = X @-@ Men : The Last Stand = 
 X @-@ Men : The Last Stand is a 2006 American superhero film , based on the X @-@ Men superhero team introduced in Marvel Comics . The film , distributed by 20th Century Fox , is the sequel to 2003 's X2 and the third installment in the X @-@ Men film series . It was directed by Brett Ratner , written by Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn , and features an ensemble cast , including Hugh Jackman , Halle Berry , Ian McKellen , Famke Janssen , Anna Paquin , Kelsey Grammer , James Marsden , Rebecca Romijn , Shawn Ashmore , Aaron Stanford , Vinnie Jones , and Patrick Stewart . The film 's script is loosely based on two X @-@ Men comic book story arcs : " The Dark Phoenix Saga " by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne , and " Gifted " by writer Joss Whedon and artist John Cassaday , with a plot that revolves around a " mutant cure " that causes serious repercussions among mutants and humans , and on the resurrection of Jean Grey . 
 Bryan Singer , who had directed the two previous films , X @-@ Men ( 2000 ) and X2 , decided to leave to work on Superman Returns , as he had not even defined the storyline for a third film . Matthew Vaughn , who was initially hired as the new director , left due to personal and professional issues , and was replaced with Ratner . Filming began in August 2005 with a budget of $ 210 million , and was consequently the most expensive film at the time of its release . It had extensive visual effects created by 11 different companies . 
 X @-@ Men : The Last Stand was released on May 26 , 2006 , to commercial success . It grossed approximately $ 459 million worldwide , becoming the seventh @-@ highest grossing film of 2006 ; it was at the time the highest @-@ grossing film in the series and currently the fourth @-@ highest @-@ grossing film of the franchise . Critical reception was mixed , with the acting and the action scenes receiving positive notice , and criticism directed at the screenplay , and overuse of characters and style . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Worthington Labs announces it has developed an inoculation to suppress the X @-@ gene that gives mutants their abilities , and offer the " cure " to any mutant who wants it . The cure is created from the genome of a young mutant named Jimmy , who lives at the Worthington facility on Alcatraz Island . While some mutants are interested in the cure , including the X @-@ Men 's Rogue , many others are horrified by the announcement . In response to the news , Lehnsherr , now known as Magneto , reestablishes his Brotherhood of Mutants with mutants who oppose the cure , warning his followers that the cure will be forcefully used to exterminate the mutant race . 
 With help from Pyro , Magneto recruits Callisto , and several other mutants . They attack the mobile prison holding Mystique to free her , also freeing Juggernaut and Multiple Man . Mystique saves Magneto by taking a shot of the mutant cure aimed at him , rendering her human . Hateful of humans , Magneto abandons Mystique , much to her shock . Meanwhile , Cyclops , still distraught over the loss of his fiancée , Jean Grey , drives to her resting location at Alkali Lake . Jean appears to Cyclops but , as the two kiss , Jean disintegrates him . Sensing trouble , Xavier sends Wolverine and Storm to investigate . When they arrive , they find only telekinetically floating rocks , Cyclops ' glasses , and an unconscious Jean . 
 When they return to the X @-@ Mansion , Xavier explains to Wolverine that when Jean sacrificed herself , she also freed the " Phoenix " , a powerful alternate personality which Xavier had telepathically repressed , fearing the Phoenix 's destructive potential . Wolverine is disgusted to learn of this psychic tampering with Jean 's mind but , once she awakens , he discovers that she killed Cyclops and is not the Jean Grey he once knew . The Phoenix emerges , knocks out Wolverine , and escapes to her childhood home . 
 Magneto learns of Jean 's resurrection through Callisto , and the X @-@ Men arrive at the Grey home at the same time as the Brotherhood . Magneto and Xavier go in alone , and both vie for Jean 's loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces . She destroys the house and disintegrates Xavier before leaving with Magneto . The Brotherhood decides to strike Worthington Labs , and the government sends multiple teams to attack the Brotherhood 's base in the forest , with information gained from Mystique , furious over Magneto 's betrayal . However , the life forms in the camp are all copies of Multiple Man , and Magneto uses his powers to move the Golden Gate Bridge so he and his army can get to Alcatraz and facilitate the attack on Worthington Labs . The remaining X @-@ Men confront the Brotherhood , despite being significantly outnumbered , and arrive just as the military troops who thus far have been neutralizing the attacking mutants are overwhelmed by the Brotherhood . 
 During the fight , Kitty saves Jimmy from the Juggernaut , who had been sent to kill him . Wolverine has Colossus throw him at Magneto and distracting him long enough for Beast to inject Magneto with the " cure " and thus nullifying his powers . Army reinforcements arrive and shoots at Jean just as Wolverine had calmed her down . Phoenix is awakened by the attack and disintegrates the troops in retaliation . Phoenix begins to destroy Alcatraz and anyone within range of her powers . Wolverine realizes that only he can stop Phoenix due to his healing factor . Wolverine approaches her and Jean momentarily gains control and begs him to kill her . Wolverine fatally stabs Jean ( and thus Phoenix ) but mourns for her death . 
 Sometime later , mutant rights are finally obtained and Xavier 's school is still operating with Storm as headmistress . The President of the United States appoints Beast as ambassador to the United Nations . Rogue reveals to Bobby Drake that she has taken the cure , much to his disappointment . Meanwhile , Magneto sits alone at a chessboard in a San Francisco park . As he gestures toward a metal chess piece , it wobbles slightly , suggesting that the effects of the cure might only be temporary . 
 In a post @-@ credits scene , Dr. Moira MacTaggert checks on a comatose patient who greets her with Xavier 's voice , leaving her startled . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Hugh Jackman as Logan / Wolverine 
 A Canadian mutant born with hyper @-@ acute , animal @-@ like senses , claws on his hands , and an accelerated healing factor that made possible to implant a coating of the indestructible metal alloy adamantium on his skeleton . Jackman was pleased to see that the script allowed Wolverine to expand his character choices , as instead of questioning whether he would remain a loner or join the X @-@ Men , Logan now is asked if he will play a leadership role in the X @-@ Men . 
 Halle Berry as Ororo Munroe / Storm 
 A mutant , who is one of Xavier 's earlier students and the leader of the X @-@ Men in Cyclops ' absence . Storm is a woman with the ability to manipulate the weather . Berry had stated during interviews for X2 that she would not return unless the character had a significant presence comparable to the comic book version , leading to a larger role in The Last Stand 's script . Berry declared that her ethnicity made the actress identify with the cure plot : " When I was a child , I felt that if only I could change myself , my life would be better . As I 've gotten older , I 've come to terms with what utter nonsense that is . " The character was given a more modern haircut , and costume designer <unk> Makovsky opted to give Storm more black clothes , a color she only wore in the leather costume for previous films , to make her " tougher and sexier " . 
 Ian McKellen as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto 
 Leader and founder of the Brotherhood , Magneto is a mutant Holocaust survivor who wages war against humanity in the name of mutant superiority . He has the ability to control and manipulate metal , making him one of the most powerful mutants . Well @-@ known for his homosexuality , McKellen found a parallel of the cure with many prejudices : " It 's abhorrent to me , as it would be if a person said I need curing of my sexuality , or if someone said that black people could take a pill that would ' cure ' them of being black . " McKellen 's shooting schedule had to accommodate his work in both The Da Vinci Code and the London theatre , going as far as filming the actor in England to later superimpose into the Vancouver plates . 
 Famke Janssen as Jean Grey / Phoenix 
 A mutant former member of the X @-@ Men , a Class 5 mutant who possesses potentially limitless telepathic and telekinetic powers . The X @-@ Men learn that she has survived the flooding dam from the previous film , but when the rest of the team finds her , Grey has given in completely to her aggressive alternate personality of her powers , the Phoenix . Her mutant powers rival those of Xavier . The writers described the multiple personalities was " an Oedipal drama played out " , where the Phoenix was " someone embodying [ a ] Greek goddess " , while Jean Grey kept the character as " a human , grounded in Freudian terms , a victim , a schizophrenic . To mark the change of Jean Grey into Phoenix , her wardrobe focused on red colors , and everyday fabric in contrast to the leather costumes of the X @-@ Men . Digital make @-@ up also made Jean 's face darker with her skin showing some veins and her eyes turning black , signifying the Phoenix personality of her <unk> Ramm as young Jean Grey 
 Anna Paquin as Marie / Rogue 
 A young mutant woman whose power causes her to temporarily take on the powers of anyone she touches , leaving her victims ( mutant or human ) unconscious , Rogue 's lack of control over her power causes a great deal of strain on her relationship with Iceman . Paquin declared that while Rogue did not have " a large physical component in this movie " , the " adult decisions " the character was forced to do made for more intensity on the emotional side . 
 Kelsey Grammer as Dr. Henry " Hank " McCoy / Beast 
 A mutant former student of Xavier 's Institute for Gifted Mutants who is now a member of the U.S. Cabinet as the Secretary of Mutant Affairs , Beast is a brilliant scientist and statesman . He is covered in blue fur and has heightened strength , reflexes and agility , as well as pointed fangs and a lion @-@ like roar . Grammer 's make @-@ up took three hours to apply , it involved applying latex prosthetics before painting his eye area and lips blue , applying various hair pieces and wigs , and a muscle suit covered with a hand @-@ punched fur suit . 
 James Marsden as Scott Summers / Cyclops 
 A mutant , who is X @-@ Men 's field leader , Cyclops emits powerful energy blasts from his eyes , and must wear specially made glasses to prevent the destruction of anything he looks at . Although he is in a committed relationship with Jean Grey , her Phoenix persona kills him early in the film . Marsden saw no problem in having a smaller role , as the films opted to feature Wolverine as the standpoint character , and feeling that " it 's difficult when you have however many new characters that you 're trying to introduce to an audience in 90 to 120 minutes , to give everyone their due . " 
 Rebecca Romijn as Raven Darkhölme / Mystique 
 Magneto 's mutant blue @-@ skinned right @-@ hand woman possesses the ability to shape @-@ shift to mimic anyone 's appearance , as well as fight with incredible agility , reflexes and strength . She jumps in front of cure darts intended for Magneto and , after she loses her mutant abilities as a result , Magneto abandons her . Romijn described this story as " a traumatic experience " for Mystique , given that the previous movies implied that she and Magneto had " a deep @-@ seated bond " , and becoming " a frail mortal would be her worst nightmare " . 
 Shawn Ashmore as Bobby Drake / Iceman 
 A young mutant , Iceman can create constructs of ice or blasts of cold . Ashmore 's commitments to X @-@ Men made him decline Bryan Singer 's invitation to play Jimmy Olsen in Superman Returns . The actor was content with his bigger role after Bobby joined the X @-@ Men main team in X2 , as during the predecessor 's production he wondered " When do I get to freeze something or get into a fight ? " 
 Aaron Stanford as John <unk> / Pyro 
 A mutant who was a former student of Xavier 's School for Gifted Mutants with a grudge against his former friend Bobby Drake , Pyro has the ability to manipulate fire , generated through wrist @-@ mounted lighters . Stanford stated that with the Brotherhood , Pyro " is allowed to fully explore his power " for lacking moral restraints . The actor was comfortable with returning to the role , particularly for following The Hills Have Eyes , which had an exhausting shoot in the Moroccan desert , while Pyro was nowhere as physically demanding - " My character 's pretty much stand @-@ and @-@ deliver , stand there and throw fire at people . There 's no acrobatics . " 
 Vinnie Jones as Cain Marko / Juggernaut 
 A mutant criminal recruited by the Brotherhood in a prison truck , Juggernaut is incredibly strong , fast and , once he gains momentum , he is nearly unstoppable . The film 's version of Juggernaut is depicted as a mutant and his relation to Charles Xavier was never mentioned . Matthew Vaughn cast Jones , who he met producing the Guy Ritchie gangster movies where Jones begun his acting career . The actor had to go through a four @-@ hour make @-@ up process to portray Juggernaut , which included a muscle suit and a prostethic chin . The costume tried to retain the bullet @-@ shaped helmet of the comics without going excessively over the top . 
 Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier / Professor X 
 A mutant with uncharted telepathic powers , and founder of Xavier 's Institute for Gifted Mutants . Xavier is an authority on genetic mutation and an advocate of peaceful relations between human and mutant kind . Stewart signed to the film without knowing Xavier would die , and not meeting original director Matthew Vaughn - both would meet in Manchester , where Stewart was filming Eleventh Hour , but eventually Brett Ratner called to introduce himself as the new director . 
 Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde / <unk> 
 A mutant with the ability to phase through matter and walk through solid objects , her clear affection for Iceman further adds to the tension already present between Iceman and Rogue . Maggie Grace was considered for the role , before Ratner invited Page , who impressed the director with her performance in Hard Candy . The actress initially declined , not wanting to yet jump to Hollywood filmmaking , but accepted after reading the script . Page said part of her motivation was having a new experience : " I thought , well , when else am I going to have a chance to wear a leather suit and run through exploding things ? Why not be a superhero for a change ? " 
 Ben Foster as Warren Worthington III / Angel 
 The mutant son of an industrialist , who has feathered wings which allow him to fly . The static wings were models with a 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) wingspan and 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) height glued to Foster 's back , replaced with computer @-@ generated ones when movement was <unk> Boyd as young Warren Worthington III 
 Dania Ramirez as Callisto 
 The leader of The Omegas , Callisto is a mutant with enhanced superhumanly acute senses , who senses mutants and their powers , and possesses superhuman speed and reflexes . The character combined the powers of the comics ' Callisto with another of the Morlocks , Caliban , and was written as someone who could be " beautiful , but with a tough persona " . Ramirez had originally auditioned to play the mutant prostitute Stacy X , and impressed Brett Ratner so much the director decided to bring her to play Callisto . 
 Michael Murphy as Warren Worthington II 
 The head of Worthington Labs , the corporation developing the " cure " , Worthington expects to rid his son of his mutant abilities . The addition of the character allowed to integrate Angel into the cure plot , which also added a parallel between Warren 's discovery of his son 's mutation with a father finding out about his son 's homosexuality . 
 <unk> Aghdashloo as Dr. Kavita Rao 
 A scientist who works at Worthington Labs on the mutant cure , she is killed by Kid Omega . Aghdashloo signed without a completed script , and erroneously said her character would be mutant doctor Cecilia Reyes . 
 Josef Sommer as the President of the United States 
 The President of the United States is tolerant of mutants , but fearful of the Brotherhood 's threats . While creating the role , the producers felt that a " different " president , like an African American or a woman , had become a cliché in itself and went for a traditional route with an elder caucasian man . Sommer was invited by Ratner following their collaboration in The Family Man . 
 Bill Duke as Secretary Trask 
 The head of the Department of Homeland Security , Secretary Trask aids the president of the United States during the war against the mutants . His first name was never mentioned in the film and is portrayed as African American . In the comics , Bolivar Trask is the head of Trask Industries and creator of the mutant @-@ hunting Sentinels . The comics version of Bolivar Trask is later played by Peter Dinklage in X @-@ Men : Days of Future Past . 
 Daniel Cudmore as Piotr " Peter " Rasputin / Colossus 
 A mutant with the ability to transform his body into an organic steel , while also granting him superhuman strength and a resistance to physical damage while in that form . Cudmore wore a foam latex muscle suit covered with a chrome @-@ plated plastic plus a hard plastic head to have the metal skin on the set , with some digital augmentation being used to enhance the facial expressions . A digital double was used only for stunts that could not be achieved practically , such as the <unk> Special where Colossus throws Wolverine . 
 Eric Dane as James Madrox / Multiple Man 
 A mutant and thief recruited by the Brotherhood in a prison truck , Madrox has the ability to create a very large number of copies of himself . The writers considered Dane 's performance memorable despite being featured in only two scenes . Madrox 's wardrobe invoked the symbols worn in his comics costume . 
 Other actors who portrayed mutants were : <unk> Melançon as Psylocke , a mutant with the ability to teleport herself through areas of shadow ; <unk> Mota as Arclight , a mutant who has the ability to generate shock waves of concussive force ; Ken Leung as Kid Omega , a mutant with the ability to eject spikes from his body , most notably his face ( though the character resembles the comic books ' character Quill however , the official cast credits read " Kid Omega " ) ; and Cameron Bright as Jimmy / Leech , a mutant who has the ability to neutralize the powers of nearby mutants . Various characters were included at the suggestion of editor Mark Helfrich , who brought Marvel 's X @-@ Men Encyclopedia to director Brett Ratner , searching for mutants who could make appearance . Mark Helfrich portrays an unnamed mutant with ash @-@ gray skin . These include Phat , a mutant that is a very large man who can slim down to fit in a smaller space ( played by two actors , Via <unk> - " large mode " - and Richard Yee - " small mode " ) ; Spike ( played by Lance Gibson ) , a mutant who battles Wolverine in the forest by extruding bony spikes from his flesh - the character was added because the editing team felt that the original cut of the scene portrayed Logan as a cold @-@ blooded killer , which could be changed if another mutant attacked Wolverine before he struck the Brotherhood and Glob Herman ( played by Clayton Dean <unk> ) , a mutant with transparent skin . Various other mutants make cameos at the X @-@ Mansion ; Shauna Kain and Kea Wong reprised their cameo roles as <unk> and Jubilee respectively , and three identical girls in the background in one scene are a reference to the Stepford Cuckoos . Olivia Williams portrays Moira MacTaggert . X @-@ Men co @-@ creator Stan Lee and writer Chris Claremont have cameos in the film 's opening scene as the neighbors of young Jean Grey . The sergeant directing defensive preparations before the Brotherhood assaults Alcatraz Island is played by R. Lee Ermey . Lloyd Adams portrays the green @-@ skinned mutant that climbs the guard tower on Alcatraz . Many fans believed this was Toad however , the credits list him as lizard man and Brett Ratner confirmed it was Anole . Avalanche and <unk> also appear however it is not known who portrayed them .

 Bryan Singer , the director of the first two X @-@ Men films , left the project in July 2004 in favor of developing Superman Returns . Singer stated that he " didn 't fully have X @-@ Men 3 in my mind " in contrast to a fully formed idea for a Superman film and interest in joining that franchise . By the time of his departure , Singer had only produced a partial story treatment with X2 screenwriters Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty , who accompanied him to Superman Returns . The treatment focused on Jean Grey 's resurrection , which would also introduce the <unk> Emma Frost , a role intended for Sigourney Weaver . Frost was an empath manipulating Jean 's emotions in the treatment and , like the finished film , Magneto desires to control her . Overwhelmed by her powers , Jean kills herself , but Jean 's spirit survives and becomes a god @-@ like creature , which Dougherty compared to the star child in A Space Odyssey . 
 New contracts for returning cast members were made , as the actors and actresses had signed for only two films . Hugh Jackman 's contract included the approval of director , initially offering the position to Darren Aronofsky , with whom he had just finished filming on The Fountain . Joss Whedon , whose comic book " Gifted " was integrated into the script 's plot , turned down the offer because he was working on a Wonder Woman film . Rob Bowman and Alex Proyas were also rumored to be up for consideration , though Proyas personally turned it down , citing feuds with 20th Century Fox president Thomas Rothman while producing I , Robot . Zack Snyder was also approached , but he was already committed to 300 . In February 2005 , with still no director hired , Fox announced a May 5 , 2006 , release date , with filming to start in July 2005 in Vancouver . One month later , the studio signed Matthew Vaughn to direct , and pushed the release date three weeks to May 26 , Memorial Day weekend . Vaughn cast Kelsey Grammer as Beast , Dania Ramirez as Callisto , and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut , but family issues led him to withdraw before filming began . Vaughn was also cautious of the tight deadlines imposed by Fox , stating that he " didn 't have the time to make the movie that I wanted to make " . John Moore was also considered to direct the film at one point . 
 Brett Ratner , who was previously considered to direct X @-@ Men in 1996 , replaced Vaughn during pre @-@ production . Ratner said he was surprised to get an invitation , as he thought he would have no chances on doing a comic book film after the cancelled Superman : Flyby . With a limited knowledge of the X @-@ Men mythos , Ratner trusted his writers on doing something faithful to the comics , having the script drawing all of its scenes from the original Marvel publications . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Simon Kinberg , who had worked in other two Marvel adaptations for Fox , Fantastic Four and Elektra , was hired as writer for X @-@ Men 3 in August 2004 . X2 co @-@ writer Zak Penn was separately working on his own draft , and the two joined forces for a combined screenplay in January 2005 . Kinberg wanted " The Dark Phoenix Saga " to be the emotional plot of the film , while " Gifted " would serve as the political focus . The duo had seven months to complete The Last Stand 's script , and during the first week of work completed the first eighty pages , consisting of the first two @-@ thirds of the plot . This incomplete draft was leaked to Ain 't It Cool News , who proceeded to write a negative review . 
 The writers had to fight Fox 's executives to retain the Phoenix plot , as the studio only wanted the cure story as it provided a reason for Magneto 's conflict with the X @-@ Men . Still the disputes made them not add much for Jean Grey to do in most of the film 's second half , as the executives considered the tone of the Phoenix story too dark for a mainstream summer movie , and that its appeal would be limited to hardcore fans rather than a general audience . Penn defended the divergences from the original Dark Phoenix stories , stating that the Phoenix was not a firebird @-@ shaped cosmic force " because it doesn 't fit into the world , " and that Cyclops did not have as much screentime as Wolverine because the latter was more popular and " with Cyclops , you can 't see his eyes . It 's a harder character to relate to for the audience . " Killing Cyclops was Fox 's decision , based on the availability of actor James Marsden , who was cast in Singer 's Superman Returns . The studio considered killing him off @-@ screen with a dialogue reference , but Kinberg and Penn insisted that Jean kill him , emphasizing their relationship . Xavier 's death was intended to match the impact of Spock 's demise in Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , as Fox felt the script called for a dramatic turning point . Kinberg and Penn were originally cautious , but grew to like the idea of killing off Xavier . They decided to write a post @-@ credits scene suggesting the character 's return for a sequel . 
 As the studio was simultaneously developing X @-@ Men Origins : Wolverine , limitations were set on which mutants could be used for cameo appearances in X @-@ Men 3 in an attempt to avoid risking character development for Wolverine . Gambit was considered for both the convoy scene being freed by Magneto and the Battle of Alcatraz along with the X @-@ Men , but the writers did not want to introduce a fan favorite character and " not be able to do him justice . " Kinberg reasoned , " there just wasn 't enough space " , and considered Gambit would only work with as much screentime as Beast . Alan Cumming had been uncomfortable with the long hours he had to take with the prosthetic makeup as Nightcrawler in X2 , but still planned to return for the sequel . The part of Nightcrawler was so minimal , however , that the studio felt it was not worthwhile to go through the long and costly makeup process , and the character was cut . Kinberg felt that " there wasn 't much left to do with the character . It also felt like he might tread a little bit on the terrain of Beast , in terms of similarities in the characters and their political standpoints in terms of dealing with their <unk> . " Nightcrawler 's absence was later explained in the tie @-@ in video game . The <unk> scenes tried to emulate the Auschwitz opener for the first film , going with different scenes that resonated later in the plot instead of an action scene like in most blockbusters . Afterwards came a scene in the Danger Room , which was considered for the previous X @-@ Men films but never included for budget and writing concerns . The writers tried to make the simulation not feel extraneous by showcasing some of the character conflicts and abilities in a " Days of Future Past " -inspired battle with a Sentinel . Another repurposed scene was Magneto attacking the convoy to free Mystique , Madrox and Juggernaut , which Penn had previously envisioned for X2 . 
 Ratner collaborated with Penn and Kinberg in rearranging the plot structure of the film . Originally , the Golden Gate Bridge sequence was in the middle of the film , where the moved bridge was used by Magneto to free mutants being held prisoners on Alcatraz , and the climax was set in Washington , D.C .. Ratner felt too many recent action films , such as Planet of the Apes and X2 itself , had their ending in Washington , and the Golden Gate sequence " would be the biggest sequence in my entire career " , and suggested to instead put the Worthington laboratory in Alcatraz , along with " creating a face for the cure " , which became the character of Jimmy / Leech . Kinberg agreed , as he previously argued with Penn about " blowing so many things early in the movie " .

 X @-@ Men : The Last Stand began shooting in August 2005 and wrapped in January 2006 . Much of the film was shot at Vancouver Film Studios , the same location of X2 . Locations included the Hatley Park National Historic Site and Royal Roads University , which doubled for the X @-@ Mansion . An old lumber mill next to the Fraser River doubled as Alcatraz Island . The tight schedule made Ratner " begin post @-@ production the day I started shooting , " sending the scenes he had just filmed to his editors . The editing team was led by Mark Helfrich , who had edited all of Ratner 's films , assisted by Mark Goldblatt in the action scenes and Julia Wong with effects @-@ heavy footage . 
 According to associate producer Dave Gordon , " This is the biggest production ever filmed in Canada . It used to be X2 , now it 's X3 . " The $ 210 million budget also made The Last Stand the most expensive film to be made at the time . The film 's record would be first broken by Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man 's Chest 's $ 225 million budget . The original cinematographer was Philippe <unk> , who eventually opted to depart production . Dante Spinotti , a frequent collaborator of Ratner , replaced him , with assistance of J. Michael Muro . Fox Filmed Entertainment co @-@ chairmen Thomas Rothman and Jim Gianopulos debated whether Rogue should give Iceman a passionate kiss at the film 's end or simply hold his hand . The two executives screened The Last Stand for their daughters , as well as the studio 's female marketing executives , and the hand holding prevailed . Gianopulos stated that the kissing " was all about sex , and we didn 't want that . " A strong campaign of secrecy about the script was enforced by Ratner and the writers . Even the actors had problems with getting full screenplays , the call sheets did not reveal all the characters , and many scenes were shot in varied ways . Both of the ending scenes were not included on the shooting script , with Ratner taking a small crew during one day 's lunch time to film the post @-@ credits scene with Xavier , and later going to London to film Magneto in the park . 
 In 2014 , Kinberg said of the wobbling chess piece at the end of the film , " There is a scene before the credits where Magneto 's playing chess , and you see that he can just make the chess piece move , so there 's a hint that he 's starting to regain his powers . The leap from there was that cure from The Last Stand didn 't work exactly the way they thought it would , and so we just leaped forward however many years , and he 's got his powers back . "

 To make sure the visual effects were made in just one year and without exceeding the budget , special effects supervisor John Bruno shipped the 900 effects shots to eleven companies in four countries - United States , New Zealand , United Kingdom and Canada - and did extensive previsualization . Their work begun in April 2005 , before the director Brett Ratner had even been announced , and Bruno made sure to emphasize practical effects , " shoot as many practical elements as possible , and only use CG when we had to . " For instance , complex wirework rigs were employed which enabled the actors to do some stunts without resorting to digital doubles , including a computer controlled flying rig from Cirque Du Soleil for Angel 's flight , and one for Halle Berry 's flying spins . 
 Bruno estimates one @-@ sixth of the effects budget was spent on the Golden Gate Bridge scene , which employed both a miniature of the bridge and computer graphics . The effects team had to work without reference footage due to the city of San Francisco vetting any filming in the actual bridge , including aerial shooting as the area has restrictions on flying helicopters . Framestore had further challenges in matching the varied weather conditions across the film 's plates . As compositing supervisor Matt Twyford detailed , " the elements consisted of cold , rainy night live @-@ action footage from Vancouver , sunny day miniature elements , traditional misty day background plates of San Francisco , and of course the CG bridge and fx elements . " Another miniature was for the Grey home , which had a <unk> equivalent matched the Canadian location and also had a digital equivalent . A notable effect was the " digital skin @-@ grafting " , which rejuvenated the faces of senior actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen , made by the Brothers Strause 's Lola Visual Effects . Bruno made sure to ask the atomization made by Phoenix was not too vivid and gruesome , instead resembling oatmeal . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Ratner , a fan of John Powell 's work in The Bourne Identity , invited Powell to write the music for The Last Stand . Powell was unsure if the Bourne work was " the kind of score that would fit the film " and Fox got reluctant on the composer 's availability given he was already scoring Ice Age 2 : The Meltdown at the time of Ratner 's contact . But Powell finished the Ice Age score early to accept the X @-@ Men job even if it meant a tighter schedule . Powell included references to the score from the previous two films as " it all had to be in the same family , and the same language " . The Phoenix theme used lyrics from Benjamin Britten 's Requiem Mass for the choir parts . A soundtrack album was released on May 23 , 2006 . 
 = = Marketing = = 
 The marketing for The Last Stand was darker and more ambiguous compared to the two predecessors . Fox president Tom Rothman declared that the decision was made so the film would " be different from all of the other movies in the summer , " with a campaign that " wanted people to stop and not have it be so immediately apparent that we 're selling a movie . We 're interested in selling an emotion and an idea . " The film 's official website was launched in October 2005 . The teaser trailer release with King Kong the following December was done in conjunction with the studio releasing the film 's first official screen shots of the film to USA Today . Diamond Select Toys created a toy line , scanning the actors from the film with likenesses for the first time in the trilogy . Additional product tie @-@ ins came with Harley @-@ Davidson and 7 @-@ Eleven . A seven @-@ minute sneak peek aired on Fox Broadcasting two weeks before the film 's theatrical release . 
 Del Rey Books published a novelization of the film , written by comic book writer Chris Claremont , while Newmarket Press published The Art of X @-@ Men : The Last Stand : From Concept to Feature Film . Claremont also worked on Activision 's tie @-@ in video game , X @-@ Men : The Official Game , doing the script along with screenwriter Zak Penn . The game 's story bridges the events between X2 and The Last Stand , featuring Wolverine , Iceman and Nightcrawler as playable characters , voiced by their film portrayers Hugh Jackman , Shawn Ashmore , and Alan Cumming . Patrick Stewart also appears as Professor X. The game was released to negative reviews and eventually underperformed commercially .

 X @-@ Men : The Last Stand received mixed reviews from critics . At Rotten Tomatoes , the film has a score of 58 % , based on 232 reviews , with an average rating of 5 @.@ 9 / 10 .

" At Metacritic , it has a score of 58 out of 100 , based on 38 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . 
 Ebert and Roeper gave the film a " two thumbs up " rating , with Roger Ebert saying , " I liked the action , I liked the absurdity , I liked the incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers , and I especially liked the way it introduces all of those political issues and lets them fight it out with the special effects . " Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com gave it a mixed review , noting that it was " only half a mess " , and that Ratner " could have stuck a bit more closely to the ' Dark Phoenix ' narrative than he did . " However , Zacharek did note that that third act captured some of the original story 's " majesty " . Famke Janssen 's performance was praised by critics and audiences . Also impressed with Janssen 's performance was Total Film , who said , " Playing the super @-@ freaky mind @-@ control goddess like GoldenEye 's Xenia Onatopp 's all @-@ powerful psycho sister , her scenes – particularly that one with the house – crackle with energy and tragedy . If only the rest of X3 had followed suit . " 
 Justin Chang of Variety said the film was " a wham @-@ bam sequel noticeably lacking in the pop gravitas , moody atmospherics , and emotional weight that made the first two Marvel <unk> adaptations so rousingly successful . " Frank Lovece of Film Journal International said , " A risk @-@ taking script with genuine consequences elevates this above the lackluster direction of Brett Ratner , whose competent mechanics move the story efficiently but with very little soul . " Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it a " " diminished sequel , a brute @-@ force enterprise " and said it was an example of " what happens when movies are confused with sandwich shops as franchise opportunities " . The Minneapolis Star Tribune characterized Ratner 's approach as " Forget subtlety ! Let 's blow things up ! " David Edelstein of New York magazine called it " just another big @-@ budget B @-@ movie . It 's a fast and enjoyable B @-@ movie , though . " Foreshadowing X @-@ Men : First Class , Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said , " Last stand ? My ass . Billed as the climax of a trilogy , the third and weakest chapter in the X @-@ Men series is a blatant attempt to prove there is still life in the franchise . And there is : just enough to pull a Star Trek and spawn a Next Generation saga . " 
 Writer Kinberg would later state that " there are a lot of things about ' X3 ' that I love and there are a lot of things that I regret " , detailing that he would have preferred the Dark Phoenix as the main plotline and " I would have fought harder " for that , considering that at the period " the darkness of her story was a little bit daunting on a huge $ 200 million studio movie " leading Fox to ask for rewrites . Previous X @-@ Men director Bryan Singer declared that The Last Stand " isn 't what I would have done " and he was dissatisfied with the busy plot and excessive character deaths , but Singer still liked some parts of the movie , such as Ellen Page 's casting - leading Singer to bring her back as Kitty Pryde in X @-@ Men : Days of Future Past - and the scenes with Leech , which he described as " really sweet moments " . Matthew Vaughn , who was attached as director before dropping out , criticized Ratner 's direction : " I could have done something with far more emotion and heart . I 'm probably going to be told off for saying that , but I genuinely believe it . " While promoting his own installment of the franchise , 2011 's X @-@ Men : First Class , Vaughn would say regarding The Last Stand that " I storyboarded the whole bloody film , did the script . My X3 would have been 40 minutes longer . They didn 't let the emotions and the drama play in that film . It became wall @-@ to @-@ wall noise and drama .

 However , the next two X @-@ Men films , X @-@ Men Origins : Wolverine ( 2009 ) and X @-@ Men : First Class ( 2011 ) were instead prequels that took place before the events of the first X @-@ Men movie .

 = HMS Ark Royal ( 91 ) = 
 HMS Ark Royal ( pennant number 91 ) was an aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy that served during the Second World War . 
 Designed in 1934 to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty , Ark Royal was built by Cammell Laird and Company Ltd. at Birkenhead , England , and completed in November 1938 . Her design differed from previous aircraft carriers . Ark Royal was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull , instead of an add @-@ on or part of the superstructure . Designed to carry a large number of aircraft , she had two hangar deck levels . She served during a period that first saw the extensive use of naval air power ; a number of carrier tactics were developed and refined aboard Ark Royal . 
 Ark Royal served in some of the most active naval theatres of the Second World War . She was involved in the first aerial and U @-@ boat kills of the war , operations off Norway , the search for the German battleship Bismarck , and the Malta Convoys . Ark Royal survived several near misses and gained a reputation as a ' lucky ship ' . The Germans incorrectly reported her as sunk on multiple occasions . 
 She was torpedoed on 13 November 1941 by the German submarine U @-@ 81 and sank the following day . Her sinking was the subject of several inquiries ; investigators were keen to know how the carrier was lost , in spite of efforts to save the ship and tow her to the naval base at Gibraltar . They found that several design flaws contributed to the loss , which were rectified in new British carriers . 
 Her wreck was discovered by a BBC crew in December 2002 , approximately 30 nautical miles ( 35 mi ; 56 km ) from Gibraltar . 
 = = Design = = 
 In 1923 , the Admiralty prepared a 10 @-@ year building programme which included an aircraft carrier and 300 aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm . The economic downturn following the First World War caused it to be postponed . In 1930 , the Director of Naval Construction , Sir Arthur Johns , began to update the plans for the carrier by incorporating recently developed technology . His aim was to increase the number of aircraft carried by shortening the landing and take @-@ off distances of aircraft by using arrestor gear and compressed steam catapults respectively , which would make more deck space available for storage and aircraft preparation . Along with the inclusion of two hangar decks , this allowed Ark Royal to carry up to 72 aircraft , although the development of larger and heavier aircraft during the carrier 's construction meant that the actual number carried was between 50 and 60 . The hangar decks were placed inside the hull , thus benefiting from the protection of the 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 11 @.@ 4 cm ) belt armour . Three lifts moved aircraft between the hangars and the flight deck . 
 Another feature was the length and height of the flight deck . At 800 feet ( 240 m ) , the flight deck was 118 feet ( 36 m ) longer than the keel ; the latter dictated by the length of Royal Navy dry @-@ docks in Gibraltar and Malta . Because hangar decks were within the hull , the flight deck rose to 66 feet ( 20 m ) above the waterline . 
 The Washington and London Naval Treaties — which restricted warship tonnage for a number of the Great Powers — were to expire at the end of 1936 . With a potential naval arms race developing between Britain , Japan and Italy , the British government sought a second treaty , which included limiting the maximum displacement of an aircraft carrier to 22 @,@ 000 long tons ( 22 @,@ 000 t ) . Ark Royal would have to fit this anticipated limit ; to conserve weight , armour plating was limited to the belt , engine rooms , and magazines , while welding instead of riveting 65 % of the hull saved 500 long tons ( 510 t ) . Installation of an armoured flight deck was not possible , as the weight would have placed Ark Royal above the proposed limit , while reducing her endurance and stability . The ship was designed with a three layer side protection system based upon a void @-@ liquid @-@ void scheme very similar to that used on the King George V @-@ class battleships , and was designed to protect against torpedoes with up to a 750 @-@ pound ( 340 kg ) warhead . 
 The ship was fitted with six boilers , which powered three Parsons geared turbines . The turbines were connected via three <unk> to three bronze propellers 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) in diameter , to produce a maximum theoretical speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) . Speed was important , as with catapults and arrestor gear , Ark Royal would have to turn into the wind to launch and recover aircraft . To avoid endangering other ships with the frequent course changes associated with flight operations , Ark Royal would have to break away from accompanying ships , and catch up on completion . Additionally , as the carrier was not armed for ship @-@ to @-@ ship combat , speed was her main protection against enemy warships . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The deteriorating international situation by 1933 , typified by Germany 's rearmament and the expansion of Japan and Italy , convinced the British to announce funds for the carrier 's construction in the 1934 budget proposals . The plans were finished by November 1934 and were tendered in February 1935 to Cammell Laird and Company Ltd . , which calculated the cost of the hull at £ 1 @,@ 496 @,@ 250 ( equivalent to £ 93 @,@ 670 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) and the main machinery at approximately £ 500 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to £ 31 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) . The overall cost was estimated to be over £ 3 million , making Ark Royal the most expensive ship ordered by the Royal Navy . Construction began on Job No. 1012 when Ark Royal 's keel was laid down on 16 September 1935 . 
 Ark Royal spent nearly two years in the builder 's yard before being launched on 13 April 1937 by Lady Maud Hoare , wife of Sir Samuel Hoare , then First Lord of the Admiralty . The bottle of champagne thrown against Ark Royal 's bows did not smash until the fourth attempt . The carrier spent a year fitting out , was handed over to her first commander , Captain Arthur Power , on 16 November 1938 , and was commissioned on 16 December . Although intended for the Far East , events in Europe during the carrier 's construction , including the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 and the Spanish Civil War in 1936 , caused the Admiralty to mark her for deployment with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets . After her crew joined at the end of 1938 , Ark Royal underwent sea trials to prepare for service , during which the carrier proved capable of sailing above her theoretical speed , reaching over 31 knots ( 57 km / h ; 36 mph ) and in trials during May 1938 Ark Royal achieved 31 @.@ 2 knots ( 57 @.@ 8 km / h ; 35 @.@ 9 mph ) with 103 @,@ 012 shaft horsepower ( 76 @,@ 816 kW ) at a deep displacement of 27 @,@ 525 long tons ( 27 @,@ 967 t ) . 
 = = Armament and aircraft = = 
 Ark Royal 's armament was designed with anti @-@ aircraft warfare in mind , as aircraft were expected to be the main threat ; ships and submarines could be outrun or dealt with by escorts . Her main armament was sixteen quick @-@ firing 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 110 mm ) dual purpose guns in eight double turrets , four on each side of the hull , controlled by four Directors using the High Angle Control System . The original design placed the turrets low on the hull , but was later altered to locate them just below the flight deck , which increased each turret 's field of fire . Six 8 @-@ barrelled 2 @-@ pounder ( 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 57 in ) ) " pom @-@ pom " guns were located on the flight deck , in front of and behind the superstructure island , while eight 4 @-@ barrelled .50 @-@ inch ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) machine guns were installed on small projecting platforms to the front and rear of the flight deck . 
 Sixteen Fleet Air Arm squadrons were posted aboard Ark Royal during her career ; an average of five squadrons at any time . On entering service , most of Ark Royal 's squadrons were equipped with either Blackburn Skuas — used as fighters and dive bombers — or Fairey Swordfish , for reconnaissance and torpedo bombing . From April 1940 , squadrons equipped with Skuas were upgraded to Fairey Fulmars ; like their predecessors , these were used as fighters and bombers . On occasion , the carrier operated Blackburn Roc fighter @-@ bombers ( from April 1939 – October 1940 ) and Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers ( during October 1941 ) ; these were replacement aircraft used to boost squadron numbers . In June 1940 , Ark Royal was host to 701 Naval Air Squadron , a training squadron which operated Supermarine Walrus reconnaissance amphibians .

 = = = With the hunter @-@ killer groups = = = 
 The outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939 had been presaged by Germany 's U @-@ boat fleet taking up positions off the British coast , where they could intercept British shipping . Within hours of the war starting , the passenger ship SS Athenia was torpedoed by U @-@ 30 , the first of over 65 @,@ 000 long tons ( 66 @,@ 000 t ) of shipping sunk by U @-@ boats during the first week of the war . Ark Royal was deployed with the Home Fleet in the North Western Approaches as part of a " hunter @-@ killer " group , consisting of a flotilla of destroyers and other anti @-@ submarine vessels grouped around an aircraft carrier ; either Courageous , Hermes or Ark Royal . Carrier @-@ borne aircraft could increase the area searched for U @-@ boats , but made the carriers tempting targets . 
 On 14 September , Ark Royal received a distress call from SS Fanad Head , which was 200 nautical miles ( 230 mi ; 370 km ) away under pursuit from the surfaced U @-@ 30 . Ark Royal launched aircraft to aid the merchant ship , but was spotted by U @-@ 39 , which launched two torpedoes . Lookouts spotted the torpedo tracks and Ark Royal turned towards the attack , reducing her cross @-@ section and causing the torpedoes to miss and explode harmlessly astern . Three F @-@ class destroyers escorting the carrier began to depth charge U @-@ 39 , and forced her to the surface . The German crew abandoned ship before U @-@ 39 sank — the first U @-@ boat lost during the war . Ark Royal 's aircraft reached Fanad Head , which was in the hands of a German boarding party . The Skuas unsuccessfully attacked U @-@ 30 : two crashed when caught by the blast of their own bombs . The U @-@ boat escaped after rescuing the boarding party and the pilots of the downed aircraft ( both observers had drowned ) , and torpedoing the Fanad Head . 
 Ark Royal returned to base in Loch Ewe , where she and her crew were inspected by Winston Churchill . The sinking of U @-@ 39 was hailed as important to morale . However , the failed attack on Ark Royal , and the successful attack on Courageous on 17 September , convinced the Admiralty it was too dangerous to risk aircraft carriers in this way , and carrier @-@ centred hunter @-@ killer groups were abandoned . 
 = = = Another near miss = = = 
 On 25 September , Ark Royal helped rescue the submarine Spearfish , which had been damaged by German warships off Horn Reefs , in the Kattegat . While returning to port with Spearfish and the battleships Nelson and Rodney on 26 September , the ships were located by three Luftwaffe Dornier Do 18 seaplanes . Ark Royal launched three Blackburn Skuas to disperse them ; one Dornier was shot down in the first British aerial kill of the war . 
 The air commander aboard Ark Royal — aware that the surviving Dorniers would report the location of the British ships — ordered the aircraft to be secured and the anti @-@ aircraft weapons readied . Four Junkers Ju 88 bombers of the Luftwaffe bomber wing KG 30 soon appeared : three were driven away by anti @-@ aircraft fire , but the fourth launched a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ kilogram ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) bomb at the carrier . Ark Royal turned hard to starboard , heeling over and avoiding the bomb , which landed in the ocean 30 metres ( 98 ft ) off her starboard bow and sent a spout of water over the ship . The German pilots did not see if the carrier had been hit , and a reconnaissance flight later located the two battleships , but not Ark Royal . Based on this information , the Germans incorrectly claimed that Ark Royal had sunk . To prove the German propaganda false before it had a negative effect on Britain 's allies , Winston Churchill personally reassured United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt that the carrier was undamaged and invited the US naval attaché to view Ark Royal in dock . The British naval attaché in Rome was instructed to assure Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini that the ship was still in service . This proved to be a considerable embarrassment for Goebbels and Nazi propaganda . 
 = = = Hunting the Graf Spee = = = 
 In October 1939 , Ark Royal was redeployed to Freetown to operate off the African coast in the hunt for the German commerce raider Admiral Graf Spee . The carrier was assigned to Force K , and sailed with the battlecruiser Renown to the South Atlantic . On 9 October , aircraft from Ark Royal spotted the German tanker Altmark , which supplied Graf Spee . The tanker was disguised as the US vessel Delmar , which fooled the British into passing her by . On 5 November , Ark Royal captured the German merchant SS <unk> , which was attempting to reach Germany . The ship was later taken into British service as a cargo ship and renamed Empire Ability . Several neutral merchant ships were also spotted by the carrier 's aircraft , twice causing crews to believe they were under attack and abandon ship . A note explaining the situation was dropped in a bag to a Norwegian vessel 's crew , and they re @-@ boarded ; an attempt to repeat this exercise with a Belgian crew failed when the bag was dropped down the ship 's funnel . 
 By this time , Graf Spee had put into Montevideo to repair damage received during the battle of the River Plate . Two Royal Navy cruisers followed the raider , and patrolled the harbour entrance while reporting Graf Spee 's position to the fleet . Ark Royal and Renown were dispatched to join the British ships outside the harbour , but as they were 36 hours away , the British naval attaché came up with a plan to make the Germans believe that the two capital ships had already arrived . An order for fuel for Ark Royal was placed at Buenos Aires , 140 miles ( 230 km ) west of Montevideo . This was leaked to the press , passed on to the German embassy in Montevideo , and given to Graf Spee 's captain , Hans Langsdorff . This contributed to Langsdorff 's decision to scuttle his ship . 
 = = = Return to the fleet = = = 
 With Graf Spee sunk , Ark Royal remained in the Atlantic for a short time before escorting the damaged heavy cruiser Exeter back to Devonport Dockyard , where they arrived in February . Following this , Ark Royal proceeded to Portsmouth to take on supplies and personnel , before sailing to Scapa Flow . On arrival , she transferred her Blackburn Skuas to Naval Air Station Hatston to strengthen the anchorage 's defences . Ark Royal was then assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet for exercises , departing Scapa Flow on 31 March 1940 and heading for Alexandria with the aircraft carrier Glorious . The carriers arrived in the Eastern Mediterranean on 8 April , but the exercises were cancelled a day later . The ships sailed to Gibraltar to await orders . 
 German forces had invaded Norway as part of Operation Weserübung on 9 April , and had secured sections of the coast . Attempts by the Royal Navy to operate in support of British troops were unsuccessful ; air attacks had overwhelmed the ships , sinking Gurkha and nearly sinking Suffolk . Realising that the British ships required air cover , but aware that the Norwegian coast was outside the range of British land @-@ based aircraft , the Admiralty recalled Ark Royal and Glorious from the Mediterranean on 16 April . 
 = = = Norwegian campaign = = = 
 Ark Royal and Glorious arrived at Scapa Flow on 23 April 1940 and were immediately redeployed as part of Operation DX . Sailing to Norway with the cruisers Curlew and Berwick and screened by the destroyers Hyperion , Hereward , Hasty , Fearless , Fury and Juno , this was the first time the Royal Navy had deployed carriers with the primary purpose of providing fighter protection for other warships . The ships took up position on 25 April off the coast ; Ark Royal positioned 120 nautical miles ( 220 km ) offshore to reduce the chance of air attacks . The carrier 's aircraft conducted anti @-@ submarine patrols , provided fighter support for other ships , and carried out strikes against shipping and shore targets . Ark Royal returned to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and replace lost and damaged aircraft , before heading back on the same day with the battleship Valiant as escort . During the return , Ark Royal came under air attack from German Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 bombers operating from Norway . The carrier was undamaged , and resumed position on 29 April . 
 By this point , the British high command had realised that they could not hold the Germans in southern Norway . The evacuation of Allied troops from Molde and Åndalsnes began , with Ark Royal providing air cover from 30 April . On 1 May , the Germans tried to sink the carrier , with numerous air attacks through the day . Ark Royal 's fighters and a heavy anti @-@ aircraft barrage drove off the enemy , and although several bombs were dropped at the carrier , none impacted . The evacuation was completed on 3 May , and the carrier was recalled to Scapa Flow to refuel and rearm before returning to Norway . While in port , Captain Arthur Power left the ship for a promotion to the Admiralty , and was replaced by Captain Cedric Holland . On return to Norway , Ark Royal was told to provide air cover for operations around Narvik , including the landing of French troops on 13 May . She was joined on 18 May by the carriers Glorious and Furious . 
 Despite these efforts , it was clear by the end of May that French forces were on the verge of collapse and Norway was a sideshow compared to the German advance to the English Channel . Operation Alphabet was instigated to move Allied troops from Narvik to Britain . Ark Royal and Glorious — screened by the destroyers Highlander , Diana , Acasta , Ardent , and Acheron — sailed from Scapa Flow on 1 June to cover the evacuation , which commenced the next day . Ark Royal carried out air patrols and bombing raids from 3 – 6 June , before redeploying to Narvik on 7 June . Disaster struck the next day , when Glorious , escorted by Acasta and Ardent , were detached to return to Britain . The three ships were attacked and sunk by the German battlecruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau . A search by Ark Royal 's aircraft failed to locate the German ships , which had returned to Trondheim . 
 The last evacuation convoy left Narvik on 9 June . Before the British ships could withdraw , a raid on Trondheim located Scharnhorst . An attack by Ark Royal 's Skuas took place at midnight on 13 June . The attack was a disaster : the escort destroyers Antelope and Electra collided while Ark Royal was launching aircraft in fog and returned to England for repairs , eight of the fifteen attacking Skuas were shot down , while Scharnhorst escaped damage . Ark Royal returned to Scapa Flow the following day , and was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet . 
 = = = Mediterranean deployment = = = 
 Ark Royal left Scapa Flow with the battlecruiser Hood and three destroyers , arriving at Gibraltar on 23 June 1940 . Here she joined Force H , under Sir James Somerville . After the capitulation of France there was concern that a French fleet at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir might fall under Axis control and tip the balance of power in the Mediterranean , affecting the whole war . Ark Royal 's captain , Cedric Holland , had been the British naval attaché in Paris , and was sent to negotiate the surrender or scuttling of the French fleet . Force H was deployed outside the harbour , and when the French admirals refused to agree to the offered terms , opened fire on the French ships . During the attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir , Ark Royal 's aircraft provided targeting information for the British ships . The French battleship Strasbourg escaped , despite attacks by Swordfish from Ark Royal . Two days after the attack , aircraft from Ark Royal incapacitated the French battleship Dunkerque , which had been beached in the initial attack . 
 Having reduced the possibility of a French challenge in the Mediterranean , Force H prepared for attacks on Italian targets , and sailed from Gibraltar on 8 July . The force was attacked by Italian bombers within eight hours of departing , and although Force H escaped damage , Somerville cancelled the raids and ordered the fleet to Gibraltar . During July , the British colony of Malta came under attack from the Italian air force , with Force H ordered to deliver Hawker Hurricanes to reinforce the island 's air defences . Force H was deployed from 31 July – 4 August , with the carrier Argus used to deliver the aircraft , while Ark Royal provided air cover for the fleet . On 2 August , Ark Royal launched a successful air attack against the Italian air base at Cagliari . 
 Force H remained at Gibraltar until 30 September , when it escorted reinforcements for Admiral Andrew Cunningham 's fleet to Alexandria . En route , diversionary attacks were planned on Italian air bases at Elmas and Cagliari to direct attention from both the reinforcement operation and a supply convoy sailing to Malta . The attacks were successfully carried out on 1 October , and the fleet reached Alexandria without significant attention from the Italian air force . From Alexandria , Ark Royal was detached and sent to West Africa to support British attempts to encourage Vichy French colonies to switch allegiance to the Free French . During negotiations , several Free French aircraft flew from Ark Royal , but their aircrews were arrested at Dakar . Negotiations failed , and bombers from Ark Royal were directed against military installations during the unsuccessful British attempt to take Dakar by force . Following this , Ark Royal returned to Britain for refit , docking in Liverpool on 8 October after being escorted by Fortune , Forester and Greyhound . The refit — which lasted until 3 November — included repairs to her machinery and the installation of a new flight deck barrier . 
 Following refit , Ark Royal — accompanied by Barham , Berwick , and Glasgow — sailed for Gibraltar , arriving on 6 November . They were deployed with the rest of Force H to escort convoys from Gibraltar to Alexandria and Malta , performing several runs before being assigned to Operation Collar , one of 35 convoys to support Malta between 1940 and 1942 , on 25 November . An Italian fleet — led by the battleships Giulio Cesare and Vittorio Veneto — was dispatched to intercept the convoy . The Italian fleet was detected by a reconnaissance aircraft from Ark Royal and the carrier launched Swordfish torpedo bombers while the capital ships of Force H turned to meet the enemy . During the engagement , the Battle of Cape Spartivento , the Italian destroyer <unk> was damaged , although it is uncertain if torpedoes from the bombers or British gunfire were responsible . The British mistook <unk> for a cruiser , while the Italian commanders received incorrect reports that the cruiser Bolzano had been hit . British attacks failed to damage any other Italian ships or sink the disabled destroyer , and a retaliatory attack by the Italian air force saw Ark Royal as the subject of multiple bombing runs , none of which hit . The battle had no clear result , although the British convoy reached its destination unscathed . 
 On 14 December 1940 , Ark Royal and Force H were redeployed from Gibraltar to the Atlantic to search the Azores for commerce raiders . Ark Royal returned to the Mediterranean on 20 December , and escorted the battleship Malaya and merchant ships from Malta until 27 December . Force H then became involved in Operation Excess , a plan to move convoys through the Mediterranean to support the Western Desert Force , which was trying to push Italian land forces from Egypt into Libya . Over the next month , British control of the Mediterranean theatre was weakened , particularly by the entry of the Luftwaffe and the near @-@ loss of the aircraft carrier Illustrious . The Mediterranean Fleet was under pressure from Axis forces in the Eastern Mediterranean , while the British port at Gibraltar was likely to be lost if the Spanish chose to ally with the Germans instead of remaining out of the war . To relieve the Mediterranean Fleet , while demonstrating British strength to the Spanish , the Admiralty and Admiral Cunningham planned to use Ark Royal 's Swordfish bombers in raids against Italian targets , supported by bombardment from heavy fleet units . The first bombing , on 2 January against the Tirso Dam in Sardinia , was unsuccessful , but Ark Royal 's Swordfish bombers were more successful on 6 January , when they bombed the port city of Genoa . The carrier 's aircraft also covered the battlecruiser Renown and battleship Malaya while they shelled the port . On 9 January , Ark Royal launched aircraft to bomb an oil refinery at La Spezia , and to lay mines in the harbour . Both operations were successful . 
 = = = Searching for Scharnhorst and Gneisenau = = = 
 In early February 1941 , the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau headed into the Atlantic on the orders of Grand Admiral Erich Raeder , commander of the German Navy . They were to disrupt Allied shipping and draw capital ships from other areas . On 8 March , Force H and Ark Royal were ordered to the Canary Islands to search for the battleships , and to cover convoys crossing from the United States . Ark Royal used her aircraft to search for captured ships returning to Germany under the control of prize crews . Three ships were located on 19 March : two scuttled themselves , while the third — SS Polykarp — was recaptured . 
 On the evening of 21 March 1941 a Fairey Fulmar from Ark Royal stumbled across Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at sea . Because of a radio malfunction , the crew had to return to Ark Royal to report , by which time the German ships had escaped under fog . The next day , Ark Royal re @-@ established air patrols in the hope of re @-@ locating the raiders . During the day , a catapult malfunction destroyed a Fairey Swordfish ; flinging the fuselage into the sea ahead of the carrier . Unable to stop , Ark Royal ran over the Swordfish and was overhead when the aircraft 's depth charges detonated . Scharnhorst and Gneisenau reached Brest without British harassment , while Ark Royal returned to Gibraltar for repairs , arriving on 24 March . 
 = = = Malta convoys and Operation Tiger = = = 
 Ark Royal spent April alternating between covering convoys and delivering aircraft to Malta and forays into the Atlantic to hunt commerce raiders . By May 1941 , Erwin Rommel 's Afrika Korps were driving through North Africa towards the Suez Canal , pushing the Western Desert Force before them . With British forces close to collapse and strategic locations threatened , the British High Command risked sending a reinforcement convoy across the Mediterranean to Alexandria . The convoy consisted of five large transport ships , escorted by Ark Royal , the battlecruiser Renown , the battleship Queen Elizabeth , the cruisers Sheffield , Naiad , Fiji , and Gloucester , and screened by destroyers of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla . Prior to Ark Royal 's departure , Captain Holland left to recuperate from stress and poor health , and was replaced by Captain Loben Maund . The convoy left Gibraltar on 6 May , and was detected by Italian aircraft . The convoy — limited to 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) and escorted by so many capital ships — was such a tempting target that Italian and German aircraft were mobilised . 
 The British convoy came under air attack on 8 May , first by the Italian air force , then German Luftwaffe . Over the day , 12 of Ark Royal 's Fairey Fulmars ( the maximum number available ) drove off over 50 aircraft , with the assistance of targeting information from Sheffield 's radar and anti @-@ aircraft fire from the escorts . During the initial waves , one Fulmar was lost , killing Flight Lieutenant Rupert Tillard and Lieutenant Mark Somerville , Admiral Somerville 's nephew ; another was destroyed with the aircrew recovered , while several others were damaged . Consequently , only seven were able to face the main Luftwaffe force of 34 aircraft , while an attack just before dark was driven off by two aircraft and heavy fire from the ships . The convoy survived without serious damage : the only casualties were to mines , with the Empire Song sunk and New Zealand Star damaged but able to reach port . 
 Ark Royal underwent another aerial attack on 12 May , during her return to Gibraltar . Later that month , she and fellow aircraft carrier Furious delivered Hawker Hurricanes to support Malta . 
 = = = Hunting the Bismarck = = = 
 On 18 May 1941 , the German battleship Bismarck and heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen began Operation Rheinübung by breaking into the Atlantic to raid shipping . After sinking the battlecruiser Hood and damaging the battleship Prince of Wales during the Battle of the Denmark Strait , Bismarck shook off her pursuers and headed for the French Atlantic coast . Ark Royal , Renown , and Sheffield — accompanied by Faulknor , Foresight , Forester , Fortune , Foxhound , and Fury — were dispatched to the Atlantic on 23 May to search for the battleship . On 26 May , a Swordfish from Ark Royal located Bismarck and began to shadow her , while the Home Fleet was mobilised to pursue . 
 At the time of detection , the British ships were 130 nautical miles ( 150 mi ; 240 km ) away and would not catch Bismarck before she reached Saint @-@ Nazaire . Fifteen Swordfish bombers were armed with torpedoes and sent to delay the ship . Sheffield , also shadowing Bismarck , was between Ark Royal and Bismarck . The aircraft mistook the British cruiser for their target and fired torpedoes . The torpedoes were fitted with unreliable magnetic detonators , which caused most to explode on contact with the water , while Sheffield evaded the rest . After realising his mistake , one of the pilots signalled ' Sorry for the <unk> ' to Sheffield . 
 On return to the carrier , the Swordfish were re @-@ armed with contact @-@ detonator warheads , and launched at 19 : 15 for a second attack ; locating and attacking Bismarck just before sunset . Three torpedoes hit the battleship : two impacted forward of the engine rooms , while the third struck the port steering room and jammed her rudder in a 15 ° port turn . Bismarck was forced to sail in circles until a combination of alternating propeller speeds was found which would keep her on a reasonably steady course which , in the prevailing force 8 wind and sea state , forced her to sail towards the British warships with almost no manoeuvring capability . The German battleship suffered heavy attack during the night of 26 – 27 May , and sank at 10 : 39 hours on 27 May . 
 = = = Escorting the Malta convoys = = = 
 Ark Royal and the ships of Force H returned to Gibraltar on 29 May 1941 . Despite the boost in Allied morale from the sinking of the battleship Bismarck , the war in the Mediterranean was going against the Allies . Greece and Crete had fallen to the Axis Powers , and the Afrika Korps was preparing to launch a final push into Egypt . Malta remained an important stronghold in the Mediterranean , but was coming under increased pressure from Italian and German air attacks , and could no longer be supplied from the east since the fall of Crete . 
 Ark Royal was pressed into service , delivering aircraft to Malta during several supply runs throughout June and July , and escorting the convoys of Operation Substance in July and Operation Halberd in September . Despite some losses , the convoys succeeded in keeping Malta supplied and fighting . The continued Allied presence in Malta was a considerable problem for Rommel in Africa , who was losing as much as ⅓ of his supplies from Italy to submarines and bombers based there . Adolf Hitler decided to send a flotilla of U @-@ boats into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping , against the advice of Großadmiral Raeder . 
 = = Final voyage and sinking = = 
 On 10 November 1941 , Ark Royal ferried more aircraft to Malta before returning to Gibraltar . Admiral Somerville had been warned of U @-@ boats off the Spanish coast , and reminded Force H to be vigilant . Also at sea was Friedrich <unk> 's U @-@ 81 , which had received a report that Force H was returning to Gibraltar . On 13 November , at 15 : 40 , the sonar operator aboard the destroyer Legion detected an unidentified sound , but assumed it was the propellers of a nearby destroyer . One minute later , Ark Royal was struck amidships by a torpedo , between the fuel bunkers and bomb store , and directly below the bridge island . The explosion caused Ark Royal to shake , hurled loaded torpedo @-@ bombers into the air , and killed Able Seaman Edward Mitchell . A 130 @-@ by @-@ 30 @-@ foot ( 39 @.@ 6 m × 9 @.@ 1 m ) hole was created on the starboard side and bottom by a torpedo which was judged to have run deep , striking the bilge keel , and detonating inboard of the side protection system . The hit caused flooding of the starboard boiler room , main switchboard , oil tanks , and over 106 feet ( 32 m ) of the ship 's starboard bilge . The starboard power train was knocked out , causing the rear half of the ship to lose power , while communications were severed shipwide . 
 Immediately after the torpedo strike , Captain Maund attempted to order the engines to full stop , but had to send a runner to the engine room when it was discovered communications were down . The hole in the hull was enlarged by the ship 's motion , and by the time Ark Royal stopped she had taken on water and begun to list to starboard , reaching 18 ° from centre within 20 minutes . Considering the list of the carrier , as well as the fates of other carriers , including Courageous and Glorious , which had sunk rapidly with heavy loss of life , Maund gave the order to abandon ship . The crew were assembled on the flight deck to determine who would remain on board to save the ship while Legion came alongside to take off the rest . As a result , comprehensive damage control measures were not initiated until 49 minutes after the attack . The flooding spread unchecked , exacerbated by covers and hatches left open during evacuation of lower decks . 
 Water spread to the centreline boiler room , which started to flood from below , and power was lost shipwide when the boiler uptakes became choked ; Ark Royal had no backup diesel generators . About half an hour after the explosion , the carrier appeared to stabilise . Admiral Somerville , determined to save Ark Royal , ordered damage control parties back to the carrier before taking the battleship Malaya to Gibraltar to organise salvage efforts . The damage control parties were able to re @-@ light a boiler , restoring power to the bilge pumps . The destroyer Laforey came alongside to provide power and additional pumps , while Swordfish aircraft from Gibraltar arrived to supplement anti @-@ submarine patrols . The tug Thames arrived from Gibraltar at 20 : 00 and attached a tow line to Ark Royal , but flooding caused the angle of list to increase rapidly . Water had reached the boiler room fan flat , an uninterrupted compartment running the width of the ship , which forced the shutdown of the restored boiler . 
 The list reached 20 ° between 02 : 05 and 02 : 30 , and when ' abandon ship ' was declared again at 04 : 00 , had reached 27 ° . Ark Royal 's complement had been evacuated to Legion by 04 : 30 ; with the exception of Mitchell , there were no fatalities . The 1 @,@ 487 officers and crew were transported to Gibraltar . The list reached 45 ° before Ark Royal capsized and sank at 06 : 19 on 14 November . Witnesses reported the carrier rolling to 90 ° , where she remained for three minutes before inverting . Ark Royal then broke in two , the aft sinking within a couple of minutes , followed by the bow . 
 = = = Investigation = = = 
 Following the sinking , a Board of Inquiry was established to investigate the loss . Based on its findings , Captain Loben Maund was court @-@ martialled for negligence in February 1942 . He was found guilty on two counts of negligence : one of failing to ensure that properly constituted damage control parties had remained on board after the general evacuation , and one of failing to ensure the ship was in a sufficient state of readiness to deal with possible damage . The board tempered their judgement with an acknowledgement that a high standard was being expected of Maund , and that he was primarily concerned with the welfare of his crew . 
 The <unk> Committee , which had been set up to investigate the loss of major warships , also produced a report . This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major design failure , which contributed to the loss : Ark Royal depended on electricity for much of her operation , and once the boilers and steam dynamos were knocked out , the loss of power made damage control difficult . The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces , while the uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised . The design flaws were rectified in the <unk> and Implacable @-@ class carriers , under construction at the time . 
 The Board of Inquiry closed its report with the observation that Ark Royal had sunk 22 nautical miles ( 25 mi ; 41 km ) east of Europa Point , the southernmost tip of Gibraltar . This was accepted as the wreck location for 60 years . 
 = = Rediscovery = = 
 The exact location of the wreck remained unknown until mid @-@ December 2002 , when it was discovered by a BBC film crew 30 nautical miles ( 35 mi ; 56 km ) from Gibraltar , more than 1000 metres below surface . The crew had been working on a documentary on maritime archaeology related to major battles of the Royal Navy . Ark Royal lay in two sections : 20 metres ( 66 ft ) of the bow had separated from the rest of the ship . A large debris field , which included the remains of the funnel and bridge island , parts of the ship that came loose as the carrier sank , and aircraft from the hangars , was located between the two hull sections . Analysis revealed that the port side of the ship hit the seabed first . 
 The wreck was found further east than was stated after the sinking . Initially , researchers thought the wreck had been caught in currents through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean as she sank , causing the ship to drift eastwards underwater before settling . The presence of other debris in proximity to the wreck , including a Swordfish bomber that was tipped off the flight deck before the ship rolled , proved this false , as the debris would have been spread over a much wider area . The currents did affect her progress towards Gibraltar , despite being under tow for several hours . Study of the wreck also showed that attempting to restart the engines to provide power increased the stresses placed on the hull , adding to the flooding . Once power was lost , it was impossible to prevent the ship from sinking — her fate was more the result of design flaws than of the actions of her captain . 
 = History of Galveston , Texas = 
 The history of Galveston , Texas , begins with the archaeological record of Native Americans who used the island . The first European settlements on the island were constructed around 1816 . The Port of Galveston was established in 1825 by the Congress of Mexico following its successful revolution from Spain . The city served as the main port for the Texas Navy during the Texas Revolution . Galveston was founded in 1836 by Matthew Sabo and served as the capital of the Republic of Texas . The Battle of Galveston was fought in Galveston Bay during the American Civil War when Confederate forces under Major General John B. Magruder attacked and expelled occupying Union troops from the city . 
 During the mid @-@ 19th century , Galveston emerged as an international city with immigration and trade from around the U.S. and the world . The city became one of the nation 's busiest ports and the world 's leading port for cotton exports . Galveston became Texas ' largest city and , during that era , was its prime commercial center . In 1900 , the island was struck by a devastating hurricane . Even post @-@ Hurricane Katrina , this event holds the record as the United States ' deadliest natural disaster . 
 During the 1920s and 1930s , the city re @-@ emerged as a major tourist destination centered on casinos and other vice businesses . Featuring venues such as the famed Balinese Room the city became nationally known as the sin city of the Gulf . The illegal businesses were finally closed in the 1950s leading to a long , stagnant economic period . Many businesses relocated off of the island though some such as the insurance businesses and the medical school remained . 
 The city gradually re @-@ emerged as a tourist destination centered on its history and its historical buildings . New tourist attractions were established and further development of the medical school and other area businesses have revitalized the economy in recent decades . 
 = = Exploration and settlement = = 
 Galveston Island was originally inhabited by members of the Karankawa and Akokisa tribes who used the name " <unk> " for the island . In 1519 the Alonso Álvarez de Pineda expedition sailed past Galveston Island en route from the Florida peninsula to the Pánuco River . Pineda may or may not have actually seen the island , however , Spain lay claim to the entire Gulf Coast , including Galveston Island , based on the 1519 Pineda expedition . Soon afterward Cabeza de Vaca and his crew were shipwrecked on the island ( or nearby ) in November 1528 , calling it " Isla de <unk> " ( " Isle of Doom " ) , and there began his famous trek to Mexico . Various Spanish explorers charting the region referred to the island as " Isla Blanca " ( " White Island " ) and later " Isla de Aranjuez " ( " Aranjuez Island " ) . In 1685 French explorer La Salle named the island " San Louis " ( " Saint Louis " ) and the name became fixed for some time . 
 The earliest known map of the island and the bay was made by French explorer <unk> de La Harpe in 1721 who left the island unnamed but named the bay " Port François . " In 1785 Spanish explorer José de Evia , during his own charting of the Gulf Coast , referred to the island as " San Luis " and the bay as " Bahía de <unk> " [ sic ] ( " <unk> Bay " ) , in honor of Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid , Count of Gálvez . The name San Luis for the island continued to be used by the Spanish and the Mexicans ( and later even by Stephen F. Austin 's colony ) . 
 The first permanent European settlements on the island were constructed around 1816 by the pirate Louis @-@ Michel Aury as a base of operations to support Mexico 's rebellion against Spain . In 1817 , Aury returned from an unsuccessful raid against Spain to find the island occupied by the pirate Jean Lafitte , who took up residence there after having been driven from his stronghold in Barataria Bay off the coast of New Orleans , Louisiana . Lafitte organized the island 's settlement into a pirate " kingdom " he called " Campeche " , anointing himself the " head of government . " Lafitte remained at Campeche until 1821 when he and his raiders were given an ultimatum by the United States Navy : leave or be destroyed . Lafitte burned his settlement to the ground and sailed under cover of night for parts unknown . 
 Following its successful revolution from Spain , the Congress of Mexico issued a proclamation on October 17 , 1825 , establishing the Port of Galveston , and in 1830 erected a customs house . During the Texas Revolution , Galveston served as the main port for the Texas Navy . Galveston also served as the capital of the Republic of Texas when in 1836 interim president David G. Burnet relocated his government there . In 1836 , Michel <unk> Menard , a native of Canada , along with several associates purchased 4 @,@ 605 acres ( 18 @.@ 64 km2 ) of land for $ 50 @,@ 000 from the Austin Colony to found the town that would become the modern city of Galveston . The Congress of the Republic of Texas hired Robert C. Trimble and William Lindsey to survey this land , and they completed the surveys in 1837 . Menard and his associates began selling plots on April 20 , 1838 . In 1839 , the City of Galveston adopted a charter and was incorporated by the Congress of the Republic of Texas . By this time the name " San Luis " for the island had been abandoned and " Galveston " had become the island 's exclusive name . 
 The city of Galveston became important in the slave trade establishing itself as the largest slave market west of New Orleans . Census records from 1860 show a population of 1178 slaves ( and two free blacks ) compared to 6000 free persons living in the city . The proportion of slaves , however , was somewhat less than the rest of Texas . Tensions over slavery in the U.S. as a whole eventually led to the American Civil War , which Texas joined on the side of the Confederacy . The Battle of Galveston was fought in Galveston Bay and island on January 1 , 1863 , when Confederate forces under Major General John B. Magruder attacked and expelled occupying Union troops from the city , which remained in Confederate hands for the duration of the war . In May 1865 , the Lark successfully evaded the Union blockade off of Galveston Harbor and headed for Havana , becoming the final Confederate ship to slip through the blockade from any Southern port . In the late 1890s , the Fort Crockett defenses and coastal artillery batteries were constructed in Galveston and along the Bolivar Roads . 
 Juneteenth , which is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States , owes its origins to the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation upon the return of Union forces to Galveston in 1865 . Galveston was the first city in Texas to provide a secondary school and public library for African Americans . 
 = = Golden era = = 
 At the end of the 19th century , the city of Galveston was a booming metropolis with a population of 37 @,@ 000 . Its position on the natural harbor of Galveston Bay along the Gulf of Mexico made it the center of trade in Texas , and one of the largest cotton ports in the nation , in competition with New Orleans . Between 1838 and 1842 , 18 newspapers were started to serve the island 's rapidly growing population ( The Galveston County Daily News is the sole survivor ) . A causeway linking the island with the mainland was finished in 1860 , which paved the way for railroad expansion . 
 During this golden era of Galveston 's history , the city was home to a number of state firsts that include the first post office ( 1836 ) , the first naval base ( 1836 ) , the first Texas chapter of a Masonic order ( 1840 ) ; the first cotton compress ( 1842 ) , the first parochial school ( Ursuline Academy ) ( 1847 ) , the first insurance company ( 1854 ) , the first gas lights ( 1856 ) , first Roman Catholic hospital ( St. Mary 's Hospital ) ( 1866 ) , first Jewish Reform Congregation ( Congregation B 'nai Israel ) ( 1868 ) , the first opera house ( 1870 ) , the first orphanage ( 1876 ) , the first telephone ( 1878 ) , the first electric lights ( 1883 ) , the first medical college ( now the University of Texas Medical Branch ) ( 1891 ) , and the first school for nurses ( 1890 ) . 
 Galveston was also home to the first Roman Catholic Cathedral in Texas . In 1839 Rome created the prefecture apostolic of Texas , which was later elevated to a vicariate apostolic on July 10 , 1841 . Then , on May 4 , 1847 Pope Pius IX approved the creation of the Diocese of Galveston and named St. Mary 's Church the Cathedral for the entire state of Texas . 
 During the mid 19th century Galveston , though not a large city by world standards , emerged as an international city with immigration and trade from around the U.S. and around the world . The island has sometimes been called the " Ellis Island of the West " as it was the primary point of entry for European immigrants settling in the western United States . German immigration during this period was so great that the German language became a commonly used language on the city 's streets . The immigrants were not simply the poor or the oppressed seeking refuge but many of the educated , middle class . The Galveston Weekly News described one 1849 ship 's arrival as carrying members of the " wealthy class " including lawyers and merchants and many skilled workers . 
 The later 19th century was a high point in the history of civil rights for African Americans . Reconstruction for a time limited the power of former slaveholders in Texas . Leaders such as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney worked to establish educational and employment opportunities for blacks , and organize black voters to support the Republican Party , then the main party supporting black rights in the South . Cuney 's efforts led to higher employment and higher wages for blacks in the city , especially on the wharves , and eventually led to combined black and white trade unions during the 1890s and early 1900s . Cuney himself rose to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party , the most powerful position held by any black American in the 19th century . 
 = = Storm of 1900 = = 
 In 1900 , the island was struck by a devastating hurricane . Even post @-@ Hurricane Katrina , this event holds the record as the United States ' deadliest natural disaster . In the early morning of September 8 , high surf despite prevailing winds out of the north heralded the oncoming storm . By noon low @-@ lying areas near the Gulf and the Bay side of the city were flooding and the winds increased . Near 4 p.m. a storm surge approximately 15 feet ( 5 m ) high slammed into the coast . Wind speeds reached approximately 125 miles per hour ( 201 km / h ) ( an estimate , since the anemometer was blown off the U.S. Weather Bureau building ) . Isaac Cline was the bureau 's chief meteorologist . An account of the events surrounding the hurricane based on his personal records is given in Isaac 's Storm by Erik Larson . The city was devastated , and an estimated 6 @,@ 000 to 12 @,@ 000 people on the island were killed . After the storm , the city decided to shore up its defenses against future storms by constructing a permanent concrete seawall along a large portion of the beach front ( 1902 – 1904 ) . The entire grade of the city was raised some 17 feet ( 5 m ) behind the wall to several feet near the Bay ( 1904 – 1910 ) . 
 = = Rebuilding and the " Open era " = = 
 Despite attempts to draw new investment to the city after the hurricane , Galveston has never fully returned to its previous levels of national importance or prosperity . Development was also hindered by the construction of the Houston Ship Channel , which brought the Port of Houston into direct competition with the natural harbor of the Port of Galveston for sea traffic . To further her recovery , and rebuild her population , Galveston actively solicited immigration . Through the efforts of Rabbi Henry Cohen and Congregation B 'nai Israel , Galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the Galveston Movement that , between 1907 and 1914 , diverted roughly 10 @,@ 000 Eastern European , Jewish immigrants from the crowded cities of the Northeastern United States . Additionally numerous other immigrant groups , including Greeks , Italians and Russian Jews came to the city during this period . This immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island , as well as many other areas of Texas and the western U.S. 
 Though the storm stalled economic development and the city of Houston grew into the region 's principal metropolis , Galveston regained some of its former glory . Recognizing the need for Galveston to diversify from the traditional port @-@ related industries , in 1905 William Lewis Moody , Jr . , a member of one of Galveston 's leading families , founded the American National Insurance Company . Two years later , Mr. Moody would further invest in Galveston by establishing the City National Bank , which would later become the Moody National Bank . 
 A military facility by the US Army Coastal Artillery on Galveston Island was established in the late 1890s , and construction , which was disrupted by the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 , was completed in the early 1900s , with the facility being named Fort Crockett in 1903 . During the First World War , Fort Crockett served as a US Army artillery training center . Troops bound for France were trained in the use of several types of artillery . During the 1920s and early 1930s , Fort Crockett housed the United States Army Air Corps ' ( USAAC ) 3rd Attack Group ( an ancestor to USAF 's 3rd Wing ) . At this time , the 3rd Attack Group was the only USAAC group devoted solely to attack aircraft . During the Second World War , focus was placed on defense against German U @-@ boats , and the fort also served as a prisoner of war camp . Following the war , Fort Crockett served for several years as an army recreational center . 
 The Galveston – Houston Electric Railway was established in 1911 and ran between the city and Houston . The railway was recognized as the fastest interurban line in 1925 and 1926 . 
 During the 1920s and 1930s , the city re @-@ emerged as a major tourist destination . Under the influence of Sam Maceo and Rosario Maceo , the city exploited the prohibition of liquor and gambling in clubs like the Balinese Room offering entertainment to wealthy Houstonians and other out @-@ of @-@ towners . Combined with prostitution which had existed in the city since the American Civil War , Galveston became known as the sin city of the Gulf . <unk> accepted and even supported the illegal activities , often referring to their island as the " Free State of Galveston . " The island had entered what would later become known as the open era . Aside from the vice @-@ oriented entertainment the city hosted many legitimate entertainment venues and events . One of the most famous was the annual " Pageant of <unk> " beauty contest . This event became the first international contest and attracted participants from England , Russia , Turkey , Brazil , and many other nations until its demise in 1932 . 
 The 1930s and 1940s brought much change to the Island City . During the World War II , the Galveston Municipal Airport , predecessor to Scholes International Airport , was redesignated a U.S. Army Air Corps base and named " Galveston Army Air Field " . The United States Army Corps of Engineers , using funds made available by Congress through the Civil Aeronautics Authority , constructed three 6 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) long , hard @-@ surface runways at the airport to accommodate army aircraft . In January 1943 , Galveston Army Air Field was officially activated with the 46th Bombardment Group serving an anti @-@ submarine role in the Gulf of Mexico . Later it was replaced by the 10th anti @-@ submarine squadron , flying RM @-@ 37 Lockheed Venturas . 
 In 1942 , William Lewis Moody , Jr . , along with his wife Libbie Shearn Rice Moody , established the Moody Foundation , with the purpose of benefiting present and future generations of Texans . " The foundation , one of the largest in the United States , would play a prominent role in Galveston during later decades , helping to fund numerous civic and health @-@ oriented programs . 
 The end of the war drastically reduced military investment in the island . Increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of Las Vegas put pressure on the gaming industry on the island . Finally in 1957 , Texas Attorney General Will Wilson and the Texas Rangers began a massive campaign of raids which wrecked gambling and prostitution in the city . As these vice industries crashed , so did tourism taking the rest of the Galveston economy with it . Neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward . Civic leaders made several failed attempts at new ventures including the failed Oleander Bowl football tournament and the Pelican Island Bridge for access to a new industrial park which never materialized . Nevertheless , key non @-@ entertainment sectors such as insurance , banking , and the medical school helped to keep the economy viable . 
 = = Recent history = = 
 The economy of the island entered a long , stagnant period . Many businesses relocated off of the island . By 1959 , the city of Houston had long out @-@ paced Galveston in population and economic growth . Recognizing this , the Reverend <unk> J. Nold , fifth bishop of the Galveston Diocese , was permitted by the Vatican to erect a Cathedral of convenience in Houston , naming Sacred Heart Church as co @-@ cathedral . The diocese was then re @-@ designated the Diocese of Galveston @-@ Houston . Galveston and St. Mary 's Cathedral Basilica still remained the home of the diocese , but now the bishop could more easily access the rapidly growing Roman Catholic population in Houston . 
 Beginning in 1957 , the Galveston Historical Foundation began its efforts to preserve historic buildings . The 1966 book The Galveston That Was helped encourage the preservation movement . Restoration efforts financed by motivated investors , notably Houston businessman George P. Mitchell , gradually created the Strand Historic District and reinvented other areas . A new , family @-@ oriented tourism emerged in the city over many years . 
 The 1960s saw the expansion of higher education in Galveston . Already home to the University of Texas Medical Branch , the city got a boost in 1962 with the creation of the Texas Maritime Academy , predecessor of Texas A & M University at Galveston ; and by 1967 a community college , Galveston College , had been formed to help provide affordable education to the community . 
 In the 2000s , property values rose after expensive projects were completed and demand for second homes increased . This led some middle class families to move from Galveston to other areas such as League City , Texas City , and La Marque . The city population remained relatively the same from 2000 to 2005 according to the U.S. Census Bureau . In 2007 The Associated Press compiled a list of the most vulnerable places to hurricanes in the U.S. and Galveston was one of five areas named . Among the reasons cited were low elevation and the single evacuation route off the island which is blocked by the fourth largest city in the United States , Houston . 
 Hurricane Ike made landfall on Galveston Island in the early morning of September 13 , 2008 as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 miles per hour ( 180 km / h ) Ike produced waves and a rising storm surge of about 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) , which went around the famous Galveston Seawall , flooding the city via the storm sewers , and the unprotected " bay side " of the island , before the first winds or drop of rain . The storm left Galveston without electricity , gas , water pressure and basic communications . The Balinese Room , an historic nightclub , formerly a notorious illegal gambling hall , which was located on a 600 @-@ foot ( 200 m ) pier extending into the Gulf of Mexico was destroyed in the storm . The island has since re @-@ established services and the population has returned but some damage remains . Discussions are currently under way to build a so @-@ called Ike Dike which would protect Galveston and the bay . As of 2009 the project is still in the conceptual stage and no funding has been allocated . 
 = Portishead , Somerset = 
 Portishead / <unk> / is a coastal town on the Severn Estuary , close to Bristol , but within the unitary authority of North Somerset , which falls within the ceremonial county of Somerset , England . It has a population of around 22 @,@ 000 , an increase of over 3 @,@ 000 since the 2001 census , with a growth rate considerably in excess of surrounding towns . By the time of the 2011 Census the population had increased to approximately 24 @,@ 000 . 
 Portishead has a long history as a fishing port . It expanded rapidly during the early 19th century around the docks , with supporting transport infrastructure . A power station and chemical works were added in the 20th century , but the dock and industrial facilities have since closed and been redeveloped into a marina and residential areas . Portishead was also the telephone control centre used by British Telecom ( BT ) for non @-@ direct dialled calls to maritime vessels , a service known as Portishead Radio . 
 The town 's population is expanding , and Portishead is now primarily a dormitory town for Bristol and its environs , although a range of service industries has grown up . The headquarters of Avon and Somerset Constabulary are in Portishead . 
 = = History = = 
 The name Portishead derives from the " port at the head of the river " . It has been called <unk> and <unk> at times in its history and <unk> in the Domesday Book , and was locally known as <unk> . 
 The town ’ s recorded history dates back to Roman times , although there is also evidence of prehistoric settlement , including polished flint axe heads . There were also Iron Age settlements in the area , of which Cadbury Camp was the largest . Other sites that have been identified include a 1 @,@ 200 by 600 feet ( 370 by 180 m ) site that was successively occupied by the Romans , Britons and Danes . There is some evidence that it may have been the western end of the Wansdyke , an early medieval or possibly Roman boundary with a series of defensive linear earthworks extending to the Savernake Forest near Marlborough in Wiltshire . 
 After the Norman conquest the manor was held by the Bishop of Coutances and later reverted to the crown , after which William II gave it to a merchant from Bristol known as Harding and then to his son Robert Fitzharding who became Lord of Berkeley . The Berkeley family held it for generations until it passed by marriage to the Cokes of Holkham in Norfolk . In the 14th century it belonged to Everard le <unk> . In 1621 the Bristol Corporation purchased large portions of land in Portishead and revived the Manor Court . The rights of the corporation over the manor was disputed but they held it until 1836 when they sold it for £ 8 @,@ 050 . The parish of Portishead was part of the Portbury Hundred . 
 The town was built on the mouth of a small tributary of the Severn Estuary near the mouth of the River Avon . The old pill or jetty provided protection for craft against the Bristol Channel 's large tidal range , and iron rings can be seen in the high street at which fishing boats used to moor . Its position meant Portishead was used to guard the " King Road " , as the waters around the headland are called . In 1497 it was the departure point for John Cabot on the Matthew . A fort was built on Battery Point , and was used during the English Civil War when the town supported the Royalists , but surrendered to Fairfax in 1645 . Guns were also placed at Battery Point during World War II . The King Road was the site of a naval action in 1758 when HMS Antelope captured HMS Belliqueux , one of a French squadron returning from Quebec . 
 A mill was built on <unk> stream but this was replaced by tidal mills . In the 17th century the City of Bristol bought the manors of North Weston and Portishead for access to the channel and as a place to stay outside of the city and , in the 19th century , as a seaside resort . An outer sea wall was built allowing the local marshes to be drained and increased the land available for farming . The dominant architecture is early Victorian , with some buildings maintaining their original features . The expansion in residential property coincided with the construction of the dock , pier and the rail link to Bristol . The Royal Hotel by the pier was built in a Tudor Gothic style in 1830 , to provide accommodation and catering for travellers on the steamers from Bristol , Wales and Ireland . 
 = = = Portishead dock = = = 
 The Act of Parliament governing the enclosure of Portishead was passed in 1814 , and stipulated the right to a public wharf , although there is historical evidence of nautical connections dating back to the Patent Rolls of 1331 . Around the 1860s , at the height of the iron and steel era , a pier and a deep @-@ water dock were built by the Bristol & Portishead Pier and Railway to accommodate the large ships that had difficulty in reaching Bristol Harbour . They brought valuable cargoes from across the globe and exported local products overseas . Ships carrying coal were commonplace in Portishead Docks . 
 In the 1880s Portishead Dock was acquired by Bristol Corporation , and was subsequently managed as part of the Port of Bristol until its closure . 
 = = = Portishead power stations = = = 
 The Portishead power stations were coal @-@ fed power stations built next to the dock . Construction work started on Portishead " A " power station in 1926 . It began generating electricity in 1929 for the Bristol Corporation 's Electricity Department . In 1937 its original six short chimney stacks were replaced by a 350 ft ( 110 m ) high stack . A second 350 ft ( 110 m ) stack was added when the power station was expanded in 1948 . 
 Construction of Portishead " B " power station began in 1949 ; it became operational in 1955 . The power stations became part of the nationalised electricity industry after 1949 , and were operated in turn by the British Electricity Authority , the Central Electricity Authority and the CEGB . They used some local coal produced in the Somerset coalfield , which was delivered by train along the Portishead branch of the Great Western Railway ( GWR ) . The line had opened on 12 April 1867 as the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company ; it opened to the dock on 5 July 1879 . The main supply of coal was imported by boat from Newport and Ely in South Wales ; it was carried by Osborn & Wallis of Bristol . 
 = = = Railways = = = 
 Portishead had two passenger stations on the GWR 's Portishead branch line . The main station was near the centre of the village of Portishead , as it was then ; the other was at the pier . The construction of Portishead " B " power station caused the original railway station to be demolished and a replacement station was opened in the High Street on 2 January 1954 . The new station closed on 7 September 1964 . 
 The majority of the line was reopened in 2002 , to transport goods from the Royal Portbury Dock . A new junction was created , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from Portishead station , and a new goods line built from there to the Royal Portbury Dock . There is a campaign group aimed at reopening the station and the short stretch of unopened line . In 2009 a report by the Association of Train Operating Companies stated that the Portishead branch was a special case for future consideration of reopening due to the large projected increase in population and congestion in the area . 
 Portishead also had a second , short @-@ lived , railway line : the Weston , Clevedon and Portishead Railway . It ran between Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare and Clevedon as a standard railway line , and between Clevedon and Portishead as a light railway . The Clevedon to Portishead extension opened on 7 August 1907 . The line closed on 19 May 1940 and was then dismantled by the GWR . 
 = = = Albright and Wilson = = = 
 In 1951 , Albright and Wilson built a chemical works on the opposite side of the dock from the power stations . The chemical works produced white phosphorus from phosphate rock imported , through the docks , into the UK . Phosphate rock was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required . Electricity provided by the local power stations was used to run six 7 @.@ 5 megawatt electric arc furnaces ( 45 MW total ) that reduced the phosphate rock . The phosphorus was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby . After the closure of the factory the decontamination included the removal of yellow ( spontaneously combustible ) and red allotropes of phosphorus . The site is now home to Portishead volunteer coastguard . 
 = = = Closure of the dock and associated facilities = = = 
 The onset of new generating capacity at Pembroke ( oil @-@ fired ) and Didcot ( coal @-@ fired ) in the mid @-@ 1970s brought about the closure of the older , less efficient " A " Station . One generator ( 500 MW ) of four at each of the new power stations had almost the same output of both Portishead Stations combined ( " A " Station 200 MW , " B " Station 360 MW ) . 
 The newer of the two power stations ( " B " Station ) was converted to burn oil when the Somerset coalfields closed . The two Radstock pits ceased production in September 1973 and the last train load of coal departed on 16 November 1973 . The price of oil rose steeply in the 1970s ( see 1973 oil crisis and 1979 oil crisis ) and the two power stations were little used after these events . 
 Portishead " A " power station was closed in 1976 ; and the first of its two chimney stacks , a landmark , was demolished in September 1981 , followed by the second in August 1982 . Portishead " B " power station closed in 1982 and both of its 383 feet ( 117 m ) stacks were demolished in October 1992 . 
 Industrial activities ceased at the dock with the closure of the power stations . The Port of Bristol Authority finally closed the dock in 1992 . 
 = = = Modern Marina Development = = = 
 Much of the growth of Portishead 's population can be attributed to the development of the former docks into a vibrant community . The former deep @-@ water dock , used to supply coal and goods to the power stations , has been fully redeveloped into a modern marina with 250 pontoon berths . 
 The areas on each side of the marina , formerly occupied by the two power stations and chemical plant , have been redeveloped to provide a wide range of housing , from town houses to social housing to exclusive flats . Development has also completed on the Portbury Ashlands to the east of the harbour ( so @-@ called because they were the dumping ground for power station waste ) extending the area of the town further towards Portbury . Next to the Ashlands development lies Portbury Ashlands Nature Reserve . 
 This waterfront development is now known as Port Marine . The area has varied styles of housing , including an area built in the style of a fishing village , which is modelled on the Cornish seaside town of Polperro with narrow streets and multi @-@ coloured houses . New waterside bars and restaurants , including Hall & Woodhouse , Aqua and <unk> have opened around the marina , with further outlets are set to open in the future , including Costa Coffee and a nearby Wetherspoons . 
 = = = Portishead Radio = = = 
 Portishead was previously the telephone control centre used by British Telecom ( BT ) for non @-@ direct dialled calls to maritime vessels , a service known as " Portishead Radio " . This has now been largely replaced by <unk> , which permits directly dialled calls made from any BT landline in the UK . The radio station had separate transmitting and receiving stations . They were constructed by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company and operated by the General Post Office ( GPO ) . By 1936 , the station had a staff of 60 radio officers who handled over 3 million words of radio traffic per year . Following the privatisation of the GPO 's telephone network in 1981 , the station was operated by British Telecommunications PLC ( now known as BT Group PLC ) . The main transmitting station , which was remotely operated , originally consisted of a large array of radio masts at nearby Portishead Downs but was replaced by a single radio mast at Clevedon . It was used until the 1970s . The receiving station 's control centre and radio masts were located at Highbridge , near Burnham @-@ on @-@ Sea . 
 The radio station played a vital role during the Second World War in maintaining communications with the British merchant navy and with patrol aircraft in the North Atlantic . During the war , all communications with ships were one @-@ way in order to avoid revealing the ships ' locations to the enemy . The station was short @-@ staffed because many were on secondments to various government services , such as operating other radio stations and training new radio officers to work in naval convoys . In 1943 , the workload was so great that a Royal Navy officer and 18 telegraphists were brought in from HMS <unk> , a Naval Shore Wireless Service station near Winchester . 
 By the end of the 1980s , satellite communications had started to take an increasing share of the station 's business , and a programme of severe rationalisation began , leading to the closure of two transmitting sites at Leafield and Ongar . In the radio station 's penultimate year to March 1999 , there were on average , per month , 571 radio telegrams , 533 radio telephone calls and 4 @,@ 001 radio telex calls . In 1998 , British Telecom Maritime Radio Services announced its planned closure of Portishead Radio . The long @-@ range services ( HF bands 3 – 30 MHz ) ceased at midnight on 31 August 1999 . The short @-@ range VHF maritime band services ( 156 – 174 MHz ) closed at 12 : 00 on Sunday 30 April 2000 , and the medium @-@ range services ( MF maritime band 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 0 MHz ) at 12 : 00 on Friday 30 June . The station closed in April 2000 . The Highbridge station has been demolished . Sedgemoor District Council adopted a local development plan in September 2004 that included the site of the receiving station for future housing development . Planning permission was granted in October 2007 for a development of 190 houses and flats on the site and shortly afterwards the old radio station buildings were demolished . 
 = = Governance = = 
 The town is the larger area served by the town council of Portishead and North Weston . The council is made up of 18 councillors representing six wards : Portishead Central , Portishead Coast , Portishead East , Portishead South & North Weston , Portishead Redcliffe Bay , and Portishead West . It has responsibility for local issues , including setting an annual precept ( local rate ) to cover the council ’ s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny . The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police , district council officers , and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime , security , and traffic . The town council 's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities , such as the village hall or community centre , playing fields and playgrounds , as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance , repair , and improvement of highways , drainage , footpaths , public transport , and street cleaning . Conservation matters ( including trees and listed buildings ) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council . 
 The town falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset , although the area below high @-@ water mark , including the pier , is within Bristol . Before 1974 , the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District . The police service is provided by Avon and Somerset Constabulary .

 Portishead is a coastal town on the Severn Estuary . It lies north west of Clevedon and immediately south west of Avonmouth just across the River Avon , which forms the boundary between Somerset and Bristol . The city of Bristol is 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) to the east and Portishead is approximately 110 miles ( 180 km ) west of London . On clear days , Wales can be seen across the Severn Estuary from the town . The Eastwood area has been designated as a local nature reserve . It consists broadleaf woodland on a coastal limestone ridge which leads to Battery Point which had a defensive gun position and Portishead Point lighthouse is on the promontory . There is also geological interest in the fossils , folds and faults found in the area . 
 The area immediately inland includes the Gordano Valley , which has been designated as a national nature reserve . The valley runs roughly north @-@ east to south @-@ west , between Carboniferous limestone ridges extending along the coastline between Clevedon and Portishead , and another ridge extending between Clevedon and Easton in Gordano . The area includes the villages of Clapton in Gordano , Weston in Gordano , Easton in Gordano , Walton in Gordano , Portbury and <unk> . The M5 motorway runs along the south side of the valley , splitting briefly into two levels – the south @-@ west @-@ bound level running above the north @-@ east @-@ bound carriageway . The Gordano motorway service station is at the eastern end of the valley , near the Royal Portbury Dock and the Avonmouth Bridge . There is no river Gordano – much of the valley is reclaimed land barely above sea level , drained by ditches ( known locally as " rhynes " ) . The rhynes previously managed by the now amalgamated Gordano Valley Internal Drainage Board are now the responsibility of the North Somerset Internal Drainage Board . An area comprising a total of 400 acres ( 160 ha ) has been designated as a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest , for ornithological , entomological and stratigraphic interest , notification originally having taken place in 1971 . Several sites in the valley are managed by the Avon Wildlife Trust as nature reserves . These include Weston Big Wood , Clapton Moor , Weston Moor and Walton Common . The name Gordano comes from Old English and is descriptive of the triangular shape of the whole valley from Clevedon to Portishead , being the ablative singular of the Latinised form of Gorden meaning muddy valley . 
 Denny Island is a small rocky island of 0 @.@ 6 acres ( 0 @.@ 2 ha ) , with scrub vegetation , approximately three miles north of Portishead . Its rocky southern foreshore marks the boundary between England and Wales , but the island itself is reckoned administratively to Monmouthshire , Wales . The tidal rise and fall in the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel can be as great as 49 ft ( 15 m ) , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada . There has been concern about pollution levels from industrial areas in Wales and at the eastern end of the Bristol Channel ; however , this tends to be diluted by the Atlantic waters . There are measurable levels of chemical pollutants , but little is known about their effects . Of particular concern are the levels of cadmium and to a lesser degree residual pesticides and hydrocarbons . 
 Portishead Pier to Black Nore SSSI is a 177 @-@ acre ( 72 ha ) geological Site of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1952 . The Portishead Pier Section is made up of alluvial sandstones , the best exposure of Upper Carboniferous rocks in the Avonmouth Coalfield . The cliff and foreshore exposures around Portishead Point provide important exposures of geological structures formed during the Variscan mountain building episode in the Carboniferous Period of geological history . Also included are important exposures of the Devonian sequence that yield several species of fossil fish . <unk> scales are the most abundant fossils , but teeth scales of other species are also relatively common . Notably amongst the collection from this bed are plates of <unk> , including <unk> . Eastwood and Battery Point Local Nature Reserve is a 9 hectares ( 22 acres ) woodland containing Yew , Maple , Dogs mercury and beech . 
 The Lake Grounds area , built in the early 20th century around an artificial lake , is the town 's main park . Adjacent to the beach and esplanade is a 100 @-@ year @-@ old artificial lake , and a cricket pitch surrounded by sloping lawns interspersed with specimen trees . One of the UK 's few surviving outdoor swimming pools is situated on the shore next to the lake grounds and is open during the summer months . In 2009 , the outdoor pool was renovated by a team filming for the American TV programme Ty 's Great British Adventure . Above the lake grounds is Battery Point , where a gun battery was sited to protect the Severn Estuary from invasion .

 Along with the rest of South West England , Portishead has a temperate climate generally wetter and milder than the rest of England . The annual mean temperature is about 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) with seasonal and diurnal variations , but the modifying effect of the sea restricts the range to less than that in most other parts of the United Kingdom . January is the coldest month , with mean minimum temperatures between 1 ° C ( 34 ° F ) and 2 ° C ( 36 ° F ) . July and August are the warmest , with mean daily maxima around 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) . In general , December is the dullest month and June the sunniest . The south @-@ west of England enjoys a favoured location , particularly in summer , when the Azores High extends its influence north @-@ eastwards towards the UK . 
 Cloud often forms inland , especially near hills , and reduces exposure to sunshine . The average annual sunshine is about 1 @,@ 600 hours . Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection . In summer , convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year . Average rainfall is around 800 – 900 mm ( 31 – 35 in ) . About 8 – 15 days of snowfall is typical . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds , with June to August having the lightest ; the prevailing wind direction is from the south @-@ west .

 Transport links to Bristol and beyond have been a concern for some residents of the town and a group has been set up to campaign for the reopening of the Portishead to Bristol railway line . The cost has been estimated at £ 28 million , and feasibility plans are being considered . 
 The main A369 road , known after the historical name for the area as " The Portbury Hundred " , which links the town to the nearby M5 motorway , is prone to congestion , especially during rush hours . Major traffic @-@ flow modifications have caused much controversy because they are widely seen as having caused queuing where none existed before . More than 4 @,@ 000 residents signed a petition to North Somerset Council expressing concern at the development . 
 In September 2009 a trial was undertaken to turn off traffic lights in Portishead . It was conducted in association with North Somerset Council , Martin Cassini and Colin Buchanan . The change was made permanent after some journey times reportedly fell by over 50 % with no measured reduction in pedestrian safety , despite greater numbers now using the route ( over 2000 vehicles and 300 pedestrians an hour ) . 
 Portishead is served by several bus routes , including the half @-@ hourly X2 and X3 , all to Bristol , as well as local buses such as the Route 88 to <unk> ( actually split into 88A and 88C ) and the X5 to Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare or the University Of The West Of England ( UWE ) .

 " Theatricality " is the twentieth episode of the American television series Glee . The episode was written and directed by series creator Ryan Murphy , and premiered on the Fox network on May 25 , 2010 . In " Theatricality " , glee club member Tina Cohen @-@ Chang ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) has an identity crisis . The female club members and Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) pay tribute to Lady Gaga , performing in a selection of her costumes , while the rest of the male club members perform as Kiss . Rachel ( Lea Michele ) meets her mother Shelby ( Idina Menzel ) , the coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline , and Finn ( Cory Monteith ) and his mother move in with Kurt and his father , leading to a confrontation between Kurt and Finn . The episode features cover versions of five songs , all of which were released as singles , available for digital download , and three of which are included on the soundtrack album Glee : The Music , Volume 3 Showstoppers . 
 " Theatricality " was watched by 11 @.@ 5 million American viewers and received generally positive reviews from critics . Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly deemed it one of his favorite episodes of the season , and both Terri Schwartz of MTV and CNN 's Lisa Respers France compared it positively to the Madonna tribute episode , " The Power of Madonna " . O 'Malley 's acting and the Kurt and Finn storyline attracted critical praise , although Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post felt that similar scenes between Kurt and Burt were becoming increasingly frequent , diminishing their impact . BuddyTV 's Henrik Batallones and Mary Hanrahan of Broadway World highlighted pacing issues with the Rachel storyline , and Hanrahan and Kevin Coll of Fused Film criticized the use of " Poker Face " as a mother – daughter duet .

 Principal Figgins ( Iqbal Theba ) informs Tina ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) that she can no longer dress as a goth , alarmed by a spate of pseudo @-@ vampirism in the school , inspired by the Twilight series . She briefly changes her style , before dressing as a vampire and convincing Figgins that if he does not allow her to wear her preferred clothes , her vicious Asian vampire father will bite him . 
 Rachel ( Lea Michele ) discovers that rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline is planning on performing a Lady Gaga number at Regionals , so glee club director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) sets the club a Gaga assignment . The girls and Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) create costumes inspired by Lady Gaga and perform " Bad Romance " . The rest of the male club members , unwilling to do a Gaga number , dress as Kiss and perform " Shout It Out Loud " . Puck ( Mark Salling ) suggests to Quinn ( Dianna Agron ) that they name their daughter Jackie Daniels , as in Jack Daniel 's . Later , in an attempt to show her he is serious about being a father , he does another Kiss song with the guys , " Beth " , and suggests that Quinn give that name to their daughter . Quinn agrees that he can be present at her birth . 
 While spying on a Vocal Adrenaline rehearsal , Rachel realizes that their director , Shelby Corcoran ( Idina Menzel ) , is her biological mother . She introduces herself , and Shelby makes her a better Lady Gaga costume . Will meets with Shelby , concerned that she is not as invested in forging a relationship as Rachel is . Shelby confesses that she can no longer have children , but wishes she could have her baby back , rather than the now fully grown Rachel , whom she feels does not need her . She tells Rachel that instead of trying to act like mother and daughter , they should just be grateful that they have met , and maintain their distance . Rachel hugs her goodbye , and they duet on an acoustic version of " Poker Face " . 
 Kurt 's father Burt Hummel ( Mike O 'Malley ) invites Finn ( Cory Monteith ) and his mother Carole Hudson ( Romy Rosemont ) to move in with them . Finn feels awkward sharing a room with Kurt , who has a crush on him and keeps trying to seduce him , and during an argument insults several items in his bedroom as being " faggy " after losing his temper . Burt overhears this and kicks Finn out for using the term , even if it costs Burt his relationship with Carole . Kurt is bullied for his Gaga costume by football players Dave Karofsky ( Max Adler ) and Azimio ( James Earl ) . Finn creates his own costume out of a shower curtain , and tells them he will not let them hurt Kurt , backed by the rest of the glee club .

 " Theatricality " was originally intended to air on June 1 , 2010 , but was switched in the schedule with the episode " Funk " . The impetus for the Lady Gaga tribute comes from Tina 's conflict , with Ushkowitz explaining that the storyline reflects Tina " slowly coming out of her box . Making her way out of her shell . " As well as allowing Glee the rights to her songs , Lady Gaga also loaned the series her costume designer to recreate her signature looks . Series creator Ryan Murphy , who also directed the episode , stated that , because of the elaborate staging and costuming , the performance of " Bad Romance " was the show 's most expensive number to date . " Bad Romance " took six hours to film , with Murphy describing it as " big and athletic and hard . " Michele damaged her knee from exertion during the performance . In a statement released to Entertainment Weekly , Gaga eagerly anticipated the covers of her songs : " I love Glee . I love the cast and the creativity of the writers . I went to a musical theatre school , and used to dream that someday the students would be singing my songs . Can ’ t wait for " Bad Romance " + " Poker Face " in Glee fashion ! " 
 Glee 's costume designer Lou Eyrich deemed the episode a tribute to Lady Gaga 's " genius " , explaining that the costumes the characters wear are not exact replicas of Gaga 's , giving the impression the glee club members made them themselves . Rachel wears two dresses , the first inspired by Gaga 's Kermit the Frog dress and the second based on Gaga 's silver mirrored triangle dress . Murphy selected Tina to wear the Hussein Chalayan – inspired bubble dress , which Eyrich adapted into a vest to make it easier to take on and off . Kurt 's costume is inspired by the Alexander McQueen outfit Gaga wears in the " Bad Romance " video , described by Colfer as " George Washington meets an Oceanic whale disco ball type thing " . Eyrich strove for authenticity in replicating McQueen 's ten @-@ inch ' Armadillo ' platforms . She was unable to buy a pair to fit Colfer , as they were not made in large enough sizes . Quinn wears the Armani Privé orbit dress Gaga wore to the 52nd Grammy Awards , fitted around her pregnant stomach . The most complicated costume was the Philip Treacy lobster hat , worn by Brittany ( Heather Morris ) , as to get it to stay in place during the " Bad Romance " dance , Eyrich had to build a <unk> orb which could be safety – pinned on her head , then solder steel tentacles onto the sphere . It took 45 minutes to get the hat on and off Morris each day , and restricted her vision to what was directly in front of her . In solidarity with Kurt , Finn wears a vinyl floor – length red dress , based on the latex Atsuko Kudo dress Gaga wore to meet Elizabeth II . Mercedes wears a glittery bodysuit and a purple hair bow and wig , and Santana wears the Jeffrey Bryant lace bodysuit , and black rose Charlie Le Mindu hat , with lace airbrushed onto her face . As mentioned in the episode , members of Vocal Adrenaline wear red Chantilly lace full @-@ body outfits and headpieces ( as well as blonde wigs ) inspired by the Fall 1998 Alexander McQueen dress Gaga wore whilst accepting her award for Best New Artist at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards . 
 The episode includes an acoustic performance of Lady Gaga 's " Poker Face " , performed by Rachel and her mother Shelby . Menzel explained that the sexual meaning of the song is different in the context of the show , calling it " actually very simple and truthful . " The male glee club members , except Kurt , perform " Beth " and " Shout It Out Loud " by Kiss , while Shelby also sings " Funny Girl " from the film of the same name . " Speechless " was featured as background music in the scene where Finn wiped off his Kiss makeup while Kurt fixes his outfit . All of the songs performed in the episode were released as singles , available for digital download . " Poker Face " and " Beth " are included on the deluxe edition of the soundtrack album Glee : The Music , Volume 3 Showstoppers , while " Bad Romance " is included on both the deluxe and standard editions of the album . " Bad Romance " charted at number 91 in Australia , 46 in Canada , 10 in Ireland , 59 in the United Kingdom , and 54 in the United States , while " Poker Face " charted at number 26 in Canada , 16 in Ireland , 70 in the United Kingdom , and 20 in the United States . 
 Recurring guest star Mike O 'Malley appears in the episode as Kurt 's father Burt , sharing a scene with Colfer and Monteith which Colfer has described as the most emotional scene of the series thus far , explaining : " Reading it on paper I had no idea it was going to be that intense . Once I got into it , then I kind of realised , ' Oh , there 's such a bigger meaning behind this . Oh my God , this is so dramatic ' . " Colfer called " Theatricality " his favorite episode of the whole series . Other recurring characters who appear in " Theatricality " are glee club members Santana Lopez ( Naya Rivera ) , Brittany Pierce ( Heather Morris ) , Mike Chang ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) and Matt Rutherford ( Dijon Talton , who gets his first lines in this episode ) , school reporter Jacob Ben Israel ( Josh Sussman ) , school athletes and bullies Karofsky and Azimio , Principal Figgins , Vocal Adrenaline coach Shelby Corcoran and Finn 's mother Carole Hudson .

At the beginning of each race , the player can perform a " Turbo Start " , which allows the player to start the race at full speed . Throughout races , the player can also perform power slides and " Super Slides " , which allow the player 's car to turn around corners more sharply . 
 Each of the game 's tracks contain power up bricks , which can be collected by the player and used to gain an advantage over other racers . The power ups are divided into four categories : Projectile , Hazard , Shield and Turbo , with each providing a different use to the player . The player can also collect up to three " power plus " bricks , which increase the capability of any power ups collected . Race tracks also contain various shortcuts that can be opened by the player interacting with the environment , sometimes needing to be triggered by power ups . These shortcuts give players alternate routes through tracks , allowing them to complete races quicker . During a race , the in @-@ game HUD displays the player 's position , lap number , " lap timers " , and a " Power Up Icon " if the player is carrying any power up or power plus bricks . The player can also choose between viewing the " <unk> " , the " Course Map " or the " Close @-@ up Map " . 
 The game contains three single @-@ player modes : " Circuit Race " , " Single Race " and " Time Race " , as well as one multiplayer mode , " Versus Race " . The Circuit Race mode follows the game 's main plot , and allows players to race through circuits made up of multiple tracks , gaining points based on where they place . In a circuit , the player must earn enough points to move on to the next race , and will win if they finish with the most points . Placing third or above in a circuit unlocks the next circuit for the player . The Single Race mode allows the player to race on a single track unlocked from the Circuit Race mode . The Time Race mode places the player in a race against Veronica Voltage driving a ghost car with the aim of beating her best time around a track chosen by the player . Versus Race allows two players to race against each other in a split screen view without non @-@ player character minifigures on the track . 
 Throughout the game , the player can unlock various brick sets and character pieces by completing certain tasks , such as coming first in a Circuit Race . The game 's " Build Menu " allows the player to build custom cars , minifigures and driving licenses of their own design using unlocked bricks and character parts . <unk> can be customized with different hat , hair , head , body and leg parts , and given a name entered by the player on the minifigure 's driving license . A picture of the player 's minifigure is also placed on their driving license , and their facial expression can be changed by the player . The player can create a custom car using a combination of different chassis and car sets . The player can rotate , move and place bricks from these sets directly on to the chassis . Placement of the bricks changes the car 's balance and weight , which affects its overall performance . The " Mix " and " Quick Build " option creates minifigures and cars from randomly selected parts , respectively . 
 = = Development = = 
 The concept for Lego Racers was initially created by High Voltage Software founder Kerry Ganofsky , with the idea of players being able to build and race cars created with Lego bricks . After a year of development , Lego Media began production of the game , hiring Ganofsky 's company to develop it . Lego Media and other facilities within The Lego Group collaborated with High Voltage Software during the production of the game . 
 A large number of character models , documents and pictures from different Lego System characters and models were sent to the developers , who eventually chose to use the Castle , Space , Adventurers and Pirates themes in the game . High Voltage Software chose the characters they liked best from these themes and created character studies for them to " capture the mood of each persona " . Certain characters were focused on as " champs " in the game , while others were featured as racers . The developers also created two original characters , Rocket Racer and Veronica Voltage . 
 High Voltage Software spent over a year creating Lego Racers ' car building mechanics . The game 's lead programmer , Dwight <unk> , created a formula that was used by the game 's artists to create individual Lego elements in the game . The pieces available to the player were selected from hundreds of Lego elements by the developers , chosen first by aesthetics , and then analysed to see if they would fit into <unk> 's formula . The developers chose to affect the attributes of the player 's car , such as handling , acceleration and top speed , through how many bricks are placed on the chassis , as this is simpler to understand for the game 's main age demographic . 
 Due to the high number of Lego sets and pieces in the game , a custom mesh code was created to " weld " the geometry in place and optimize the cars polygon count , creating one solid mesh for each car created by the player . Every element in the game , including bricks and character pieces , had different levels of detail created for use in menu screens and cut scenes , where the models had to be a higher quality due to the player seeing them up close . The developers planned a feature where bricks would break apart from the car upon crashing , but this presented " too many problems to make it a real possibility " . Lego Racers was available to play before release by journalists at E3 1999 .

 Lego Racers received a range of review scores , with the Microsoft Windows , Nintendo 64 and PlayStation releases getting a mix of high and low scoring reviews . On aggregate website GameRankings , it received an average score of 75 % based on 11 reviews for the PC version , 63 % based on 3 reviews for the PlayStation version , and 66 % based on 8 reviews for the Nintendo 64 version . 
 The game 's graphics were generally praised by critics . GameSpot 's Andrew Park stated that virtually everything in the PC version " looks bright , colorful and clean " when playing in 3D @-@ accelerated mode , but called its texturing minimal . GameSpot 's Ben Stahl also called the N64 version 's track design " innovative and cute " , as well as saying the tracks and backgrounds have a " somewhat real look " that makes it easier to tell where the player should be driving . IGN 's reviewer for the PC version praised the game 's background animations , stating that they not only " add to the atmosphere of the game , but also affect the way it plays " . However , some reviewers criticised the game 's performance , with IGN 's Sam Bishop stating that the PlayStation version 's load times between levels are horrendous and Next Generation 's Chris Charla calling the N64 version 's framerate " <unk> slow " . Conversely , IGN 's Winnie Imperio called the N64 version 's framerate " consistent , if not entirely smooth " . 
 Lego Racers ' gameplay received a mixed reaction from critics . Charla called creating and testing cars a lot of fun , especially because the way a car is built has " a major effect on how it controls " , and IGN 's reviewer for the PC version found that unlocking new bricks in the circuit mode for use in car customization is addictive . However , Stahl called the game 's construction system unfriendly , stating that the player is " better off just sticking with one of the default vehicles " . Imperio said that handling the cars is " surprisingly tight " , calling the N64 control scheme intuitive . Conversely , Charla found that most of the cars feel top @-@ heavy , and stated that the racing is awful . IGN 's reviewer for the PC version praised the power up system , calling it pretty cool , as well as stating that the Power Plus bricks add " a new strategy to the game " , but Stahl called the system " terribly lame " . Reviewers also criticised the game 's multiplayer features , with IGN 's PC reviewer calling the split screen mode simple , and an Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer stating that the " lack of multiplayer options " hurts Lego Racers ' replay value . 
 Other aspects of Lego Racers ' design also received mixed opinions from critics . One of Electronic Gaming Monthly 's reviewers called the game 's race tracks " short , unimaginative and devoid of good shortcuts " . Imperio called the track design " simplistic and often not very difficult " , but " still well designed and a lot of fun to race through " . Park called the game 's music cheery and upbeat , while Stahl called it " barely acceptable " , stating that it " gets irritating rather quickly " , as well as calling the game 's sound effects " decidedly poor " . Bishop said that the sound effects " lack crispness " , citing their low sample rate as a reason , as well as calling the game 's music " flat " .

 = Pennsylvania Route 21 = 
 Pennsylvania Route 21 ( PA 21 ) is a 50 @.@ 75 @-@ mile ( 81 @.@ 67 km ) long east – west state highway in the US state of Pennsylvania . The western terminus of the route is at the West Virginia state line in <unk> Township , where PA 21 continues into West Virginia as West Virginia Route 891 . The eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 40 Business in Uniontown . The route is known as the Roy E. Furman Highway for most of its length . PA 21 serves Waynesburg and Masontown along the way . 
 PA 21 was originally designated in 1927 between the West Virginia border and Uniontown , originally following an alignment further to the north between Carmichaels and Uniontown via New Salem . By 1950 , the route was moved to its current alignment east of Carmichaels , with bypasses of Carmichaels and Masontown constructed by 1960 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Pennsylvania Route 21 enters Greene County in <unk> Township near the village of Polen . The highway winds its way through the hilly and sparsely populated area passing Ryerson Station State Park to the north . It continues to the northeast into Gray Township where it veers to the southeast toward the village of Rogersville in Center Township . Just before reaching Rogersville , Route 21 merges with Pennsylvania Route 18 near West Greene High School . Route 18 leaves Route 21 near West Waynesburg while Route 21 continues into the borough of Waynesburg . 
 In Waynesburg , PA 21 is a one @-@ way pair as High Street ( west ) and Greene Street ( east ) . Both streets are two lanes in the borough . High Street is the arterial road through Waynesburg 's business district . While in Waynesburg , it shares its route with U.S. Route 19 . PA 21 leaves Waynesburg entering the census @-@ designated place of Morrisville . PA 21 becomes a two @-@ lane road with a shared left turn lane for less than a mile before US 19 leaves the route and PA 21 stays east , becoming a four lane divided highway . Interstate 79 exit 14 is PA 21 in Morrisville signed for PA 21 to Masontown and Waynesburg . PA 21 then leaves Morrisville in Jefferson Township . 
 PA 21 travels east @-@ southeast through the rest of rural Greene County . The road is mostly level and the countryside is mostly farmland . In Paisley , PA 21 intersects Pennsylvania Route 88 , then becomes a four @-@ lane divided highway until it crosses the Masontown Bridge over the Monongahela River . 
 PA 21 enters Fayette County in the borough of Masontown . It bypasses Masontown to the north and merges with PA 166 ( Main St. ) . After leaving Masontown , the southernmost point on the route , PA 21 becomes <unk> Road . It turns to the northeast entering German Township and leaving PA 166 . Passing through <unk> , PA 21 traverses more densely populated western Fayette County entering South Union Township . The highway enters South Union Township in the village of <unk> . It intersects Dixon Boulevard before entering the city of Uniontown . It has an interchange with U.S. Route 40 / U.S. Route 119 near Cherry Tree Square . It passes the Uniontown Hospital before ending at US Route 40 Business ( Main St. ) .

 In 1911 , what would become PA 21 was designated as part of Legislative Route 256 between the West Virginia border and Rogersville , Legislative Route 111 between Rogersville and Waynesburg , and Legislative Route 112 between Waynesburg and Uniontown . PA 21 was designated in 1927 to run from the West Virginia border east to US 40 in Uniontown . The route followed its current alignment to west of Carmichaels , where it headed east by way of Carmichaels and New Salem to Uniontown . The alignment utilized a ferry across the Monongahela River . By the time of its inception , PA 21 existed as a paved road between Wind Ridge and PA 121 east of Waynesburg , in the Carmichaels area , and from south of Republic to Uniontown . The remainder of PA 21 was paved by 1940 . By 1950 , PA 21 was rerouted to follow PA 88 between Carmichaels and Paisley , where it turned east and crossed the Monongahela River at Masontown and followed its current alignment to Uniontown . Bypasses of Carmichaels and Masontown were built by 1960 . Also by this time , PA 21 was widened into a divided highway near the PA 88 intersection in Paisley , By 1970 , a portion of PA 21 east of Waynesburg was converted to a divided highway . Improvements , including a new bridge over the Monongahela River , are in the plans for the future .

 = Carlton Hill ( Erie Railroad station ) = 
 Carlton Hill Station was a former railroad station for the Erie Railroad in the Rutherford , New Jersey , United States . Carlton Hill station was the second station along the Erie 's main line and the first station after Rutherford Junction , where the Erie 's main line forked from the Bergen County Railroad . The station provided service for passengers in Rutherford and Wallington " s Carlton Hill district and freight billing for the Royce Chemical Company , producer of <unk> . After Carlton Hill , the main line continued westward to Passaic Park and eastward to Rutherford – East Rutherford and Pavonia Terminal . 
 Carlton Hill Station opened in 1888 on Jackson Avenue and namesake Erie Avenue in Rutherford . The station was served by the main line until 1963 , when the Passaic Plan was undertaken , removing tracks at Passaic Park , Passaic , Clifton , and Lake View stations . At that point , the nearby drawbridge was permanently swung open and later removed , leaving a branch to Carlton Hill . For the next few years , Carlton Hill received deadhead trains and a rare Carlton Hill – Rutherford – Hoboken Terminal train schedule . In 1966 , when several underused branches , including the Carlton Hill , lost service , the old main line alignment to Carlton Hill was abandoned . The tracks remain , though the building is gone .

 Carlton Hill Station was situated at the intersection with Jackson Avenue in Rutherford , where the Erie Railroad 's main line crossed , 10 @.@ 75 miles ( 17 @.@ 30 km ) away from New York City 's Chambers Street Ferry Terminal . The main line crossed through Carlton Hill on two tracks , separated by inter @-@ track fencing . There was one main line platform , next to the station depot , which was located on the eastbound side of the tracks . During the morning commuter rush , Carlton Hill was full of commuters heading for New York City . After the commuter rush , a station agent 's work was to inspect the yard and complete freight billing for the Royce Chemical Company . The yard commonly had boxcars , empty and loaded waiting for pick @-@ up . Although the station no longer gets use , the former site is accessible via New Jersey Transit 's buses # 160 and # 190 along with a walk down to Jackson Avenue . The former station site and trackage are owned by Norfolk Southern Railway .

The wooden station was the common design for station depots used by the Erie Railroad , designated Type IV . In 1889 , upon opening of the station , formerly called West Rutherford , the station received eighteen trains from New York City and Jersey City daily , seventeen to New York City daily , and ten fewer trips on weekend each . The fare to get to Carlton Hill from Jersey City was $ 0 @.@ 35 for one @-@ way tickets , and $ 0 @.@ 50 for round trips .

 On September 6 , 1911 , a woman named Elizabeth King was struck and killed by an Erie Railroad passenger train at Carlton Hill . The woman , heading to Passaic to visit her daughter in the local hospital for an operation , was of poor eyesight and was unable to see the train . At the time , the Erie had not implemented <unk> fencing , but the intersection with Jackson Avenue had been given flashing lights and bells to signify the oncoming train . After the incident , the New Jersey State Legislature got involved with the case and gave the Erie suggestions to add <unk> fencing at Carlton Hill to prevent another such incident .

 During the 1950s and 1960s , several different priorities from different agencies around the cities of Paterson and Passaic were beginning to form . The Delaware , Lackawanna and Western , a competing railroad with the Erie , wanted to condense ( along with the Erie ) services and share trackage because of financial troubles . Secondly , the city officials in Passaic had first brought a proposal to the Erie asking about the removal of the main line through the city , which was tying up traffic in the city during station stops . This , however , was not implemented during the 1950s , as proposed . Instead , the Erie reconstructed the stations at Passaic and Clifton . Third , the New Jersey State Highway Department needed rights @-@ of @-@ way for Interstate 80 through Paterson and State Route 21 through Passaic ( right where Passaic Park station and BE Drawbridge were located ) . 
 After the merge on October 17 , 1960 , between the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western and the Erie , the city officials in Passaic once again brought back the possibility of removing the tracks through Main Street , Passaic . This time , the newly formed Erie – Lackawanna went forward with it , beginning the process to move its main line onto the former Boonton Branch and Newark Branch through Lyndhurst , Passaic and Clifton . The main line was abandoned past Carlton Hill , and BE Drawbridge was swung in the open position , and soon put up for sale price of $ 0 @.@ 00 in 1964 by the mayor of Passaic . 
 After the abandonment of the Erie Railroad 's main line through the city of Passaic , the two @-@ tracked stub from Rutherford and Bergen Junction westward through Carlton Hill remained in service as the Carlton Hill Branch . This alignment received most of the deadhead trains , but there was a limited set of Carlton Hill – Rutherford – Hoboken trains , making only those two stops . In October 1966 , along with the Newark Branch and the spur of the New York & Greenwood Lake to Wanaque , the Carlton Hill Branch service was discontinued and the station no longer received passenger trains . The station building was later demolished , and only the tracks and asphalt platform remain to this date at Jackson Avenue . The company retains ownership .

 Resident Evil is a 2002 science fiction horror film written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson . The film stars Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez . It is the first installment in the Resident Evil film series , which is loosely based on the Capcom survival horror video game series Resident Evil . 
 Borrowing elements from the video games Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2 , the film follows amnesiac heroine Alice and a band of Umbrella Corporation commandos as they attempt to contain the outbreak of the T @-@ virus at a secret underground facility . The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed more than $ 102 million worldwide . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Underneath Raccoon City exists a genetic research facility called the Hive , owned by the Umbrella Corporation . A thief steals the genetically engineered T @-@ virus and contaminates the Hive with it . In response , the facility 's artificial intelligence , the Red Queen , seals the Hive and kills everyone inside . 
 Alice ( Milla Jovovich ) awakens in a deserted mansion with amnesia . She dresses and checks the mansion , and is subdued by an unknown person . A group of commandos breaks into the mansion and arrests the person who introduces himself as Matt Addison ( Eric Mabius ) ; Addison has just transferred as a cop in Raccoon P.D. The commandos explain that everyone in the group , except Matt , is an employee of the Umbrella Corporation , and Alice and her partner Spence ( James Purefoy ) are guards for a Hive entrance under the disguise of a couple living in the mansion . Five hours prior , the Red Queen had shut down the entire facility and released amnesia @-@ inducing gas . The commando team does not know why the Red Queen sealed the facility . The group travels to the underground train under the mansion that leads to the Hive , where they find Spence . They start the train and travel into the facility . 
 They reach the Queen 's chamber , but it is protected by a laser defense system that kills four of the commandos , including the leader , One ( Colin Salmon ) . Despite the Red Queen 's urgent pleas for the group to leave , Kaplan ( Martin <unk> ) disables the Red Queen and the power fails , opening all of the doors in the Hive . This releases the zombified staff and containment units containing Lickers ( mutated animals ) . During a battle with the zombies , Rain ( Michelle Rodriguez ) is bitten , and J.D. ( Pasquale <unk> ) perishes . Alice begins regaining her memories , but Matt and Alice are separated from the group . Matt looks for information about his sister Lisa , while Alice encounters several infected Dobermans and surprises herself when she reflexively defends herself with martial arts . 
 Matt finds his sister zombified . Alice saves him , and Matt explains that he and Lisa were environmental activists . Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out evidence of illegal experiments . Alice remembers she was Lisa 's contact in the Hive and was intending to bring down Umbrella , but does not tell Matt . The survivors reunite at the Queen 's chamber . The commandos explain that they have one hour before the Hive will seal automatically , trapping them inside . Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen in order to find an exit and rig the Red Queen 's circuit breaker , so they can shut her down remotely to force her cooperation . As they escape through maintenance tunnels , they are ambushed by zombies , including a reanimated J.D. who bites Rain , who had been bitten twice beforehand . When J.D. tries to attack , Rain kills him . The group manages to get to safety , but Kaplan is bitten and separated from them . 
 Alice remembers that an anti @-@ virus is in the lab , but when they arrive it is missing . Spence regains his memory , realizing he stole and released the virus . He hid the T @-@ virus and anti @-@ virus on the train . Spence is bitten by a zombie , which he kills before trapping the survivors in the lab , then he heads to the train . He retrieves the anti @-@ virus , but is ambushed and killed by a Licker as the survivors watch on a security monitor . The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain , whose health is fading and who has been infected too long for the anti @-@ virus to work reliably . As the Licker attempts to reach them , Rain tells Alice to kill her . Alice refuses , then a power outage occurs . The lab door opens to reveal Kaplan , who disabled the Red Queen to open the door . They reach the train , where Alice dispatches a zombified Spence and takes the anti @-@ virus . 
 On the train , they inject Rain and Kaplan with the anti @-@ virus . However , the Licker is hiding on the train and attacks them , clawing Matt . The Licker then grabs Kaplan and hurls him from the train . Alice and Matt battle the Licker . Rain turns into a zombie and attacks Matt , but he kills her . They open a trapdoor , dropping the Licker under the train , killing it . Matt and Alice escape the Hive as the containment doors close . 
 At the mansion , Matt 's wound begins mutating . Before Alice can give him the anti @-@ virus , the mansion doors burst open , and a group of Umbrella scientists and commandos seizes them . They subdue Alice and take Matt away , revealing he is to be put into the Nemesis Program , and they intend to re @-@ open the Hive . Alice attempts to fight them off but is knocked unconscious . 
 Some time later , Alice awakens at the Raccoon City Hospital strapped to an examination table , with no memory of what happened since her capture . After escaping , she goes outside to find Raccoon City abandoned and ruined . A newspaper clipping shows that the T @-@ virus spread to the surface after Umbrella reopened the Hive , creating an army of undead which devastated the city . Alice arms herself with a shotgun from an abandoned police car .

 In 1999 , Sony and Capcom greenlit a Resident Evil film with George A. Romero signed on as the film 's director and screenplay writer . Romero 's association with Capcom , the Resident Evil video game series creators , had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an ad campaign for Biohazard 2 ( Resident Evil 2 ) in Japan . Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studio 's Talk City chatroom that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource . Romero 's screenplay was based on the first Resident Evil game and included characters from the video games . Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were the lead characters , involved in a romantic relationship . Barry Burton , Rebecca Chambers , Ada Wong , and Albert Wesker were to also appear . The ending to the film would have been similar to that of the best ending to the first Resident Evil game . Romero 's script was disapproved of and production was placed into development hell . Capcom producer Yoshiki Okamoto explained to the editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly that " Romero 's script wasn 't good , so Romero was fired " . In February 2000 , Romero revealed in an interview with DGA magazine that " I don 't think they were into the spirit of the video game and wanted to make it more of a war movie , something heavier than I thought it should be . So I think they just never liked my script . " As Romero 's script was a close , but not full , adaptation of the game , Capcom believed fans would feel that the film had been altered too much from the game and that newcomers would dislike the premise . 
 Hired by Sony , Paul W. S. Anderson wrote a screenplay , which was ultimately favored over Romero 's . In late 2000 , Anderson was announced as director and writer , and Resident Evil re @-@ entered pre @-@ production stages . Anderson stated the film would not include any tie @-@ ins with the video game series as " under @-@ performing movie tie @-@ ins are too common and Resident Evil , of all games , deserved a good celluloid representation " .

 In early 2001 , Michelle Rodriguez , James Purefoy and Milla Jovovich were the first of the cast to be signed on the project . David Boreanaz was intended to portray the male cop lead of Matt Addison ; however , he turned down the role to continue work on the WB series Angel . Boreanaz suggested that he was in negotiations to have a smaller role in the film , claiming " Resident Evil is still there , a possibility , So , yeah , I 'll see what happens " , but he later declined the role . The role of Matt Addison then went to Eric Mabius who was cast in March 2001 , along with Heike <unk> , who was cast as Matt Addison 's sister Lisa Addison , an employee working for Umbrella 's Hive facility . 
 = = = Production and story development = = = 
 In early March 2001 , it was announced that half of the film would be shot in <unk> Studios in Berlin and its surroundings . Principal photography began on March 5 , 2001 at numerous locations including the then unfinished station U @-@ Bahnhof Bundestag of the Berlin U @-@ Bahn , <unk> Allee , Kaserne <unk> and the Schloss <unk> . 
 The film 's score and soundtrack were composed by Clint Mansell , Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson during mid @-@ 2001 . Manson described the score and soundtrack as being more " electronic " than his other previous work . 
 The film was originally subtitled as " Resident Evil : Ground Zero " when the movie was considered a prequel to the games , however the subtitle was removed due to the 9 / 11 attacks . The film 's first plot as of March 16 , 2001 revealed that Jovovich 's Alice and Rodriguez 's Rain were the leaders of a commando team sent in to prevent a viral outbreak from spreading to the rest of the world . The character of the Red Queen 's character was added into the film 's story as an homage to HAL 9000 from 2001 : A Space Odyssey . 
 During production , professional dancers were hired to star as zombies as they had better control of their body movements . While computer effects were used on some zombies , much of the undead appearances were accomplished through make @-@ up while their movements were a more laissez @-@ faire approach , as Anderson told the actors to move however they thought a zombie would , given their conditions . Whilst filming , there was a shortage of manpower where the available dancers were not enough to represent the required numbers of undead , however some of Capcom 's executives and several of the film producers including Jeremy Bolt agreed to make appearances . The film 's stunt coordinator also made an appearance as the dog trainer while Bolt 's girlfriend and sister both appeared as zombies .
