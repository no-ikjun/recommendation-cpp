 Papoose remixed the song and performed a freestyle over it . Papoose released a music video of his version of the song . Rappers Tinie Tempah , Chipmunk , Wretch 32 , and Jadakiss with Styles P of The LOX also released a remix and freestyle . Rapper The Game used some of this song 's content to record a diss track named " Uncle Otis " , referring to Otis Redding 's vocal sample on the track . He insulted Jay @-@ Z and Kanye West along with musicians Big Sean , Kreayshawn amongst others . The Game however has gone on record , saying that " It ’ s poking jokes and taking shots , but that ’ s what I do " and that song wasn 't serious in nature . Writing about the song , Pop Crush commented that " an obvious attempt to get some promotion for his upcoming disc , The R.E.D. Album . Later Game used the " Otis " instrumental for a twenty @-@ minute freestyle entitled " Daytona 500 ( 500 Bars ) . " Cassidy did his . Rappers DMX and Busta Rhymes also made a collaborative " Otis " remix . Singer Ne @-@ Yo also recorded a freestyle rap over " Otis " for a mixtape .

 The music video was directed by Spike Jonze and was filmed in Downey , California , USA . Pitchfork Media reported that " Jay @-@ Z and Kanye West are doing something big for the video for Otis . " The video , featuring a cameo by Aziz Ansari , was released on Thursday , August 2011 on MTV and affiliated networks at 8 : 56 pm ET / PT with an encore showing at 11 : 00 pm ET / PT on MTV2 . The video was uploaded on music video site VEVO on the same day . 
 The video primarily shows West and Jay @-@ Z destroying and then customizing a Maybach 57 and then racing around an industrial lot in it ( with no doors or windows ) , while four models smile and laugh from the backseat . The " dynamic duo take a saber saw to a glistening new Maybach and turn it into a tricked @-@ out ' Thunderdome ' cruiser , then do doughnuts in a parking lot with a gaggle of models packed in the back . " The video " eschews the narrative <unk> and stoner @-@ boggling tricks of previous Jonze videos " preferring instead to " luxuriate in the icon status of its two principals . We get fireworks , fist bumps , a fast car , and general larger @-@ than @-@ life camaraderie rather than , say , guys on fire running in slow @-@ motion . It 's like The Expendables , if that movie only starred two guys , and both of them were rappers who didn 't do any onscreen fighting . " The car was put up for auction , and the proceeds donated toward the East African Drought Disaster . 
 Pitchfork Media named the video amongst the best of the year . As of January 2015 , Billboard named the video as one of the 20 best of the 2010s ( so far ) .

 = Hurricane Maria ( 2005 ) = 
 Hurricane Maria was a hurricane which formed in September 2005 during the annual hurricane season . Maria was the thirteenth named storm , sixth hurricane , and fourth major hurricane of the record @-@ breaking season . Hurricane Maria formed in the central Atlantic on September 1 and tracked to the northwest , strengthening as it moved over warm waters . The storm reached its peak strength on September 5 east of Bermuda and gradually weakened before becoming extratropical on September 10 . Hurricane Maria did not affect any land as a tropical system , but it brought tropical storm @-@ force winds to Iceland as an extratropical cyclone and produced heavy rain and three fatalities in Norway . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A powerful tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 27 . As it moved west into the Atlantic , it became more organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about midway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles on September 1 . Shear from an upper @-@ level low to the southwest slowed the development of the storm and caused uncertainties in the National Hurricane Center 's forecasts , as some models indicated that the depression would dissipate and others that it would become a hurricane . The depression gradually strengthened as it moved to the northwest across the open Atlantic Ocean , becoming Tropical Storm Maria on September 2 and reaching hurricane strength on September 4 . 
 In the central Atlantic , Hurricane Maria continued to strengthen in favorable conditions , and on September 5 briefly became a Category 3 hurricane with 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) winds while 480 miles ( 770 km ) east of Bermuda . Increasing shear and cooler waters caused the storm to rapidly weaken to a minimal hurricane on September 7 . Operationally , the NHC believed that Maria had briefly weakened further into a tropical storm , but post @-@ season analysis confirmed this did not occur . 
 As Hurricane Maria moved to the northeast the official forecasts called for the storm to continue to weaken slowly but an interaction with an upper @-@ level trough caused Maria to strengthen again . It was also predicted that the storm would rapidly become extratropical , but Maria retained tropical characteristics for 48 hours longer than some forecasts indicated . Maria weakened into a tropical storm on September 9 before finally becoming extratropical about midway between the Azores and Newfoundland early on September 10 . 
 The extratropical system intensified considerably , achieving hurricane intensity once again on September 11 at about 52 ° N , with a minimum pressure of 962 mbar ( hPa ) — equal to its minimum pressure as a tropical cyclone . It passed just to the south of Iceland on September 13 as a hurricane @-@ strength extratropical system ( although the center stayed offshore ) . As the storm approached Norway on September 14 it merged with another strong extratropical system . 
 = = Impact and records = = 
 While Maria remained far from the U.S. East Coast , rip currents caused by the combined effects of the distant Maria and the closer Hurricane Nate ( which was near Bermuda at the time ) killed one person and seriously injured another in New Jersey . 
 Maria never approached any land areas while a tropical system , but tracked toward northern Europe after becoming an extratropical storm on September 10 . The first land effects were felt in Iceland on September 12 , where tropical storm @-@ force winds were reported . The strongest winds were recorded in Vestmannaeyjar where sustained winds in excess of 67 mph ( 107 km / h ) were reported as well as a minimum pressure of 979 mbar . The storm then brushed the northernmost part of Scotland , with no reported damage there either . The extratropical Maria merged with another system and this storm made landfall in Norway . This storm brought tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall to that country , and caused flooding and several mudslides , particularly around Bergen , the most important of which occurred in <unk> . One person was killed immediately , at least nine others were injured , and numerous homes were destroyed . Marine interests were also affected , as a large number of ferries were docked in the Baltic Sea . On September 18 , a woman died of injuries . Her daughter died on February 7 , 2006 , after having been kept alive in a respirator since the accident . After the storm , <unk> million ( 2005 NOK , $ 3 @.@ 1 million in 2005 USD ) in compensation was given for the damage . 
 When Maria developed on September 2 , it was the earliest ever in a season that the 13th named tropical storm developed , beating the previous record held by Hurricane Thirteen of the 1933 season by six days . 
 = 1985 Pacific typhoon season = 
 The 1985 Pacific typhoon season has no official bounds ; it ran year @-@ round in 1985 , but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean . Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center . Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA . This can often result in the same storm having two names . 
 A total of 29 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific , of which 28 became tropical storms . 17 storms reached typhoon intensity , of which one typhoon reached super typhoon strength . The strongest cyclone of the season , Dot , reached category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale to the east of the Philippines . Typhoon Cecil was the deadliest storm of the season , accounting for nearly half of the deaths from western Pacific tropical cyclones in 1985 . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 A total of 29 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific , of which 28 became tropical storms . 17 storms reached typhoon intensity , of which 1 reached super typhoon strength . Only four tropical cyclones moved through the Philippines this season , while eight moved into China , three moved into Vietnam , and three moved into Japan . Tropical cyclones brought Hong Kong 40 percent of its annual rainfall . The strongest cyclone of the season , Dot , reached category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . However , it weakened slightly before moving into the Philippines at the high end of category 3 status . Typhoon Cecil was the deadliest storm of the season , accounting for nearly half of the deaths from western Pacific tropical cyclones in 1985 .

 = = = Tropical Storm Elsie = = = 
 This was the first tropical cyclone to form in the northwest Pacific basin in January in six years . Forming along the near equatorial trough , two circulations formed on either side of Guam . Elsie formed from the eastern circulation , appearing southwest of Pohnpei on January 4 . On January 5 , further convective development occurred which formed a low level circulation on January 6 . Becoming a tropical depression late that day and a tropical storm on January 7 , the system moved northwest , reaching its peak intensity late in the day . Thereafter , strong southerly winds aloft arrested development , and weakening began . Tropical depression status was regained on January 8 , and its circulation dissipated early January 9 . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Fabian ( <unk> ) = = = 
 The initial tropical disturbance formed on the west end of the near @-@ equatorial , or monsoon , trough . Due to strong high pressure due its north , and the associated high winds associated with the northern Asian monsoon , strongest winds within the system were on its western periphery . Strong southerly winds aloft led to persistent vertical wind shear , which limited its intensification is it moved west to northwest . It passed nearby Yap , and caused crop damage as it passed by the island group . 
 = = = Tropical Depression = = = 
 A tropical depression formed 740 kilometres ( 460 mi ) east of Luzon on April 22 . Moving east @-@ northeast for a couple days , the system dissipated on April 24 770 kilometres ( 480 mi ) north @-@ northwest of Guam . 
 = = = Typhoon Gay ( <unk> ) = = = 
 Gay was the third tropical cyclone and first typhoon of the 1985 Pacific typhoon season . After over four months of inactivity , on May 16 , a strong atmospheric circulation formed 380 nmi ( 700 km ) west of Koror , now part of Palau . The circulation began to develop convection and by May 20 had organized into a depression . Heading north , the storm took two days to gain tropical storm strength , likely because a tropical upper tropospheric trough ( TUTT ) was so close to the north , restricting outflow . However , the trough soon weakened and outflow improved and the storm began to intensify faster . Gay became a typhoon early on May 23 , continuing to intensify , Gay came under influence of a frontal boundary to the northwest and began to recurve to the northeast , through a weakness in the subtropical ridge created by the trough associated with the frontal boundary . This trough began to build and dig southeastward , pouring fuel into Gay 's engine . Typhoon Gay reached its peak intensity of 100 knots ( 115 mph , 185 km / h ) on May 24 . As cool , dry air became entrained within Gay 's circulation , the cyclone began to weaken . Gay underwent extratropical transition as it interacted with the frontal boundary . Gay became extratropical shortly after weakening to a tropical storm early on May 26 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm 04W = = = 
 This system formed within the northern portion of the monsoon trough on June 16 . Strong northeast winds aloft kept its circulation center on the northeast side of its stronger thunderstorm activity . The system drifted generally northwest , making landfall on Hainan Island before dissipating . While never upgraded by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center , the Japanese Meteorological Agency considered the system a weak tropical storm , 
 = = = Typhoon Hal ( Kuring ) = = = 
 Typhoon Hal , which formed on June 19 east of the Philippines , passed just north of Luzon on the 22nd as a 95 mph ( 153 km / h ) typhoon . After briefly weakening Hal restrengthened to a peak of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) before weakening back to a minimal typhoon . Sustained winds reached 48 knots ( 89 km / h ) at Lan Yu , Taiwan . The 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) typhoon hit 75 nautical miles ( 139 km ) east @-@ southeast of Hong Kong in southeastern China on the 24th , and dissipated the next day . In Hong Kong , winds peaked at 74 knots ( 137 km / h ) at Kwai Chung , and a total of 285 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 11 @.@ 24 in ) fell at Tate 's Cairn which led to landslides across the region . Heavy rain associated with the typhoon caused 38 deaths ( with 14 missing ) and widespread crop and structural damage . Damage totalled US $ 12 @.@ 3 million ( 1985 dollars ) . 
 = = = Typhoon Irma ( <unk> ) = = = 
 First noted southwest of Ponape on June 17 , the tropical disturbance moved westward for the next several days without significant development . As it turned northwest on June 25 , the system strengthened rapidly into a tropical storm , reaching typhoon intensity on June 27 as it turned more poleward . The system recurved just offshore the southern islands of Japan before striking southwest of Tokyo , Japan as a typhoon on July 1 . Weakening as it accelerated northeast , Irma regained tropical storm intensity later that day and became an extratropical cyclone that night . As Irma passed to the east of the Philippines the system enhanced the Monsoon Trough causing heavy rains over Luzon Island . A total of 46 people were killed and 1 @,@ 500 homes were destroyed . In Japan Irma killed 3 people and left 5 missing . Over 20 @,@ 000 houses were damaged and 50 @,@ 000 hectares of farmland were ruined . Damage across the Philippines and Japan totalled US $ 80 million ( 1985 dollars ) .

 A tropical depression formed 1 @,@ 050 kilometres ( 650 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Manila on July 4 . Moving west @-@ northwest , the system crossed the central Philippines on July 5 , moving into the South China sea on July 6 . Moving more towards the north on July 7 , the depression moved inland into southern China east of Hong Kong on July 8 . In Hong Kong , winds gusted to 47 knots ( 87 km / h ) at Tate 's Cairn , where 114 @.@ 1 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 49 in ) fell . While Hong Kong considered it a tropical depression throughout its life cycle , PAGASA named the system and considered it a tropical storm . 
 = = = Typhoon Jeff ( Goring ) = = = 
 The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression in northwest of Guam on July 21 . It tracked northward , becoming a tropical storm on the 22nd and reaching its first peak of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) winds on the 23rd . An upper level trough outran the system , forcing Jeff westward into a shearing environment and weakening it to a depression on the 26th . The shear abated , and Jeff was able to restrengthen , becoming a storm on the 27th and a typhoon on the 29th . The 85 mph ( 137 km / h ) typhoon hit eastern China on the 30th . It brought the heaviest rain to Shanghai since 1962 . Jeff weakened rapidly to a depression , but upon reaching the Yellow Sea , it again restrengthened to a tropical storm on the 1st . Jeff reached a third peak of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) winds before becoming extratropical on the 2nd . A total of 245 people were killed from this storm , with moderate to heavy damage to crops . 
 = = = Typhoon Kit = = = 
 Typhoon Kit was the first of seven tropical cyclones to form in the West Pacific in August . It formed from a disturbance at the north end of a monsoon trough . The disturbance quickly gained organization and formed into a tropical depression on August 2 . The storm moved steadily to the northwest and steadily intensified . The depression became Tropical Storm Kit on August 4 . The storm became a typhoon as it made a temporary jog to the north before continuing its northwest motion . The typhoon , small in size , reached its peak intensity of 85 knots ( 90 mph , 157 km / h ) while south of Kyūshū on August 8 . Kit recurved in the East China Sea in the face of an approaching trough which caused a weakness in the subtropical ridge . Kit made landfall on the south @-@ western tip of South Korea as a weak typhoon . The storm killed twelve people from resultant flooding and caused significant property damage on Cheju Island and the southern coast of South Korea . Kit became an extratropical cyclone in the Sea of Japan . A total of US $ 3 @.@ 7 million ( 1985 dollars ) of damage were caused by Kit across South Korea and Japan . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Lee ( Huling ) = = = 
 Lee formed within the monsoon trough , and was initially influenced by Kit to its north . Kit 's movement to the north reoriented the trough into a more north @-@ south orientation , and a broad circulation formed 890 km south of Okinawa . Moving north @-@ northeast , convection around the system began to organize into a more consolidated tropical storm . The system turned northwest , but development was halted by northerly vertical wind shear . Its circulation center remained fairly broad while it continued to deepen , more like a monsoon depression than a tropical cyclone . As the system passed close to Okinawa , winds remained fairly light . However , winds increased as it pulled away , due to the pressure gradient / strongest winds being well removed from the center . Continuing to move north into a break in the subtropical ridge , Lee moved through the East China Sea to about 445 km west of Kyūshū and stayed about 220 km offshore the western Korean peninsula . By this time , the system was evolving into a more typical tropical cyclone , with stronger winds closer to the center . Accelerating across the Yellow Sea on August 14 , Lee began to recurve across North Korea and subsequently weakened rapidly across the mountainous terrain . A total of US $ 3 @.@ 9 million ( 1985 dollars ) in damage was caused by Lee . 
 = = = Typhoon Mamie = = = 
 On August 15 , a tropical depression formed from the monsoon trough a short distance of northern Taiwan . It headed northeastward , becoming a tropical storm later that day . The building of the subtropical ridge to its east forced Mamie northwestward , where it became a typhoon on August 17 . On August 18 , the typhoon hit near Shanghai , China , and paralleled the east coast of China . The storm turned to the northeast , hit near Dairen , China , and dissipated on August 20 . Mamie was responsible for 44 fatalities and heavy crop damage . Total damage amounted to US $ 13 @.@ 7 million ( 1985 dollars ) . 
 = = = Typhoon Nelson ( Ibiang ) = = = 
 Typhoon Nelson , which developed on August 16 , moved northwest until reaching typhoon intensity , when a blocking ridge turned the system more to the west . The cyclone brushed northern Taiwan on August 23 as a 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) typhoon . Later that day , it made landfall on eastern China before dissipating on August 24 . Nelson caused 55 deaths and heavy damage across eastern China . In addition , the remnants of the storm stalled over the area , killing an additional 147 people . 
 = = = Typhoon Odessa = = = 
 Typhoon Odessa was a tropical system that was active from August 23 through the 1st of September in the Western Pacific Ocean . Odessa was one of three tropical cyclones to exist in the area of Japan at around the same time . Odessa and Pat would pass very close together with Ruby impacting Tokyo . Odessa formed from an area of disturbed weather that persisted on the eastern end of a monsoon trough . The disturbance organized into a depression on August 23 and continued to develop and it was a tropical storm before the day was over . Odessa assumed a northerly track as it continued to strengthen , reaching typhoon intensity late on October 24 . Odessa had become a compact storm with a very symmetrical structure . Its eye was very well defined , despite its peak intensity of 90 knots ( 100 mph , 165 km / h ) . Odessa was observed by STS 51 as they passed overhead . Odessa was one of the most powerful , circular tropical cyclone patterns ever seen by spacecraft crew . After moving westward and stalling southwest of Japan , it turned the northeast , travelling along the south @-@ western coast of Japan , weakening along the way , before becoming extratropical on September 1 . 
 = = = Typhoon Pat ( Luming ) = = = 
 Typhoon Pat developed from the Monsoon Trough situated to the east of Taiwan on August 27 . Pat quickly was upgraded to tropical storm status and was named . Due to a probable Fujiwara Interaction between Pat and Typhoon Odessa , Pat moved toward the northeast . Just before making a turn towards the northwest Pat was upgraded to a typhoon on the 28th . Typhoon Pat began to accelerate in the direction of Japan . Pat made landfall on southern Kyūshū on the 30th before accelerating through the Sea of Japan and turning extratropical . Pat killed 23 people through Kyūshū and Hokkaidō and destroyed 3 @,@ 000 homes . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Ruby = = = 
 Forming east of Odessa and Pat , the initial disturbance developed near a location with an upper level low interacted with the monsoon trough . The low pressure area formed on August 25 to the south @-@ southeast of Okinawa , moving around the southern periphery of Odessa and Pat . Thunderstorm activity concentrated near its low level center , and the system rapidly moved through the tropical depression stage into the tropical storm stage on August 26 , developing an elliptical eye . Vertical wind shear from Odessa kept Ruby from becoming a typhoon . Weaving its way northward , Ruby moved across Tokyo early on August 31 as it lost its central convection . Later that day , the system evolved into an extratropical cyclone . Six perished due to Ruby . Damage totalled US $ 14 million ( 1985 dollars ) from Odessa , Pat , and Ruby . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Skip = = = 
 The initial tropical disturbance formed well south of Hawaii along the near @-@ equatorial trough on August 28 , moving briskly to the west . The system developed into Tropical Depression Two @-@ C on August 30 and crossed the dateline the next day . It strengthened into a tropical storm and typhoon while moving northwest . It briefly threatened Wake Island as a typhoon before a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough ( TUTT ) recurved Skip off to the northeast . It then recrossed the date line as a tropical storm . Skip became an extratropical cyclone on September 8 as it turned to the north and northeast . 
 = = = Typhoon Tess ( Miling ) = = = 
 On August 28 , a tropical disturbance formed south of Guam . On September 1 , the system strengthened into a tropical depression and then tropical storm . Throughout its lifetime , Tess moved generally to the west @-@ northwest . On September 3 , Tess became a typhoon just before moving across Luzon , with four perishing from the resultant floods . A tornado was spawned by the system in <unk> . Briefly dropping to tropical storm strength , the cyclone turned to the west upon entering the South China Sea . On September 5 , Tess strengthened into a typhoon while moving northwest towards China and Hong Kong . Winds gusted to 65 knots ( 120 km / h ) at Hong Kong 's international airport and 88 knots ( 163 km / h ) at Green Island . Tate 's Cairn measured 204 @.@ 4 millimetres ( 8 @.@ 05 in ) of rainfall . Flooding and crop damage was reported across southern China near where Tess moved inland and dissipated . One perished in the Philippines , and two in Hong Kong . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Val ( Narsing ) = = = 
 The initial tropical disturbance formed west of Truk / Chuuk within the monsoon trough , and moved northwestward . After developing into a tropical depression early on September 15 , the system moved around a west @-@ north @-@ westerly course , becoming a tropical storm on September 15 . As Val passed south of Naha , the system turned more westward blocked by the subtropical ridge and passed south of Taiwan , which caused its center to become ill defined . The resultant tropical depression moved inland into southeast China on September 18 . Winds remained below tropical storm force in Hong Kong , and rainfall amounts were light . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Winona = = = 
 The initial disturbance formed within the South China sea along the monsoon trough on September 18 . Moving northwest , the system developed into a tropical depression on September 19 and a tropical storm on early on September 21 . Turning more to the north , Winona missed Hainan Island to the east , and moved into southern China west of Hong Kong on September 22 , before quickly dissipating early on September 23 . Floods across southeast China trapped 57 @,@ 000 people , and at least 7500 homes were damaged .

 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Andy = = = 
 The initial tropical disturbance formed across the Philippine Sea within the monsoon trough on September 25 , moving westward across Luzon on September 26 . As it moved across the South China Sea , a surge in the northeast flow helped the system develop into a tropical depression on September 27 before strengthening into a tropical storm on September 28 . Typhoon intensity was reached on September 29 , and its center moved along the south coast of Hainan Island where winds gusted to 80 knots ( 150 km / h ) . The storm continued south of due west across the Gulf of Tonkin into Vietnam late on October 1 , killing 46 people across central portions of the country . The weakening cyclone crossed central Laos before dissipating in northeast Thailand on October 2 . 
 = = = Typhoon Brenda ( Pining ) = = = 
 A tropical disturbance was tracked south of Ponape in late September before consolidating into a tropical depression on the 29th to the east of the Philippines . The depression moved towards the west and was named Tropical Storm Brenda on the 30th and became a typhoon the same day . Brenda then completed a small cyclonic loop on 1 October before turning towards the northwest and strengthening to a peak of 105 mph ( 169 km / h ) . Brenda turned more northerly and skimmed the southern coast of South Korea before turning extratropical in the Sea of Japan . Nearly 12 inches ( 300 mm ) of rain fell on the South Korean Peninsula heavy flooding on Cheju Island and near Pusan killed 14 people and left 43 missing . The damage from the system totalled US $ 10 million ( 1985 dollars ) .

 The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression over the open West Pacific on October 11 . It headed west @-@ northwestward , strengthening to a tropical storm on the 13th and a typhoon on the 14th . Dot rapidly intensified to a 175 mph ( 282 km / h ) Super Typhoon on the 16th , the only one of the year , and steadily weakened until hitting eastern Luzon as a 130 mph ( 210 km / h ) typhoon on the 18th . It crossed the South China Sea and hit southern Hainan Island . In Hong Kong , winds gusted to 61 knots ( 113 km / h ) at Tate 's Cairn , but rainfall amounts were light as the system mainly bypassed the protectorate to the south . Dot made its final landfall on northern Vietnam on the 21st as a 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) tropical storm . Dot caused 101 fatalities and 2 @.@ 13 billion Philippine Pesos ( 1987 pesos ) in damage , or US $ 103 @.@ 6 million ( 1987 dollars ) . 
 = = = Typhoon Cecil ( Rubing ) = = = 
 An area of convection organized into a tropical depression on October 12 in the southeastern South China Sea . It tracked to the west @-@ northwest , becoming a tropical storm later that day and a typhoon on the 13th . Cecil continued to intensify , and reached a peak of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) winds before hitting north @-@ central Vietnam and dissipating on the 16th . Torrential flooding and wind damage to the area caused 702 casualties , with widespread structural and crop damage . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Ellis = = = 
 The initial disturbance formed west of Kosrae on October 13 , moving west @-@ northwest . Slow to organize , the system evolved into a tropical depression on October 16 and a tropical storm late that day . Soon afterwards , Ellis turned westward and slowed due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge to its north caused by a system passing well to the north of Ellis . The storm turned southwest on October 17 due to the building in of a stronger high pressure system to its northwest . By October 20 , Ellis weakened into a tropical depression while resuming a westward course as it passed under an upper level low which increased vertical wind shear and disrupted its associated thunderstorm activity . The cyclone turned west @-@ northwest on October 21 for a couple days before dissipating east of the Philippines . 
 = = = Typhoon Faye ( Tasing ) = = = 
 The initial tropical disturbance formed in the South China sea , and was swept eastward through the Philippines due to Dot 's movement to its north . The system emerged east of the Philippines and developed into a tropical depression and tropical storm on October 23 . Turning northwest , Faye crossed central Luzon on October 24 , weakening back into a tropical depression . Back in the South China sea , Faye regained tropical storm strength . The cyclone made a small cyclonic loop between October 25 and October 26 as a system over China approached Faye from the northwest . The tropical cyclone accelerated east @-@ northwest , passing just north of Luzon . By October 28 , Faye 's motion slowed and the system strengthened into a typhoon early on October 29 . After passing Okinawa , strong westerly winds aloft caused the typhoon to begin to weaken . Early on November 1 , Faye weakened into a tropical storm before it evolved into an extratropical cyclone later that day . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Gordon = = = 
 The initial disturbance formed in the southern South China sea and moved eastward . Its initial intensification to a tropical storm was caused by a surge in the northeast flow to its north and west , and the system turned to the north . As the cyclone became warm core , Gordon was able to restrengthen into a tropical storm after the monsoon wind surge slackened . Throughout its life cycle , thunderstorm activity was removed to the northwest of Gordon 's low level circulation . Soon after becoming a tropical storm again , Gordon turned to the west @-@ northwest and made landfall in Vietnam .

 = Leprechaun ( film ) = 
 Leprechaun is a 1993 American horror comedy film written and directed by Mark Jones . It stars Warwick Davis in the title role and Jennifer Aniston in her film debut . Davis plays a vengeful leprechaun who believes a family has stolen his pot of gold . As he hunts them , they attempt to locate his gold to mollify him . The film was originally meant to be more of a straight horror film , but Davis injected humor into his role . Re @-@ shoots also added increased gore to appeal to older audiences . 
 It was the first film produced in @-@ house by Trimark to be theatrically released and grossed $ 8 @.@ 6 million in North America against a budget of less than $ 1 million . Reviews on release were negative and focused on the film 's acting , humor , and directing , all of which were criticized ; it has also been called Aniston 's worst film . It is the first entry in the Leprechaun horror film series and was followed by five sequels and a remake . Leprechaun is often broadcast on St. Patrick 's Day .

 Ten years later , J. D. Redding and his teenage daughter Tory rent the O 'Grady farmhouse for the summer . Contract workers Nathan Murphy , his 14 @-@ year @-@ old brother Alex , and their dimwitted friend Ozzie Jones help re @-@ paint the farmhouse .

After failing to convince the others that he met a leprechaun , Ozzie spots a rainbow and chases it , believing he will find a pot of gold at the end . Alex accompanies him for fear Ozzie might hurt himself . A bag of one hundred gold pieces magically appears before Ozzie . After Ozzie tests the gold and accidentally swallows a piece , they stash it in an old well and plot to keep it for themselves , hoping to fix Ozzie 's brain . 
 At the farm , the leprechaun lures J. D. into a trap by imitating a cat , biting and injuring his hand . Tory and the others rush him to the hospital , and the leprechaun follows on a tricycle . Alex and Ozzie visit a pawn shop to see if the gold is pure , and the leprechaun kills several townspeople .

 Mark Jones , the writer @-@ director , had a career in American television shows . Desiring to make a film , he decided that a low budget horror film was his best opportunity . Jones was inspired by the Lucky Charms commercials to create a leprechaun character , only his twist was to turn the character into an antagonist . Jones was further influenced by the film Critters , which featured a small antagonist . Jones brought the concept to Trimark , who were looking to get into film production and distribution . Leprechaun became the first film produced in @-@ house by Trimark to be theatrically released . Entertainment Weekly quoted the budget at " just under $ 1 million " . Warwick Davis , who had experienced a dry spell after playing the protagonist in Willow , liked the script and was excited to play against type . Jennifer Aniston , who was an unknown at the time , impressed Jones , and he fought to have her cast . 
 Shooting occurred over three weeks , beginning at Valencia Studios , where Terminator 2 : Judgment Day had recently finished production . Several violent scenes were filmed at Big Sky Ranch , where Little House on the Prairie and The Waltons were shot . Davis later said it felt " a little blasphemous " . Davis performed most of his own stunts . For the scene where Davis chases Aniston in a wheelchair , Aniston had to run in slow motion so that Davis could keep up with her , as he had trouble manipulating the wheels . The film was initially more of a straightforward horror film , but Davis sought to add more comedic elements . Jones agreed with this tonal shift , and they shot it as a horror comedy . Several scenes had to be re @-@ shot after the producers insisted that the film be made <unk> to appeal to older audiences . 
 Gabe Bartalos performed the make @-@ up effects . Trimark contacted Bartalos to produce a sample . Bartalos 's early efforts were not to his liking , and he pushed the design in a more grotesque direction , as that was what he wanted to see on the screen as a horror fan . Bartalos 's design impressed Trimark , and he got the account . Applying the make @-@ up took three hours , and taking it off took another 40 minutes . Davis described the experience as " not a pleasant sensation " . To pass the time while the make @-@ up was being applied , Davis said he had bizarre conversations with Bartalos , with whom he got along well . Davis was conscious of the need to stay relaxed and not move , and he channelled his confidence that the make @-@ up effects were properly applied into his acting .

 Leading up to the film 's release , Trimark engaged in an aggressive marketing campaign , partnering with the National Basketball Association , American Stock Exchange , and , after failing to secure deals with either corporate headquarters , individual franchisees of Domino 's Pizza and Subway . Leprechaun opened on January 8 , 1993 , in 620 theatres and took in $ 2 @,@ 493 @,@ 020 its opening week , ultimately earning $ 8 @,@ 556 @,@ 940 in the United States . <unk> released it on VHS in April 1993 , and it sold over 100 @,@ 000 copies . The film score was released on March 9 , 1993 , by Intrada Records . The film was released on DVD in August 1998 . Lionsgate released a triple feature collection on March 11 , 2008 .

 On release , critical reception for the film was negative . Writing for The Deseret News , Chris Hicks said that the film should have been released direct @-@ to @-@ video . Also criticizing Trimark 's release of the film , The Austin Chronicle 's Marc Savlov called it cliched , uninteresting , and an " utter waste of perfectly good Kodak film stock " . Internet @-@ based critic James Berardinelli called it " unwatchable " and not even enjoyably bad , and Matt <unk> of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the film " has brought new meaning to the term ' bad ' " . At the Los Angeles Daily News , Robert Strauss called it " as witless and worthless a horror film as could possibly be conjured " . Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette critic Ron Weiskind called the film incompetent and criticized the film 's acting , lack of suspense , and production values . Weiskind concluded , " Forget about the proverbial pot of gold . The movie Leprechaun is a crock . " 
 Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times called the cast " the usual all @-@ formula grab @-@ bag " , and The Washington Post 's Richard Harrington said the human actors are all bland . Berardinelli described the characters as " a group of morons who act like they flunked kindergarten " but said Aniston " might be competent " in a better film . Weiskind instead called Aniston 's character a " Beverly Hills brat " who audiences will want to die . Of Davis , Harrington wrote that he " imbues a weak character with a strong presence " , saying the film is only interesting while Davis is on @-@ screen . Harrington concludes that the film is notable only for Davis ' performance . Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the leprechaun " no more than dangerously cranky " and reminiscent of Chucky from Child 's Play ; Hicks also described the leprechaun as similar to Chucky . Wilmington wrote that while a killer Leprechaun logically follows a trend of gimmicky antagonists , it is still a bad idea . 
 Of the film 's humor , Wilmington wrote that Leprechaun " isn 't dumb enough to be fun " . Hicks described the film 's humor as " ill @-@ advised slapstick " , and Canby wrote that it is " neither scary nor funny " . Berardinelli called the leprechaun 's one @-@ liners " more idiotic than pithy " . Writing in the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , critic Jeff Makos unfavorably compared the film 's tone to that of Tremors , which he posited as an influence . Makos said Davis does his best to be funny , but the film has no funny jokes , making audience feedback probably more entertaining than the film itself . The use of Lucky Charms as humor also received commentary . Harrington wrote that Jones is " so bereft of inventive ideas that he refers to Lucky Charms cereal not once but three times " , and <unk> criticized the Lucky Charms jokes as unfunny . 
 Berardinelli said director Mark Jones has no style evident in the film . Wilmington described it as a " dingy , drab , pointless little movie ... made without flair or imagination , seemingly enervated by its own bad taste and low intentions " . Canby called the screenplay and direction amateurish , and Hicks wrote that Jones is bereft of ideas and should go back to his day job , describing the plot as " by @-@ the @-@ numbers killings with no rhyme or reason " . Harrington wrote that the film " has major continuity and credibility problems " . Strauss identified the theme as anti @-@ greed but said the writing is " simultaneously prosaic and murky " , causing Jones to miss his mark . Wilmington wrote that the leprechaun 's cries for his gold reflects the filmmakers ' cynical desire for box office success . Sight & Sound described Leprechaun as a film which seems to have no concept of a target audience , stating , " Jones wants this to be a lively romp for older kids in the mould of Time Bandits ... but also wants to corner the lucrative horror market . " The review concluded , " Unsuitable for adults or kids , this is ultimately for completists . " Harrington called the make @-@ up " quite evil @-@ looking " , though Strauss wrote that " effects are strictly so @-@ so " . 
 Rotten Tomatoes , a review aggregator , reports that 23 % of 13 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review ; the average rating is 4 / 10 . A 2014 retrospective from Entertainment Weekly identified it as Aniston 's worst role to date , and Aniston herself has expressed embarrassment over the film . In 2009 , Tanya Gold of The Guardian selected it as one of her ten favorite scary films to watch on Halloween . 
 = Alphonse Alley = 
 Alphonse Amadou Alley ( April 9 , 1930 – March 28 , 1987 ) was a <unk> army officer and political figure . He was most active when his country was known as Dahomey . He was born in Bassila , central Dahomey , and enrolled in schools in Togo , Cote d 'Ivoire , and Senegal before enlisting in the French army in 1950 . He saw combat in Indochina from 1950 to 1953 , in Morocco from 1955 to 1956 , and in Algeria from 1959 to 1961 . After the coup in 1965 , President Christophe Soglo promoted Alley Chief of Staff of the Army . Young army officer Maurice Kouandété was appointed Alley 's chef de cabinet in 1967 . 
 Kouandété launched another coup against Soglo on December 17 , but he was forced to hand power to Alley two days later . His administration oversaw the creation of a new constitution and a presidential election , Dahomey 's first since 1964 . The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three @-@ quarters of the country from voting . Alley lost popularity with the suggestion that the military should retreat back to the barracks , and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété . On July 17 , 1968 , Alley was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou , a veteran politician . 
 Alley 's retirement was marked by a series of discharges from the military , trials , and prison sentences . At one trial , Zinsou 's conduct sparked another coup led by Kouandété . On October 26 , 1972 , Mathieu Kérékou seized power in a coup . He ended Alley 's military career , as well as that of every other senior officer , and named Alley commissioner of the National Oil Wells ( <unk> ) , a role with very little responsibility . Kérékou accused Alley of plotting against him on February 28 , 1973 , and sentenced the latter to 20 years in prison . He died on March 28 , 1987 . 
 = = Military background = = 
 Alley was born on April 9 , 1930 , in Bassila , central Dahomey . He was a member of the small <unk> ethnic group , based in the north . His father was also a military commander , who served the French in Syria during 1942 and helped train police in Togo . Alphonse enrolled in schools in Togo , Cote d 'Ivoire , and Senegal until he enlisted in the French army in 1950 . His first combat operation later that year was at the Indochinese Peninsula for the First Indochina War . Alley withdrew in late 1953 , shortly before Operation Castor was launched at Dien Bien Phu . After this wartime experience , he went the Saint <unk> Officer School in France . He saw combat in Morocco from 1955 to 1956 and in Algeria from 1959 to 1961 , where he became a paratrooper . 
 After Dahomey gained independence in 1960 , Alley travelled back to his homeland and led a paratrooper unit . At first , he was a lieutenant , but he was promoted to captain in 1962 and major in 1964 . Later that year he led several soldiers to the Dahomey @-@ Niger border during a border dispute . Historian Samuel Decalo described Alley as " a jovial , dashing , easygoing and well @-@ liked figure " and was known by diplomats as " the wine , women and song officer " . 
 In Dahomeyan coups in 1963 and 1965 , Alley urged General Christophe Soglo to seize power . After the 1965 coup , Soglo promoted Alley Chief of Staff of the Army . Alley made known his disagreements with Soglo on several occasions , though he remained loyal nonetheless . Young army officer Maurice Kouandété was appointed Alley 's chef de cabinet in 1967 and his frequent opposition to Alley during staff meetings helped to create factions in the Dahomeyan Army . 
 = = 1967 coup d 'état = = 
 Kouandété had aspirations of his own . On December 17 , 1967 , he and 60 other soldiers led a military coup and toppled Soglo . Kouandété seized the presidency , though he was unsure what to do with it . Members of his faction urged the new president to remain at his post , though the general public 's opinion was against him . Meanwhile , France refused to aid Dahomey and would not recognise Kouandété . He was forced to appointed Alley provisional president two days later , although Kouandété had placed Alley under house arrest and accused him of " shirking [ his ] duties " and maintained a " policy of appeasement . " Kouandété served as prime minister thereafter . 
 = = President of Dahomey = = 
 Alley was one of the few figures who were trusted by northern and southern <unk> alike . His role was only temporary , until power was to be ceded back to civilians in six months time . Among the events on the official timetable , which the military published on January 17 , 1968 , was the creation of a nonmilitary Constitution Commission on January 31 , which would write a new Dahomeyan constitution . The document granted Alley strong executive power , and was adopted by the Comite Militaire <unk> , Alley 's interim government <unk> only military officers , in early March . A national referendum on the constitution was held on March 31 , which passed with 92 percent in favor . 
 The Comite decided to ban all former presidents , vice presidents , government ministers , and National Assembly presidents from the upcoming presidential election . This was to prevent Dahomeyan politics from repeating its practices of old . The Supreme Court ruled the proscription was unconstitutional , although Alley overruled the decision . He instead only recognised five candidates as legitimate . 
 In response to their disqualification , former presidents Hubert Maga and Sourou @-@ Migan Apithy staged protests while Justin Ahomadégbé @-@ Tomêtin , another ex @-@ president , supported an obscure candidate named Basile <unk> <unk> . The election was held on May 15 , and was Dahomey 's first since 1964 . <unk> won the election with 80 percent of the vote , but Alley declared the result void because the protest prevented nearly three @-@ quarters of the electorate from voting . This result sparked further demonstrations , and Maga , Apithy , Ahomadégbé @-@ Tomêtin , and former president Christophe Soglo were forbidden to enter the country , in an attempt to crack down on dissent . Alley felt he had made a mistake in disqualifying Maga , Apithy , and Ahomadégbé @-@ Tomêtin , as he believed that only they could bring unity to Dahomey . 
 In a radio address on May 11 , Alley announced that due to the nullification , the military would <unk> to stay in power beyond June 17 . He noted that his administration would require extra time to find a successor who was backed by everyone . Alley suggested that the military should retreat back to the barracks at Camp <unk> and leave Dahomeyan politics to the career politicians . The view was unpopular , and he was outvoted by his military comrades . Alley eventually became little more than Kouandété 's mouthpiece . 
 Alley attempted to remove Kouandété from the army , though to no avail . In any case , by June his fellow officers had made up their mind as to the next president . After talks with unionists , civil servants , and academics , they " entrust [ ed ] the reins of power to Émile <unk> Zinsou for at least five years " , who was " charged to form a government of national union " , as per a June 28 newspaper article by the state press . On July 17 , Alley handed power to Zinsou , a veteran politician . 
 = = Later life = = 
 After Alley was retired from the presidency , he was purged from combat in the army and was assigned the new post of military attaché in Washington , D.C , an appointment he refused to accept . General Etienne <unk> , the president of neighboring Togo , thought that this " serve [ d Alley ] right , for being stupid enough to give power back to the politicians . Don 't think I 'm ever going to be that dumb . " Alley was discharged from the armed forces altogether in September , with Kouandété taking his place as Chief of Staff . 
 On July 11 , 1969 , Kouandété accused Alley of plotting to kidnap and murder him . Facing the death penalty , Alley was sentenced to ten years of hard labor at an open trial held on October 4 . Zinsou had intervened for Alley , and it strained relations between the president and Kouandété . The latter decided to lead another coup on December 10 . In the aftermath , Alley was released from incarceration and reinstated in the army . In July 1968 , he was named Secretary General of National Defence . Kouandété ended up becoming Alley 's adjutant . 
 In 1971 , Alley allowed <unk> refugee Noe <unk> protection in Dahomey , despite official government policy to the contrary . On October 26 , 1972 , Mathieu Kérékou seized power in a coup . He ended Alley 's military career , as well as that of every other senior officer , and named him commissioner of the National Oil Wells ( <unk> ) , a role with very little responsibility . Kérékou accused Alley of plotting against him on February 28 , 1973 , and sentenced him to 20 years in prison . He was released on amnesty on August 1 , 1984 , as well as all other political detainees besides those involved in the " ignoble and barbarous imperialist armed aggression of Sunday , January 16 , 1967 , " as the official press release states . 
 Alley died on March 28 , 1987 . He was survived by his son , Zacharie . Plans for a mausoleum are in the works , decades after his death .

 The effects of Hurricane Charley in North Carolina were minor to moderate and included $ 25 million ( 2004 USD ) in damage . Hurricane Charley lasted from August 9 to August 15 , 2004 , and at peak intensity it attained 150 miles per hour ( 240 km / h ) winds , making it a strong Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . The storm made landfall in southwestern Florida at maximum strength , and moved northward , parallel to the U.S. East Coast before moving ashore on northeastern South Carolina . 
 The storm caused flooding in seven counties within the state as a result of 5 @.@ 05 inches ( 128 mm ) of rainfall . Winds peaked at 85 miles per hour ( 137 km / h ) which downed trees and power lines , and left 65 @,@ 000 homes without power . A storm surge of 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) was reported , along with moderate waves that caused minor beach erosion . No deaths are attributed to the storm .

 On August 13 , 2004 , a tropical storm watch was issued for Cape Fear , southward to South Carolina . The watch was extended northward to Oregon Inlet later that day ; the watch further extended to Chincoteague , Virginia . The tropical storm watch from Cape Lookout to Oregon Inlet was changed to a hurricane warning . A hurricane watch was subsequently put into effect for coastal areas from Oregon Inlet to the North Carolina / Virginia border , although by August 15 all advisories were discontinued . Flood watches were also placed into effect for portions of the state . 
 Governor Mike Easley declared a state of emergency in advance of the storm , and 200 National Guard troops were dispatched to Charlotte , Raleigh , Kinston and <unk> , while 800 more were on standby . On Ocracoke Island , authorities ordered mandatory evacuations , while on Bogue Banks voluntary evacuations were in place . Officials in Wrightsville Beach drove along the streets with loudspeakers mounted on trucks , warning tourists that a storm was approaching . The storm forced the University of North Carolina at Wilmington to suspend a planned opening for students moving in to residence halls . Campgrounds at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore were closed by the National Park Service and three boat ramps were closed . Duke Power Co. prepared for Charley by lowering the level of hydroelectric lakes to make room for excessive rainfall . The state Department of Environment and Natural Resources advised hog farmers to pump out their waste lagoon . About 60 Red Cross shelters were opened during the storm and during the peak of Charley , and roughly 1 @,@ 600 people sought protection .

 Hurricane Charley produced moderate to heavy rainfall over the state , peaking at 5 @.@ 05 inches ( 128 mm ) near Greenville ; other rainfall amounts ranged from less than 1 inch ( 25 mm ) – more than 4 inches ( 100 mm ) . The outer rainbands began affecting the region in the early hours of August 14 . Due to widespread debris , storm drains became clogged which left flooding in some areas . Freshwater flooding was reported in seven counties along the coastal plain . State highways 42 and 581 , as well as numerous county and local roads , were covered with at least 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) of water . Wilmington and surrounding towns were forced to close a total of 20 streets . The heavy precipitation also caused the Neuse River to swell to flood stage . A few businesses throughout the region were damaged ; two in downtown Greenville and five others were flooded . 
 The storm produced estimated storm surge of 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) , along with waves of up to 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) in height . However , there were isolated reports of 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) surge , particularly along the beaches of Brunswick County . This produced minor beach erosion along the coastline . Winds gusted from 60 – 70 miles per hour ( 95 – 110 km / h ) , causing minor wind damage . The hurricane spawned five weak tornadoes across the state , including an F1 in Nags Head that damaged twenty structures . Charley destroyed 40 houses and damaged 2 @,@ 231 , 231 severely , including 221 damaged beach homes in Sunset Beach . Damage was the greatest in Brunswick County , where wind gusts peaked at 85 miles per hour ( 137 km / h ) . The winds blew down chimneys and damaged a roof on one building , and ripped the siding off another . Crop damage was also heavy in Brunswick County , with 50 % of the tobacco crop lost and 30 % of the corn and vegetable fields destroyed . Strong winds downed trees and power lines , leaving 65 @,@ 000 homes without power . Damage in North Carolina totaled to $ 25 million ( 2004 USD ) .

 State Highway 151 , or SH 151 , also known as the Raymond E. <unk> Jr . Freeway is a 10 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 17 @.@ 2 km ) state highway in the U.S. state of Texas that runs from Loop 1604 to U.S. Highway 90 ( US 90 ) in San Antonio . SH 151 is a limited @-@ access freeway for its entire length with the exception of its junction with Loop 1604 at its western terminus where a traffic light controls the junction . The routing of the freeway was first conceived in 1983 and construction was conducted in phases through the 1980s and 1990s until completion in 2004 . The freeway provides access to the western part of San Antonio , the SeaWorld San Antonio theme park , Chase , Northwest Vista College , and the future site of a Microsoft data center . 
 = = History = = 
 The route of Highway 151 was originally conceived in 1983 by local land developer Charles Martin Wender and later received approval by Raymond <unk> , the district supervisor of the Texas Department of Transportation at the time and for whom the freeway would later be named . The freeway was a joint effort with landowners providing 85 % of the right @-@ of @-@ way worth US $ 26 million and half of the cost of the frontage roads worth $ 14 million with the city buying the rest . During the construction of the freeway , the Texas Turnpike Authority considered SH 151 as a candidate to become a toll road , but this drew much criticism from local politicians and the Bexar County commissioners and did not come to fruition . 
 The freeway was built in phases with the frontage roads constructed first followed by the main lanes . The overpasses for Wiseman Boulevard , Westover Hills Boulevard and Military Drive between I @-@ 410 and Loop 1604 were completed over the main lanes of SH 151 in 1987 . In 1988 , the I @-@ 410 overpasses over the SH 151 frontage roads were completed , as was the interchange with US 90 at the eastern terminus . Also completed in 1988 were the frontage road bridges over Leon and Slick Ranch Creek , which enabled traffic to travel the entire corridor from Loop 1604 to US 90 by way of the frontage roads . The main lane overpasses at FM 1957 ( Potranco Road ) and Ingram Road were completed in 1997 . The overpasses at Pinn Road and Enrique M. Barrera Parkway were completed in 1998 , and completed at Callaghan Road in 2000 . Construction of the freeway was completed in 2004 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SH 151 begins at Loop 1604 , the outer loop around San Antonio , on the west side of San Antonio and from there follows a southeastern path through the western part of the city . The highway provides access to the SeaWorld San Antonio theme park as well as industry along its corridor to include Chase , Hyatt Hill Country Resort , World Savings , Philips semiconductor , the National Security Agency campus , QVC , American Funds , Maxim Integrated Products , and the Northwest Vista College , as well as the nearby Southwest Research Institute . Microsoft has also selected the corridor for a $ 550 million data center . The highway continues to the southeast to a junction with Interstate 410 ( I @-@ 410 ) , the inner loop around San Antonio .

 Danebod ( pronounced " <unk> @-@ a @-@ bo " , or " DAN @-@ a @-@ bo " ) is a historic district at the south edge of the railway town of Tyler in southwestern Minnesota . Founded in 1885 by Danish Evangelical Lutherans led by Rev. Hans Jørgen Pedersen ( 1851 – 1905 ) , the district comprises a group of buildings dating back to 1888 from Minnesota 's oldest Danish immigrant settlement . Danebod remains until this day a predominantly Danish Lutheran , close @-@ knit religious community . An annual celebration named Æbleskiver Days , held on the fourth weekend of July , celebrates Danish heritage and culture and includes a parade that goes down the town 's main street with floats that are made by the various Danebod neighborhoods . 
 On the basis of its cultural and architectural significance , four buildings from Danebod were added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 30 , 1975 as the " Danebod Historic Complex " . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name " Danebod " honors Denmark 's first queen , Queen Thyra Danebod , the consort of tenth @-@ century Danish king Gorm the Old . Queen Thyra is thought to have directed the building of a stone wall across the Danish peninsula of Jutland as protection against foes to the south , and in gratitude she was given the name Danebod . The name Danebod originally meant in Danish " one who mends , comforts , or saves the Danes " .

 The native inhabitants of the area which later became Danebod were the Dakota Sioux people . 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 On September 8 , 1872 , two Danish pioneer pastors , Adam Dan and Rasmus Andersen , established a small organization in <unk> , Wisconsin , which later became the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America . At one of the churches ' conventions in Clinton , Iowa , in 1884 , the Danish farmer Rasmus Hansen of Elk Horn , Iowa , suggested that " the Danish Church should help all the families living around in cities , who would prefer living in the countryside , where they could find a fitting spot for a Danish colony . " A committee was appointed for the purpose of finding a piece of land for the scattered Danish immigrants to settle . The committee consisted of the <unk> Evangelical @-@ Lutheran pastors F. L. Grundtvig ( the son of N. F. S. Grundtvig ) , Kristian Anker , Rasmus Hansen , Jens C. Kjær , and C. <unk> . This committee soon made arrangements with Winona and the St. Peter Railroad Company to purchase 35 @,@ 000 acres ( 140 km2 ) of land in the southeastern part of Lincoln County , Minnesota . An agreement with the land agent , A. <unk> , stipulated that for three years this land was to be sold only to Danish people . The land was rolling prairie by the hills of Buffalo Ridge , just south of the community of Tyler , Minnesota . By June 27 , 1885 , seventy settlers from various states , towns , and communities had made the area their home . 
 The pioneer settlers were all Grundtvigians ; a faction within the Danish National Church . The Grundtvigians represented a nationalistic and liberal religious tradition , in staunch contrast to <unk> and fundamentalists in the Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark . Grundtvigians believed in celebrating life , but they lived for the present , and were often nicknamed " Happy Danes " . While salvation was the gift of Christianity , being saved was not a focus . The Bible was the Holy Book , but was not to be taken literally , and the Apostles ' Creed rather than the Bible was their source of Christianity . Grundtvigians were also nationalists who wanted to " <unk> the Danes in appreciation of their identity " , and its founder , Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig , is quoted for his writing : " first a Dane and then a Christian " in 1848 . The Grundtvigians stressed four elects of a " true people " : a common land , a common language , a common history and forefathers , and common culture through songs , folk dancing , language , cuisine , etc . Grundtvigians established Danebod to " save the Danes from total Americanization " , and the colony 's only written and spoken language remained Danish for several decades after its establishment . On Sunday , June 28 , 1885 , the pioneers arranged a festival to celebrate the new colony . The population grew rapidly in the early 1890s , and by the year 1895 , 222 people lived in the Danish Colony of Danebod . 
 = = = Late 19th century = = = 
 On July 11 , 1886 , a meeting was held at the home of P. N. Clausen at which the Danebod congregation was formally organized with fifteen members . The church council consisted of its president , P. N. Clausen , secretary M. Lauritsen , and treasurer Jørgen Jacobsen . At first there were no regular church services and no resident pastor . Instead , the people met in various homes to sing Danish hymns and listen to a reading of the sermon by a layman . The pastor of Sleepy Eye , Minnesota , S. C. Madsen , and other ministers occasionally conducted services in town . The congregation later hired the Danish settler , pastor Hans Jørgen Pedersen ( 1851 – 1905 ) of Gowen , Michigan . He arrived with his family on April 12 , 1888 . Pedersen had a humble upbringing in Denmark , where he later studied at <unk> Folk High School before emigrating to America in 1875 . He was an eloquent preacher , resourceful , and became involved in community activities throughout the area . He quickly assumed leadership and thus , in a sense , became the founder of Danebod . One of the pastor 's six children , Sigurd Pedersen , described their first arrival in Danebod in his autobiography : " It was a chilly morning , when the committee stood on the platform to bid welcome to the new pastor and his wife , trailed by six children , and the rear held up by the trusty hired man , Søren Olsen , who was to keep count of the straying flock and see that the last luggage was not forgotten . Friends invited us over for breakfast in the home of H. J. Nelsen , the merchant . Then the committee guided us to a small house on the corner just west of the present @-@ day Chevrolet dealer , where businessman Carl Cold Sorensen brought the first automobiles to the area in the early 1900 's . The committee had left no kindling in this small house , but Søren Olsen soon discovered that the kitchen range was in place and claimed to be able to manipulate the same if kindling could be provided . Across the street was a large general store , and father sent us there to beg Mr. Lauritsen for some kindling . We were given old boxes to break up , and we soon had our arms full and Søren had a blazing fire in a few minutes . " In September 1888 , it was decided at a convention in Elk Horn , Iowa , to give the congregation at Danebod 77 acres ( 0 @.@ 31 km2 ) of land , and the Danebod Lutheran Church was dedicated on Sunday , June 16 , 1895 . Pedersen died in 1905 , and the Reverend Thorvald Knudsen succeeded him at Danebod . 
 Pastor H. J. Pedersen , like most early pastors in the synod , had received his training in a folk school , and he was convinced that the success of the new congregation and colony depended on the establishment of such a Danish @-@ speaking folk school . Danebod Folk School opened December 1 , 1888 , with Pedersen as president . Other teachers were Carl Hansen and Christian Hansen . Among the first students were Niels Petersen and Kristian Klink , both Danish immigrants . Klink was a stonemason educated in Denmark , and he helped pastor Pedersen in building the Stone Hall . It was built of native rock . Farmers hauled rocks from the shores of Swan Lake just south of Danebod , and Klink and his helpers split and shaped the rocks . The Stone Hall was finished in the fall of 1889 , and the first public gathering in the Stone Hall was at Klink 's funeral in November 1889 . The Stone Hall quickly became the center of the new colony , and Sunday services were conducted here , as well as numerous weddings , baptisms and funerals . The students at the Danebod Folk School used the building as a gym hall , and young people would meet here to socialize , meet up with friends , and participate in singing games . Three years later , the Stone Hall was now too small for worship services . It was decided to build a new church , and the Cross Church at Danebod was dedicated on Sunday , June 16 , 1895 . 
 = = = Early 20th century = = = 
 A Ladies ' Aid society was established on July 15 , 1903 , with board members Marie <unk> , Anna P. C. Petersen , Henrietta Hansen , and Sine C. Jensen . At first , Sunday school was conducted an hour prior to the church services on Sunday , but in 1907 it was decided to hold Sunday school during the time of worship service . As early as 1904 , the synod had discussed the possibility of establishing a children 's home at Tyler . On November 1 , 1906 , a children 's home opened in the residence of K. H. <unk> , who temporarily moved to <unk> , Minnesota . A Folk School Association was organized in 1912 . As early as 1888 , the colony organized its first Danish elementary school for its children , <unk> , which was in use until 1939 . In her travel diary entitled My Big Adventure of 1915 – 1916 : The joys and hazards of motor touring in 1915 , Danebod local Ragna C. Olson ( 1905 – 2007 ) described the average school day in 1914 : " We had an hour of religion , then learned how to read and write Danish , some history , and the last hour we girls learned work such as knitting , crocheting and embroidery . In the afternoons , they taught us English , writing , reading and arithmetic . " Ragna Olsen ( previously Sorensen ) was the daughter of the Danish pioneers Johanne Marie Sorensen ( 1877 – 1947 ) and Carl Cold Sorensen ( 1879 – 1967 ) , both of whom hold a place in Danebod history for bringing the first motorized vehicles to Tyler in the early 1900s . 
 On Sunday , February 25 , 1917 , Danebod Folk School burned to the grown . Fortunately , the fire burned slowly . The students and the quickly summoned neighbors had time to rescue much of the furniture and other items of high value . Nearby buildings were saved , but the Folk School was beyond rescue . In the fall of 1917 , nine months after the disastrous fire , a new and larger Folk School was dedicated . Speakers at the dedicatory exercises were Pastor Knudsen , C. P. <unk> , Aage Møller , P. Rasmussen , and Kristian Østergaard . Meanwhile , a terrible epidemic of influenza swept the county , and all churches and schools were temporarily closed in an effort to halt the deadly disease ; but many people died . Another catastrophe followed on August 21 , 1918 , when a devastating tornado tore through Lincoln County . It was the fourth most deadly tornado in Minnesota history and took the lives of 36 people and injured a dozen more . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Danebod has continued to be a haven for Danish culture through the 20th century and into the 21st . The elementary school , university , library , newspapers , and church services remained Danish language for decades ( and remained the most widely spoken language until the 1940s ) . Danebod remains a predominantly Danish @-@ American town . It is customary to fly the Danish flag , Dannebrog , and Danish cuisine , music , cultural celebrations , language , literature , and the Evangelical Lutheran religious tradition remain important parts of life for the more than 200 inhabitants . Until 1947 church services were held solely in the Danish language , but has since offered one weekly service in Danish . Danebod is sometimes referred to as " the home of the <unk> , " a reference to the mythological <unk> of folklore . There is a sign on Tyler Street saying : " Welcome to Tyler . Home of the <unk> " . 
 During the 1930s , a combination of financial pressure and low enrollment forced the Danish @-@ language based Danebod Folk School to close down . The building was re @-@ opened in 1946 and has since 1947 offered annual summer family camps . Danebod Folk Camp offers Danish cuisine , Danish folk dance , Danish art , and other Danish cultural experiences . In the spirit of the Danish Folk School system , camp attendees sing Danish songs , dance traditional Danish folk dance , work on crafts and have Danish @-@ based lectures throughout the day . 
 There are several annual Danish @-@ inspired celebrations in town , including the town parade , <unk> ( Danish Constitution Day ) , <unk> , and Æbleskiver Days . Æbleskiver are traditional Danish pancakes in a distinctive spherical shape . Æbleskiver Days is one of the town 's top attractions , and has been held annually by Danish descendants for more than a hundred years . During this two @-@ day festival held on the 4th weekend of every July , Danebod celebrates its Danish heritage and community . During this festival , there is a parade inspired by Danish traditions and culture that goes down Main Street with floats made by the various neighborhoods . Traditional Danish foods such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , cream wafers , cinnamon sticks , rosettes , kisses , as well as <unk> , smørrebrød , Danish coffee , liver @-@ pâté , and sweets are also popular during the festival . Other activities during Æbleskiver Days include traditional Danish folk dancing , Danish art displays , Danish folk song singing , children 's activities , and the fairground fair called Tivoli The Scandinavian tradition of singing and dancing around the Christmas tree still takes place at the center of the Gym Hall during Christmas time . Some families keep up the tradition of celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 . There is a town fair on the Danish Constitution Day , June 5 . There are still quite a few Danish speakers , especially among the elders . 
 = = Danebod Historic Complex = = 
 Recognized for its architectural and cultural significance , the Danebod Historic Complex , at 101 Danebod Court , was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 30 , 1975 . The complex includes four historic buildings : the Folk School ( built in 1888 , rebuilt in 1917 ) , Stone Hall ( 1889 ) , Cross Church or Danebod Lutheran Church ( 1893 ) , and Gym Hall ( 1904 ) . Most of these buildings survived the disastrous fire of 1917 , except for the Folk School , which burned down and was rebuilt the same year . These buildings also stood through the devastating 1918 tornado , which killed 36 people in the community . 
 All four structures were built in a simplified Greek Cross floor plan to signify a religious purpose . Closest to Lake Danebod stands the Folk High School , a three @-@ story wooden building with eight gables . Next to the Folk High School stands the multipurpose Stone Hall , and across the street stands the Gym Hall with its iconic twin towers . Danebod Lutheran Church is located on the town 's main street , appropriately named Tyler Street , and is in the shape of a Greek cross on the outside . 
 The Danebod Lutheran Church ( also known as the Cross Church at Danebod ) was dedicated Sunday , June 16 , 1895 . It is a cruciform clapboard building with a square placed obliquely in the center . The tower in the middle is carried at a 45 degree angle to the arms of the cross . The outside and interior detailing of the church is Eastlake . It was built largely with volunteer labor and money pledged by the early settlers , who had little to give . Points of interest include the altar chairs , kerosene lamps , architectural structure , wainscoting walls and ceiling , porthole windows as in a ship , hand @-@ carving on the altar , pulpit and railing , the candelabra and altar cloth , hand @-@ carved stone baptismal font , the Star of Bethlehem in the ceiling , Bertel Thorvaldsen 's statue of Christ , the Celtic cross , and pictures in the narthex . The church is located at 101 Danebod Court . The church was established by the organization that later became the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ( <unk> ) . This organization later merged into the Lutheran Church in America ( LCA ) in 1962 and then into the largest Lutheran church in the U.S. in 1988 : the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ( ELCA ) . Danebod Lutheran Church remains a part of the ELCA still today . 
 The Danebod Stone Hall was built in 1889 and is a single @-@ floor stone building in the form of a Latin cross . Its entrance wing features medieval @-@ inspired crenellations , but the rest of the building with its pedimented windows are closer to being Greek Revival . It was built from native field rock hauled in by farmers and split and shaped by a Danish stonemason named Kristian Klink . The Stone Hall was used as the first church , later as a gymnasium and assembly hall . Points of interest are the outdoor old bell from the former children 's school , fresco from the Gym Hall , the old chandelier from the Cross Church , old photographs , and <unk> field stone in the structure . The Stone Hall is now a museum housing a collection of photographs , publications and objects important in Danebod history . It is also a venue for activities , lectures and discussion groups , and is typically open for public viewing during the Danebod Family Camp sessions . 
 The Danebod Gym Hall was erected in 1904 and is a cruciform clapboard building . The two sides of the entrance arm project forward to the eaves , and the sides plus a small roof enclose the entrance . It was originally built as a space for Danish gymnastics , folk dancing , music , theatrical performances , larger social gatherings , and worship for the Folk School students and other locals . Every year in the Gym Hall , the Danebod Lutheran Church upholds the Danish tradition of dancing around the Christmas tree . The basement is also commonly used for crafts such as stained glass and woodworking . In 1928 it was enlarged with a stage , basement and furnace . Many home talent plays were presented there , and it is still used for an occasional play , and is also used by the camps and retreats for folk dancing . Points of interest are the statue with an original canvas curtain with advertising , bars used years ago by gymnasts ( on the south wall ) , and the original wainscoting on the walls . 
 The Danebod Folk School was first built in the year 1888 , but it burned to the ground on February 25 , 1917 . It was soon rebuilt , and nine months later the current school building was completed . A three @-@ story brick building , it has gable ends carried up as parapets . The four @-@ story crenelated corner tower and the pointed arches at the entrance are from Gothic and native Danish architecture . The Folk School was renovated in 1946 and is now used by the Danebod Lutheran Church for camps and retreats , and as a meeting place for local groups and clubs . Points of interest are the hand @-@ carved podium in the lecture hall , the picture behind the podium , the hand @-@ carved wooden cross on the podium , collection plates made by Dr. Thomsen , and also the statuary in the lecture hall and sitting rooms , pictures in the sitting rooms , and the small podium in the dining room . Early settlers of the colony founded a residential school in the Danish tradition of folk High Schools and fostered the concept of " learning for living " , by which individuals sought to become enlightened and thoughtful citizens . The Folk School Building stands as a testament to these values , and continues to serve as a place for fellowship and lifelong learning . Each dormitory style room is unique in plan and decoration . A large kitchen and dining area provide a perfect setting for group meals and activities . A lecture hall and several classrooms allow ample space for programming . 
 = The Four Stages of Cruelty = 
 The Four Stages of Cruelty is a series of four printed engravings published by English artist William Hogarth in 1751 . Each print depicts a different stage in the life of the fictional Tom Nero . 
 Beginning with the torture of a dog as a child in the First stage of cruelty , Nero progresses to beating his horse as a man in the Second stage of cruelty , and then to robbery , seduction , and murder in Cruelty in perfection . Finally , in The reward of cruelty , he receives what Hogarth warns is the inevitable fate of those who start down the path Nero has followed : his body is taken from the gallows after his execution as a murderer and is mutilated by surgeons in the anatomical theatre . 
 The prints were intended as a form of moral instruction ; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London . Issued on cheap paper , the prints were destined for the lower classes . The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is <unk> by the funny touches common in Hogarth 's other works , but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience . Nevertheless , the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth . 
 = = History = = 
 In common with other prints by Hogarth , such as Beer Street and Gin Lane , The Four Stages of Cruelty was issued as a warning against immoral behaviour , showing the easy path from childish thug to convicted criminal . His aim was to correct " that barbarous treatment of animals , the very sight of which renders the streets of our metropolis so distressing to every feeling mind " . Hogarth loved animals , picturing himself with his pug in a self @-@ portrait , and marking the graves of his dogs and birds at his home in Chiswick . 
 Hogarth deliberately portrayed the subjects of the engravings with little subtlety since he meant the prints to be understood by " men of the lowest rank " when seen on the walls of workshops or taverns . The images themselves , as with Beer Street and Gin Lane , were roughly drawn , lacking the finer lines of some of his other works . Fine engraving and delicate artwork would have rendered the prints too expensive for the intended audience , and Hogarth also believed a bold stroke could portray the passions of the subjects just as well as fine lines , noting that " neither great correctness of drawing or fine engraving were at all necessary " . 
 To ensure that the prints were priced within reach of the intended audience , Hogarth originally commissioned the block @-@ cutter J. Bell to produce the four designs as woodcuts . This proved more expensive than expected , so only the last two of the four images were cut and were not issued commercially at the time . Instead , Hogarth proceeded to create the engravings himself and announced the publication of the prints , along with that of Beer Street and Gin Lane , in the London Evening Post over three days from 14 – 16 February 1751 . The prints themselves were published on 21 February 1751 and each was accompanied by a moralising commentary , written by the Rev. James Townley , a friend of Hogarth 's . As with earlier engravings , such as Industry and Idleness , individual prints were sold on " ordinary " paper for 1s . ( one shilling , equating to about £ 7 @.@ 10 in 2016 terms ) , cheap enough to be purchased by the lower classes as a means of moral instruction . " Fine " versions were also available on " superior " paper for 1s . 6d . ( one shilling and sixpence , about £ 10 @.@ 60 in 2016 terms ) for collectors . 
 Variations on plates III and IV exist from Bell 's original woodcuts , bearing the earlier date of 1 January 1750 , and were reprinted in 1790 by John Boydell , but examples from either of the woodcut printings are uncommon . 
 = = Prints = = 
 = = = First stage of cruelty = = = 
 In the first print Hogarth introduces Tom Nero , whose surname may have been inspired by the Roman Emperor of the same name or a contraction of " No hero " . Conspicuous in the centre of the plate , he is shown being assisted by other boys to insert an arrow into a dog 's rectum , a torture apparently inspired by a devil punishing a sinner in Jacques Callot 's Temptation of St. Anthony . An initialled badge on the shoulder of his light @-@ hued and ragged coat shows him to be a pupil of the charity school of the parish of St Giles . Hogarth used this notorious slum area as the background for many of his works including Gin Lane and Noon , part of the Four Times of the Day series . A more tender @-@ hearted boy , perhaps the dog 's owner , pleads with Nero to stop tormenting the frightened animal , even offering food in an attempt to appease him . This boy supposedly represents a young George III . His appearance is deliberately more pleasing than the scowling ugly ruffians that populate the rest of the picture , made clear in the text at the bottom of the scene : 
 The other boys carry out equally barbaric acts : the two boys at the top of the steps are burning the eyes out of a bird with a hot needle heated by the link @-@ boy 's torch ; the boys in the foreground are throwing at a cock ( perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the French , and a suggestion that the action takes place on Shrove Tuesday , the traditional day for cock @-@ shying ) ; another boy ties a bone to a dog 's tail — tempting , but out of reach ; a pair of fighting cats are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys ; in the bottom left @-@ hand corner a dog is set on a cat ; and in the rear of the picture another cat tied to two bladders is thrown from a high window . In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate , Tom Nero 's name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows ; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom . The absence of parish officers who should be controlling the boys is an intentional rebuke on Hogarth 's part ; he agreed with Henry Fielding that one of the causes for the rising crime rate was the lack of care from the overseers of the poor , who were too often interested in the posts only for the social status and monetary rewards they could bring . 
 Below the text the authorship is established : Designed by W. Hogarth , Published according to Act of Parliament . 1 Feb .. 1751 The Act of Parliament referred to is the Engraving Copyright Act 1734 . Many of Hogarth 's earlier works had been reproduced in great numbers without his authority or any payment of royalties , and he was keen to protect his artistic property , so had encouraged his friends in Parliament to pass a law to protect the rights of engravers . Hogarth had been so instrumental in pushing the Bill through Parliament that on passing it became known as the " Hogarth Act " . 
 = = = Second stage of cruelty = = = 
 In the second plate , the scene is <unk> Inn Gate ( sometimes ironically written as Thieves Inn Gate ) , one of the Inns of Chancery which housed associations of lawyers in London . Tom Nero has grown up and become a hackney coachman , and the recreational cruelty of the schoolboy has turned into the professional cruelty of a man at work . Tom 's horse , worn out from years of mistreatment and overloading , has collapsed , breaking its leg and upsetting the carriage . Disregarding the animal 's pain , Tom has beaten it so furiously that he has put its eye out . In a satirical aside , Hogarth shows four corpulent barristers struggling to climb out of the carriage in a ludicrous state . They are probably caricatures of eminent jurists , but Hogarth did not reveal the subjects ' names , and they have not been identified . Elsewhere in the scene , other acts of cruelty against animals take place : a drover beats a lamb to death , an ass is driven on by force despite being overloaded , and an enraged bull tosses one of its tormentors . Some of these acts are recounted in the moral accompanying the print : 
 The cruelty has also advanced to include abuse of people . A dray crushes a playing boy while the <unk> sleeps , oblivious to the boy 's injury and the beer spilling from his barrels . Posters in the background advertise a cockfight and a boxing match as further evidence of the brutal entertainments favoured by the subjects of the image . The boxing match is to take place at Broughton 's Amphitheatre , a notoriously tough venue established by the " father of pugilism " , Jack Broughton : a contemporary bill records that the contestants would fight with their left leg strapped to the floor , with the one with the fewest bleeding wounds being adjudged the victor . One of the advertised participants in the boxing match is James Field , who was hanged two weeks before the prints were issued and features again in the final image of the series ; the other participant is George " the Barber " Taylor , who had been champion of England but was defeated by Broughton and retired in 1750 . On Taylor 's death in 1757 , Hogarth produced a number of sketches of him wrestling Death , probably for his tomb . 
 According to Werner Busch , the composition alludes to Rembrandt 's painting , <unk> 's Ass ( 1626 ) . 
 In an echo of the first plate , there is but one person who shows concern for the welfare of the tormented horse . To the left of Nero , and almost unseen , a man notes down Nero 's hackney coach number to report him . 
 = = = Cruelty in perfection = = = 
 By the time of the third plate , Tom Nero has progressed from the mistreatment of animals to theft and murder . Having encouraged his pregnant lover , Ann Gill , to rob and leave her mistress , he murders the girl when she meets him . The murder is shown to be particularly brutal : her neck , wrist , and index finger are almost severed . Her <unk> box and the goods she had stolen lie on the ground beside her , and the index finger of her partially severed hand points to the words " God 's Revenge against Murder " written on a book that , along with the Book of Common Prayer , has fallen from the box . A woman searching Nero 's pockets uncovers pistols , a number of pocket watches — evidence of his having turned to highway robbery ( as Tom Idle did in Industry and Idleness ) , and a letter from Ann Gill which reads : 
 Dear Tommy 
 My mistress has been the best of women to me , and my conscience flies in my face as often as I think of <unk> her ; yet I am resolved to venture body and soul to do as you would have me , so do not fail to meet me as you said you would , for I will bring along with me all the things I can lay my hands on . So no more at present ; but I remain yours till death . 
 Ann Gill . 
 The spelling is perfect and while this is perhaps unrealistic , Hogarth deliberately avoids any chance of the scene becoming comical . A discarded envelope is addressed " To Thos Nero at <unk> ... " . Ronald Paulson sees a parallel between the lamb beaten to death in the Second Stage and the defenceless girl murdered here . Below the print , the text claims that Nero , if not repentant , is at least stunned by his actions : 
 Various features in the print are meant to intensify the feelings of dread : the murder takes place in a graveyard , said to be St Pancras but suggested by John Ireland to resemble Marylebone ; an owl and a bat fly around the scene ; the moon shines down on the crime ; the clock strikes one for the end of the witching hour . The composition of the image may allude to Anthony van Dyck 's The Arrest of Christ . A lone Good Samaritan appears again : among the snarling faces of Tom 's accusers , a single face looks to the heavens in pity . 
 In the alternative image for this stage , produced as a woodcut by Bell , Tom is shown with his hands free . There are also differences in the wording of the letter and some items , like the lantern and books , are larger and simpler while others , such as the man to the left of Tom and the topiary bush , have been removed . The owl has become a winged hourglass on the clock tower . 
 = = = The reward of cruelty = = = 
 Having been tried and found guilty of murder , Nero has now been hanged and his body taken for the ignominious process of public dissection . The year after the prints were issued , the Murder Act 1752 would ensure that the bodies of murderers could be delivered to the surgeons so they could be " dissected and <unk> " . It was hoped this further punishment on the body and denial of burial would act as a deterrent . At the time Hogarth made the engravings , this right was not enshrined in law , but the surgeons still removed bodies when they could . 
 A tattoo on his arm identifies Tom Nero , and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution . The <unk> , their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers , are shown to have as much feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims ; his eye is put out just as his horse 's was , and a dog feeds on his heart , taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one of its kind in the first plate . Nero 's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic , Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience . Just as his murdered mistress 's finger pointed to Nero 's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection , in this print Nero 's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display , indicating his ultimate fate . 
 While the surgeons working on the body are observed by the mortar @-@ boarded academics in the front row , the physicians , who can be identified by their wigs and canes , largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves . The president has been identified as John Freke , president of the Royal College of Surgeons at the time . Freke had been involved in the high @-@ profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter <unk> <unk> for dissection in 1749 . Aside from the over @-@ enthusiastic dissection of the body and the boiling of the bones in situ , the image portrays the procedure as it would have been carried out . 
 Two skeletons to the rear left and right of the print are labelled as James Field , a well @-@ known boxer who also featured on a poster in the second plate , and Macleane , an infamous highwayman . Both men were hanged shortly before the print was published ( Macleane in 1750 and Field in 1751 ) . The skeletons seemingly point to one another . Field 's name above the skeleton on the left may have been a last minute substitution for " <unk> <unk> " referring to Henry Simms , also known as Young Gentleman Harry . Simms was a robber who was executed in 1747 . The motif of the lone " good man " is carried through to this final plate , where one of the academics points at the skeleton of James Field , indicating the inevitable outcome for those who start down the path of cruelty . 
 The composition of the scene is a pastiche of the frontispiece of Andreas Vesalius 's De humani corporis fabrica , and it possibly also borrows from Quack Physicians ' Hall ( c . 1730 ) by the Dutch artist Egbert van Heemskerck , who had lived in England and whose work Hogarth admired . An earlier source of inspiration may have been a woodcut in the 1495 <unk> di <unk> by Johannes de <unk> which , although simpler , has many of the same elements , including the seated president flanked by two windows .

 Hogarth was pleased with the results . European Magazine reported that he commented to a bookseller from Cornhill ( a Mr. Sewell ) : 
 there is no part of my works of which I am so proud , and in which I now feel so happy , as in the series of The Four Stages of Cruelty because I believe the publication of theme has checked the diabolical spirit of barbarity to the brute creation which , I am sorry to say , was once so prevalent in this country . 
 In his unfinished Apology for Painters he commented further : 
 I had rather , if cruelty has been prevented by the four prints , be the maker of them than the [ Raphael ] cartoons , unless I lived in a Roman Catholic country . 
 In his 1817 book Shakespeare and His Times , Nathan Drake credits the representation of " throwing at cocks " in the first plate for changing public opinion about the practice , which was common at the time , and prompting magistrates to take a harder line on offenders . Others found the series less to their liking . Charles Lamb dismissed the series as mere caricature , not worthy to be included alongside Hogarth 's other work , but rather something produced as the result of a " wayward humour " outside of his normal habits . Art historian Allan Cunningham also had strong feelings about the series : 
 I wish it had never been painted . There is indeed great skill in the grouping , and profound knowledge of character ; but the whole effect is gross , brutal and revolting . A savage boy grows into a savage man , and concludes a career of cruelty and outrage by an atrocious murder , for which he is hanged and dissected . 
 The Anatomy Act 1832 ended the dissection of murderers , and most of the animal tortures depicted were outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 , so by the 1850s The Four Stages of Cruelty had come to be viewed as a somewhat historical series , though still one with the power to shock , a power it retains for a modern audience . 
 = Gill Sans = 
 Gill Sans is a sans @-@ serif typeface designed by Eric Gill and released by the British branch of Monotype from 1928 onwards . 
 Gill Sans takes inspiration from the calligrapher and lettering artist Edward Johnston ’ s 1916 " Underground Alphabet " , the corporate font of London Underground , now although not at the time mostly simply called the " Johnston " typeface . Gill as a young artist had assisted Johnston in its early development stages . In 1926 , Douglas Cleverdon , a young printer and later a BBC executive , opened a bookshop in Bristol , and Gill painted a fascia for the shop in sans @-@ serif capitals . In addition , Gill sketched an alphabet for Cleverdon as a guide for him to use for notices and announcements . By this time Gill had become a prominent stonemason , artist and creator of lettering in his own right and had begun to work on creating typeface designs . 
 Gill was commissioned to develop his design into a full metal type family by Stanley Morison , an influential Monotype executive and historian of printing . Morison hoped that it could be a competitor to a wave of German sans @-@ serif fonts in a new " geometric " style , which included <unk> , Futura and <unk> families , which were being launched to considerable attention in Germany during the latter 1920s . Gill Sans was released in 1928 by Monotype , initially as a set of titling capitals that was quickly followed by a lower @-@ case . Gill 's aim was to blend the influences of Johnston , classic serif typefaces and Roman inscriptions to create a design that looked both cleanly modern and classical at the same time . 
 Marketed by Monotype as a design of " classic simplicity and real beauty " , it was intended as a display typeface that could be used for posters and advertisements , as well as for the text of documents that need to be clearly legible at small sizes or from a distance , such as book blurbs , timetables and price lists . Designed before setting documents entirely in sans @-@ serif text was common , its standard weight is noticeably bolder than most modern body text fonts . 
 An immediate success , the year after its release the London and North Eastern Railway chose it for all its posters , timetables and publicity material , a use later extended across all British railways . It also soon became used on the modernist , deliberately simple covers of Penguin books , and was sold up to very large sizes which were often used in British posters and notices of the period . Gill Sans was one of the dominant typefaces in British printing in the years following its release , and remains extremely popular : it has been described as " the English Helvetica " because of its lasting popularity in British design . Gill Sans has influenced many other typefaces , and helped to define a genre of sans @-@ serif , known as the humanist style . 
 Monotype rapidly expanded the original regular or medium weight into a large family of styles , which it continues to sell . A basic set is included with some Microsoft software and Mac OS X. 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The proportions of Gill Sans stem from monumental Roman capitals in the upper case , and traditional " old @-@ style " serif letters in the lower . This gives Gill Sans a very different style of design to geometric sans @-@ serifs like Futura , based on simple squares and circles , or realist or grotesque designs like <unk> @-@ <unk> , Helvetica and Univers influenced by nineteenth @-@ century lettering styles . For example , compared to realist sans @-@ serifs the " C " and " a " have a much less " folded up " structure , with wider apertures . The " a " and " g " in the roman or regular style are " double @-@ storey " designs , rather than the " single @-@ storey " forms used in handwriting and blackletter often found in grotesque and especially geometric sans @-@ serifs . 
 The upper @-@ case of Gill Sans is partly modelled on Roman capitals like those found on the Column of Trajan . Edward Johnston in one of his books on lettering had written that " the Roman capitals have held the supreme place among letters for <unk> and beauty . They are the best forms for the grandest and most important inscriptions . " While Gill Sans is not based on purely geometric principles to the extent of the geometric sans @-@ serifs that had preceded it , some aspects of Gill Sans do nonetheless have a geometric feel . The " O " is an almost perfect circle and the capital " M " is based on the proportions of a square with the middle strokes meeting at the centre ; this was not inspired by Roman carving but is very similar to Johnston . But the influence of traditional serif letters is clear in the " two @-@ storey " lower @-@ case " a " and " g , " unlike that of Futura , and the " t " with its curve to bottom right and slanting cut at top left , unlike Futura 's which is simply formed from two straight lines . The lower @-@ case " a " also narrows strikingly towards the top of its loop , a common feature of serif designs but rarer in sans @-@ serifs . 
 Following the traditional serif model the italic has different letterforms from the roman , where many sans @-@ serifs simply slant the letters in what is called an oblique style . This is clearest in the " a " , which becomes a " single storey " design similar to handwriting , and the lower @-@ case " p " , which has a calligraphic tail on the left reminiscent of italics such as those cut by Caslon in the eighteenth century . The italic is nonetheless quite restrained , almost an oblique in many characters such as the " e " with its straight line on the underside of the bowl where serif fonts normally add a curve . Like most serif fonts ( but unlike most sans @-@ serif fonts ) , several weights and releases of Gill Sans use ligatures to allow its expansive letter " f " to join up with or avoid colliding with following letters . 
 The basic letter shapes do not look consistent across styles ( or even in the metal type era all the sizes of the same style ) , especially in Extra Bold and Extra Condensed widths , while the Ultra Bold style is effectively a different design altogether and was originally marketed as such . Monotype executive Dan Rhatigan , author of an article on Gill Sans 's development after Gill 's death , has commented that " Gill Sans grew organically ... [ it ] takes a very ' <unk> ' approach to type . Very characteristic of when it was designed and of when it was used . " ( At this time the idea that sans @-@ serif typefaces should form a consistent family , with glyph shapes as consistent as possible between all weights and sizes , had not fully developed : it was quite normal for families to vary as seemed appropriate for their weight until developments such as the groundbreaking release of Univers in 1957 . ) 
 In the light weights , the slanting cut at top left of the regular " t " is replaced with two separate strokes . From the bold weight upwards Gill Sans has an extremely eccentric design of " i " and " j " with the dots ( <unk> ) smaller than their parent letter 's stroke . 
 = = Development = = 
 Morison commissioned Gill to develop Gill Sans after they had begun to work together on Gill 's serif design Perpetua from 1925 onwards . Morison is known to have visited Cleverdon 's bookshop while in Bristol in 1927 where he would have seen Gill 's fascia and alphabet . Gill wrote that " it was as a consequence of seeing these letters " that Morison commissioned him to develop them , although this may not have been the exact point when he started to consider commissioning a sans @-@ serif design from Gill ; they had been collaborating for some years by this point and could have discussed the idea earlier . In the period during and after his closest collaboration with Johnston , Gill had intermittently worked on sans @-@ serif letter designs , including an almost sans @-@ serif capital design in an alphabet for sign @-@ painters in the 1910s , some " absolutely legible @-@ to @-@ the @-@ last @-@ degree ... simple block letters " for Army and Navy Stores in 1925 and some capital letter signs around his home in Capel @-@ y @-@ <unk> , Wales . Gill had greatly admired Johnston 's work on their Underground project , which he wrote had redeemed the sans @-@ serif from its " nineteenth @-@ century corruption " of extreme boldness . Johnston apparently had not tried to turn the alphabet ( as it was then called ) that he had designed into a commercial typeface project . He had tried to get involved in type design before starting work on Johnston Sans , but without success since the industry at the time mostly created designs in @-@ house . Morison similarly respected the design of the Underground system , one of the first uses of a standard lettering style as corporate branding , writing that it " conferred upon [ the lettering ] a sanction , civic and commercial , as had not been accorded to an alphabet since the time of Charlemagne . " 
 Morison and Gill had met with some tension within Monotype while developing Perpetua and while Morison was an enthusiastic backer of the project , Monotype 's engineering manager and type designer F. H. Pierpont was deeply unconvinced , commenting that he could " see nothing in this design to recommend it and much that is objectionable " . ( Pierpont was the creator of Monotype 's previous mainstay sans @-@ serif , a loose family now called Monotype Grotesque . It is a much less sculptured design inspired by German sans @-@ serifs . ) Morison also intervened to insist that the letters " J " and " Q " be allowed to elegantly descend below the baseline , something not normal for titling typefaces which were often made to fill up the entire area of the metal type . In the early days of its existence it was not always consistently simply called " Gill Sans " , with other names such as " Gill Sans @-@ serif " , " Monotype Sans @-@ <unk> " ( the latter two both used by Gill in some of his publications ) or its order numbers ( such as Series No. 231 ) sometimes used . 
 Extensive material on the development of Gill Sans survives through records in Monotype 's archives and in Gill 's papers . While the capitals ( which were prepared first ) resemble Johnston quite closely , the archives document Gill ( and the drawing office team at Monotype 's works in Salfords , who developed a final precise design and spacing ) grappling with the challenge of creating a viable humanist sans @-@ serif lower @-@ case and an italic , which Johnston did not have . Gill 's first draft proposed many slanting cuts on the ends of ascenders and descenders , looking less like Johnston than the final draft did . Early art for the italic looked very different , with <unk> on many capitals . However , Gill did not use the calligraphic italic " g " he would later use on his serif designs Perpetua and Joanna , using instead a standard " double @-@ story " " g " in italic . 
 In the regular or roman style of Gill Sans , some letters were simplified from Johnston , with diamond dots becoming round and the lower @-@ case " L " becoming a simple line , but the " a " became more complex with a curving tail in most versions and sizes . In addition , the design was simply refined in general , for example by making the horizontals slightly narrower than verticals so that they do not appear unbalanced , a standard technique in font design which Johnston had not used . The " R " with its widely splayed leg is Gill 's preferred design , unlike that of Johnston ; historian James Mosley has suggested that this may be inspired by an Italian Renaissance carving in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London . Particular areas of discussion during the design process were the " a " ( several versions and sizes in the hot metal era had a straight tail like Johnston 's or a mildly curving tail ) and the " b " , " d , " " p " and " q , " where some versions ( and sizes , since the same weight would not be identical at every size ) had stroke ends visible and others did not . Rhatigan has commented that Monotype 's archives contain " enough [ material ] for a book just about the " b , " " d " , " p " , and " q " of Gill Sans . " 
 The titling capitals of Gill Sans were first unveiled at a printing conference in 1928 ; it was also shown in a specimen issued in the <unk> magazine edited by Morison . While initial response was partly appreciative , it was still considered dubious by some ultra @-@ conservative printers who saw all sans @-@ serif type as modern and unsound ; one called it " typographical Bolshevism " . Sans @-@ serifs were still regarded as vulgar and commercial by purists in this period : Johnston 's pupil <unk> Hewitt privately commented of them that : 
 In Johnston I have lost confidence . Despite all he did for us ... he has undone too much by forsaking his standard of the Roman alphabet , giving the world , without safeguard or explanation , his block letters which disfigure our modern life . His prestige has obscured their vulgarity and commercialism . 
 Nonetheless , Gill Sans rapidly became popular after its release . 
 Gill broached the topic of the similarity with Johnston in a variety of ways in his work and writings , writing to Johnston in 1933 to apologise for the typeface bearing his name and describing Johnston 's work as being important and seminal . However , in his Essay on Typography , he proposed that his version was " perhaps an improvement " and more " fool @-@ proof " than Johnston 's . Johnston and Gill had drifted apart by the beginning of the 1920s , something Gill 's groundbreaking biographer Fiona MacCarthy describes as partly due to the anti @-@ Catholicism of Johnston 's wife Greta . Frank Pick , the Underground Electric Railways Company managing director who commissioned Johnston 's typeface , privately thought Gill Sans " a rather close copy " of Johnston 's work . Gill 's biographer Malcolm Yorke has described Gill as " tactless " in his claims that the design was " as much as possible mathematically measurable ... as little reliance as possible should be placed on the sensibility of the draughtsmen and others concerned in its machine <unk> " , when so much of the development process such as size @-@ specific design and spacing was contributed by Monotype 's largely anonymous but highly experienced drawing office team ; Monotype executive Daniel Rhatigan has made similar comments . 
 = = = Weights and styles = = = 
 Following the initial success of Gill Sans , Monotype rapidly produced a wide variety of other variants . In addition , Monotype sold moulds ( matrices ) for Gill Sans in very large sizes for their " <unk> " type @-@ casting equipment . Popular with advertisers , this allowed end @-@ users to cast their own type at a very competitive price . This made it a popular choice for posters . Gill 's biographer Malcolm Yorke has described it as " the essence of clarity for public notices " . 
 Versions of Gill Sans exist in a wide range of styles such as condensed and shadowed weights . An ultra @-@ light version slightly lighter than the normal light style was also not digitally available until the 2015 Nova release . Several shadowed designs are currently available , including a capitals @-@ only regular shadowed design and a light @-@ shadowed version with deep relief shadows . In the metal type era , a ' cameo ruled ' design that placed white letters in boxes or against a stippled black background was available . These can be used together with the regular , printing in different colours , to achieve a simple multicolour effect . Some of the decorative versions may predominantly have been designed by the Monotype office , with Gill examining , critiquing and approving the designs sent to him by post . Monotype would later also create a book weight , intermediate between the light and regular weight , suitable for body text . ( Gill 's colleague Robert Harling wrote in his anthology of the density of the basic weight making it ugly in extended passages of text , printing a passage in it as a demonstration . The suspicion that Gill Sans ' lower @-@ case is less of a success than its capitals began early : William Addison Dwiggins called it and Futura " fine in the capitals and bum in the lower @-@ case " while proposing to create an alternative , Metro , for Linotype around 1929 . ) The long series of extensions , <unk> and conversions into new formats of one of Monotype 's most important designs ( extending long beyond Gill 's death ) has left Gill Sans with a great range of alternative designs and releases . 
 = = = Gill Kayo = = = 
 In 1936 , Gill and Monotype released an extremely bold design named Kayo ( from KO , or knockout , implying its solidity ) . This has often been branded as Gill Sans Ultra Bold , though in practice many letters vary considerably from the structure of Gill Sans . It is available in regular and condensed widths . Gill , who thought of the design as something of a novelty , considered naming it " Double <unk> " . Gill 's colleague Robert Harling ( who many years later would collect an anthology and assessment of Gill 's lettering ) described it as " dismal " and sarcastically commented that " typographical historians of 2000AD ( which isn 't , after all , so very far away ) will find this odd outburst in Mr Gill 's career , and will spend much time in attempting to track down this sad psychological state of his during 1936 . " In his 1976 book on Gill 's work , he described it as " the most horrendous and <unk> of these display exploitations " . Some initial drawings of Kayo may have been prepared by Gill 's son @-@ in @-@ law Denis <unk> ; it was particularly popular in graphic design of the 1970s and 80s . 
 The bold weights of Gill Sans , including Kayo , are particularly controversial for design issues such as the eccentric design of the " i " and " j " , and for their extreme boldness . ( Gill Sans ' standard weight is , as already noted , already quite bold by modern standards . ) Gill argued in his Essay on Typography that the nineteenth @-@ century tendency to make sans @-@ serif typefaces attention @-@ <unk> bold was self @-@ defeating , since the result was compromised legibility . In the closing paragraph he ruefully noted how he had contributed to the genre : 
 There are now about as many different varieties of letters as there are different kinds of fools . I myself am responsible for designing five different sorts of sans @-@ serif letters – each one thicker and fatter than the last because each advertisement has to try and shout down its neighbours . 
 = = = Alternate characters = = = 
 To cater for the tastes and national printing styles of different countries , Monotype developed a set of alternate characters . These include Futura @-@ inspired designs of " N " , " M " , " R " , " a " , " g " , " t " and others , a four @-@ terminal " W " in the French style , tighter versions of " R " , an alternative " Q " with tail that looped upwards ( similar to that on Century among others , and preferred by the LNER ) , oblique designs as opposed to the standard true italic , a more curving , true @-@ italic " e " and several alternative numeral designs . In particular , in the standard designs for Gill Sans the numeral " 1 " , upper @-@ case " i " and lower @-@ case " L " are all a vertical line and look identical , so an alternate " 1 " with a serif was sold for number @-@ heavy situations where this could otherwise cause confusion , such as on price @-@ lists . ( Not all timetables used it : for example , the <unk> preferred the simple version . ) Some early versions of Gill Sans also had features later abandoned such as an unusual " 7 " matching the curve of the " 9 " , a " 5 " with a different shape , and a lower @-@ case letter @-@ height " 0 " . 
 Gill was involved in the design of these alternates , and Monotype 's archive preserves notes that he rethought the geometric alternates . With the increasing popularity of Futura Gill Sans was not alone in being adapted : both <unk> and Dwiggins ' Metro would undergo what historian Paul Shaw has called a " Futura @-@ <unk> " to conform to taste . Monotype would later add text figures to Gill Sans , numbers at the height of lower @-@ case letters . Popular in design for body text , these are a traditional feature on serif fonts which Gill Sans did not originally have . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Monotype offered Gill Sans on film in the phototypesetting period . The fonts released in 1961 included Light 362 , Series 262 , Bold 275 , Extra Bold 321 , Condensed 343 , all of which were released in film matrix sets " A " ( 6 – 7 points ) and " B " ( 8 – 22 , 24 points ) . Also after Gill 's death , Monotype created versions for the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets . 
 = = = Infant and rounded versions = = = 
 Monotype created an ' infant ' version of Gill Sans using single @-@ storey " a " and " g " , and other more distinguishable characters such as a rounded " y " , seriffed " 1 " and lower @-@ case " L " with a turn at the bottom . Infant designs of fonts are often used in education and toys as the letters are thought to be more recognisable to children being based on handwriting , and are often produced to supplement popular fonts such as <unk> @-@ <unk> and Bembo . Monotype also created a version with rounded stroke ends for John Lewis for use on toys . 
 = = Digital releases = = 
 The digital releases of Gill Sans fall into several main phases : releases before 2005 ( which includes most bundled " system " versions of Gill Sans ) , the 2005 Pro edition , and the 2015 Nova release which adds many alternate characters and is in part included with Windows 10 . In general characteristics for common weights the designs are similar , but there are some changes : for example , in the book weight the 2005 release used circular ij dots but the 2015 release uses square designs , and the 2015 release simplifies some ligatures . Digital Gill Sans also gained character sets not present in the metal type , including text figures and small capitals . 
 Like all metal type revivals , reviving Gill Sans in digital form raises several decisions of interpretation , such as the issue of how to compensate for the ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger . As a result , printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match . The digital release of Gill Sans , like many Monotype digitisations , has been criticised , in particular for excessively tight letter @-@ spacing and lack of optical sizes : with only one design released that has to be used at any text size , it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and spacing of the metal type , for which every size was drawn differently . In the hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type , with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text sizes . In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master , but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital . To replicate this , it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes , such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes . 
 Former <unk> president John Berry commented of Gill Sans ' modernised spacing that " both the regular weight and especially the light weight look much better when they 're tracked loose . " In contrast , Walter Tracy wrote that he preferred the later spacing : " the metal version ... was spaced , I suspect , as if it were a serif face " . 
 = = = Gill Sans Nova ( 2015 ) = = = 
 A massive remastering and expansion , Gill Sans Nova adds many additional variants , including some of the previously <unk> inline versions and stylistic alternates and an ultra @-@ light weight ( once an option in metal type ) which had been digitised for Grazia . The basic set of Regular , Light and Bold weights is bundled with Windows 10 . The fonts differ from Gill Sans MT in their adoption of the hooked 1 as default , while the regular weight is renamed ' Medium ' . Monotype celebrated the release with a London exhibition on Gill 's work , as they had in 1958 to mark the general release of Gill 's serif design Joanna . One addition was italic swash caps , which had been considered by Gill but never released . 
 = = Usage = = 
 First unveiled in a single uppercase weight in 1928 , Gill Sans achieved national prominence almost immediately , when it was chosen the following year to become the standard typeface for the LNER railway system , soon appearing on every facet of the company 's identity , from metal locomotive nameplates and hand @-@ painted station signage to printed restaurant car menus , timetables and advertising posters . The LNER promoted their rebranding by offering Gill ( who was fascinated with railway engines ) a footplate ride on the Flying Scotsman express service ; he also painted for it a signboard in the style of Gill Sans , which survives in the collection of the St Bride Library . 
 When British Railways was created by nationalisation in 1948 , Gill Sans was used in much of its printed output , very often in capitals @-@ only settings for signage . Specially drawn variations were developed by the Railway Executive ( part of the British Transport Commission ) for signs in its manual for the use of <unk> painting large signs by hand . Other users included Penguin Books ' iconic paperback jacket designs from 1935 and British official mapping agency Ordnance Survey . It was also used by London Transport for documents which could not be practically set in Johnston . Paul Shaw , a historian of printing , has described it as a key element of the ' Modernist classical ' style from the 1930s to the 1950s , that promoted clean , spare design , often with all @-@ capitals and centred setting of headings . 
 Gill Sans remains popular , although a trend away from it towards grotesque and neo @-@ grotesque typefaces took place around the 1950s and 1960s under the influence of continental and American design . <unk> that became popular around this time included original early " grotesque " sans @-@ serifs , as well as new and more elegant designs in the same style such as Helvetica and Univers . Mosley has commented that in 1960 " orders unexpectedly revived " for the old Monotype Grotesque design : " [ it ] represents , even more evocatively than Univers , the fresh revolutionary breeze that began to blow through typography in the early sixties . " He added in 2007 " its rather clumsy design seems to have been one of the chief attractions to iconoclastic designers tired of the ... prettiness of Gill Sans " . As an example of this trend , Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert 's corporate rebranding of BR as British Rail in 1965 introduced Helvetica and Univers for printed matter and the custom but very similar Rail Alphabet for signage , and abandoned the classical , all caps signage style with which Gill Sans is often associated . Kinneir and Calvert 's road signage redesign used a similar approach . 
 An additional development which reduced Gill Sans ' dominance was the arrival of phototypesetting , which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and ( especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer ) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used . Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects ; their sans @-@ serif <unk> and Stephenson Blake 's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense , industrial designs . Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s , when he was growing up , James Mosley would later write : 
 The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape ... in Britain , at any rate , they were so ubiquitous that , while their excellent quality was undeniable , it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented . In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long . The death of metal type ... seemed at last to be happening . 
 While extremely popular in Britain , and to a lesser extent in European printing , Gill Sans did not achieve popularity with American printers in the hot metal era , with most preferring gothic designs like Franklin Gothic and geometric designs like Futura and Monotype 's own Twentieth Century . Monotype 's competitor Linotype was dominant in the American market at the time , which may have been a factor in this . The shadow @-@ effect capitals @-@ only fonts appear in some US specimen brochures that otherwise excluded it in this period . Gill Sans therefore particularly achieved worldwide popularity after the close of the metal type era and in the phototypesetting and digital era , when it became a system font on Macintosh computers and Microsoft Office . One use of Gill 's work in the United States in this early period , however , was a custom wordmark and logo made by Gill for Poetry magazine in 1930 based on Gill Sans . Its editor Harriet Monroe had seen Gill 's work in London . 
 The BBC adopted the typeface as its corporate typeface in 1997 for many but not all purposes , including on its logo . Explaining the change , designer Martin Lambie @-@ Nairn said that " by choosing a typeface that has stood the test of time , we avoid the trap of going down a modish route that might look outdated in several years ' time . " The BBC had an earlier association with Gill , who created some sculptures on Broadcasting House . Other more recent British organisations using Gill Sans have included Railtrack ( and initially its successor Network Rail ) , John Lewis and the Church of England , which adopted Gill Sans as the typeface for the definitive Common Worship family of service books published from 2000 . Notable non @-@ British modern businesses using Gill Sans include United Colours of Benetton ( which commissioned a custom variant ) , Tommy Hilfiger and Saab Automobile . British rock band Bloc Party has used Gill Sans in its logo . AT & T used it until 2006 , before changing it to Clearview after feeling that it was too in keeping with market research that people found the company " monolithic . " Edward Tufte , the information design theorist , uses Gill Sans on his website and in some of his published works . The Wikimedia Foundation uses Gill Sans on its wordmark .

 = = = Early competitors = = = 
 An immediate metal type competitor to Gill Sans was Granby from Stephenson Blake ; it was based on Gill Sans and also Johnston . Stephenson Blake had cut the original metal type for Johnston , making them familiar with its design and perhaps explaining its Johnston @-@ influenced diamond @-@ dot <unk> . A large family , it also included a " Granby Elephant " weight influenced by Gill Kayo . 
 Another similar but more eccentric design was created by Johnston 's student Harold Curwen for the use of his family company , the Curwen Press of Plaistow . Named " Curwen Sans " or " Curwen Modern " , it has many similarities to Johnston also , and was occasionally used by London Transport in work printed by the Curwen Press . Curwen described it as based on his time studying with Johnston in the 1900s , although it was not cut into metal until 1928 , around the same time as Gill Sans was released . Jan Tschichold , who would later make extensive use of Gill Sans while designing books for Penguin , created a similar design for an early phototype machine , which was at the time little @-@ used . 
 Besides similar fonts , many signs and objects made in Britain during the period of Gill Sans ' dominance , such as the famous Keep Calm and Carry On poster , received hand @-@ painted or custom lettering similar to Gill Sans . Fighter Command during the war used a standard set of letters similar to it and Matthew Carter , later a prominent font designer , recalled in a 2005 profile playing with linoleum block letters in the style cut by his mother during the Blitz . 
 = = = Later and digital @-@ only designs = = = 
 The category of humanist sans @-@ serif typefaces , which Gill Sans helped to define , saw great attention during the 1980s and 1990s , especially as a reaction against the overwhelming popularity of Helvetica and Univers in the 1960s and 1970s . It can be identified by a tendency to use ' double @-@ storey ' as and <unk> in the roman and " single @-@ storey " as in italic , like serif fonts . 
 Modern sans @-@ serif designs inspired by Gill often adapt the concept by creating a design better proportioned and spaced for body text , or create a wider and more homogeneous range of weights , something easier since the arrival of the computer due to the use of multiple master or interpolation . Jeremy <unk> 's Bliss and Volker <unk> 's Today Sans are modern variations . Rowton Sans is inspired by Gill but has a nearly upright italic , similar to that used by Gill in his serif font Joanna . More distantly , Arthur Vanson 's Chesham Sans is inspired by the British tradition of sans @-@ serif <unk> , with many similarities to Gill 's work . Bitstream 's Humanist 521 was an unofficial digitisation , to which its Russian licensee <unk> added a Cyrillic version in 1997 . The companies <unk> and <unk> also released Gill Sans digitisations under different names including ' Chantilly ' , ' Gibson ' and others . 
 More loosely , Syntax by Hans Eduard Meier is similar in some ways . Released in 1968 , it was intended to be a more dynamic , handwriting @-@ influenced sans @-@ serif form . Tschichold , whose serif font Sabon had influenced it , described it as " very easy to read , well designed : better than the related Gill Sans . " Its italic is , however , more of an oblique than Gill 's . Hypatia Sans , designed by Thomas Phinney and released by Adobe , was intended to be a more characterful humanist sans design . 
 = = = Font superfamilies = = = 
 A logical extension of the humanist sans @-@ serif concept is the font superfamily : a serif font and a matching humanist sans @-@ serif with similar letterforms . Martin <unk> 's FF Scala Sans is a popular example of this influenced by Gill 's work , as are Charlotte Sans and <unk> by Letraset and Mr and Mrs Eaves by <unk> <unk> , which are based on Baskerville . Indeed , Monotype themselves released Joanna Sans in 2015 , as a screen @-@ optimised sans @-@ serif font intended to complement ( but not exactly match ) Gill 's serif design Joanna . It is intended for use at smaller sizes than Gill Sans .

 <unk> designs are in many countries not copyrightable , while in others such as the United Kingdom the design is out of copyright with 70 years passed since Gill 's death in 1940 , by which time the metal type family was essentially completed . This makes it legally permissible to create alternative digitised versions of Gill Sans ( although not necessarily of later Monotype additions to the font such as the book weight and Euro sign ) . However , the name " Gill Sans " remains a Monotype trademark ( no . <unk> in the US ) and therefore is not eligible to be used to name any derivative font . 
 No complete , direct open @-@ source Gill Sans clone has yet been released . One of the most extensive is <unk> , a derivative by the <unk> Digital Foundry project and designer <unk> <unk> , which includes bold , italic , condensed and condensed bold styles . It is not a pure clone , but rather partly created by modifying Bitstream Vera , and adds influences from geometric fonts particularly visible in the design of the " w " . K22 , a foundry in Quezon City operated by the designer " Toto G " , has released two Gill Sans shadowed variants as K22 <unk> Shadow ( digitising the Gill Sans Shadow 338 design ) and K22 <unk> Shadow Line , an inline variant , for free for " personal , private and non @-@ commercial purposes " and for sale for commercial use . A direct clone of the medium weight , Sans Guilt , was released by Brussels open source design group OSP in 2011 , but it contains several obvious glitches such as misaligned " w " and " x " characters . As a pioneering example of the humanist sans @-@ serif style , many other designs are influenced by Gill Sans to some extent . 
 = Think of the children = 
 " Think of the children " ( also " What about the children ? " ) is a phrase which evolved into a rhetorical tactic . Literally it refers to children 's rights ( as in discussions of child labor ) . In debate , however , as a plea for pity , used as an appeal to emotion , it is a logical fallacy . 
 Art , Argument , and Advocacy ( 2002 ) argued that the appeal substitutes emotion for reason in debate . Ethicist Jack Marshall wrote in 2005 that the phrase 's popularity stems from its capacity to stunt rationality , particularly discourse on morals . " Think of the children " has been invoked by censorship proponents to shield children from perceived danger . Community , Space and Online Censorship ( 2009 ) noted that classifying children in an infantile manner , as innocents in need of protection , is a form of obsession over the concept of purity . A 2011 article in the Journal for Cultural Research observed that the phrase grew out of a moral panic . 
 It was an exhortation in the 1964 Disney film Mary Poppins , when the character of Mrs. Banks pleaded with her departing nanny not to quit and to " think of the children ! " The phrase was popularized as a satiric reference on the animated television program The Simpsons in 1996 , when character Helen Lovejoy pleaded " Won 't somebody please think of the children ! " during a contentious debate by citizens of the fictional town of Springfield . 
 In the 2012 Georgia State University Law Review , Charles J. Ten Brink called Lovejoy 's use of " Think of the children " a successful parody . The appeal 's subsequent use in society was often the subject of mockery . After its popularization on The Simpsons , the phrase has been called " Lovejoy 's Law " , the " Helen Lovejoy defence " , the " Helen Lovejoy Syndrome " , and " think @-@ of @-@ the @-@ children @-@ ism " .

 Sociologist Joel Best wrote in 1993 that during the late 19th century , adults developed an increased concern for the welfare of children . Best noted that societies experienced decreasing birth rates after industrialization , with parents focusing their attention on fewer children . According to him , at that time adults began to view childhood as a sacred period of development and children as invaluable , adorable , guiltless beings . During the 1970s and 1980s , Best wrote , adults saw children as potential victims and sought to eliminate perceived threats . 
 In the 1995 compilation Children and the Politics of Culture , anthropologist Vivienne Wee analyzed the perception of children by adults and how it supported the concept of children 's rights . Wee wrote that in this model ( which she called the European pattern ) , children were seen as defenseless , unadulterated , and in need of protection by authoritative adults . According to Wee , this European pattern led to the idea that children required the sanctuary of the United Nations Charter and the Convention on the Rights of the Child . 
 Wee wrote : " Alternatively , children 's vulnerability could be interpreted as purity and innocence , needing the protection of responsible adults . It is this second , protective mode of interpretation that underlies the very idea of children 's rights , needing the protection of a UN charter – hence the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child . " She observed that the view of youth as weak and innocent focused on what might occur if children 's rights were not shielded . 
 Wee argued that this behavior towards children was not entirely positive . According to her , this mindset may lead to hypocrisy by adults who assume that all their actions intend to protect children and creates the risk that adults may wield power " for the children 's own good " . Noting that adult authority may be masked as empathy , Wee concluded : " These alternative cultural interpretations of the vulnerability of children would thus generate their own respective political and psychological consequences . " 
 = = Child advocacy = = 
 " Think of the children " has been used in its literal sense to advocate for the rights of children . Early usage during the 20th century included writings in 1914 by the National Child Labor Committee criticizing child labor standards in the United States . U.S. President Bill Clinton used the phrase in a 1999 speech to the International Labour Organization , asking his audience to imagine a significant reduction in child labor : " Think of the children ... freed of the crushing burden of dangerous and demeaning work , given back those irreplaceable hours of childhood for learning and playing and living . " 
 The phrase 's literal use extends into the 21st century , with Sara Boyce of the Children 's Law Centre in Northern Ireland drawing on it to advocate for the legal rights of the region 's children . The 2008 book Child Labour in a <unk> World used the phrase to call attention to the role of debt bondage in child labor . Sara Dillon of Suffolk University Law School used the phrase " What about the children " in her 2009 book , International Children 's Rights , to focus on child @-@ labor program conditions . Benjamin Powell used the phrase differently in his book , Out of Poverty : <unk> in the Global Economy , writing that in the absence of child labor some youth faced starvation . In a 2010 book on human rights , Children 's Rights and Human Development , child psychiatrist Bruce D. Perry used the phrase " think of the children " to urge clinicians to incorporate a process sensitive to developmental stages when counseling youth .

 In their 2002 book , Art , Argument , and Advocacy : Mastering Parliamentary Debate , John Meany and Kate Shuster called the use of the phrase " Think of the children " in debate a type of logical fallacy and an appeal to emotion . According to the authors , a debater may use the phrase to emotionally sway members of the audience and avoid logical discussion . They provide an example : " I know this national missile defense plan has its detractors , but won 't someone please think of the children ? " Their assessment was echoed by Margie <unk> in an article for the journal Media International Australia incorporating Culture and Policy , with <unk> calling its use a rhetorical tactic . 
 Ethicist Jack Marshall described " Think of the children ! " as a tactic used in an attempt to end discussion by invoking an unanswerable argument . According to Marshall , the strategy succeeds in preventing rational debate . He called its use an unethical manner of obfuscating debate , misdirecting empathy towards an object which may not have been the focus of the original argument . Marshall wrote that although the phrase 's use may have a positive intention , it evokes irrationality when repeatedly used by both sides of a debate . He concluded that the phrase can transform the observance of regulations into an ethical quandary , cautioning society to avoid using " Think of the children ! " as a final argument . 
 In his 2015 syndicated article " Think Of The Children " , Michael Reagan criticized the phrase 's use by politicians . According to Reagan , politicians needed to stop using children as tools when arguing for favored governmental programs . He called the tactic an illogical argument , an act of desperation by those who felt they had a weaker case with reason @-@ based arguments . Noting that it has been used by Democrats and Republicans alike in the United States , Reagan called the tactic " obvious political BS " .

 The Journal for Cultural Research published an article in 2010 by Debra <unk> , which was republished in the 2011 book Hope and Feminist Theory . According to <unk> , media use of " Won 't someone think of the children ! " had become common in a climate of moral panic . She suggested that the phrase was becoming so common that it could become another Godwin 's law . 
 In a 2011 article for the journal Post Script , Andrew Scahill wrote about the power of children in rhetoric to create an untenable stance for an opposing viewpoint . According to Scahill , an individual arguing " for the children " makes it extremely difficult for an opponent to hold a " not for the children " position . Cassandra Wilkinson discussed the impact of " think of the children " rhetoric in a 2011 article for IPA Review . Wilkinson cited research by No Fear : Growing Up in a Risk @-@ <unk> Society author Tim Gill that hypersensitivity in defending children from potential harm has the adverse effect of contributing to the inability of youth to own their choices and react to dangerous situations . In the New Statesman , Laurie Penny characterized the tactic as a political belief system and called it " think @-@ of @-@ the @-@ children @-@ ism " . 
 Elizabeth Stoker <unk> wrote in a 2014 article for First Things that moralizing with the phrase was commonly seen in discussions of sexuality , attributing this to society 's increasing perception of morality as a feminine domain . <unk> also cited the labeling of NBC 's refusal to broadcast a movie trailer about abortion as " think @-@ of @-@ the @-@ children @-@ ism " . 
 = = = Censorship = = = 
 Scott Beattie wrote in his 2009 book , Community , Space and Online Censorship , that the question " Will no one think of the children ? " was often raised by individuals advocating censorship out of a concern that youth might view material deemed inappropriate . According to Beattie , youngsters were cast as potential casualties of online sexual predators to increase regulation of the Internet ; characterizing children as infantile evoked a concept of innocence which was a form of obsession over the concept of purity . 
 For Make magazine , Cory Doctorow wrote in a 2011 article that " Won 't someone think of the children ? ! " was used by irrational individuals to support arguments about the dangers to youth of the " Four Horsemen of the <unk> " : " pirates " , terrorists , organized crime , and child pornographers . According to Doctorow , the phrase was used to stifle discussion of underlying issues and halt rational analysis . He observed its frequent use when society was determining an appropriate approach to the legal aspects of computing . 
 In his 2013 book , <unk> Filmmaking , Mike Watt discussed the history of censorship relative to the United Kingdom 's Obscene Publications Act 1959 and noted that films banned during that period became known as " video nasties " . Watt called a current interpretation of such censorship the " Think of the Children " characterization . Brian M. Reed wrote in his book , Nobody 's Business ( also published that year ) , that the phrase was devoid of substance and could be replaced for comic effect with " How many kittens must die ? " 
 For Reason in 2015 , journalist Brendan O 'Neill wrote that Marjorie Heins ' Not in Front of the Children : <unk> , Censorship , and the Innocence of Youth cited the centuries @-@ long use by governments of the prevention of " harm to minors " as an excuse to increase censorship and control . According to O 'Neill , the use of " Won 't somebody please think of the children ? " in contemporary culture had greatly increased and was a means of exerting moral authority with emotional blackmail .

 According to Kathryn Laity , early use of the phrase may have stemmed from its appearance in the 1964 Walt Disney Pictures film Mary Poppins . In an opening scene , the character of Mrs. Banks pleads with her nanny not to quit by begging her to " think of the children ! " . Laity wrote that the popular use of the phrase evokes strong feelings in those who object to a nanny state , pointing out the conflict in the United States between the country 's conservatism ( derived from the Puritans ) and its capitalist desire to use sex in advertising . 
 " Think of the children " was popularized largely by character Helen Lovejoy , wife of Reverend Lovejoy , on the television program The Simpsons . Lovejoy ( who first appeared in 1990 ) repeatedly exclaimed , " Think of the children ! " in several episodes of the series . She first used the phrase in the episode " Much Apu About Nothing " by David X. Cohen , which aired in 1996 . Lovejoy 's exhortation became increasingly overwrought with each subsequent use . 
 Simpsons writer Bill Oakley said in the 2005 DVD commentary on the episode that the motivation for the phrase on the show was to emphasize how " think of the children " was used in debate ; irrelevant , it sidetracked discussion from the original issues . Lovejoy used variations of the phrase , including " Oh , won 't somebody please think of the children " and " What about the children " , shrieking it most often when residents of the fictional town of Springfield debated a contentious problem or argued about politics and logic failed . Lovejoy 's comic use of the phrase on The Simpsons satirized its use in public discourse . 
 = = = Lovejoy 's Law = = = 
 After the popularization of the phrase on The Simpsons , its use in society was often ridiculed . In the Toronto Star , journalist Edward Keenan referred to it as " Lovejoy 's Law " . Keenan defined " Lovejoy 's Law " as a warning that the phrase is a probable diversion from a weak logical stance , writing that true empathy toward children involved rational argument rather than manipulation . In an article for Ireland 's Sunday Independent , Carol Hunt called the use of the phrase in political debate the " Helen Lovejoy defence " and wrote that it is also known as the " Helen Lovejoy syndrome " . According to Hunt , it is often invoked in reference to hypothetical children rather than real children affected by a problem . 
 In a Georgia State University Law Review article , Michigan State University College of Law professor Charles J. Ten Brink wrote that Helen Lovejoy 's signature phrase was an adept and effective parody . According to The Canberra Times , the phrase 's 2009 use to support Internet censorship by the Department of Communications of the government of Australia was evocative of Helen Lovejoy . 
 In his book , The Myth of Evil , Phillip A. Cole wrote that Helen Lovejoy 's plea assumed that children were pure , unadulterated potential casualties who required constant defense from danger . Cole contrasted this notion with character Bart Simpson , who prefers creating disorder to conformity and adherence to regulations . According to Cole , this exemplifies the dual perception of children by society : guileless potential prey and malevolent entities to be distrusted . Cole wrote that throughout history , the child has represented humanity 's savage past and its optimistic future . Jo Johnson contributed a chapter , " Won 't Somebody Think of the Children ? " , to the book Mediating Moms , in which she analyzed the phrase 's use in animated media ( including The Simpsons ) . According to Johnson , the phrase was a key example of popular cultural depictions of mothers as neurotic and filled with anxiety about moral values . 
 = The Broken Ear = 
 The Broken Ear ( French : L 'Oreille cassée ) , also published as Tintin and the Broken Ear , is the sixth volume of The Adventures of Tintin , the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé . Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle for its children 's supplement Le Petit Vingtième , it was serialised weekly from December 1935 to February 1937 . The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy , who pursue the thieves of a South American fetish identifiable by its broken ear . In doing so , he ends up in the fictional nation of San Theodoros , where he becomes embroiled in a civil war and discovers the Arumbaya tribe deep in the forest . 
 The Broken Ear was a commercial success and was published in book form shortly after its conclusion . Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Black Island , while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco @-@ Belgian comics tradition . In 1943 , The Broken Ear was coloured and reformatted for republication by Casterman . The Broken Ear introduces the recurring character General Alcazar , and was the first to include fictional countries . The story was adapted for both the 1956 Belvision animation , Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin , and for the 1991 Ellipse / Nelvana animated series The Adventures of Tintin . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Tintin investigates when a fetish created by the Arumbaya tribe of South America is stolen from Brussels ' Museum of Ethnography , only to be returned the following day . Tintin realises that the replacement is a fake , and draws a connection to a local sculptor Jacob Balthazar , who has recently been murdered . Balthazar 's parrot — a witness to the murder — is obtained by two Hispanic men , Alonso Pérez and Ramón Bada , who try to kill Tintin when he begins to investigate their connection to the crime . From the parrot , Alonso and Ramón discover that Balthazar was murdered by Rodrigo Tortilla , and they follow him aboard a ship bound for South America . There , they murder Tortilla , but find that he did not have the original fetish . Tintin arranges their arrest when the ship docks at Los <unk> , capital of San Theodoros . 
 In the city , Tintin is framed as a terrorist , arrested , and sentenced to death by firing squad ; but survives when a revolution topples the government , and the new leader , General Alcazar , appoints Tintin his aide @-@ de @-@ camp . Alonso and Ramón capture Tintin , and interrogate him in the hope of locating the missing fetish , but he escapes and apprehends them . 
 As aide @-@ de @-@ camp , Tintin opposes Alcazar 's decision to go to war with neighbouring Nuevo Rico over the oil @-@ rich Gran Chapo , and is framed as a traitor by the international oil and weapon companies . He escapes imprisonment with the aid of the mercenary Pablo ; and decides to enter the forest and find the Arumbayas , in the hope that they can explain to him why people wish to steal the fetish . From a British explorer , Ridgewell , living among the Arumbaya , Tintin learns that a diamond was stolen and hidden inside the statue . 
 Returning to Belgium , Tintin discovers that Balthazar 's brother has produced a range of replicas of the fetish , which he had discovered among his deceased brother 's belongings , and learns that the original has been purchased by a wealthy American , Mr. <unk> ; now aboard a ship to the United States . Catching up to the boat , Tintin finds that Alonso and Ramón are aboard , and they struggle for the possession of the fetish . It smashes on the deck , with the diamond falling into the sea . Tintin , Alonso and Ramón struggle , and fall overboard . Tintin is rescued , but Alonso and Ramón drown and are shown en route to Hell . <unk> gives Tintin the stolen fetish to return to the museum , where it is repaired and put back on display .

 Georges Remi — best known under the pen name Hergé — was employed as editor and illustrator of Le Petit Vingtième ( " The Little Twentieth " ) , a children 's supplement to Le Vingtième Siècle ( " The Twentieth Century " ) , a staunchly Roman Catholic , conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé 's native Brussels which was run by the Abbé Norbert Wallez . In 1929 , Hergé began The Adventures of Tintin comic strip for Le Petit Vingtième , revolving around the exploits of fictional Belgian reporter Tintin . Wallez ordered Hergé to set his first adventure in the Soviet Union as anti @-@ socialist propaganda for children ( Tintin in the Land of the Soviets ) , to set his second adventure in the Belgian Congo to encourage colonial sentiment ( Tintin in the Congo ) , and to set his third adventure in the United States to use the story as a denunciation of American capitalism ( Tintin in America ) . Wallez was subsequently removed from the paper 's editorship following a scandal , although Hergé was convinced to stay on the condition of a salary increase . In preparing The Broken Ear , Hergé developed the new habit of keeping plot notes and ideas in a notebook . He also began making cuttings of photographs and other images from magazines and newspapers , filing them away for future use ; he used them as a basis for many of the drawings in The Broken Ear . 
 Hergé used The Broken Ear to allude to real events that had recently taken place in South America . The fictional countries of San Theodoros and Nuevo Rico were based on the real countries Bolivia and Paraguay , while the Gran Chapo War depicted in the strip was an allusion to the Gran Chaco War ( 1932 – 35 ) that was waged between Bolivian and Paraguayan forces over lucrative oil fields in the Gran Chaco region . The name " Gran Chapo " was a pun on the French grand chapeau , meaning " big hat " , while the name Nuevo Rico was a pun on nouveau riche and the name of the Nuevo Rican capital city , <unk> , was a pun on sans <unk> , meaning " without manners " . Hergé 's character Basil <unk> , of the <unk> Arms Company Ltd ( Basil <unk> in the 1937 edition ) , was a thinly veiled allusion to the real @-@ life Greek weapons seller Basil Zaharoff of Vickers Armstrong , who profited from the conflict by supplying arms to both Paraguay and Bolivia . Hergé had learned about the conflict and the western corporations profiting from it through two issues of anti @-@ conformist Belgian magazine La Crapouillot ( The Mortar Shell ) , which covered news stories ignored by the mainstream media . It is also likely that he had read Richard <unk> 's 1930 book Zaharoff , l <unk> <unk> ( Zaharoff , the Mysterious European ) , which had been referenced in La Crapouillot . 
 Hergé 's Arumbaya fetish was based on the design of a genuine Peruvian statue in Brussels ' Royal Museums of Art and History ; a pre @-@ Columbian <unk> statue , it was made of wood and dated to between 1200 and 1438 CE . Whereas Hergé had access to speakers of Mandarin when creating The Blue Lotus , he had no access to speakers of indigenous Amerindian languages , and as such , the Arumbaya language that he developed was entirely fictitious . He based its structure largely on the <unk> dialect spoken in the <unk> area of Brussels , mixed with Spanish endings and constructions . In developing the Arumbaya 's rivals , the <unk> , he was influenced by anthropological accounts of head shrinking among the <unk> tribes ; when Leslie Lonsdale @-@ Cooper and Michael Turner translated the book into English , they renamed the <unk> as the <unk> , a pun on the rum baba pudding . In crafting the story , Hergé was possibly influenced by The Maltese Falcon , as there are similarities in their plots . 
 = = = Original publication = = = 
 The Broken Ear was first serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from December 1935 under the title Tintin et Milou chez les Arumbayas ( Tintin and Snowy among the Arumbayas ) . From 7 February 1937 , the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper , Cœurs Vaillants . In 1937 , it was collected in a single hardcover volume and published by Éditions Casterman under the title L 'Oreille cassée ( The Broken Ear ) . For this collected edition , one small change was made ; the minor character of <unk> was renamed <unk> , because the word <unk> is Spanish slang for penis . 
 The Broken Ear introduced the character General Alcazar to the series , who went on to become a recurring character who appeared in three further Adventures . It was the first in the series to begin and end in Belgium , the first to deal with the hunt for a specific object , and the last in which Tintin is seen taking part in journalistic activity . It was also the first time that the Adventures featured Tintin 's flat at 26 Labrador Road , in which Chinese mementos from The Blue Lotus are visible . Influenced by the films of Alfred Hitchcock , Hergé inserted an illustration of himself into the second frame . He also made reference to contemporary news stories in the book , having a radio announcer discuss the ongoing Second Italo @-@ Ethiopian War at the start of the story ; this was removed in the colour edition . At the end of the story , Hergé killed off Ramón and Alonso and depicted them being dragged to Hell by devils ; the killing of the story 's antagonists was something not repeated in future stories . This upset the editors of Cœurs Vaillants , who asked Hergé to change the scene ; annoyed at their request , he later commented , " On the surface it cost me nothing , but that kind of addition was really difficult for me . " For their serialisation of the story , he replaced that particular frame with one in which Tintin vouchsafed the souls of Ramón and Alonso for God .

 In the 1940s and 1950s , when Hergé 's popularity had increased , he and his team at Studios Hergé redrew and coloured many of the original black @-@ and @-@ white Tintin adventures using the ligne claire ( " clear line " ) drawing style he had developed so that they visually fitted in with the new Tintin stories being created . The Broken Ear was the first of these early Adventures to undergo the reformatting and colouration , and this second edition was published as a 62 @-@ page volume by Casterman in 1943 . Unlike some of the earlier adventures , The Broken Ear was not redrawn , save for a few minor revisions . To reduce the length of the book , various sections were excised , including a dream sequence that appeared in the original . As the colouration process was new to the series , the use of colour in The Broken Ear is more basic than in later volumes ; as the book progresses , it is evident that Hergé lost interest and rushed the task , for instance , resorting to using block colour backgrounds without any detail . 
 = = = Later publications and legacy = = = 
 Casterman republished the original black @-@ and @-@ white version in 1979 in a French @-@ language collected volume with Cigars of the Pharaoh and The Blue Lotus , the second part of the Archives Hergé collection . In 1986 , Casterman published a facsimile version of the original . 
 Hergé returned to creating fictional nations as allusions to real countries in subsequent Adventures , such as Syldavia and Borduria ( based largely on Yugoslavia and Nazi Germany ) in King Ottokar 's Sceptre and <unk> ( based on Indonesia ) in Flight 714 to Sydney . He also re @-@ used other elements pioneered in The Broken Ear in his later Adventures : a parrot in The Castafiore Emerald , a ravine crash in The Calculus Affair , a fireball and vivid dream in The Seven Crystal Balls , and a firing squad in Tintin and the Picaros . Tintin returned to San Theodores in Tintin in the Picaros , in which the characters Pablo and Ridgewell also made a reappearance . 
 In 1979 , the Palace of Fine Arts in Brussels held an exhibition marking fifty years of The Adventures of Tintin . As part of this , they included artefacts that featured in the series , with the broken @-@ eared Peruvian statue that inspired Hergé 's Arumbaya fetish as the centre piece of the show ; however , they feared that it might be stolen , so a replica was exhibited rather than the genuine article . Imitating the events of The Broken Ear , a thief broke in and stole the statue . A letter was then sent to Le Soir in which an individual alleging to be the thief stated that the item would be returned if Hergé returned to the scene of the crime at a certain time with a copy of the book under his right arm . Hergé did so , but carried the book under his left arm ; the thief never appeared , and the replica fetish was never recovered . 
 = = Critical analysis = = 
 Jean @-@ Marc and Randy Lofficier described The Broken Ear as " a Blue Lotus @-@ lite " , noting that it shared many elements with the previous Adventure , although they also considered it to be " more reminiscent of the earlier , more caricatured books " like Tintin in the Congo and Tintin in America with the inclusion of comical natives and absurdist elements like " comical bombs " . They nevertheless thought that it exhibited a " marked improvement " in Hergé 's use of plotting , noting that the story was clearly structured , praising the " very effective , dramatic story , with plenty of twists " . Overall , they awarded The Broken Ear two stars out of five . Harry Thompson felt that The Broken Ear had a " slightly lacklustre quality " to it , and was " disappointing " due to the fact that the " various elements don 't gel well together . " He believed that the artistic quality and the use of research deteriorated as the Adventure progressed , although it had " the most complex plot yet , by a long way " . Philippe Goddin asserted that in the story , Tintin develops from a " classic reporter to an investigative journalist . " 
 Michael Farr described The Broken Ear as a " moral condemnation of capitalism , imperialism and war " , although felt that it was " not as perfectly constructed " as The Blue Lotus , being " less detailed and realistic " . He thought that the image in which Ramón and Alonso drown in the sea and are dragged to Hell by demons was " truly medieval " and represented the " most fanciful image " in the entire series . He also opined that Hergé 's depiction of South American military juntas was " full of humour " and that the detail was " generally very accurate " . Biographer Benoît Peeters thought that The Broken Ear was a return to " pure adventure " from the " quasi @-@ documentary realism " of The Blue Lotus , and that in this Adventure , politics remains " in the second line " , and that instead Hergé let " the narrative rip and succeeds marvellously . " Elsewhere , he praised the work as having a " formidable dynamism " and an " unequaled vitality " , containing a " revolution " in narrative structure . He thought that it served as a " perfect metaphor " for the theories of German philosopher Walter Benjamin published in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction ( 1936 ) , which Hergé had not read . Literary critic Tom McCarthy thought that Balthazar was an example of the interesting minor characters that imbue the Adventures , commenting that his " down @-@ at @-@ heel garret speaks volumes of loneliness and semi @-@ realised artistry . " He also opined that the diamond within the fetish was the clitoris of the Arumbaya , describing it as " their pleasure , wrapped up in a fetish " . He also thought that there was a homosexual subtext between Ramón and Alonso , believing that the scene in which a bullet was fired into Ramón 's buttocks was symbolic of anal sex . 
 Writing in Libération , the philosopher Michel Serres opined that The Broken Ear was " a treatise on fetishism " . Literary critic Jean @-@ Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University believed that The Broken Ear established a " <unk> " anthropology that would remain throughout the rest of the series . As part of this , Apostolidès argued , Hergé distances himself from western values and looks at his own society as an outsider , accomplishing what Roger <unk> called " sociological revolution " . He felt that the comic was " more contrived " and " more superficial " than the previous Adventures , and that here Tintin loses his position as " the sole point of identification " for the reader , with the other characters becoming more identifiable . Opining that there was a constant theme of twos throughout the story ( i.e. the real and the fake fetish , Alonso and Ramón ) , he thought that the character of Ridgewell was " a kind of Tintin , grown old among the natives , solitary and ill humored " , noting that Ridgewell 's position among the Arumbayas was akin to Tintin 's position among the Ba <unk> in Congo . Apostolidès also argued that in the comic , Alcazar was a religious figure , who attained a " sacred " quality through the spilling of blood in his revolt against General Tapioca 's government . As part of this , he argued that the threats of assassination would make him a martyr , or a " holy king . "

 Robert Watson " Bob " Schmertz ( March 4 , 1898 – June 7 , 1975 ) was a Pittsburgh @-@ based architect and folk musician whose music has been covered by Pete Seeger , Burl Ives , Tennessee Ernie Ford , Bill and Gloria Gaither , The Statler Brothers , The Cathedrals , Dailey & Vincent , the River City Brass Band , and Ernie Haase & Signature Sound . Born in Squirrel Hill , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , Schmertz attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology , where he wrote the Carnegie Tartans ' fight song , " Fight for the Glory of Carnegie , " and played the banjo in a jazz orchestra ; after he graduated with an architecture degree in 1921 , Schmertz designed buildings . He taught at Carnegie for more than thirty @-@ five years before his retirement . 
 As a folk musician , Schmertz released four albums , with his third , Sing Oh !

 Schmertz was born on March 4 , 1898 , in Squirrel Hill , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . After he completed studies at Peabody High School , where he met his future wife , Mildred , Schmertz attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology ( today , Carnegie Mellon University ) . In May 1917 Schmertz , dressed in " light flannel trousers , a girl 's <unk> blouse and a small white hat , " was arrested after he stood outside a theater and encouraged persons exiting the theater to join the navy as , according to Schmertz , a part of an initiation ritual to join a fraternity ; he was charged with mocking the uniform but a magistrate later dismissed the charge . 
 At Carnegie , Schmertz wrote the Carnegie Tartans ' fight song , " Fight for the Glory of Carnegie " , wrote college musicals , led a dance band , played the banjo in a jazz orchestra , and worked on the Carnegie yearbook staff . In 1921 , he graduated with a degree in architecture . 
 = = Architecture and professorship = = 
 As an architect , Schmertz designed the St. Michael 's of the Valley Church in Rector , Pennsylvania , and the renovation of the Unity Chapel in Latrobe , Pennsylvania . In 1930 , the Common Brick Manufacturers ' Association of America in Cleveland , Ohio , awarded Schmertz an honorable mention in a " houses already built " contest . Three years later , Schmertz served on a Pittsburgh @-@ based American Institute of Architects executive committee that sought to identify western Pennsylvanian buildings constructed before 1860 . Schmertz worked as a member of Fisher and Schmertz , and , later , headed the firm of Schmertz , Erwin and Associates . According to George <unk> of The Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine , " many " of the buildings Schmertz designed were homes . 
 Schmertz taught design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology for more than thirty @-@ five years . At Carnegie , Schmertz worked on a team that designed a cyclotron for the university in <unk> , Pennsylvania . Schmertz retired from his professorship in 1965 ( named a professor emeritus ) , but was teaching at the university in 1973 .

 In 1949 , Schmertz , who played the banjo in college , recorded an LP , Songs by Robert Schmertz , after his friends bought him studio time . Schmertz 's second studio album , Robert Schmertz Sings His Songs , was released in 1955 : from the album , Burl Ives covered " Angus <unk> McTavish Dundee " on the Captain Kangaroo show . 
 By 1958 , a writer for the Deadwood Pioneer @-@ Times in Deadwood , South Dakota , wrote that Schmertz was " rapidly gaining national prominence as an interpreter of American musical and lyrical idiom " after Schmertz wrote a song , " Swing Away , Pearly Gates , " for Edmund Karlsrud and the <unk> , who performed it as a part of their 1957 – 1958 tour . In 1958 , composer Elie <unk> and lyricist Edward <unk> cited Schmertz 's " Monongahela Sal " and " Lock No . Ten " as inspiration for The Mermaid in Lock No. 7 , a musical " in the folk idiom , expanded by modern , sophisticated treatment " that debuted at the American Wind Symphony Orchestra . 
 Schmertz 's third album , Sing Oh ! the City Oh ! : Songs of Early Pittsburgh , released on Folkways Records in 1959 , featured folk songs , such as " <unk> " , named after Pierre Joseph <unk> de Blainville , and " The Battle of Bushy Run " , after the battle of the same name , in commemoration of the bicentennial of Pittsburgh 's founding . A reviewer for Keystone Folklore Quarterly described the album , to which two of his children , Gretchen Schmertz Jacob and John Schmertz , contributed , as " tuneful and well @-@ done in the folk tradition " . A reviewer for Billboard magazine called it a " fascinating package of songs " that " will appeal to folklorists , educational groups , and , of course , residents of Pittsburgh particularly " . Schmertz released his final album , Ladies Beware of an Architect : Songs for Architects and Their Girlfriends , in 1960 . 
 Schmertz 's music has been covered by Pete Seeger , who called Schmertz a " very good songwriter " , Burl Ives , Tennessee Ernie Ford , Bill and Gloria Gaither , The Statler Brothers , The Cathedrals , Dailey & Vincent , the River City Brass Band , and Ernie Haase & Signature Sound .

 Before his death , Schmertz compiled a book on his songs , though he died before it published . Ten days prior to his death , Schmertz sustained a stroke , and , on June 7 , 1975 , died after a long illness . 
 = International airport = 
 An international airport is an airport that offers customs and immigration facilities for passengers travelling between countries . International airports are typically larger than domestic airports and often feature longer runways and facilities to accommodate the heavier aircraft commonly used for international and intercontinental travel . International airports often also host domestic flights . Some , such as Frankfurt Airport in Germany are very large ; others such as Fa <unk> International Airport in Tahiti , are quite small . 
 Buildings , operations and management have become increasingly sophisticated since the mid 20th century , when international airports began to provide infrastructure for international civilian flights . Detailed technical standards have been developed to ensure safety and common coding systems implemented to provide global consistency . The physical structures that serve millions of individual passengers and flights are among the most complex and interconnected in the world . By the second decade of the 21st century , there were over 1 @,@ 200 international airports and almost two billion international passengers along with 50 million metric tonnes of cargo were passing through them annually . 
 = = History = = 
 In August 1919 , Hounslow Heath Aerodrome , in London , England was the first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services . It was closed and supplanted by Croydon Airport in March 1920 . In the United States , Bisbee @-@ Douglas International Airport in Arizona became the first international airport of the Americas in 1928 . 
 The precursors to international airports were airfields or aerodromes . In the early days of international flights , there was limited infrastructure , " although if engine problems arose there were plenty of places where aircraft could land " . Four @-@ engined land planes being unavailable for over @-@ water operations to international destinations , thus / therefore flying boats became part of the solution . At the far end of the longest international route ( which became the Kangaroo Route ) , on @-@ water landing areas were found in places such as Surabaya and in the open sea off Kupang . In Sydney , Rose Bay , New South Wales , was chosen as the airport landing area . 
 International airports sometimes serve military as well as commercial purposes and their viability is also affected by technological developments . Canton Island Airport , for example , in the Phoenix Islands ( Kiribati ) , after serving as a military airport during World War II , was used as a refuelling stop by commercial aircraft such as Qantas which stationed ground crew there in the late 1950s . The advent in the early 1960s of jet aircraft such as the Boeing 707 with the range to fly non @-@ stop between Australia or New Zealand and Hawaii , meant that a mid @-@ Pacific stop was no longer needed and the airport was closed to regular commercial use . Other international airports , such as Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong , have been decommissioned and replaced when they reached capacity or technological advances rendered them inadequate . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The construction and operation of an international airport depends on a complicated set of decisions that are affected by technology , politics , economics and geography as well as both local and international law . Designing an airport even for domestic traffic or as " non @-@ hub " has , from the beginning , required extensive co @-@ ordination between users and interested parties – architects , engineers , managers and staff all need to be involved . Airports may also be regarded as emblematic of national pride and so the design may be architecturally ambitious . An example is the planned New Mexico City international airport , intended to replace an airport that has reached capacity . 
 Airports can be towered or non @-@ towered , depending on air traffic density and available funds . Because of high capacity and busy airspace , many international airports have air traffic control located on site . 
 Some international airports require construction of additional infrastructure outside of the airport , such as at the Hong Kong International Airport , which included the construction of a high @-@ speed railway and automobile expressway to connect the airport to the urban areas of Hong Kong . Construction of the expressway included the construction of two bridges ( the Tsing Ma suspension bridge and Kap Shui Mun cable bridge ) and the Ma Wan viaduct on Ma Wan island to connect the bridges . Each bridge carries rail and automobile traffic . 
 = = Operations and management = = 
 International airports have commercial relationships with and provide services to airlines and passengers from around the world . Many also serve as hubs , or places where non @-@ direct flights may land and passengers may switch planes , while others serve primarily direct point @-@ to @-@ point flights . This affects airport design factors , including the number and placement of terminals as well as the flow of passengers and baggage between different areas of the airport . An airport specializing in point @-@ to @-@ point transit can have international and domestic terminals , each in their separate building equipped with separate baggage handling facilities . In a hub airport , however , spaces and services are shared . 
 Airport management have to take into account a wide range of factors , among which are the performance of airlines , the technical requirements of aircraft , airport @-@ airline relationships , services for travelling customers , security and environmental impacts . 
 = = = Standards = = = 
 Technical standards for safety and operating procedures at international airports are set by international agreements . The International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) , formed in 1945 , is the association of the airline companies . The International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) is a body of the United Nations succeeding earlier international committees going back to 1903 . These two organizations served to create regulations over airports which the airports themselves had no authority to debate . This eventually sparked an entire subject of air travel politics . In January 1948 , 19 representatives from various US commercial airports met for the first time in New York City to seek resolution to common problems they each faced , which initiated the formation of the Airport Operators Council , which later became Airports Council International – North America ( ACI @-@ NA ) . This group included representatives from Baltimore , Boston , Chicago , Cleveland , Dallas , Denver , Detroit , Jacksonville , Kansas City , Los Angeles , Memphis , Miami , Minneapolis @-@ St. Paul , New York @-@ Newark , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , St. Louis , San Francisco and Washington . 
 = = = Flight logistics = = = 
 International airports have extensive operations in managing flight logistics , such as air traffic control . The latter service is provided by ground @-@ based controllers who coordinate and direct aircraft on the ground and through controlled airspace . Air traffic control also provides advisory services to aircraft in non @-@ controlled airspace . 
 = = = Customs and immigration = = = 
 Airports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities , which allow right of entry . These change over time but are generally designated by law . However , as some countries have agreements that allow connecting flights without customs and immigrations , such facilities do not define an international airport . 
 = = = Security and safety = = = 
 The current trend of enhancing security at the cost of passenger and baggage handling efficiency at international airports is expected to continue in the future . This places financial burden on airports , risks the flow of servicing processes , and has implications for the privacy of passengers . International flights often require a higher level of physical security than do domestic airports , although in recent years , many countries have adopted the same level of security for both . 
 Most international airports feature a " sterile lounge " , an area after security checkpoints within which passengers are free to move without further security checks . This area can have services such as duty @-@ free shops that sell goods that have been selected and screened with safety in mind , so that purchasing and bringing them on board flights poses no security risks . In addition to employees , only processed passengers with a valid ticket are allowed inside the sterile lounge . Admittance into the sterile area is done in centralized security checkpoints in contrast to e.g. individual checkpoints at each gate . This allows for more efficient processing of passengers with fewer staff , as well as makes it possible to detect both delays and security threats well ahead of boarding . 
 To ensure the viability of airport operations , new and innovative security systems are being developed . For instance , the old security checkpoints can be replaced by a " total security area " encompassing an entire airport , coupled with automatic surveillance of passengers from the moment they enter the airport until they embark on a plane . 
 Passengers connecting to domestic flights from an international flight generally must take their checked luggage through customs and re @-@ check their luggage at the domestic airline counter , requiring extra time in the process . In some cases in Europe , luggage can be transferred to the final destination even if it is a domestic connection . 
 In some cases , travelers and the aircraft can clear customs and immigration at the departure airport . As one example of this , are airports in Canada with United States border preclearance facilities . This allows flights from those airports to fly into US airports that do not have customs and immigration facilities . Luggage from such flights can also be transferred to a final destination in the U.S. through the airport of entry . 
 A crucial safety aspect of international airports is medical facilities and practices . In particular , controlling transmissible disease , such as SARS , is deemed important at international airports . While these standards are regulated by ICAO Standards And Recommended Practices ( <unk> ) and WHO 's International Health Regulations ( IHR ) , local authorities have considerable say in how they are implemented . 
 = = = Transportation = = = 
 Among the most important airport services are further transportation connections , including rail networks , taxi and shuttle services at curbside pick @-@ up areas , and public buses . Large areas for automobile parking , often in co @-@ located multi @-@ storey car parks , are also typical to find at airports . Some airports provide shuttle services to parking garages for passengers and airport employees . Due to the very large scale of international airports , some have constructed shuttle services to transport passengers between terminals . Such systems operate for example , in Singapore Changi Airport and Zurich Airport . 
 At some U.S. international airports , such as O 'Hare International Airport in Chicago , some seating and waiting areas are located away from the terminal building , with passengers being shuttled to terminals . These areas may be referred to as ground transportation centers or intermodal centers . Amenities at ground transportation centers typically include restrooms and seating , and may also provide ticket counters , food and beverage sales and retail goods such as magazines . Some ground transportation centers have heating and air conditioning and covered boarding areas ( to protect passengers from the elements ) .

 Standard amenities include public restrooms , passenger waiting areas and retail stores for dining and shopping , including duty @-@ free shops . Dining establishments may be consolidated in food courts . Some international airports may offer retail sales of luxury goods at duty @-@ free stores , such as at Terminal 3 at Indira Gandhi International Airport in India . This terminal has been described as having become a significant retail destination in India . Wi @-@ Fi service and access , offices for bureau de change ( currency exchange ) and tourism advice are common , although the availability of service varies across airports . Some international airports provide secure areas for stranded passengers to rest and sleep . The more usual service is hotels that are available on the premises .

 Toponymy is one of the most common sources for the naming of airports . A number of areas close to them have lent their names , including villages , estates , city districts , historical areas and regions , islands and even a waterfall . <unk> del <unk> International Airport and Foz do <unk> International Airport are named after the Iguazu Falls in Argentina . Domodedovo International Airport is named after the town of Domodedovo . Sometimes the toponym is combined with or renamed to incorporate another name from another source such as from one of the following : 
 Aviators , such as pilots ( civil and military ) and others who played a role in the development of aviation . Sydney Airport is also known as Kingsford Smith Airport , named after Charles Kingsford Smith ; and Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport , in Chile , is named after Arturo Merino Benítez . 
 Cultural leaders ( poets , artists , writers , musicians ) such as Leonardo da Vinci – Fiumicino Airport , named after Leonardo da Vinci ; Liverpool John Lennon Airport , named after The Beatles member and Liverpool local John Lennon ; Tom Jobim Airport , at Rio de Janeiro named after the composer Antonio Carlos Jobim . Václav Havel Airport Prague , named after writer / philosopher / statesman Václav Havel . Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport and Warsaw Chopin Airport were both renamed after musicians , the former after Franz Liszt on the 200th anniversary of his birth and the latter after Frédéric Chopin .

 = Gospel of the Ebionites = 
 The Gospel of the Ebionites is the conventional name given by scholars to an apocryphal gospel extant only as seven brief quotations in a <unk> known as the Panarion , by Epiphanius of Salamis ; he misidentified it as the " Hebrew " gospel , believing it to be a truncated and modified version of the Gospel of Matthew . The quotations were embedded in a polemic to point out inconsistencies in the beliefs and practices of a Jewish Christian sect known as the Ebionites relative to Nicene orthodoxy . 
 The surviving fragments derive from a gospel harmony of the Synoptic Gospels , composed in Greek with various expansions and abridgments reflecting the theology of the writer . Distinctive features include the absence of the virgin birth and of the genealogy of Jesus ; an Adoptionist Christology , in which Jesus is chosen to be God 's Son at the time of his Baptism ; the abolition of the Jewish sacrifices by Jesus ; and an advocacy of vegetarianism . It is believed to have been composed some time during the middle of the 2nd century in or around the region east of the Jordan River . Although the gospel was said to be used by " Ebionites " during the time of the early church , the identity of the group or groups that used it remains a matter of conjecture . 
 The Gospel of the Ebionites is one of several Jewish – Christian gospels , along with the Gospel of the Hebrews and the Gospel of the Nazarenes ; all survive only as fragments in quotations of the early Church Fathers . Due to their fragmentary state , the relationships , if any , between the Jewish – Christian gospels and a hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel are uncertain and have been a subject of intensive scholarly investigation . The Ebionite gospel has been recognized as distinct from the others , and it has been identified more closely with the lost Gospel of the Twelve . It shows no dependence on the Gospel of John and is similar in nature to the harmonized gospel sayings based on the Synoptic Gospels used by Justin Martyr , although a relationship between them , if any , is uncertain . There is a similarity between the gospel and a source document contained within the Clementine Recognitions ( 1 @.@ 27 – 71 ) , conventionally referred to by scholars as the Ascents of James , with respect to the command to abolish the Jewish sacrifices . 
 = = Background = = 
 Epiphanius is believed to have come into possession of a gospel that he attributed to the Ebionites when he was bishop of Salamis , Cyprus . He alone among the Church Fathers identifies Cyprus as one of the " roots " of the Ebionites . The gospel survives only in seven brief quotations by Epiphanius in Chapter 30 of his <unk> the Panarion , or " Medicine Chest " , ( c . 377 ) as a polemic against the Ebionites . His citations are often contradictory and thought to be based in part on his own conjecture . The various , sometimes conflicting , sources of information were combined to point out inconsistencies in Ebionite beliefs and practices relative to Nicene orthodoxy , possibly to serve , indirectly , as a polemic against the Arians of his time . 
 The term Gospel of the Ebionites is a modern convention ; no surviving document of the early church mentions a gospel by that name . Epiphanius identifies the gospel only as " in the Gospel used by them , called ' according to Matthew ' " and " they call it ' the Hebrew [ gospel ] ' " . As early as 1689 the French priest Richard Simon called the text " Gospel of the Ebionites " . The name is used by modern scholars as a convenient way to distinguish a gospel text that was probably used by the Ebionites from Epiphanius ' mistaken belief that it was a Hebrew version of the Gospel of Matthew . Its place of origin is uncertain ; one speculation is that it was composed in the region east of the Jordan where the Ebionites were said to have been present , according to the accounts of the Church Fathers . It is thought to have been composed during the middle of the 2nd century , since several other gospel harmonies are known to be from this period . 
 = = Composition = = 
 According to scholars Oskar <unk> and Glenn Alan Koch , Epiphanius incorporated excerpts from the gospel text at a late stage in the composition of Panarion 30 , primarily in chapters 13 and 14 As Epiphanius describes it , " The Gospel which is found among them ... is not complete , but falsified and distorted ... " ( 13 @.@ 1 – 2 ) . In particular , it lacked some or all of the first two chapters of Matthew , which contain the infancy narrative of the virgin birth of Jesus and the Davidic genealogy via Solomon , " They have removed the genealogies of Matthew ... " ( 14 @.@ 2 – 3 ) . 
 There is general agreement about the seven quotations by Epiphanius cited in the critical edition of " Jewish Christian gospels " by Philipp Vielhauer and Georg Strecker , translated by George Ogg , in <unk> 's New Testament Apocrypha . The translations of Bernhard Pick ( 1908 ) , with the sequence of four fragments arranged in the order of Vielhauer & Strecker from the beginning of the gospel are as follows : 
 It came to pass in the days of Herod , King of Judaea under the high priest Caiaphas , that John came and baptized with the baptism of repentance in the river Jordan ; he is said to be from the tribe of Aaron and a son of Zacharias the priest and of Elizabeth and all went out to him . ( 13 @.@ 6 ) And it came to pass when John baptized , that the Pharisees came to him and were baptized , and all Jerusalem also . He had a garment of camels ' hair , and a leather girdle about his loins . And his meat was wild honey , which tasted like manna , formed like cakes of oil . ( 13 @.@ 4 ) The people having been baptized , Jesus came also , and was baptized by John . And as he came out of the water the heavens opened , and he saw the Holy Spirit descending under the form of a dove , and entering into him . And a voice was heard from heaven : ' Thou art my beloved Son , and in thee am I well pleased ' . And again : ' This day have I begotten thee ' . And suddenly shone a great light in that place . And John seeing him , said , ' Who art thou , Lord ' ? Then a voice was heard from heaven : ' This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased ' . <unk> John fell at his feet and said : ' I pray thee , Lord , baptize me ' . But he would not , saying ' Suffer it , for so it <unk> that all should be accomplished ' . ( 13 @.@ 7 ) 
 " There was a man named Jesus , and he was about thirty years old ; he has chosen us . And He came into Capernaum and entered into the house of Simon , surnamed Peter , and He opened His mouth and said , ' As I walked by the Sea of Tiberias , I chose John and James , the sons of Zebedee , and Simon and Andrew and <unk> and Simon <unk> , and Judas Iscariot ; thee also , Matthew , when thou wast sitting at the receipt of custom , did I call and thou didst follow me . According to my intention ye shall be twelve apostles for a testimony unto Israel ' . " ( <unk> – 3 ) 
 The three quotations by Epiphanius in Panarion 30 @.@ 13 @.@ 6 , 4 , and 7 , respectively , form the opening of the gospel narrative , including the mission of John the Baptist , his appearance and diet , and the baptism of Jesus by John . The beginning of the gospel ( 13 @.@ 6 ) has parallels to the Gospel of Luke but in abbreviated form . The text shows a familiarity with the infancy narrative of Luke 1 : 5 despite lacking a birth narrative of its own . Quoting from the text regarding the diet of John ( 13 @.@ 4 ) , Epiphanius complains that the Ebionites have falsified the text by substituting the word " cake " ( <unk> <unk> ) for " locust " ( <unk> <unk> , in Matthew 3 : 4 ) . The similarity of the wording in Greek has led scholars to conclude that Greek was the original language of composition . In the narrative of the baptism of Jesus by John ( 13 @.@ 7 ) , the voice of God speaks three times in close parallels to the Gospel of Mark 1 : 11 , Luke 3 : 23 ( Western text @-@ type ) , and Matthew 3 : 17 , respectively . The presence of multiple baptismal <unk> has led to a consensus among modern scholars that the text quoted by Epiphanius is a gospel harmony of the Synoptic Gospels . The appearance of a great light on the water may be an echo of St. Paul 's conversion or an additional harmonization of the Gospel of the Hebrews to this work . 
 Epiphanius begins his description of the gospel text ( <unk> – 3 ) with a quotation which has the apostle Matthew narrating directly to the reader . Jesus recalls how the twelve apostles were chosen and addresses Matthew in the second person as " you also Matthew " . Although twelve apostles are mentioned , only eight are named . They are said to be chosen by Jesus , " for a testimony to Israel " . The phrase " who chose us " has been interpreted as evidence that the text may be the lost Gospel of the Twelve mentioned by Origen . However , the identification of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius with this otherwise unknown gospel is disputed . The position of this quotation was tentatively assigned based on a parallel to the Synoptic Gospels . 
 The fifth and sixth quotations ( following Vielhauer & Strecker 's order ) are associated with a Christological controversy . The polemics of Epiphanius along with his quotations of the gospel text ( in italics ) are shown in parallel : 
 " Moreover they deny that he was a man , evidently on the ground of the word which the Savior spoke when it was reported to him : ' Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without ' , namely : ' Who is my mother and who are my brethren ' ? And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples and said : ' These are my brethren and mother and sisters , which do the will of my Father ' . " ( 14 @.@ 5 ) 
 " They say that he was not begotten of God the Father , but created as one of the archangels ... that he rules over the angels and all the creatures of the Almighty , and that he came and declared , as their Gospel , which is called according to the Hebrews , reports : ' I am come to abolish the sacrifices , if ye cease not from sacrificing , the wrath will not cease from you ' . " ( 16 @.@ 4 – 5 ) 
 The fifth quotation ( 14 @.@ 5 ) appears to be a harmony of Matthew 12 : 47 – 48 and its Synoptic parallels . However , Jesus ' final proclamation shows a closer agreement to 2 Clement 9 : 11 than any of the Synoptics . The unity of this quotation with the gospel text in Chapter 13 has been questioned . The command to abolish the sacrifices in the sixth quotation ( 16 @.@ 5 ) is unparalleled in the Canonical Gospels , and it suggests a relationship to Matthew 5 : 17 ( " I did not come to abolish the Law " ) that is echoed in the Clementine literature . 
 Referring to a parallel passage in Luke 22 : 15 , Epiphanius complains that the Ebionites have again falsified the gospel text : 
 " They destroyed the true order and changed the passage ... they made the disciples say , ' Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the Passover ' ? To which He replied : ' I have no desire to eat the flesh of this Paschal Lamb with you ' . " ( 22 @.@ 4 ) 
 thereby making Jesus declare that he would not eat meat during the Passover . The immediate context suggests the possible attribution of the quotation to a Clementine source ; however a linkage between the gospel fragments and the Clementine literature remains uncertain . 
 = = Christology = = 
 The baptismal scene of the gospel text ( 13 @.@ 7 ) is a harmony of the Synoptic Gospels , but one in which the Holy Spirit is said to descend to Jesus in the form of a dove and enter into him . This divine election at the time of his baptism is known as an Adoptionist Christology , and it is emphasized by the quotation of Psalm 2 : 7 , as found in the " Western text " of Luke 3 : 22 , " You are my son , this day I have begotten you . " The Spirit entering into Jesus and the great light on the water are thought to be based on the prophecies of Isaiah 61 : 1 and 9 : 1 , respectively . His Adoptionist son @-@ ship is characterized by the belief that Jesus was a mere man , who , by virtue of his perfect righteousness , was imbued with the divinity of the eternal Christ through his Baptism in order to carry out the prophetic task for which he had been chosen . 
 The absence of any reference to a Davidic son @-@ ship in the gospel text suggests that Jesus has been elected to be the end @-@ time prophet , the Chosen One , sent to abolish the Jewish sacrifices . The Prophet @-@ Christology of the gospel text quoted by Epiphanius is more at home with the Clementine literature than the Christology of the Ebionites known to Irenaeus . According to scholars Richard <unk> and Petri <unk> , Jesus is understood in this gospel as having come to abolish the sacrifices rather than substituting for them ; thus it is unlikely that it contained the same institution of the Eucharist as practiced by Nicene orthodox Christianity . However , scholars have yet to reach a consensus over the sacrificial significance of Jesus ' mission as depicted in the Ebionite gospel . 
 = = Vegetarianism = = 
 The change in wording of the gospel text from " locust " ( <unk> ) to " cake " ( <unk> ) for John the Baptist 's diet ( 13 @.@ 4 ) has been interpreted as evidence of Jewish vegetarianism . However , the association of the diet of John the Baptist with vegetarianism has been questioned . Epiphanius gives no indication of concern for vegetarianism in this part of the Gospel text , and it may instead be an allusion to the manna in the wilderness of Exodus 16 : 31 and Numbers 11 : 8 , or , according to scholar Glenn Alan Koch , to 1 Kings 19 : 6 where Elijah eats cakes in oil . 
 Further evidence has been found in the quotation based on Luke 22 : 15 ( 22 @.@ 4 ) , where the saying has been modified by insertion of the word " flesh " to provide a rationale for vegetarianism . The immediate context of the quotation suggests that it may be closely related to a Clementine source , the Journeys of Peter . Reading from the same source , Epiphanius states that the Ebionites abstained from " meat with soul in it " ( 15 @.@ 3 ) , and he attributes this teaching to Ebionite interpolations " they corrupt the contents and leave a few genuine items " . Due to the close association of this saying with the Clementine literature of the 3rd and 4th century , the earlier practice of vegetarianism by the 2nd @-@ century Ebionites known to Irenaeus has been questioned . The strict vegetarianism of the Ebionites known to Epiphanius may have been a reaction to the cessation of Jewish sacrifices and a safeguard against the consumption of unclean meat in a pagan environment . 
 = = Relationship to other texts = = 
 Epiphanius incorrectly refers to the gospel in his possession as the Gospel of Matthew and the gospel " according to the Hebrews " , perhaps relying upon and conflating the writings of the earlier Church Fathers , Irenaeus and Eusebius , respectively . His 4th century colleague Jerome remarks that the Nazarenes and Ebionites both used the Gospel of the Hebrews , which was considered the original Matthew by many of them . Jerome 's report is consistent with the prior accounts of Irenaeus and Eusebius . 
 The relationship between the Gospel of the Ebionites , the Gospel of the Hebrews , and the Gospel of the Nazarenes remains unclear . All the Jewish – Christian gospels survive only as fragments in quotations , so it is difficult to tell if they are independent texts or variations of each other . Scholar Albertus <unk> established the modern consensus , concluding that the gospel harmony composed in Greek appears to be a distinctive text known only to Epiphanius . Scholar Marie @-@ Émile <unk> has claimed the Ebionite gospel is partly dependent upon a hypothetical Hebrew gospel as a source ; however this conjecture remains a minority view . Its putative relationship to the gospel text known to Origen as the Gospel of the Twelve remains a subject of scholarly debate . 
 The Ebionite gospel is one example of a type of gospel harmony that used the Gospel of Matthew as a base text but did not include the Gospel of John ; it is believed to pre @-@ date <unk> 's Diatessaron ( c . 170 ) which included all four canonical gospels . The gospel has a parallel to a quotation in a mid @-@ 2nd @-@ century homily known as 2 Clement , suggesting that both may be dependent on a harmonizing tradition from an earlier 2nd century source . The harmonized gospel sayings sources used by Justin Martyr to compose his First Apology and Dialogue with <unk> were similarly based on the Synoptic Gospels . According to scholar George Howard , harmonization was a widely used method of composition in the early Patristic period . Many of the heterodox variants found in the Gospel of the Ebionites may have been adopted from a larger pool of variants that were in circulation ; an example is the appearance of a great light that shone during Jesus ' Baptism which is also found in the Diatessaron . 
 The Recognitions of Clement contains a source document ( Rec . 1 @.@ 27 – 71 ) , conventionally referred to by scholars as the Ascents of James , which is believed to be of Jewish – Christian origin . The Ascents shares a similarity to the Gospel of the Ebionites with regard to the baptism of the Pharisees by John ( Pan . 30 @.@ 13 @.@ 4 ; Rec . 1 @.@ 54 @.@ 6 – 7 ) and the command to abolish the Jewish sacrifices , adding that a Christian water baptism is to be substituted for the remission of sins . Based on these similarities , scholars Richard <unk> and F. Stanley Jones have postulated a direct dependence of the Ascents of James on the Gospel of the Ebionites . 
 = = <unk> about the Ebionites = = 
 The gospel Epiphanius attributed to the Ebionites is a valuable source of information that provides modern scholars with insights into the distinctive characteristics of a vanished branch of Jewish Christianity . However , scholars disagree on whether the information contained within the seven fragments preserved by Epiphanius accurately reflects the traditions of the second @-@ century Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus , or if their belief system changed , perhaps greatly , over a span of 200 years compared to this early group . The Ebionites known to Irenaeus ( first mentioned in Adversus <unk> 1 @.@ 26 @.@ 2 , written around 185 ) and other Church Fathers prior to Epiphanius were described as a Jewish sect that regarded Jesus as the Messiah but not as divine . They insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites and they used only the Jewish – Christian gospel . The Ebionites rejected the epistles of Paul of Tarsus , whom they regarded as an apostate from the Law . 
 In Epiphanius ' polemic against the Ebionites found in Panarion 30 , a complex picture emerges of the beliefs and practices of the 4th century Ebionites that cannot easily be separated from his method of combining together disparate sources . While scholars such as Hans @-@ Joachim Schoeps literally interpreted Epiphanius ' account as describing a later syncretic development of <unk> , more recent scholarship has found it difficult to reconcile his report with those of the earlier Church Fathers , leading to a conjecture by scholar Petri <unk> that a second group of Hellenistic @-@ Samaritan Ebionites may also have been present . The rejection of the Jewish sacrifices and the implication of an end @-@ time prophet Christology due to the lack of a birth narrative lend support for the association of the Gospel of the Ebionites with a group or groups different from the Ebionites known to Irenaeus . 
 Scholarship in the area of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on artificial constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian <unk> , with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology . This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail to take into account the <unk> of these groups , reflecting differences in geography , time periods in history , and ethnicity . With respect to Epiphanius , and the Ebionites in particular , insufficient attention has been paid to the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources , including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus . In the end , he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history . These gospel fragments offer one of the few glimpses into their world . 
 = Scouting = 
 Scouting or the Scout Movement is a movement that aims to support young people in their physical , mental and spiritual development , that they may play constructive roles in society , with a strong focus on the outdoors and survival skills . During the first half of the 20th century , the movement grew to encompass three major age groups for boys ( Cub Scout , Boy Scout , Rover Scout ) and , in 1910 , a new organization , Girl Guides , was created for girls ( Brownie Guide , Girl Guide and Girl Scout , Ranger Guide ) . It is one of several worldwide youth organizations . 
 In 1906 and 1907 Robert Baden @-@ Powell , a lieutenant general in the British Army , wrote a book for boys about reconnaissance and scouting . Baden @-@ Powell wrote Scouting for Boys ( London , 1908 ) , based on his earlier books about military scouting , with influence and support of Frederick Russell Burnham ( Chief of Scouts in British Africa ) , Ernest Thompson Seton of the Woodcraft Indians , William Alexander Smith of the Boys ' Brigade , and his publisher Pearson . In the summer of 1907 Baden @-@ Powell held a camp on Brownsea Island in England to test ideas for his book . This camp and the publication of Scouting for Boys are generally regarded as the start of the Scout movement . 
 The movement employs the Scout method , a programme of informal education with an emphasis on practical outdoor activities , including camping , woodcraft , aquatics , hiking , backpacking , and sports . Another widely recognized movement characteristic is the Scout uniform , by intent hiding all differences of social standing in a country and making for equality , with neckerchief and campaign hat or comparable headwear . Distinctive uniform insignia include the fleur @-@ de @-@ lis and the trefoil , as well as badges and other patches . 
 The two largest umbrella organizations are the World Organization of the Scout Movement ( WOSM ) , for boys @-@ only and co @-@ educational organizations , and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts ( WAGGGS ) , primarily for girls @-@ only organizations but also accepting co @-@ educational organizations . The year 2007 marked the centenary of Scouting worldwide , and member organizations planned events to celebrate the occasion . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 Scouting virtually started itself , but the trigger that set it going was the 1908 publication of Scouting for Boys written by Robert Baden @-@ Powell . At Charterhouse , one of England 's most famous public schools , Baden @-@ Powell had an interest in the outdoors . Later , as a military officer , Baden @-@ Powell was stationed in British India in the 1880s where he took an interest in military scouting and in 1884 he published Reconnaissance and Scouting . 
 In 1896 , Baden @-@ Powell was assigned to the Matabeleland region in Southern Rhodesia ( now Zimbabwe ) as Chief of Staff to Gen. Frederick Carrington during the Second Matabele War , and it was here ( in June , 1896 ) that he first met and began a lifelong friendship with Frederick Russell Burnham , the American @-@ born Chief of Scouts for the British Army in Africa . This was a formative experience for Baden @-@ Powell not only because he had the time of his life commanding reconnaissance missions into enemy territory , but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here . During their joint scouting patrols into the Matobo Hills , Burnham augmented Baden @-@ Powell 's woodcraft skills , inspiring him and sowing seeds for both the programme and for the code of honour later published in Scouting for Boys . <unk> by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas , woodcraft was generally little known to the British Army but well @-@ known to the American scout Burnham . These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft , the fundamentals of Scouting . Both men recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt ; so during their joint scouting missions , Baden @-@ Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men , rich in exploration , tracking , fieldcraft , and self @-@ reliance . It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden @-@ Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham , and it was here that Baden @-@ Powell acquired his <unk> horn , the Ndebele war instrument he later used every morning at Brownsea Island to wake the first Boy Scouts and to call them together in training courses . 
 Three years later , in South Africa during the Second Boer War , Baden @-@ Powell was besieged in the small town of Mafeking by a much larger Boer army ( the Siege of Mafeking ) . The Mafeking Cadet Corps was a group of youths that supported the troops by carrying messages , which freed the men for military duties and kept the boys occupied during the long siege . The Cadet Corps performed well , helping in the defense of the town ( 1899 – 1900 ) , and were one of the many factors that inspired Baden @-@ Powell to form the Scouting movement . Each member received a badge that illustrated a combined compass point and spearhead . The badge 's logo was similar to the fleur @-@ de @-@ lis shaped arrowhead that Scouting later adopted as its international symbol . The Siege of Mafeking was the first time since his own childhood that Baden @-@ Powell , a regular serving soldier , had come into the same orbit as " civilians " - women and children - and discovered for himself the usefulness of well @-@ trained boys . 
 In the United Kingdom , the public , through newspapers , followed Baden @-@ Powell 's struggle to hold Mafeking , and when the siege was broken , he had become a national hero . This rise to fame fuelled the sales of the small instruction book he had written in 1899 about military scouting and wilderness survival , Aids to Scouting , that owed much to what he had learned from discussions with Burnham . 
 On his return to England , Baden @-@ Powell noticed that boys showed considerable interest in Aids to Scouting , which was unexpectedly used by teachers and youth organizations as their first Scouting handbook . He was urged to rewrite this book for boys , especially during an inspection of the Boys ' Brigade , a large youth movement drilled with military precision . Baden @-@ Powell thought this would not be attractive and suggested that the Boys ' Brigade could grow much larger were Scouting to be used . He studied other schemes , parts of which he used for Scouting . 
 In July 1906 , Ernest Thompson Seton sent Baden @-@ Powell a copy of his 1902 book The <unk> Roll of the Woodcraft Indians . Seton , a British @-@ born Canadian @-@ American living in the United States , met Baden @-@ Powell in October 1906 , and they shared ideas about youth training programs . In 1907 Baden @-@ Powell wrote a draft called Boy Patrols . In the same year , to test his ideas , he gathered 21 boys of mixed social backgrounds ( from boy 's schools in the London area and a section of boys from the Poole , Parkstone , Hamworthy , Bournemouth , and Winton Boys ' Brigade units ) and held a week @-@ long camp in August on Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour , Dorset , England . His organizational method , now known as the Patrol System and a key part of Scouting training , allowed the boys to organize themselves into small groups with an elected patrol leader . 
 In the autumn of 1907 , Baden @-@ Powell went on an extensive speaking tour arranged by his publisher , Arthur Pearson , to promote his forthcoming book , Scouting for Boys . He had not simply rewritten his Aids to Scouting ; he omitted the military aspects and transferred the techniques ( mainly survival ) to non @-@ military heroes : backwoodsmen , explorers ( and later on , sailors and airmen ) . He also added innovative educational principles ( the Scout method ) by which he extended the attractive game to a personal mental education . 
 At the beginning of 1908 , Baden @-@ Powell published Scouting for Boys in six fortnightly parts , setting out activities and programmes which existing youth organisations could use . The reaction was phenomenal , and quite unexpected . In a very short time , Scout Patrols were created up and down the country , all following the principles of Baden @-@ Powell 's book . In 1909 , the first Scout Rally was held at Crystal Palace in London , to which 11 @,@ 000 Scouts came - and some girls dressed as Scouts and calling themselves " Girl Scouts " . Baden @-@ Powell retired from the Army and , in 1910 , he formed The Boy Scouts Association and , later , The Girl Guides . By the time of The Boy Scouts Association 's first census in 1910 , it had over 100 @,@ 000 Scouts . 
 Scouting for Boys was published in England later in 1908 in book form . The book is now the fourth @-@ bestselling title of all time , and was the basis for the later American version of the Boy Scout Handbook . 
 At the time , Baden @-@ Powell intended that the scheme would be used by established organizations , in particular the Boys ' Brigade , from the founder William A. Smith . However , because of the popularity of his person and the adventurous outdoor games he wrote about , boys spontaneously formed Scout patrols and flooded Baden @-@ Powell with requests for assistance . He encouraged them , and the Scouting movement developed momentum . In 1910 Baden @-@ Powell formed The Boy Scouts Association in the United Kingdom . As the movement grew , Sea Scouts , Air Scouts , and other specialized units were added to the program . 
 = = = History = = = 
 The Boy Scout Movement swiftly established itself throughout the British Empire soon after the publication of Scouting for Boys . By 1908 , Scouting was established in Gibraltar , Malta . Canada , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . In 1909 Chile was the first country outside the British dominions to have a Scouting organization recognized by Baden @-@ Powell . The first Scout rally , held in 1909 at The Crystal Palace in London , attracted 10 @,@ 000 boys and a number of girls . By 1910 , Argentina , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , India , Malaya , Mexico , the Netherlands , Norway , Russia , Sweden , and the United States had Boy Scouts . 
 The program initially focused on boys aged 11 to 18 , but as the movement grew , the need became apparent for leader training and programs for younger boys , older boys , and girls . The first Cub Scout and Rover Scout programs were in place by the late 1910s . They operated independently until they obtained official recognition from their home country 's Scouting organization . In the United States , attempts at Cub programs began as early as 1911 , but official recognition was not obtained until 1930 . 
 Girls wanted to become part of the movement almost as soon as it began . Baden @-@ Powell and his sister Agnes Baden @-@ Powell introduced the Girl Guides in 1910 , a parallel movement for girls , sometimes named Girl Scouts . Agnes Baden @-@ Powell became the first president of the Girl Guides when it was formed in 1910 , at the request of the girls who attended the Crystal Palace Rally . In 1914 , she started Rosebuds — later renamed Brownies — for younger girls . She stepped down as president of the Girl Guides in 1920 in favor of Robert 's wife Olave Baden @-@ Powell , who was named Chief Guide ( for England ) in 1918 and World Chief Guide in 1930 . At that time , girls were expected to remain separate from boys because of societal standards , though co @-@ educational youth groups did exist . By the 1990s , two thirds of the Scout organizations belonging to WOSM had become co @-@ educational . 
 Baden @-@ Powell could not single @-@ handedly advise all groups who requested his assistance . Early Scoutmaster training camps were held in London and Yorkshire in 1910 and 1911 . Baden @-@ Powell wanted the training to be as practical as possible to encourage other adults to take leadership roles , so the Wood Badge course was developed to recognize adult leadership training . The development of the training was delayed by World War I , so the first Wood Badge course was not held until 1919 . Wood Badge is used by Boy Scout associations and combined Boy Scout and Girl Guide associations in many countries . Gilwell Park near London was purchased in 1919 on behalf of The Scout Association as an adult training site and Scouting campsite . Baden @-@ Powell wrote a book , Aids to Scoutmastership , to help Scouting Leaders , and wrote other handbooks for the use of the new Scouting sections , such as Cub Scouts and Girl Guides . One of these was Rovering to Success , written for Rover Scouts in 1922 . A wide range of leader training exists in 2007 , from basic to program @-@ specific , including the Wood Badge training . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 Important elements of traditional Scouting have their origins in Baden @-@ Powell 's experiences in education and military training . He was a 50 @-@ year @-@ old retired army general when he founded Scouting , and his revolutionary ideas inspired thousands of young people , from all parts of society , to get involved in activities that most had never contemplated . Comparable organizations in the English @-@ speaking world are the Boys ' Brigade and the non @-@ militaristic Woodcraft Folk ; however , they never matched the development and growth of Scouting . 
 Aspects of Scouting practice have been criticized as too militaristic . Military @-@ style uniforms , badges of rank , flag ceremonies , and brass bands were commonly accepted in the early years because they were a part of normal society , but since then have diminished or been abandoned in both Scouting and society . 
 Local influences have also been a strong part of Scouting . By adopting and modifying local ideologies , Scouting has been able to find acceptance in a wide variety of cultures . In the United States , Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience . This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts , but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program . By contrast , British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent , because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting . Baden @-@ Powell 's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling 's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts ; for example , the name used for the Cub Scout leader , Akela ( whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos ) , is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book . 
 The name " Scouting " seems to have been inspired by the important and romantic role played by military scouts performing reconnaissance in the wars of the time . In fact , Baden @-@ Powell wrote his original military training book , Aids To Scouting , because he saw the need for the improved training of British military @-@ enlisted scouts , particularly in initiative , self @-@ reliance , and observational skills . The book 's popularity with young boys surprised him . As he adapted the book as Scouting for Boys , it seems natural that the movement adopted the names Scouting and Boy Scouts . 
 " Duty to God " is a principle of Scouting , though it is applied differently in various countries . The Boy Scouts of America ( BSA ) take a strong position , excluding atheists . The Scout Association in the United Kingdom permits variations to its Promise , in order to accommodate different religious obligations . While for example in the predominantly atheist Czech Republic the Scout oath doesn 't mention God altogether with the organization being strictly irreligious , in 2014 , United Kingdom Scouts were given the choice of being able to make a variation of the Promise that replaced " duty to God " with " uphold our Scout values " , Scouts Canada defines Duty to God broadly in terms of " adherence to spiritual principles " and leaves it to the individual member or leader whether they can follow a Scout Promise that includes Duty to God . Worldwide around one in three Scouts are Muslim .

 Scouting is taught using the Scout method , which incorporates an informal educational system that emphasizes practical activities in the outdoors . Programs exist for Scouts ranging in age from 6 to 25 ( though age limits vary slightly by country ) , and program specifics target Scouts in a manner appropriate to their age . 
 = = = Scout method = = = 
 The Scout method is the principal method by which the Scouting organizations , boy and girl , operate their units . WOSM describes Scouting as " a voluntary nonpolitical educational movement for young people open to all without distinction of origin , race or creed , in accordance with the purpose , principles and method conceived by the Founder " . It is the goal of Scouting " to contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical , intellectual , social and spiritual potentials as individuals , as responsible citizens and as members of their local , national and international communities . " 
 The principles of Scouting describe a code of behavior for all members , and characterize the movement . The Scout method is a progressive system designed to achieve these goals , comprising seven elements : law and promise , learning by doing , team system , symbolic framework , personal progression , nature , and adult support . While community service is a major element of both the WOSM and WAGGGS programs , WAGGGS includes it as an extra element of the Scout method : service in the community . 
 The Scout Law and Promise embody the joint values of the Scouting movement worldwide , and bind all Scouting associations together . The emphasis on " learning by doing " provides experiences and hands @-@ on orientation as a practical method of learning and building self @-@ confidence . Small groups build unity , camaraderie , and a close @-@ knit fraternal atmosphere . These experiences , along with an emphasis on trustworthiness and personal honor , help to develop responsibility , character , self @-@ reliance , self @-@ confidence , reliability , and readiness ; which eventually lead to collaboration and leadership . A program with a variety of progressive and attractive activities expands a Scout 's horizon and bonds the Scout even more to the group . Activities and games provide an enjoyable way to develop skills such as dexterity . In an outdoor setting , they also provide contact with the natural environment . 
 Since the birth of Scouting , Scouts worldwide have taken a Scout Promise to live up to ideals of the movement , and subscribe to the Scout Law . The form of the promise and laws have varied slightly by country and over time , but must fulfil the requirements of the WOSM to qualify a National Scout Association for membership . 
 The Scout Motto , ' Be Prepared ' , has been used in various languages by millions of Scouts since 1907 . Less well @-@ known is the Scout Slogan , ' Do a good turn daily ' . 
 = = = Activities = = = 
 Common ways to implement the Scout method include having Scouts spending time together in small groups with shared experiences , rituals , and activities , and emphasizing good citizenship and decision @-@ making by young people in an age @-@ appropriate manner . Weekly meetings often take place in local centres known as Scout dens . Cultivating a love and appreciation of the outdoors and outdoor activities is a key element . Primary activities include camping , woodcraft , aquatics , hiking , backpacking , and sports . 
 Camping is most often arranged at the unit level , such as one Scout troop , but there are periodic camps ( known in the US as " <unk> " ) and " jamborees " . Camps occur a few times a year and may involve several groups from a local area or region camping together for a weekend . The events usually have a theme , such as pioneering . World Scout <unk> are gatherings , originally for Rover Scouts , but mainly focused on Scout Leaders . Jamborees are large national or international events held every four years , during which thousands of Scouts camp together for one or two weeks . Activities at these events will include games , Scoutcraft competitions , badge , pin or patch trading , aquatics , woodcarving , archery and activities related to the theme of the event . 
 In some countries a highlight of the year for Scouts is spending at least a week in the summer engaging in an outdoor activity . This can be a camping , hiking , sailing , or other trip with the unit , or a summer camp with broader participation ( at the council , state , or provincial level ) . Scouts attending a summer camp work on merit badges , advancement , and perfecting Scoutcraft skills . Summer camps can operate specialty programs for older Scouts , such as sailing , backpacking , canoeing and whitewater , caving , and fishing . 
 At an international level Scouting perceives one of its roles as the promotion of international harmony and peace . Various initiatives are in train towards achieving this aim including the development of activities that benefit the wider community , challenge prejudice and encourage tolerance of diversity . Such programs include co @-@ operation with non @-@ Scouting organisations including various NGOs , the United Nations and religious institutions as set out in The Marrakech Charter . 
 = = = Uniforms and distinctive insignia = = = 
 Individual national or other emblems may be found at the individual country 's Scouting article . 
 The Scout uniform is a widely recognized characteristic of Scouting . In the words of Baden @-@ Powell at the 1937 World Jamboree , it " hides all differences of social standing in a country and makes for equality ; but , more important still , it covers differences of country and race and creed , and makes all feel that they are members with one another of the one great brotherhood " . The original uniform , still widely recognized , consisted of a khaki button @-@ up shirt , shorts , and a broad @-@ brimmed campaign hat . Baden @-@ Powell also wore shorts , because he believed that being dressed like a Scout helped to reduce the age @-@ imposed distance between adult and youth . Uniform shirts are now frequently blue , orange , red or green and shorts are frequently replaced by long trousers all year or only under cold weather . 
 While designed for smartness and equality , the Scout uniform is also practical . Shirts traditionally have thick seams to make them ideal for use in makeshift stretchers — Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves , a traditional but deprecated item . The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders ' Wood Badges could be used as emergency <unk> , or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry . <unk> were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need . Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary . 
 Distinctive insignia for all are Scout uniforms , recognized and worn the world over , include the Wood Badge and the World Membership Badge . Scouting has two internationally known symbols : the trefoil is used by members of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts ( WAGGGS ) and the fleur @-@ de @-@ lis by member organizations of the WOSM and most other Scouting organizations . 
 The swastika was used as an early symbol by the Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom and others . Its earliest use in Scouting was on the Thanks Badge introduced in 1911 . Lord Baden @-@ Powell 's 1922 design for the Medal of Merit added a swastika to the Scout Arrowhead to symbolize good luck for the recipient . In 1934 , Scouters requested a change to the design because of the connection of the swastika with its more recent use by the German National Socialist Workers ( Nazi ) Party . A new Medal of Merit was issued by the Boy Scouts Association in 1935 . 
 = = Age groups and sections = = 
 Scouting and Guiding movements are generally divided into sections by age or school grade , allowing activities to be tailored to the maturity of the group 's members . These age divisions have varied over time as they adapt to the local culture and environment . 
 Scouting was originally developed for adolescents — youths between the ages of 11 and 17 . In most member organizations , this age group composes the Scout or Guide section . Programs were developed to meet the needs of young children ( generally ages 6 to 10 ) and young adults ( originally 18 and older , and later up to 25 ) . Scouts and Guides were later split into " junior " and " senior " sections in many member organizations , and some organizations dropped the young adults ' section . The exact age ranges for programs vary by country and association . 
 The national programs for younger children include Tiger Cubs , Cub Scouts , Brownies , Daisies , Rainbow Guides , Beaver Scouts , Joey Scouts , <unk> , and <unk> . Programs for post @-@ adolescents and young adults include the Senior Section , Rover Scouts , Senior Scouts , Venture Scouts , Explorer Scouts , and the Scout Network . Many organizations also have a program for members with special needs . This is usually known as Extension Scouting , but sometimes has other names , such as <unk> . The Scout Method has been adapted to specific programs such as Air Scouts , Sea Scouts , Rider Guides and <unk> . 
 In many countries , Scouting is organized into neighborhood Scout Groups , or Districts , which contain one or more sections . Under the umbrella of the Scout Group , sections are divided according to age , each having their own terminology and leadership structure . 
 = = Adults and leadership = = 
 Adults interested in Scouting or Guiding , including former Scouts and Guides , often join organizations such as the International Scout and Guide Fellowship . In the United States and the Philippines , university students might join the co @-@ ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega . In the United Kingdom , university students might join the Student Scout and Guide Organisation , and after graduation , the Scout and Guide Graduate Association . 
 Scout units are usually operated by adult volunteers , such as parents and carers , former Scouts , students , and community leaders , including teachers and religious leaders . Scout Leadership positions are often divided into ' uniform ' and ' lay ' positions . Uniformed leaders have received formal training , such as the Wood Badge , and have received a warrant for a rank within the organization . Lay members commonly hold part @-@ time roles such as meeting helpers , committee members and advisors , though there are a small number of full @-@ time lay professionals . 
 A unit has uniformed positions — such as the Scoutmaster and assistants — whose titles vary among countries . In some countries , units are supported by lay members , who range from acting as meeting helpers to being members of the unit 's committee . In some Scout associations , the committee members may also wear uniforms and be registered Scout leaders . 
 Above the unit are further uniformed positions , called Commissioners , at levels such as district , county , council or province , depending on the structure of the national organization . Commissioners work with lay teams and professionals . Training teams and related functions are often formed at these levels . In the UK and in other countries , the national Scout organization appoints the Chief Scout , the most senior uniformed member . 
 = = Around the world = = 
 Following its foundation in the United Kingdom , Scouting spread around the globe . The first association outside the British Empire was founded in Chile in May 21 , 1909 after a visit to Baden Powell . In most countries of the world , there is now at least one Scouting ( or Guiding ) organization . Each is independent , but international cooperation continues to be seen as part of the Scout Movement . In 1922 the WOSM started as the governing body on policy for the national Scouting organizations ( then male only ) . In addition to being the governing policy body , it organizes the World Scout Jamboree every four years . 
 In 1928 the WAGGGS started as the equivalent to WOSM for the then female @-@ only national Scouting / Guiding organizations . It is also responsible for its four international centres : Our Cabaña in Mexico , Our Chalet in Switzerland , Pax Lodge in the United Kingdom , and Sangam in India . 
 Today at the international level , the two largest umbrella organizations are : 
 World Organization of the Scout Movement ( WOSM ) , for boys @-@ only and co @-@ educational organizations . 
 World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts ( WAGGGS ) , primarily for girls @-@ only organizations but also accepting co @-@ educational organizations . 
 = = = Co @-@ educational = = = 
 There have been different approaches to co @-@ educational Scouting . Countries such as the United States have maintained separate Scouting organizations for boys and girls . In other countries , especially within Europe , Scouting and Guiding have merged , and there is a single organization for boys and girls , which is a member of both the WOSM and the WAGGGS . In others , such as Australia and the United Kingdom , the national Scout association has opted to admit both boys and girls , but is only a member of the WOSM , while the national Guide association has remained as a separate movement and member of the WAGGGS . In some countries like Greece , Slovenia and Spain there are separate associations of Scouts ( members of WOSM ) and guides ( members of WAGGGS ) , both admitting boys and girls . 
 The Scout Association in the United Kingdom has been co @-@ educational at all levels since 1991 , and this was optional for groups until the year 2000 when new sections were been required to accept girls . The Scout Association transitioned all Scout groups and sections across the UK to become co @-@ educational by January 2007 , the year of Scouting 's centenary . The traditional Baden @-@ Powell Scouts ' Association has been co @-@ educational since its formation in 1970 . 
 In the United States , the Cub Scout and Boy Scout programs of the BSA are for boys only ; however , for youths age 14 and older , Venturing is co @-@ educational . The Girl Scouts of the USA ( <unk> ) is an independent organization for girls and young women only . Adult leadership positions in the BSA and <unk> are open to both men and women . 
 In 2006 , of the 155 WOSM member National Scout Organizations ( representing 155 countries ) , 122 belonged only to WOSM , and 34 belonged to both WOSM and WAGGGS . Of the 122 which belonged only to WOSM , 95 were open to boys and girls in some or all program sections , and 20 were only for boys . All 34 that belonged to both WOSM and WAGGGS were open to boys and girls . 
 WAGGGS had 144 Member Organizations in 2007 and 110 of them belonged only to WAGGGS . Of these 110 , 17 were coeducational and 93 admitted only girls .

 As of 2010 , there are over 32 million registered Scouts and as of 2006 10 million registered Guides around the world , from 216 countries and territories .

 Fifteen years passed between the first publication of Scouting for Boys and the creation of the current largest supranational Scout organization , WOSM , and millions of copies had been sold in dozens of languages . By that point , Scouting was the purview of the world 's youth , and several Scout associations had already formed in many countries . 
 Alternative groups have formed since the original formation of the Scouting " Boy Patrols " . They can be a result of groups or individuals who maintain that the WOSM and WAGGGS are currently more political and less youth @-@ based than envisioned by Lord Baden @-@ Powell . They believe that Scouting in general has moved away from its original intent because of political machinations that happen to longstanding organizations , and want to return to the earliest , simplest methods . Others do not want to follow all the original ideals of Scouting but still desire to participate in Scout @-@ like activities . 
 In 2008 , there were at least 539 independent Scouting organizations around the world , 367 of them were a member of either WAGGGS or WOSM . About half of the remaining 172 Scouting organizations are only local or national oriented . About 90 national or regional Scouting associations have created their own international Scouting organizations . Those are served by five international Scouting organizations : 
 Order of World Scouts – the first international Scouting organisation , founded in 1911 . 
 Union Internationale des Guides et Scouts d 'Europe , an independent faith @-@ based Scouting organization founded in 1956 . 
 Confédération Européenne de <unk> , established in 1978 . 
 World Federation of Independent Scouts , formed in Laubach , Germany , in 1996 . 
 World Organization of Independent Scouts , mostly South @-@ American , founded in 2010 . 
 Some Scout @-@ like organizations are also served by international organizations for example :

 After the inception of Scouting in the early 1900s , some nations ' programs have taken part in social movements such as the nationalist resistance movements in India . Although Scouting was introduced to Africa by British officials as a way to strengthen their rule , the values they based Scouting on helped to challenge the legitimacy of British imperialism . Likewise , African Scouts used the Scout Law 's principle that a Scout is a brother to all other Scouts to collectively claim full imperial citizenship .

 More recently , the Boy Scouts of America was the focus of criticism in the United States for not allowing the open participation of homosexuals until removing the prohibition in 2013 . 
 In the United Kingdom , The Scout Association had been criticised for its insistence on the use of a religious promise , leading to the introduction of an alternative in January 2014 for those not wanting to mention a god in their promise . This change making the organisation entirely non @-@ discriminatory on the grounds of race , gender , sexuality , and religion ( or lack thereof ) . 
 Authoritarian communist regimes like the Soviet Union in 1920 and fascist regimes like Nazi Germany in 1934 often either absorbed the Scout movement into government @-@ controlled organizations , or banned Scouting entirely . 
 = = In film and the arts = = 
 Scouting has been a facet of culture during most of the 20th century in many countries ; numerous films and artwork focus on the subject . Movie critic Roger Ebert mentioned the scene in which the young Boy Scout , Indiana Jones , discovers the Cross of Coronado in the movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , as " when he discovers his life mission . " 
 The works of painters Ernest Stafford Carlos , Norman Rockwell , Pierre Joubert and Joseph <unk> and the 1966 film Follow Me , Boys ! are prime examples of this ethos . Scouting is often dealt with in a humorous manner , as in the 1989 film Troop Beverly Hills , the 2005 film Down and Derby , and the film Scout Camp . In 1980 , Scottish singer and songwriter Gerry Rafferty recorded I was a Boy Scout as part of his Snakes and Ladders album .

 The game is a side @-@ scrolling shoot ' em up and revolves around the protagonist , Lieutenant Dale Hawkins , recovering caches of hidden Stinger missiles from Arab terrorists in Oman . The game features a total of five levels with varying locations and begins with allocating five lives to the player . The main objective of the game is to locate and place time bombs on boxes containing Stinger missiles , in which the player is required to escape before the time runs out . The enemies featured in the game are Arab terrorists ; the player must neutralise them by shooting them with their selected weapon , which is a handgun by default . Other weapons available in the game include machine guns , rocket launchers , and a flamethrower , which are only accessible through finding hidden crates . 
 The second level of the game is in Beirut , and focuses on the player , along with a group of Navy Seals , rescuing hostages in a 3D presentation of the city . If the player is successful in rescuing the hostages and recovering all missiles , the remaining forces will rendezvous at a submarine . During the game , the player @-@ character may grapple onto ledges , climb ladders , crawl , and jump in any direction . The player can also push large crates in order to reach higher platforms . Combat is focused on shooting an enemy with a weapon on sight , however the player can crawl at any time in order to avoid the oncoming bullets of an enemy . The player is also able to neutralise enemies by dropping down onto them whilst dangling from a higher platform . In every level , the game sets a time limit when a bomb is placed on one of the crates containing Stinger missiles .

 = Ernst Lindemann = 
 Otto Ernst Lindemann ( 28 March 1894 – 27 May 1941 ) was a German Kapitän zur See ( naval captain ) . He was the only commander of the battleship Bismarck during its eight months of service in World War II . 
 Lindemann joined the German Imperial Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) in 1913 , and after his basic military training , served on a number of warships during World War I as a wireless telegraphy officer . On board SMS Bayern , he participated in Operation Albion in 1917 . After World War I , he served in various staff and naval gunnery training positions . One year after the outbreak of World War II , he was appointed commander of the battleship Bismarck , at the time the largest warship in commission anywhere in the world and the pride of the Kriegsmarine ( Nazi Germany 's navy ) . 
 In May 1941 , Lindemann commanded Bismarck during Operation Rheinübung . Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen formed a task force under the command of Admiral Günther Lütjens on board Bismarck . Orders were to break out of their base in German occupied Poland and attack British merchant shipping lanes in the Atlantic Ocean . The task force 's first major engagement was the Battle of the Denmark Strait which resulted in the sinking of HMS Hood . Less than a week later , on 27 May , Lindemann and most of his crew lost their lives during Bismarck 's last battle . 
 He was posthumously awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) , an honour that recognised extreme bravery on the battlefield or outstanding military leadership . The medal was presented to his widow , Hildegard , on 6 January 1942 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Otto Ernst Lindemann was born on 28 March 1894 in Altenkirchen in the Westerwald , Rhine Province . He was the first of three children of Dr. <unk> . Georg Heinrich Ernst Lindemann and Maria Lindemann , née Lieber . Known as Ernst , Georg Lindemann was a probationary judge ( <unk> ) and later president of the Prussian Central Land Credit Company , a Prussian credit bank . 
 Otto Ernst Lindemann was baptised into the Protestant Church on 26 April 1894 . The family moved to the Charlottenburg quarter of Berlin , where they lived at 6 Carmer Street , in 1895 . His younger brother — Kurt — was born in 1896 , followed by a second brother , Hans @-@ Wolfgang , in 1900 . The family relocated again in 1903 , this time to their own house in the Dahlem quarter of Berlin , near the Grunewald forest . 
 In 1910 , when Lindemann was 16 , his uncle Kapitän zur See Friedrich <unk> was in command of the light cruiser SMS Mainz ( October 1909 – January 1910 ) of the Imperial Navy , at that time holding the rank of Fregattenkapitän ( commander ) . At a family reunion in Hamelin , Lindemann talked with his uncle and heard of his seafaring adventures in the Far East . These conversations gave Lindemann the idea of a naval career . 
 Lindemann graduated from the Bismarck @-@ Gymnasium ( secondary school ) in Berlin @-@ Wilmersdorf with his Abitur ( diploma ) late in 1912 with an average @-@ to @-@ good overall rating . For the next six months , he attended the Royal Polytechnic Institution in Richmond , London .

 Ernst Lindemann met Charlotte Weil ( née Fritsche ; 1899 – 1979 ) , a Berlin singer , in the spring of 1920 . The couple married on 1 February 1921 , and they had a daughter , Helga Maria , born on 26 February 1924 . Lindemann 's job as a naval officer demanded that he be away from his family for long periods of time . This proved to be too demanding on the marriage , and they were divorced in 1932 . Lindemann was engaged again on 20 July 1933 to his youngest brother 's sister @-@ in @-@ law , Hildegard Burchard . Hildegard was 14 years younger than Lindemann . They married on 27 October 1934 in the St. <unk> Church in Berlin – Dahlem . The ceremony was performed by Martin Niemöller , a founder of the Confessing Church , later imprisoned as an anti @-@ Nazi . They had a daughter , Heidi Maria , born on 6 July 1939 .

 On 26 March 1913 , Lindemann traveled with his parents to Flensburg for his medical examination at the Naval Academy at Mürwik . The strong financial background of his parents made him a suitable applicant for the Imperial Navy , as the costs associated with a naval education in 1909 were 800 – 1 @,@ 000 Marks per year for eight years . By comparison , a metal worker earned 1 @,@ 366 Marks annually and a teacher 3 @,@ 294 Marks . Only 5 percent of the German population at the time earned more than 3 @,@ 000 Marks annually . However , the doctor certified him as fit only for limited duties ( <unk> <unk> ) , as pneumonia in childhood had left him unfit for service in U @-@ boats . After a second examination , he was accepted on probation , and Lindemann became one of the 290 young men of " Crew 1913 " ( the incoming class of 1913 ) . He was officially enlisted in the Imperial Navy as a Seekadett ( midshipman ) on 1 April 1913 . 
 In early May 1913 , the cadets of Crew 1913 were sent to the training ships SMS Hansa , SMS Hertha , SMS Victoria Louise and SMS Vineta . Lindemann was assigned to Hertha with 71 of his comrades . At that time , Hertha was under the command of Captain Heinrich Rohardt , a friend of his uncle Friedrich . Arriving on board on 9 May , they were divided into watches consisting of roughly 18 men each . Hertha left Mürwik and stayed in Kiel until the end of the month . On 29 May 1913 , Hertha headed for Swinemünde , where she stayed until 15 June . The next stop , via Sassnitz and Visby , was Stockholm , Sweden , arriving on 24 June . The ship remained in Stockholm until 1 July , before leaving for Bergen in Norway . After a few days , the voyage continued to the <unk> Fjord . Here , Lindemann met his commander @-@ in @-@ chief — Kaiser Wilhelm II — for the first time . Hertha then returned to Germany , arriving in Wilhelmshaven on 8 August 1913 . 
 One week later , Hertha began a seven @-@ month training cruise ( 15 August 1913 – 12 March 1914 ) . The voyage took Lindemann to Dartmouth in England , <unk> de <unk> in Spain , Faial Island in the Azores and as far as Halifax in Nova Scotia . The return trip then went via Vera Cruz in Mexico , Havana in Cuba , Port @-@ au @-@ Prince in Haiti , Kingston in Jamaica , Port of Spain in Trinidad and then to the Canary Islands , Madeira , and the Spanish mainland , arriving back in Germany in the middle of March 1914 , first in Brunsbüttel and two days later in Kiel . Lindemann was promoted to Fähnrich zur See ( Ensign ) on 3 April 1914 . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 With the German declaration of war in August 1914 , all further training at the naval academy was terminated and the normal compulsory officer examination was skipped . The entire Crew 1913 was assigned to various units in the Imperial Navy . Lindemann was assigned to SMS Lothringen , a battleship which belonged to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet under the command of Vizeadmiral ( vice admiral ) Reinhard Scheer , taking on the position of 3rd wireless telegraphy officer . Lothringen was mostly tasked with patrolling the North Sea , sailing back and forth between Altenbruch ( now part of Cuxhaven ) and Brunsbüttel without engaging in combat . Lindemann left Lothringen on 1 June 1915 to attend the wireless telegraphy school at Mürwik . He successfully completed the course and returned from it in July 1915 . He then took over the position of 2nd wireless telegraphy officer and was promoted to Leutnant zur See ( Second Lieutenant ) on 18 September 1915 . 
 On 19 March 1916 , Lindemann was transferred to the newly commissioned battleship SMS Bayern ( under the command of Captain Max Hahn ) , with the same rank of 2nd wireless telegraphy officer . Bayern , with her eight 38 cm ( 15 in ) guns , was the most powerful ship of the fleet . Her crew had been largely assigned from Lothringen , which continued to serve as a training ship . Aboard Bayern , now under the command of Captain Rohardt , Lindemann participated in Operation Albion in September – October 1917 . Operation Albion 's objective was the invasion and occupation of the Estonian islands of Saaremaa ( Ösel ) , Hiiumaa ( Dagö ) and Muhu ( Moon ) , then part of the Russian Republic . At 05 : 07 on 12 October 1917 , Bayern struck a mine while moving into her bombardment position to secure the landing beaches at Pamerort . Seven sailors were killed . Despite mine damage , Bayern engaged the coast defense battery at Cape Toffri on the southern tip of Hiiumaa . Bayern was released from her duties at 14 : 00 that day . Preliminary repairs were made on 13 October in Tagga Bay before she returned to Kiel on 1 November 1917 . 
 After the armistice in 1918 , Bayern — together with the majority of the German High Seas Fleet — was interned at Scapa Flow , the home of the British Grand Fleet . Bayern arrived there on 23 November 1918 with a skeleton crew of only 175 men , including Lindemann , who was then ordered to return to Germany , arriving in Kiel on 12 January . On 21 June 1919 , Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the interned fleet to be scuttled , and Bayern sank at 14 : 30 .

 When Ernst Lindemann returned to Germany , it was uncertain whether he could remain on active military service . As a result of the Treaty of Versailles which was signed on 28 June 1919 , the former Imperial German Navy was downsized to 15 @,@ 000 men , including 1 @,@ 500 officers , while being renamed the Reichsmarine in the era of the Weimar Republic . As Lindemann had finished fifth in the Class of 1913 , he stood a good chance of being retained . He served temporarily in the Dahlem Protection Company a part of the Protection Regiment of Greater Berlin ( June – July 1919 ) , before he became adjutant to the newly created chief of the Naval Command Department ( 1 August 1919 – 30 September 1922 ) , at the time under the command of William Michaelis . The Naval Command Department was directly subordinated to the Admiralty Staff . At the same time , he held the position of adjutant in the Fleet Department . During this assignment Lindemann was promoted to Oberleutnant zur See ( Sub @-@ Lieutenant ) on 7 January 1920 . 
 Lindemann 's next assignment ( 1 October 1922 – 30 September 1924 ) was aboard the battleship Hannover , where he served as a watch and division officer . During this assignment , he attended an officers ' course at the ships ' gunnery school in Kiel between 5 February and 3 May 1924 . From here , Lindemann took command of the 1st Artillery Company of the 3rd Coastal Defense Department in Friedrichsort in Kiel from 1 October 1924 – 26 September 1926 . His commanding officer was Korvettenkapitän ( Lieutenant Commander ) Otto Schultze , a former World War I U @-@ boat commander and later Generaladmiral ( general admiral ) of the Kriegsmarine . In this position , Lindemann was promoted to Kapitänleutnant ( captain lieutenant ) on 1 January 1925 . 
 His next assignment ( 27 September 1926 – 6 September 1929 ) placed him on the Admiral 's staff at the Baltic Naval Station , first as a staff officer and then as assistant to the chief of the station , which at the time was under the command of Vice Admiral Erich Raeder . From here , he was transferred to the Elsass serving as the second gunnery officer and <unk> ( officer in charge of cadets ) , responsible for the on @-@ board training of the officer cadets , from 7 September 1929 – 25 February 1930 . Holding the same rank and position , Lindemann then transferred to the Schleswig @-@ Holstein .

 On 30 January 1933 , the Nazi Party , under the leadership of Adolf Hitler , came to power in Germany , ushering in a period of naval rearmament . In 1935 , the Reichsmarine was renamed the Kriegsmarine . Between 22 September 1931 and 22 September 1934 , Lindemann was a senior lecturer at the Naval Gunnery School in Kiel . He was then posted to the Hessen under the command of Captain Hermann Boehm and served as first gunnery officer from 23 September 1933 to 8 April 1934 . Ernst Lindemann was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on 1 April 1932 . On 9 April 1934 , he was ordered to the Wilhelmshaven Shipyard ( 9 April – 11 November 1934 ) for training in ship construction and familiarisation with the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer , under the command of Captain Wilhelm Marschall . 
 On Admiral Scheer , he again served as first gunnery officer , and in this position he participated in the Spanish Civil War ( 24 July – 30 August 1936 ) . Admiral Scheer had to make ready for the mission on short notice ; the order came from Admiral Rolf <unk> on 23 July 1936 at 13 : 45 . The normal 48 hours required to prepare the ship was reduced to 12 hours , demanding a lot of the crew and especially Lindemann . As the first gunnery officer , Lindemann was responsible for handling and storing all munitions . Admiral Scheer and the cruiser Deutschland left Germany on 24 July at 8 : 00 . Lindemann 's main responsibilities included commanding the German landing parties and acting as diplomatic aid and interpreter for Captain Marschall . These landing parties consisted of up to 350 men , which included 11 officers , 15 non @-@ commissioned officers and 266 sailors , or roughly one @-@ third of the crew . On the return voyage to Germany , Admiral Scheer stopped at Gibraltar on the morning of 25 August 1936 . Marschall , Lindemann and other officers met with the British Governor and Rear Admiral James Somerville . After Lindemann returned to Germany , he was promoted to commander on 1 October 1936 . 
 Between 1936 and 1938 , he was an adviser and later head of the ship construction department at the Naval High Command , and at the same time a consultant to and later chief of the Naval Training Department . On 1 April 1938 , he was promoted to the rank of Kapitän zur See ( captain at sea ) . On 30 September 1939 , one month after the outbreak of World War II , Lindemann succeeded Captain Heinrich <unk> as commander of the Naval Gunnery School in Wik in Kiel , after <unk> took command of the heavy cruiser Blücher . Under his command were three training departments , the gunnery training ship Bremse and Hektor , numerous gunnery training boats , gun carriers , auxiliary vessels , and occasionally Hitler 's state yacht , the aviso Grille . 
 = = = Commander of the battleship Bismarck = = = 
 Ernst Lindemann was frustrated by the fact that — as commander of the Naval Gunnery School — he would never come into direct contact with the enemy . When he received the news that he had been selected to be the first commander of the battleship Bismarck , he was honoured by the trust that had been bestowed on him but doubted that he would be able to get Bismarck ready for action before the war was over . His doubts suggest that he was confident the war would end in a favourable outcome for Germany by mid @-@ 1940 . Prior to commanding Bismarck , Lindemann had never held any shipboard command , a situation rare if not unique in the Kriegsmarine . Nevertheless , Lindemann had served exclusively on ships with a gun calibre of at least 28 cm ( 11 in ) , and he was Germany 's leading gunnery expert . In 1940 , he ranked second out of Crew 1913 and was considered an outstanding leader . 
 Lindemann arrived at the Blohm & Voss shipbuilding works in Hamburg at the beginning of August 1940 . Bismarck 's keel had been laid on 1 July 1936 and she was launched on 14 February 1939 . <unk> Freiherr von Müllenheim @-@ Rechberg joined Bismarck as fourth gunnery officer in June 1940 , and he would become the highest @-@ ranking officer to survive Bismarck 's last battle on 27 May 1941 . Much of what is currently known about Bismarck 's final days is attributed to his account as a witness . Lindemann made Von Müllenheim @-@ Rechberg his personnel adjutant and instructed him to refer to the ship as " he " rather than " she " ; Lindemann considered the ship too powerful to be referred to as a female . He commissioned the battleship on 24 August 1940 . He showed a great deal of attachment to the ship and was respected by his crew . 
 Bismarck left the Kiel Fjord on the morning of 28 September 1940 heading east . After an uneventful voyage through rough seas , Bismarck reached Gotenhafen ( now Gdynia ) the next day . Here Bismarck conducted a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig ( now Gdańsk Bay ) . By 30 November 1940 , Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew , which they passed easily . During high speed trials , Bismarck reached a top speed of 30 @.@ 8 kn ( 57 @.@ 0 km / h ; 35 @.@ 4 mph ) , exceeding the design speed . However , one weakness quickly became apparent : without using the rudders but only the screws , Bismarck was almost impossible to steer . 
 In November 1940 , Von Müllenheim @-@ Rechberg was sent to the Naval Gunnery School at Wik to complete his heavy gun training courses , which ended his position as Lindemann 's personal adjutant . Lindemann 's new adjutant was the signals officer Second Lieutenant Wolfgang Reiner . Bismarck 's heavy guns were first test @-@ fired in the second half of November , and Bismarck was shown to be a very stable gun platform . After the 1940 Christmas celebration on board , Lindemann and the majority of the officers , non @-@ commissioned officers and sailors went on home leave . First gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider relieved Lindemann as Bismarck 's commander during his absence . Lindemann spent his leave with his wife and daughter and returned on 1 January 1941 . 
 On 28 April 1941 , the ship and crew were ready , and stores were on board for a three @-@ month mission . Lindemann notified Naval High Command ( Oberkommando der Marine ) , Naval Groups North and West ( <unk> Nord und West ) and Fleet Command that Bismarck was ready for action . The Chief of Fleet — Admiral Günther Lütjens — and his fleet staff held drills for the first time on board Bismarck on 13 May , testing the communication chain between Fleet Command and Bismarck 's officers . 
 Adolf Hitler — accompanied by Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel , his former naval adjutant Commander Karl @-@ <unk> von Puttkamer , and his Luftwaffe adjutant Oberst Nicolaus von Below , among others — visited Bismarck on 5 May 1941 . Missing was Grand Admiral Erich Raeder . Hitler was taken on a tour of the ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations . Hitler and Lütjens also met in private and discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic . After this meeting , Hitler and the officers of Bismarck had lunch in the officers ' mess , where Hitler spoke about America 's unwillingness to enter the war . Lindemann openly disagreed with Hitler , expressing his opinion that the possibility of the United States entering the war could not be ruled out . 
 = = = Operation Rheinübung = = = 
 The goal of Operation Rheinübung ( Rhine Exercise ) was for Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen — under the command of Lindemann 's Crew 1913 classmate Captain Helmuth Brinkmann — to break into the Atlantic and attack Allied shipping . Grand Admiral Raeder 's orders to the task force commander — Admiral Günther Lütjens — were that " the objective of the Bismarck is not to defeat enemies of equal strength , but to tie them down in a delaying action , while preserving combat capacity as much as possible , so as to allow Prinz Eugen to get at the merchant ships in the convoy " and " The primary target in this operation is the enemy 's merchant shipping ; enemy warships will be engaged only when that objective makes it necessary and it can be done without excessive risk . " 
 At 02 : 00 on 19 May 1941 , Bismarck and Prinz Eugen left Gotenhafen and proceeded through the Baltic Sea and out toward the Atlantic . Unknown to Lütjens , the British had intercepted enough signals to infer that a German naval operation might occur in the area . The German task force was first encountered by the Swedish seaplane @-@ cruiser Gotland on 20 May heading north @-@ west past Gothenburg . The British Admiralty was informed through a Norwegian officer in Stockholm who had learned of the sighting from a Swedish military intelligence source . Alerted by this report , British Admiralty requested air reconnaissance of the Norwegian coast . A Spitfire reconnaissance aircraft found and photographed the German task force in the Grimstad fjord ( 60 ° 19 @.@ 49 ′ N 5 ° 14 @.@ 48 ′ E ) , near Bergen , at 13 : 15 on 21 May . On the evening of 23 May at 19 : 22 , the German force was detected by the heavy cruisers HMS Suffolk and Norfolk that had been patrolling the Denmark Strait in the expectation of a German breakout . The alarm was sounded and Lindemann announced at 20 : 30 over the intercom : " Feind in <unk> an <unk> , Schiff nimmt <unk> auf " . ( Enemy sighted to port . Engage ! ) Bismarck fired five salvos without scoring a direct hit . The heavily outgunned British cruisers retired to a safe distance and shadowed the enemy until their own heavy units could draw closer . However , Bismarck 's forward radar had failed as a result of vibration from the heavy guns firing during this skirmish , and Lütjens was obliged to order Prinz Eugen to move ahead of Bismarck in order to provide the squadron with forward radar coverage . 
 At the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 24 May 1941 , HMS Hood was sunk , probably by Bismarck . The hydrophones on Prinz Eugen detected a foreign ship to port at 05 : 00 . The Germans sighted the smokestacks of two ships at 05 : 45 , which the first gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider initially reported as two heavy cruisers . The first British salvo revealed them to be battleships , but not until the British task force turned to port was their precise identity revealed . The British ships started firing at the German task force at 05 : 53 . Vice @-@ Admiral Lancelot Holland planned on targeting Bismarck first , but due to the reversed German battle order , HMS Prince of Wales and Hood opened fire on the Prinz Eugen instead . The commander of the Prince of Wales — Captain John Leach — detected this error and ordered his guns swung around to fire on Bismarck . The German task force was still waiting for the order to commence firing , which Admiral Lütjens did not give immediately . Two minutes later , after multiple inquiries by Schneider , " Frage <unk> " ? ( Permission to open fire ? ) , an impatient Lindemann responded : " Ich <unk> mir doch nicht mein Schiff unter dem <unk> <unk> . <unk> ! " ( I 'm not letting my ship get shot out from under my arse . Open fire ! ) At 06 : 01 , the fifth salvo by Bismarck , fired at a range of about 180 <unk> ( 18 @,@ 000 m ; 20 @,@ 000 yd ) , was seen to hit Hood abreast her mainmast . It is likely that one 38 cm ( 15 in ) shell struck somewhere between Hood 's mainmast and ' X ' turret aft of the mast . A huge jet of flame burst out from Hood from the vicinity of the mainmast . This was followed by a devastating magazine explosion that destroyed the aft part of the ship . This explosion broke the back of Hood , and she sank in only three minutes , her nearly vertical bow last to descend into the water . 
 Following the explosion , Prince of Wales was targeted by both German ships and disengaged from combat after seven direct hits , four by Bismarck and three by Prinz Eugen , at about 06 : 09 . During this brief engagement , Prince of Wales had also hit Bismarck three times , first striking the commander 's boat and putting the seaplane catapult amidships out of action . The second shell passed right through the bow from one side to the other . The third struck the hull underwater and burst inside the ship , flooding a generator room and damaging the bulkhead of an adjoining boiler room , partially flooding it . The damage caused to Bismarck by these two shots allowed 2 @,@ 000 t ( 2 @,@ 200 short tons ) of water into the ship . 
 Lindemann and Lütjens at this point differed on how best to continue the mission . Lindemann , as commander of a battleship , was guided by the tactical situation , and wanted to hunt down the damaged Prince of Wales . ( The Germans did not at that time know the ship to be Prince of Wales , but knew that it was a King George V @-@ class battleship . ) Lütjens , apparently mindful of the fleet order to avoid unnecessary contact with similar enemy units , rejected this without discussion . Lindemann and Lütjens also differed on where to take the ship for repairs ; Lindemann advocated retracing their route through the Denmark Strait and returning to Bergen , Norway . Lütjens overruled him and ordered a course set for Saint @-@ Nazaire , France . In the afternoon , Admiral Lütjens ordered Prinz Eugen to break away from Bismarck and operate independently against the enemy 's merchant shipping . Prinz Eugen and Bismarck separated at 18 : 14 that evening . Prinz Eugen arrived safely at Brest , France on 1 June 1941 . No direct witnesses to this difference of opinion survived the sinking , but <unk> ( Leading Seaman ) Heinz Staat , the helmsman on the bridge , remembered a telephone call between the First Watch Officer , Commander Hans Oels , and a fleet staff officer which suggested that Lindemann had been trying to persuade Lütjens to pursue the enemy . A messenger returning to his comrades below spoke of " <unk> Luft " ( " thick air " or a " bad atmosphere " ) on the bridge . 
 Bismarck was sunk less than a week later , after a concentrated effort by Britain 's Royal Navy . At 23 : 30 ( local time 19 : 30 ) on 24 May an attack was made by a small group of nine Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers of 825 Naval Air Squadron under the command of Eugene Esmonde from the aircraft carrier HMS Victorious . One hit was scored , which killed <unk> Kurt Kirchberg , but caused only superficial damage to the Bismarck 's armoured belt . In mid @-@ morning at 10 : 30 on 26 May , a RAF Coastal Command Catalina reconnaissance aircraft from 209 Squadron RAF spotted Bismarck roughly 700 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 300 km ; 810 mi ) west of Saint @-@ Nazaire . The British battle group Force H , under the command of Admiral James Somerville , whose main units were the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal , the First World War era battlecruiser HMS Renown and the cruiser HMS Sheffield , was ordered to stop Bismarck . At 19 : 15 that evening , 15 Swordfish from Ark Royal launched an attack . The air raid alarm was sounded on Bismarck at 20 : 30 . Roughly 15 minutes into the attack Bismarck was possibly hit by one torpedo , and at around 21 : 00 another single torpedo jammed Bismarck 's rudder 12 ° to port . Damage @-@ control parties laboured to regain steering control and uncoupled and centred the starboard rudder , but failed to free the port rudder . With asymmetric power applied , speed reduced to 8 kn ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) , Bismarck was on a converging course with the Royal Navy units on the chase . The alarm sounded again at 23 : 00 when destroyers of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla under the command of Captain Philip Vian attacked Bismarck . Throughout the night Bismarck was targeted by incessant torpedo attacks by HMS Cossack , Sikh , Maori , Zulu , and ORP Piorun , denying Lindemann and the crew much @-@ needed rest . 
 Bismarck 's alarm sounded for the last time at 08 : 00 on the morning of 27 May 1941 . Norfolk sighted the Bismarck at 08 : 15 , and the battleship HMS Rodney opened fire on Bismarck at 08 : 48 . Bismarck returned fire at 08 : 49 . Further involved in the final battle were the battleship HMS King George V and the cruisers Norfolk and HMS Dorsetshire . Torpedo bombers did not participate in the final battle . Bismarck 's forward command position was hit at 08 : 53 , and both forward gun turrets were put out of action at 09 : 02 , killing Adalbert Schneider in the main gun director . The after command position was destroyed at 09 : 18 and turret Dora was disabled at 09 : 24 . Bismarck received further heavy hits at 09 : 40 , resulting in a fire amidships , and turret Caesar went out of action after a hit at 09 : 50 . All weapons fell silent at 10 : 00 . Short of fuel , Rodney and King George V had to disengage prior to Bismarck 's sinking . The Germans were preparing to scuttle Bismarck when three torpedoes fired by Dorsetshire hit the ship 's side armour . Bismarck sank at 10 : 36 at position 48 ° 10 ′ N 16 ° 12 ′ W , roughly 300 nmi ( 560 km ; 350 mi ) west of <unk> ( Ushant ) . The cruiser Dorsetshire saved 85 men , and the British destroyer Maori saved 25 . A further five sailors were saved by German submarine U @-@ 74 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Eitel @-@ Friedrich Kentrat and the weather observation ship <unk> . The Befehlshaber der U @-@ Boote ( U @-@ boats Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief ) Karl Dönitz had ordered U @-@ 556 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Herbert <unk> to pick up Bismarck 's war diary . Out of torpedoes and low on fuel , <unk> requested that the order be transferred to U @-@ 74 . U @-@ 74 failed to reach Bismarck on time and the war diary was never retrieved .

 <unk> von Müllenheim @-@ Rechberg saw Lindemann for the last time at around 08 : 00 on the command bridge just prior to the final battle . Von Müllenheim @-@ Rechberg described the normally intelligent , humorous and optimistic Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn . Von Müllenheim @-@ Rechberg tried to talk to him and was ignored , and later wondered whether this was due to combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down . 
 Lindemann 's body was never recovered , and it is thought that he , Lütjens and other officers probably died when shells from the British warships hit Bismarck 's bridge at 09 : 02 . When Robert Ballard , the oceanographer responsible for finding RMS Titanic discovered the wreck of the Bismarck in 1989 , he found that most of the forward superstructure had been blasted away by shellfire and there were more than 50 shell holes around the area of the conning tower . This may support the theory . 
 Alternatively , Lindemann may have left his combat position when the ship 's controls were rendered inoperable , and prior to the lethal hit on the command position , in order to give the command to abandon the ship . The surviving <unk> Paul Hillen — who had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle , stated that he had seen a group of 20 – 30 people standing at the bow , among them a man with a white peaked cap . Normally on a German naval vessel at sea , a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer . In addition , the surviving <unk> — Rudolf Römer , who at the time was already in the water — claimed that he had seen Lindemann standing on the bow , near Bismarck 's forward 38 cm turret , Anton . He was said to be with his combat messenger , a leading seaman , and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself . In this account , his messenger took Lindemann 's hand and the two walked to the forward <unk> . As the ship turned over , the two stood briefly to attention , then Lindemann and his messenger saluted . As the ship rolled to port , the messenger fell into the water . Lindemann , continued his salute while clinging to the <unk> , going under with the ship . 
 On Wednesday , 28 May 1941 Ernst Lindemann was posthumously mentioned in the daily Wehrmachtbericht , an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht ( the unified armed forces of Germany ) . To be singled out individually in the Wehrmachtbericht was an honour and was entered in the Orders and Decorations ' section of one 's Service Record Book .

 Lindemann 's comrades of Crew 1913 all contacted the young widow after his death . The former head of Crew 1913 , Captain Otto Klüber , contacted Mrs Lindemann in the fall of 1941 and offered her an honorary membership . Shortly after Christmas on 27 December 1941 , exactly seven months after the sinking of Bismarck and the death of its commander , Captain Ernst Lindemann received a posthumous Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross . He received this high award because the Oberkommando der Marine felt that his skilled leadership significantly contributed to the destruction of the British battlecruiser Hood and the damage inflicted on the British battleship Prince of Wales . Lindemann was the 94th recipient of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross in the Kriegsmarine . 
 Lindemann 's first gunnery officer — Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider — had been awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross on 27 May 1941 . Traditionally , the commanding officer would have received this award before any other crew member was so honoured . This exception had been criticized by various circles in the Wehrmacht . It is thought likely that Ernst Lindemann 's cousin , the former General der <unk> ( General of the Cavalry ) Georg Lindemann , intervened . Grand Admiral Erich Raeder , with whom Lindemann shared a 20 @-@ year comradeship dating to the early days of the Reichsmarine , presented the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross to Mrs Lindemann on Tuesday , 6 January 1942 , in Dahlem . Raeder went on to provide moral and emotional support to Lindemann 's mother and widow .
