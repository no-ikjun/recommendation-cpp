 = 1st SAS Brigade = 
 The 1st Special Air Service Brigade ( 1st SAS ) was a fictional brigade during the Second World War . It was first formed in Cairo in 1941 , as part of a deception by Brigadier Dudley Clarke , to play on Italian fears of airborne attacks . Clarke used documents , photographs , news reports and even fake SAS soldiers to plant information about the brigade – he even named the Cairo @-@ based deception department , ' A ' Force , to bolster evidence of their existence . 
 In the summer of 1941 , when David Stirling was pitching his idea for a dedicated airborne commando unit ( which later evolved into the Special Air Service ) he obtained Clarke 's support partly by promising to use the SAS name . From late 1942 , Clarke used the 1st SAS in his major order of battle deception ( codenamed Operation Cascade ) . The brigade formed part of the fictional 4th Airborne Division ; between then and the end of the war it was used to mislead Axis commanders about the strength of Allied forces in North Africa , and as part of several specific tactical deceptions .

 In late 1940 the Allies recovered the journal of an Italian officer during an operation at Sidi Barrani . The diary referred to fears of British paratroopers being landed to the Italian rear . At the time the Allies had no airborne troops in the North African region . Dudley Clarke , in charge of military deception in the region , decided to play on these fears by creating a fictional airborne unit . Clarke began Operation Abeam in January 1941 by creating a paper trail for the 1st SAS Brigade . The fictional unit was supposedly training for special missions in Transjordan . Clarke established their existence using documentary and physical subterfuge . Photographs of parachutists were printed in local papers , documents were planted with the enemy , Allied airmen were warned to look out for gliders ( Victor Jones mocked up some dummies to support the story ) , and a section of desert was cordoned off for " training " . To aid the rumours , two soldiers were dressed in 1st SAS uniforms and wandered around the Allied @-@ held cities of Cairo , Port Said , and Alexandria , where they were briefed to hint at missions in Crete or Libya . 
 By March , Clarke 's deception operations had grown and it was decided to create a formal department . He chose the name Advanced Headquarters ' A ' Force - the ' A ' being a subtle reference to airborne - in the hope that it would help support the existence of paratroopers in the area ( as well as hide the true purpose of the department ) . Clarke continued actively promoting the existence of 1st SAS until around June 1941 , and it appears that Axis commanders accepted the brigade as real . Clarke had created the unit with no specific aims , although it did mean that the enemy command had to factor the existence of airborne troops into any battle plan . However , Abeam and the 1st SAS represented his first attempt at inflating the apparent strength of Allied forces , a tactic he would use significantly over the rest of the war . The brigade occasionally featured in Clarke 's tactical deceptions ; such as a March 1941 threat to Axis supply lines near Tripoli . 
 = = = Stirling 's SAS = = = 
 In May 1941 , David Stirling , an injured British forces Commando in the North Africa theatre , proposed the idea of small airborne special forces units to operate behind enemy lines . Whilst lobbying for support within Middle East Command it came to Clarke 's attention , who offered his backing provided the force could also be used to help his own deception schemes . 
 The name SAS came mainly from the fact I was anxious to get the full co @-@ operation of a very ingenious individual called Dudley Clark [ e ] , who was responsible for running a deception operation in Cairo ... Clark [ e ] was quite an influential chap and promised to give me all the help he could if I would use the name of his bogus brigade of parachutists , which is the Special Air Service , the SAS 
 Stirling 's plan received approval in the summer of 1941 and the unit was designated " L " Detachment , Special Air Service . The name was intended to add further evidence of an airborne presence , specifically 1st SAS , in the region . 
 = = 4th Airborne = = 
 Through 1941 and 1942 , 1st SAS formed part of Clarke 's overall strategy to deceive the Axis about the strength of Allied forces in the region . In early 1942 , this ad hoc situation was formalised as Operation Cascade ; an entire fictional order of battle featuring numerous units . 
 By late 1942 , the Allies had begun to train a number of real airborne units in the North African theatre . Clarke created the fictional 4th Airborne Division out of several units , both real and fictional , including 1st SAS . Under the umbrella of Cascade , the aim was to mislead the Axis that paratroopers , most of whom were still training , posed a realistic threat . The 4th Airborne were utilised in a number of specific operational deceptions over the next few years ( including Operation Zeppelin and Operation Barclay ) , most often to threaten fictional invasions as a distraction from real Allied operations . 
 = Triangulum Australe = 
 Triangulum Australe is a small constellation in the far Southern Celestial Hemisphere . Its name is Latin for " the southern triangle " , which distinguishes it from Triangulum in the northern sky and is derived from the almost equilateral pattern of its three brightest stars . It was first depicted on a celestial globe as Triangulus <unk> by Petrus Plancius in 1589 , and later with more accuracy and its current name by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria . The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and gave the brighter stars their Bayer designations in 1756 . 
 Alpha Trianguli Australis , known as Atria , is a second magnitude orange giant and the brightest star in the constellation , as well as the 42nd @-@ brightest star in the night sky . Completing the triangle are the two white main sequence stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli Australis . Although the constellation lies in the Milky Way and contains many stars , deep @-@ sky objects are not prominent . Notable features include the open cluster NGC 6025 and planetary nebula NGC <unk> .

 Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci explored the New World at the beginning of the 16th century . He learnt to recognize the stars in the southern hemisphere and made a catalogue for his patron king Manuel I of Portugal , which is now lost . As well as the catalogue , Vespucci wrote descriptions of the southern stars , including a triangle which may be either Triangulum Australe or Apus . This was sent to his patron in Florence , Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de ' Medici , and published as Mundus Novus in 1504 . The first depiction of the constellation was provided in 1589 by Flemish astronomer and clergyman Petrus Plancius on a 32 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ cm diameter celestial globe published in Amsterdam by Dutch cartographer Jacob Floris van Langren , where it was called Triangulus <unk> and incorrectly portrayed to the south of Argo Navis . His student Petrus Keyzer , along with Dutch explorer Frederick de Houtman , coined the name Den <unk> <unk> . Triangulum Australe was more accurately depicted in Johann Bayer 's celestial atlas Uranometria in 1603 , where it was also given its current name . 
 Nicolas Louis de Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma , Circinus and Triangulum Australe as a set square and ruler , a compass , and a surveyor 's level respectively in a set of draughtsman 's instruments in his 1756 map of the southern stars . Also depicting it as a surveyor 's level , German Johann Bode gave it the alternate name of <unk> in his <unk> . 
 German poet and author Philippus Caesius saw the three main stars as representing the Three Patriarchs , Abraham , Isaac and Jacob ( with Atria as Abraham ) . The Wardaman people of the Northern Territory in Australia perceived the stars of Triangulum Australe as the tail of the Rainbow Serpent , which stretched out from near Crux across to Scorpius . Overhead in October , the Rainbow Serpent " gives Lightning a nudge " to bring on the wet season rains in November .

 Triangulum Australe is a small constellation bordered by Norma to the north , Circinus to the west , Apus to the south and Ara to the east . It lies near the Pointers ( Alpha and Beta Centauri ) , with only Circinus in between . The constellation is located within the Milky Way , and hence has many stars . A roughly equilateral triangle , it is easily identifiable . Triangulum Australe lies too far south in the celestial southern hemisphere to be visible from Europe , yet is circumpolar from most of the southern hemisphere . The three @-@ letter abbreviation for the constellation , as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922 , is " <unk> " . The official constellation boundaries , as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined by a polygon of 18 segments . In the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between <unk> <unk> and 17h <unk> , while the declination coordinates are between − 60 @.@ 26 ° and − 70 @.@ 51 ° . Triangulum Australe culminates each year at 9 p.m. on 23 August .

 In defining the constellation , Lacaille gave twelve stars Bayer designations of Alpha through to Lambda , with two close stars called Eta ( one now known by its Henry Draper catalogue number ) , while Lambda was later dropped due to its dimness .

 = Tyrannosaurus = 
 Tyrannosaurus ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / , meaning " tyrant lizard " , from the Ancient Greek tyrannos ( <unk> ) , " tyrant " , and sauros ( σαῦρος ) , " lizard " ) is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur . The species Tyrannosaurus rex ( rex meaning " king " in Latin ) , is one of the most well @-@ represented of the large theropods . Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America , on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia . Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids . Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the upper Cretaceous Period , 68 to 66 million years ago . It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids , and among the last non @-@ avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event . 
 Like other tyrannosaurids , Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long , heavy tail . Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs , Tyrannosaurus fore limbs were short but unusually powerful for their size and had two clawed digits . The most complete specimen measures up to 12 @.@ 3 m ( 40 ft ) in length , up to 3 @.@ 66 meters ( 12 ft ) tall at the hips , and up to 10 @.@ 2 metric tons ( 11 @.@ 2 short tons ) in weight . Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size , it is still among the largest known land predators and is estimated to have exerted the largest bite force among all terrestrial animals . By far the largest carnivore in its environment , Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an apex predator , preying upon hadrosaurs , ceratopsians , and possibly sauropods . Some experts , however , have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger . The question of whether Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest ongoing debates in paleontology . It is accepted now that Tyrannosaurus rex acted as a predator , and scavenged as modern mammalian and avian predators do . 
 More than 50 specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex have been identified , some of which are nearly complete skeletons . Soft tissue and proteins have been reported in at least one of these specimens . The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology , including its life history and biomechanics . The feeding habits , physiology and potential speed of Tyrannosaurus rex are a few subjects of debate . Its taxonomy is also controversial , as some scientists consider Tarbosaurus bataar from Asia to be a second Tyrannosaurus species while others maintain Tarbosaurus is a separate genus . Several other genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been synonymized with Tyrannosaurus . 
 = = Description = = 
 Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the largest land carnivores of all time ; the largest complete specimen , located at the Field Museum of Natural History under the name FMNH PR2081 and nicknamed Sue , measured 12 @.@ 3 meters ( 40 ft ) long , and was 3 @.@ 66 meters ( 12 ft ) tall at the hips . Mass estimates have varied widely over the years , from more than 7 @.@ 2 metric tons ( 7 @.@ 9 short tons ) , to less than 4 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 5 @.@ 0 short tons ) , with most modern estimates ranging between 5 @.@ 4 metric tons ( 6 @.@ 0 short tons ) and 6 @.@ 7 metric tons ( 7 @.@ 4 short tons ) . One study in 2011 found that the maximum weight of Sue , the largest Tyrannosaurus , was between 9 @.@ 5 and 18 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 9 @.@ 3 – 18 @.@ 2 long tons ; 10 @.@ 5 – 20 @.@ 4 short tons ) , though the authors stated that their upper and lower estimates were based on models with wide error bars and that they " consider [ them ] to be too skinny , too fat , or too disproportionate " . Packard et al . ( 2009 ) tested dinosaur mass estimation procedures on elephants and concluded that those of dinosaurs are flawed and produce over @-@ estimations ; thus , the weight of Tyrannosaurus could have been much less than previously thought . Other estimations have concluded that the largest known Tyrannosaurus specimens had masses approaching or exceeding 9 tonnes . 
 The neck of Tyrannosaurus rex formed a natural S @-@ shaped curve like that of other theropods , but was short and muscular to support the massive head . The forelimbs had only two clawed fingers , along with an additional small metacarpal representing the remnant of a third digit . In contrast the hind limbs were among the longest in proportion to body size of any theropod . The tail was heavy and long , sometimes containing over forty vertebrae , in order to balance the massive head and torso . To compensate for the immense bulk of the animal , many bones throughout the skeleton were hollow , reducing its weight without significant loss of strength . 
 The largest known Tyrannosaurus rex skulls measure up to 1 @.@ 45 meters ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) in length . Large fenestrae ( openings ) in the skull reduced weight and provided areas for muscle attachment , as in all carnivorous theropods . But in other respects Tyrannosaurus 's skull was significantly different from those of large non @-@ tyrannosauroid theropods . It was extremely wide at the rear but had a narrow snout , allowing unusually good binocular vision . The skull bones were massive and the nasals and some other bones were fused , preventing movement between them ; but many were <unk> ( contained a " honeycomb " of tiny air spaces ) which may have made the bones more flexible as well as lighter . These and other skull @-@ strengthening features are part of the tyrannosaurid trend towards an increasingly powerful bite , which easily surpassed that of all non @-@ tyrannosaurids . The tip of the upper jaw was U @-@ shaped ( most non @-@ tyrannosauroid carnivores had V @-@ shaped upper jaws ) , which increased the amount of tissue and bone a tyrannosaur could rip out with one bite , although it also increased the stresses on the front teeth . 
 The teeth of Tyrannosaurus rex displayed marked heterodonty ( differences in shape ) . The premaxillary teeth at the front of the upper jaw were closely packed , D @-@ shaped in cross @-@ section , had reinforcing ridges on the rear surface , were incisiform ( their tips were chisel @-@ like blades ) and curved backwards . The D @-@ shaped cross @-@ section , reinforcing ridges and backwards curve reduced the risk that the teeth would snap when Tyrannosaurus bit and pulled . The remaining teeth were robust , like " lethal bananas " rather than daggers , more widely spaced and also had reinforcing ridges . Those in the upper jaw were larger than those in all but the rear of the lower jaw . The largest found so far is estimated to have been 30 @.@ 5 centimeters ( 12 in ) long including the root when the animal was alive , making it the largest tooth of any carnivorous dinosaur yet found . 
 = = = Skin and feathers = = = 
 While there is no direct evidence for Tyrannosaurus rex having had feathers , many scientists now consider it likely that T. rex had feathers on at least parts of its body , due to their presence in related species of similar size . Mark Norell of the American Museum of Natural History summarized the balance of evidence by stating that : " we have as much evidence that T. rex was feathered , at least during some stage of its life , as we do that australopithecines like Lucy had hair . " 
 The first evidence for feathers in tyrannosauroids came from the small species Dilong paradoxus , found in the Yixian Formation of China , and reported in the journal Nature in 2004 . As with many other theropods discovered in the Yixian , the fossil skeleton was preserved with a coat of filamentous structures which are commonly recognized as the precursors of feathers . Because all known skin impressions from larger tyrannosauroids known at the time showed evidence of scales , the researchers who studied Dilong speculated that feathers may correlate negatively with body size — that juveniles may have been feathered , then shed the feathers and expressed only scales as the animal became larger and no longer needed insulation to stay warm . However , subsequent discoveries showed that even some gigantic tyrannosauroids had feathers covering much of their bodies , casting doubt on the hypothesis that they were a size @-@ related feature . 
 While skin impressions from a Tyrannosaurus rex specimen nicknamed " <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> ) discovered in Montana in 2002 , as well as some other giant tyrannosauroid specimens , show at least small patches of mosaic scales , others , such as Yutyrannus <unk> ( which was up to 9 meters ( 30 ft ) long and weighed about 1 @,@ 400 kilograms ( 3 @,@ 100 lb ) ) , preserve feathers on various sections of the body , strongly suggesting that its whole body was covered in feathers . It is possible that the extent and nature of feather covering in tyrannosauroids may have changed over time in response to body size , a warmer climate , or other factors . 
 Research has suggested that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards , rather than having bare teeth like crocodiles . This is based on the presence of enamel , which needs to remain hydrated , an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds , which have <unk> and toothless beaks . In modern terrestrial animals with bare teeth , the teeth typically lack some or all of the standard amount of tooth enamel . Because Tyrannosaurus and other toothed theropods had enamel @-@ covered teeth , they would have required some sort of lip @-@ like covering to seal the mouth when closed . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Tyrannosaurus is the type genus of the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea , the family Tyrannosauridae , and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae ; in other words it is the standard by which paleontologists decide whether to include other species in the same group . Other members of the tyrannosaurine subfamily include the North American Daspletosaurus and the Asian Tarbosaurus , both of which have occasionally been synonymized with Tyrannosaurus . Tyrannosaurids were once commonly thought to be descendants of earlier large theropods such as <unk> and carnosaurs , although more recently they were reclassified with the generally smaller coelurosaurs . 
 In 1955 , Soviet paleontologist Evgeny Maleev named a new species , Tyrannosaurus bataar , from Mongolia . By 1965 , this species had been renamed Tarbosaurus bataar . Despite the renaming , many phylogenetic analyses have found Tarbosaurus bataar to be the sister taxon of Tyrannosaurus rex , and it has often been considered an Asian species of Tyrannosaurus . A recent redescription of the skull of Tarbosaurus bataar has shown that it was much narrower than that of Tyrannosaurus rex and that during a bite , the distribution of stress in the skull would have been very different , closer to that of Alioramus , another Asian tyrannosaur . A related cladistic analysis found that Alioramus , not Tyrannosaurus , was the sister taxon of Tarbosaurus , which , if true , would suggest that Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus should remain separate . The discovery and description of Qianzhousaurus would later disprove this and revealed that Alioramus belonged to the clade Alioramini . The discovery of the tyrannosaurid Lythronax further indicates that Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus are closely related , forming a clade with fellow Asian tyrannosaurid Zhuchengtyrannus , with Lythronax being their sister taxon . A further study , published in the journal Scientific Reports on February 2 , 2016 by Steve Brusatte , Thomas Carr et al . , also indicates Tyrannosaurus may have been an immigrant from Asia , as well as a possible descendent of Tarbosaurus . The study further indicates the possibility that Tyrannosaurus may have driven other tyrannosaurids that were native to North America extinct through competition . 
 Other tyrannosaurid fossils found in the same formations as Tyrannosaurus rex were originally classified as separate taxa , including Aublysodon and Albertosaurus megagracilis , the latter being named <unk> megagracilis in 1995 . However , these fossils are now universally considered to belong to juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex . A small but nearly complete skull from Montana , 60 centimeters ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) long , may be an exception . This skull was originally classified as a species of Gorgosaurus ( G. lancensis ) by Charles W. Gilmore in 1946 , but was later referred to a new genus , Nanotyrannus . Opinions remain divided on the validity of N. lancensis . Many paleontologists consider the skull to belong to a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex . There are minor differences between the two species , including the higher number of teeth in N. lancensis , which lead some scientists to recommend keeping the two genera separate until further research or discoveries clarify the situation . 
 Below is the cladogram of Tyrannosauridae based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Loewen et al. in 2013 . 
 = = Paleobiology = = 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 The identification of several specimens as juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex has allowed scientists to document ontogenetic changes in the species , estimate the lifespan , and determine how quickly the animals would have grown . The smallest known individual ( LACM 28471 , the " Jordan theropod " ) is estimated to have weighed only 30 kg ( 66 lb ) , while the largest , such as FMNH PR2081 ( Sue ) most likely weighed about 5 @,@ 650 kg ( 12 @,@ 460 lb ) . <unk> analysis of Tyrannosaurus rex bones showed LACM 28471 had aged only 2 years when it died , while Sue was 28 years old , an age which may have been close to the maximum for the species . 
 Histology has also allowed the age of other specimens to be determined . Growth curves can be developed when the ages of different specimens are plotted on a graph along with their mass . A Tyrannosaurus rex growth curve is S @-@ shaped , with juveniles remaining under 1 @,@ 800 kg ( 4 @,@ 000 lb ) until approximately 14 years of age , when body size began to increase dramatically . During this rapid growth phase , a young Tyrannosaurus rex would gain an average of 600 kg ( 1 @,@ 300 lb ) a year for the next four years . At 18 years of age , the curve plateaus again , indicating that growth slowed dramatically . For example , only 600 kg ( 1 @,@ 300 lb ) separated the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Sue from a 22 @-@ year @-@ old Canadian specimen ( RTMP 81 @.@ 12 @.@ 1 ) . A 2004 histological study performed by different workers corroborates these results , finding that rapid growth began to slow at around 16 years of age . Another study corroborated the latter study 's results but found the growth rate to be much faster , finding it to be around 1800 kilograms ( 4000 lbs ) . Although these results were much higher than previous estimations , the authors noted that these results significantly lowered the great difference between its actual growth rate and the one which would be expected of an animal of its size . The sudden change in growth rate at the end of the growth spurt may indicate physical maturity , a hypothesis which is supported by the discovery of medullary tissue in the femur of a 16 to 20 @-@ year @-@ old Tyrannosaurus rex from Montana ( MOR 1125 , also known as B @-@ rex ) . Medullary tissue is found only in female birds during ovulation , indicating that B @-@ rex was of reproductive age . Further study indicates an age of 18 for this specimen . In 2016 , it was finally confirmed by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay <unk> et al that the soft tissue within the femur of MOR 1125 was medullary tissue . This also confirmed the identity of the specimen as a female . The discovery of medullary bone tissue within Tyrannosaurus may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations , as the chemical makeup of medullary tissue is unmistakable . Other tyrannosaurids exhibit extremely similar growth curves , although with lower growth rates corresponding to their lower adult sizes . 
 Over half of the known Tyrannosaurus rex specimens appear to have died within six years of reaching sexual maturity , a pattern which is also seen in other tyrannosaurs and in some large , long @-@ lived birds and mammals today . These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates , followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles . Mortality increases again following sexual maturity , partly due to the stresses of reproduction . One study suggests that the rarity of juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex fossils is due in part to low juvenile mortality rates ; the animals were not dying in large numbers at these ages , and so were not often fossilized . However , this rarity may also be due to the incompleteness of the fossil record or to the bias of fossil collectors towards larger , more spectacular specimens . In a 2013 lecture , Thomas Holtz Jr. would suggest that dinosaurs " lived fast and died young " because they reproduced quickly whereas mammals have long life spans because they take longer to reproduce . Gregory S. Paul also writes that Tyrannosaurus reproduced quickly and died young , but attributes their short life spans to the dangerous lives they lived .

 As the number of known specimens increased , scientists began to analyze the variation between individuals and discovered what appeared to be two distinct body types , or morphs , similar to some other theropod species . As one of these morphs was more solidly built , it was termed the ' robust ' morph while the other was termed ' gracile ' . Several morphological differences associated with the two morphs were used to analyze sexual dimorphism in Tyrannosaurus rex , with the ' robust ' morph usually suggested to be female . For example , the pelvis of several ' robust ' specimens seemed to be wider , perhaps to allow the passage of eggs . It was also thought that the ' robust ' morphology correlated with a reduced chevron on the first tail vertebra , also ostensibly to allow eggs to pass out of the reproductive tract , as had been erroneously reported for crocodiles . 
 In recent years , evidence for sexual dimorphism has been weakened . A 2005 study reported that previous claims of sexual dimorphism in crocodile chevron anatomy were in error , casting doubt on the existence of similar dimorphism between Tyrannosaurus rex sexes . A full @-@ sized chevron was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue , an extremely robust individual , indicating that this feature could not be used to differentiate the two morphs anyway . As Tyrannosaurus rex specimens have been found from Saskatchewan to New Mexico , differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism . The differences could also be age @-@ related , with ' robust ' individuals being older animals . 
 Only a single Tyrannosaurus rex specimen has been conclusively shown to belong to a specific sex . Examination of B @-@ rex demonstrated the preservation of soft tissue within several bones . Some of this tissue has been identified as a medullary tissue , a specialized tissue grown only in modern birds as a source of calcium for the production of eggshell during ovulation . As only female birds lay eggs , medullary tissue is only found naturally in females , although males are capable of producing it when injected with female reproductive hormones like estrogen . This strongly suggests that B @-@ rex was female , and that she died during ovulation . Recent research has shown that medullary tissue is never found in crocodiles , which are thought to be the closest living relatives of dinosaurs , aside from birds . The shared presence of medullary tissue in birds and theropod dinosaurs is further evidence of the close evolutionary relationship between the two . 
 = = = Posture = = = 
 Modern representations in museums , art , and film show Tyrannosaurus rex with its body approximately parallel to the ground and tail extended behind the body to balance the head . 
 Like many bipedal dinosaurs , Tyrannosaurus rex was historically depicted as a ' living tripod ' , with the body at 45 degrees or less from the vertical and the tail dragging along the ground , similar to a kangaroo . This concept dates from Joseph Leidy 's 1865 reconstruction of Hadrosaurus , the first to depict a dinosaur in a bipedal posture . In 1915 , convinced that the creature stood upright , Henry Fairfield Osborn , former president of the American Museum of Natural History , further reinforced the notion in unveiling the first complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton arranged this way . It stood in an upright pose for 77 years , until it was dismantled in 1992 . 
 By 1970 , scientists realized this pose was incorrect and could not have been maintained by a living animal , as it would have resulted in the dislocation or weakening of several joints , including the hips and the articulation between the head and the spinal column . The inaccurate AMNH mount inspired similar depictions in many films and paintings ( such as Rudolph Zallinger 's famous mural The Age of Reptiles in Yale University 's Peabody Museum of Natural History ) until the 1990s , when films such as Jurassic Park introduced a more accurate posture to the general public . 
 = = = Arms = = = 
 When Tyrannosaurus rex was first discovered , the humerus was the only element of the forelimb known . For the initial mounted skeleton as seen by the public in 1915 , Osborn substituted longer , three @-@ fingered forelimbs like those of Allosaurus . However , a year earlier , Lawrence Lambe described the short , two @-@ fingered forelimbs of the closely related Gorgosaurus . This strongly suggested that Tyrannosaurus rex had similar forelimbs , but this hypothesis was not confirmed until the first complete Tyrannosaurus rex forelimbs were identified in 1989 , belonging to MOR 555 ( the " Wankel rex " ) . The remains of Sue also include complete forelimbs . Tyrannosaurus rex arms are very small relative to overall body size , measuring only 1 meter ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) long , and some scholars have labelled them as vestigial . However , the bones show large areas for muscle attachment , indicating considerable strength . This was recognized as early as 1906 by Osborn , who speculated that the forelimbs may have been used to grasp a mate during copulation . It has also been suggested that the forelimbs were used to assist the animal in rising from a prone position . 
 Another possibility is that the forelimbs held struggling prey while it was killed by the tyrannosaur 's enormous jaws . This hypothesis may be supported by biomechanical analysis . Tyrannosaurus rex forelimb bones exhibit extremely thick cortical bone , which have been interpreted as evidence that they were developed to withstand heavy loads . The biceps brachii muscle of a full @-@ grown Tyrannosaurus rex was capable of lifting 199 kilograms ( 439 lb ) by itself ; other muscles such as the brachialis would work along with the biceps to make elbow flexion even more powerful . The M. biceps muscle of T. rex was 3 @.@ 5 times as powerful as the human equivalent . A Tyrannosaurus rex forearm had a limited range of motion , with the shoulder and elbow joints allowing only 40 and 45 degrees of motion , respectively . In contrast , the same two joints in Deinonychus allow up to 88 and 130 degrees of motion , respectively , while a human arm can rotate 360 degrees at the shoulder and move through 165 degrees at the elbow . The heavy build of the arm bones , strength of the muscles , and limited range of motion may indicate a system evolved to hold fast despite the stresses of a struggling prey animal . In the first detailed scientific description of Tyrannosaurus forelimbs , paleontologists Kenneth Carpenter and Matt Smith dismissed notions that the forelimbs were useless or that Tyrannosaurus rex was an obligate scavenger . 
 = = = Soft tissue = = = 
 In the March 2005 issue of Science , Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University and colleagues announced the recovery of soft tissue from the marrow cavity of a fossilized leg bone from a Tyrannosaurus rex . The bone had been intentionally , though reluctantly , broken for shipping and then not preserved in the normal manner , specifically because Schweitzer was hoping to test it for soft tissue . Designated as the Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125 , or MOR 1125 , the dinosaur was previously excavated from the Hell Creek Formation . Flexible , bifurcating blood vessels and fibrous but elastic bone matrix tissue were recognized . In addition , microstructures resembling blood cells were found inside the matrix and vessels . The structures bear resemblance to ostrich blood cells and vessels . Whether an unknown process , distinct from normal fossilization , preserved the material , or the material is original , the researchers do not know , and they are careful not to make any claims about preservation . If it is found to be original material , any surviving proteins may be used as a means of indirectly guessing some of the DNA content of the dinosaurs involved , because each protein is typically created by a specific gene . The absence of previous finds may be the result of people assuming preserved tissue was impossible , therefore not looking . Since the first , two more tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur have also been found to have such tissue @-@ like structures . Research on some of the tissues involved has suggested that birds are closer relatives to tyrannosaurs than other modern animals . 
 In studies reported in Science in April 2007 , <unk> and colleagues concluded that seven traces of collagen proteins detected in purified Tyrannosaurus rex bone most closely match those reported in chickens , followed by frogs and newts . The discovery of proteins from a creature tens of millions of years old , along with similar traces the team found in a mastodon bone at least 160 @,@ 000 years old , upends the conventional view of fossils and may shift paleontologists ' focus from bone hunting to biochemistry . Until these finds , most scientists presumed that fossilization replaced all living tissue with inert minerals . Paleontologist Hans Larsson of McGill University in Montreal , who was not part of the studies , called the finds " a milestone " , and suggested that dinosaurs could " enter the field of molecular biology and really slingshot paleontology into the modern world " . 
 Subsequent studies in April 2008 confirmed the close connection of Tyrannosaurus rex to modern birds . Postdoctoral biology researcher Chris Organ at Harvard University announced , " With more data , they would probably be able to place T. rex on the evolutionary tree between alligators and chickens and ostriches . " Co @-@ author John M. <unk> added , " We also show that it groups better with birds than modern reptiles , such as alligators and green anole lizards . " 
 The presumed soft tissue was called into question by Thomas Kaye of the University of Washington and his co @-@ authors in 2008 . They contend that what was really inside the tyrannosaur bone was slimy biofilm created by bacteria that coated the voids once occupied by blood vessels and cells . The researchers found that what previously had been identified as remnants of blood cells , because of the presence of iron , were actually <unk> , microscopic mineral spheres bearing iron . They found similar spheres in a variety of other fossils from various periods , including an ammonite . In the ammonite they found the spheres in a place where the iron they contain could not have had any relationship to the presence of blood . However , Schweitzer has strongly criticized Kaye 's claims and argues that there 's no reported evidence that biofilms can produce branching , hollow tubes like those noted in her study . San Antonio , Schweitzer and colleagues published an analysis in 2011 of what parts of the collagen had been recovered , finding that it was the inner parts of the collagen coil that had been preserved , as would have been expected from a long period of protein degradation . Other research challenges the identification of soft tissue as biofilm and confirms finding " branching , vessel @-@ like structures " from within fossilized bone . 
 = = = Thermoregulation = = = 
 As of 2014 , it is not clear if Tyrannosaurus was endothermic ( warm @-@ blooded ) . Tyrannosaurus , like most dinosaurs , was long thought to have an ectothermic ( " cold @-@ blooded " ) reptilian metabolism . The idea of dinosaur ectothermy was challenged by scientists like Robert T. Bakker and John Ostrom in the early years of the " Dinosaur Renaissance " , beginning in the late 1960s . Tyrannosaurus rex itself was claimed to have been endothermic ( " warm @-@ blooded " ) , implying a very active lifestyle . Since then , several paleontologists have sought to determine the ability of Tyrannosaurus to regulate its body temperature . Histological evidence of high growth rates in young Tyrannosaurus rex , comparable to those of mammals and birds , may support the hypothesis of a high metabolism . Growth curves indicate that , as in mammals and birds , Tyrannosaurus rex growth was limited mostly to immature animals , rather than the indeterminate growth seen in most other vertebrates . 
 Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are sometimes used to determine the temperature at which the bone was deposited , as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature . In one specimen , the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than 4 to 5 ° C ( 7 to 9 ° F ) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg . This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature ( homeothermy ) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals . Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past , and may have been altered during or after fossilization ( diagenesis ) . Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers , finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time ( Giganotosaurus ) . <unk> dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy , while varanid lizards from the same formation did not . Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy , it does not necessarily mean that it was endothermic . Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy , as in some living sea turtles . 
 = = = Footprints = = = 
 Two isolated fossilized footprints have been tentatively assigned to Tyrannosaurus rex . The first was discovered at Philmont Scout Ranch , New Mexico , in 1983 by American geologist Charles <unk> . Originally thought to belong to a hadrosaurid , examination of the footprint revealed a large ' heel ' unknown in ornithopod dinosaur tracks , and traces of what may have been a hallux , the dewclaw @-@ like fourth digit of the tyrannosaur foot . The footprint was published as the ichnogenus <unk> <unk> in 1994 , by Martin Lockley and Adrian Hunt . Lockley and Hunt suggested that it was very likely the track was made by a Tyrannosaurus rex , which would make it the first known footprint from this species . The track was made in what was once a vegetated wetland mud flat . It measures 83 centimeters ( 33 in ) long by 71 centimeters ( 28 in ) wide . 
 A second footprint that may have been made by a Tyrannosaurus was first reported in 2007 by British paleontologist Phil Manning , from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana . This second track measures 72 centimeters ( 28 in ) long , shorter than the track described by Lockley and Hunt . Whether or not the track was made by Tyrannosaurus is unclear , though Tyrannosaurus and Nanotyrannus are the only large theropods known to have existed in the Hell Creek Formation . 
 A set of footprints in <unk> , Wyoming dating to the Maastrichtian stage of the late cretaceous and hailing from the Lance Formation were recently described by Scott Persons , Phil Currie et al. in January 2016 , and are believed to belong to either a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex or the dubious tyrannosaurid genus Nanotyrannus lancensis . From measurements and based on the positions of the footprints , the animal was believed to be traveling at a walking speed of around 2 @.@ 8 to 5 miles per hour and was estimated to have a hip height of 1 @.@ 56 m ( 5 @.@ 1 ft ) to 2 @.@ 06 m ( 6 @.@ 8 ft ) . The discovery was described in the journal Cretaceous Research . 
 = = = Locomotion = = = 
 There are two main issues concerning the locomotory abilities of Tyrannosaurus : how well it could turn ; and what its maximum straight @-@ line speed was likely to have been . Both are relevant to the debate about whether it was a hunter or a scavenger . 
 Tyrannosaurus may have been slow to turn , possibly taking one to two seconds to turn only 45 ° — an amount that humans , being vertically oriented and tailless , can spin in a fraction of a second . The cause of the difficulty is rotational inertia , since much of Tyrannosaurus ' mass was some distance from its center of gravity , like a human carrying a heavy timber horizontally — although it might have reduced the average distance by arching its back and tail and pulling its head and forelimbs close to its body , rather like the way ice skaters pull their arms closer in order to spin faster . 
 Scientists have produced a wide range of maximum speed estimates , mostly around 11 meters per second ( 40 km / h ; 25 mph ) , but a few as low as 5 – 11 meters per second ( 18 – 40 km / h ; 11 – 25 mph ) , and a few as high as 20 meters per second ( 72 km / h ; 45 mph ) . Researchers have to rely on various estimating techniques because , while there are many tracks of very large theropods walking , so far none have been found of very large theropods running — and this absence may indicate that they did not run . Scientists who think that Tyrannosaurus was able to run point out that hollow bones and other features that would have lightened its body may have kept adult weight to a mere 4 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 5 @.@ 0 short tons ) or so , or that other animals like ostriches and horses with long , flexible legs are able to achieve high speeds through slower but longer strides . Additionally , some have argued that Tyrannosaurus had relatively larger leg muscles than any animal alive today , which could have enabled fast running at 40 – 70 kilometers per hour ( 25 – 43 mph ) . 
 Jack Horner and Don Lessem argued in 1993 that Tyrannosaurus was slow and probably could not run ( no airborne phase in mid @-@ stride ) , because its ratio of femur ( thigh bone ) to tibia ( shin bone ) length was greater than 1 , as in most large theropods and like a modern elephant . However , Holtz ( 1998 ) noted that tyrannosaurids and some closely related groups had significantly longer distal hindlimb components ( shin plus foot plus toes ) relative to the femur length than most other theropods , and that tyrannosaurids and their close relatives had a tightly interlocked metatarsus that more effectively transmitted locomotory forces from the foot to the lower leg than in earlier theropods ( " metatarsus " means the foot bones , which function as part of the leg in digitigrade animals ) . He therefore concluded that tyrannosaurids and their close relatives were the fastest large theropods . Thomas Holtz Jr. would echo these sentiments in his 2013 lecture , stating that the giant allosaurs had shorter feet for the same body size than Tyrannosaurus , whereas Tyrannosaurus had longer , skinnier and more interlocked feet for the same body size ; attributes of faster moving animals . 
 A study by Eric Snively and Anthony P. Russel published in 2003 would also find that the tyrannosaurid <unk> and elastic ligaments worked together in what he called a ' tensile keystone model ' to strengthen the feet of Tyrannosaurus , increase the animal 's stability and add greater resistance to dissociation over that of other theropod families ; while still allowing resiliency that is otherwise reduced in ratites , horses , giraffids and other animals with <unk> to a single element . The study would also point out that elastic ligaments in larger vertebrates could store and return relatively more elastic strain energy , which could have improved locomotor efficiency and decrease the strain energy transferred to the bones . The study would suggest that this mechanism could have worked efficiently in tyrannosaurids as well . Hence , the study involved identifying the type of ligaments attached to the metatarsals , then how they functioned together and comparing it to those of other theropods and modern day analogs . The scientists would find that <unk> may have enabled tyrannosaurid feet to absorb forces such as linear deceleration , lateral acceleration and torsion more effectively than those of other theropods . It is also stated in their study that this may imply , though not demonstrate , that tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus had greater agility than other large theropods without an arctometatarsus . 
 Christiansen ( 1998 ) estimated that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants , which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run ( there is no airborne phase ) , and hence proposed that the dinosaur 's maximum speed would have been about 11 meters per second ( 40 km / h ; 25 mph ) , which is about the speed of a human sprinter . But he also noted that such estimates depend on many dubious assumptions . 
 Farlow and colleagues ( 1995 ) have argued that a Tyrannosaurus weighing 5 @.@ 4 metric tons ( 6 @.@ 0 short tons ) to 7 @.@ 3 metric tons ( 8 @.@ 0 short tons ) would have been critically or even fatally injured if it had fallen while moving quickly , since its torso would have slammed into the ground at a deceleration of 6 g ( six times the acceleration due to gravity , or about 60 meters / s ² ) and its tiny arms could not have reduced the impact . However , giraffes have been known to gallop at 50 kilometers per hour ( 31 mph ) , despite the risk that they might break a leg or worse , which can be fatal even in a " safe " environment such as a zoo . Thus it is possible that Tyrannosaurus also moved fast when necessary and had to accept such risks . 
 In a study published by Gregory S. Paul in the journal Gaia , he would point out that the flexed kneed and digitigrade adult Tyrannosaurus were much better adapted for running than elephants or humans , pointing out that Tyrannosaurus had a large ilium bone and cnemial crest that would have supported large muscles needed for running . He would also mention that Alexander 's ( 1989 ) formula to calculate speed by bone strength was only partly reliable . He suggests that the formula is overly sensitive to bone length ; making long bones artificially weak . He would also point out that the lowered risk of being wounded in combat may have been worth the risk of Tyrannosaurus falling while running . 
 Most recent research on Tyrannosaurus locomotion does not support speeds faster than 40 kilometers per hour ( 25 mph ) , i.e. moderate @-@ speed running . For example , a 2002 paper in Nature used a mathematical model ( validated by applying it to three living animals , alligators , chickens , and humans ; later eight more species including emus and ostriches ) to gauge the leg muscle mass needed for fast running ( over 40 km / h or 25 mph ) . They found that proposed top speeds in excess of 40 kilometers per hour ( 25 mph ) were infeasible , because they would require very large leg muscles ( more than approximately 40 – 86 % of total body mass ) . Even moderately fast speeds would have required large leg muscles . This discussion is difficult to resolve , as it is unknown how large the leg muscles actually were in Tyrannosaurus . If they were smaller , only 18 kilometers per hour ( 11 mph ) walking or jogging might have been possible . 
 A study in 2007 used computer models to estimate running speeds , based on data taken directly from fossils , and claimed that Tyrannosaurus rex had a top running speed of 8 meters per second ( 29 km / h ; 18 mph ) . An average professional football ( soccer ) player would be slightly slower , while a human sprinter can reach 12 meters per second ( 43 km / h ; 27 mph ) . These computer models predict a top speed of 17 @.@ 8 meters per second ( 64 km / h ; 40 mph ) for a 3 @-@ kilogram ( 6 @.@ 6 lb ) Compsognathus ( probably a juvenile individual ) . 
 However , in 2010 , Scott Persons , a graduate student from the University of Alberta proposed that Tyrannosaurus 's speed may have been enhanced by strong tail muscles . He found that theropods such as T rex had certain muscle arrangements that are different from modern day birds and mammals but with some similarities to modern reptiles . He concluded that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the upper leg bones could have assisted Tyrannosaurus in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability , agility and balance . The caudofemoralis muscle would have been a key muscle in femoral retraction ; pulling back the leg at the femur . The study also found that theropod skeletons such as those of Tyrannosaurus had adaptations ( such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae ) to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus 's tail muscle mass may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and perhaps as much as 45 percent . The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent of the muscle mass in the tail of Tyrannosaurus . Tyrannosaurus also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis muscle mass out of the three extinct organisms in the study . This is because Tyrannosaurus also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles ; the elongation of its tail 's hemal arches . According to Persons , the increase in tail muscle mass would have moved the center of mass closer to the hindquarters and hips which would have lessened the strain on the leg muscles to support its weight ; improving its overall balance and agility . This would also have made the animal less front @-@ heavy , thus reducing rotational inertia . Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy , and thereby improved locomotive efficiency . Persons adds that this means non @-@ avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted , as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base . 
 Heinrich Mallison from Berlin 's Museum of Natural History would also present a theory in 2011 , suggesting that Tyrannosaurus and many other dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running , likening their movement to power @-@ walking . This , according to Mallison , would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened the need for additional muscle mass in the legs , particularly at the ankles . To support his theory , Mallison assessed the limbs of various dinosaurs and found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds ; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons , but also having relatively large muscles at the hindquarters . He would however find a few similarities between the muscles in dinosaurs and race @-@ walkers ; having less muscle mass in the ankles but more at the hindquarters . Mallison suggests that the differences between dinosaurs , extant mammals , and birds would also have made equations to calculate speed from stride length inapplicable to dinosaurs . John Hutchinson however advised caution regarding this theory , suggesting that they must first look into dinosaur muscles to see how frequently they could have contracted . 
 Those who argue that Tyrannosaurus was incapable of running estimate the top speed of Tyrannosaurus at about 17 kilometers per hour ( 11 mph ) . This is still faster than its most likely prey species , hadrosaurids and ceratopsians . In addition , some advocates of the idea that Tyrannosaurus was a predator claim that tyrannosaur running speed is not important , since it may have been slow but still faster than its probable prey . Thomas Holtz would also note that Tyrannosaurus had proportionately longer feet than the animals it hunted : duck @-@ billed dinosaurs and horned dinosaurs . However , Paul and Christiansen ( 2000 ) argued that at least the later ceratopsians had upright forelimbs and the larger species may have been as fast as rhinos . Healed Tyrannosaurus bite wounds on ceratopsian fossils are interpreted as evidence of attacks on living ceratopsians ( see below ) . If the ceratopsians that lived alongside Tyrannosaurus were fast , that casts doubt on the argument that Tyrannosaurus did not have to be fast to catch its prey . 
 = = = Brain and senses = = = 
 A study conducted by Lawrence Witmer and Ryan Ridgely of Ohio University found that Tyrannosaurus shared the heightened sensory abilities of other coelurosaurs , highlighting relatively rapid and coordinated eye and head movements , as well as an enhanced ability to sense low frequency sounds that would allow tyrannosaurs to track prey movements from long distances and an enhanced sense of smell . A study published by Kent Stevens of the University of Oregon concluded that Tyrannosaurus had keen vision . By applying modified perimetry to facial reconstructions of several dinosaurs including Tyrannosaurus , the study found that Tyrannosaurus had a binocular range of 55 degrees , surpassing that of modern hawks , and had 13 times the visual acuity of a human , thereby surpassing the visual acuity of an eagle which is only 3 @.@ 6 times that of a person . This would have allowed Tyrannosaurus to discern objects as far as 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) away , which is greater than the 1 @.@ 6 km ( 1 mi ) that a human can see . 
 Thomas Holtz Jr. would note that high depth perception of Tyrannosaurus may have been due to the prey it had to hunt ; noting that it had to hunt horned dinosaurs such as Triceratops , armored dinosaurs such as Ankylosaurus and the duck @-@ billed dinosaurs may have had complex social behaviors . He would suggest that this made precision more crucial for Tyrannosaurus enabling it to , " get in , get that blow in and take it down . " In contrast , Acrocanthosaurus had limited depth perception because they hunted large sauropods , which were relatively rare during the time of Tyrannosaurus . 
 Tyrannosaurus had very large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves relative to their brain size , the organs responsible for a heightened sense of smell . This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed , and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances . The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures , which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging . Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non @-@ avian dinosaur species . 
 Somewhat unusually among theropods , T. rex had a very long cochlea . The length of the cochlea is often related to hearing acuity , or at least the importance of hearing in behavior , implying that hearing was a particularly important sense to tyrannosaurs . Specifically , data suggests that Tyrannosaurus rex heard best in the low @-@ frequency range , and that low @-@ frequency sounds were an important part of tyrannosaur behavior . 
 A study by Grant R. Hurlburt , Ryan C. Ridgely and Lawrence Witmer would obtain estimates for <unk> <unk> ( EQs ) , based on reptiles and birds , as well as estimates for the ratio of cerebrum to brain mass . The study would conclude that Tyrannosaurus had the relatively largest brain of all adult non @-@ avian dinosaurs with the exception of certain small <unk> ( Bambiraptor , Troodon and Ornithomimus ) . The study would however find that Tyrannosaurus 's relative brain size was still within the range of modern reptiles , being at most 2 standard deviations above the mean of non @-@ avian reptile EQs . The estimates for the ratio of cerebrum mass to brain mass would range from 47 @.@ 5 to 49 @.@ 53 percent . According to the study , this is more than the lowest estimates for extant birds ( 44 @.@ 6 percent ) , but still close to the typical ratios of the smallest sexually mature alligators which range from 45 @.@ 9 – 47 @.@ 9 percent . 
 = = = Feeding strategies = = = 
 A 2012 study by scientists Karl Bates and Peter <unk> suggested that the bite force of Tyrannosaurus could have been the strongest of any terrestrial animal that has ever lived . The calculations suggested that adult T. rex could have generated from 35 @,@ 000 to 57 @,@ 000 Newtons of force in the back teeth . However , even higher estimates were made by professor Mason B. Meers of the University of Tampa in 2003 . In his study , Meers estimated a possible bite force of around 183 @,@ 000 to 235 @,@ 000 Newtons or 18 @.@ 3 to 23 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 20 @.@ 2 to 25 @.@ 9 short tons ) . Research done by Stephan <unk> et al. of the University of Bristol , also reveals Tyrannosaurus was also capable of a maximum jaw gape of around 63 @.@ 5 degrees , a necessary adaptation for a wide range of jaw angles in order to power the creature 's strong bite . 
 The debate about whether Tyrannosaurus was a predator or a pure scavenger is as old as the debate about its locomotion . Lambe ( 1917 ) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger , because the Gorgosaurus teeth showed hardly any wear . This argument is no longer taken seriously , because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly . Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have speculated that it was a predator ; like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator 's kill if it had the opportunity . 
 Paleontologist Jack Horner has been a major advocate of the idea that Tyrannosaurus was exclusively a scavenger and did not engage in active hunting at all , though Horner himself has claimed that he never published this idea in the peer @-@ reviewed scientific literature and used it mainly as a tool to teach a popular audience , particularly children , the dangers of making assumptions in science ( such as assuming T. rex was a hunter ) without using evidence . Nevertheless , Horner presented several arguments in the popular literature to support the pure scavenger hypothesis : 
 Tyrannosaur arms are short when compared to other known predators . Horner argues that the arms were too short to make the necessary gripping force to hold on to prey . 
 <unk> had large olfactory bulbs and olfactory nerves ( relative to their brain size ) . These suggest a highly developed sense of smell which could sniff out carcasses over great distances , as modern vultures do . Research on the olfactory bulbs of dinosaurs has shown that Tyrannosaurus had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled dinosaurs . Opponents of the pure scavenger hypothesis have used the example of vultures in the opposite way , arguing that the scavenger hypothesis is implausible because the only modern pure scavengers are large gliding birds , which use their keen senses and energy @-@ efficient gliding to cover vast areas economically . However , researchers from Glasgow concluded that an ecosystem as productive as the current Serengeti would provide sufficient carrion for a large theropod scavenger , although the theropod might have had to be cold @-@ blooded in order to get more calories from carrion than it spent on foraging ( see Metabolism of dinosaurs ) . They also suggested that modern ecosystems like the Serengeti have no large terrestrial scavengers because gliding birds now do the job much more efficiently , while large theropods did not face competition for the scavenger ecological niche from gliding birds . 
 Tyrannosaur teeth could crush bone , and therefore could extract as much food ( bone marrow ) as possible from carcass remnants , usually the least nutritious parts . Karen Chin and colleagues have found bone fragments in coprolites ( fossilized feces ) that they attribute to tyrannosaurs , but point out that a tyrannosaur 's teeth were not well adapted to systematically chewing bone like hyenas do to extract marrow . 
 Since at least some of Tyrannosaurus 's potential prey could move quickly , evidence that it walked instead of ran could indicate that it was a scavenger . On the other hand , recent analyses suggest that Tyrannosaurus , while slower than large modern terrestrial predators , may well have been fast enough to prey on large hadrosaurs and ceratopsians . 
 Other evidence suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus . The eye sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned so that the eyes would point forward , giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks . Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision . It is not obvious why natural selection would have favored this long @-@ term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers , which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides . In modern animals , binocular vision is found mainly in predators . 
 A skeleton of the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus annectens has been described from Montana with healed tyrannosaur @-@ inflicted damage on its tail vertebrae . The fact that the damage seems to have healed suggests that the Edmontosaurus survived a tyrannosaur 's attack on a living target , i.e. the tyrannosaur had attempted active predation . There is also evidence for an aggressive interaction between a Triceratops and a Tyrannosaurus in the form of partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal ( a bone of the neck frill ) ; the bitten horn is also broken , with new bone growth after the break . It is not known what the exact nature of the interaction was , though : either animal could have been the aggressor . Since the Triceratops wounds healed , it is most likely that the Triceratops survived the encounter and managed to overcome the Tyrannosaurus . Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that in a battle against a bull Triceratops , the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the Tyrannosaurus using its sharp horns . 
 When examining Sue , paleontologist Pete Larson found a broken and healed fibula and tail vertebrae , scarred facial bones and a tooth from another Tyrannosaurus embedded in a neck vertebra . If correct , these might be strong evidence for aggressive behavior between tyrannosaurs but whether it would have been competition for food and mates or active cannibalism is unclear . However , further recent investigation of these purported wounds has shown that most are infections rather than injuries ( or simply damage to the fossil after death ) and the few injuries are too general to be indicative of intraspecific conflict . Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger , another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the <unk> Upper Cretaceous . Top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods . The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics that only small dromaeosaurs and troodontids remain as feasible top predators . In this light , scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators , although they may have had a hard time finding enough meat to scavenge , being outnumbered by smaller theropods . Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger like most large carnivores . 
 Tyrannosaurus may have had infectious saliva used to kill its prey . This theory was first proposed by William Abler . Abler examined the teeth of tyrannosaurids between each tooth serration ; the serrations may have held pieces of carcass with bacteria , giving Tyrannosaurus a deadly , infectious bite much like the Komodo dragon was thought to have . However , Jack Horner regards Tyrannosaurus tooth serrations as more like cubes in shape than the serrations on a Komodo monitor 's teeth , which are rounded . All forms of saliva contain possibly hazardous bacteria , so the prospect of it being used as a method of predation is disputable . 
 Tyrannosaurus , and most other theropods , probably primarily processed carcasses with lateral shakes of the head , like crocodilians . The head was not as maneuverable as the skulls of allosauroids , due to flat joints of the neck vertebrae . 
 = = = = Cannibalism = = = = 
 A study from Currie , Horner , Erickson and Longrich in 2010 has been put forward as evidence of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus . They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones , attributable to the same genus . The tooth marks were identified in the humerus , foot bones and metatarsals , and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging , rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat . In a fight , they proposed it would be difficult to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival , making it more likely that the bite marks were made in a carcass . As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh , it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed . They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism . Other evidence for cannibalism has been unearthed . 
 = = = = Pack behavior = = = = 
 Philip J. Currie of the University of Alberta has suggested that Tyrannosaurus may have been pack animals . Currie compared Tyrannosaurus rex favorably to related species Tarbosaurus bataar and Albertosaurus sarcophagus , fossil evidence from which Currie had previously used to suggest that they lived in packs . Currie pointed out that a find in South Dakota preserved three Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons in close proximity to each other . After using CT scanning , Currie stated that Tyrannosaurus would have been capable of such complex behavior , because its brain size is three times greater than what would be expected for an animal of its size . Currie elaborated that Tyrannosaurus had a larger brain @-@ to @-@ body @-@ size proportion than crocodiles and three times more than plant eating dinosaurs such as Triceratops of the same size . Currie believed Tyrannosaurus to be six times smarter than most dinosaurs and other <unk> because the available prey , such as Triceratops and Ankylosaurus , were well @-@ armored , and that others were fast @-@ moving , it would have been necessary for Tyrannosaurus to hunt in groups . Currie speculated that juveniles and adults would have hunted together , with the faster juveniles chasing down the prey and the more powerful adults making the kill , by analogy to modern @-@ day pack hunters where each member contributes a skill . 
 However , Currie 's pack @-@ hunting hypothesis has been harshly criticized by other scientists . Brian Switek , writing for The Guardian in 2011 , noted that Currie 's pack hypothesis has not been presented as research in a peer @-@ reviewed scientific journal , but primarily in relation to a television special and tie @-@ in book called Dino Gangs . Switek also noted that Currie 's argument for pack hunting in Tyrannosaurus rex is primarily based on analogy to a different species , Tarbosaurus bataar , and that the supposed evidence for pack hunting in T. bataar itself has not yet been published and subjected to scientific scrutiny . According to Switek and other scientists who have participated in panel discussions about the Dino Gangs television program , the evidence for pack hunting in Tarbosaurus and Albertosaurus is weak , based primarily on the association of several skeletons , for which numerous alternative explanations have been proposed ( e.g. drought or floods forcing numerous specimens together to die in one place ) . In fact , Switek notes that the Albertosaurus bonebed site , on which Currie has based most of the interpretations of supposed pack hunting in related species , preserves geological evidence of just such a flood . Switek said , " bones alone are not enough to reconstruct dinosaur behaviour . The geological context in which those bones are found – the intricate details of ancient environments and the pace of prehistoric time – are essential to investigating the lives and deaths of dinosaurs , " and noted that Currie must first describe the geological evidence from other tyrannosaur bonebed sites before jumping to conclusions about social behavior . Switek described the sensational claims provided in press releases and news stories surrounding the Dino Gangs program as " nauseating hype " and noted that the production company responsible for the program , Atlantic Productions , has a poor record involving exaggerating claims about new fossil discoveries , most notably the controversial claim it published regarding the supposed early human ancestor Darwinius , which soon turned out to be a relative of lemurs instead . 
 Lawrence Witmer pointed out that social behavior can 't be determined by brain endocasts and the brains of solitary leopards are identical to those of a cooperatively hunting lion ; estimated brain sizes only show that an animal may have hunted in groups . In his opinion , the brains of tyrannosaurs were large enough for what he dubs " communal hunting " , a semi @-@ organized behavior that falls between solitary and cooperative hunting . Witmer claims that communal hunting is a step towards the evolution of cooperative hunting . He found it hard to believe that tyrannosaurs wouldn 't have exploited the opportunity to join others in making a kill , and thus decrease risk and increase their chances of success . 
 On July 23 , 2014 , evidence , for the first time , in the form of fossilized trackways in Canada , showed that tyrannosaurs may have hunted in groups . 
 = = = Pathology = = = 
 In 2001 , Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior . Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries . Of the 81 Tyrannosaurus foot bones examined in the study one was found to have a stress fracture , while none of the 10 hand bones were found to have stress fractures . The researchers found tendon avulsions only among Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus . An avulsion injury left a divot on the humerus of Sue the T. rex , apparently located at the origin of the deltoid or teres major muscles . The presence of avulsion injuries being limited to the forelimb and shoulder in both Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus suggests that theropods may have had a musculature more complex than and functionally different from those of birds . The researchers concluded that Sue 's tendon avulsion was probably obtained from struggling prey . The presence of stress fractures and tendon avulsions in general provides evidence for a " very active " predation @-@ based diet rather than obligate scavenging . 
 A 2009 study showed that holes in the skulls of several specimens that were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might have been caused by Trichomonas @-@ like parasites that commonly infect avians . Further evidence of intraspecific attack would however be found by Joseph Peterson and his colleagues in the juvenile Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane . Peterson and his team found that Jane 's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus . Subsequent CT scans of Jane 's skull would further confirm the team 's hypothesis , showing that the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing . The team would also state that Jane 's injuries were structurally different from the parasite @-@ induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane 's injuries were on her face whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw .

 Tyrannosaurus lived during what is referred to as the Lancian faunal stage ( Maastrichtian age ) at the end of the Late Cretaceous . Tyrannosaurus ranged from Canada in the north to at least Texas and New Mexico in the south of Laramidia . During this time Triceratops was the major herbivore in the northern portion of its range , while the titanosaurian sauropod Alamosaurus " dominated " its southern range . Tyrannosaurus remains have been discovered in different ecosystems , including inland and coastal subtropical , and semi @-@ arid plains . 
 Several notable Tyrannosaurus remains have been found in the Hell Creek Formation . During the Maastrichtian this area was subtropical , with a warm and humid climate . The flora consisted mostly of angiosperms , but also included trees like dawn redwood ( Metasequoia ) and Araucaria . Tyrannosaurus shared this ecosystem with Triceratops , related ceratopsians Nedoceratops , Tatankaceratops and Torosaurus , the <unk> Edmontosaurus annectens and possibly a species of Parasaurolophus , the armored dinosaurs Denversaurus , Edmontonia , Ankylosaurus , the dome headed dinosaurs Pachycephalosaurus , Stygimoloch , Sphaerotholus , and Dracorex , hypsilophodont Thescelosaurus , and the theropods Ornithomimus , Struthiomimus , <unk> , Acheroraptor , Dakotaraptor , Richardoestesia , Paronychodon , Pectinodon and Troodon . 
 Another formation with tyrannosaur remains is the Lance Formation of Wyoming . This has been interpreted as a bayou environment similar to today 's Gulf Coast . The fauna was very similar to Hell Creek , but with Struthiomimus replacing its relative Ornithomimus . The small ceratopsian Leptoceratops also lived in the area . 
 In its southern range Tyrannosaurus lived alongside the titanosaur Alamosaurus , the ceratopsians Torosaurus , <unk> and Ojoceratops , hadrosaurs which consisted of a species of Edmontosaurus , Kritosaurus and a possible species of Gryposaurus , the nodosaur Glyptodontopelta , the oviraptorid <unk> , possible species of the theropods Troodon and Richardoestesia , and the pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus . The region is thought to have been dominated by semi @-@ arid inland plains , following the probable retreat of the Western Interior Seaway as global sea levels fell . 
 = = History = = 
 Henry Fairfield Osborn , president of the American Museum of Natural History , named Tyrannosaurus rex in 1905 . The generic name is derived from the Greek words <unk> ( tyrannos , meaning " tyrant " ) and <unk> ( sauros , meaning " lizard " ) . Osborn used the Latin word rex , meaning " king " , for the specific name . The full binomial therefore translates to " tyrant lizard the king " or " King Tyrant Lizard " , emphasizing the animal 's size and perceived dominance over other species of the time . 
 = = = Earliest finds = = = 
 Teeth from what is now documented as a Tyrannosaurus rex were found in 1874 by Arthur Lakes near Golden , Colorado . In the early 1890s , John Bell Hatcher collected postcranial elements in eastern Wyoming . The fossils were believed to be from a large species of Ornithomimus ( O. grandis ) but are now considered Tyrannosaurus rex remains . Vertebral fragments found by Edward Drinker Cope in western South Dakota in 1892 and assigned to Manospondylus gigas have also been recognized as belonging to Tyrannosaurus rex . 
 Barnum Brown , assistant curator of the American Museum of Natural History , found the first partial skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex in eastern Wyoming in 1900 . H. F. Osborn originally named this skeleton Dynamosaurus imperiosus in a paper in 1905 . Brown found another partial skeleton in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana in 1902 . Osborn used this holotype to describe Tyrannosaurus rex in the same paper in which D. imperiosus was described . In 1906 , Osborn recognized the two as synonyms , and acted as first <unk> by selecting Tyrannosaurus as the valid name . The original Dynamosaurus material resides in the collections of the Natural History Museum , London . 
 In total , Brown found five Tyrannosaurus partial skeletons . In 1941 , Brown 's 1902 find was sold to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . Brown 's fourth and largest find , also from Hell Creek , is on display in the American Museum of Natural History in New York . 
 = = = Manospondylus = = = 
 The first named fossil specimen which can be attributed to Tyrannosaurus rex consists of two partial vertebrae ( one of which has been lost ) found by Edward Drinker Cope in 1892 . Cope believed that they belonged to an " <unk> " ( ceratopsid ) dinosaur , and named them Manospondylus gigas , meaning " giant porous vertebra " in reference to the numerous openings for blood vessels he found in the bone . The M. gigas remains were later identified as those of a theropod rather than a ceratopsid , and H.F. Osborn recognized the similarity between M. gigas and Tyrannosaurus rex as early as 1917 . However , owing to the fragmentary nature of the Manospondylus vertebrae , Osborn did not <unk> the two genera . 
 In June 2000 , the Black Hills Institute located the type locality of M. gigas in South Dakota and unearthed more tyrannosaur bones there . These were judged to represent further remains of the same individual , and to be identical to those of Tyrannosaurus rex . According to the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) , the system that governs the scientific naming of animals , Manospondylus gigas should therefore have priority over Tyrannosaurus rex , because it was named first . However , the Fourth Edition of the ICZN , which took effect on January 1 , 2000 , states that " the prevailing usage must be maintained " when " the senior synonym or homonym has not been used as a valid name after 1899 " and " the junior synonym or homonym has been used for a particular taxon , as its presumed valid name , in at least 25 works , published by at least 10 authors in the immediately preceding 50 years ... " Tyrannosaurus rex may qualify as the valid name under these conditions and would most likely be considered a nomen <unk> ( " protected name " ) under the ICZN if it is ever formally published on , which it has not yet been . Manospondylus gigas could then be deemed a nomen oblitum ( " forgotten name " ) .

 Sue Hendrickson , amateur paleontologist , discovered the most complete ( approximately 85 % ) and the largest Tyrannosaurus fossil skeleton known in the Hell Creek Formation near Faith , South Dakota , on August 12 , 1990 . This Tyrannosaurus , nicknamed Sue in her honor , was the object of a legal battle over its ownership . In 1997 this was settled in favor of Maurice Williams , the original land owner . The fossil collection was purchased by the Field Museum of Natural History at auction for $ 7 @.@ 6 million , making it the most expensive dinosaur skeleton to date . From 1998 to 1999 Field Museum of Natural History <unk> spent over 25 @,@ 000 man @-@ hours taking the rock off each of the bones . The bones were then shipped off to New Jersey where the mount was made . The finished mount was then taken apart , and along with the bones , shipped back to Chicago for the final assembly . The mounted skeleton opened to the public on May 17 , 2000 in the great hall ( Stanley Field Hall ) at the Field Museum of Natural History . A study of this specimen 's fossilized bones showed that Sue reached full size at age 19 and died at age 28 , the longest any tyrannosaur is known to have lived . Early speculation that Sue may have died from a bite to the back of the head was not confirmed . Though subsequent study showed many pathologies in the skeleton , no bite marks were found . Damage to the back of the skull may have been caused by post @-@ mortem trampling . Recent speculation indicates that Sue may have died of starvation after contracting a parasitic infection from eating diseased meat ; the resulting infection would have caused inflammation in the throat , ultimately leading Sue to starve because she could no longer swallow food . This hypothesis is substantiated by smooth @-@ edged holes in her skull which are similar to those caused in modern @-@ day birds that contract the same parasite . 
 Another Tyrannosaurus , nicknamed Stan , in honor of amateur paleontologist Stan <unk> , was found in the Hell Creek Formation near Buffalo , South Dakota , in the spring of 1987 . It was not collected until 1992 , as it was mistakenly thought to be a Triceratops skeleton . Stan is 63 % complete and is on display in the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City , South Dakota , after an extensive world tour during 1995 and 1996 . This tyrannosaur , too , was found to have many bone pathologies , including broken and healed ribs , a broken ( and healed ) neck and a spectacular hole in the back of its head , about the size of a Tyrannosaurus tooth . 
 In the summer of 2000 , Jack Horner discovered five Tyrannosaurus skeletons near the Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana . One of the specimens was reported to be perhaps the largest Tyrannosaurus ever found . 
 In 2001 , a 50 % complete skeleton of a juvenile Tyrannosaurus was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana , by a crew from the Burpee Museum of Natural History of Rockford , Illinois . Dubbed Jane , the find was initially considered the first known skeleton of the pygmy tyrannosaurid Nanotyrannus but subsequent research has revealed that it is more likely a juvenile Tyrannosaurus . It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date . Jane has been examined by Jack Horner , Pete Larson , Robert Bakker , Greg Erickson , and several other renowned paleontologists , because of the uniqueness of her age . Jane is currently on exhibit at the Burpee Museum of Natural History in Rockford , Illinois . 
 In a press release on April 7 , 2006 , Bozeman Campus , Montana State University , USA revealed that it possessed the largest Tyrannosaurus skull yet discovered . Discovered in the 1960s and only recently reconstructed , the skull measures 59 inches ( 150 cm ) long compared to the 55 @.@ 4 inches ( 141 cm ) of Sue 's skull , a difference of 6 @.@ 5 % . However , it has been incorrectly reconstructed , and has been corrected to 134 cm ( 53 in ) .

 Since it was first described in 1905 , Tyrannosaurus rex has become the most widely recognized dinosaur species in popular culture . It is the only dinosaur that is commonly known to the general public by its full scientific name ( binomial name ) ( Tyrannosaurus rex ) , and the scientific abbreviation T. rex has also come into wide usage . Robert T. Bakker notes this in The Dinosaur Heresies and explains that a name like " Tyrannosaurus rex is just irresistible to the tongue . " 
 = Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone = 
 Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone is the first novel in the Harry Potter series and J. K. Rowling 's debut novel , first published in 1997 by Bloomsbury . It was published in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone by Scholastic Corporation in 1998 . The plot follows Harry Potter , a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage as he makes close friends and a few enemies in his first year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . With the help of his friends , Harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort , who killed Harry 's parents , but failed to kill Harry when he was just a year old . 
 The novel won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US . The book reached the top of the New York Times list of best @-@ selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000 . It has been translated into at least sixty @-@ seven other languages and has been made into a feature @-@ length film of the same name , as have all six of its sequels . 
 Most reviews were very favourable , commenting on Rowling 's imagination , humour , simple , direct style and clever plot construction , although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed . The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen , one of Rowling 's favourite authors , or Roald Dahl , whose works dominated children 's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter , and of the Ancient Greek story @-@ teller Homer . While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories , others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues . 
 Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , along with the rest of the Harry Potter series , has been attacked by several religious groups and banned in some countries because of accusations that the novels promote witchcraft , but other religious commentators have written that the book exemplifies important viewpoints , including the power of self @-@ sacrifice and the ways in which people 's decisions shape their personalities . The series has been used as a source of object lessons in educational techniques , sociological analysis and marketing .

 = = = Plot = = = 
 The most evil and powerful dark wizard in history , Lord Voldemort , murdered married couple James and Lily Potter but mysteriously disappeared after failing to kill their infant son , Harry . While the wizarding world celebrates Voldemort 's apparent downfall , Professor Dumbledore , Professor McGonagall and half @-@ giant Rubeus Hagrid place the one @-@ year @-@ old orphan in the care of his surly and cold Muggle uncle and aunt , Vernon and Petunia Dursley , with their spoiled and bullying son , Dudley . 
 Ten years later while living at number Four Privet Drive , Harry is tormented by the Dursleys , treated more like a servant than a member of the family and forced to live in a cupboard under the stairs . Shortly before his eleventh birthday , a series of letters addressed to Harry arrive , but Vernon destroys them before Harry can read them , leading only to an influx of more letters . To evade the pursuit of the letters , Vernon first takes the family to a hotel , and , when the letters arrive there too , he hires a boat out to a small island . On Harry 's eleventh birthday at midnight , Hagrid bursts through the door to deliver Harry 's letter and tells him what the Dursleys have kept from him : Harry is a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . Hagrid takes Harry to a hidden London street called Diagon Alley , where he is startled to discover how famous he is among the witches and wizards , who refer to him as " the boy who lived . " He also finds that his parents ' inheritance is waiting for him at Gringotts Wizarding Bank . Guided by Hagrid , he buys the equipment he will need for his first year at Hogwarts and receives a pet owl . 
 A month later , Harry leaves the Dursleys ' home to catch the Hogwarts Express from King 's Cross railway station . There he meets the Weasley family , who show him how to pass through the magic wall to Platform 9 ¾ , where the train that will take them to Hogwarts is waiting . While on the train , Harry meets two fellow first years , Ron Weasley , who immediately becomes his friend , and Hermione Granger , with whom the ice is a bit slower to break . Harry also makes an enemy of yet another first @-@ year , Draco Malfoy . Draco offers to advise Harry , but Harry dislikes Draco for his arrogance and prejudice and rejects his offer of " friendship " . 
 At Hogwarts , the first @-@ years are assigned by the magical Sorting Hat to houses that best suites their personality . While Harry is being sorted , the Hat suggests that he be placed into Slytherin which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards , but when Harry objects , the Hat sends him to Gryffindor . Ron and Hermione are also sorted into Gryffindor . Draco is sorted into Slytherin , like his whole family before him . 
 Harry starts classes at Hogwarts School , with lessons including Transfiguration with Head of Gryffindor , Minerva McGonagall , <unk> with Head of Hufflepuff , Pomona Sprout , Charms with Head of Ravenclaw Filius Flitwick , and Defence Against the Dark Arts with Quirinus Quirrell . Harry 's least favourite class is Potions , taught by Severus Snape , the vindictive Head of Slytherin who seems to loathe Harry . Harry , Ron , and Hermione become far more interested by extracurricular matters within and outside of the school , particularly after they discover that a huge three @-@ headed dog is standing guard over a trapdoor in a condemned corridor . They also become suspicious of Snape 's behaviour and become convinced that he is looking for ways to get past the trapdoor . 
 Harry discovers an innate talent for flying on broomsticks and is appointed as Seeker on his House ’ s Quidditch team , a wizards 's sport played in the air . His first game goes well until his broomstick wobbles in mid @-@ air and almost throws him off . Ron and Hermione suspect foul play from Snape , whom they saw behaving oddly . For Christmas , Harry receives an invisibility cloak from an anonymous source and begins exploring the school at night and investigating the hidden object further . He discovers the Mirror of Erised , in which the viewer 's sees his deepest desires becoming true . 
 Thanks to an indiscretion from Hagrid , Harry and his friends work out that the object kept at the school is a Philosopher 's Stone , made by an old friend of Dumbledore named Nicolas Flamel . Harry is also informed by a centaur he meets in the forest that a plot to steal the Philosopher ’ s stone is being orchestrated by none other than Voldemort himself , who would use it to be restored to his body and come back to power . When Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences , Harry and his friends fear that the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor themselves . 
 They encounter a series of obstacles , each of which requires unique skills possessed by one of the three , and one of which requires Ron to sacrifice himself in a life @-@ sized game of wizard 's chess . In the final room , Harry , now alone , finds Quirrell , who admits that he had tried to kill Harry at his Quidditch match against Slytherin . He also admits that he let the troll into Hogwarts . Snape had been trying to protect Harry all along rather than to kill him , and his suspicious behaviour came from his own suspicions about Quirrell . 
 Quirrell is one of Voldemort 's followers , and is now partly possessed by him : Voldemort 's face has sprouted on the back of his own head , hidden by his turban . Voldemort needs Harry 's help to get past the final obstacle : the Mirror of Erised , but when Quirrell tries to grab the Stone from Harry his contact proves lethal for Quirrell . Harry passes out and awakes in the school hospital , where Dumbledore explains to him that he survived because his mother sacrificed her life to protect him , and this left a powerful protective charm on him . Voldemort left Quirrell to die and is likely to return by some other means . The Stone has now been destroyed . The school year ends at the final feast , during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup . Harry returns to the Dursleys ' for the summer holiday but does not tell them that under @-@ age wizards are forbidden to use magic outside of Hogwarts . 
 = = = Main characters = = = 
 Harry Potter is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a " scrawny , black @-@ haired , bespectacled boy who didn 't know he was a wizard . " She developed the series ' story and characters to explain how Harry came to be in this situation and how his life unfolded from there . Apart from the first chapter , the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry 's eleventh birthday . Voldemort 's attack left a lightning bolt @-@ shaped scar on Harry 's forehead , which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present . Harry has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person to get on a team in their first year . 
 Ron Weasley is Harry 's age and Rowling describes him as the ultimate best friend , " always there when you need him . " He is freckled , red @-@ haired and quite tall . He grew up in a fairly large pure @-@ blood family as the sixth born of seven children . Although his family is quite poor , they still live comfortably and happily . His loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizards Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher 's Stone . 
 Hermione Granger , the daughter of an all @-@ Muggle family , is a bossy girl who has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of term . Rowling described Hermione as a " very logical , upright and good " character with " a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her <unk> " . Despite her nagging efforts to keep Harry and Ron out of trouble , she becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save her from a troll , and her magical and analytical skills play an important role in finding the Philosopher 's Stone . She has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth . 
 Neville Longbottom is a plump , diffident boy , so forgetful that his grandmother gives him a <unk> , although he cannot remember why . Neville 's magical abilities are weak and appeared just in time to save his life when he was eight . Despite his timidity , Neville will fight anyone after some encouragement or if he thinks it is right and important . 
 Rubeus Hagrid , a half @-@ giant nearly 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) tall , with tangled black hair and beard , was expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was broken , but Professor Dumbledore let him stay on as the school 's gamekeeper , a job which enables him to lavish affection and pet names on even the most dangerous of magical creatures . Hagrid is fiercely loyal to Dumbledore and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry , Ron and , later , Hermione , but his carelessness makes him unreliable . 
 Professor Dumbledore , a tall , thin man who wears half @-@ moon spectacles and has silver hair and a beard that tucks into his belt , is the headmaster of Hogwarts , and thought to be the only wizard Voldemort fears . Dumbledore , while renowned for his achievements in magic , finds it difficult to resist sweets and has a whimsical sense of humour . Although he shrugs off praise , he is aware of his own brilliance . Rowling described him as the " epitome of goodness " . 
 Professor McGonagall , a tall , severe @-@ looking woman with black hair tied in a tight bun , teaches Transfiguration , and sometimes transforms herself into a cat . She is Deputy Headmistress , and Head of Gryffindor House and , according to the author , " under that gruff exterior " is " a bit of an old <unk> " . 
 Petunia Dursley , the sister of Harry 's mother Lily , is a thin woman with a long neck that she uses for spying on the neighbours . She regards her magical sister as a freak and tries to pretend that she never existed . Her husband Vernon is a heavily built man whose irascible bluster covers a narrow mind and a fear of anything unusual . Their son Dudley is an overweight , spoiled bully . 
 Draco Malfoy is a slim , pale boy who speaks in a bored drawl . He is arrogant about his skill in Quidditch , and despises anyone who is not a pure @-@ blood wizard – and wizards who do not share his views . His parents had supported Voldemort , but changed sides after the dark wizard 's disappearance , claiming they had been bewitched . Draco avoids direct confrontations , and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble . 
 Professor Quirrell is a twitching , stammering man who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts . Reputedly he was a brilliant scholar , but his nerve was shattered by an encounter with vampires . Quirrell wears a turban to conceal the fact that he is voluntarily possessed by Voldemort , whose face appears on the back of Quirrell 's head . 
 Professor Snape , who has a hooked nose , sallow complexion and greasy black hair , teaches Potions , but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts . Snape praises pupils in Slytherin , his own House but seizes every opportunity to humiliate others , especially Harry . Several incidents , beginning with the shooting pain in Harry 's scar during the start @-@ of @-@ term feast , lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is a follower of Voldemort . 
 Filch , the school caretaker who knows the school 's secret passages better than anyone else except , possibly , the Weasley twins . His cat , Mrs. Norris , aids his constant hunt for misbehaving pupils . 
 Other members of staff include the dumpy <unk> teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout , Professor Flitwick , the tiny and excitable Charms teacher , and Head of Ravenclaw House , the soporific History of Magic teacher , Professor Binns , a ghost who does not seem to have noticed his own death ; and Madam Hooch , the Quidditch coach , who is strict , but a considerate and methodical teacher . The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever he can . 
 In the book , Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters . The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley , Harry 's uncle . Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero Harry Potter , an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family . Rowling imagined him as a " scrawny , black @-@ haired , bespectacled boy who didn 't know he was a wizard " , and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him . During the book , Harry makes two close friends , Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger . Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend , " always there when you need him " . Rowling has described Hermione as a " very logical , upright and good " character with " a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her <unk> " . 
 Rowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults . The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful , but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore , who becomes Harry 's confidant ; Rowling described him as " epitome of goodness " . His right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall , who according to the author " under that gruff exterior " is " a bit of an old <unk> " , the friendly half @-@ giant Rubeus Hagrid , who saved Harry from the Dursley family and the sinister Severus Snape . Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel . 
 The main antagonists are Draco Malfoy , an elitist , bullying classmate and Lord Voldemort , the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when he tries to kill baby Harry . According to a 1999 interview with Rowling , the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry , and his backstory was intentionally not fleshed @-@ out at first : 
 The basic idea ... Harry , I saw Harry very very very clearly . Very vividly . And I knew he didn 't know he was a wizard . [ ... ] And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be , that he wouldn 't know what he was . [ ... ] When he was one year old , the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him . He killed Harry 's parents , and then he tried to kill Harry — he tried to curse him . [ ... ] And — so — but for some mysterious reason , the curse didn 't work on Harry . So he 's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard , who has been in hiding ever since .

 The book , which was Rowling 's debut novel , was written between approximately June 1990 and some time in 1995 . In 1990 Jo Rowling , as she preferred to be known , wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words , " One weekend after flat hunting , I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head ... A scrawny , little , black @-@ haired , bespectacled boy became more and more of a wizard to me ... I began to write Philosopher 's Stone that very evening . Although , the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product . " Then Rowling 's mother died and , to cope with her pain , Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry . Rowling spent six years working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury , she obtained a grant of £ 8 @,@ 000 from the Scottish Arts Council , which enabled her to plan the sequels . She sent the book to an agent and a publisher , and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers , most of whom thought it was too long at about 90 @,@ 000 words . Barry Cunningham , who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children 's Books , recommended accepting the book , and the eight @-@ year @-@ old daughter of Bloomsbury 's chief executive said it was " so much better than anything else " . 
 = = = Publication and reception in the United Kingdom = = = 
 Bloomsbury accepted the book , paying Rowling a £ 2 @,@ 500 advance , and Cunningham sent proof copies to carefully chosen authors , critics and booksellers in order to obtain comments that could be quoted when the book was launched . He was less concerned about the book 's length than about its author 's name , since the title sounded like a boys ' book to him , and he believed boys preferred books by male authors . Rowling therefore adopted the nom de plume J.K. Rowling just before publication . In June 1997 , Bloomsbury published Philosopher 's Stone with an initial print @-@ run of 500 copies in hardback , three hundred of which were distributed to libraries . Her original name , " Joanne Rowling " , can be found in small print on the copyright page of this first British edition . ( The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to " Joanne " completely . ) The short initial print run was standard for first novels , and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers . Examples from this initial print run have become quite valuable , selling for as much as US $ 33 @,@ 460 in a 2007 Heritage Auction . 
 Lindsey Fraser , who had supplied one of the blurb comments , wrote what is thought to be the first published review , in The Scotsman on 28 June 1997 . She described Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone as " a hugely entertaining thriller " and Rowling as " a first @-@ rate writer for children " . Another early review , in The Herald , said , " I have yet to find a child who can put it down . " Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book , with glowing reviews in The Guardian , The Sunday Times and The Mail on Sunday , and in September 1997 Books for Keeps , a magazine that specialised in children 's books , gave the novel four stars out of five . The Mail on Sunday rated it as " the most imaginative debut since Roald Dahl " ; a view echoed by the Sunday Times ( " comparisons to Dahl are , this time , justified " ) , while The Guardian called it " a richly textured novel given lift @-@ off by an inventive wit " and The Scotsman said it had " all the makings of a classic " . 
 In 1997 the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9 to 11 year @-@ olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize . The Smarties award , which is voted for by children , made the book well @-@ known within six months of publication , while most children 's books have to wait for years . The following year , Philosopher 's Stone won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children . It was also shortlisted for children 's books awards adjudicated by adults , but did not win . Sandra Beckett comments that books which were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards – for example the literary establishment disdained the works of Roald Dahl , an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling 's books . In 2003 , the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC 's survey The Big Read . 
 Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit , the British Book Awards Children 's Book of the Year and the Booksellers ' Association / Bookseller Author of the Year . By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300 @,@ 000 copies , and the story was still the UK 's best @-@ selling title in December 2001 . A Braille edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish Braille Press .

 Scholastic Corporation bought the U.S. rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US $ 105 @,@ 000 , an unusually high sum for a children 's book . They thought that a child would not want to read a book with the word " philosopher " in the title and , after some discussion , the American edition was published in September 1998 under the title Rowling suggested , Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone . Rowling claimed that she regretted this change and would have fought it if she had been in a stronger position at the time . Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy , and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation , for example from UK English " crumpets " to US English " muffin " . While Rowling accepted the change from both UK English " mum " and Seamus Finnigan 's Irish variant " mam " to " mom " in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone , she vetoed this change in the later books ( this change was reversed in later editions of the book ) . However Nel considered that Scholastic 's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on UK English books of the time , and that some other changes could be regarded as useful <unk> . Since the UK editions of early titles in the series were published a few months earlier than the American versions , some American readers became familiar with the British English versions after buying them via the Internet . 
 At first the most prestigious reviewers ignored the book , leaving it to book trade and library publications such as Kirkus Reviews and Booklist , which examined it only by the entertainment @-@ oriented criteria of children 's fiction . However , more penetrating specialist reviews ( such as one by Cooperative Children 's Book Center Choices , which pointed out the complexity , depth and consistency of the world Rowling had built ) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers . Although The Boston Globe and Michael <unk> in The New York Times complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book , they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise . A year later the US edition was selected as an American Library Association Notable Book , a Publishers Weekly Best Book of 1998 , and a New York Public Library 1998 Best Book of the Year , and won Parenting Magazine 's Book of the Year Award for 1998 , the School Library Journal Best Book of the Year , and the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults . 
 In August 1999 Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone topped the New York Times list of best @-@ selling fiction , and stayed near the top of the list for much of 1999 and 2000 , until the New York Times split its list into children 's and adult sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings . Publishers Weekly 's report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children 's fiction placed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone 19th among <unk> ( over 5 million copies ) and 7th among paperbacks ( over 6 @.@ 6 million copies ) . 
 In May 2008 , Scholastic announced the creation of a 10th Anniversary Edition of the book that was released on 1 October 2008 to mark the tenth anniversary of the original American release . For the fifteenth anniversary of the books , Scholastic re @-@ released Sorcerer 's Stone , along with the other six novels in the series , with new cover art by Kazu Kibuishi in 2013 .

 Philip Nel highlighted the influence of Jane Austen , whom Rowling has greatly admired since the age of twelve . Both novelists encourage re @-@ reading , because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story @-@ line – for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books . Like Austen 's heroines , Harry often has to re @-@ examine his ideas near the ends of books . Some social behaviour in the Harry Potter books is <unk> of Austen , for example the excited communal reading of letters . Both authors satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities . However in Nel 's opinion Rowling 's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens 's stories , and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners ' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth @-@ century German literature . Rowling , like the Narnia series ' author C.S. Lewis , thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults . Nel also noted that , like many good writers for children , Rowling combines literary genres ‍ — ‌ fantasy , young @-@ adult fiction , boarding school stories , Bildungsroman and many others . 
 Some reviewers compared Philosopher 's Stone to the stories of Roald Dahl , who died in 1990 . Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor , but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and , in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of Philosopher 's Stone , seven of the ten most popular children 's books were by Dahl , including the one in top place . The only other really popular children 's author of the late 1990s was an American , R. L. Stine . Some of the story elements in Philosopher 's Stone resembled parts of Dahl 's stories ; for example , the hero of James and the Giant Peach lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts ‍ — ‌ one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley , who treated Harry as a servant . However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation , able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside . 
 Librarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions , especially of shop scenes such as Diagon Alley . Tad Brennan commented that Rowling 's writing resembles that of Homer : " rapid , plain , and direct in expression . " Stephen King admired " the sort of playful details of which only British <unk> seem capable " and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward . 
 Nicholas Tucker described the early Harry Potter books as looking back to Victorian and Edwardian children 's stories : Hogwarts was an old @-@ style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated ; characters ' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances , starting with the Dursleys ; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed , including Filch 's cat Mrs Norris ; and the hero , a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life , was charismatic and good at sports , but considerate and protective towards the weak . Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes . However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain : a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld ; the multi @-@ ethnic composition of Hogwarts ' students ; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species ; and school bullying . 
 Susan Hall wrote that there is no rule of law in the books , as the actions of Ministry of Magic officials are unconstrained by laws , accountability or any kind of legal challenge . This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order . As a side @-@ effect Harry and Hermione , who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world , find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards . For example , Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher 's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power , and that most wizards have no chance of solving it . 
 Nel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely conventional , status @-@ conscious , materialistic Dursleys was Rowling 's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s , which treated the married heterosexual couple as the " preferred norm " , while the author was a single mother . Harry 's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty . This is reflected in his happiness whenever he is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series , and in his treatment of first Rubeus Hagrid and later Remus Lupin and Sirius Black as father @-@ figures .

 Writers on education and business subjects have used the book as an object lesson . Writing about clinical teaching in medical schools , Jennifer Conn contrasted Snape 's technical expertise with his intimidating behaviour towards students ; on the other hand Quidditch coach Madam Hooch illustrated useful techniques in the teaching of physical skills , including breaking down complex actions into sequences of simple ones and helping students to avoid common errors . Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first @-@ year sociology class : " sociological concepts including culture , society , and socialisation ; stratification and social inequality ; social institutions ; and social theory " . 
 Stephen Brown noted that the early Harry Potter books , especially Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , were a runaway success despite inadequate and poorly organised marketing . Brown advised marketing executives to be less preoccupied with rigorous statistical analyses and the " analysis , planning , implementation , and control " model of management .

 = Kenilworth Road = 
 Kenilworth Road is a football stadium in Luton , Bedfordshire , England . It has been home to Luton Town Football Club since 1905 when they left Dunstable Road . The ground has also hosted women 's and youth international matches . 
 The 10 @,@ 356 all @-@ seater stadium is situated in Bury Park , one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) west of the centre of Luton . It is named after the road which runs along one end of it , but the official address is 1 Maple Road . Kenilworth Road hosted football in the Southern League until 1920 , then in the Football League until 2009 , when Luton were relegated to the Conference Premier . It has hosted Football League matches once more since 2014 . 
 The ground is known for the artificial playing surface which was present from 1985 to 1991 , the unusual entrance to the Oak Road End , and the five @-@ season ban on away supporters that Luton Town imposed following a riot by visiting fans in 1985 . Floodlights were fitted in 1953 , and the ground became all @-@ seated in 1986 . The record attendance of 30 @,@ 069 was set in 1959 , in an FA Cup sixth round replay against Blackpool . 
 = = History = = 
 Luton Town moved to Kenilworth Road in 1905 , leaving their previous home at Dunstable Road after their landlord sold the site for housing at short notice . The club 's directors quickly procured a new site , and the club 's first match at the new ground came on 4 September 1905 — a 0 – 0 draw against Plymouth Argyle . Watford player C. Barnes scored the first ever goal at the stadium , in a reserve match . Originally known as Ivy Road , the new ground brought success with it — in their last season at Dunstable Road , Luton had finished second from bottom , but in the first at Kenilworth Road , Luton finished fourth in the Southern League . 
 The ground has undergone several major changes since its original construction in 1905 . The original Main Stand , boasting a press loft and a balcony above the roof , burnt down in 1921 , and was replaced by the current stand before the 1922 – 23 campaign . The new Main Stand was split into two : the upper tier contained wooden seats , so there was a ban on smoking in the stand ; the lower tier , which became known as the Enclosure , was terracing . 
 When attendances were first counted , in 1932 – 33 , Luton Town 's average home attendance was taken at 5 @,@ 868 . Kenilworth Road 's capacity of the time was 25 @,@ 000 , so it was not deemed necessary to improve the ground . However , only three years later , on 25 April 1936 , a match against Coventry City attracted 23 @,@ 142 spectators — at that time a club record . The decision was taken to renovate the stadium , already in disrepair , and work began at the end of the following season . The Kenilworth End terrace was extended , the Oak Road End received a roof and major work was done on the Main Stand . Following these steps , the ground was more in line with those of rival clubs , the capacity standing at 30 @,@ 000 . 
 The first ten years following Kenilworth Road 's renovation saw average attendances of between 15 @,@ 000 and 18 @,@ 000 ; a huge improvement on what the club had previously been able to attract . Floodlights were installed at the ground before the 1953 – 54 season , and used for the first time in a friendly against Turkish side Fenerbahçe on 7 October 1953 . The Oak Road terrace was extended in 1955 , and promotion to the First Division for 1955 – 56 saw the average attendance climb as high as 21 @,@ 454 . 
 Renovation of Kenilworth Road was neglected for the next two decades — financial difficulties and the club 's ambitions to build a new ground meant that regeneration was unaffordable , and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur . However , following the rejection of several potential sites for a new ground , the club finally turned their attentions back to the maintenance of Kenilworth Road . The first real modernisation of the ground came in 1973 , with the first addition of seats at the stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922 . The Bobbers Stand became all @-@ seated , while the rest of the ground remained terracing . The new @-@ look stand could only hold 1 @,@ 539 seats , and as a result the capacity of the ground dropped to 22 @,@ 601 . 
 A £ 1 million <unk> got under way in 1985 with the introduction of artificial turf , as well as the conversion of the ground to all @-@ seater , which began a year later in 1986 . The Oak Road End was filled with seats , while the Bobbers Stand had its seats ripped out to be replaced with executive boxes . The Main Stand 's enclosure received seats , and work also began on converting the Kenilworth Stand , which had a roof added at this time . The stand would also receive seats in stages over the coming years . 
 The David Preece Stand was erected in 1991 , simply called the New Stand on construction . The final improvements to the ground came in 2005 , when the conversion of the Kenilworth Stand was finally completed to bring the capacity to its present 10 @,@ 356 . 
 On 24 March 2015 the ground was officially renamed " The Prostate Cancer UK Stadium " for one day , for the game against Wycombe Wanderers , in support of charity and raising awareness of prostate cancer . 
 = = = Artificial pitch = = = 
 In 1985 , following the lead of Queen Park Rangers ' experiment at Loftus Road four years earlier , the grass pitch was dug up and replaced with an artificial playing surface . The surface , called <unk> Professional , was manufactured by En @-@ Tout @-@ Cas , and cost the club £ 350 @,@ 000 . The first match on the new pitch was a 1 – 1 draw with Nottingham Forest . The new surface became exceedingly unpopular — derided as " the plastic pitch " , other clubs were starting to protest about Luton 's artificial pitch by 1989 . A meeting was held with other major clubs , mediated by a Football League Commission . The League Commission concluded that the pitch had suffered too much wear and tear from excessive use , and Luton installed a new surface during the summer of 1989 , at the cost of £ 60 @,@ 000 . This new artificial pitch was dug up during the summer of 1991 , as the surfaces were banned from English football . 
 = = = Away fan ban = = = 
 On 13 March 1985 , Millwall visited Kenilworth Road for an FA Cup sixth round match . After only 14 minutes the match was halted as the visiting fans began to riot . The referee took both teams off for 25 minutes , before bringing them back on to complete the match . Following the final whistle , and a 1 – 0 victory for Luton , another pitch invasion and subsequent riot by away supporters caused noticeable damage to the ground and the surrounding area . Many of those arrested turned out to be supporters of teams other than Millwall . The club 's chairman , David Evans , reacted by imposing a ban on all away supporters from Kenilworth Road from the start of 1986 – 87 , as well as introducing a scheme that would require even home supporters to carry membership cards to be admitted to matches . The Football League insisted that Luton relax the ban for League Cup matches , but when Evans refused to allow Cardiff City fans to visit Kenilworth Road for their second round tie , the club were thrown out of the competition . The ban continued for four seasons , with exceptions for cup matches , before Luton Town repealed the ban before the 1990 – 91 season . 
 = = = Ownership = = = 
 The ground was first constructed in 1905 , soon before the club moved in . The club rented the ground until 1933 , when newly appointed chairman Charles <unk> organised the purchase of the stadium . The club retained ownership of the ground until February 1989 , when the freehold was sold to Luton Borough Council for £ 3 @.@ 25 million . The club was granted a seven @-@ year lease at peppercorn rent for its continued use . This arrangement has been extended several times , and as of 2015 is due to end in 2028 . 
 = = Structure and facilities = = 
 The ground is made up of five stands — opposite the eponymous Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End , and to the left is the Main Stand , which is flanked to its right by the David Preece Stand . Opposite them stand a row of executive boxes . 
 The Main Stand covers approximately two thirds of the length of the pitch , though the attached enclosure is longer , covering the whole distance . The Main Stand , which seats 4 @,@ 277 fans , also contains the dressing rooms , club offices and television gantry , as well as a number of supporting pillars , a car park and the Nick Owen and Eric Morecambe suites . To the Main Stand 's right , in the corner above the end of the enclosure and next to the Kenilworth Stand , is the David Preece Stand , a family area which seats 711 spectators . The David Preece Stand acquired its present name in 2008 , a year after the former player 's death . 
 Opposite the Main and Preece Stands are 25 executive boxes , which have an attached net to catch balls directed over them and a total capacity of 209 . The Bobbers Stand stood here until 1986 , when the seats were removed from the stand and replaced with the boxes . 
 To the right of the Main Stand is the 3 @,@ 229 @-@ seater Kenilworth Stand , which backs onto Kenilworth Road . The Club Shop is behind this stand , which was once an open terrace but is now a roofed all @-@ seater stand . In the corner between the Kenilworth Stand and the boxes is the stadium clock . 
 Opposite the Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End , which bears an electronic scoreboard on its roof and can seat a maximum of 1 @,@ 800 fans . Originally a home section , the Oak Road End was turned into a stand for away fans only at the start of the 1991 – 92 season . Early in the 2013 – 14 season , the Oak Road End was re @-@ opened for home supporters for fixtures where visiting support was predicted to be especially low , with the section for away fans moved to A Block of the Kenilworth Stand for these games . Later that season , it was announced that the stand was available for shared use between both home and away supporters , increasing Kenilworth Road 's home capacity by 15 % . The Oak Road End has an entrance that is often considered unusual , requiring spectators to go through an entrance built into the row of houses and up stairs to the stand . 
 = = Future = = 
 Luton Town have been looking for a new ground since 1955 , when club chairman Percy Mitchell spoke of building a stadium " to hold 35 @,@ 000 in comfort ... [ and ] get a lot of support which goes to London at the moment " . However , due to unstable finances and an inability to find a site , no ground was built . The club proposed a move to Milton Keynes in 1982 — according to The Luton News , to play as " MK Hatters " in a " super @-@ stadium " — but this was prevented by vehement protests in Luton , where supporters against such a move marched through the town to display their feelings . Despite consistent fan opposition to the idea , relocation up the M1 motorway to the new town was raised several more times over the next two decades ; for example , The Football League refused Luton permission to move to Milton Keynes in 2000 , saying that a member club was not allowed to leave its home town . Wimbledon F.C. was granted permission to relocate there in 2002 , did so a year later and became Milton Keynes Dons in 2004 . 
 Luton have only managed to get as far as a planning application for a new ground once , when chairman David Kohler 's Kohlerdome was proposed in 1995 . The Kohlerdome was envisioned by Kohler as a 20 @,@ 000 all @-@ seater indoor arena with a retractable roof and pitch , hosting 85 capacity events each year . Kohler 's plans , though ambitious , were perhaps not very realistic — the plans were turned down by the Secretary of State in 1998 , with the reason given that the ground was not feasible unless the M1 motorway was widened . Kohler put the club on the market upon the plan 's rejection and after a period under Cliff Bassett , the club came under the control of Mike Watson @-@ Challis in 2000 . Watson @-@ Challis bought 55 acres ( 220 @,@ 000 m2 ) of land by Junction 10 of the M1 in 2001 , intending to move the club there , but once again , nothing came of the scheme . Most recently , in 2007 , <unk> Stadium Limited were hoping to relocate the club to a new purpose built stadium at Junction 12 , near Harlington and <unk> . This plan was very unpopular with both Luton Town supporters and the local authorities , but a planning application was still submitted by former chairman Bassett on the club 's behalf . The application was withdrawn by the club almost immediately after the takeover by Nick Owen 's Luton Town Football Club 2020 consortium in 2008 . 
 As of 2012 , the club is undertaking an independent feasibility study to determine a viable location to move to . Sites mooted include a ground built as part of a new housing development to the west of Luton and a site by the proposed Junction 11A of the M1 , which is the preferred site of the local authorities . Luton Town did not rule out staying at a redeveloped Kenilworth Road , entering talks to buy the stadium back from the council in October 2012 , but by mid @-@ 2015 these plans had been dropped in favour of a move to a new location . Managing Director Gary Sweet confirmed that the club was in a position to " buy land , secure the best possible professional advice ... and to see the [ planning ] application process through to the receipt of consent . " The club announced its new preferred location in December 2015 — Power Court in central Luton , near the Mall and St Anne 's Church . The proposals describe a 17 @,@ 500 @-@ seater stadium ready for the start of the 2020 – 21 season . 
 = = Other uses = = 
 Kenilworth Road has been used occasionally by the England women 's team . The inaugural UEFA Women 's Championship in 1984 saw Kenilworth Road play host to the second leg of the Final against Sweden , won by Sweden on penalties . The most recent use of the stadium by the women 's team was a 4 – 2 victory over Spain on 22 March 2001 .

 = Edwin Taylor Pollock = 
 Edwin Taylor Pollock ( October 25 , 1870 – June 4 , 1943 ) was a career officer in the United States Navy , serving in the Spanish – American War and in World War I. He was later promoted to the rank of captain . Like many naval officers , his name was often abbreviated using initials : E. T. Pollock . 
 As a young ensign , Pollock served aboard USS New York during the Spanish – American War . After the war , he rose through the ranks , served on several ships , and did important research into wireless communication . In 1917 , less than a week before the United States entered World War I , he won a race against a fellow officer to receive the U.S. Virgin Islands from Denmark , and served as the territory 's first acting governor . During the war , he was promoted to captain and a vessel under his command transported 60 @,@ 000 American soldiers to France , for which he was awarded a Navy Cross . Afterward , he was made the eighth Naval Governor of American Samoa and then the superintendent of the United States Naval Observatory , before retiring in 1927 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Originally from Mount Gilead , Ohio , Pollock attended the United States Naval Academy and , as a midshipman , was assigned to USS Lancaster and USS Monocacy . He graduated with a rank of ensign in 1893 . 
 After graduation , Pollock returned to Ohio and married Beatrice E. Law Hale on December 5 . Two weeks later , he was assigned to the cruiser USS New York during its initial shake @-@ down . He was subsequently assigned to the gunboat USS Machias for an expedition to China . He remained in China for two and a half years as part of the Asiatic Squadron , then transferring to USS Detroit before returning home in 1897 . On his return home , the Spanish – American War was heating up and he was reassigned to the New York , to see service in Cuba and Puerto Rico , eventually taking part in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba . 
 In January 1900 , he was promoted to lieutenant and assigned to USS Alliance . Over the following year he served on USS Dolphin and USS Buffalo . On board the Buffalo , he returned to the Asiatic Squadron near China and was finally transferred to USS Brooklyn , the squadron 's flagship . He remained on board the Brooklyn , until its return home in May 1902 . After a brief leave , Pollock was assigned to the USS Chesapeake ( as the watch and division officer ) , a position he held for more than one year . He was transferred to USS Cincinnati , serving for another year , and then to Cavite Naval Base . At Cavite , he was promoted to lieutenant commander in February 1906 . 
 His first duty as a lieutenant commander was on USS Alabama , as the navigator . In 1910 , Pollock was reassigned to USS Massachusetts , where he was promoted to commander in March 1911 . 
 On his promotion , Pollock commanded USS Virginia and USS Kearsarge , before being transferred to the United States Naval Observatory . During his command of the Kearsarge , Pollock briefly commanded USS Salem for a world @-@ record setting wireless experiment . For this feat , the Salem was outfitted with 16 different wireless telegraph technologies and sailed to Gibraltar , with Pollock commanding . On arrival , they tested these technologies and set a world @-@ record for longest wireless telegraph distance , 2 @,@ 400 miles ( 3 @,@ 900 km ) , using a " Poulsen Apparatus " , based on principles by Valdemar Poulsen . Experiments were also conducted to determine wireless characteristics during inclement weather and during both the day and night . In 1916 , he was put in command of USS Alabama , the ship on which he had been the navigator .

 In the final days before the entrance of the United States into World War I , the US military was concerned that Germany was planning to purchase or seize the Danish West Indies for use as a submarine or zeppelin base . At the time , Charlotte Amalie on Saint Thomas was considered the best port in the Caribbean outside of Cuba , and Coral Bay on Saint John was considered the safest harbor in the area . Although the United States was not yet at war with Germany , the US signed a treaty to purchase the territory from Denmark for 25 million dollars on March 28 , 1917 . President Woodrow Wilson nominated James Harrison Oliver to be the first military governor . The United States announced plans to build a naval base in the territory to aid in the protection of the Panama Canal . 
 Oliver was unable to travel immediately to the Islands and the honor of being the first Acting Governor of the United States Virgin Islands was decided in an unusual way . Both Pollock , commanding USS Hancock , and B. B. <unk> 's USS Olympia were dispatched to the Islands in a race . The commander of the ship that arrived first would officiate at the transfer ceremony and be acting governor . Pollock arrived first and the transfer ceremony took place on March 31 , 1917 , on Saint Thomas . <unk> officiated at a smaller ceremony on Saint Croix . Present for the handover was the crew of the Danish station cruiser Valkyrien and the former island legislature . The United States declared war on Germany on April 6 , less than a week after securing the islands . Oliver was confirmed by Congress on April 20 and relieved Pollock as governor . 
 = = World War I = = 
 During the war , Pollock was appointed as Captain on USS George Washington , a German cruise liner which was seized by the United States government for use as a military transport ship . She was rechristened George Washington in September 1917 and Pollock was given her command on October 1 , 1917 . That December , she set out with her first load of troops . During the war , Pollock successfully transported 60 @,@ 000 American soldiers to France in 18 round trips . In 1918 , the George Washington was tasked to deliver President Woodrow Wilson to the Paris Peace Conference , though Pollock would not make the trip . He was reassigned on September 29 , 1918 . 
 While on board the George Washington , Pollock and Chaplain Paul F. <unk> edited a daily newspaper . After the war , stories from the paper were assembled and published in 1919 by J. J. Little & Ives co. as Hatchet of the United States Ship " George Washington " . A short review of the work by Outlook magazine called the book " readable " and " admirably illustrated " . It " abounds in clever bits of fun , queer and notable incidents , and sound and patriotic editorials . " After the war , he was eventually reassigned to the battleship USS Oklahoma , to serve in the Pacific fleet . On November 10 , 1920 , Pollock was awarded a Navy Cross for his services during the war . 
 = = American Samoa = = 
 On November 30 , 1921 , Pollock was transferred from command of the Oklahoma to become the Military Governor of American Samoa . Events both personal and political had led to a previous governor , Warren Terhune 's , suicide on November 3 , 1920 , and the appointment of Governor Waldo A. Evans to conduct a court of inquiry into the situation and to restore order . Pollock succeeded Evans , who had successfully restored the government and productivity of the islands after a period of unrest . At this time , American Samoa was administered by a team of twelve officers and a governor , with a total population of approximately 8 @,@ 000 people . The islands were primarily important due to the excellent harbor at Pago Pago . 
 Beginning in 1920 , a Mau movement , from the Samoan word for " opposition " , was forming in American Samoa in protest of several Naval government policies , some of which had been implemented by Terhune but which were not revoked following his death , which natives ( and some non @-@ natives ) found heavy @-@ handed . The movement itself may have been inspired by a different and older Mau movement in nearby Western Samoa , against the German and then New Zealand colonial powers . Some of the initial grievances of the movement included the quality of roads in the territory , a marriage law which largely forbade natives from marrying non @-@ natives , and a justice system which discriminated against locals in part because laws were not often available in Samoan . In addition , the United States Navy also prohibited an assembly of Samoan chiefs , whom the movement considered the real government of the territory . Surprisingly , the movement had grown to include several prominent officers of former Governor Terhune 's staff , including his executive officer . It culminated in a proclamation by Samuel S. Ripley , an American Samoan from an <unk> or mixed @-@ blood Samoan family , with large communal property in the islands , that he was the leader of a legitimate successor government to pre @-@ 1899 Samoa . Evans also met with the high chiefs and secured their assent to continued Naval government . Ripley , who had traveled to Washington to meet with Secretary of the Navy Edwin C. Denby , was not permitted by Evans to enter the port at American Samoa and returned to exile in California , where he later became the mayor of Richmond . 
 After being appointed as governor , Pollock 's continued the colonization work started by his predecessor . Prior to traveling to the territory , he met with Ripley in San Francisco , California . Although Ripley maintained that American " occupation " of Samoa was usurpation , he agreed to allow Pollock to govern unfettered and to provide him with copies of his letters . Almost immediately after arriving on the island , Pollock and Secretary of Native Affairs S. D. Hall met with representatives of the Mau , becoming the first governor to do so . Shortly afterwards , some members of the Mau disbanded , though the movement would continue in some form for another 13 years . 
 Pollock 's remaining time as governor was less eventful . While exploring Tonga in May 1923 , he discovered a turtle which had been branded by Captain Cook on his expedition there in 1773 . The turtle was thus known to have lived more than 150 years . He was ordered home on July 26 , 1923 .

 = Assassination of Spencer Perceval = 
 Spencer Perceval , the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , was shot and killed in the lobby of the House of Commons in London , at about 5 : 15 pm on Monday 11 May 1812 . His assailant was John Bellingham , a Liverpool merchant with a grievance against the government . Bellingham was detained and , four days after the murder , was tried , convicted and sentenced to death . He was hanged at Newgate Prison on 18 May . 
 Perceval had led the Tory government since 1809 , during a critical phase of the Napoleonic Wars . His determination to prosecute the war using the harshest of measures caused widespread poverty and unrest on the home front ; thus the news of his death was a cause of rejoicing in the worst affected parts of the country . Despite initial fears that the assassination might be linked to a general uprising , it transpired that Bellingham had acted alone , protesting against the government 's failure to compensate him for his treatment a few years previously , when he had been imprisoned in Russia for a trading debt . Bellingham 's lack of remorse , and apparent certainty that his action was justified , raised questions about his sanity , but at his trial he was judged to be legally responsible for his actions . 
 After Perceval 's death , Parliament made generous provision to his widow and children , and approved the erection of monuments . Thereafter his ministry was soon forgotten , his policies reversed , and he is generally better known for the manner of his death than for any of his achievements . Later historians have characterised Bellingham 's hasty trial and execution as contrary to the principles of justice . The possibility that he was acting within a conspiracy , on behalf of a consortium of Liverpool traders hostile to Perceval 's economic policies , is the subject of a 2012 study . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Biographical details = = = 
 Spencer Perceval was born on 1 November 1762 , the second son from the second marriage of John Perceval , 2nd Earl of Egmont . He attended Harrow School and , in 1780 , entered Trinity College , Cambridge , where he was a noted scholar and prizewinner . A deeply religious boy , at Cambridge he became closely aligned with evangelicalism , to which he remained faithful all his life . Under the rule of primogeniture , Perceval had no realistic prospect of a family inheritance , and needed to earn his living ; on leaving Cambridge in 1783 , he entered Lincoln 's Inn to train as a lawyer . After being called to the bar in 1786 , Perceval joined the Midland Circuit , where his family connections helped him to acquire a lucrative practice . In 1790 he married Jane Wilson , the couple having eloped on her 21st birthday . The marriage proved happy and prolific ; twelve children ( six sons and six daughters ) were born over the following 14 years . 
 Perceval 's politics were highly conservative , and he acquired a reputation for his attacks on radicalism . As a junior prosecuting counsel in the trials of Thomas Paine and John Horne Tooke , he was noticed by senior politicians in the ruling Pitt ministry . In 1796 , having refused the post of Chief Secretary for Ireland , Perceval was elected to parliament as the Tory member for Northampton , and won acclaim in 1798 with a speech defending Pitt 's government against attacks by the radicals Charles James Fox and Francis Burdett . He was generally seen as a rising star in his party ; his short stature and slight build earned him the nickname " Little P " . 
 After William Pitt 's resignation in 1801 , Perceval served as Solicitor General , and then as Attorney General , in the Addington ministry of 1801 – 04 , continuing in the latter office through Pitt 's second government , 1804 – 06 . Perceval 's deep evangelical convictions led him to his unwavering opposition to the Catholic Church and to Catholic emancipation , and his equally fervent support for the abolition of the slave trade , when he worked with fellow evangelicals such as William Wilberforce to secure the passage of the Slave Trade Act 1807 . 
 When Pitt died in 1806 his government was succeeded by the cross @-@ party " Ministry of All the Talents " , under Lord Grenville . Perceval remained in opposition during this short @-@ lived ministry , but when the Duke of Portland formed a new Tory administration in March 1807 , Perceval took office as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons . Portland was elderly and ailing , and on his resignation in October 1809 , Perceval succeeded him as First Lord of the Treasury — the formal title by which prime ministers were then known — after a wounding internecine leadership struggle . In addition to his duties as head of the government he retained the Chancellorship , largely because he could find no minister of appropriate stature who would accept the office . 
 = = = Troubled times = = = 
 Perceval 's government was weakened by the refusals to serve of former ministers such as George Canning and William Huskisson . It faced massive problems at a time of considerable industrial unrest and at a low point in the war against Napoleon . The unsuccessful Walcheren Campaign in the Netherlands was unravelling , and the army of Sir Arthur Wellesley , the future Duke of Wellington , was pinned down in Portugal . At the outset of his ministry Perceval enjoyed the strong support of King George III , but in October 1810 the king lapsed into insanity and was permanently incapacitated . Perceval 's relationship with the Prince of Wales , who became Prince Regent , was initially far less cordial , but in the following months he and Perceval established a reasonable affinity , perhaps motivated in part by the prince 's fear that the king might recover and find his favourite statesman deposed . 
 When the final British forces withdrew from Walcheren in February 1810 , Wellington 's force in Portugal was Britain 's only military presence on the continent of Europe . Perceval insisted that it stayed there , against the advice of most of his ministers and at great cost to the British exchequer . Ultimately this decision was vindicated , but for the time being his main weapon against Napoleon was the Orders in Council of 1807 , inherited from the previous ministry . These had been issued as a tit @-@ for @-@ tat response to Napoleon 's Continental System , a measure designed to destroy Britain 's overseas trade . The Orders permitted the Royal Navy to detain any ship thought to be carrying goods to France or its continental allies . With both warring powers employing similar strategies , world trade shrank , leading to widespread hardship and dissatisfaction in key British industries , particularly textiles and cotton . There were frequent calls for modification or repeal of the Orders , which damaged relations with the United States to the point that , by early 1812 , the two nations were on the brink of war . 
 At home , Perceval upheld his earlier reputation as scourge of radicals , imprisoning Burdett and William Cobbett , the latter of whom continued to attack the government from his prison cell . Perceval was also faced with the anti @-@ machine protests known as " Luddism " , to which he reacted by introducing a bill making machine @-@ breaking a capital offence ; in the House of Lords the youthful Lord Byron called the legislation " barbarous " . Despite these difficulties Perceval gradually established his authority , so that in 1811 Lord Liverpool , the war minister , observed that the Prime Minister 's authority in the House now equalled that of Pitt . Perceval 's use of sinecures and other patronage to secure loyalties meant that by May 1812 , despite much public protest against his harsh policies , his political position had become unassailable . According to the humorist Sydney Smith , Perceval combined " the head of a country parson with the tongue of an Old Bailey lawyer " . 
 Early in 1812 agitation for repeal of the Orders in Council increased . After riots in Manchester in April , Perceval consented to a House of Commons enquiry into the operation of the Orders ; hearings began in May . Perceval was expected to attend the session on 11 May 1812 ; among the crowd in the lobby awaiting his arrival was a Liverpool merchant , John Bellingham . 
 = = John Bellingham = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Bellingham was born in about 1770 , in the county of Huntingdonshire . His father , also named John , was a land agent and miniaturist painter ; his mother Elizabeth was from a well @-@ to @-@ do Huntingdonshire family . In 1779 John senior became mentally ill , and , after confinement in an asylum , died in 1780 or 1781 . The family were then provided for by William Daw , Elizabeth 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , a prosperous lawyer who arranged Bellingham 's appointment as an officer cadet on board the East India Company 's ship Hartwell . En route to India the ship was wrecked ; Bellingham survived and returned home . Daw then helped him to set up in business as a tin plate manufacturer in London , but after a few years the business failed , and Bellingham was made bankrupt in 1794 . He appears to have escaped debtors ' prison , perhaps through the further intervention of Daw . Chastened by this experience , he decided to settle down , and obtained a post as a book @-@ keeper with a firm engaged in trade with Russia . He worked hard , and was sufficiently regarded by his employers to be appointed in 1800 as the firm 's resident representative in Archangel , Russia . On his return home , Bellingham set up his own trading business , and moved to Liverpool . In 1803 he married Mary Neville from Dublin . 
 = = = In Russia = = = 
 In 1804 Bellingham returned to Archangel to supervise a major commercial venture , accompanied by Mary and their infant son . His business completed , in November he prepared to return home , but was detained on account of a supposed unpaid debt . This arose from losses incurred by a business associate for which Bellingham was deemed liable . He denied any responsibility for the debt ; his detention , he thought , was an act of revenge by powerful Russian merchants who — erroneously — thought that he had frustrated an insurance claim relating to a lost ship . Two arbitrators appointed by the governor of Archangel determined that he was responsible for a sum of 2 @,@ 000 roubles ( about £ 200 ) , a fraction of the original amount claimed . Bellingham rejected this judgement . 
 With the issue still unresolved , Bellingham obtained passes for him and his family to travel to the Russian capital , St Petersburg . In February 1805 , as they prepared to set out , Bellingham 's pass was revoked ; Mary and the child were permitted to proceed , but he was arrested and imprisoned in Archangel . When he sought help from Lord Granville Leveson @-@ Gower , the British ambassador in St Petersburg , the matter was dealt with by the British consul , Sir Stephen <unk> , who informed Bellingham that as the dispute involved a civil debt , he could not interfere . Bellingham remained in custody in Archangel until November 1805 , when a new city governor ordered his release and allowed him to join Mary in St Petersburg . Here , instead of arranging his family 's swift return to England , Bellingham laid charges against the Archangel authorities for false imprisonment , and demanded compensation . In doing so he outraged the Russian authorities , who in June 1806 ordered his imprisonment . According to his later account , he was " often marched publicly through the city with gangs of felons and criminals of the worse description [ to the ] heart @-@ rending humiliation of himself " . 
 Mary had meanwhile returned to England with her son ( she was pregnant with her second child ) , eventually settling in Liverpool where she set up a millinery business with a friend , Mary Stevens . For the next three years Bellingham made constant demands for release and compensation , seeking help from <unk> , Leveson @-@ Gower , and the latter 's successor as ambassador , Lord Douglas . None were prepared to intercede on his behalf : " Thus " , he later wrote when petitioning for redress , " without having offended any law , either civil or criminal , and without having injured any individual ... was your <unk> bandied from one prison to another " . Bellingham 's position worsened in 1807 , when Russia signed the Treaty of Tilsit and aligned itself with Napoleon . Two further years passed before , after a direct petition to Tsar Alexander , he was released and ordered to leave Russia . He arrived in England , uncompensated , in December 1809 , determined to secure justice . 
 = = = Seeking redress = = = 
 On his return to England Bellingham spent six months in London , seeking compensation for the imprisonment and financial losses he had suffered in Russia . He considered the British authorities were responsible , through their neglect of his repeated requests for help . Successively he petitioned the Foreign Office , the Treasury , the Privy Council , and Perceval himself ; in each case his claims were politely rejected . Defeated and exhausted , in May 1811 Bellingham accepted his wife 's ultimatum to abandon his campaign or otherwise lose her and his family . He joined her in Liverpool to begin life afresh . 
 During the following 18 months , Bellingham worked to rebuild his commercial career , with modest success . Mary continued to work as a milliner . The fact that he remained uncompensated continued to <unk> . In December 1811 he returned to London , ostensibly to conduct business there , but in reality to resume his campaign for redress . He petitioned the Prince Regent , before resuming his efforts with the Privy Council , the Home Office and the Treasury , only to receive the same polite refusals as before . He then sent a copy of his petition to every member of parliament , again to no avail . On 23 March 1812 he wrote to the magistrates at Bow Street Magistrates ' Court , arguing that the government had " completely endeavoured to close the door of justice " , and asking the court to intervene . He received a perfunctory reply . After consulting his own MP , Isaac Gascoyne , Bellingham made a final attempt to present his case to the government . On 18 April he met with a Treasury official , Mr Hill , to whom he said that if he could get no satisfaction , he would take justice into his own hands . Hill , not perceiving these words as a threat , told him he should take whatever action he deemed proper . On 20 April , Bellingham purchased two .50 calibre ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) pistols from a gunsmith of 58 Skinner Street . He also had a tailor sew an inside pocket to his coat .

 = = = House of Commons , 11 May 1812 = = = 
 Bellingham 's presence in the House of Commons lobby on Monday 11 May , caused no particular suspicion ; he had made several recent visits , sometimes asking journalists to confirm specific ministers ' identities . Bellingham 's activities earlier that day did not overtly indicate a man preparing desperate measures . He had spent the morning writing letters and visiting his wife 's business partner , Mary Stevens , who was in London at the time . In the afternoon he had accompanied his landlady and her son on a visit to the European Museum , in the St James 's district of London . From there he made his way alone to the parliament buildings in Westminster , arriving in the lobby shortly before five o 'clock . 
 In the House , as the session began at 4 @.@ 30 pm , the Whig MP Henry Brougham , a leading opponent of the Orders , drew attention to the Prime Minister 's absence and remarked that he ought to be there . A messenger was sent to fetch Perceval from Downing Street , but met him in Parliament Street ( Perceval having decided to walk and dispense with his usual carriage ) on his way to the House , where he arrived at about 5 @.@ 15 . As Perceval entered the lobby , he was confronted by Bellingham who , drawing a pistol , shot the Prime Minister in the chest . Perceval staggered forward a few steps and exclaimed " I am murdered ! " before falling face down at the feet of William Smith , the MP for Norwich . ( It was also variously reported Perceval had said " Murder " or " Oh my God " . ) Smith only realised that the victim was Perceval when he turned the body face upwards . By the time he had been carried into an adjoining room and propped up on a table with his feet on two chairs , he was senseless , although there was still a faint pulse . When a surgeon arrived a few minutes later , the pulse had stopped , and Perceval was declared dead . 
 In the pandemonium that followed , Bellingham sat quietly on a bench as Perceval was carried into the Speaker 's quarters . In the lobby , such was the confusion that , according to a witness , had Bellingham " walked quietly out into the street , he would have escaped , and the <unk> of the murder would never have been known " . As it was , an official who had seen the shooting identified Bellingham , who was seized , disarmed , manhandled and searched . He remained calm , submitting to his captors without a struggle . When asked to explain his actions , he replied that he was rectifying a denial of justice on the part of the government . 
 The Speaker ordered that Bellingham be transferred to the Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Arms 's quarters , where MPs who were also magistrates would conduct a committal hearing under the chairmanship of Harvey Christian Combe . The makeshift court heard evidence from eyewitnesses to the crime , and sent messengers to search Bellingham 's lodgings . The prisoner kept his composure throughout ; although warned against self @-@ incrimination , he insisted on explaining himself : " I have been ill @-@ treated ... I have sought redress in vain . I am a most unfortunate man and feel here " — placing hand on heart — " sufficient justification for what I have done . " He had , he said , exhausted all proper avenues , and had made it clear to the authorities that he proposed to take independent action . He had been told to do his worst : " I have obeyed them . I have done my worst , and I rejoice in the deed . " At around eight o 'clock , Bellingham was formally charged with Perceval 's murder , and was committed to Newgate Prison to await trial . 
 = = = Reaction = = = 
 Reports of the assassination spread quickly ; in his history of the times , Arthur Bryant records the crude delight with which the news was received by hungry workers who had received nothing but woe from Perceval 's government . In his prison cell , Cobbett understood their feelings ; the shooting had " <unk> them of one whom they looked upon as the leader among those whom they thought totally bent on the destruction of their liberties " . The scenes outside the Palace of Westminster as Bellingham was taken out for transfer to Newgate were consistent with this mood ; Samuel Romilly , the law reformer and MP for Wareham , heard from the assembled crowd " the most savage expressions of joy and exultation ... accompanied with regret that others , and particularly the attorney general , had not shared the same fate " . The throng surged around the hackney coach carrying Bellingham ; many tried to shake his hand , others mounted the coach @-@ box and had to be beaten off with whips . He was hustled back into the building , and kept there until the disorder had died down sufficiently for him to be moved , with a full military escort . 
 Among the governing classes there were initial fears that the assassination might be part of a general insurrection , or might spark one . The authorities took precautions ; the Foot Guards and mounted troops were deployed , as was the City militia , while local watches were reinforced . In contrast to the public 's evident approval of Bellingham 's actions , the mood among Perceval 's friends and colleagues was sombre and sorrowful . When parliament met the next day , George Canning spoke of " a man ... of whom it might with particular truth be said that , whatever was the strength of political hostility , he had never before that last calamity provoked a single enemy " . After further tributes from government and opposition members , the House moved a grant of £ 50 @,@ 000 and an annuity of £ 2 @,@ 000 to Perceval 's widow , which provision , slightly amended , was approved in June . 
 The regard in which Perceval was held by his peers was made evident in an anonymous 1812 poem , " Universal Sympathy , or , The Martyr 'd Statesman " :

 = = = Preliminaries = = = 
 An inquest into Perceval 's death was held on 12 May , at the Rose and Crown public house in Downing Street . Among those who gave evidence were Gascoyne , Smith , and Joseph Hume , a doctor and Radical MP . He had helped to detain Bellingham , and now testified that from his controlled behaviour after the shooting , Bellingham appeared " perfectly sane " . The coroner duly registered the cause of death as " wilful murder by John Bellingham " . Armed with this verdict the Attorney General , Sir Vicary Gibbs , requested the Lord Chief Justice to arrange the earliest possible trial date . 
 In Newgate prison , Bellingham was questioned by magistrates . His calm demeanour and poise led them , unlike Hume , to doubt his sanity , although his keepers had observed no signs of unbalanced behaviour . James Harmer , Bellingham 's solicitor , knew that insanity would provide the only conceivable defence for his client , and despatched agents to Liverpool to make enquiries there . While awaiting their reports he learned from an informant that Bellingham 's father had died insane ; he also heard evidence of Bellingham 's supposed derangement from Ann Billett , the prisoner 's cousin , who had known him from childhood . On 14 May a grand jury met in the Sessions House , Clerkenwell , and after hearing evidence from the eyewitnesses , found " a true Bill against John Bellingham for the murder of Spencer Perceval " . The trial was arranged to take place the next day , Friday 15 May 1812 , at the Old Bailey . 
 When Bellingham received news of his forthcoming trial he asked Harmer to arrange for him to be represented in court by Brougham and Peter Alley , the latter an Irish lawyer with a reputation for flamboyance . Confident of his acquittal , Bellingham refused to discuss the case further with Harmer , and spent the afternoon and evening making notes . After drinking a glass of porter , he went to bed and slept soundly . 
 = = = Trial = = = 
 The trial began at the Old Bailey on Friday 15 May 1812 , under the presiding judge Sir James Mansfield , Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas . The prosecuting team was led by the Attorney General , Gibbs , whose assistants included William Garrow , himself a future Attorney General . Brougham having declined , Bellingham was represented by Alley , assisted by Henry Revell Reynolds . The law at that time limited the role of defending counsel in capital cases ; they could advise on points of law , and could examine and cross @-@ examine witnesses , but otherwise Bellingham would have to present his own defence . 
 After Bellingham had entered a not guilty plea , Alley asked for a postponement to allow him time to locate witnesses who could attest to the prisoner 's insanity . This was opposed by Gibbs as a mere ploy to delay justice ; Mansfield concurred , and the trial proceeded . Gibbs then summarised the prisoner 's business activities before meeting misfortune in Russia — " whether through his own misconduct or by the justice or injustice of that country , I know not " . He recounted Bellingham 's unsuccessful efforts to obtain redress , and the consequent growth of a desire for revenge . 
 Having described the shooting , Gibbs dismissed the possibility of insanity , maintaining that Bellingham was , at the time of the deed , fully in control of his actions . Numerous eyewitnesses testified to what they had seen in the Commons lobby . The court also heard from a tailor who , shortly before the attack had , on Bellingham 's instructions , modified the latter 's coat by adding a special inside pocket , in which Bellingham had concealed his pistols . 
 When Bellingham rose , he thanked the attorney general for rejecting the " insanity " strategy : " I think it is far more fortunate that such a plea ... should have been unfounded , than it should have existed in fact " . He began his defence by asserting that " all the miseries which it is possible for human nature to endure " had fallen on him . He then read the petition that he had sent to the Prince Regent , and recalled his fruitless dealings with various government agencies . In his view the principal blame lay not with " that truly amiable and highly lamented individual , Mr Perceval " , but with Leveson @-@ Gower , the ambassador in St Petersburg who he felt had originally denied him justice , and who he said deserved the shot rather than the eventual victim . 
 Bellingham 's main witnesses were Ann Billett and her friend , Mary Clarke , both of whom testified to his history of derangement , and Catherine Figgins , a servant in Bellingham 's lodgings . She had found him recently confused , but otherwise an honest and admirable lodger . As she stood down , Alley informed the court that two more witnesses had arrived from Liverpool . However , when they saw Bellingham , they realised that he was not the man to whose derangement they had come to attest , and withdrew . Mansfield then began his summing up , during the course of which he clarified the law : " The single question is whether at the time this act was committed , he possessed a sufficient degree of understanding to distinguish good from evil , right from wrong " . The judge advised the jury before they retired that the evidence showed Bellingham to be " in every respect a full and competent judge of all his actions " . 
 = = = Verdict and sentence = = = 
 The jury retired , and within 15 minutes returned with a guilty verdict . Bellingham appeared surprised but , from Thomas Hodgson 's contemporary trial account , was calm , " with [ out ] any demonstrations of that concern which the awfulness of his situation was calculate to produce " . Asked by the court clerk if he had anything to say , he remained silent . 
 The clerk then read the sentence , Hodgson records , " in a most solemn and affecting manner , which bathed many of the auditors in tears " . First , he damned the crime , " as odious and abominable in the eyes of God as it is hateful and abhorrent to the feelings of man " . He reminded the prisoner of the short time , " a very short time " , that remained for him to seek for mercy in another world , and then pronounced the sentence of death itself : " You shall be hanged by the neck until you be dead , your body to be dissected and <unk> " . The entire trial had lasted less than eight hours . 
 = = = Execution = = = 
 Bellingham 's execution was fixed for the morning of Monday 18 May . The day before , he was visited by the Revd Daniel Wilson , curate at St John 's Chapel , Bedford Row , a future Bishop of Calcutta , who hoped that Bellingham would show true repentance for his act . The clergyman was disappointed , concluding that " a more dreadful instance of depravity and hardness of heart has surely never occurred " . Late on Sunday , Bellingham wrote a last letter to his wife , in which he appeared confident of his soul 's destination : " Nine hours more will waft me to those happy shores where bliss is without alloy " . 
 Large crowds gathered outside Newgate on Monday ; a force of troops stood by , since warnings had been received of a " Rescue Bellingham " movement . The crowd was calm and restrained , as was Bellingham when he appeared at the scaffold shortly before 8 o 'clock . Hodgson records that Bellingham mounted the steps " with the utmost celerity ... his tread was bold and firm ... no indication of trembling , faltering , or <unk> appeared " . Bellingham was then blindfolded , the rope fastened , and a final prayer was said by the chaplain . As the clock struck eight the trap door was released , and Bellingham dropped to his death . Cobbett , still incarcerated in Newgate , observed the crowd 's reactions : " anxious looks ... half @-@ horrified countenances ... mournful tears ... unanimous blessings " . In accordance with the court 's sentence , the body was cut down and sent to St Bartholomew 's Hospital for dissection . In what the press described as " morbid sensationalism " , Bellingham 's clothes were sold for high prices to members of the public . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On 15 May , the House of Commons voted for the erection of a monument to the assassinated Prime Minister in Westminster Abbey . Later , memorials were placed in Lincoln 's Inn , and within Perceval 's Northampton constituency . 
 On 8 June the Regent appointed Lord Liverpool to head a new Tory administration . Despite their eulogies to their fallen leader , members of the new government soon began to distance themselves from his ministry . Many of the changes that Perceval had opposed were gradually introduced : greater press freedom , Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform . The Orders in Council were repealed on 23 June , but too late to avoid the declaration of war on Britain by the United States . Lord Liverpool 's government did not maintain Perceval 's resolution in acting against the illegal slave trade , which began to flourish as the authorities looked the other way . Linklater estimates that around 40 @,@ 000 slaves were illegally transported from Africa to the West Indies , because of lax enforcement of the law . 
 Linklater cites Perceval 's greatest achievement as his insistence on keeping Wellington 's army in the field , a policy which helped to turn the tide in the Napoleonic Wars decisively in Britain 's favour . Despite this , with the passage of time Perceval 's reputation faded ; Charles Dickens considered him " a third @-@ rate politician scarcely fit to carry Lord Chatham 's crutch " . In due course , little but the fact of his assassination lingered in public memory . As the bicentenary of the shooting approached , Perceval was described in newspapers as " the prime minister that history forgot " . 
 The justice of Bellingham 's conviction was first questioned by Brougham , who condemned the trial as " the greatest disgrace to English justice " . In a study published in 2004 the American academic Kathleen S. Goddard criticises the timing of the trial so soon after the act , when passions were running high . She also draws attention to the court 's refusal to allow an adjournment that would permit the defence to contact possible witnesses . There was , she maintains , insufficient evidence produced at the trial to determine the true state of Bellingham 's sanity , and Mansfield 's summing @-@ up showed significant bias . Bellingham 's claim to have acted alone was accepted in court ; Linklater 's 2012 study posits that he could been an agent of other interests — perhaps Liverpool merchants , who bore the main brunt of Perceval 's economic policies and had much to gain by his demise . Comments by a Liverpool newspaper , says Linklater , indicate that talk of assassination was common in the city . It remains unknown how Bellingham gained the funds to spend freely in the months preceding the assassination , when he was not apparently engaged in any business . This conspiracy theory has not convinced other historians ; the columnist Bruce Anderson points to the lack of any concrete evidence to support it . 
 In the months immediately following her husband 's execution , Mary Bellingham continued to live and work in Liverpool . By the end of 1812 her business had failed , and thereafter her movements are obscure ; she may have reverted to her maiden name . In January 1815 , Jane Perceval married Sir Henry William Carr ; she died , aged 74 , in 1844 . 
 In 1828 , The Times reported that Cornish industrialist landowner , John Williams the Third ( 1753 @-@ 1841 ) received a dream warning of Perceval 's assassination on 2 or 3 May 1812 , nearly ten days before the event , " correct in every detail " . 
 A distant kinsman of the assassin , Henry Bellingham , became Conservative MP for North West Norfolk in 1983 , and held junior office in the Conservative @-@ Liberal coalition government of 2010 – 15 . When he temporarily lost his seat in 1997 — he regained it in 2001 — his narrow defeat was widely regarded as arising from the intervention of Roger Percival , the candidate for the Referendum Party whose votes largely came from disgruntled Conservatives . Despite the different spelling , media accounts asserted Percival 's descent from the assassinated Prime Minister 's family , and reported the defeat as a belated form of revenge . 
 The greater part of the Palace of Westminster ( Westminster Hall apart ) that stood at the time of the assassination was destroyed by an accidental fire in 1834 , following which the Houses were comprehensively rebuilt and expanded . In July 2014 , a brass memorial plaque was unveiled in St Stephen 's Hall , Houses of Parliament , close to the place where Perceval was killed . Michael Ellis , Conservative MP for Northampton North ( part of Perceval 's old Northampton constituency ) had campaigned for the plaque after four patterned floor tiles that were said to mark the spot had been removed by workmen in a recent renovation .

 = Battle of Vimy Ridge = 
 The Battle of Vimy Ridge was a military engagement fought primarily as part of the Battle of Arras , in the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region of France , during the First World War . The main combatants were the Canadian Corps , of four divisions , against three divisions of the German Sixth Army . The battle , which took place from 9 to 12 April 1917 , was part of the opening phase of the British @-@ led Battle of Arras , a diversionary attack for the French Nivelle Offensive . 
 The objective of the Canadian Corps was to take control of the German @-@ held high ground along an escarpment at the northernmost end of the Arras Offensive . This would ensure that the southern flank could advance without suffering German enfilade fire . Supported by a creeping barrage , the Canadian Corps captured most of the ridge during the first day of the attack . The town of Thélus fell during the second day of the attack , as did the crest of the ridge once the Canadian Corps overcame a salient against considerable German resistance . The final objective , a fortified knoll located outside the village of Givenchy @-@ en @-@ Gohelle , fell to the Canadian Corps on 12 April . The German forces then retreated to the Oppy – Méricourt line . 
 Historians attribute the success of the Canadian Corps in capturing the ridge to a mixture of technical and tactical innovation , meticulous planning , powerful artillery support and extensive training , as well as the failure of the German Sixth Army to properly apply the new German defensive doctrine . The battle was the first occasion when all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle together and it was made a symbol of Canadian national achievement and sacrifice . A 100 @-@ hectare ( 250 @-@ acre ) portion of the former battleground serves as a memorial park and site of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial . 
 = = Background = = 
 Vimy Ridge is an escarpment 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) northeast of Arras on the western edge of the Douai Plains . The ridge rises gradually on its western side , and drops more quickly on the eastern side . At approximately 7 km ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) in length , and culminating at an elevation of 145 m ( 476 ft ) or 60 m ( 200 ft ) above the Douai Plains , the ridge provides a natural unobstructed view for tens of kilometres in all directions . 
 The ridge fell under German control in October 1914 during the Race to the Sea as the Franco @-@ British and German forces continually attempted to outflank each other through northeastern France . The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette . The French 1st Moroccan Division managed to briefly capture the height of the ridge but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements . The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915 but only captured the town of Souchez at the western base of the ridge . The Vimy sector calmed following the offensive with both sides taking a largely live and let live approach . In all , the French suffered approximately 150 @,@ 000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory . 
 The British XVII Corps , commanded by Lieutenant @-@ General Sir Julian Byng , relieved the French Tenth Army in the sector in February 1916 , permitting the French to expand their operations at Verdun . The British soon discovered that German tunnelling companies had taken advantage of the relative calm on the surface to build an extensive network of tunnels and deep mines from which they would attack French positions by setting off explosive charges underneath their trenches . The Royal Engineers immediately deployed specialist tunnelling companies along the front to combat the German mining operations . In response to increased British mining aggression , German artillery and trench mortar fire intensified in early May 1916 . On 21 May 1916 , after shelling both forward trenches and divisional artillery positions from no less than 80 out @-@ of @-@ sight batteries on the reverse slope of the ridge , the German infantry began operation Schleswig Holstein , an attack on the British lines along a 1 @,@ 800 @-@ metre ( 2 @,@ 000 yd ) front in an effort to eject them from positions along the ridge . The Germans captured several British @-@ controlled tunnels and mine craters before halting their advance and entrenching their positions . Small counterattacks by units of the 140th and 141st British Brigades took place on 22 May but did not manage to change the situation . The Canadian Corps relieved the British IV Corps stationed along the western slopes of Vimy Ridge in October 1916 .

 = = = Strategic planning = = = 
 On 28 May 1916 , Byng took command of the Canadian Corps from Lieutenant @-@ General Sir Edwin Alderson . Formal discussions for a spring offensive near Arras began following a conference of corps commanders held at British First Army Headquarters on 21 November 1916 . In March 1917 , British First Army headquarters formally presented Byng with orders outlining Vimy Ridge as the corps 's objective for the Arras Offensive . A formal assault plan , adopted in early March 1917 , drew heavily on the briefings of staff officers sent to learn from the experiences of the French Army during the Battle of Verdun . 
 For the first time all four Canadian divisions were assembled to participate in a battle . The nature and size of the planned Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities . Consequently , the British 5th Infantry Division and supplementary artillery , engineer and labour units reinforced the four Canadian divisions . This brought the nominal strength of the Canadian Corps to about 170 @,@ 000 men , of whom 97 @,@ 184 were Canadian . 
 = = = Tactical plan = = = 
 In January 1917 , three Canadian Corps officers accompanied other British and Dominion officers attending a series of lectures hosted by the French Army regarding their experiences during the Battle of Verdun . The French counter offensive devised by General Robert Nivelle had been one of a number of Allied successes of 1916 . Following extensive rehearsal , eight French divisions had assaulted German positions in two waves along a 9 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometre ( 6 mi ) front . Supported by exceedingly strong artillery , the French had recovered lost ground and inflicted heavy casualties on five German divisions . 
 On their return from the lectures , the Canadian Corps staff officers produced a tactical analysis of the Verdun battles and delivered a series of corps and divisional @-@ level lectures to promote the primacy of artillery and stress the importance of harassing fire and company and platoon flexibility . The report of 1st Canadian Division commander Arthur Currie highlighted the lessons he believed the Canadian Corps could learn from the experiences of the French . The final plan for the assault on Vimy Ridge drew heavily on the experience and tactical analysis of the officers who attended the Verdun lectures . British First Army commander General Henry Horne approved the plan on 5 March 1917 . 
 The plan divided the Canadian Corps advance into four coloured objective lines . The attack would be made on a front of 6 @,@ 400 m ( 7 @,@ 000 yd ) , with its centre opposite the village of Vimy , to the east of the ridge . The first objective , represented by the Black Line , was to seize the German forward defensive line . The final objective of the northern flank was the Red Line : taking the highest point on the ridge , the fortified knoll known as the Pimple , the Folie Farm , the <unk> @-@ Stellung trench and the hamlet of Les Tilleuls . The southern two divisions were to achieve two additional objectives : the Blue Line encompassing the town of Thélus and the woods outside the town of Vimy , and the Brown Line , which aimed at capturing the <unk> @-@ <unk> trench and the German second line . The infantry would proceed close behind a creeping barrage placed down by light field guns , advancing in timed 91 @-@ metre ( 100 yd ) increments . The medium and heavy howitzers would establish a series of standing barrages further ahead of the infantry against known defensive systems . 
 The plan called for units to leapfrog over one another , as the advance progressed , to maintain momentum during the attack . The initial wave would capture and consolidate the Black Line and then push forward to the Red Line . The barrage would pause , to enable reserve units to move up , and then move forward with the units pushing beyond the Red Line to the Blue Line . Once the corps secured the Blue Line , advancing units would once again leapfrog established ones and capture the Brown Line . Conducted properly , the plan would leave the German forces little time to exit the security of their deep dugouts and defend their positions against the infantry advance . If the corps maintained its schedule , the troops would advance as much as 3 @,@ 700 m ( 4 @,@ 000 yd ) and have the majority of the ridge under control by 1 : 00 pm of the first day . 
 = = = German defences = = = 
 The experience of the Battle of the Somme led the German command to conclude that the policy of rigidly defending a trench position line was no longer effective against the firepower that the Entente armies had accumulated . Ludendorff published a new defensive doctrine in December 1916 , in which deeper defences were to be built , within which the garrison would have room to manoeuvre , rather than rigidly holding successive lines of trenches . Along Vimy Ridge , the German forces spent two years constructing fortifications designed for rigid defence . Little reconstruction based upon the new defence @-@ in @-@ depth doctrine had been accomplished by April 1917 because the terrain made it impractical . 
 The topography of the Vimy battlefield made defence @-@ in @-@ depth difficult to realize . The ridge was 700 metres ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) wide at its narrowest point , with a steep drop on the eastern side , all but eliminating the possibility of counterattacks if the ridge was captured . The Germans were apprehensive about the inherent weakness of the Vimy Ridge defences . The German defensive scheme was to maintain a front line defence of sufficient strength to defend against an initial assault and move operational reserves forward , before the enemy could consolidate their gains or overrun remaining German positions . As a result , the German defence at Vimy Ridge relied largely on machine guns , which acted as force multipliers for the defending infantry . 
 Three line divisions , with seven infantry regiments between them , were responsible for the immediate defence of the ridge . The paper strength of each division was approximately 15 @,@ 000 men but their actual strengths was significantly fewer . In 1917 , a full @-@ strength German rifle company consisted of 264 men ; at Vimy Ridge , each rifle company contained approximately 150 men . Each German regiment held a zone approximately 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) wide as far back as the rear area . When the Canadian Corps attacked , each German company faced two or more battalions of approximately 1 @,@ 000 men each . Reserve divisions were kept approximately 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) back instead of assembling close behind the second line according the defence @-@ in @-@ depth theory . 
 = = = Artillery = = = 
 The Canadian Corps ' divisional artillery formations , totalling eight field brigades and two heavy artillery groups , were insufficient for the task at hand and were consequently reinforced with outside formations . Four heavy artillery groups , nine artillery field brigades , three divisional artillery groups and the artillery complement of the British 5th Division was attached to the Canadian Corps . In addition , ten heavy artillery groups of the flanking I and XVII Corps were assigned tasks in support of the Canadian Corps . The artillery batteries of I Corps were particularly important because they enfiladed German gun positions behind Vimy Ridge . In total , the British made available to the Canadian Corps twenty @-@ four brigade artillery groups consisting of four hundred and eighty 18 pounder field guns , one hundred thirty @-@ eight 4 @.@ 5 inch howitzers , ninety @-@ six 2 inch trench mortars , twenty @-@ four 9 @.@ 45 inch mortars , supported by 245 corps @-@ level siege guns and heavy mortars . This firepower gave a density of one heavy gun for every 18 metres ( 20 yd ) and one field gun for every 9 @.@ 1 metres ( 10 yd ) of Canadian Corps frontage , representing a considerable average increase , including three times the heavy guns , over the distribution of artillery at the Battle of the Somme a year earlier . 
 Brigadier @-@ General Edward Morrison developed and subsequently issued a 35 page multi @-@ phased fire support plan called Canadian Corps Artillery Instruction No. 1 for the Capture of Vimy Ridge to support the efforts of the infantry . For its operations , the Canadian Corps received three times the artillery normally assigned to a corps for regular operations . To manage the logistics associated with the increased artillery , Royal Artillery staff officer Major Alan Brooke developed coordinated communication and transport plans to work in conjunction with the complex barrage plans . 
 A 1 @.@ 6 million shell allotment allowed the artillery along the Canadian Corps front to maintain a high sustained rate of fire . Improvements in the quality of the shells compared to those used earlier in the war ensured fewer duds . The introduction of the instantaneous No. 106 fuze greatly improved the effectiveness of the artillery since this fuse burst reliably with the slightest of contact , unlike older timed fuses , making it especially effective at cutting barbed wire before the advance . To maintain communications during the battle , particularly with the artillery , field units laid over 1 @,@ 400 kilometres ( 870 mi ) of telegraph and field telephone cabling , normally at a depth of 2 @.@ 1 metres ( 7 ft ) . In addition , the corps conducted coordinated counter @-@ battery initiatives before the battle . The First Army Field Survey Company printed barrage maps for all batteries , produced artillery boards and provided counter @-@ battery support with their flash spotting groups and sound ranging sections . Utilizing flash spotting , sound ranging and aerial reconnaissance from No. 16 Squadron , and No. 1 & 2 Balloon Company of the Royal Flying Corps in the week before the battle , the counter battery artillery under command of Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Andrew McNaughton fired 125 @,@ 900 shells , harassing an estimated 83 % of the German gun positions . 
 = = = Training = = = 
 In February 1917 , the British General Staff released a training pamphlet titled SS 143 Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action , espousing the return to the pre @-@ war emphasis on fire and movement tactics and the use of the platoon as a self @-@ contained tactical unit . The short pamphlet noted the importance of dedicated hand grenade , rifle grenade and machine gun sections in suppressing enemy strong points with an appropriate level of fire to permit other military units to advance . Coupled with the observations and suggestions made by Currie in the report he submitted in January 1917 following the Verdun lectures , the Canadian Corps instilled the tactical change with vigour . The corps instilled the tactical doctrine for small units by assigning objectives down to the platoon level . Assaulting infantry battalions used hills behind the lines as full @-@ scale model representations of the battlefield . Taped lines demarcated German trench lines while officers on horseback carried flags to represent the advancing front of the artillery barrage . 
 Recognizing that the men in leadership positions were likely to be wounded or killed , soldiers learned the jobs of those beside and above them . At the British First Army headquarters , a large @-@ scale plasticine model of the Vimy sector was constructed and used to show commissioned and senior non @-@ commissioned officers the topographical features of the battlefield and details of the German trench system . In addition , upwards of 40 @,@ 000 topographical trench maps were printed and distributed to ensure that even platoon sergeants and section commanders possessed a wider awareness of the battlefield . These measures gave each platoon a clearer picture of how it fitted into the greater battle plan , and in so doing , reduced the command and control problems that plagued First World War combat . 
 = = = Underground operations = = = 
 The Arras – Vimy sector was conducive to tunnel excavation owing to the soft , porous yet extremely stable nature of the chalk underground . Underground warfare had been conducted on the Vimy sector since 1915 . Bavarian engineers had blown twenty mines in the sector by March 1915 . By early 1916 , German miners had gained an advantage over their French counterparts . On their arrival , British tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers began offensive mining against German miners , first stopping the German underground advance and then developing a defensive strategy that prevented the Germans from gaining a tactical advantage through their mining activities . By 1917 , 19 crater groups existed along this section of the Western Front , each with several large craters . 
 In preparation for the assault , British tunnelling companies created extensive underground networks and fortifications . Twelve subways , up to 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 300 yd ) in length , were excavated at a depth of 10 metres ( 33 ft ) and used to connect reserve lines to front lines , permitting soldiers to advance to the front quickly , securely and unseen . Often incorporated into subways were light rail lines , hospitals , command posts , water reservoirs , ammunition stores , mortar and machine gun posts and communication centres . The Germans dug a number of similar tunnels on the Vimy front , to provide covered routes to the front line and protection for headquarters , resting personnel , equipment and ammunition . 
 To protect some advancing troops from German machine @-@ gun fire , as they crossed no man 's land during the attack , eight mines were laid at the end of the subways , to allow troops to move more quickly and safely enter the German trench system , by creating an elongated trench @-@ depth crater that spanned the length of no man 's land . In an effort to destroy some German surface fortifications before the assault , the British tunnelling companies secretly laid 13 large explosive charges under German positions . The Germans conducted counter @-@ mining against the British tunnellers and destroyed a number of British attempts to plant mines under or near their lines . Of the explosive charges laid by the British , three mines were fired before the assault and three mines and two specialized charges were fired at the start of the attack . 
 = = = Trench raiding = = = 
 Trench raiding involved making small @-@ scale surprise attacks on enemy positions , often in the middle of the night for reasons of stealth . All belligerents employed trench raiding as a tactic to harass their enemy and gain intelligence . In the Canadian Corps trench raiding developed into a training and leadership @-@ building mechanism . The size of a raid would normally be anything from a few men to an entire company , or more , depending on the size of the mission . The four months before the April attack saw the Canadian Corps execute no fewer than 55 separate trench raids . Competition between units even developed with units competing for the honour of the greatest number of prisoners captured or most destruction wrought . The policy of aggressive trench raiding was not without its cost . A large @-@ scale trench raid on 13 February 1917 , involving 900 men from the 4th Canadian Division , resulted in 150 casualties . An even more ambitious trench raid on 1 March 1917 , once again by the 4th Canadian Division , failed and resulted in 637 casualties including two battalion commanders and a number of company commanders killed . This experience did not lessen the extent to which the Canadian Corps employed trench raiding with raids being conducted nightly between 20 March and the opening of the offensive on 9 April , resulting in approximately 1 @,@ 400 additional Canadian casualties . The Germans operated an active patrolling policy and although not as large and ambitious as those of the Canadian Corps , they also engaged in trench raiding . As an example , a German trench raid launched by 79 men against the 3rd Canadian Division on 15 March 1917 was successful in capturing prisoners and causing damage . 
 = = = Battle in the air = = = 
 The Royal Flying Corps launched a determined effort to gain air superiority over the battlefield in support of the spring offensive . The Canadians considered activities such as artillery spotting , and photography of opposing trench systems , troop movements and gun emplacements essential to continue their offensive . The Royal Flying Corps deployed 25 squadrons totalling 365 aircraft along the Arras sector , outnumbering the Imperial German Army Air Service by 2 @-@ to @-@ 1 . Byng was given use of No. 2 Squadron , No. 8 ( Naval ) Squadron , No. 25 Squadron , No. 40 Squadron and No. 43 Squadron , with No. 16 Squadron permanently attached to the Canadian Corps and employed exclusively for observation and artillery support . 
 Aerial reconnaissance was often a hazardous task because of a requirement to fly at slow speeds and at low altitudes . The task was made all the more dangerous with the arrival of additional German flying squadrons , including Manfred von Richthofen 's highly experienced and well equipped Jasta 11 , which led to sharp increase in Royal Flying Corps casualties . Although significantly outnumbering the Germans , the Royal Flying Corps lost 131 aircraft during the first week of April alone . Despite the losses suffered by the Royal Flying Corps , the Imperial German Army Air Service failed to prevent the Royal Flying Corps from carrying out its prime objective , namely the continued support of the army throughout the Arras Offensive with up @-@ to @-@ date aerial photographs and reconnaissance information .

 German Sixth Army commander General Ludwig von Falkenhausen was responsible for the Cambrai – Lille sector and commanded 20 divisions , plus reserves . Vimy Ridge itself was principally defended by the ad hoc Gruppe Vimy formation based under I Bavarian Reserve Corps commander General der Infanterie Karl von <unk> . However , a division of Gruppe Souchez , under VIII Reserve Corps General of the Infantry Georg Karl <unk> , was involved in the frontline defence along the northernmost portion of the ridge . 
 Three divisions were ultimately responsible for manning the frontline defences opposite the Canadian Corps . The 16th Bavarian Infantry Division was located opposite the town of Souchez and responsible for the defence of the northernmost section of the ridge . The division was created in January 1917 through the amalgamation of existing Bavarian formations and had so far only opposed the Canadian Corps . The 79th Reserve Division was responsible for the defence of the vast central section including the highest point of the ridge , Hill 145 . The 79th Reserve Division fought for two years on the Eastern Front before being transferred to the Vimy sector at the end of February 1917 . The 1st Bavarian Reserve Division had been in the Arras area since October 1914 and was holding the towns of Thélus , Bailleul and the southern slope of the ridge . 
 Byng commanded four attacking divisions , one division of reserves and numerous support units . He was supported to the north by the 24th British Division of I Corps , which advanced north of the Souchez river and by the advancing XVII Corps to the south . The 4th Canadian Division was responsible for the northern portion of the advance that included the capture of the highest point of the ridge followed by the heavily defended Pimple just west of the town of Givenchy @-@ en @-@ Gohelle . The 3rd Canadian Division was responsible for the narrow central section of the ridge , including the capture of La Folie Farm . The 2nd Canadian Division , which later included an additional brigade from the 5th British Division , was directly south of 3rd Canadian Division and entrusted with the capture of the town of Thélus . The 1st Canadian Division was responsible for the broad southern sector of the corps advance and expected to make the greatest advance in terms of distance . Byng planned for a healthy reserve for contingencies that included the relief of forward troops , help in consolidating positions and aiding the 4th Canadian Division with the capture of the Pimple . As a result , the 9th Canadian Brigade , 15th British Brigade and 95th British Brigade were kept in corps @-@ level reserve .

 German foreign intelligence gathering , large @-@ scale Allied trench raids and observed troop concentrations west of Arras made it clear to the Germans that a spring offensive near Arras was being planned . In February 1917 , a German @-@ born Canadian soldier deserted to the German side and helped confirm many of the suspicions held by the Germans , providing them with a great deal of useful information . By March 1917 , the German forces were aware that a major attack was imminent and would include operations aimed at capturing Vimy Ridge . General of Infantry Ernst August Marx von <unk> , commanding the German 79th Reserve Division , reported in late @-@ March that he believed the Canadian Corps was moving into an echelon formation and were preparing for a major attack . The Germans quickly developed plans to launch a pre @-@ emptive operation , following the adage that the best defence is a good offence , intent on capturing the northern section of the Zouave Valley along the northernmost portion of the Canadian front . Heavy Canadian Corps artillery fire ultimately prevented the Germans from executing their pre @-@ emptive attack . 
 The preliminary phase of the Canadian Corps artillery bombardment began on 20 March 1917 , with a systematic two @-@ week bombardment of German batteries , trenches and strong points . The Canadian Corps paid particular attention to eliminating German barbed wire , a task made easier with the introduction of the No. 106 instantaneous fuse . In addition , only half of the available artillery was committed at any one point in time with the intensity of the barrage expressly varied as to confuse the Germans and preserve some level of secrecy . Phase two lasted the entire week beginning 2 April 1917 and employed the entire artillery arsenal at the disposal of the Canadian Corps , massing the equivalent of one heavy gun for every 18 metres ( 20 yd ) and one field gun for every 9 @.@ 1 metres ( 10 yd ) . The German soldiers came to refer to the week before the attack as ' the week of suffering ' . By the Germans ' own account , their trenches and defensive works were almost completely demolished . Furthermore , German health and morale suffered from the stress of remaining at the ready for eleven straight days under extremely heavy artillery bombardment . Compounding German difficulties was the inability of ration parties to bring food supplies to the front lines . On 3 April , General von Falkenhausen ordered his reserve divisions to prepare to relieve frontline divisions over the course of a long drawn @-@ out defensive battle , in a manner similar to the Battle of the Somme . However , the divisions were kept 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) from the battlefield to avoid being shelled .

 = = = = 9 April = = = = 
 The attack was to begin at 5 : 30 am on Easter Monday , 9 April 1917 . The attack was originally planned for the morning of 8 April ( Easter Sunday ) , but it was postponed for 24 hours at the request of the French . During the late hours of 8 April and early morning of 9 April the men of the leading and supporting wave of the attack were moved into their forward assembly positions . The weather was cold and later changed to sleet and snow . Although physically discomforting for everyone , the north @-@ westerly storm provided some advantage to the assaulting troops by blowing snow in the faces of the defending troops . Light Canadian and British artillery bombardments continued throughout the prior night but stopped in the few minutes before the attack , as the artillery recalibrated their guns in preparation for the synchronized barrage . At exactly 5 : 30 am , every artillery piece at the disposal of the Canadian Corps began firing . Thirty seconds later , engineers detonated the mine charges laid under no man 's land and the German trench line , destroying a number of German strong points and creating secure communication trenches directly across no man 's land . Light field guns laid down a barrage that advanced in predetermined increments , often 100 yards ( 91 m ) every three minutes , while medium and heavy howitzers established a series of standing barrages further ahead , against known defensive systems . During the early fighting the German divisional artilleries , despite heavy losses , were able to maintain their defensive firing . As the Canadian assault advanced , it overran many of the German guns because there was no means of moving them to the rear on account of many of the horses being killed in the initial gas attack . 
 The 1st , 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions reported reaching and capturing their first objective , the Black Line , by 6 : 25 am . The 4th Canadian Division encountered a great deal of trouble during its advance and was unable to complete its first objective until some hours later . After a planned pause , when the 1st , 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions consolidated their positions , the advance resumed . Shortly after 7 : 00 am , the 1st Canadian Division captured the left half of its second objective , the Red Line , and moved the 1st Canadian Brigade forward to mount an attack on the remainder . The 2nd Canadian Division reported reaching the Red Line and capturing the town of Les Tilleuls at approximately the same time . A mine explosion that killed many German troops of the Reserve Infantry Regiment 262 manning the front line preceded the advance of the 3rd Canadian Division . The remaining German troops could do no more than man temporary lines of resistance until later manning a full defence at the German third line . As a result , the southern section of the 3rd Canadian Division was able to reach the Red Line at the western edge of the Bois de la Folie at around 7 : 30 am . At 9 : 00 am the division learned of its exposed left flank , as the 4th Canadian Division had not yet captured Hill 145 . The 3rd Canadian Division was thus called upon to establish a divisional defensive flank to its north . Although the German commanders were able to maintain open lines of communication and issue operating orders , even with swift staff work the tempo of the assault was such that German decision cycle was unable to react decisively . 
 The only portion of the Canadian assault that did not go as planned was the advance of the 4th Canadian Division , collapsing almost immediately after exiting their trenches . The commanding officer of one of the assaulting battalions requested that the artillery leave a portion of German trench undamaged . Machine @-@ gun nests in the undamaged sections of the German line pinned down , wounded or killed much of the 4th Canadian Division 's right flank . The progress on the left flank was eventually impeded by harassing fire from the Pimple that was made worse when the creeping barrage got too far ahead of the advancing troops . In view of the German defence , the 4th Canadian Division did not attempt a further frontal assault throughout the afternoon . Reserve units from the 4th Canadian Division came forward and once again attacked the German positions on the top of the ridge . Persistent attacks eventually forced the German troops holding the south @-@ western portion of Hill 145 to withdraw , but only after they had run out of ammunition , mortar rounds and grenades . 
 Towards midday , the 79th Reserve Division was ordered to recapture the portions of its third line lost during the progression of the Canadian attack . However , it was not until 6 : 00 pm that the force was able to organize and counterattack , clearing the Canadian Corps troops out of the ruined village of Vimy , but not recapturing the third line south of the village . By night time , the German forces holding the top of the ridge believed they had overcome the immediate crisis for the mean time . Additional German reinforcements began arriving and by late evening portions of the 111th Infantry Division occupied the third line near <unk> and Arleux , with the remainder of the division arriving the following day . 
 = = = = 10 April = = = = 
 The British moved three fresh brigades up to the Red Line by 9 : 30 am on 10 April to support the advance of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Division , whereupon they were to leapfrog existing units occupying the Red line and advance to the Blue Line . Fresh units including two sections of tanks and the 13th British Brigade were called up from reserve to support the advance of the 2nd Canadian Division . By approximately 11 : 00 am , the Blue Line , including Hill 135 and the town of Thélus , had been captured . To permit the troops time to consolidate the Blue Line , the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward . Shortly before 1 : 00 pm , the advance recommenced with both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reporting their final objective . The tank supported advance via <unk> , and directed at the rear of the 79th Reserve Division , was eventually halted by concentrated German fire short of the village . The Canadian 1st and 2nd Divisions were nonetheless able to secure the Brown Line by approximately 2 : 00 pm . 
 The 4th Canadian Division had made an attempt to capture the northern half of Hill 145 at around 3 : 15 pm , briefly capturing the peak before a German counterattack retook the position . The Germans occupying the small salient on ridge soon found themselves being attacked along their flanks by continuously reinforced Canadian Corps troops . When it became obvious that the position was completely outflanked and there was no prospect of reinforcement , the German troops pulled back . The German forces were evacuated off the ridge with German artillery batteries moved west of the Vimy – Bailleul railway embankment or to the Oppy – Méricourt line . By nightfall of 10 April , the only Canadian objective not yet achieved was the capture of the Pimple . 
 = = = = 12 April = = = = 
 The 4th Canadian Division faced difficulties at the start of the battle that forced it to delay its assault on the Pimple until 12 April . The Pimple was initially defended by the 16th Bavarian Infantry Division , but the Canadian Corps ' preliminary artillery bombardment leading up to the assault on 9 April caused heavy casualties amongst its ranks . On 11 April , the 4th Guards Infantry Division first reinforced and then relieved affected 16th Bavarian Infantry Division units . The night before the attack , artillery harassed German positions while a gas section of Royal Engineers , employing Livens Projectors , fired more than 40 drums of gas directly into the town of Givenchy @-@ en @-@ Gohelle to cause confusion . The defending German troops managed to drive back the initial Canadian assaults at around 4 : 00 am using small arms fire . The 10th Canadian Brigade attacked once again at 5 : 00 am , this time supported by a significant amount of artillery and the 24th British Division of I Corps to the north . The German defensive artillery fire was late and too light to cause the assaulting troops great difficulty , allowing the Canadian Corps to exploit wide gaps and break into the German positions . The 10th Canadian Brigade , assisted by snow and a westerly wind , fought hastily entrained German troops to capture the entire Pimple by 6 : 00 pm .

 By nightfall on 12 April 1917 , the Canadian Corps was in firm control of the ridge . The corps suffered 10 @,@ 602 casualties : 3 @,@ 598 killed and 7 @,@ 004 wounded . The German Sixth Army suffered an unknown number of casualties with approximately 4 @,@ 000 men becoming prisoners of war . Four members of the Canadian Corps received Victoria Crosses , the highest military decoration awarded to British and Commonwealth forces for valour , for their actions during the battle : 
 Private William Johnstone Milne of the 16th ( Canadian Scottish ) Battalion . 
 Lance @-@ Sergeant Ellis <unk> Sifton of the 18th ( Western Ontario ) Battalion . 
 Private John George Pattison of the 50th ( Calgary ) Battalion . 
 Captain Thain Wendell MacDowell of the 38th ( Ottawa ) Battalion . 
 At least two Orders Pour le Mérite , the Kingdom of Prussia 's highest military order , were awarded to German commanders for their actions during the battle : 
 Oberstleutnant Wilhelm von <unk> commander of the 261st Prussian Reserve Infantry Regiment , of the German 79th Reserve Division . 
 General of the Infantry Georg Karl <unk> commander of the VIII Reserve Corps and Gruppe Souchez . 
 Following the defeat , the Chief of the German General Staff , Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg , ordered the Supreme Army Command to conduct a court of enquiry into the defensive collapse of the Arras sector . The court concluded that the Sixth Army headquarters had disregarded frontline commander reports , noting a possible imminent attack , and as a result , reserve units were kept too far back to execute a timely and effective counterattack . The court concluded that Sixth Army commander General Ludwig von Falkenhausen failed to apply an elastic defence properly as espoused by German defensive doctrine of the time . Instead , the defensive system was a series of unmoving strong points and static lines of resistance , which the Canadian artillery ultimately isolated and destroyed . As a result of the inquiry , Hindenburg removed Falkenhausen from his command and transferred him to Belgium where he served the remainder of the war as that country 's Governor General . 
 The Germans did not see the Canadian Corps 's capture of Vimy Ridge as a loss . Contemporary German sources viewed the action , at worst , as a draw , given that no full @-@ scale breakthrough occurred following the attack . The Germans did not attempt to recapture the ridge , even during the Spring Offensive , and it remained under British control until the end of the war . 
 The loss of Vimy Ridge forced the Germans to reassess their defensive strategy in the area . Instead of mounting a counterattack , they pursued a scorched earth policy , and retreated to the Oppy – Méricourt line . The complete failure of the French Nivelle Offensive in the week after the Arras Offensive placed pressure on Field Marshal Douglas Haig to keep the Germans occupied in the Arras sector to minimize French losses . The Canadian Corps participated in several of these actions including the Battle of Arleux and the Third Battle of the Scarpe in late April and early May 1917 . 
 After the end of World War I , Julian Byng was raised to the peerage as Baron Byng of Vimy , of Thorpe @-@ le @-@ Soken in the County of Essex , on 7 October 1919 . The next month , he retired from the military and moved to Thorpe Hall .

 The Battle of Vimy Ridge has considerable significance for Canada . 
 Although the battle is not generally considered the greatest achievement of the Canadian Corps in strategic importance or results obtained , it was the first instance in which all four Canadian divisions , made up of troops drawn from all parts of the country , fought as a cohesive formation . The image of national unity and achievement is what initially gave the battle importance for Canada . According to Pierce , " The historical reality of the battle has been reworked and reinterpreted in a conscious attempt to give purpose and meaning to an event that came to symbolize Canada 's coming of age as a nation . " The idea that Canada 's national identity and nationhood were born out of the battle is an opinion that is widely held in military and general histories of Canada . 
 = = = Vimy Memorial = = = 
 The Canadian National Vimy Memorial is Canada 's largest and principal overseas war memorial . Located on the highest point of the Vimy Ridge , the memorial is dedicated to the commemoration of the Battle of Vimy Ridge and Canadian Expeditionary Force members killed during the First World War . It serves as the place of commemoration for Canadian soldiers killed in France during the First World War with no known grave . France granted Canada perpetual use of a section of land at Vimy Ridge in 1922 for the purpose of a battlefield park and memorial . A 100 @-@ hectare ( 250 @-@ acre ) portion of the former battlefield is preserved as part of the memorial park that surrounds the monument . The grounds of the site are still honeycombed with wartime tunnels , trenches , craters and unexploded munitions , and are largely closed off for public safety . A section of preserved trenches and a portion of a tunnel have been made accessible to site visitors . 
 The memorial took eleven years and $ 1 @.@ 5 million ( $ 20 @.@ 9 million in present terms ) to build and was unveiled on 26 July 1936 by King Edward VIII , in the presence of President Albert Lebrun of France and 50 @,@ 000 or more Canadian and French veterans and their families . Starting in 2004 , the monument underwent a major multi @-@ year restoration project , which included general cleaning and the <unk> of many inscribed names . Queen Elizabeth II rededicated the restored monument on 9 April 2007 during a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle . Veterans Affairs Canada maintains the memorial site . 
 = Haumea = 
 Haumea , minor @-@ planet designation 136108 Haumea , is a dwarf planet located beyond Neptune 's orbit . It was discovered in 2004 by a team headed by Mike Brown of Caltech at the Palomar Observatory in the United States and independently in 2005 , by a team headed by José Luis Ortiz Moreno at the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain , though the latter claim has been contested . On September 17 , 2008 , it was recognized as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) and named after Haumea , the Hawaiian goddess of childbirth . 
 Haumea 's mass is about one @-@ third that of Pluto , and 1 / 1400 that of Earth . Although its shape has not been directly observed , calculations from its light curve indicate that it is a triaxial ellipsoid , with its major axis twice as long as its minor . Its gravity is thought to be sufficient for it to have relaxed into hydrostatic equilibrium , making it a dwarf planet . Haumea 's elongated shape together with its rapid rotation , high density , and high albedo ( from a surface of crystalline water ice ) , are thought to be the consequences of a giant collision , which left Haumea the largest member of a collisional family that includes several large trans @-@ Neptunian objects ( TNOs ) and Haumea 's two known moons , Hiʻiaka and Namaka . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 Two teams claim credit for the discovery of Haumea . Mike Brown and his team at Caltech discovered Haumea in December 2004 on images they had taken on May 6 , 2004 . On July 20 , 2005 , they published an online abstract of a report intended to announce the discovery at a conference in September 2005 . At around this time , José Luis Ortiz Moreno and his team at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía at Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain found Haumea on images taken on March 7 – 10 , 2003 . Ortiz emailed the Minor Planet Center with their discovery on the night of July 27 , 2005 . 
 Brown initially conceded discovery credit to Ortiz , but came to suspect the Spanish team of fraud upon learning that his observation logs were accessed from the Spanish observatory the day before the discovery announcement . These logs included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to <unk> Haumea in their 2003 images , and they were accessed again just before Ortiz scheduled telescope time to obtain confirmation images for a second announcement to the MPC on July 29 . Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing , stating he was merely verifying whether they had discovered a new object . 
 IAU protocol is that discovery credit for a minor planet goes to whoever first submits a report to the MPC ( Minor Planet Center ) with enough positional data for a decent determination of its orbit , and that the credited discoverer has priority in choosing a name . However , the IAU announcement on September 17 , 2008 , that Haumea had been accepted as a dwarf planet , did not mention a discoverer . The location of discovery was listed as the Sierra Nevada Observatory of the Spanish team , but the chosen name , Haumea , was the Caltech proposal ; Ortiz 's team had proposed " Ataecina " , named for the ancient Iberian goddess of Spring . 
 = = = Name = = = 
 Until it was given a permanent name , the Caltech discovery team used the nickname " Santa " among themselves , because they had discovered Haumea on December 28 , 2004 , just after Christmas . The Spanish team were the first to file a claim for discovery to the Minor Planet Center , in July 2005 . On July 29 , 2005 , Haumea was given the provisional designation 2003 EL61 , based on the date of the Spanish discovery image . On September 7 , 2006 , it was numbered and admitted into the official minor planet catalogue as ( 136108 ) 2003 EL61 . 
 Following guidelines established by the IAU that classical Kuiper belt objects be given names of mythological beings associated with creation , in September 2006 the Caltech team submitted formal names from Hawaiian mythology to the IAU for both ( 136108 ) 2003 EL61 and its moons , in order " to pay homage to the place where the satellites were discovered " . The names were proposed by David Rabinowitz of the Caltech team . Haumea is the matron goddess of the island of Hawaiʻi , where the Mauna Kea Observatory is located . In addition , she is identified with Papa , the goddess of the earth and wife of Wākea ( space ) , which is appropriate because Haumea is thought to be composed almost entirely of solid rock , without the thick ice mantle over a small rocky core typical of other known Kuiper belt objects . Lastly , Haumea is the goddess of fertility and childbirth , with many children who sprang from different parts of her body ; this corresponds to the swarm of icy bodies thought to have broken off the dwarf planet during an ancient collision . The two known moons , also believed to have formed in this manner , are thus named after two of Haumea 's daughters , Hiʻiaka and Nāmaka . 
 The proposal by the Ortiz team , Ataecina , did not meet IAU naming requirements , because Ataecina is not a creation deity . ( See Ataecina § Dwarf planet . ) 
 = = Classification = = 
 Haumea is a plutoid , a dwarf planet beyond Neptune 's orbit . Its classification as a dwarf planet means it is presumed to be massive enough to have been rounded by its own gravity into a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium , but not massive enough to have cleared its neighbourhood of similar objects . Haumea appears to have a triaxial ellipsoid shape resulting its rapid rotation complicated by tidal interactions with its moons . This contrasts with the simpler oblate shape typically assumed by less rapidly rotating astronomical bodies such as the Earth , Jupiter ( or a water balloon tossed with moderate spin ) . Like the earth , Haumea is flattened at the poles ( indeed much more so ) , but its equator , instead of being round like the Earth 's , is elliptical , with two big bulges 180 degrees apart in longitude , buoyed up , as it were , by the greater centrifugal force they experience by virtue of being farther from the axis of rotation . In other words , Haumea is spinning so fast that if it spun much faster these bulges would distort into a dumbbell shape and split the planet in two . Haumea was initially listed as a classical Kuiper belt object in 2006 by the Minor Planet Center , but no longer . The nominal trajectory suggests that it is in the weak 7 : 12 resonance with Neptune ( orbiting the Sun 7 times for every 12 orbits of Neptune ) , because its perihelion distance of 35 AU is near the limit of stability with Neptune . There are precovery images of Haumea dating back to March 22 , 1955 from the Palomar Mountain Digitized Sky Survey . Further observations of the orbit will be required to verify its dynamic status . 
 = = Orbit and rotation = = 
 Haumea has an orbital period of 284 Earth years , a perihelion of 35 AU , and an orbital inclination of 28 ° . It passed aphelion in early 1992 , and is currently more than 50 AU from the Sun . Haumea 's orbit has a slightly greater eccentricity than that of the other members of its collisional family . This is thought to be due to Haumea 's weak 7 : 12 orbital resonance with Neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit over the course of a billion years , through the Kozai effect , which allows the exchange of an orbit 's inclination for increased eccentricity . 
 With a visual magnitude of 17 @.@ 3 , Haumea is the third @-@ brightest object in the Kuiper belt after Pluto and Makemake , and easily observable with a large amateur telescope . However , because the planets and most small Solar System bodies share a common orbital alignment from their formation in the primordial disk of the Solar System , most early surveys for distant objects focused on the projection on the sky of this common plane , called the ecliptic . As the region of sky close to the ecliptic became well explored , later sky surveys began looking for objects that had been dynamically excited into orbits with higher inclinations , as well as more distant objects , with slower mean motions across the sky . These surveys eventually covered the location of Haumea , with its high orbital inclination and current position far from the ecliptic . 
 Haumea displays large fluctuations in brightness over a period of 3 @.@ 9 hours , which can only be explained by a rotational period of this length . This is faster than any other known equilibrium body in the Solar System , and indeed faster than any other known body larger than 100 km in diameter . This rapid rotation is thought to have been caused by the impact that created its satellites and collisional family . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 Because Haumea has moons , the mass of the system can be calculated from their orbits using Kepler 's third law . The result is 4 @.@ 2 × 1021 kg , 28 % the mass of the Plutonian system and 6 % that of the Moon . Nearly all of this mass is in Haumea . 
 = = = Size , shape , and composition = = = 
 The size of a Solar System object can be deduced from its optical magnitude , its distance , and its albedo . Objects appear bright to Earth observers either because they are large or because they are highly reflective . If their reflectivity ( albedo ) can be ascertained , then a rough estimate can be made of their size . For most distant objects , the albedo is unknown , but Haumea is large and bright enough for its thermal emission to be measured , which has given an approximate value for its albedo and thus its size . However , the calculation of its dimensions is complicated by its rapid rotation . The rotational physics of deformable bodies predicts that over as little as a hundred days , a body rotating as rapidly as Haumea will have been distorted into the equilibrium form of a triaxial ellipsoid . It is thought that most of the fluctuation in Haumea 's brightness is caused not by local differences in albedo but by the alternation of the side view and end view as seen from Earth . 
 The rotation and amplitude of Haumea 's light curve place strong constraints on its composition . If Haumea had a low density like Pluto , with a thick mantle of ice over a small rocky core , its rapid rotation would have elongated it to a greater extent than the fluctuations in its brightness allow . Such considerations constrain its density to a range of 2 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 3 g / cm3 . By comparison , the Moon , which is rocky , has a density of 3 @.@ 3 g / cm3 , whereas Pluto , which is typical of icy objects in the Kuiper belt , has a density of 1 @.@ 86 g / cm3 . Haumea 's possible density covers the values for silicate minerals such as olivine and pyroxene , which make up many of the rocky objects in the Solar System . This suggests that the bulk of Haumea is rock covered with a relatively thin layer of ice . A thick ice mantle more typical of Kuiper belt objects may have been blasted off during the impact that formed the Haumean collisional family . 
 The denser the object in hydrostatic equilibrium , the more spherical it must be for a given rotational period , placing constraints on Haumea 's possible dimensions . Fitting its accurately known mass , its rotation , and its inferred density to an equilibrium ellipsoid predicts that Haumea is approximately the diameter of Pluto along its longest axis and about half that at its poles . Because no observations of occultations of stars by Haumea or occultations of the dwarf planet with its moons have yet been made , direct , precise measurements of its dimensions , like those that were made for Pluto , do not yet exist . 
 Several ellipsoid @-@ model calculations of Haumea 's dimensions have been made . The first model produced after Haumea 's discovery was calculated from ground @-@ based observations of Haumea 's light curve at optical wavelengths : it provided a total length of 1 @,@ 960 to 2 @,@ 500 km and a visual albedo ( <unk> ) greater than 0 @.@ 6 . The most likely shape is a triaxial ellipsoid with approximate dimensions of 2 @,@ 000 x 1 @,@ 500 x 1 @,@ 000 km , with an albedo of 0 @.@ 71 . Observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope give a diameter of 1 @,@ 150 + 250 
 − 100 km and an albedo of 0 @.@ 84 + 0 @.@ 1 
 − 0 @.@ 2 , from photometry at infrared wavelengths of 70 μm . Subsequent light @-@ curve analyses have suggested an equivalent circular diameter of 1 @,@ 450 km . In 2010 an analysis of measurements taken by Herschel Space Telescope together with the older Spitzer Telescope measurements yielded a new estimate of the equivalent diameter of Haumea — about 1300 km . These independent size estimates overlap at an average geometric mean diameter of roughly 1 @,@ 400 km . This makes Haumea one of the largest trans @-@ Neptunian objects discovered , smaller than Eris , Pluto , probably Makemake , and possibly 2007 OR10 , and larger than Sedna , Quaoar , and Orcus . 
 = = = Surface = = = 
 In 2005 , the Gemini and Keck telescopes obtained spectra of Haumea which showed strong crystalline water ice features similar to the surface of Pluto 's moon Charon . This is peculiar , because crystalline ice forms at temperatures above 110 K , whereas Haumea 's surface temperature is below 50 K , a temperature at which amorphous ice is formed . In addition , the structure of crystalline ice is unstable under the constant rain of cosmic rays and energetic particles from the Sun that strike trans @-@ Neptunian objects . The timescale for the crystalline ice to revert to amorphous ice under this bombardment is on the order of ten million years , yet trans @-@ Neptunian objects have been in their present cold @-@ temperature locations for timescales of billions of years . Radiation damage should also redden and darken the surface of trans @-@ Neptunian objects where the common surface materials of organic ices and tholin @-@ like compounds are present , as is the case with Pluto . Therefore , the spectra and colour suggest Haumea and its family members have undergone recent resurfacing that produced fresh ice . However , no plausible resurfacing mechanism has been suggested . 
 Haumea is as bright as snow , with an albedo in the range of 0 @.@ 6 – 0 @.@ 8 , consistent with crystalline ice . Other large TNOs such as Eris appear to have albedos as high or higher . Best @-@ fit modeling of the surface spectra suggested that 66 % to 80 % of the Haumean surface appears to be pure crystalline water ice , with one contributor to the high albedo possibly hydrogen cyanide or phyllosilicate clays . Inorganic cyanide salts such as copper potassium cyanide may also be present . 
 However , further studies of the visible and near infrared spectra suggest a homogeneous surface covered by an intimate 1 : 1 mixture of amorphous and crystalline ice , together with no more than 8 % organics . The absence of ammonia hydrate excludes cryovolcanism and the observations confirm that the collisional event must have happened more than 100 million years ago , in agreement with the dynamic studies . The absence of measurable methane in the spectra of Haumea is consistent with a warm collisional history that would have removed such volatiles , in contrast to Makemake . 
 In addition to the large fluctuations in Haumea 's light curve due to the body 's shape , which affect all colours equally , smaller independent colour variations seen in both visible and near @-@ infrared wavelengths show a region on the surface that differs both in colour and in albedo . More specifically , a large dark red area on Haumea 's bright white surface was seen in September 2009 , possibly an impact feature , which indicates an area rich in minerals and organic ( carbon @-@ rich ) compounds , or possibly a higher proportion of crystalline ice . Thus Haumea may have a mottled surface reminiscent of Pluto , if not as extreme . 
 = = Moons = = 
 Two small satellites have been discovered orbiting Haumea , ( 136108 ) Haumea I Hiʻiaka and ( 136108 ) Haumea II Namaka . Brown 's team discovered both in 2005 , through observations of Haumea using the W.M. Keck Observatory . 
 Hiʻiaka , at first nicknamed " Rudolph " by the Caltech team , was discovered January 26 , 2005 . It is the outer and , at roughly 310 km in diameter , the larger and brighter of the two , and orbits Haumea in a nearly circular path every 49 days . Strong absorption features at 1 @.@ 5 and 2 micrometres in the infrared spectrum are consistent with nearly pure crystalline water ice covering much of the surface . The unusual spectrum , along with similar absorption lines on Haumea , led Brown and colleagues to conclude that capture was an unlikely model for the system 's formation , and that the Haumean moons must be fragments of Haumea itself . 
 Namaka , the smaller , inner satellite of Haumea , was discovered on June 30 , 2005 , and nicknamed " Blitzen " . It is a tenth the mass of Hiʻiaka , orbits Haumea in 18 days in a highly elliptical , non @-@ Keplerian orbit , and as of 2008 is inclined 13 ° from the larger moon , which perturbs its orbit . The relatively large eccentricities together with the mutual inclination of the orbits of the satellites are unexpected as they should have been damped by the tidal effects . A relatively recent passage by a 3 : 1 resonance might explain the current excited orbits of the Haumean moons . 
 At present , the orbits of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge @-@ on from Earth , with Namaka periodically occulting Haumea . Observation of such transits would provide precise information on the size and shape of Haumea and its moons , as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon . The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations will require at least a medium @-@ aperture professional telescope for detection . Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999 , a few years before discovery , and will not do so again for some 130 years . However , in a situation unique among regular satellites , Namaka 's orbit is being greatly torqued by Hiʻiaka , preserving the viewing angle of Namaka – Haumea transits for several more years .

 Haumea is the largest member of its collisional family , a group of astronomical objects with similar physical and orbital characteristics thought to have formed when a larger progenitor was shattered by an impact . This family is the first to be identified among TNOs and includes — beside Haumea and its moons — ( <unk> ) 2002 <unk> ( ≈ 364 km ) , ( <unk> ) 1995 <unk> ( ≈ 174 km ) , ( <unk> ) 1996 <unk> ( ≈ 200 km ) , ( <unk> ) 2003 <unk> ( ≈ 230 km ) , and ( <unk> ) 2005 <unk> ( ≈ 252 km ) . Brown and colleagues proposed that the family were a direct product of the impact that removed Haumea 's ice mantle , but a second proposal suggests a more complicated origin : that the material ejected in the initial collision instead coalesced into a large moon of Haumea , which was later shattered in a second collision , dispersing its shards outwards . This second scenario appears to produce a dispersion of velocities for the fragments that is more closely matched to the measured velocity dispersion of the family members . 
 The presence of the collisional family could imply that Haumea and its " offspring " might have originated in the scattered disc . In today 's sparsely populated Kuiper belt , the chance of such a collision occurring over the age of the Solar System is less than 0 @.@ 1 percent . The family could not have formed in the denser primordial Kuiper belt because such a close @-@ knit group would have been disrupted by Neptune 's migration into the belt — the believed cause of the belt 's current low density . Therefore , it appears likely that the dynamic scattered disc region , in which the possibility of such a collision is far higher , is the place of origin for the object that generated Haumea and its kin . 
 Because it would have taken at least a billion years for the group to have diffused as far as it has , the collision which created the Haumea family is believed to have occurred very early in the Solar System 's history .

 = An Inconvenient Truth = 
 An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 documentary film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore 's campaign to educate citizens about global warming via a comprehensive slide show that , by his own estimate made in the film , he has given more than a thousand times . 
 Premiering at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and opening in New York City and Los Angeles on May 24 , 2006 , the documentary was a critical and box @-@ office success , winning two Academy Awards for Best Documentary Feature and Best Original Song . The film grossed $ 24 million in the U.S. and $ 26 million in the foreign box office , becoming the tenth highest grossing documentary film to date in the United States . 
 The idea to document his efforts came from producer Laurie David who saw his presentation at a town @-@ hall meeting on global warming which coincided with the opening of The Day After Tomorrow . Laurie David was so inspired by Gore 's slide show that she , with producer Lawrence Bender , met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film . 
 Since the film 's release , An Inconvenient Truth has been credited for raising international public awareness of global warming and <unk> the environmental movement . The documentary has also been included in science curricula in schools around the world , which has spurred some controversy . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 An Inconvenient Truth presents in film form an illustrated talk on climate by Al Gore , aimed at alerting the public to an increasing " planetary emergency " due to global warming , and shows re @-@ enacted incidents from his life story which influenced his concerns about environmental issues . He began making these presentations in 1989 with flip chart illustrations , the film version uses a Keynote presentation , which Gore refers to as " the slide show " . 
 The former vice president opens the film by greeting an audience with his well known line about his campaign in 2000 : " I am Al Gore ; I used to be the next President of the United States . " He is shown using his laptop to edit his presentation , and pondering the difficulty he has had in awakening public concern : " I 've been trying to tell this story for a long time and I feel as if I 've failed to get the message across . " 
 Gore then begins his slide show on Global Warming ; a comprehensive presentation replete with detailed graphs , flow charts and stark visuals . Gore shows off several majestic photographs of the Earth taken from multiple space missions , Earthrise and The Blue Marble . Gore notes that these photos dramatically transformed the way we see the Earth , helping spark modern environmentalism . 
 Following this , Gore shares anecdotes that inspired his interest in the issue , including his college education with early climate expert Roger Revelle at Harvard University , his sister 's death from lung cancer and his young son 's near @-@ fatal car accident . Gore recalls a story from his grade @-@ school years , where a fellow student asked his geography teacher about continental drift ; in response , the teacher called the concept the " most ridiculous thing [ he 'd ] ever heard . " Gore ties this conclusion to the assumption that " the Earth is so big , we can 't possibly have any lasting , harmful impact on the Earth 's environment . " For comic effect , Gore uses a clip from the Futurama episode " Crimes of the Hot " to describe the greenhouse effect . Gore refers to his loss to George W. Bush in the 2000 United States presidential election as a " hard blow " yet one which subsequently " brought into clear focus , the mission [ he ] had been pursuing for all these years . " 
 Throughout the movie , Gore discusses the scientific opinion on global warming , as well as the present and future effects of global warming and stresses that global warming " is really not a political issue , so much as a moral one , " describing the consequences he believes global warming will produce if the amount of human @-@ generated greenhouse gases is not significantly reduced in the very near future . Gore also presents Antarctic ice coring data showing CO2 levels higher now than in the past 650 @,@ 000 years . 
 The film includes segments intended to refute critics who say that global warming is unproven or that warming will be insignificant . For example , Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica , either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet , flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees . Melt water from Greenland , because of its lower salinity , could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there . It also contains various short animated projections of what could happen to different animals more vulnerable to global warming 
 The documentary ends with Gore arguing that if appropriate actions are taken soon , the effects of global warming can be successfully reversed by releasing less CO2 and planting more vegetation to consume existing CO2 . Gore calls upon his viewers to learn how they can help him in these efforts . Gore concludes the film by saying : 
 " Each one of us is a cause of global warming , but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we buy , the electricity we use , the cars we drive ; we can make choices to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero . The solutions are in our hands , we just have to have the determination to make it happen . We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions , everything but political will . But in America , the will to act is a renewable resource . " 
 During the film 's end credits , a <unk> pops up on screen suggesting to viewers things at home they can do to combat global warming , including " recycle " , " speak up in your community " , " try to buy a hybrid vehicle " and " encourage everyone you know to watch this movie . " 
 Gore 's book of the same title was published concurrently with the theatrical release of the documentary . The book contains additional information , scientific analysis , and Gore 's commentary on the issues presented in the documentary . A 2007 documentary entitled An Update with Former Vice President Al Gore features Gore discussing additional information that came to light after the film was completed , such as Hurricane Katrina , coral reef depletion , glacial earthquake activity on the Greenland ice sheet , wildfires , and trapped methane gas release associated with permafrost melting .

 = = = Origins = = = 
 Gore became interested in global warming when he took a course at Harvard University with Professor Roger Revelle , one of the first scientists to measure carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . Later , when Gore was in Congress , he initiated the first congressional hearing on the subject in 1981 . Gore 's 1992 book , Earth in the Balance , dealing with a number of environmental topics , reached the New York Times bestseller list . 
 As Vice President during the Clinton Administration , Gore pushed for the implementation of a carbon tax to encourage energy efficiency and diversify the choices of fuel better reflecting the true environmental costs of energy use ; it was partially implemented in 1993 . He helped broker the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , an international treaty designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions . The treaty was not ratified in the United States after a 95 to 0 vote in the Senate . The primary objections stemmed from the exemptions the treaty gave to China and India , whose industrial base and carbon footprint have grown rapidly , and fears that the exemptions would lead to further trade imbalances and offshoring arrangement with those countries . 
 Gore also supported the funding of the controversial , and much @-@ delayed satellite called Triana , which would have provided an image of the Earth 24 hours a day , over the internet and would have acted as a barometer measuring the process of global warming . During his 2000 presidential campaign , Gore ran , in part , on a pledge to ratify the Kyoto Protocol . 
 = = = The slide show = = = 
 After his defeat in the 2000 presidential election by George W. Bush , Gore returned his focus to the topic . He edited and adapted a slide show he had compiled years earlier , and began featuring the slide show in presentations on global warming across the U.S. and around the world . At the time of the film , Gore estimated he had shown the presentation more than one thousand times . 
 Producer Laurie David saw Gore 's slide show in New York City at a global warming town @-@ hall meeting after the May 27 , 2004 premiere of The Day After Tomorrow . Gore was one of several panelists and he showed a ten @-@ minute version of his slide show . 
 I had never seen it before , and I was floored . As soon as the evening 's program concluded , I asked him to let me present his full briefing to leaders and friends in New York and Los Angeles . I would do all the organizing if he would commit to the dates . Gore 's presentation was the most powerful and clear explanation of global warming I had ever seen . And it became my mission to get everyone I knew to see it too . 
 Inspired , David assembled a team , including producer Lawrence Bender and former president of eBay Jeffrey Skoll , who met with Gore about the possibility of making the slide show into a movie . It took some convincing . The slide show , she says , " was his baby , and he felt proprietary about it and it was hard for him to let go . " 
 David said the box office returns weren 't important to her . " None of us are going to make a dime . " What is at stake , she says , " is , you know , the planet . " 
 David and Bender later met with director Davis Guggenheim , to have him direct the film adaptation of his slide show . Guggenheim , who was skeptical at first , later saw the presentation for himself , stating that he was " blown away , " and " left after an hour and a half thinking that global warming [ was ] the most important issue ... I had no idea how you ’ d make a film out of it , but I wanted to try , " he said . 
 In 2004 Gore enlisted Duarte Design to condense and update his material and add video and animation . Ted Boda described the tools that went into designing the project : " Gore 's presentation was in fact using Apple 's Keynote presentation software ( the same software Steve Jobs presents from ) and did so for a number of reasons . As a designer for the presentation , Keynote was the first choice to help create such an engaging presentation . " 
 Initially reluctant of the film adaptation , Gore said after he and the crew were into the production of the movie , the director , Guggenheim , earned his trust . 
 I had seen enough to gain a tremendous respect for his skill and sensitivity . And he said that one of the huge differences between a live stage performance and a movie is that when you 're in the same room with a live person who 's on stage speaking – even if it 's me – there 's an element of dramatic tension and human connection that keeps your attention . And in a movie , that element is just not present . He explained to me that you have to create that element on screen , by supplying a narrative thread that allows the audience to make a connection with one or more characters . He said , " You 've got to be that character . " So we talked about it , and as I say , by then he had earned such a high level of trust from me that he convinced me . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 When Bender first saw Gore 's visual presentation he had concerns about connection with viewers , citing a " need to find a personal way in . " In the string of interviews with Gore that followed , Gore himself felt like they " were making Kill Al Vol . 3 " . Bender had other issues including a time frame that was " grueling " and needed to be done in " a very short period of time " despite many filming locations planned . These included many locations throughout the United States and also included China . " It was a lot of travel in a very short period of time . And they had to get this thing edited and cut starting in January , and ready to screen in May . That ’ s like a seriously tight schedule . So the logistics of pulling it off with a low budget were really difficult , and if there ’ s one person who gets credit , it ’ s Leslie Chilcott , because she really pulled it together . "

 The majority of the movie exhibits Gore delivering his lecture to an audience at a relatively small theater in Los Angeles . Gore 's presentation was delivered on a 70 @-@ foot digital screen that Bender commissioned specifically for the movie . 
 While the bulk of the film was shot on 4 : 4 : 4 HDCAM , according to director Guggenheim , a vast array of different film formats were used : " There ’ s 35mm and 16mm . A lot of the stuff on the farm I just shot myself on 8mm film . We used four Sony F950 <unk> for the presentation . We shot three different kinds of <unk> HD , both 30 and 24 . There ’ s <unk> , there ’ s 3200 black @-@ and @-@ white stills , there ’ s digital stills , some of them emailed on the day they were taken from as far off as Greenland . There was three or four different types of animation . One of the animators is from New Zealand and emailed me his work . There ’ s JPEG stuff . " 
 Guggenheim says while it would 've been a lot easier to use one format , it would not have had the same impact . " Each format has its own feel and texture and touch . For the storytelling of what Gore ’ s memory was like of growing up on the farm , some of this 8mm stuff that I shot is very impressionistic . And for some of his memories of his son ’ s accident , these grainy black @-@ and @-@ white stills ... have a feel that contrasted very beautifully with the crisp hi @-@ def HD that we shot . Every format was used to its best potential . Some of the footage of Katrina has this blown @-@ out video , where the chroma is just blasted , and it looks real muddy , but that too has its own kind of powerful , impactful feeling . " 
 = = Scientific basis = = 
 The film 's thesis is that global warming is real , potentially catastrophic , and human @-@ caused . Gore presents specific data that supports the thesis , including : 
 The Keeling curve , measuring CO2 from the Mauna Loa Observatory . 
 The retreat of numerous glaciers is shown in before @-@ and @-@ after photographs . 
 A study by researchers at the Physics Institute at the University of Bern and the European Project for Ice <unk> in Antarctica ( <unk> ) presenting data from Antarctic ice cores showing carbon dioxide concentrations higher than at any time during the past 650 @,@ 000 years . 
 Instrumental temperature record showing that the ten hottest years ever measured in this atmospheric record had all occurred in the previous fourteen years . 
 A 2004 survey , by Naomi Oreskes of 928 peer @-@ reviewed scientific articles on global climate change published between 1993 and 2003 . The survey , published as an editorial in the journal Science , found that every article either supported the human @-@ caused global warming consensus or did not comment on it . Gore also presented a 2004 study by Max and Jules <unk> showing 53 % of articles that appeared in major US newspapers over a fourteen @-@ year period gave roughly equal attention to scientists who expressed views that global warming was caused by humans as they did to global warming " skeptics " ( many of them funded by carbon @-@ based industry interests ) , creating a false balance . 
 The Associated Press contacted more than 100 climate researchers and questioned them about the film 's veracity . All 19 climate scientists who had seen the movie or had read the homonymous book said that Gore accurately conveyed the science , with few errors . 
 William H. Schlesinger , dean of the Nicholas School of Environment and Earth Sciences at Duke University said " [ Gore ] got all the important material and got it right . " Robert Corell , chairman of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment was also impressed . " I sat there and I 'm amazed at how thorough and accurate . After the presentation I said , ' Al , I 'm absolutely blown away . There 's a lot of details you could get wrong . ' ... I could find no error . " Michael Shermer , scientific author and founder of The Skeptics Society , wrote in Scientific American that Gore 's slide show " shocked me out of my doubting stance . " Eric Steig , a climate scientist writing on <unk> , lauded the film 's science as " remarkably up to date , with reference to some of the very latest research . " Ted <unk> , lead scientist from the National Snow and Ice Data Center , said the film " does an excellent job of outlining the science behind global warming and the challenges society faces in the coming century because of it . " 
 One concern among scientists in the film was the connection between hurricanes and global warming , which remains contentious in the science community . Gore cited five recent scientific studies to support his view . " I thought the use of imagery from Hurricane Katrina was inappropriate and unnecessary in this regard , as there are plenty of disturbing impacts associated with global warming for which there is much greater scientific consensus , " said Brian Soden , professor of meteorology and oceanography at the University of Miami . Gavin Schmidt , climate modeler for NASA , thought Gore appropriately addressed the issue . " Gore talked about 2005 and 2004 being very strong seasons , and if you weren 't paying attention , you could be left with the impression that there was a direct cause and effect , but he was very careful to not say there 's a direct correlation , " Schmidt said . " There is a difference between saying ' we are confident that they will increase ' and ' we are confident that they have increased due to this effect , ' " added Steig . " Never in the movie does he say : ' This particular event is caused by global warming . ' " 
 Gore 's use of long ice core records of CO2 and temperature ( from oxygen isotope measurements ) in Antarctic ice cores to illustrate the correlation between the two drew some scrutiny ; Schmidt , Steig and Michael E. Mann back up Gore 's data . " Gore stated that the greenhouse gas levels and temperature changes over ice age signals had a complex relationship but that they ' fit ' . Both of these statements are true , " said Schmidt and Mann . " The complexity though is actually quite fascinating ... a full understanding of why CO2 changes in precisely the pattern that it does during ice ages is elusive , but among the most plausible explanations is that increased received solar radiation in the southern hemisphere due to changes in Earth ’ s orbital geometry warms the southern ocean , releasing CO2 into the atmosphere , which then leads to further warming through an enhanced greenhouse effect . Gore ’ s terse explanation of course does not mention such complexities , but the crux of his point – that the observed long @-@ term relationship between CO2 and temperature in Antarctica supports our understanding of the warming impact of increased CO2 concentrations – is correct . Moreover , our knowledge of why CO2 is changing now ( fossil fuel burning ) is solid . We also know that CO2 is a greenhouse gas , and that the carbon cycle feedback is positive ( increasing temperatures lead to increasing CO2 and CH4 ) , implying that future changes in CO2 will be larger than we might anticipate . " " Gore is careful not to state what the temperature / CO2 scaling is , " said Steig . " He is making a qualitative point , which is entirely accurate . The fact is that it would be difficult or impossible to explain past changes in temperature during the ice age cycles without CO2 changes . In that sense , the ice core CO2 @-@ temperature correlation remains an appropriate demonstration of the influence of CO2 on climate . " 
 Steig disputed Gore 's statement that you can visibly see the effect that the United States Clean Air Act has had on ice cores in Antarctica . " One can neither see , nor even detect using sensitive chemical methods any evidence in Antarctica of the Clean Air Act , " he said , but did note that they are " clearly recorded in ice core records from Greenland . " Despite these flaws , Steig said that the film got the fundamental science right and the minor factual errors did not undermine the main message of the film , adding " An Inconvenient Truth rests on a solid scientific foundation . " 
 Lonnie Thompson , Earth Science professor at Ohio State University , whose work on retreating glaciers was featured in the film , was pleased with how his research was presented . " It 's so hard given the breadth of this topic to be factually correct , and make sure you don 't lose your audience , " Thompson said . " As scientists , we publish our papers in Science and Nature , but very few people read those . Here 's another way to get this message out . To me , it 's an excellent overview for an introductory class at a university . What are the issues and what are the possible consequences of not doing anything about those changes ? To me , it has tremendous value . It will reach people that scientists will never reach . " 
 John Nielsen @-@ Gammon from Texas A & M University said the " main scientific argument presented in the movie is for the most part consistent with the weight of scientific evidence , but with some of the main points needing updating , correction , or qualification . " Nielsen @-@ Gammon thought the film neglected information gained from computer models , and instead relied entirely on past and current observational evidence , " perhaps because such information would be difficult for a lay audience to grasp , believe , or connect with emotionally . " 
 Steven <unk> , climatologist from Texas A & M University added that " whether scientists like it or not , An Inconvenient Truth has had a much greater impact on public opinion and public awareness of global climate change than any scientific paper or report . "

According to Gore , " Tipper and I are devoting 100 percent of the profits from the book and the movie to a new bipartisan educational campaign to further spread the message about global warming . " Paramount Classics committed 5 % of their domestic theatrical gross from the film to form a new bipartisan climate action group , Alliance for Climate Protection , dedicated to awareness and grassroots organizing .

 The film received a positive reaction from film critics and audiences . It garnered a " certified fresh " 93 % rating at Rotten Tomatoes . At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film has received an average score of 75 , based on 32 reviews . Film critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave the film " two thumbs up " . Ebert said , " In 39 years , I have never written these words in a movie review , but here they are : You owe it to yourself to see this film . If you do not , and you have grandchildren , you should explain to them why you decided not to , " calling the film " horrifying , enthralling and [ having ] the potential , I believe , to actually change public policy and begin a process which could save the Earth . " 
 New York Magazine critic David Edelstein called the film " One of the most realistic documentaries I 've ever seen — and , dry as it is , one of the most devastating in its implications . " The New Yorker 's David Remnick added that while it was " not the most entertaining film of the year ... it might be the most important " and a " brilliantly lucid , often riveting attempt to warn Americans off our hellbent path to global suicide . " New York Times reviewer A.O. Scott thought the film was " edited crisply enough to keep it from feeling like 90 minutes of C @-@ SPAN and shaped to give Mr. Gore 's argument a real sense of drama , " and " as unsettling as it can be , " Scott continued , " it is also intellectually exhilarating , and , like any good piece of pedagogy , <unk> the appetite for further study . " Bright Lights Film Journal critic Jayson <unk> declared the film 's aesthetic qualities groundbreaking , as a new genre of slideshow film . NASA climatologist James Hansen described the film as powerful , complemented by detail in the book . Hansen said that " Gore has put together a coherent account of a complex topic that Americans desperately need to understand . The story is scientifically accurate and yet should be understandable to the public , a public that is less and less drawn to science . " He added that with An Inconvenient Truth , " Al Gore may have done for global warming what Silent Spring did for pesticides . He will be attacked , but the public will have the information needed to distinguish our long @-@ term well @-@ being from short @-@ term special interests . " 
 In " extensive exit polling " of An Inconvenient Truth in " conservative suburban markets like Plano and Irvine ( Orange County ) , as well as Dallas and Long Island " , 92 percent rated " Truth " highly and 87 percent of the respondents said they 'd recommend the film to a friend . University of Washington professor Michele Poff argued that Gore was successful in communicating to conservative @-@ leaning audiences by framing the climate crisis as apolitical . " Gore ’ s and the environment ’ s identification with the Democratic Party posed a significant challenge to reaching Republicans and conservatives , as well as those disgruntled with politics in general , " Poff wrote . " To appeal to such individuals , Gore framed the matter as distinctly apolitical — as an issue both outside politics and one that was crucial regardless of one ’ s ideological leanings . These explicit attempts to frame the issue as apolitical take on further gravitas when we consider how Gore infused the film with reflections of conservative values . Indeed , Gore reached deeply into the value structure of American conservatives to highlight ideals that suggested his cause was not liberal , but rather was beyond politics , beyond ideology . " 
 = = = Critical reviews = = = 
 Several reviews criticized the film on scientific and political grounds . Journalist Ronald Bailey argued in the libertarian magazine Reason that although " Gore gets [ the science ] more right than wrong , " he exaggerates the risks . MIT atmospheric physicist Richard S. Lindzen was vocally critical of the film , writing in a June 26 , 2006 op @-@ ed in the Wall Street Journal that Gore was using a biased presentation to exploit the fears of the public for his own political gain . 
 Some other reviewers were also skeptical of Gore 's intent , wondering whether he was setting himself for another Presidential run . Boston Globe writer Peter <unk> criticized the " gauzy biographical material that seems to have been culled from old Gore campaign commercials . " Phil Hall of Film Threat gave the film a negative review , saying " An Inconvenient Truth is something you rarely see in movies today : a blatant intellectual fraud . " 
 Others felt Gore didn 't go far enough in depicting the threat Indigenous peoples faced with the dire consequences of climate change . " An Inconvenient Truth completely ignores the plight of Arctic indigenous peoples whose cultures and landscapes are facing profound changes produced by melting polar ice , " argued environmental historian Finis Dunaway .

 An Inconvenient Truth has received many different awards worldwide . The film won the 2006 Academy Awards for Best Documentary Feature and Best Original Song for Melissa Etheridge 's " I Need to Wake Up " . It is the first documentary to win 2 Oscars and the first to win a best original song Oscar . 
 After winning the 2007 Academy Award for Documentary Feature , the Oscar was awarded to director Guggenheim , who asked Gore to join him and other members of the crew on stage . Gore then gave a brief speech , saying : 
 My fellow Americans , people all over the world , we need to solve the climate crisis . It 's not a political issue ; it 's a moral issue . We have everything we need to get started , with the possible exception of the will to act . That 's a renewable resource . Let 's renew it . 
 Sight & Sound magazine conducts a poll every ten years of the world 's finest film directors to find out the Ten Greatest Films of All Time . This poll has been going since 1992 , and has become the most recognised poll of its kind in the world . In 2012 Cyrus Frisch voted for " An Inconvenient Truth " . Frisch commented : " A few years after this film was made , global industry has become more aware of its impact on nature . " 
 In addition , the film received numerous other accolades , including a special recognition from the Humanitas Prize , the first time the organization had handed out a Special Award in over 10 years , the 2007 Stanley Kramer Award from The Producers Guild of America , which recognizes " work that dramatically illustrates provocative social issues " and the President ’ s Award 2007 from the Society for Technical Communication " for demonstrating that effective and understandable technical communication , when coupled with passion and vision , has the power to educate — and change — the world .

" White House deputy press secretary Dana <unk> stated that " The president noted in 2001 the increase in temperatures over the past 100 years and that the increase in greenhouse gases was due to a certain extent to human activity " . 
 Several United States Senators screened the film . New Mexico Democratic Senator Jeff Bingaman and Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid saw the movie at its Washington premiere at the National Geographic Society . New Mexico Democratic Senator Tom Udall planned to see the film saying " It 's such a powerful statement because of the way the movie is put together , I tell everybody , Democrat or Republican , they 've got to go see this movie . " Former New Mexico Republican Senator Pete Domenici thought Gore 's prominence on the global warming issue made it more difficult to get a consensus in Congress . Bingaman disputed this saying , " It seems to me we were having great difficulty recruiting Republican members of Congress to support a bill before Al Gore came up with this movie . " 
 Oklahoma Republican Senator Jim Inhofe , then @-@ chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , didn 't plan to see the film ( which he appears in ) , and compared it to Adolf Hitler 's book " Mein Kampf " . " If you say the same lie over and over again , and particularly if you have the media 's support , people will believe it , " Inhofe said , adding that he thought Gore was trying to use the issue to run for president again in 2008 . 
 In contrast to Inhofe , Arizona Republican Senator John McCain , did not criticize Gore 's efforts or the movie , which he planned to see . 
 Tennessee Republican Senator Lamar Alexander , said " Because ( Gore ) was a former vice president and presidential nominee , he brings a lot of visibility to ( the issue ) , " Alexander said . " On the other hand it may be seen as political by some , and they may be less eager to be a part of it . " Alexander also criticized the omission of nuclear power in the film . " Maybe it needs a sequel : ' An Inconvenient Truth 2 : Nuclear Power . ' " 
 In September 2006 , Gore traveled to Sydney , Australia to promote the film . Then @-@ Australian Prime Minister John Howard said he would not meet with Gore or agree to Kyoto because of the movie : " I don 't take policy advice from films . " Former Opposition Leader Kim Beazley joined Gore for a viewing and other MPs attended a special screening at Parliament House earlier in the week . After winning the general election a year later , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ratified Kyoto in his first week of office , leaving the United States the only industrialized nation in the world not to have signed the treaty . 
 In the United Kingdom , Conservative party leader and future Prime Minister David Cameron urged people to watch the film in order to understand climate change . 
 In Belgium , Margaretha Guidone persuaded the entire Belgian government to see the film . 200 politicians and political staff accepted her invitation , among whom were Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt and Minister @-@ President of Flanders , Yves <unk> . Gore received the Prince of Asturias Prize in 2007 for international cooperation . 
 In Costa Rica , the film was screened by president Oscar Arias . Arias 's subsequent championing of the climate change issue was greatly influenced by the film .

 In May 2007 , Stewart Dimmock — a lorry ( HGV ) driver , school governor from Kent , England , and member of a right @-@ wing group called the New Party — challenged the UK Government 's distribution of the film in a lawsuit , Dimmock v Secretary of State for Education and Skills , with help from political ally and New Party founder Viscount Monckton , who notably pointed out " 35 serious scientific errors " . The plaintiffs sought an injunction preventing the screening of the film in English schools , arguing that by law schools are forbidden to promote partisan political views and , when dealing with political issues , are required to provide a balanced presentation of opposing views . 
 On October 10 , 2007 , Justice Michael Burton , after explaining that the requirement for a balanced presentation does not warrant that equal weight be given to alternative views of a mainstream view , ruled that it was clear that the film was substantially founded upon scientific research and fact , albeit that the science had been used , in the hands of a " talented politician and communicator " , to make a political statement and to support a political program . The judge ruled that An Inconvenient Truth contained nine scientific errors and thus must be accompanied by an explanation of those errors before being shown to school children . The judge said that showing the film without the explanations of error would be a violation of education laws . 
 The judge concluded " I have no doubt that Dr Stott , the Defendant 's expert , is right when he says that : ' Al Gore 's presentation of the causes and likely effects of climate change in the film was broadly accurate . ' " On the basis of testimony from Robert M. Carter and the arguments put forth by the claimant 's lawyers , the judge also pointed to nine " errors " , i.e. statements the truth of which he did not rule on , but that he found to depart from the mainstream scientific positions on global warming . He also found that some of these departures from the mainstream arose in the context of alarmism and exaggeration in support of political theses . Since the government had already accepted to amend the guidance notes to address these along with other points in a fashion that the judge found satisfactory , no order was made on the application . 
 Each side declared victory . Government Minister of Children , Young People and Families , Kevin Brennan stated : " We have updated the accompanying guidance , as requested by the judge to make it clearer for teachers as to the stated Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change position on a number of scientific points raised in the film . " Plaintiff Dimmock complained that " no amount of turgid guidance " could change his view that the film was unsuitable for the classroom . A spokesman for Gore said : " Of the thousands of facts in the film , the judge only took issue with just a handful . And of that handful , we have the studies to back those pieces up . "

 In the United States , 50 @,@ 000 free copies of An Inconvenient Truth were offered to the National Science Teachers Association ( NSTA ) , which declined to take them . Producer David provided an email correspondence from the NSTA detailing that their reasoning was that the DVDs would place " unnecessary risk upon the [ NSTA ] capital campaign , especially certain targeted supporters , " and that they saw " little , if any , benefit to NSTA or its members " in accepting the free DVDs . A Washington Post editorial called the decision " Science a la Joe Camel " , citing for example that the NSTA had received $ 6 million since 1996 from Exxon Mobil , which had a representative on the organization 's corporate board . In public , the NSTA argued that distributing this film to its members would have been contrary to a long @-@ standing NSTA policy against distributing unsolicited materials to its members . The NSTA also said that they had offered several other options for distributing the film but ultimately " [ it ] appears that these alternative distribution mechanisms were unsatisfactory . " David has said that NSTA Executive Director Gerry Wheeler promised in a telephone conversation to explore alternatives with NSTA 's board for advertising the film but she had not yet received an alternative offer at the time of NSTA 's public claim . She also said that she rejected their subsequent offers because they were nothing more than offers to sell their " commercially available member mailing list " and advertising space in their magazine and newsletter , which are available to anyone . She noted that in the past , NSTA had shipped out 20 @,@ 000 copies of a 10 @-@ part video produced by Wheeler with funding provided by ConocoPhillips in 2003 . NSTA indicated that they retained editorial control over the content , which David questioned based on the point of view portrayed in the global warming section of the video . 
 The American Association for the Advancement of Science publication <unk> published an assessment discussing both sides of the NSTA decision in which it was reported that " David says NSTA 's imprimatur [ i.e. endorsement or sanction ] was essential and that buying a mailing list is a nonstarter . ' You don 't want to send out a cold letter , and it costs a lot of money , ' she says . ' There are a thousand reasons why that wouldn 't work . ' " 
 In January 2007 , the Federal Way ( Washington State ) School Board voted to require an approval by the principal and the superintendent for teachers to show the film to students and that the teachers must include the presentation of an approved " opposing view " . The moratorium was repealed , at a meeting on January 23 , after a predominantly negative community reaction . Shortly thereafter , the school board in Yakima , Washington , calling the film a " controversial issue " , prevented the Environmental Club of Eisenhower High School from showing it , pending review by the school board , teachers , principal , and parents . It lifted the stay a month later , upon the approval by a review panel .

 Former ACT New Zealand Member of Parliament Muriel Newman filed a petition to have New Zealand schoolchildren be protected from political indoctrination by putting provisions that resembled those in the UK to the Education Act . The petition was in response to concerned parents talked with Newman after An Inconvenient Truth was shown in schools in 2007 . The parents were worried that teachers were not pointing out supposed inaccuracies in the film and were not explaining differing viewpoints .

 An Inconvenient Truth was scored by Michael Brook with an accompanying theme song played during the end credits by Melissa Etheridge . Brook explained that he wanted to bring out the emotion expressed in the film : " ... in Inconvenient Truth , there 's a lot of information and it 's kind of a lecture , in a way , and very well organized and very well presented , but it 's a lot to absorb . And the director , Guggenheim , wanted to have – sort of give people a little break every once in a while and say , okay , you don 't have to absorb this information , you can just sort of – and it was more the personal side of Al Gore 's life or how it connected to the theme of the film . And that 's when there 's music . " 
 Etheridge agreed to write An Inconvenient Truth 's theme song , " I Need to Wake Up " after viewing Gore 's slide show . " I was so honored he would ask me to contribute to a project that is so powerful and so important , I felt such a huge responsibility , " she said . " Then I went , ' What am I going to write ? What am I going to say ? ' " Etheridge 's former partner , Tammy Lynn Michaels , told her : " Write what you feel , because that 's what people are going to feel . " Of Etheridge 's commitment to the project , Gore said , " Melissa is a rare soul who gives a lot of time and effort to causes in which she strongly believes . " Etheridge received the 2006 Academy Award for Best Original Song for " I Need to Wake Up . " Upon receiving the award , she noted in her acceptance speech : 
 Mostly I have to thank Al Gore , for inspiring us , for inspiring me , showing that caring about the Earth is not Republican or Democrat ; it 's not red or blue , it 's all green .

 = Ron Hextall = 
 Ronald Jeffrey Hextall ( born May 3 , 1964 ) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played 13 National Hockey League ( NHL ) seasons for the Philadelphia Flyers , Quebec Nordiques , and New York Islanders . He served as Assistant General Manager for the Flyers for one season , and was promoted to General Manager of the Philadelphia Flyers , replacing Paul Holmgren on May 7 , 2014 . Before this he served as Assistant General Manager for the Los Angeles Kings , who won the Stanley Cup in 2012 . 
 Hextall played 11 of his 13 seasons over two stints with the Flyers . He holds several team records and is a member of the Flyers Hall of Fame . During his rookie season in 1986 – 87 , he was awarded the Vezina Trophy as the league 's top goaltender and led the Flyers to the Stanley Cup Finals . Despite the Flyers ' loss to the Edmonton Oilers in seven games , he won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs ' most valuable player , making him one of only five players to win the trophy in a losing effort . Injuries in the middle of his career contributed to a drop in his playing ability ; as a result , he was traded on three occasions in the off @-@ seasons between 1992 and 1994 to the Quebec Nordiques , the New York Islanders and then back to the Flyers . Upon his return to Philadelphia , Hextall regained confidence and form , recording goals against averages ( GAA ) below 3 @.@ 00 in each of his five subsequent seasons – the lowest of his career . He retired from the NHL at the end of the 1998 – 99 season . 
 Hextall became the first NHL goaltender to score a goal by shooting the puck into the opponent 's empty net , against the Boston Bruins in the 1987 – 88 season . The following season , he became the first goaltender to score in the playoffs , by shooting the puck into the Washington Capitals ' empty net . His mobile style of play , in which he provided support to his defencemen by coming out of the goal area to play the puck was revolutionary , and inspired future generations of goaltenders , such as Martin Brodeur . He was also known for being one of the NHL 's most aggressive goaltenders : he was suspended for six or more games on three occasions , had more than 100 penalty minutes in each of his first three seasons , and set new records for the number of penalty minutes recorded by a goaltender in the NHL . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Ron Hextall was born on May 3 , 1964 in Brandon , Manitoba , the third and youngest child of Bryan and Fay Hextall . Hextall is a third @-@ generation NHL player - his grandfather , Hall of Famer Bryan Hextall , played 11 seasons with the New York Rangers , and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1969 . His father , Bryan Hextall , Jr . , played in the NHL for 10 seasons , most notably for the Pittsburgh Penguins , and his uncle , Dennis Hextall , played 14 seasons of NHL hockey , not staying with any one club for longer than five years . During his youth , Hextall saw his father and uncle often roughed up by the Philadelphia Flyers , whose aggressive style of play for much of the 1970s gave the team the name " Broad Street Bullies " . Hextall later reflected that during this period he " hated the Flyers . " 
 Because of his father 's career , Hextall 's education was far from stable ; each year began at Brandon , and once the hockey season commenced in October , he moved to a school nearer to where his father was playing . At school , he achieved B and C grades , putting in the minimum amount of effort , but his mind remained on hockey , and specifically goaltending . " Everybody else would be working and I 'd be drawing pictures of Tony Esposito and Jimmy Rutherford , " he recalled . Hextall came to mostly enjoy the constant moving , later saying " I got to hang around NHL rinks . What more would I have wanted ? " 
 Although both his father and grandfather played as forwards , his father was happy for him to play in goal , but insisted that he try other positions to improve his skating : Bryan believed his son would have made a good defenceman . Hextall 's mother thought her son 's love for hockey exceeded that of her husband 's teammates and believed it would drive him to achieve his aim of goaltending in the NHL . Each summer , Hextall received training at the hockey school at which his father taught , but the hockey programs in Pittsburgh and Atlanta were sub @-@ standard , and meant that during his teenage years , he was behind many of his fellow players . He describes himself as " [ not ] what you would call real polished " in his first year of junior hockey , aged 17 .

 Hextall began his junior hockey career with the Melville Millionaires in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League ( SJHL ) . In his solitary season with the club , he played 37 games with a goals against average ( GAA ) of 6 @.@ 57 . In one game that season , against the Prince Albert Raiders , Hextall faced 105 shots , and made 84 saves , a performance described as brilliant by the Regina Leader @-@ Post . Although the Millionaires lost 21 – 2 , the reporter noted that if it was not for Hextall , the Raiders could have scored " 34 or 35 " . Millionaires teammate Mark <unk> praised his performance , particularly the way " he lived up to his responsibilities and stayed in there until the end . " In 2009 , Hextall was inducted as one of the inaugural members of the SJHL Hall of Fame . 
 Hextall returned to Brandon for the 1981 – 82 season , playing for the Brandon Wheat Kings in the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) . He played 30 regular season games for the Wheat Kings , during which he recorded a GAA of 5 @.@ 71 . The Wheat Kings reached the playoffs but were swept four games to none ( 4 – 0 ) in the first @-@ round by the Regina Pats . Hextall played in three of the games , but completed only two and had a GAA of 9 @.@ 32 . His team was regarded as a poor one at the time by critics and Hextall had to battle in each game . Flyers ' scout Gerry Melnyk said he could understand why many teams did not rate Hextall : " There were teams who thought he was loony . " Melnyk claimed it was these attributes which he was attracted by , and he felt that Hextall could fit in well with the Flyers . Subsequently , the Flyers chose Hextall in the sixth round of the 1982 NHL Draft , 119th overall . 
 After his selection , Hextall remained with Brandon for two further seasons . He played 44 games in 1982 – 83 , recording a GAA of 5 @.@ 77 during a season in which the Wheat Kings did not qualify for the playoffs . The following year was his most successful in the WHL : a GAA of 4 @.@ 29 across his 46 regular season games , which included 29 wins – more than in the previous two seasons combined . He played in ten of the twelve playoff games , recording five wins and five losses , with a GAA of 3 @.@ 75 . During the 1983 – 84 season , Hextall set a record for the most penalty minutes accumulated by a goaltender , being assessed for 117 minutes during the regular season .

 Hextall arrived at the Philadelphia Flyers training camp in 1984 with the expectation of playing in the NHL . However , the Flyers subsequently sent him to their farm team in the International Hockey League ( IHL ) , the Kalamazoo Wings . Although disappointed , Hextall was now playing at a higher level than at WHL and made his debut in professional hockey . He played 19 games for Kalamazoo , recording six wins and a GAA of 4 @.@ 35 . During the season , he moved to the Flyers ' other farm team ; Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) , where he played 11 times , with four wins , and a GAA of 3 @.@ 68 . 
 In the following season , Hextall remained with Hershey , appearing in 53 games during the 1985 – 86 season . He recorded 30 wins and the lowest GAA average of his career to that point , 3 @.@ 41 . The Bears finished the regular season as league leaders , and won the John D. Chick Trophy as the South Division Champions . Hextall lived up to his aggressive reputation in the Conference final , played against the St. Catharines Saints , fighting three different members of the opposition side during a single bench @-@ clearing brawl . The Bears advanced to the Calder Cup final , having beaten the New Haven Nighthawks 4 – 1 and the St. Catharines Saints 4 – 3 . In the final , they faced the Adirondack Red Wings , who won the championship by four games to two . Hextall played 13 games in the playoffs , of which his team won five , and his GAA was 3 @.@ 23 . He was named as the Dudley " Red " Garrett Memorial Award winner , as the AHL 's outstanding rookie player . Looking back on his time in the AHL , Hextall reflected that despite his initial disappointment at not being selected to play for the Flyers straight away , " the two years that I spent in the American League got me to the point where I was sure I could be a No. 1 goaltender at the NHL level . "

 After his performances in the AHL , Hextall was invited to the Flyers ' training camp as a long @-@ shot . His play in four exhibition games convinced Flyers ' coach Mike Keenan to call up Hextall to the NHL , and to play him in the opening game of the season , against the Edmonton Oilers . Hextall conceded a goal from the first shot he faced in the game , but allowed no further shots past him , leading his side to a 2 – 1 victory . Hextall continued to display the aggressive nature with which he had always played , swinging his stick at Brad Smith and Troy Murray early in his first NHL season . Despite these swipes , Hextall claimed at the time that , " I used to be worse , I 've learned to control my temper . " Two months after making these comments , Hextall was involved in a fight with opposing New Jersey Devils goaltender Alain Chevrier . Having lost to the Devils , the Flyers wanted revenge for Steve Richmond 's punch on Kjell Samuelsson at the end of the game ; Hextall targeted Chevrier in a fight labelled by Chico Resch as " like a heavyweight against a lightweight . " Hextall and seven other players were fined $ 300 each for their part in the brawl . 
 In 66 regular season games during his rookie year , Hextall posted a GAA of 3 @.@ 00 , and recorded 37 wins . His was awarded the Vezina Trophy for the most outstanding goaltender by the NHL general managers , but he was second in the voting to Luc Robitaille for the Calder Memorial Trophy , awarded to the " player selected as the most proficient in his first year of competition " . Hextall led the Flyers to top their Conference , and win the Prince of Wales Trophy . The Flyers progressed to face the Edmonton Oilers in the Stanley Cup Finals , having beaten the New York Rangers 4 – 2 , the New York Islanders 4 – 3 , and the Montreal Canadiens 4 – 2 . Following their series victory over Montreal , Flyers captain Dave Poulin identified Hextall as the team 's leading performer . In the fourth game of the Finals , Hextall received two penalties , first a ten @-@ minute misconduct penalty for " expressing his displeasure at the fourth Oiler goal , " and later a five @-@ minute penalty for slashing Kent Nilsson . In the latter incident , Hextall had received a slash from Glenn Anderson for which there was no call from the referees , and Hextall sought revenge by striking the back of Nilsson 's knees . After the game Hextall expressed remorse for striking the wrong player but not for his action : 
 " If somebody slaps you in the face , you 're going to slap him back , it 's not like he gave me a touch to jar the puck . What 's he going to do next , break my arm ? I 'm sorry it was Nilsson and not Anderson I hit , but I just reacted . At the time , it seemed the right thing to do . " 
 The performance of Hextall in the next game tied the series and forced a seventh game ; at the end , the Flyers team surrounded Hextall in congratulation and the Oilers player Kevin Lowe said that Hextall " held them in it " . Between the sixth and seventh games , the Oilers ' forward Wayne Gretzky described Hextall as " probably the best goaltender I 've ever played against in the NHL " Edmonton won the final game of the series to take the Stanley Cup . Robin Finn , writing in The New York Times , said that the team won the title " without their trademark , those endless waves of madcap scoring " , primarily due to the " heroics of Hextall " . Flyers teammate Rick Tocchet said that when he realised his side were going to lose , his " first thought was to feel sorry for Ronny Hextall , because he did everything he could to get us here and keep us in it . " Hextall was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy for the most valuable player in the playoffs , becoming only the fourth player from a losing side to be awarded the trophy . During the off @-@ season , Hextall received an eight @-@ game suspension for the start of the 1987 – 88 season after his slash on Nilsson . Speaking on behalf of the NHL , Brian O 'Neill said that : " There is no justification for any player to swing his stick in retaliation and this is especially the case for a goaltender whose stick , because of its weight , can cause serious injury . " 
 The Flyers had a difficult start to the 1987 – 88 season , partly attributed by Keenan to the absence of Hextall . Hextall returned to the Flyers line @-@ up against the New York Rangers , and made over 40 saves in a 2 – 2 tie . Just over a month later , Hextall became the first goaltender to shoot at goal and score in the NHL when he scored an empty net goal towards the end of a game against the Boston Bruins . The Flyers led 4 – 2 which prompted the Bruins to pull their goaltender in favour of an extra attacker . The puck was dumped into the Philadelphia zone by the Bruins , and Hextall picked it up without any players near him ; his shot fired into the air , bounced and rolled into the net . Hextall had targeted becoming the " first NHL goaltender to score a true goal " over a year earlier , and , speaking after the game , commented that : " I knew I could do it . It was a matter of when . " Despite his early season suspension , and a shoulder injury late in the season which made him miss five games , Hextall played 62 of the 67 games for which he was available during the regular season . He recorded 30 wins , and a GAA of 3 @.@ 50 , slightly higher than during his rookie year . Hextall struggled in the playoffs : he was replaced in successive games of the series against the Washington Capitals having conceded four goals in each . In the final two games of the series , which the Capitals won 4 – 3 , Hextall gave up a further 12 goals , and completed the playoffs with a GAA of 4 @.@ 75 . 
 In each of his first two seasons , Hextall accumulated 104 penalty minutes during the regular season , the first time that a goaltender had collected over 100 . In the 1988 – 89 season , he broke his own record , being assessed 113 penalty minutes , the most by any goaltender in an NHL season ( as of 2015 ) . Hextall completed the 1988 – 89 regular season with 30 wins , the third consecutive season in which he had recorded so many , and the first time a goaltender had recorded 30 wins in each of their first three seasons in the NHL . The Flyers finished fourth in the Patrick Division and qualified for the playoffs . They faced the Washington Capitals in the first round , and the teams shared the first four games . The Flyers won the fifth , despite being 5 – 4 down in the third period . Flyers ' defenceman Mark Howe credited their victory to Hextall . Late in the game , the Capitals pulled their goaltender , and Hextall scored the second goal of his career . The puck was shot into the Flyers ' left defensive zone by Scott Stevens , and Hextall went around the back of his net , controlled the puck and shot at goal . He became the first goaltender to score a goal in the NHL playoffs . The Flyers won 8 – 5 , and went on to win the series 4 – 2 , which Joe Sexton of the New York Times attributed primarily to Hextall 's return to form . 
 Against the Penguins in the Patrick Division Final , Hextall 's performances were mixed : he under @-@ performed early in the series , and in game five was swapped out of the net and then reinstated twice during a 10 – 7 defeat for the Flyers . Hextall faced 17 shots in the game , conceding nine of the Penguins goals . After the game , he denied being out of control , despite having assaulted one of the officials and chasing Rob Brown around the ice . He said , " I like to think I 'm strong mentally . Hey , if I was as out of control as people say I am , I wouldn 't be in the National Hockey League . " The Penguins coach , Gene <unk> , agreed with Hextall 's assessment , and believed the goaltender lost control intentionally : " He uses a loss of control to his advantage , in a way . He 's the extreme example of controlled violence . And they [ the Flyers ] live and die with it . " The Flyers won the next game to force a decider , but Hextall was ruled out of the contest with a first degree sprain of the medial collateral ligament ( MCL ) in his right knee . Hextall 's injury kept him out of the first three games of the series against the Canadiens , during which the Canadiens took a 2 – 1 lead . He returned for the fourth game , but could not prevent his side losing 3 – 0 . The Flyers won the following game to extend the series to six games , but lost the next game 4 – 2 , and were eliminated . Hextall displayed his violent side during the final minutes of game six , skating out of his crease to attack Chris Chelios . Hextall claimed that the attack was in retaliation for Chelios ' hit on his Flyer teammate Brian Propp in game one , when Chelios caught Flyer Propp with a " flying elbow " to the side of the head , rendering him unconscious . Hextall was given a 12 @-@ game suspension for his actions , at the beginning of the 1989 – 90 season . Following the announcement of the suspension , Hextall stated his disappointment , and added that his intention was to fight rather than hurt Chelios .

 Prior to the 1989 – 90 season , Hextall became unhappy that his eight @-@ year , $ 4 million contract was only earning him $ 325 @,@ 000 a year , and hired a confrontational agent , Ritch Winter , to renegotiate his contract . The Flyers refused to deal with the agent , and at a tearful press conference , Hextall declared his contract invalid and announced that he would not take part in the team 's training camp . After negotiations about which neither side revealed details , Hextall returned to practice with the team on October 20 , 42 days later . Hextall suffered a slight groin pull during his first game back , and in his second , he hurt his left hamstring . Just under a month later , while playing for the Hershey Bears in an attempt to establish his fitness , he was carried off the ice after once more hurting his groin . In total that season , Hextall appeared nine times ; once for the Bears in the AHL , and eight times for the Flyers . In the NHL , he recorded a GAA of 4 @.@ 15 , the highest he averaged during any single season of the NHL . 
 Hextall continued to be plagued by groin injuries during the next two seasons , twice straining his left groin muscle in the 1990 – 91 season . The Flyers ' <unk> , Dr. Arthur Bartolozzi , suggested a possible reason for his series of injuries : 
 " He is in motion anticipating the shot before the guy even hits the puck . So he 's already on the ice or doing a split or anticipating the shot well before it 's made . That 's probably what makes him a great goaltender . But it 's also what may predispose him to injury . " 
 In 1990 – 91 , Hextall appeared in 36 NHL games , less than half of those played by the Flyers that season . He recorded 13 wins , with a GAA of 3 @.@ 13 . For the second successive year , the Flyers failed to qualify for the playoffs . Early the following season , Hextall received the third significant suspension of his career , missing six games for slashing Detroit forward Jim Cummins during a pre @-@ season game . Suspension , further injuries , and a lack of form meant Hextall appeared 45 times for the Flyers . He recorded 16 wins during the season , resulting in his lowest win percentage in the NHL , 35 @.@ 56 % . 
 = = = Quebec Nordiques = = = 
 In the 1992 off @-@ season , Hextall was part of the trade which brought Eric Lindros to the Philadelphia Flyers . Lindros , who had been picked first overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1991 entry draft , had refused to play for Quebec during the 1991 – 92 season , forcing the club 's owner Marcel Aubut to trade him . While negotiating to get the best possible deal , Aubut traded Lindros to both the Flyers and the Rangers , meaning an arbitrator had to rule which club should receive him . During the ten days between the trades being made and the arbitrator 's ruling , there was a lot of speculation about which Flyers ' and Rangers ' players were involved in the potential trades . Hextall was among the players mentioned , something which he was unhappy about . Speaking through his agent , Hextall admitted to being " scared to death " about the possibility of moving with his family to the French @-@ speaking area . On July 30 , the arbitrator ruled in favour of the Philadelphia Flyers , and Hextall was traded to Quebec , along with five other players , two first round selections ( in 1993 and 1994 ) , and $ 15 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cash for Lindros . 
 In the New York Times preview of the Adams Division for the 1992 – 93 season , Hextall is described as " inconsistent and injury @-@ prone " , while the players gained in the Lindros trade are collected dubbed as " good players but no superstars . " Hextall regained some of the confidence he displayed during his first years in Philadelphia , and although a strained thigh muscle kept him out towards the end of the regular season , he helped the Nordiques to reach the playoffs for the first time since 1987 . Quebec were eliminated 4 – 2 by the Montreal Canadiens in the first round , during which Hextall was praised as being " at the top of his game " . 
 = = = New York Islanders = = = 
 After only one season at the Nordiques , Hextall was traded to the New York Islanders in return for Mark Fitzpatrick during the off @-@ season , a move made because the Nordiques could only protect one goalie for the expansion draft and instead of losing him chose to trade him to Long Island . The two teams also traded first round draft picks . The move was a surprise for Hextall , who had settled in well in Quebec with his family . Don Maloney , the Islanders ' General Manager , described the trade as " too good to pass up " . The trade was praised by the New York Times as possibly " the best in the league over the off season " . Hextall had a poor beginning to his career as an Islander , conceding 23 goals in 14 periods at the start of the season , resulting in his replacement prior to the third period against the New Jersey Devils in mid @-@ October . During that game , in which the Islanders were playing at home , Hextall was jeered by the crowd , something to which he had become accustomed during his time with Philadelphia . In contrast to the fan 's derision , Hextall 's teammates backed him , taking some of the blame themselves , and expressing their belief in their new colleague . Steve Thomas suggested that Hextall was " one of the best goalies in the league , easily in the top five or 10 , " while coach Al Arbour dismissed dropping Hextall , saying that " We 're not playing well in front of the goaltender and he can only be as good as the guys in front of him . " Any thoughts that Arbour might have had of replacing Hextall as the team 's number @-@ one goaltender were limited by the play of his back @-@ up , Tom Draper , who recorded a GAA of 4 @.@ 23 in the seven NHL games he played that season . This , coupled with the lack of experienced goaltenders at the club 's IHL affiliate , the Salt Lake Golden Eagles , resulted in Hextall starting 20 games in a row until Jamie McLennan was called up from the Golden Eagles . 
 The break , and challenge , that Hextall was afforded by McLennan 's call @-@ up helped him to recover his form , and in February , he made consecutive shutouts against the Ottawa Senators and Washington Capitals . He recorded another shutout in his next home game , against the Flyers , and was shortly thereafter named as the NHL 's player of the week . During the regular season with the Islanders , Hextall recorded a career @-@ best five shutouts , and a GAA of 3 @.@ 08 , the best since his rookie year . Maloney described Hextall 's time with the team as having " a slow start and a disastrous finish " . The Islanders reached the playoffs , but were swept 4 – 0 by their rivals , the New York Rangers . Hextall played three of the four games , conceding 16 goals for a GAA of 6 @.@ 08 , the worst average of his NHL career by some distance . After the season had concluded , Maloney said that he believed that only two Islanders players had distinguished themselves during the 1993 – 94 season , with one of those being Jamie McLennan . He also praised Hextall 's play during his long sequence of starts , but five months later , Maloney traded Hextall back to Philadelphia . He described the move as being two @-@ pronged : it would appease the fans and prevent the derisory calls when the team were struggling , and it would give McLennan a chance to establish himself as the number @-@ one goaltender . Hextall , along with a sixth round draft pick was traded to the Flyers in return for goaltender Tommy Söderström . 
 = = = Return to Philadelphia = = = 
 In his first season back in Philadelphia , Hextall played 31 games , recording his lowest GAA in a season to that point , 2 @.@ 89 . The Flyers reached the playoffs for the first time in six years . After defeating the Buffalo Sabres in the first round , the Flyers faced the New York Rangers in the second . Following the Rangers sweep of the Islanders the previous season , the Rangers ' fans chanted " We Want Hex @-@ tall ! " during their game @-@ six victory in the first round . The Flyers ' coach , Terry Murray dismissed the chants , stating that " emotionally he 's really under control . " The New York Times supported this belief , claiming that " this isn 't the same Ron Hextall they remember so fondly " . The Flyers won the first two games of the series , and at Madison Square Garden , Hextall had a quiet game in which he even acted as a calming influence to teammates Kevin Haller and Dmitri <unk> , a turnaround from the aggressiveness he had displayed earlier in his career . The Flyers swept the Rangers 4 – 0 and advanced to the Conference Final against the New Jersey Devils , to whom they lost 4 – 2 . Hextall 's statistics in the playoffs were his best since his rookie year : he recorded ten wins with a GAA of 2 @.@ 81 . 
 For the first time in three seasons , Hextall was not traded during the off @-@ season , and remained with the Flyers for the 1995 – 96 season . During the regular season , Hextall improved on his figures from the previous year , passing 30 wins for the first time since 1988 – 89 . His GAA of 2 @.@ 17 was both the best in the NHL that year , and the best of Hextall 's career . In the playoffs , Hextall played in all twelve of the Flyers ' games , a 4 – 2 first round victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning followed by a 4 – 2 defeat to the Florida Panthers . His GAA of 2 @.@ 13 was his lowest recorded in any post @-@ season . He continued to perform well over the next two seasons , passing 30 wins again in 1996 – 97 , and adding another nine shutouts to the four he had made in 1995 – 96 . Over his first five seasons in the NHL , Hextall only made one shutout , while in his final six seasons , he achieved the feat on nineteen occasions . The Flyers progressed to the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals , though Hextall only appeared in eight playoff games , finishing seven of them . Throughout the season and the playoffs , the uncertainty in goal resulted in Hextall and Garth Snow swapping places regularly . Snow started nine of the ten games during the first two rounds , but Hextall replaced him in game two of the Conference Final , and remained the starting goaltender for the remainder of the series . A loss against the Detroit Red Wings in the first game of the Stanley Cup finals resulted in coach Murray switching back to Snow for the second game . Hextall returned for games three and four , but the Flyers were swept 4 – 0 by the Red Wings . 
 In his final two playing seasons , both spent at the Flyers , Hextall made fewer appearances ; he played 46 games in 1997 – 98 , and 23 the following year . He maintained a sub @-@ three GAA in each year , repeating the achievement in each of his final five seasons in the NHL having failed to do so in the previous eight seasons . At the end of 1998 – 99 , Hextall was waived by the Flyers , and after going unclaimed in the expansion draft , he announced his retirement on September 6 , 1999 . 
 = = International career = = 
 Hextall 's first international recognition came when he was named as part of Team Canada 's squad for the 1987 Canada Cup . During a practice session , he chopped Sylvain Turgeon 's arm with his stick during a scrimmage , claiming that the left wing was too close to the goal . Turgeon missed the tournament with a fractured arm ; Hextall was back @-@ up to Grant Fuhr and did not play a single game . He later represented Canada in the 1992 World Championships , playing five games to record one win and a GAA of 2 @.@ 86 as Canada were eliminated in the quarter @-@ finals . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Hextall brought a new style of goaltending to the NHL , providing support to his two defencemen due to his willingness to come out of the net and play the puck . He was known for his excellent puck @-@ handling ability . In Hextall 's time , goaltenders would limit themselves to stopping the puck behind the net , make short push passes , or at most clear the puck out of the zone with " clumsy " backhands . He distinguished himself by using his stick as a defenceman would ; for example , he was capable of starting a counterattack , easily lifting the puck or bouncing it off the glass . Hextall 's puck @-@ handling ability meant that it was inadvisable to try a dump and chase strategy of sending the puck in a corner , regaining it , and establishing an attack in the offensive zone , because Hextall would invariably get to the puck first and clear it out of his zone towards a waiting player in the neutral zone . He was described by former NHL player Peter McNab as the " original outlet pass goalie " . 
 While playing junior hockey , Hextall 's coaches advised him that he would not reach the NHL if he continued to move the puck . Not everyone agreed ; NHL goaltender Darren Pang described feeling as if " he had just witnessed Superman flying out of a phone booth " when he saw Hextall 's <unk> ability in a minor league game . Former NHL goaltender Johnny Bower , when scouting for the Toronto Maple Leafs in Brandon , remarked that Hextall would at times let in soft goals , and doubted if he would reach the NHL ; Hextall retained a tendency to let in occasional weak goals throughout his career . Hextall claims his adventurous style stemmed from his youth , when he played on outdoor ice rinks with a skater 's stick , rather than the <unk> goaltender 's stick . Martin Brodeur modelled his own play on that of Hextall , saying " I love the fact that he was playing the puck . He was one of the first goalies that came out and played the puck . He was a little rough for my liking , but it was entertaining . The playing of the puck was the big thing . " Hextall 's mobility provided extra passing opportunities for his defencemen : when killing a penalty they would frequently pass the puck back to him , relieving some of the pressure on his team . He is described on the Hockey Hall of Fame 's Legends of Hockey website as being " perhaps the game 's most mobile goalie of all time . " 
 Frank Orr , a columnist in the Toronto Star , suggested that Hextall 's aggressive nature , which resulted in three suspensions of six or more games during his NHL career , was an intentional part of his game designed to protect him . He theorized that because Hextall 's style of play frequently took him out of his goal crease , the threat of physical violence lessened the chances of him being challenged by an attacker when out of position . In the 1993 playoff series between the Montreal Canadiens and Hextall 's Nordiques , the Canadiens ' coach Jacques Demers designed a plan to disrupt Hextall 's play after Montreal had lost its two first games to Quebec . He noted that Hextall would be off his game if he were disturbed or bumped . Montreal then won four straight games to win the series in six games . Demers felt that Hextall 's emotional play lessened his effectiveness ; while acknowledging him as a " great competitor " , he felt that " he didn 't reach the level of a Grant Fuhr or a Martin Brodeur [ because ] he lost his cool if you got in his face . " 
 <unk> Vachon , who served as the General Manager of the Los Angeles Kings during the early part of the Hextall 's playing career , praised his goaltending ability , but felt that his aggressive conduct " shouldn 't be in hockey and I think it tarnishes his image , too . He can play . He doesn 't need that ( stuff ) . " His view was shared by many , leading Hextall to be tagged as one of the most " revered and reviled " players in the league . Former NHL goaltender John Davidson commented that Hextall " thrived " on being a villain ; he further described him as a " great character " , and noted that " when he came to town , fans would want to race to the arena to boo him . " 
 = = Management career = = 
 Upon his retirement from playing in 1999 , Hextall immediately joined the Philadelphia Flyers ' set @-@ up as a Professional Scout . He was promoted to Director of Professional Player Personnel three years later , and was considered by the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame to be a key factor in the success experienced by the Flyers during the early 2000s , when they won the Atlantic Division three times , and reached the Eastern Conference Finals on two occasions . In June 2006 , Hextall moved to the Los Angeles Kings to take on the role of Vice President and Assistant General Manager . In addition , Hextall served as the General Manager of the Manchester Monarchs of the AHL , the Kings ' primary affiliate . On June 11 , 2012 , Hextall won the Stanley Cup that eluded him in 1987 and 1997 , this time as the Assistant General Manager of the Los Angeles Kings . On July 15 , 2013 , Hextall returned to the Flyers , being named Assistant General Manager and Director of Hockey Operations . On May 7 , 2014 , Hextall was named General Manager of the Flyers , following the promotion of Paul Holmgren to team President .

 Hextall married Diane <unk> , a former figure skater , and the pair have four children ; Kristin , Brett , Rebecca , and Jeffrey . Brett Hextall was drafted by the Phoenix Coyotes as a sixth @-@ round pick ( 159th overall ) in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft . He was signed to an entry @-@ level contract with the team in April 2011 , and if he plays in the NHL will become the second fourth @-@ generation player in NHL history , after Blake Geoffrion .
