 The music video was filmed the weekend of February 6 , 2010 in Miami , Florida , directed by TAJ Stansberry . Two clips were filmed , one for the original song and one for the remix version . On the set of the video , Ludacris said , " It hasn ’ t been this many women on the same song or the same video set in ... I don ’ t know how long , so we making history and it feels damn good . " It premiered on February 19 , 2010 on BET 's 106 & Park and VEVO . 
 The video takes place in a lair / dungeon setting , as Ludacris is directing a movie but the filming is on break . During that time Ludacris begins to brag about his " girl " towards the other cast members . Later in the video Minaj is revealed as the actress of the film , portraying a Freddy Krueger character , complete with the trademark glove made of razor blades . She is found lying in a couch , held by restraints , before the video ends with Ludacris and Nicki performing in the lair . The remix video with Diamond , Trina and Eve , also directed by TAJ , premiered on March 26 , 2010 on VEVO and 106 & Park . The video is an extension of the original clip , featuring the same concept and premise .

 = Dolphinarium = 
 A dolphinarium is an aquarium for dolphins . The dolphins are usually kept in a large pool , though occasionally they may be kept in pens in the open sea , either for research or for public performances . Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public , others are part of larger parks , such as marine mammal parks , zoos or theme parks , with other animals and attractions as well . 
 While cetaceans have been held in captivity since the 1860s , the first commercial dolphinarium was opened only in 1938 . Their popularity increased rapidly until the 1960s . Since the 1970s , increasing concern for animal welfare led to stricter regulation , which in several countries ultimately resulted in the closure of some dolphinariums . Despite this trend , dolphinariums are still widespread in Europe , Japan and North America . 
 The most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums is the bottlenose dolphin , as it is relatively easy to train and has a long lifespan in captivity . While trade in dolphins is internationally regulated , other aspects of keeping dolphins in captivity , such as the minimum size and characteristics of pools , vary among countries . Though animal welfare is perceived to have improved significantly over the last few decades , many animal rights groups still consider keeping dolphins captive to be a form of animal abuse . 
 = = History = = 
 Though cetaceans have been held in captivity in both North America and Europe since the 1860s , the first being a pair of Beluga Whales in the New York museum , dolphins were first kept for paid entertainment in the Marine Studios dolphinarium founded in 1938 in St. Augustine , Florida . It was here that it was discovered that dolphins could be trained to perform tricks . Recognizing the success of Marine Studios , more dolphinariums began keeping dolphins for entertainment . In the 1960s , keeping dolphins in zoos and aquariums for entertainment purposes increased in popularity after the 1963 Flipper movie and subsequent Flipper television series . In 1966 , the first dolphin was exported to Europe . In these early days , dolphinariums could grow quickly due to a lack of legislation and lack of concern for animal welfare . 
 New legislation , most notably the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act in the United States , combined with a more critical view on animal welfare , forced many dolphinariums around the world to close . A prominent example is the United Kingdom ; in the early 1970s there were at least 36 dolphinariums and traveling dolphin shows , however , the last dolphinarium closed its doors in 1993 . The last dolphinarium in Hungary was closed in 1992 . In 2005 both Chile and Costa Rica prohibited keeping cetaceans captive . However , around 60 dolphinariums currently exist across Europe , of which 34 are within the EU . Japan , Mexico and the United States are also home to a relatively large number of dolphinariums . 
 = = Design = = 
 Many varied designs exist , but basic dolphinarium design for public performances often consists of stands for the public around a semi @-@ circular pool , sometimes with glass walls which allow underwater viewing , and a platform in the middle from which the trainers direct and present the show . 
 The water in the pools has to be constantly filtered to keep it clean for the dolphins and the spectators , and the temperature and composition of the water has to be controlled to match the conditions dolphins experience in the wild . In the absence of a common international regulation , guidelines regarding the minimum size of the pools vary between countries . To give an indication of pool sizes , the European Association for Aquatic Mammals recommends that a pool for five dolphins should have a surface area of 275 m2 ( 2 @,@ 960 sq ft ) plus an additional 75 m2 ( 810 sq ft ) for every additional animal , have a depth of 3 @.@ 5 m ( 11 ft ) and have a water volume of at least 1 @,@ 000 m3 ( 35 @,@ 000 cu ft ) with an additional 200 m3 ( 7 @,@ 100 cu ft ) for every additional animal . If two of these three conditions are met , and the third is not more than 10 % below standard , the <unk> considers the pool size to be acceptable . 
 = = Animals = = 
 = = = Species = = = 
 Various species of dolphins are kept in captivity as well as several other small whale species such as Harbour Porpoises , Finless Porpoises and Belugas , though in those cases the word dolphinarium may not be fitting as these are not true dolphins . Bottlenose Dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train , have a long lifespan in captivity and a friendly appearance . Hundreds if not thousands of Bottlenose Dolphins live in captivity across the world , though exact numbers are hard to determine . Orcas are well known for their performances in shows , but the number of Orcas kept in captivity is very small , especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins , with only 44 captive orcas being held in aquaria as of 2012 . Of all Orcas kept in captivity , the majority are located in the various SeaWorld parks in the United States . Other species kept in captivity are Spotted Dolphins , False Killer Whales , Pilot Whales and Common Dolphins , Commerson 's Dolphins , as well as Rough @-@ toothed Dolphins , but all in much lower numbers than the Bottlenose Dolphin . There are also fewer than ten , Amazon River Dolphins , Risso 's Dolphins , Spinner Dolphins , or <unk> in captivity . Two unusual and very rare hybrid dolphins known as Wolphins are kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii , which are a cross between a Bottlenose Dolphin and a False Killer Whale . Also two Common / Bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity : one at Discovery Cove and the other SeaWorld San Diego . 
 = = = Trade and capture = = = 
 In the early days , many Bottlenose dolphins were wild @-@ caught off the coast of Florida . Though the Marine Mammal Protection Act , established in 1972 , allows an exception for the collection of dolphins for public display and research purposes when a permit is obtained , Bottlenose dolphins have not been captured in American waters since 1989 . In most Western countries , breeding programs have been set up to provide the dolphinariums with new animals . To achieve a sufficient birth rate and to prevent inbreeding , artificial insemination ( AI ) is occasionally used . The use of AI also allows dolphinariums to increase the genetic diversity of their population without having to bring in any dolphins from other facilities . 
 The trade of dolphins is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( also known as the Washington Convention or CITES ) . Endangered dolphin species are included in CITES ’ Appendix I , in which case trade is permitted only in exceptional circumstances . Species considered not to be threatened with extinction are included in Appendix II , in which case trade “ must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival ” . Most cetacean species traded for display in captivity to the public or for use in swimming with dolphins and other interaction programs are listed on Appendix II . 
 However , live dolphins trade still continues . A live Bottlenose Dolphin is estimated to be worth between a few thousand to several tens of thousands of US dollars , depending on age , condition and prior training . Captures are reported to be on the rise in the South Pacific and the Caribbean , Cuba has also been an exporter of dolphins in recent years , this being organized by the Acuario Nacional de Cuba . In recent years , the Solomon Islands have also allowed the collection and export of dolphins for public display facilities . A 2005 law banned the export of dolphins , however , this ban was seemingly overturned in 2007 when some 28 dolphins were shipped to Dubai . Some , mainly Japanese , dolphinariums obtain their dolphins from local drive hunts , though several other countries in Asia also import dolphins from Japan . Several American dolphinariums had also done so . This practice was halted in 1993 , when the US National Marine Fisheries Service refused a permit for Marine World Africa USA to import four False Killer Whales caught in a Japanese drive hunt . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 = = = Animal welfare = = = 
 Many animal welfare groups such as the World Animal Protection consider keeping dolphins in captivity to be a form of animal abuse . The main arguments are that dolphins do not have enough freedom of movement in pools , regardless of pool size , ( in the wild , dolphins swim hundreds of miles every day ) and do not get enough stimulation . Dolphins often show repetitive behavior in captivity and sometimes become aggressive towards other animals or people . In some cases , the behavior of dolphins in captivity also results in their own death . 
 The lifespan of dolphins in captivity is another subject of debate . Research has shown that Orcas indeed have a much lower survival rate in captivity ; however , there is no significant difference between wild and captive survival rates for Bottlenose dolphins . This does not , however , reflect a global state of affairs : for example , Bottlenose dolphins in captive facilities in Jamaica suffer from extremely high mortality rates . 
 Some scientists suggest that the " unusually high " intelligence of dolphins means that they should be recognized as " non @-@ human persons " . In 2013 , the Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests prohibited the captivity of dolphins on these grounds , finding it " morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purpose " . 
 = Ocean Village Marina , Gibraltar = 
 The Ocean Village Marina is one of three marinas in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar , at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula . Formerly Sheppard 's Marina , it is located in the Bay of Gibraltar , between the North Mole of Gibraltar Harbour and the runway of Gibraltar International Airport . Both Ocean Village Marina and the adjacent Marina Bay have been incorporated into the Ocean Village Project , a luxury resort . 
 Ocean Village Marina and the adjacent Marina Bay together have 330 berths , with a draft ( or draught ) of 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) . The marina can accommodate vessels up to 90 metres ( 300 ft ) to 100 metres ( 330 ft ) in length . There are three residential towers with blue glass balconies overlooking the marina : Grand Ocean Plaza , Imperial Plaza , and Majestic Plaza . On 4 June 2012 , Ocean Village Marina hosted 161 vessels which formed the Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla , celebrating sixty years of the Queen 's reign .

 Gibraltar has three marinas : Marina Bay , Ocean Village Marina , and Queensway Quay Marina . Ocean Village Marina is located on Gibraltar 's Westside , outside the northern end of Gibraltar Harbour , in the Bay of Gibraltar , next to the airport runway . It is adjacent to Marina Bay which is just to its north . The marina forms part of the Ocean Village Project or Ocean Village Marina Complex , often referred to as just Ocean Village . Ocean Village Marina is the former Sheppard 's Marina or Sheppard 's Yard . Both Marina Bay and Ocean Village Marina have been incorporated into Ocean Village , between the North Mole and the airport runway . The strategic location of the marina offers protection from moisture @-@ laden <unk> winds . 
 = = History = = 
 Ocean Village Marina was formerly Sheppard 's Marina , owned by H. Sheppard & Co . By 2004 , the marina had been sold to Ocean Village Investments Ltd and demolition had commenced . The marina retained its original name , at least informally , for several years after the sale . The sale of Sheppard 's Marina was not without controversy , as some residents of the marina were eventually evicted from their berths by the new owners . After Ocean Village Investments acquired the adjacent Marina Bay in 2006 , both marinas were incorporated into Ocean Village , a resort with residential , retail , and leisure facilities . 
 On 4 June 2012 , the Ocean Village Marina hosted 161 vessels which formed the Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla , celebrating sixty years of the Queen 's reign . The flotilla took place one day after a similar event in London up the Thames . The festivities started officially with greetings from Gregory Butcher , founder of Ocean Village , and Ros <unk> , event organiser of Ocean Village . The Gibraltar Port Authority addressed those assembled on the topic of safety , and made recommendations regarding precautions which ranged from sunscreen to the distance between vessels . The flotilla departed from the marina at midday , sailing from the western side of the runway , passing Europa Point , and returning after reaching the eastern side of the runway . Boats up to 70 metres ( 230 ft ) participated in the flotilla . Small boats led the flotilla , followed by power boats over 9 metres ( 30 ft ) , and , finally , sailing vessels . The General Elliot , a Gibraltar Port Authority vessel , was at the head of the flotilla , and was supported by other official vessels .

 Ocean Village Marina and the adjacent Marina Bay together have 330 berths , with a draft of 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) . The marina can accommodate vessels up to 90 metres ( 300 ft ) to 100 metres ( 330 ft ) in length . The marina now offers premier berths , the majority of which are between 18 metres ( 59 ft ) and 25 metres ( 82 ft ) , although the largest can accommodate vessels up to 80 metres ( 260 ft ) in length . The Yacht Reporting Berth for Gibraltar closed in 2005 and customs clearance of vessels is now performed by the individual marinas . Each berth at Ocean Village Marina offers utilities which include metered water and electricity , as well as access to satellite television , telephone , fax , and Wi @-@ Fi . Other amenities include laundry and concierge services . Gasoline and diesel are available at the quayside . 
 In addition to the marina , the Ocean Village resort features three residential towers , with blue glass balconies , that also have commercial space : Grand Ocean Plaza , Imperial Plaza , and Majestic Plaza . Construction of a new World Trade Center in Ocean Village was scheduled to begin in 2012 . The development has a variety of restaurants , bars , and retail outlets , as well as executive office space . Leisure Island , on reclaimed land , has a business centre and casino , among other facilities . 
 Sheppard 's of Gibraltar , the former owner of the marina which was established in 1961 , still has a presence there . The business provides support services for yacht owners from both their chandlery and shipyard departments . Their chandlery shop on the ground floor of Marina Court at Ocean Village has a variety of products for yacht equipment and maintenance . Their shipyard on Coaling Island near Queensway Quay Marina performs repair services such as engine rebuilds , rigging , welding , and painting . Sheppard 's attends to yachts at all three of Gibraltar 's marinas , and also has a 40 @-@ ton lift when haul @-@ outs are needed . Their haul @-@ out work includes hull cleaning , replacement of anodes or transducers , and slurry blasting , among other services . Haul @-@ outs are performed at both Coaling Island and the North Mole . 
 = Self @-@ harm = 
 Self @-@ harm ( SH ) is defined as the intentional , direct injuring of body tissue , done without suicidal intentions . The term self @-@ harm means the same as self @-@ injury . These terms are used in the more recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology . The older literature , especially that which predates the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR ) , almost exclusively refers to self @-@ mutilation . 
 The most common form of self @-@ harm is skin @-@ cutting , but self @-@ harm also covers a wide range of behaviors including burning , scratching , banging or hitting body parts , interfering with wound healing ( <unk> ) , hair @-@ pulling ( <unk> ) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects . Behaviours associated with substance abuse and eating disorders are usually not considered self @-@ harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect . However , the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside the boundaries of self @-@ harm may indeed represent self @-@ harm if performed with explicit intent to cause tissue damage . Although suicide is not the intention of self @-@ harm , the relationship between self @-@ harm and suicide is complex , as self @-@ harming behaviour may be potentially life @-@ threatening . There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self @-@ harm to the extent that self @-@ harm is found in 40 – 60 % of suicides . However , <unk> self @-@ harmers to be suicidal is , in the majority of cases , inaccurate . 
 The desire to self @-@ harm is listed in the DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR as a symptom of borderline personality disorder . However , patients with other diagnoses may also self @-@ harm , including those with depression , anxiety disorders , substance abuse , eating disorders , post @-@ traumatic stress disorder , schizophrenia , and several personality disorders . Self @-@ harm is also apparent in high @-@ functioning individuals who have no underlying clinical diagnosis . The motivations for self @-@ harm vary and it may be used to fulfill a number of different functions . These functions include self @-@ harm being used as a coping mechanism which provides temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety , depression , stress , emotional numbness or a sense of failure or self @-@ loathing and other mental traits including low self @-@ esteem or perfectionism . Self @-@ harm is often associated with a history of trauma and abuse , including emotional and sexual abuse . There are a number of different methods that can be used to treat self @-@ harm and which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself . When self @-@ harm is associated with depression , antidepressant drugs and treatments may be effective . Other approaches involve avoidance techniques , which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities , or replacing the act of self @-@ harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage . 
 In 2013 about 3 @.@ 3 million cases of self @-@ harm occurred . Self @-@ harm is most common in adolescence and young adulthood , usually first appearing between the ages of 12 and 24 . Self @-@ harm in childhood is relatively rare but the rate has been increasing since the 1980s . However , self @-@ harm behaviour can nevertheless occur at any age , including in the elderly population . The risk of serious injury and suicide is higher in older people who self @-@ harm . Self @-@ harm is not limited to humans . Captive animals , such as birds and monkeys , are also known to participate in self @-@ harming behaviour . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Self @-@ harm ( SH ) , also referred to as self @-@ injury ( SI ) , self @-@ inflicted violence ( SIV ) , <unk> self injury ( NSSI ) or self @-@ injurious behavior ( SIB ) , refers to a spectrum of behaviors where demonstrable injury is self @-@ inflicted . The behavior involves deliberate tissue damage that is usually performed without suicidal intent . The most common form of self @-@ harm involves cutting of the skin using a sharp object , e. g. a knife or razor blade . The term self @-@ mutilation is also sometimes used , although this phrase evokes connotations that some find worrisome , inaccurate , or offensive . Self @-@ inflicted wounds is a specific term associated with soldiers to describe non @-@ lethal injuries inflicted in order to obtain early dismissal from combat . This differs from the common definition of self @-@ harm , as damage is inflicted for a specific secondary purpose . A broader definition of self @-@ harm might also include those who inflict harm on their bodies by means of disordered eating . 
 <unk> self injury ( NSSI ) was added to the DSM @-@ V as its own disorder , which distinguishes it from milder forms of self @-@ harm . This disorder occurs when a person is deliberately harming themselves in a physical way without the intent of committing suicide . Self @-@ harm without suicidal intent can be seen on a spectrum , just like many other disorders ( substance abuse , gambling addiction ) . Just like these other disorders , once the self harming behaviors cross a certain threshold , it then becomes classified as a mental health disorder . Criteria for NSSI include five or more days of self @-@ inflicted harm over the course of one year without suicidal intent , and the individual must have been motivated by seeking relief from a negative state , resolving an interpersonal difficulty , or achieving a positive state . 
 A common belief regarding self @-@ harm is that it is an attention @-@ seeking behavior ; however , in most cases , this is inaccurate . Many self @-@ harmers are very self @-@ conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behavior , leading them to go to great lengths to conceal their behavior from others . They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries , or conceal their scars with clothing . Self @-@ harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para @-@ suicidal behavior . People who self @-@ harm are not usually seeking to end their own life ; it has been suggested instead that they are using self @-@ harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress . Alternatively , interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self @-@ harm may not give clear indications as to its intent : life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent , whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt . 
 Studies of individuals with developmental disabilities ( such as intellectual disability ) have shown self @-@ harm being dependent on environmental factors such as obtaining attention or escape from demands . Some individuals may have dissociation harboring a desire to feel real or to fit into society 's rules . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Eighty percent of self @-@ harm involves stabbing or cutting the skin with a sharp object . However , the number of self @-@ harm methods are only limited by an individual 's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves ; this includes burning , self @-@ poisoning , alcohol abuse , self @-@ embedding of objects , hair pulling , bruising / hitting one 's self , scratching to hurt one 's self , knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs , and forms of self @-@ harm related to anorexia and bulimia . The locations of self @-@ harm are often areas of the body that are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others . As well as defining self @-@ harm in terms of the act of damaging the body , it may be more accurate to define self @-@ harm in terms of the intent , and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with . Neither the DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR nor the ICD @-@ 10 provide diagnostic criteria for self @-@ harm . It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder , though many people who self @-@ harm would like this to be addressed . 
 = = Cause = = 
 = = = Mental disorder = = = 
 Although some people who self @-@ harm do not have any form of recognised mental disorder , many people experiencing various forms of mental ill @-@ health do have a higher risk of self @-@ harm . The key areas of disorder which exhibit an increased risk include autism spectrum disorders , borderline personality disorder , bipolar disorder , depression , phobias , and conduct disorders . Schizophrenia may also be a contributing factor for self @-@ harm . Those diagnosed with schizophrenia have a high risk of suicide , which is particularly greater in younger patients as they may not have an insight into the serious effects that the disorder can have on their lives . Substance abuse is also considered a risk factor as are some personal characteristics such as poor problem @-@ solving skills and impulsivity . There are parallels between self @-@ harm and Münchausen syndrome , a psychiatric disorder in which individuals feign illness or trauma . There may be a common ground of inner distress culminating in self @-@ directed harm in a Münchausen patient . However , a desire to deceive medical personnel in order to gain treatment and attention is more important in Münchausen 's than in self @-@ harm . 
 = = = Psychological factors = = = 
 Abuse during childhood is accepted as a primary social factor increasing the incidence of self @-@ harm , as is bereavement , and troubled parental or partner relationships . Factors such as war , poverty , and unemployment may also contribute . Self @-@ harm is frequently described as an experience of <unk> or a dissociative state . As many as 70 % of individuals with borderline personality disorder engage in self @-@ harm .

 The most distinctive characteristic of the rare genetic condition , Lesch – Nyhan syndrome , is self @-@ harm and may include biting and head @-@ banging .

However , the link between genetics and self @-@ harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive . 
 = = = Drugs and alcohol = = = 
 Substance misuse , dependence and withdrawal are associated with self @-@ harm . Benzodiazepine dependence as well as benzodiazepine withdrawal is associated with self @-@ harming behaviour in young people . Alcohol is a major risk factor for self @-@ harm .

A recent study in the relation between cannabis use and deliberate self @-@ harm ( <unk> ) in Norway and England found that , in general , cannabis use may not be a specific risk factor for <unk> in young adolescents . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Self @-@ harm is not typically suicidal behaviour , although there is the possibility that a self @-@ inflicted injury may result in life @-@ threatening damage . Although the person may not recognise the connection , self @-@ harm often becomes a response to profound and overwhelming emotional pain that cannot be resolved in a more functional way . 
 The motivations for self @-@ harm vary , as it may be used to fulfill a number of different functions . These functions include self @-@ harm being used as a coping mechanism which provides temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety , depression , stress , emotional numbness and a sense of failure or self @-@ loathing . There is also a positive statistical correlation between self @-@ harm and emotional abuse . Self @-@ harm may become a means of managing and controlling pain , in contrast to the pain experienced earlier in the person 's life of which they had no control over ( e.g. , through abuse ) . 
 Other motives for self @-@ harm do not fit into <unk> models of behaviour and may seem incomprehensible to others , as demonstrated by this quotation : " My motivations for self @-@ harming were diverse , but included examining the interior of my arms for hydraulic lines . This may sound strange . " 
 Assessment of motives in a medical setting is usually based on precursors to the incident , circumstances , and information from the patient . However , limited studies show that professional assessments tend to suggest more manipulative or punitive motives than personal assessments . 
 The UK ONS study reported only two motives : " to draw attention " and " because of anger " . For some people , harming themselves can be a means of drawing attention to the need for help and to ask for assistance in an indirect way . It may also be an attempt to affect others and to manipulate them in some way emotionally . However , those with chronic , repetitive self @-@ harm often do not want attention and hide their scars carefully . 
 Many people who self @-@ harm state that it allows them to " go away " or dissociate , separating the mind from feelings that are causing anguish . This may be achieved by tricking the mind into believing that the present suffering being felt is caused by the self @-@ harm instead of the issues they were facing previously : the physical pain therefore acts as a distraction from the original emotional pain . To complement this theory , one can consider the need to " stop " feeling emotional pain and mental agitation . " A person may be hyper @-@ sensitive and overwhelmed ; a great many thoughts may be revolving within their mind , and they may either become triggered or could make a decision to stop the overwhelming feelings . " 
 Alternatively , self @-@ harm may be a means of feeling something , even if the sensation is unpleasant and painful . Those who self @-@ harm sometimes describe feelings of emptiness or numbness ( anhedonia ) , and physical pain may be a relief from these feelings . " A person may be detached from himself or herself , detached from life , numb and unfeeling . They may then recognise the need to function more , or have a desire to feel real again , and a decision is made to create sensation and ' wake up ' . " 
 Those who engage in self @-@ harm face the contradictory reality of harming themselves while at the same time obtaining relief from this act . It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting , but they often do because they know the relief that will follow . For some self @-@ harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain . <unk> are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury , act as natural painkillers , and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress . Many self @-@ harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self @-@ harming and , for some , deliberate self @-@ harm may become a means of seeking pleasure . 
 As a coping mechanism , self @-@ harm can become psychologically addictive because , to the self @-@ <unk> , it works ; it enables him or her to deal with intense stress in the current moment . The patterns sometimes created by it , such as specific time intervals between acts of self @-@ harm , can also create a behavioural pattern that can result in a wanting or craving to fulfill thoughts of self @-@ harm . 
 = = = Autonomic nervous system = = = 
 Everyone has a natural set point for their ability to experience stress . For some people , this is a very high threshold , whereas other people can become overwhelmed very quickly . Emotional pain activates the same regions of the brain as physical pain , so this can be a significantly intolerable state for some people . Some of this is environmental and some of this is due to physiological differences in responding . The autonomic nervous system is composed of two components : the sympathetic nervous system controls arousal and physical activation ( i. e. the fight @-@ or @-@ flight response ) and the parasympathetic nervous system controls physical processes that are automatic ( e.g. , saliva production ) . The sympathetic nervous system <unk> ( i.e. , is physically connected to and regulates ) many parts of the body involved in stress responses . Studies of adolescents have shown that adolescents who self @-@ injure have greater physiological reactivity ( i.e. , skin conductance ) to stress than adolescents who do not self @-@ injure . This stress response persists over time , staying constant or even increasing in self @-@ injuring adolescents , but gradually decreases in adolescents who do not self @-@ injure . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 There is considerable uncertainty about which forms of psychosocial and physical treatments of people who harm themselves are most effective . Psychiatric and personality disorders are common in individuals who self @-@ harm and as a result self @-@ harm may be an indicator of depression and / or other psychological problems . Many people who self @-@ harm have moderate or severe depression and therefore treatment with antidepressant medications may often be used . There is tentative evidence for the medication <unk> ; however , greater study is required before it can be recommended . 
 = = = Therapy = = = 
 There is no well @-@ established treatment for self @-@ injurious behavior in children or adolescents . Cognitive behavioural therapy may also be used to assist those with Axis I diagnoses , such as depression , schizophrenia , and bipolar disorder . Dialectical behaviour therapy ( DBT ) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder , and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self @-@ harming behaviour . Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self @-@ harm is thought by many to be the best approach to treating self @-@ harm . But in some cases , particularly in people with a personality disorder , this is not very effective , so more clinicians are starting to take a DBT approach in order to reduce the behaviour itself . People who rely on habitual self @-@ harm are sometimes hospitalised , based on their stability , their ability and especially their willingness to get help . In adolescents <unk> therapy shows promise . Treatments such as CBT , family intervention , interpersonal therapy , and various psychodynamic therapies were all shown to be possibly effective in treating self @-@ injurious behavior in children and adolescents . 
 A meta @-@ analysis found that psychological therapy is effective in reducing self @-@ harm . The proportion of the adolescents who self @-@ harmed over the follow @-@ up period was lower in the intervention groups ( 28 % ) than in controls ( 33 % ) . Psychological therapies with the largest effect sizes were dialectical behavior therapy ( DBT ) , cognitive @-@ behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , and mentalization @-@ based therapy ( MBT ) . 
 In individuals with developmental disabilities , occurrence of self @-@ harm is often demonstrated to be related to its effects on the environment , such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands . As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits , self @-@ harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way ( such as by asking ) . One approach for treating self @-@ harm thus is to teach an alternative , appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self @-@ harm . 
 = = = Avoidance techniques = = = 
 Generating alternative behaviours that the person can engage in instead of self @-@ harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self @-@ harm . Techniques , aimed at keeping busy , may include journaling , taking a walk , participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves . The removal of objects used for self @-@ harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self @-@ harming urges . The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self @-@ harm arise may also help prevent the act of self @-@ harm . Alternative and safer methods of self @-@ harm that do not lead to permanent damage , for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist , may also help calm the urge to self @-@ harm . Using biofeedback may help raise self @-@ awareness of certain pre @-@ occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self @-@ harming behaviour , and help identify techniques to avoid those pre @-@ occupations before they lead to self @-@ harm . Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual 's motivation and reason for harming . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 It is difficult to gain an accurate picture of incidence and prevalence of self @-@ harm . This is due in a part to a lack of sufficient numbers of dedicated research centres to provide a continuous monitoring system . However , even with sufficient resources , statistical estimates are crude since most incidences of self @-@ harm are undisclosed to the medical profession as acts of self @-@ harm are frequently carried out in secret , and wounds may be superficial and easily treated by the individual . Recorded figures can be based on three sources : psychiatric samples , hospital admissions and general population surveys . 
 The World Health Organization estimates that , as of 2010 , 880 @,@ 000 deaths occur as a result of self @-@ harm . About 10 % of admissions to medical wards in the UK are as a result of self @-@ harm , the majority of which are drug overdoses . However , studies based only on hospital admissions may hide the larger group of self @-@ harmers who do not need or seek hospital treatment for their injuries , instead treating themselves . Many adolescents who present to general hospitals with deliberate self @-@ harm report previous episodes for which they did not receive medical attention . In the United States up to 4 % of adults self @-@ harm with approximately 1 % of the population engaging in chronic or severe self @-@ harm . 
 Current research suggests that the rates of self @-@ harm are much higher among young people with the average age of onset between 14 and 24 . The earliest reported incidents of self @-@ harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old . In the UK in 2008 rates of self @-@ harm in young people could be as high as 33 % . In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self @-@ harm in college students than among the general population . In a study of undergraduate students in the US , 9 @.@ 8 % of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past . When the definition of self @-@ harm was expanded to include head @-@ banging , scratching oneself , and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning , 32 % of the sample said they had done this . In Ireland , a study found that instances of hospital @-@ treated self @-@ harm were much higher in city and urban districts , than in rural settings . The CASE ( Child & Adolescent Self @-@ harm in Europe ) study suggests that the life @-@ time risk of self @-@ injury is ~ 1 : 7 for women and ~ 1 : 25 for men . 
 = = = Gender differences = = = 
 In general , the latest aggregated research has found no difference in the prevalence of self @-@ harm between men and women . This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self @-@ harm . However , caution is needed in seeing self @-@ harm as a greater problem for females , since males may engage in different forms of self @-@ harm ( e.g. , hitting themselves ) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances . Hence , there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon , or merely the artifact of bias in data collection . 
 The WHO / EURO <unk> Study of Suicide , established in 1989 , demonstrated that , for each age group , the female rate of self @-@ harm exceeded that of the males , with the highest rate among females in the 13 – 24 age group and the highest rate among males in the 12 – 34 age group . However , this discrepancy has been known to vary significantly depending upon population and methodological criteria , consistent with wide @-@ ranging uncertainties in gathering and interpreting data regarding rates of self @-@ harm in general . Such problems have sometimes been the focus of criticism in the context of broader psychosocial interpretation . For example , feminist author Barbara Brickman has speculated that reported gender differences in rates of self @-@ harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and sampling errors , directly blaming medical discourse for <unk> the female . 
 This gender discrepancy is often distorted in specific populations where rates of self @-@ harm are inordinately high , which may have implications on the significance and interpretation of psychosocial factors other than gender . A study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self @-@ harm among 428 homeless and runaway youths ( aged 16 – 19 ) with 72 % of males and 66 % of females reporting a history of self @-@ harm . However , in 2008 , a study of young people and self @-@ harm saw the gender gap close , with 32 % of young females , and 22 % of young males admitting to self @-@ harm . Studies also indicate that males who self @-@ harm may also be at a greater risk of completing suicide . 
 There does not appear to be a difference in motivation for self @-@ harm in adolescent males and females . For example , for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self @-@ harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes , drugs and alcohol . <unk> factors such as low self @-@ esteem and having friends and family members who self @-@ harm are also common between both males and females . One limited study found that , among those young individuals who do self @-@ harm , both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin @-@ cutting . However , females who self @-@ cut are more likely than males to explain their self @-@ harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves . In New Zealand , more females are hospitalised for intentional self @-@ harm than males . Females more commonly choose methods such as self @-@ poisoning that generally are not fatal , but still serious enough to require hospitalisation . 
 = = = Elderly = = = 
 In a study of a district general hospital in the UK , 5 @.@ 4 % of all the hospital 's self @-@ harm cases were aged over 65 . The male to female ratio was 2 : 3 although the self @-@ harm rates for males and females over 65 in the local population were identical . Over 90 % had depressive conditions , and 63 % had significant physical illness . Under 10 % of the patients gave a history of earlier self @-@ harm , while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low , which could be explained by the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition , such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse . However , NICE Guidance on Self @-@ harm in the UK suggests that older people who self @-@ harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide , with 1 in 5 older people who self @-@ harm going on to end their life . A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self @-@ harm , but comparatively low rates of suicide . 
 = = = Developing world = = = 
 Only recently have attempts to improve health in the developing world concentrated on not only physical illness but also mental health . Deliberate self @-@ harm is common in the developing world . Research into self @-@ harm in the developing world is however still very limited although an important case study is that of Sri Lanka , which is a country exhibiting a high incidence of suicide and self @-@ poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons . Many people admitted for deliberate self @-@ poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die , but death was relatively common in the young in these cases . The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in the developing world is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality . 
 Some of the causes of deliberate self @-@ poisoning in Sri Lankan adolescents included bereavement and harsh discipline by parents . The coping mechanisms are being spread in local communities as people are surrounded by others who have previously deliberately harmed themselves or attempted suicide . One way of reducing self @-@ harm would be to limit access to poisons ; however many cases involve pesticides or yellow oleander seeds , and the reduction of access to these agents would be difficult . Great potential for the reduction of self @-@ harm lies in education and prevention , but limited resources in the developing world make these methods challenging . 
 = = = Prison inmates = = = 
 Deliberate self @-@ harm is especially prevalent in prison populations . A proposed explanation for this is that prisons are often violent places , and prisoners who wish to avoid physical confrontations may resort to self @-@ harm as a ruse , either to convince other prisoners that they are dangerously insane and resilient to pain or to obtain protection from the prison authorities . 
 = = History = = 
 Self @-@ harm is known to have been a regular ritual practice by cultures such as the ancient Maya civilization , in which the Maya priesthood performed auto @-@ sacrifice by cutting and piercing their bodies in order to draw blood . A reference to the priests of Baal " cutting themselves with blades until blood flowed " can be found in the Hebrew Bible . However , in Judaism , such self @-@ harm is forbidden under Mosaic law . 
 Self @-@ harm is also practised by the sadhu or Hindu ascetic , in Catholic mortification of the flesh , in ancient Canaanite mourning rituals as described in the Ras <unk> tablets and in the Shi 'ite annual ritual of self @-@ flagellation , using chains and swords , that takes place during Ashura where the Shi 'ite sect mourn the martyrdom of Imam Hussein . 
 The term " self @-@ mutilation " occurred in a study by L. E. Emerson in 1913 where he considered self @-@ cutting a symbolic substitution for masturbation . The term reappeared in an article in 1935 and a book in 1938 when Karl Menninger refined his conceptual definitions of self @-@ mutilation . His study on self @-@ destructiveness differentiated between suicidal behaviours and self @-@ mutilation . For Menninger , self @-@ mutilation was a non @-@ fatal expression of an attenuated death wish and thus coined the term partial suicide . He began a classification system of six types : 
 neurotic – nail @-@ biters , pickers , extreme hair removal and unnecessary cosmetic surgery . 
 religious – self @-@ <unk> and others . 
 puberty rites – hymen removal , circumcision or clitoral alteration . 
 psychotic – eye or ear removal , genital self @-@ mutilation and extreme amputation 
 organic brain diseases – which allow repetitive head @-@ banging , hand @-@ biting , finger @-@ fracturing or eye removal . 
 conventional – nail @-@ clipping , trimming of hair and shaving beards . 
 Pao ( 1969 ) differentiated between delicate ( low lethality ) and coarse ( high lethality ) self @-@ mutilators who cut . The " delicate " cutters were young , multiple episodic of superficial cuts and generally had borderline personality disorder diagnosis . The " coarse " cutters were older and generally psychotic . Ross and McKay ( 1979 ) categorized self @-@ mutilators into 9 groups : cutting , biting , <unk> , severing , inserting , burning , ingesting or inhaling and hitting and constricting . 
 After the 1970s the focus of self @-@ harm shifted from Freudian psycho @-@ sexual drives of the patients . 
 Walsh and Rosen ( 1988 ) created four categories numbered by Roman numerals I – IV , defining Self @-@ mutilation as rows II , III and IV . 
 <unk> and Rosenthal ( 1993 ) reviewed hundreds of studies and divided self @-@ mutilation into two categories : culturally sanctioned self @-@ mutilation and deviant self @-@ mutilation . <unk> also created two subcategories of sanctioned self @-@ mutilations ; rituals and practices . The rituals are mutilations repeated generationally and " reflect the traditions , symbolism , and beliefs of a society " ( p . 226 ) . Practices are historically transient and cosmetic such as piercing of earlobes , nose , eyebrows as well as male circumcision ( for non @-@ Jews ) while Deviant self @-@ mutilation is equivalent to self @-@ harm .

 = = = Awareness = = = 
 There are many movements among the general self @-@ harm community to make self @-@ harm itself and treatment better known to mental health professionals , as well as the general public . For example , March 1 is designated as Self @-@ injury Awareness Day ( <unk> ) around the world . On this day , some people choose to be more open about their own self @-@ harm , and awareness organizations make special efforts to raise awareness about self @-@ harm . Some people wear an orange awareness ribbon or wristband to encourage awareness of self @-@ harm . 
 = = Other animals = = 
 Self @-@ harm in non @-@ human mammals is a well @-@ established but not widely known phenomenon . Its study under zoo or laboratory conditions could lead to a better understanding of self @-@ harm in human patients . 
 Zoo or laboratory rearing and isolation are important factors leading to increased susceptibility to self @-@ harm in higher mammals , e.g. , macaque monkeys . Lower mammals are also known to mutilate themselves under laboratory conditions after administration of drugs . For example , pemoline , clonidine , amphetamine , and very high ( toxic ) doses of caffeine or theophylline are known to precipitate self @-@ harm in lab animals . 
 In dogs , canine obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder can lead to self @-@ inflicted injuries , for example canine lick granuloma . Captive birds are sometimes known to engage in feather @-@ plucking , causing damage to feathers that can range from feather shredding to the removal of most or all feathers within the bird 's reach , or even the mutilation of skin or muscle tissue . 
 Breeders of show mice have noticed similar behaviors . One known as " barbering " involves a mouse obsessively grooming the whiskers and facial fur off of themselves and cage @-@ mates . Other behaviors include scratching ears so severely , that large sections are lost . 
 = Epacris impressa = 
 Epacris impressa , also known as common heath , is a plant of the heath family , Ericaceae , that is native to southeast Australia ( the states of Victoria , Tasmania , South Australia and New South Wales ) . French botanist Jacques Labillardière collected the species in 1793 and described it in 1805 . Four forms have been identified , but no subspecies are recognised . Growing in heathland , shrubland or open forest , it is generally a small shrub around 0 @.@ 5 to 1 m ( 1 ft 8 in to 3 ft 3 in ) tall , with small stiff leaves . The red , pink or white tube @-@ like flowers appear from late autumn to early spring . Honeyeaters , particularly the eastern spinebill , feed upon the nectar of the flowers . It regenerates after bushfire by seed or by resprouting . 
 A highly regarded garden plant , the common heath was first cultivated in England in 1825 ; over seventy named cultivars have been developed , most of which have now vanished . A pink @-@ flowered form , often referred to as " pink heath " , is the floral emblem of the state of Victoria . Epacris impressa has proven a difficult plant to propagate reliably , which has limited its use in horticulture and revegetation . It grows best in well @-@ drained but moist soil in a <unk> position . 
 = = Description = = 
 Epacris impressa grows as a woody shrub with an erect habit , sometimes reaching 2 to 3 m ( 6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in ) in height although plants in the range of 0 @.@ 5 to 1 m ( 1 ft 8 in to 3 ft 3 in ) tall are more commonly observed . The branches are stiff and have small leaves with prickly , pointed apices that are 8 – 16 mm ( 3 ⁄ 8 – 5 ⁄ 8 in ) long . The flowers mainly occur between late autumn and early spring , arising in dense and sometimes pendulous clusters along the stems . White , pink or red in colour , they are 1 – 2 cm ( 3 ⁄ 8 – 3 ⁄ 4 in ) and are narrow and tubular with five indentations on the base . The corolla of the flower is formed by five petals , fused at the base to form a <unk> structure , with the free petal ends forming five lobes at the apex . There are five whorled sepals at the base of the corolla . Within the corolla is a central style that persists through development of the fruit . The style connects the stigma at the apex and ovary at the base , where the nectar is also located . Different colour forms are often observed growing near each other . The fruit is a 5 @-@ locule capsule that is about 3 @.@ 5 mm ( 1 ⁄ 8 in ) in diameter . It is globular in shape , sometimes with one end flattened . Initially green , it dries and splits , releasing numerous tiny seeds . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The type specimen of common heath was collected in 1793 by French botanist Jacques Labillardière in Van Diemen 's Land ( now Tasmania ) during a voyage with Antoine Bruni d 'Entrecasteaux . Labillardière described it in his 1805 work Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen , giving it its current name Epacris impressa . The Latin specific epithet impressa ( meaning " impressed " or " indented " ) alludes to the indentations on the floral tube . The original mounted specimen is currently held at the National Herbarium of Victoria at the Royal Botanic Gardens , Melbourne . 
 A number of specimens once described as separate species are now regarded as Epacris impressa , with no recognised subspecies . Scottish botanist Robert Brown described Epacris <unk> in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen alongside E. impressa . John Lindley described Epacris tomentosa from plant specimens collected during the third expedition of Thomas Mitchell in 1838 . Upon encountering Epacris impressa on Mount William in the Grampians , Mitchell remarked that it was " A most beautiful downy @-@ leaved Epacris with large , curved , purple flowers , allied to E. grandiflora but much <unk> " . Dr Robert Graham described Epacris <unk> ( which he spelt ceraeflora ) from plants cultivated at the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens in 1832 . The seed had come from Tasmania , the resulting progeny flowering over April and May 1832 . A year later , he described E. nivalis , which he called an " exceedingly beautiful species " , from specimens growing in Loddiges nursery . He also noted a form with long corollas that had been called E. variabilis that was in cultivation at the time , and noted it was difficult to describe the precise characteristics that distinguished E. ceraeflora , E. nivalis , E. variabilis and E. impressa . 
 In his landmark Flora Australiensis ( 1869 ) , George Bentham argued that several previously described species were in fact a single species – E. impressa , uniting E. variabilis , a short red @-@ flowered E. <unk> , E. <unk> , which had narrow leaves and long flowers , the white @-@ flowered E. nivalis , and short white @-@ flowered E. ceraeflora . He re @-@ classified as a separate species – E. <unk> – several plants that Allan Cunningham had collected in the Blue Mountains and classified as E. impressa . 
 In the same work , Bentham named and described two naturally occurring varieties , Epacris impressa var. grandiflora and E. impressa var. ovata . Plant specimens designated as grandiflora had been collected in the Wimmera , the Grampians ( including those previously designated as E. tomentosa ) and at Stawell in Victoria . Those classified as ovata were collected at Twofold Bay and Mount Imlay in southeastern New South Wales as well as <unk> and Rocky Cape in northern Tasmania . Bentham noted that , although variable , all forms had " five impressed cavities outside , alternating with the stamens immediately above the ovary . " 
 In his 1972 publication A Handbook to Plants in Victoria , Australian botanist Jim Willis expressed his view that dividing the species into subspecies was not feasible given that common heath is highly variable in flower colour and leaf shape , though he conceded the Grampians race grandiflora might be distinctive based on its larger corollas and coarser and hairier foliage . Currently , both grandiflora and ovata are regarded as synonyms of Epacris impressa rather than being classified as distinct varieties . The plant populations that best fit Bentham 's original description of grandiflora , also known as Grampians heath , occur naturally on sandstone at locations including Mount Zero , Mount <unk> and the Black Range . Other nearby populations are regarded as having intermediate characteristics , including those in the Victoria Range and Mount Arapiles . Although not recognised in the Australian Plant Census , the variety is noted as " rare " on the list of Advisory List of Rare or Threatened Plants in Victoria issued by the Department of Environment and Primary Industries .

 In 1977 Helen Stace and Yvonne Fripp from La Trobe University studied 195 populations of Epacris impressa in Victoria , South Australia and Tasmania and found that 120 consisted of mixed stands of two or more races while 75 populations were of one race only . They identified four races based on the following corolla characteristics : 
 white @-@ flowered with a markedly shortened corolla that is 9 – 12 mm ( 3 ⁄ 8 – 1 ⁄ 2 in ) long and red @-@ purple anthers , usually found in sites with greater sun exposure . Occurring throughout the species range , this form is the most widely distributed . 
 pink @-@ flowered , with a longer corolla that is 12 – 19 mm ( 1 ⁄ 2 – 3 ⁄ 4 in ) long and cream @-@ white anthers , in more shaded sites . This form occurs throughout the species range . Field work in Victoria and Tasmania found that pink @-@ flowered plants in mixed populations often have pink or red anthers . 
 long scarlet race , with orange @-@ red flowers and corolla 15 – 19 mm ( 5 ⁄ 8 – 3 ⁄ 4 in ) long and cream @-@ white anthers . Those from the granitic mountains of Wilsons Promontory and near W Tree in East Gippsland in Victoria flower between April and November . Other localities where this race has been recorded include the Howe Ranges and Clyde Mountain in New South Wales . 
 broad pink or white , the grandiflora race from the Grampians and Mount Arapiles in Victoria . Plants of this race are taller , often reaching 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) in height . White or pink colour bear no relation to corolla length . Plants from Mount Arapiles are always pink @-@ flowered . 
 The long @-@ pink and short @-@ white races frequently occur in close proximity to each other ; in these mixed populations the former tends to flower in winter and the latter in spring . The question has been raised whether these different forms are becoming incompatible . However , controlled cross @-@ pollination between plants with short and long corollas showed that there was no incompatibility between them . 
 Pink @-@ flowering populations have a relatively distinct genetic makeup , whereas red or white flowering populations have more evident sharing of genetic traits . Research based on DNA profiling has revealed substantial genetic diversity within and between flower colour races and site populations . This has implications for vegetation projects in that provenance material needs to be collected from a wide geographic area to maintain this diversity . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Epacris impressa is commonly found in coastal regions and nearby foothills , ranging from Kangaroo Island and the southern Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia across southern Victoria , extending to the Grampians and the Little Desert , and northwards to southern New South Wales as far as the Clyde River in the <unk> Range . It is also widespread in Tasmania . Plants are recorded at altitudes up to 1 @,@ 200 metres ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) at Mount Stradbroke and Mount <unk> in East Gippsland . The species grows in widely diverse habitats including sand and clay heathland , herb @-@ rich and <unk> woodland , lowland and shrubby dry forests , riparian thickets , montane rocky shrubland and rocky outcrops . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Honeyeaters such as the eastern spinebill are attracted to the flowers . As the bird gathers the nectar , the pollen , which has fins , attaches itself to the feathers on the heads of the birds and is carried to other flowers , aiding cross pollination . A study in forests near Hobart in Tasmania found that the eastern spinebill arrived in the area at the same time the common heath was in flower in March , and left once flowering had finished . Other honeyeaters , such as the strong @-@ billed , crescent and yellow @-@ throated honeyeaters , fed occasionally at common heath flowers . Field work in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia recorded the white @-@ plumed and New Holland honeyeaters , as well as the crescent honeyeater and the eastern spinebill . 
 Insects recorded visiting white @-@ flowered plants include the Australian painted lady ( Vanessa <unk> ) and yellow admiral ( V. <unk> ) , as well as bees . Field work in southern Tasmania showed that the introduced bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) sometimes robbed nectar by piercing the base of the tube . This then allowed honeybees ( Apis mellifera ) to retrieve nectar the same way . Epacris impressa is host to the scale insect <unk> <unk> . 
 A field study of the invasion of the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi into the Brisbane Ranges National Park in Victoria in 1971 indicated that Epacris impressa was moderately susceptible to the pathogen . Inoculation of seedlings confirmed this . Fieldwork in the Brisbane Ranges National Park in 1985 showed that there was some evidence that E. impressa seedlings were able to recolonise areas that had been infested with P. cinnamomi a decade before . 
 Epacris impressa regenerates after bushfire by seed and resprouting . Fieldwork in heathland in the Otway Ranges in the years following the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires showed that large numbers of E. impressa seedlings appeared in some areas , and that flowering took place as early as the second year after the fire . 
 The roots of Epacris impressa are colonized by fungi forming ericoid mycorrhiza . It is believed that the fungal species vary between regions . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Propagated from seed collected by William Baxter in southern Australia , common heath was introduced into cultivation in England by the Clapton Nursery in 1825 . Due to its frost @-@ tenderness , it was mostly restricted to greenhouse cultivation . In 1873 , a variety known as Epacris impressa alba was recorded as being grown commercially for cut flowers in Boston in the United States . While initially popular – over seventy cultivars appeared in the literature at the time – most have since disappeared . 
 Plants grow best in a moist but well @-@ drained , acidic soil , with added peat being helpful . They may be grown in coastal gardens in a sheltered position , and generally require some degree of shade . Once established , plants can tolerate short dry spells . As they age , plants may become straggly , but benefit from hard pruning after fertilizing and watering , which promotes compact , bushier growth . Common heath can be short @-@ lived and difficult to transplant , though it can be readily grown as a pot plant . Along with other members of the genus , Epacris impressa initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra . 
 Propagation both by seed and cuttings is difficult , reducing potential production by plant nurseries . Germination rates of soil @-@ stored seeds have been found to increase substantially with the application of heat and aqueous solutions of smoke . The most satisfactory results from cuttings can be achieved by using tip growth , taken six weeks after the cessation of flowering , and kept under a fogging system for twenty weeks . <unk> Neil Marriott recommends semi @-@ hardened cutting material taken in spring and autumn . Roots of cuttings are brittle and easily damaged .

 The following forms have been selected and grown for cultivation : 
 <unk> 
 This is a form from Bega in southern New South Wales that has bright red flowers and grows to 60 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) high . It is regarded as one of the more reliable forms in cultivation . <unk> and pink @-@ flowered forms from the same region also have horticultural potential . 
 <unk> Bells ' and other double @-@ flowered forms 
 <unk> Bells ' is a double @-@ flowered form with pink flower buds fading to white as they open . Registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1988 , it occurred naturally near the Royal Botanic Gardens Cranbourne in Victoria , but its habitat has since been cleared . A double @-@ flowered form of Epacris impressa was collected as early as the 1860s in Victoria when Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller sent a specimen to Kew Gardens . This was examined by botanist William Hemsley in 1865 . The specimen , labelled as Epacris impressa var. <unk> , originated from Stawell in western Victoria . Another specimen given the same name by Mueller was collected at <unk> , today a suburb of Melbourne . Charles French , co @-@ founder of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria , collected a white double @-@ flowered form from Cheltenham south of Melbourne in 1859 and a pink double @-@ flowered form from <unk> on the Mornington Peninsula in about 1862 . These were later sent as rooted cuttings to Veitch Nurseries in England . Double @-@ flowered forms of various colours have since been found throughout Victoria , but only single plants have been observed in any location , and they are still regarded as a rarity . A naturally occurring form of the variety grandiflora with rosebud @-@ like double flowers is also grown . 
 <unk> <unk> 
 A form with deep pink flowers on long spikes , ' Spring Pink ' appears in spring . It grows to 60 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) high .

 At a meeting of representatives of government and other bodies in 1951 it was agreed that the pink form of the common heath , the " pink heath " , be adopted as the official floral emblem for the state of Victoria . Victoria was the first Australian state to adopt a floral emblem . The proclamation , made on 11 November 1958 by Governor Dallas Brooks , was as follows : 
 I , the Governor of the State of Victoria , in the Commonwealth of Australia , by and with the advice of the Executive Council of the said State , do by this my Proclamation declare that the Pink Form of the Common Heath , Epacris impressa <unk> . , be adopted as the Floral Emblem for the State of Victoria " 
 An Australian stamp issue of state floral emblems was issued in 1968 , including the pink heath which was featured on the 13 cent stamp . In 2014 a 70 @-@ cent stamp labelled as " Common Heath " was issued . The pink heath is also depicted on the Victorian driver 's licence . In 1973 , a depiction of pink heath was added to the armorial bearings for Victoria .

 Ellie Victoria Cole was born in the Melbourne suburb of Lilydale on 12 December 1991 . Her mother and grandfather were both swimmers , and her father was athletic . At two years of age , she was diagnosed with a rare tumour , a sarcoma that was wrapped around the nerves of her right leg . After unsuccessful attempts to treat her cancer with chemotherapy , her right leg was amputated above the knee on 14 February 1994 . Eight weeks after the surgery , as part of her rehabilitation , Cole 's mother Jenny enrolled her in swimming lessons . Cole 's instructors expected her to take up to a year to learn how to swim in a straight line , but it took her two weeks . 
 Cole attended Mount Eliza North Primary school and Frankston High School , both in the outer Melbourne suburb of Frankston . As of 2015 she lives in Sydney and trains at the Castle Hill RSL Swim Club while she works towards a Bachelor of Sports Coaching and Exercise Science at the Australian Catholic University . She has a twin sister , Brittany .

 Cole is classified in the S9 category in swimming due to her amputation , a classification that also includes swimmers who have joint restrictions in one leg and those with double below @-@ knee amputations . She began competitive swimming in 2003 and , at the 2006 IPC Swimming World Championships in Durban , she won a silver medal in the women 's 100 m backstroke S9 event . Also in 2006 Cole won the 100 m backstroke at the Telstra Australian Swimming Championships . Cole qualified for the Australian Paralympic Swim Team in 2008 and , in the same year , attended the Beijing Paralympics where she won a silver medal in the Women 's 100 m Butterfly S9 event and bronze medals in the 400 m Freestyle and 100 m Backstroke events . 
 On 12 August 2009 Cole participated in the 100 m freestyle multi @-@ disability event in the 2009 Australian Short Course Swimming Championships in Hobart , where she broke the world record with a time of 1 : 04 : 06 . This championship is the qualifying event for the IPC Swimming World Championships , run by FINA , the international organization for swimming . The same year Cole participated in the 2009 IPC Swimming World Championships 25 m in Rio de Janeiro , where she won bronze medals in the 100 m backstroke , 400 m freestyle , 4 × 100 m freestyle relay and the 200 m individual medley . 
 In 2010 at the IPC Swimming World Championships in Eindhoven , Netherlands she won bronze medals in the women 's 200 m individual medley and 400 m freestyle S9 events . In that same year she won bronze medals in the 100 m Freestyle S9 and 100 m Butterfly S9 events at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi . At the 2011 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Edmonton , Alberta , Canada she won a total of six gold medals , emerging victorious in the women 's 50 m freestyle , 100 m freestyle , 400 m freestyle , 100 m butterfly , 100 m backstroke and 200 m individual medley S9 events . Cole has also participated in national championships such as the Australian Age Multi Class Swimming Championships and the New South Wales State Open championships . The former competition is held in Canberra at the Australian Institute of Sport and is designed to prepare elite swimmers for international competition . She then participated in the 2012 New South Wales State Open Championships in multi @-@ class events . 
 Cole was an Australian Institute of Sport Scholarship holder . Her coach , Graeme Carroll , trained her in Canberra in preparation for the 2012 London Paralympics with an approach that combined swim training with aerobics and gym work . She trained with Teigan Van Roosmalen , a blind and deaf S13 swimmer . Cole also mentors young athletes . When not in high school Cole was undertaking ten or more swimming sessions a week but , while at school , she reduced her load . As of 2015 , her coach is Nathan Doyle . 
 At the 2012 London Paralympics , Cole participated in eight events and won six medals . In her first event , the 100 m Butterfly S9 , she finished fourth , while South Africa 's Natalie du Toit finished first . However , the following night , Cole won the 100 m Backstroke S9 , winning her first gold medal of the games in Australian record time . She told the press that it had " been a goal of mine ever since I was 12 years old to beat Natalie du Toit " who was " kind of like the Michael Phelps of swimming for me , she has been a great mentor and relaxes me in the marshalling room . She is my biggest hero . " Cole won a second gold medal in the 4 x 100 m freestyle relay 34 pts , this time in World Record time . In the 400 m Freestyle S9 , she was again beaten by du Toit , who finished first , while Cole took bronze . Cole won a second bronze in the 50 m Freestyle S9 , in which du Toit finished seventh , and then gold in the 100 m Freestyle S9 , in which du Toit finished third . Cole capped off the games , surprising even herself with a fourth gold medal , in the 4 x 100 m freestyle relay 34 pts , again in Australian record time . 
 After the London Paralympics , she underwent two shoulder reconstructions that threatened her swimming career . At the 2015 IPC Swimming World Championships , she won gold medals in the Women 's 100 m Backstroke S9 breaking the world record in the heats and final , Women 's 100 m Freestyle S9 and Women 's 4 x 100 m Freestyle Relay 34 points , a silver medal in the Women 's 4 × 100 m Medley Relay and a bronze medal in the Women 's 50 m Freestyle S9 . 
 Cole became the first S9 swimmer to break 29 seconds in the 50m freestyle in winning the gold medal at the 2016 Australian Swimming Championships in Adelaide in the 50m Freestyle <unk> event . Her time of 28 @.@ 75 broke Natalie du Toit 's world record of 29 @.@ 04 .

" I definitely wanted a new challenge because when you 've been competing for a decade the increments of improvements are quite small . However , in wheelchair basketball I knew that I could make big improvements . I 've been chosen for the women 's national league team , which is great , so I 'm actually getting somewhere , which is a surprise .

 <unk> ( <unk> , chikaraishi , lit . " strength stones " ) ( also <unk> @-@ ishi ( <unk> , " weighing stones " ) or <unk> ( Okinawan ) ) are heavy rocks used at least since the 8th century CE in Japan to develop or demonstrate physical strength . Commonly found within Shinto shrines , they were used for competition , divination , physical fitness and entertainment ; some famous examples have also become tourist attractions , and many have been recognised as Important Cultural Assets by the Japanese Government . 
 Competitive stone @-@ lifting is still continued in modern times , and a number of competitive forms of stone @-@ lifting exist , employing different physical techniques . 
 = = History = = 
 Strength @-@ stones are found throughout Japan , often at Shinto shrines . In 2005 around 14 @,@ 000 strength @-@ stones were recorded in shrines around Japan . Of these , around 300 are designated as Important Cultural Assets . Many are inscribed with the names and feats of those who lifted them . The oldest @-@ known inscribed stone is from Shinobu , and dates to 1664 . The first recorded incidence of strength @-@ stone lifting is attributed to the samurai Kamakura <unk> <unk> in 1089 , however the practice itself is much older , dating to before the 8th century . The Nippo Jisho , also called the <unk> da <unk> de <unk> , a Japanese – Portuguese dictionary published in 1603 , includes the term chikaraishi in the written record as early as the 17th century . The Nippo Jisho , published in Nagasaki and associated with the Jesuit priest João Rodrigues ( 1561 or 1562 – 1633 ) , identically records both the modern pronunciation and written form of the term <unk> 
 It is one of the few traditional sports not solely the preserve of the samurai class , being popular among peasants and sake brewers . Both professions valued the manual labor of young people , and similar practices called <unk> also existed , which involved lifting sacks of rice or barrels of sake . The sporting aspect of stone @-@ lifting developed in Edo around the seventeenth century , likely evolving from the sack @-@ lifting contests of the stevedores and labourers . Historically , the lifting of strength @-@ stones was exclusively practiced by men . 
 The practice of lifting strength @-@ stones was especially popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries ( roughly coinciding with the Meiji period ) , with organised competitions occurring . Stones used in competition were usually inscribed with their weight , measured in kan ( <unk> ) ( a unit of approximately 3 @.@ 75 kg ( 8 lb ) ) , and if not naturally smooth , were often sculpted into a roughly oval shape . 
 Some strength @-@ stones have become tourist attractions due to the legends attached to them . In <unk> , for example , tourists still visit Sobei 's Horse @-@ Headed Kannon Stone , a strength @-@ stone associated with the tale of Kato Sobei from 1840 . According to the story , Sobei was awarded possession of a heavy stone that he managed to lift . However , his horse collapsed and died under the weight of the stone , and in its memory , he erected the stone as the horse 's grave marker . Another famous stone is the Benkei @-@ ishi , a huge rock supposedly moved from present @-@ day Himeji , Hyōgo , Hyōgo Prefecture to its current resting place on Mount <unk> by the folk hero Benkei ( 1155 – 1189 ) . The Benkei @-@ ishi can be viewed at <unk> @-@ ji , high above Himeji . 
 = = Purpose = = 
 A general lack of recorded evidence makes it difficult to ascertain the intended purpose of stone @-@ lifting . It has been assumed that the practice was for competition , physical fitness or entertainment purposes ( sumo wrestlers have been known to perform such feats between bouts for the entertainment of their audience ) . Records of competition techniques and winners ( such as the 1836 list of " Men of Strength in Edo " , which ranks competitors by weights lifted ) indicate a competitive aspect . 
 Strength @-@ stones are used in modern times for strength training , particularly in the martial arts where such practices are known as <unk> <unk> . Special stones are manufactured for this purpose , usually with a wooden handle to aid their manipulation ; such stones are also known as chi ishi . It is a common practice in karate , used in solo training to improve stances and upper body strength . 
 = = = In divination = = = 
 The prevalence of the stones in Shinto shrines and temples has led to speculation that rock @-@ lifting was used for divining the future , a practice known as ishi @-@ ura ( <unk> ) . The ease with which a petitioner lifted the stones indicated the likelihood of his preferred outcome occurring . Ishi @-@ ura was notably practiced in ancient Shinano Province , now modern @-@ day Nagasaki Prefecture . Smaller versions of these stones were sometimes placed by a child 's bed , in the belief that this would strengthen the child . 
 = = = As a sport = = = 
 Several forms of competition were employed in stone @-@ lifting , each sometimes using a particular type of stone . <unk> ( <unk> , " various stones " ) was the simplest form , requiring competitors to hoist a rock of about 70 kg ( 154 lb ) , known as a <unk> @-@ ishi ( <unk> ) , from the ground to above the head . It was permissible for participants to pause and readjust their grip once the rock was at chest height . <unk> ( <unk> , " shoulder carried stone " ) contests required that the stone be lifted to the shoulder ; this form employed heavier rocks ( up to 240 kg ( 529 lb ) ) , known as a <unk> @-@ ishi ( <unk> ) , and allowed the use of a rope wrapped around the stone . In <unk> ( <unk> , " stone carrying " ) competitions , the aim was to carry the stone as far as possible , the winner naturally being the man who carried it the greatest distance , whilst <unk> ( <unk> , " foot receiving " ) contests featured extremely heavy stones that were lifted with the feet by competitors lying on their backs . Rocks that were too heavy to be lifted clear of the ground were employed in <unk> ( <unk> , " stone raising " ) , using a type of stone called the <unk> @-@ ishi ( <unk> ) , the aim of which was to raise a stone so that it was balanced on its edge . 
 Stone @-@ lifting contests still take place in the modern era . The city of <unk> , Okayama hosts an annual competition in which local teams participate .

 = George Balabushka = 
 George Balabushka ( Russian : <unk> <unk> <unk> Grigoriy <unk> Balabushka ; December 9 , 1912 – December 5 , 1975 ) was a Russian @-@ born billiards ( pool ) cue maker , arguably the most prominent member of that profession , and is sometimes referred to as " the Stradivarius of cuemakers " . His full name or last name standing alone is often used to refer to a cue stick made by him . Arriving in the U.S. in 1924 , he worked at various carpentry and toy and furniture making jobs . He was an avid pool player and purchased a pool room with a business partner in 1959 and thereafter started making cues as gifts for friends which quickly blossomed into a business when others wanted to purchase them . 
 Balabushka turned out approximately 1 @,@ 200 handcrafted cues during his 16 @-@ year cue @-@ making career , spanning from 1959 to his death in 1975 . His cues are highly valued collectors items , made more so after being prominently featured in Martin Scorsese 's 1986 film , The Color of Money . Balabushka cues are generally separated into three distinct classes and time periods related to what blanks Balabushka was using in cue construction : The Titlist blank era ( 1959 – 1966 ) , the Burton Spain blank era ( 1966 – 1971 ) and the Gus Szamboti blank era ( 1971 – 1975 ) . Original Balabushka cues with verified provenance may realize tens of thousands of dollars at auction .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 George Balabushka was born in Russia on December 9 , 1912 and immigrated to the United States in 1924 at 12 years of age . His family , parents Anton and Natalie and younger sister Mary , settled in New York City . Although originally named Gregori , according to Balabushka he was given a new first name , George , by immigration officials when he was processed through Ellis Island . 
 = = = Employment = = = 
 Balabushka 's first job was as a wooden toy designer and maker , working for the Educational Equipment Company , then located at 71 West 23rd St. , in Manhattan , which made building blocks for nurseries and schools . Thereafter he built children 's furniture for the Playtime <unk> Company located on Greenwich Village 's Jane Street . While on the job , Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw . Using a wooden mold , he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident . As Balabushka 's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time . In 1949 , Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented , which was granted in 1951 . 
 = = = Marriage and children = = = 
 While working at Playtime <unk> he met a woman named Josephine , his future wife , who then lived directly across the street from the toy company . They were married in 1941 , and bought a home in Brooklyn several years later . Josephine and George had two sons , Gregory and George , both named after their father . 
 Josephine was not just a source of love and stability but was the rock that allowed Balabushka the ability to hone his craft . According to the writers of the The Billiard Encyclopedia , " Josephine 's limitless patience and strong sense of independence would afford George the time and solitude necessary that a great artist needs in order to perfect his craft . " 
 = = = Transition to cuemaker = = = 
 Balabushka was an avid billiards player , especially of the game of straight pool , taking part in competitions and spending time with well @-@ known practitioners of the sport . In 1959 , he purchased a Brooklyn @-@ based pool hall with partner , Frank McGown , which was located at 50th Street and 5th Avenue . While running the room , he began repairing cues as a hobby , and soon the idea was sparked to design and manufacture his own line of pool cues . 
 By the end of 1959 , Balabushka had made a number of cues , most of which were given to friends as Christmas gifts . As this practice went on , he began receiving orders for his cues . His first cues were conversions of the popular Brunswick @-@ Balke @-@ Collender Company manufactured " Titlist " cues , which were one @-@ piece cues ; that is , they had no joint in the middle that would allow a player to break down the cue into two sections for ease of transport . At the time he started , there were very few private cuemakers , the industry being dominated by large manufacturers . 
 = = = <unk> career and death = = = 
 Between 1959 and 1962 , Balabushka handcrafted between 20 and 30 cues per year on a part @-@ time basis . Because of the relative dearth of private cuemakers and the excellence of his product , Balabushka 's name quickly became known amongst professional players . By the end of 1962 , Balabushka was receiving more orders for cues than he could fill given his time constraints . Balabushka accordingly sold his interest in the pool room , converted his garage into a carpentry shop , and by 1964 was building cues full @-@ time , while continuing to hone his <unk> abilities . 
 Unlike many of the large manufacturers of the day , Balabushka 's emphasis was on playing ability and fine craftsmanship , reflecting the values he had held during his years in the woodworking business . He was an innovator in cue construction , cue finishes and cue design . Balabushka 's cues were not the elaborately decorated attempts at building art that became a mainstay of the cue market starting in the 1980s and onward . Rather , most Balabushka cues are relatively plain and without grand ornamentation flourishes . Many of his trademark construction techniques have become standard in the industry , such as the use of Irish linen for wrap material and block style checkered @-@ pattern ringwork above a cue 's wrap , commonly employing alternating ebony and ivory , pieces which are eponymously named " Bushka rings . " 
 George Balabushka died in 1975 at the age of 62 . He was posthumously honored as the first inductee into the American <unk> Association Hall of Fame in February , 1993 . In 2004 , he was inducted into the Meritorious Service category of the Billiard Congress of America 's Hall of Fame . 
 = = Cue details = = 
 There are three distinct classes of cues produced during different time periods related to what blanks Balabushka was using in cue construction : The Titlist blank era ( 1959 – 1966 ) , the Burton Spain blank era ( 1966 – 1971 ) and the Gus Szamboti blank era ( 1971 – 1975 ) . The " blanks " referred to are the bottom ( butt ) portion of a cue where the splicing of various hardwoods has been completed but the cue has not yet been turned on a lathe to produce the final shape , and certain features have not yet been added such as a wrap , joint mechanism , butt cap , bumper and any inlays . 
 While blank variety is the defining demarcation between one Balabushka cue and another , there are some shared features spanning Balabushka 's fleeting 16 @-@ year career . Cue forearms were characteristically made with straight @-@ grained maple , based on Balabushka 's belief that a single @-@ direction maple grain provided superior integrity to that of curly maple or <unk> maple . He used stainless steel joints and <unk> butt caps almost exclusively . A small number of his cues feature ivory joints and ivory butt caps , making them highly valued collector 's items . Balabushka used a distinguishing reddish @-@ brown bumper , and employed Cortland Irish linen for many of his wraps , with the highly sought after leather wrap a rare departure for him and a distinct value enhancer . Unless a different length was specified , Balabushka made all his cues to a standard 57 ½ inches in length . 
 In addition to Bushka rings , various other decorative rings were commonly incorporated , including various colored plastics ( often marbleized ) , and silver and contrasting wooden rings . For decoration , Balabushka often inlaid small mother @-@ of @-@ pearl dots and notched diamonds . Series of window @-@ shaped maple pieces commonly adorned Balabushka butt sleeves , with each window usually featuring one <unk> for its aesthetic effect . Some other features common to many other cuemakers ' lines from the same era are notably absent or mostly absent from Balabushka 's , including ivory inlays and the signing of his cues . A long @-@ standing controversy exists over what finish Balabushka used . One side argues that he used an oil finish on all his cues , while the other insists that his later cues were coated with a spray lacquer . 
 = = = Titlist era = = = 
 When Balabushka first started repairing cues while working at his pool room , he started converting house cues into custom cues . Many of these house cues were made by Brunswick . When he started building his own cues in 1959 , he used blanks purchased from Brunswick for their " Titlist " cue line ; the same used in the construction of the house cues he had been converting . Many of the fine cuemakers working during the same era as Balabushka did likewise , including Frank Paradise ( Paradise cues ) , Eugene <unk> ( Palmer cues , named after Arnold Palmer ) and Ernie Gutierrez ( <unk> ) , all following in the footsteps of earlier master cuemaker , Herman <unk> . 
 Building a full spliced blank from scratch was an expensive and painstaking process , and the large manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks , with beautiful points , veneers and sound construction . In Balabushka 's case , his entire workshop consisted of a single lathe and other woodworking equipment in the confines of his modest garage , and building his own full @-@ splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and expensive for him . 
 = = = Burton Spain era = = = 
 Balabushka used Titlist blanks until 1966 when he was contacted by Chicagoan Burton Spain . Spain had recently begun making handmade spliced blanks and was supplying them to Balabushka 's closest rival , Frank Paradise . Spain had become fascinated by splicing technology when he came upon a Titlist cue split down the middle in 1965 and set out to perfect and even improve on the Titlist splice . Spain 's original intent was to be predominantly a cuemaker in his own right using his proprietary spliced blanks . However , by 1966 Spain 's superior blanks were in high demand and he instead turned to making blanks for other cuemakers full @-@ time , which he continued until 1970 . 
 Balabushka took Spain up on his offer after seeing the quality of his splices . Buying from Spain also had the advantage that he was able to have Spain customize the blanks to his specifications . During this period Balabushka began incorporating more elaborate details into his cues , including the eponymous Bushka rings innovation . Many later cuemakers would install Bushka rings both above the wrap and on the butt sleeve below the wrap . Balabushka used them only above the wrap , which is believed to have aided him in keeping the balance point higher on the cue . In 1970 , Spain sold his cue business to tool and die maker John Davis , who had been assisting Spain for a number of years . Balabushka continued buying blanks from Davis until 1971 . 
 = = = Gus Szamboti era = = = 
 In 1971 , Balabushka met <unk> , Pennsylvania native Gus Szamboti at a tournament . Szamboti had been working for RCA as a draftsman and designer , but RCA layoffs were common at the time , and he had started designing and selling pool cues as a more stable job path . Though he too started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by <unk> of Chicago , Szamboti later began making his own . Balabushka was very impressed with Szamboti 's blanks and , in addition to the two men becoming fast friends , he became Szamboti 's first customer , buying blanks from him for $ 18 apiece . 
 Balabushka cues from the Gus Szamboti era are typified by straight grained maple forearms bearing four ebony points , with four veneers included , normally colored black , green , white and mahogany , or sometimes with an orange veneer in place of mahogany . Balabushka cues from this era , spanning the last five years of his life , are considered the finest of his career as a class . There have been unconfirmed rumors that some few cues made during this period included splices made by Balabushka himself . 
 = = Prominence = = 
 It is estimated that Balabushka produced between 1 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 200 cues during his lifetime . However , by the mid @-@ 1960s , forged Balabushka cues started circulating in the market , as he was already recognized as the premier cue maker of the era , referred to as " the Stradivarius of cuemakers " . Balabushka and his cues achieved much wider recognition after being prominently featured in Martin Scorsese ’ s 1986 film , The Color of Money ( the sequel to the classic 1961 film The Hustler ) . 
 In the film , Tom Cruise ’ s character , Vincent Lauria , is presented with a beautiful cue by Paul Newman 's character , Fast Eddie Felson . Vincent takes the cue , his reverence obvious , and is told by Eddie " it 's a Balabushka . " After this , Balabushka 's name became associated by the general public with highly valued and rare cues . The cue actually used in the film was , however , not a genuine Balabushka , but a Joss Cues model J @-@ 18 ( renamed the N @-@ 07 ) , custom @-@ made to look like a Balabushka . The filmmakers feared that any cue used might get damaged during filming ; especially in light of a scene set in a pool room where Cruise 's character rapidly whirls the cue around in time to the song Werewolves of London . An original Balabushka was thus considered too valuable to be risked in the production . 
 Original Balabushka cues with verified provenance may realize tens of thousands of dollars at auction . In 1994 , for example , a Balabushka was purchased by a collector for $ 45 @,@ 000 . In a 1998 Syracuse Herald @-@ Journal article a collection of thirty original <unk> cues and six Gus Szamboti cues was estimated to be worth 2 million dollars , the cues said to be the equivalent in the cue collecting world of Rembrandts and van <unk> respectively . There are , however , many fake Balabushka cues in existence . Complicating matters , in the 1980s with the permission and license of his surviving family , a line of Balabushka replicas began to be manufactured in large quantities by the Adam Custom Cue Company . 
 = Bill Szymczyk = 
 William Frank " Bill " Szymczyk ( / <unk> / ; born February 13 , 1943 ) is an American music producer and technical engineer best known for working with rock and blues musicians , most notably the Eagles in the 1970s . He produced many top albums and singles of the 1970s , though he retired from the music business by 1990 . He re @-@ emerged in the late 2000s , taking on select projects including the 2007 Eagles album Long Road Out of Eden and the 2008 eponymous debut of Brian Vander Ark . 
 Unlike many music producers , Szymczyk has no background as a musician . He was originally a sonar operator for the U.S. Navy and took some audio production classes as part of his Navy training . Besides his work with the Eagles , he has produced hit songs and albums for such diverse artists as B.B. King , Joe Walsh , The James Gang , and Elvin Bishop . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bill Szymczyk was born in Muskegon , Michigan on February 13 , 1943 . His mother worked as a nurse , and his father held several jobs , including factory worker and maintenance at a school . Growing up , his first introduction to music and electronics was when he built his own crystal radio from a kit . Using his radio , he became a fan of blues and R & B while listening to a station out of Nashville , Tennessee . 
 He joined the United States Navy in 1960 , where he worked as a sonar technician . It was in the Navy that he took his first course in radio and television production . Upon leaving the service in 1964 , and without much of an idea of what to do for a post @-@ military career , he enrolled at New York University 's Media Arts School . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 Bill Szymczyk began working at a firm which produced demo recordings for Screen Gems Records and worked extensively with Brill Building songwriters such as Carole King and Gerry Goffin . He also worked as an assistant to music producers and songwriters Quincy Jones and Jerry Ragovoy , eventually working his way up to chief engineer at <unk> 's Hit Factory recording studio . His first work as the primary producer on an album came for a Harvey Brooks solo record . He dropped out of NYU to work full @-@ time in the music industry . 
 He left the Hit Factory and took a job at ABC Records , taking a large pay cut in exchange for the opportunity to move from engineer to producer . He successfully lobbied ABC to let him work with B. B. King , whose own record label was a subsidiary of ABC and who was a long time idol of Szymczyk 's . After convincing King that he could improve his sound to make him more appealing to a wider audience , King himself agreed to let Szymczyk produce for him . Among the albums he produced for King are the 1969 live album Live & Well , King 's first ever top @-@ 100 album . He produced his follow @-@ up studio album Completely Well , which featured " The Thrill Is Gone " , the biggest hit of King 's career and his signature song . He would continue to produce blues albums throughout the early 1970s for the likes of King and Albert Collins . 
 Szymczyk was moved several times while working for ABC Records ; first to Los Angeles when ABC acquired Dunhill Records and Szymczyk took over production for the West Coast operations , and later to Denver when he decided to form his own label , Tumbleweed Records . He worked for a while as a disc jockey at radio station <unk> , and continued to produce albums in New York and Los Angeles , such as the J. Geils Band 's 1971 album The Morning After , recorded at the Los Angeles Record Plant . He did extensive work at the Colorado studio Caribou Ranch , where would be the center of his operations for the rest of the 1970s . 
 After producing the James Gang 's first three albums , he followed singer @-@ guitarist Joe Walsh when he left the band , first as a solo artist with the Szymczyk @-@ produced albums Barnstorm ( the first recorded at the Caribou Ranch studio ) and The Smoker You Drink , the Player You Get and later with the Eagles . His most prolific collaborations have been with Walsh ; the two have made over 15 albums together in many settings . Walsh himself moved to Boulder , Colorado in 1971 in order to work with Szymczyk and the location would inspire one of Walsh 's biggest solo hits , 1973 's " Rocky Mountain Way " . Besides work with Walsh in his band The James Gang and as a solo @-@ artist , he also brought Walsh in to work on several albums he was doing with other musicians , using him as a session player for the B. B. King album Indianola Mississippi Seeds and the Michael Stanley album Friends and Legends . It was at Szymczyk 's suggestion that the Eagles bring in Walsh to give them a " rock " edge ; Walsh remains a core member of the band to this day . 
 His long relationship with the Eagles began with their 1974 album On the Border , an album he took over from London @-@ based producer Glyn Johns . He would be the sole producer for the next three Eagles studio albums , including 1976 's Hotel California , the first to feature Joe Walsh . Szymczyk was instrumental in giving the Eagles a more " rock sound " and helping them to move away from their country rock roots . 
 Among the other acts he worked with extensively through the 1970s include Michael Stanley and the The J. Geils Band . While working with The Outlaws , he coined the term " Guitar Army " to describe the band 's sound ; the name continues as a nickname for the band . He worked in the studio for the Edgar Winter Group 's biggest hit , the Rick Derringer @-@ produced " Frankenstein " , and later produced Derringer 's best known solo album All American Boy and its hit single , " Rock and Roll , Hoochie Koo " . At the start of the 1980s he was a highly sought @-@ after producer , and worked on such albums as Bob Seger 's 1980 album Against the Wind and The Who 's 1981 release Face Dances . During this time period , Szymczyk produced such hit singles as Elvin Bishop 's " Fooled Around and Fell in Love " , The Who 's " You Better You Bet " , The Eagles ' " Hotel California " , and Bob Seger 's " Against the Wind " . 
 His workload tailed off in the mid @-@ 1980s , due mostly to his own financial success . He officially retired from the music industry in 1990 , but re @-@ emerged in 2005 , producing Dishwalla 's self @-@ titled fourth album . He returned to work with the Eagles on the 2007 album Long Road Out of Eden , and followed that with the 2008 solo debut of ex @-@ Verve Pipe singer Brian Vander Ark . 
 He now lives in Little Switzerland , North Carolina with his wife , Lisi Szymczyk . The couple has two sons , Michael and Daniel , and have become involved in their local community , having raised money for a local shelter for victims of domestic violence , among other charity work . He still works as a producer , but is more selective about projects he works on . 
 = = Production style = = 
 Bill Szymczyk 's has frequently been noted as the sort of producer who pushes bands to expand their musical horizons ; he has been brought in with the specific intent of changing a band 's sound . He himself has credited this tendency to his lack of musical knowledge , stating : " I 'm a professional listener . I listen and I react . I never was a musician , so I don 't bring any preconceived prejudices to the table ; I don 't favour the guitar over the keyboard , and so forth . I just listen and try to figure out if I have anything I can bring to a song . " 
 For his work with the Eagles , he has been cited for his innovative mixing of drums , laboriously working to get the right microphones and placements for just the right sound . Rather than recording harmony vocals individually , and mixing them together later , as was common , Szymczyk preferred to capture the Eagles singing in ensemble , often spending many hours to record each phrase " just right " . 
 For the Elvin Bishop hit , " Fooled Around and Fell in Love , " it was Szymczyk who suggested the inclusion of the song on Bishop 's Struttin ' My Stuff album , feeling the blues @-@ oriented album lacked a pop single . The song would go on to become Bishop 's biggest hit . Such a pattern was repeated throughout his career . The Eagles brought him in to refine and improve their " rock " sound , and all of their biggest selling albums and songs were <unk> @-@ produced . Martin Turner of Wishbone Ash has called him " my all time favourite producer " . While the two did not always get along during recording , usually over Turner 's bass @-@ playing style , Turner does credit Szymczyk with giving the band a more commercial sound on one of their most successful albums , 1974 's There 's the Rub .

 = Kefka Palazzo = 
 Kefka Palazzo ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> , romanized as <unk> Palazzo in the Japanese version ) is a character in the Final Fantasy series of video games . Originally designed by Yoshitaka Amano , he appears in the 6th installment of the series - Final Fantasy VI . First introduced as the court jester and army general under Emperor Gestahl , throughout the game he reveals himself to be a nihilistic psychopath , and , finally , takes on a Lucifer @-@ esque form , after setting in motion events leading to the Apocalypse and pronouncing himself the God of Magic . From that point he acts as the game 's primary antagonist . 
 He is also present in the spin @-@ off fighting games Dissidia Final Fantasy and Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy , wherein he is voiced by Shigeru Chiba ( Dave Wittenberg in English localization ) . As well as these appearances , he shows up in Theatrhythm Final Fantasy , Final Fantasy Artniks , and Final Fantasy All the Bravest as an enemy boss character . 
 Kefka has been rated one of the most memorable and most evil video game villains ever created , with critics and fans noting his intense hatred and maniacal laughter as defining characteristics . He has also been compared to the Joker from the Batman universe . 
 = = Attributes = = 
 = = = Character design = = = 
 Kefka 's appearance was designed by Yoshitaka Amano , who was given complete creative freedom in Final Fantasy VI , with only brief character outlines as guidelines . His approach was to create " real " and " alive " characters , though with consideration for the representation as small computer sprites . Kefka is well known for his clown @-@ like apparel , which has been compared to the Joker from Batman . His dress has been described as " garish " , with " makeup smeared across his face " and " a shrill , girlish laughter " that is thought to " punctuate his madness " . 
 = = = Personality = = = 
 Given only the artwork and outline to work with during production , writer Yoshinori Kitase felt that one early scene of Kefka 's approach of a castle was too " boring to make completely normal " and decided to ad @-@ lib a scene where he requests that his accompanying soldiers dust off his boots in the middle of a desert . The scene set the tone for his personality from that point onwards , suggesting that there " may be a screw or two missing from this character 's head " . He has been described as " powerful " and " manipulative " , though he is retiring on occasion when confronted by opposition and even called a coward for his delegating . He is also known for his sarcastic tone and one @-@ liners . As Kefka 's power grows , his nihilism and madness grow in tandem and , as he attains godlike powers he thirsts for the destruction of all life , expresses his loathing of everything in existence by chanting the word " hate " to his enemies . He is also very sadistic , taking amusement at the very idea of people dying and screaming . This is especially evident when he poisoned Doma , as well as his admission prior to confronting the Returners for the final time that he enjoys destroying things precisely because precious lives are lost in the process . In his Dissidia appearance , Kefka 's insanity is further explored , suggesting that his actions stem from a desire to fill his heart with destruction when love failed to provide his life with meaning . Final Fantasy VI features a song called " Kefka " , which exemplifies the " sadistic joy " of the character . His laughter has been called the greatest video game laughter of all time .

 = = = Final Fantasy VI = = = 
 Kefka first appears as a general under the game 's primary antagonist Emperor Gestahl , serving as his court mage . Prior to the start of the game , he was the first human to be experimentally infused with the magic @-@ like craft " Magitek , " which granted him the ability to wield magic , although the imperfect process warped his mind and made him into the nihilistic psychopath he is during the course of the game . Through the first half of the game , Kefka leads the charge for the city @-@ state of Vector to conquer the world , one kingdom at a time , using their magic weapons . Kefka mentally enslaves Terra and uses her to lead an attack on the town of Narshe to claim the frozen esper <unk> there . When she escapes Imperial control , he pursues Terra to the kingdom of Figaro , setting the castle ablaze as she , Locke and King Edgar flee . 
 During a siege on the kingdom of Doma , Kefka grows impatient with fellow Imperial General Leo and poisons the drinking water in the castle of Doma , resulting in mass casualties and a swift victory for the Empire . After the alliance of Espers and revolutionaries invade and destroy Vector , Gestahl feigns sorrow for the Empire 's evils , and to gain the trust of the protagonists , Gestahl has Kefka imprisoned , citing the poisoning of Doma . Kefka later goes to the village of <unk> to kill the espers congregated there , killing Leo when he tries to intervene . Using the power of the espers , Kefka helps Gestahl raise the espers ' homeworld and create the Floating Continent , where they intend to awaken three entities known as the Warring Triad . Upon being confronted by the protagonists , Gestahl freezes them except for former Imperial general Celes , whom he orders to kill her friends to show her loyalty to the Empire . She instead stabs Kefka , who becomes enraged . Kefka and the Emperor then get in an argument as to what degree they will wield the power of the triad — the Emperor taking a more conservative approach , since he only wants enough power to rule the world , while Kefka wants to unleash the Warring Triad 's full potential . The Emperor tries and fails to kill Kefka , who retaliates by having the Warring Triad strike Gestahl down and unceremoniously boots him off the Floating Continent to his death . Kefka then moves the statues of the Warring Triad out of balance , unleashing enough raw magical energy to reshape the face of the planet and bringing about the second act of the game . 
 Imbued with the power of the statues , Kefka becomes the god of the ruined world he created , using the statues to forge a massive tower of random debris to serve as his headquarters . Kefka smites the millions who refuse to worship him with his " Light of Judgment " , a beam of incinerating light capable of cutting fissures into the planet 's surface . Confronted by the protagonists at the game 's conclusion , Kefka reveals his nihilistic motivations : when the protagonists reject his claims , Kefka goes berserk and proclaims his desire to eradicate everything . Upon the defeat of his minions , Kefka reveals his godlike form and , after uttering one final nihilistic vision of life , dreams and hope , attacks the protagonists before he is ultimately dispatched , causing the power of magic to vanish . 
 = = = Other games = = = 
 Kefka is the villain representing Final Fantasy VI in Dissidia Final Fantasy , where the gods Cosmos and Chaos are fighting a cosmic war for control , with Kefka on the side of Chaos . As revealed in its prequel Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy , Kefka controlled Terra while she was a warrior of Chaos until Kuja weakens his spell , allowing Terra to escape and become a warrior of Cosmos with the aid of Vaan . During the events of Dissidia , Kefka allies himself with the Cloud of Darkness to bring Terra back to their side so he can use her Esper powers to fulfill his destructive desires . However , mastering her powers , Terra defeats Kefka to obtain her crystal . After Cosmos 's death , Kefka breaks his ties to the other villains and starts his own scheme to become the ruler of the ruined world before being ultimately dispatched for good . Kefka received a considerable amount of work and changes according to producer Tetsuya Nomura and planning director Mitsunori Takahashi . Translator Tom Slattery , who worked on Final Fantasy VI Advance for the Game Boy Advance , enjoyed writing new dialogue for Kefka . Director Takahashi Mitsunori said he felt that developing Kefka 's attacks such as " reverse magic " felt similar to development of the recurring minor character Gilgamesh 's attacks , and that the staff enjoyed brainstorming the moves . Kefka 's Japanese voice actor , Shigeru Chiba , ad @-@ libbed many lines , including shouting seafood words like " Pike ! " " <unk> ! " 
 Kefka makes cameo appearances in Itadaki Street Portable , Theatrhythm Final Fantasy , and Final Fantasy : All the Bravest as an antagonist . He also appears as a huntable villain in a GREE social network card game called " Final Fantasy Artniks " , where players must share information to find and defeat Kefka to earn rewards . He also appears in the 2015 arcade reboot of Dissidia : Final Fantasy as an add @-@ on character , where his role is reprised by Chiba . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 Konami video game developer Tomm Hulett described Kefka as a pure villain , stating " Unlike most Japanese stories , Kefka did not have shades of gray . He didn 't have a tragic past that turned him into a sadistic clown that you felt sorry for him over . He didn 't have some greater purpose that he lost sight of . Yet , at the same time , he wasn 't ' evil for evil 's sake . ' There was something twisted and nasty inside him that MADE him that way ... and you could feel it ... but you also knew there wasn 't any good in there . " That he is a central villain of the entire game also serves to intensify a players negative fixation on him . In a review of Final Fantasy VI Advance , IGN stated " it 's the game 's maniacal nihilist Kefka that really stands out . The most evil and destructive villain in the entire Final Fantasy franchise , Kefka 's brutality and ruthlessness is unmatched and he has to be seen to be believed . " IGN also noted his ability to " tap into primal , instinctive fears " , including fears of clowns . CNet in their own review described him as " the unrivaled star of the show ... he 's the kind of villain that you will love to hate " , comparing him to Jack Nicholson 's portrayal of the Joker and calling his laugh one of the greatest sound effects in any video game . Kotaku has called Kefka the greatest video game villain of all time , and attempted to explain players ' lasting fascination by noting that he inspires such hatred that when his evil plans are finally thwarted , the sense of joy from victory is so much the greater . GameSpy compared Kefka 's final form as a representation of Lucifer , highlighted by his powerful " Fallen Angel " attack . Another theory posited by GameSpot is that the intense reaction to Kefka stems from the fact that he is one of the few villains in Final Fantasy , or any game , that succeeds at his master plan before he is defeated .

 In 2006 , Kefka was made into a toy in the Final Fantasy Master Creatures line . The figure is 6 " tall from the bottom of the base , representing his final form from the game 's conclusion . A <unk> doll of Kefka in his human form was also created by <unk> . An album of the music from Final Fantasy VI entitled " Kefka 's Domain " was released on July 1 , 1994 . A figurine was created of Kefka for Square Enix 's " Final Fantasy Creatures Kai Volume 5 " in 2012 .

 In a " Reader 's Choice " edition of GameSpot 's " Top Ten Video Game Villains " , Kefka placed first , stating " Kefka topped many of your lists , as the villain who gave Sephiroth a run for his money in the status department . You love and hate Kefka , but you surely think he 's about as vile and evil as evil gets . " In a similar article the boss battle against Kefka was voted by readers as one of the ten best in video games ; GameSpot 's staff noted " Kefka is one of the two bosses that won through the write @-@ in ballot , meaning he wasn 't on our main list of nominees . That means he 's a serious favorite . " 
 Nintendo Power named Kefka the best villain to appear on Nintendo consoles in 1994 , ranking higher than Donkey Kong Country 's King K. Rool and Marvel Comics ' Carnage . They again featured him in their January 2010 issue , ranking him as their third favorite Nintendo villain . He also was ranked 3rd place in the " Our Favorite Villains , " section of their " 250 Reasons to Love Nintendo , " article . He was described as " An insane , remorseless clown with godlike powers who wants to destroy everyone and everything ( and comes frighteningly close to achieving his goal ) , Kefka is downright evil . " UGO.com named him third in their " Top 25 Japanese RPG Characters " article , stating " Insane , nihilistic , and cruel , Kefka isn 't a reserved mystery like other Final Fantasy villains – rather , he 's in @-@ your @-@ face at all times , doing dirty deeds just to say he did them . " Digital Spy states that he caused some of the most surprising moments in the Final Fantasy series when he destroyed the world . IGN ranked him sixth on their list of the " Top 25 " Final Fantasy characters of all time , noting that several factors , such as his dialogue and appearance , contributed to his memorability as a character ; in a " Reader 's Choice " edition of the article he placed eighth , with similar comments . He was also ranked 18th in IGN 's " Top 100 Videogame Villains " list . GamePro ranked him 33rd on the top 47 most diabolical video game villains of all time , citing both his " genocide " and his enslavement of Terra . GamesRadar ranked him the most " outrageous camp bad guys " , stating that when compared to Kefka , Final Fantasy VII antagonist Sephiroth seems as interesting as a dead accountant painted brown . They also compared him to Batman antagonist the Joker , praising him for both his villainous ambition and his laugh . Gamespy declared that Kefka is quite possibly the greatest video game villain of all time .

 The 14th Boat Race took place on the River Thames on 4 April 1857 . Held annually , The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge . Oxford rowed in a keel @-@ less carvel @-@ built boat , the first time in the history of the race that such a construction method was used for one of the vessels . Umpired by Joseph William Chitty , the race was won by Oxford who triumphed over Cambridge by 11 lengths .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having defeated Oxford by half @-@ a @-@ length in the previous year 's race . They led overall with eight wins to Oxford 's five . 
 It was the first race to feature a keel @-@ less carvel @-@ built boat . Purchased personally by Oxford boat club president Arthur Heywood @-@ Lonsdale from Newcastle boat builder Matthew Taylor , the Oxford crew rowed a practice time of 19 minutes 50 seconds in it , considered " remarkable " in a boat with fixed seats . Lonsdale engaged Taylor to instruct Oxford how to " send his boat along as quickly as possible " , avoiding connotations of professional coaching which was banned in the Boat Race . Cambridge rowed in a boat built by Salter of Wandsworth . It was also the first race in which both crews rowed with round loom oars . 
 Oxford " soon showed signs of good pace " in practice and set the course record with 19 minutes 50 seconds , a time which would remain unbeaten until the 1873 race . Cambridge began their practice rows " very late " . The race was umpired by Joseph William Chitty who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 ( in the March and December races ) and the 1852 race . 
 = = Crews = = 
 Oxford saw four crew members return from the 1856 race in Gurdon , Lonsdale , Thorley and the cox , Elers , while Cambridge welcomed back just two former Blues in Lloyd and Snow . Oxford were marginally the heavier crew at an average of just over 11 st 9 lb ( 73 @.@ 8 kg ) per rower , about 1 pound ( 0 @.@ 5 kg ) more on average than Cambridge . The Oxford president , Heywood @-@ Lonsdale , rowed at number seven while his counterpart , R. Lloyd , rowed at six for the Light Blues . 
 = = Race = = 
 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station , leaving Cambridge with the Surrey station . Starting soon after 11am , Oxford made a good start and at Searle 's boathouse ( originally home to the Leander Club ) were clear of Cambridge . They increased their lead to a length by the time they had reached " The Crab Tree " pub . Despite Cambridge making a number of pushes to try to recover the deficit , Oxford continued to pull away and completed the course 32 seconds ahead of Cambridge , and eleven lengths clear . The winning time was 22 minutes 5 seconds . It was Oxford 's fourth victory in the previous five races and represented the largest winning margin since the 1841 race . It was described in the Oxford Books ' account as " without doubt ... about the most hollow beating ever given to Cambridge by Oxford . "

 New York State Route 132 ( NY 132 ) is a 2 @.@ 75 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 43 km ) state highway located entirely within the town of Yorktown in Westchester County , New York , in the United States . The route acts as a connector between the concurrency of U.S. Route 202 ( US 202 ) and NY 35 in the south and US 6 in the hamlet of Shrub Oak in the north . When the route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , it continued southeast to the hamlet of Katonah . It was cut back to its current southern terminus in the early 1940s and extended one block northward to its present length between 1968 and 1973 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 132 begins at an intersection with the concurrency of US 202 and NY 35 in front of Franklin D. Roosevelt State Park in the town of Yorktown . NY 132 proceeds north along Old Yorktown Road , crossing through a residential section of Yorktown . After passing a junction with <unk> Drive , the route takes a turn to the northwest then returns to its northerly progression near Strang Boulevard . Remaining a two @-@ lane residential street through Yorktown , NY 132 passes Lakeland Copper Beech Middle School and turns northwest once again towards more homes and into a partial diamond interchange with the Taconic State Parkway . At this interchange , there is no access from NY 132 to the northbound Taconic , and no access from the southbound Taconic to NY 132 . 
 A short distance northwest of the interchange , NY 132 reaches a junction with the eastern end of East Main Street ( unsigned County Route 1309 ( CR 1309 ) ) . Two blocks north of East Main Street , NY 132 enters a junction with US 6 in the hamlet of Shrub Oak . This junction marks the northern terminus of NY 132 , whose right @-@ of @-@ way continues north through Yorktown as Barger Street , connecting to the Putnam County line . 
 = = History = = 
 The north – south highway connecting Crompond Road to the hamlet of Shrub Oak was acquired by the state of New York in the mid @-@ 1920s . It did not have a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became part of NY 132 , a new route extending from US 6 in Shrub Oak to NY 22 near the hamlet of Katonah . The highway went southeast from Shrub Oak to Yorktown Heights on Crompond Street and Crompond Road , from where it traveled generally eastward to Katonah on <unk> Mill , Saw Mill River , Amawalk , and Woods Bridge roads . In Katonah , NY 132 used Woods Bridge Road , Bedford Road , and Jay Street to connect to NY 22 . 
 As originally assigned , NY 132 bypassed the center of Yorktown Heights to the north . This was changed by 1932 as NY 132 was realigned to directly serve the hamlet by way of Crompond and Saw Mill River roads . In the early 1940s , all of NY 132 east of Yorktown became part of NY 35 , a new cross @-@ county route extending from Peekskill to the Connecticut state line . As a result , NY 132 was truncated to its junction with NY 35 and US 202 in the hamlet of Yorktown . NY 132 's northern terminus was moved a short distance northward between 1968 and 1973 as a result of the re @-@ alignment of US 6 through Yorktown . Prior to being called Old Yorktown Road , most of NY 132 was named Crompond Street . 
 = = NY 132A = = 
 NY 132A was a suffixed route of NY 132 in the town of Yorktown . When it was initially assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 132A was an alternate route of NY 132 along Mohansic Avenue and Baldwin Road , providing access from NY 132 to Mohansic State Park . Part of Mohansic Avenue was demolished in the early 1930s to make way for the Taconic State Parkway , splitting the route into two pieces . The western segment was removed from the state highway system while the eastern stub remained designated as NY 132A . NY 132 was truncated to Yorktown in the early 1940s , separating it from NY 132A ; however , NY 132A was not renumbered or otherwise altered . The route remained in existence until the mid @-@ 1970s , at which time maintenance of Mohansic Avenue and Baldwin Road was transferred to the town of Yorktown .

 = Southern Rhodesia in World War II = 
 Southern Rhodesia , then a self @-@ governing colony of the United Kingdom , entered World War II along with Britain shortly after the invasion of Poland in 1939 . By the war 's end in 1945 , 26 @,@ 121 Southern Rhodesians of all races had served in the armed forces , 8 @,@ 390 of them overseas , operating in the European theatre , the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre , East Africa , Burma and elsewhere . The territory 's most important contribution to the war is commonly held to be its contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme ( EATS ) , under which 8 @,@ 235 British , Commonwealth and Allied airmen were trained in Southern Rhodesian flight schools . The colony 's operational casualties numbered 916 killed and 483 wounded of all races . 
 Southern Rhodesia had no diplomatic powers , but largely oversaw its own contributions of manpower and materiel to the war effort , being responsible for its own defence . Rhodesian officers and soldiers were distributed in small groups throughout the British and South African forces in an attempt to prevent high losses . Most of the colony 's men served in Britain , East Africa and the Mediterranean , particularly at first ; a more broad dispersal occurred from late 1942 . Rhodesian servicemen in operational areas were mostly from the country 's white minority , with the Rhodesian African Rifles — made up of black troops and white officers — providing the main exception in Burma from late 1944 . Other non @-@ white soldiers and white servicewomen served in East Africa and on the home front within Southern Rhodesia . Tens of thousands of black men were conscripted from rural communities for work , first on the aerodromes and later on white @-@ owned farms . 
 World War II prompted major changes in Southern Rhodesia 's financial and military policy , and accelerated the process of industrialisation . The territory 's participation in EATS brought about major economic and infrastructural developments and led to the post @-@ war immigration of many former airmen , contributing to the growth of the white population to over double its pre @-@ war size by 1951 . The war remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades afterwards . Since the country 's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980 , the modern government has removed many references to the World Wars , such as memorial monuments and plaques , from public view , regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism . Southern Rhodesia 's dead of the war today have no official commemoration , either in Zimbabwe or overseas . 
 = = Background = = 
 When World War II broke out in 1939 , the southern African territory of Southern Rhodesia had been a self @-@ governing colony of the United Kingdom for 16 years , having gained responsible government in 1923 . It was unique in the British Empire and Commonwealth in that it held extensive autonomous powers ( including defence , but not foreign affairs ) while lacking dominion status . In practice , it acted as a quasi @-@ dominion , and was treated as such in many ways by the rest of the Commonwealth . Southern Rhodesia 's white population in 1939 was 67 @,@ 000 , a minority of about 5 % ; the black population was a little over a million , and there were about 10 @,@ 000 residents of coloured ( mixed ) or Indian ethnicity . The franchise was non @-@ racial and in theory open to all , contingent on meeting financial and educational qualifications , but in practice very few black citizens were on the electoral roll . The colony 's Prime Minister was Godfrey Huggins , a physician and war veteran who had emigrated to Rhodesia from England in 1911 and held office since 1933 . 
 The territory 's contribution to the British cause during World War I ( 1914 – 18 ) had been very large in proportion to its white population , though troops had been mostly raised from scratch as there had been no professional standing army beforehand . Since the start of self @-@ government in 1923 , the colony had organised the all @-@ white Rhodesia Regiment into a permanent defence force , complemented locally by the partly paramilitary British South Africa Police ( BSAP ) . The Rhodesia Regiment comprised about 3 @,@ 000 men , including reserves , in 1938 . The country had fielded black troops during World War I , but since then had retained them only within the BSAP . A nucleus of airmen existed in the form of the Southern Rhodesian Air Force ( SRAF ) , which in August 1939 comprised one squadron of 10 pilots and eight Hawker Hardy aircraft , based at Belvedere Airport near the capital Salisbury . 
 The occupation of Czechoslovakia by Adolf Hitler 's Nazi Germany in March 1939 convinced Huggins that war was imminent . Seeking to renew his government 's mandate to pass emergency measures , he called an early election in which his United Party won an increased majority . Huggins rearranged his Cabinet on a war footing , making the Minister of Justice Robert Tredgold Minister of Defence as well . The territory proposed forces not only for internal security but also for the defence of British interests overseas . Self @-@ contained Rhodesian formations were planned , including a mechanised reconnaissance unit , but Tredgold opposed this . Remembering the catastrophic casualties suffered by units such as the Newfoundland Regiment and the South African Brigade on the Western Front in World War I , he argued that one or two heavy defeats for a white Southern Rhodesian brigade might cause crippling losses and have irrevocable effects on the country as a whole . He proposed to instead concentrate on training white Rhodesians for leadership roles and specialist units , and to disperse the colony 's men across the forces in small groups . These ideas met with approval in both Salisbury and London and were adopted . 
 Southern Rhodesia would be automatically included in any British declaration of war due to its lack of diplomatic powers , but that did not stop the colonial government from attempting to demonstrate its loyalty and legislative independence through supportive parliamentary motions and gestures . The Southern Rhodesian parliament unanimously moved to support Britain in the event of war during a special sitting on 28 August 1939 . 
 = = Outbreak of war = = 
 When Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 , following the invasion of Poland , Southern Rhodesia issued its own declaration of war almost immediately , before any of the dominions did . Huggins backed full military mobilisation and " a war to the finish " , telling parliament that the conflict was one of national survival for Southern Rhodesia as well as for Britain — the mother country 's defeat would leave little hope for the colony in the post @-@ war world , he said . This stand was almost unanimously supported by the white populace , as well as most of the coloured community , though with World War I a recent memory this was more out of a sense of patriotic duty than enthusiasm for war in itself . The majority of the black population paid little attention to the outbreak of war . 
 The British had expected Italy ( with its African possessions ) to join the war on Germany 's side as soon as it began , but fortunately for the Allies this did not immediately occur . No. 1 Squadron SRAF was already in northern Kenya , having been posted to the Italian East African frontier at Britain 's request in late August . The first Southern Rhodesian ground forces to be deployed abroad during World War II were 50 Territorial troops under Captain T G Standing , who were posted to Nyasaland in September at the request of the colonial authorities there to guard against a possible uprising by local German expatriates . They returned home after a month having seen little action . White Rhodesian officers and non @-@ commissioned officers left the colony in September and October 1939 to command units of black Africans in the west and east of the continent , with most joining the Royal West African Frontier Force ( <unk> ) in Nigeria , the Gold Coast and neighbouring colonies . The deployment of white Rhodesian officers and NCOs to command black troops from elsewhere in Africa met with favour from the military leadership and became very prevalent . 
 As in the First World War , white Rhodesians volunteered for the forces readily and in large numbers . Over 2 @,@ 700 had come forward before the war was three weeks old . Somewhat ironically , the Southern Rhodesian recruiters ' main problem was not sourcing manpower but rather persuading men in strategically important occupations such as mining to stay home . Manpower controls were introduced to keep certain men in their civilian jobs . The SRAF accepted 500 recruits in the days following the outbreak of war , prompting its commander Group Captain C W Meredith to contact the Air Ministry in London with an offer to run a flying school and train three squadrons . This was accepted . In January 1940 the Southern Rhodesian government announced the establishment of an independent Air Ministry to oversee the Rhodesian Air Training Group , Southern Rhodesia 's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme ( EATS ) . 
 Huggins set up a Defence Committee within the Cabinet to co @-@ ordinate the colony 's war effort in early 1940 . This body comprised the Prime Minister , the Finance Minister Jacob Smit , Tredgold and Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Ernest Lucas Guest , the Minister of Mines and Public Works , who was put in charge of the new Air Ministry . About 1 @,@ 600 of the colony 's whites were serving overseas by May 1940 when , during the Battle of France , Salisbury passed legislation allowing the authorities to call up any male British subject of European ancestry aged between 19 and a half and 25 who had lived in the colony for at least six months . The minimum age was reduced to 18 in 1942 . Part @-@ time training was compulsory for all white males between 18 and 55 , with a small number of exceptions for those in reserved occupations . On 25 May 1940 Southern Rhodesia , the last country to join the EATS , became the first to start operating an air school under it , beating Canada by a week . The SRAF was absorbed into the British Royal Air Force ( RAF ) in April 1940 , with No. 1 Squadron becoming No. 237 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron RAF . The RAF subsequently designated two more Rhodesian squadrons , namely No. 266 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron ( in 1940 ) and No. 44 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron ( 1941 ) , in a manner similar to the Article XV squadrons from Australia , Canada and New Zealand .

 = = = Early deployments = = = 
 No. 237 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron , based in Kenya since before the start of the war , had expanded to 28 officers and 209 other ranks by March 1940 . By mid @-@ 1940 , most of the officers and men Southern Rhodesia had sent overseas were in Kenya , attached to various East African formations , the King 's African Rifles ( KAR ) , the <unk> , or to the colony 's own Medical Corps or Survey Unit . The Southern Rhodesian surveyors charted the previously unmapped area bordering Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland between March and June 1940 , and the Medical Corps operated No. 2 General Hospital in Nairobi from July . A company of coloured and Indian @-@ descended Rhodesian transport drivers was also in the country , having arrived in January . 
 The first Southern Rhodesian contingent despatched to North Africa and the Middle East was a draft of 700 from the Rhodesia Regiment who left in April 1940 . No white Rhodesian force of this size had ever left the territory before . They were posted to a variety of British units across Egypt and Palestine . The largest concentration of Rhodesian soldiers in North Africa belonged to the King 's Royal Rifle Corps ( KRRC ) , whose connections with the colony dated back to World War I. Several Rhodesian platoons were formed in the KRRC 's 1st Battalion in the Western Desert . A company of men from the Southern Rhodesian Signal Corps was also present , operating in tandem with the British Royal Corps of Signals . 
 = = = East Africa = = = 
 Italy joined the war on Germany 's side on 10 June 1940 , opening the East African Campaign and the Desert War in North Africa . A Rhodesian @-@ led force of irregulars from the Somaliland Camel Corps — based in British Somaliland , on the Horn of Africa 's north coast — took part in one of the first clashes between British and Italian forces when it exchanged fire with an Italian banda ( irregular company ) around dawn on 11 June . Two days later three Caproni bombers of the Regia Aeronautica attacked Wajir , one of No. 237 Squadron 's forward airstrips , damaging two Rhodesian aircraft . 
 Italian forces entered British Somaliland from Abyssinia on 4 August 1940 , overcame the garrison at Hargeisa , and advanced north @-@ east towards the capital Berbera . The British force , including a platoon of 43 Rhodesians in the 2nd Battalion of the Black Watch , took up positions on six hills overlooking the only road towards Berbera and engaged the Italians at the Battle of Tug <unk> . Amid heavy fighting , the Italians gradually made gains and by 14 August had almost pocketed the Commonwealth forces . The British retreated to Berbera between 15 and 17 August , the Rhodesians making up the left flank of the rearguard , and by 18 August had evacuated by sea . The Italians took the city and completed their conquest of British Somaliland a day later . 
 No. 237 Squadron embarked on reconnaissance flights and supported ground assaults on Italian desert outposts during July and August 1940 . Two British brigades from West Africa arrived to reinforce Kenya 's northern frontier in early July — the partly Rhodesian @-@ officered Nigeria Regiment joined the front at Malindi and <unk> , while a battalion of the Gold Coast Regiment , also with Rhodesian commanders attached , relieved the KAR at Wajir . The British forces in East Africa adopted the doctrine of " mobile defence " that was already being used in the Western Desert in North Africa — units embarked on long , constant patrols to guard wells and deny water supplies to the Italians . The British evacuated their north forward position at Buna in September 1940 , and expected an attack on Wajir soon after , but the Italians never attempted an assault . Boosted considerably by the arrival of three South African brigades during the last months of 1940 , the Commonwealth forces in Kenya had expanded to three divisions by the end of the year . No. 237 Squadron was relieved by South African airmen and redeployed to the Sudan in September . 
 <unk> at Khartoum , No. 237 Squadron undertook regular reconnaissance , dive @-@ bombing and strafing sorties during October and November 1940 . Meanwhile , the Southern Rhodesian Anti @-@ Tank Battery arrived in Kenya in October and , following a period of training , received 2 @-@ pounder guns and joined the front at <unk> around the turn of the new year . No. 237 Squadron was partially re @-@ equipped during January 1941 , receiving some Westland Lysander Mk IIs , but most of the squadron continued operating Hardys . 
 The British forces in Kenya under General Alan Cunningham , including Rhodesian officers and NCOs in the King 's African Rifles and the Nigeria and Gold Coast Regiments , as well as the South African 1st Infantry Division , advanced into Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland during late January and February 1941 , starting with the occupation of the ports of Kismayo and Mogadishu . The Italians retreated to the interior . No. 237 Squadron meanwhile provided air support to the 4th and 5th Indian Divisions during Lieutenant @-@ General William Platt 's offensive into Eritrea from the Sudan , attacking ground targets and engaging Italian fighters . One of the Rhodesian Hardys was shot down near Keren on 7 February with the loss of both airman aboard ; two days later five Italian fighters attacked a group of grounded Rhodesian aircraft at Agordat in western Eritrea , and wrecked two Hardys and two Lysanders . 
 Platt 's advance into Eritrea was checked during the seven @-@ week Battle of Keren ( February – April 1941 ) , during which No. 237 Squadron observed Italian positions and took part in bombing raids . After the Italians retreated and surrendered , the Rhodesian squadron moved forward to Asmara on 6 April , whence it embarked on bombing sorties on the port of Massawa . The same day , the Italian garrison in the Abyssinian capital Addis Ababa surrendered to the 11th ( East Africa ) Division , including many Rhodesians . The forces of Platt and Cunningham converged and surrounded the remainder of the Italian forces , commanded by the Italian viceroy the Duke of Aosta , at the mountain stronghold of Amba Alagi . The viceroy surrendered on 18 May 1941 , effectively ending the war in East Africa . No. 237 Squadron and the Rhodesian Anti @-@ Tank Battery thereupon moved up to Egypt to join the war in the Western Desert . Some Italian garrisons continued to fight — the last surrendered only following the Battle of Gondar in November 1941 . Until this time the partly Rhodesian @-@ commanded Nigeria and Gold Coast Regiments remained in Abyssinia , patrolling and rounding up scattered Italian units . Around 250 officers and 1 @,@ 000 other ranks from Southern Rhodesia remained in Kenya until mid @-@ 1943 . 
 = = = North Africa = = = 
 In North Africa , Rhodesians in the 11th Hussars , 2nd Leicesters , 1st Cheshires and other regiments contributed to Operation Compass between December 1940 and February 1941 as part of the Western Desert Force under Major @-@ General Richard O 'Connor , fighting at Sidi Barrani , Bardia , Beda <unk> and elsewhere . This offensive was extremely successful , with the Allies suffering very few casualties — around 700 killed and 2 @,@ 300 wounded and missing — while capturing the strategic port Tobruk , over 100 @,@ 000 Italian soldiers and most of Cyrenaica . The Germans reacted by despatching the Afrika Korps under Erwin Rommel to shore up the Italian forces . Rommel led a strong counter @-@ offensive in March – April 1941 that forced a general Allied withdrawal towards Egypt . German and Italian forces surrounded Tobruk but failed to take the largely Australian @-@ garrisoned city , leading to the lengthy Siege of Tobruk . 
 The Rhodesian contingents in the 11th Hussars , Leicesters , Buffs , Argylls , Royal Northumberland Fusiliers , Durham Light Infantry and Sherwood Foresters were transferred en masse to Kenya in February 1941 to join the new Southern Rhodesian Reconnaissance Regiment , which served in East Africa over the following year . The Rhodesians in the 1st Cheshires moved with that regiment to Malta the same month . The Rhodesian Signallers were withdrawn to Cairo to form a section handling high @-@ speed communications between Middle East Command and General Headquarters in England . The 2nd Black Watch , with its Rhodesian contingent , took part in the unsuccessful Allied defence of Crete in May – June 1941 , then joined the garrison at Tobruk in August 1941 . No. 237 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron was re @-@ equipped with Hawker Hurricanes the following month . 
 Rhodesians made up an integral component of the Long Range Desert Group ( LRDG ) , a mechanised reconnaissance and raiding unit formed in North Africa in 1940 to operate behind enemy lines . Initially made up of New Zealanders , the unit 's first British and Rhodesian members joined in November 1940 . It was reorganised several times over the next year as it expanded and by the end of 1941 there were two Rhodesian patrols : S1 and S2 Patrols , B Squadron . Each vehicle bore a Rhodesian place @-@ name starting with " S " on the bonnet , such as " <unk> " or " sabi " . From April 1941 the LRDG was based at Kufra in south @-@ eastern Libya . The Rhodesians were posted to Bir <unk> , about 160 kilometres ( 99 mi ) to the north @-@ east of Kufra , to patrol , hold the <unk> Gap and guard against a possible Axis attack from the north . For the next four months they lived in near @-@ total isolation from the outside world , an exception coming in July 1941 when they and a group of airmen from No. 237 Squadron celebrated Rhodes Day together in the middle of the <unk> desert . 
 In November 1941 the British Eighth Army , commanded by General Cunningham , launched Operation Crusader in an attempt to relieve Tobruk . The British XXX Corps , led by the 7th Armoured Division ( " the Desert Rats " ) with its Rhodesian platoons , would form the main body of attack , advancing west from Mersa Matruh , then sweeping around in a north @-@ westerly direction towards Tobruk . The XIII Corps would concurrently advance north @-@ west and cut off Axis forces on the coast at Sollum and Bardia . When signalled the Tobruk garrison would break out and move south @-@ east towards the advancing Allied forces . The operation was largely successful for the Allies , and the siege was broken . The Rhodesians of the LRDG took part in raids on Axis rear areas during the operation , ambushing Axis convoys , destroying Axis aircraft and pulling down telegraph poles and wires . 
 From late 1941 the LRDG co @-@ operated closely with the newly formed Special Air Service ( SAS ) , which also included some Rhodesians . The Rhodesian LRDG patrols transported and supported SAS troops during operations behind Axis lines . The LRDG also maintained a constant " Road Watch " along the Via <unk> on the north coast of Libya , along which almost all Axis road traffic from Tripoli , the main Libyan port , had to travel east . The LRDG set up a watch post about 8 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) east of the Italian Marble Arch monument , and teams of two men each recorded Axis vehicle and troop movements in shifts throughout the day and night . This information was relayed back to the British commanders in Cairo . 
 Rommel advanced east from January 1942 , and won a major victory over the Eighth Army , commanded by Lieutenant @-@ General Neil Ritchie , at the Battle of Gazala in May – June 1942 . The Axis soon thereafter captured Tobruk . During the Axis victory at the " <unk> Box " — part of the British @-@ devised system whereby isolated , strongly fortified " boxes " , each manned by a brigade group , formed the front line — and the subsequent Allied retreat , the Southern Rhodesian Anti @-@ Tank Battery lost five men killed , nine wounded and two missing ; 37 were captured . Rommel 's advance was stalled in July by the Eighth Army , now headed by General Claude Auchinleck , at the First Battle of El Alamein in western Egypt . Two months later the Rhodesians of the LRDG took part in Operation <unk> ( aka Operation Snowdrop ) , an unsuccessful attempt by the SAS and LRDG to raid Benghazi harbour . The SAS raiding force , headed by Lieutenant @-@ Colonel David Stirling , was discovered by an Italian reconnaissance unit , prompting Stirling to turn back to Kufra . The Rhodesians , meanwhile , were led into impassable country by a local guide , and swiftly retreated after being attacked by German bombers . 
 Southern Rhodesian pilots played a part in the siege of Malta during 1942 . John Plagis , a Rhodesian airman of Greek ancestry , joined the multinational group of Allied airmen defending the strategically important island in late March and on 1 April achieved four aerial victories in an afternoon , thereby becoming the siege 's first Spitfire flying ace . By the time of his withdrawal in July he had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross twice . The British finally delivered vital supplies to Malta on 15 August with Operation Pedestal . 
 Back in Salisbury , the Southern Rhodesian government was coming under pressure from Britain to put its armed forces under the purview of a regional command . Huggins decided in late October 1942 to join a unified Southern African Command headed by South Africa 's Jan Smuts . This choice was motivated by a combination of strategic concerns and geopolitical manoeuvring . Apart from considering South Africa a more appropriate partner in geographical , logistical and cultural terms , Huggins feared that the alternative — joining the British East Africa Command — might detract from the autonomous nature of Southern Rhodesia 's war effort , with possible constitutional implications . A shift in the deployment of the colony 's troops duly occurred . For the rest of the war the majority of Rhodesian servicemen went into the field integrated into South African formations , prominently the 6th Armoured Division . 
 = = = El Alamein = = = 
 The decisive victory of Lieutenant @-@ General Bernard Montgomery 's Eighth Army over the Germans and Italians at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October – November 1942 turned the tide of the North African war strongly in favour of the Allies , and did much to revive Allied morale . The Rhodesians of the KRRC took part in the battle as part of the 7th Armoured Division under the XIII Corps , forming part of the initial thrust in the southern sector . 
 The Rhodesian Anti @-@ Tank Battery under Major Guy Savory also fought at El Alamein , supporting the Australian 9th Division as part of the XXX Corps . The fighting around " Thompson 's Post " between 1 and 3 November was some of the fiercest Rhodesians took part in during the war . Hoping to knock out the Allied anti @-@ tank guns before counter @-@ attacking , the Germans concentrated intense artillery fire on the Australian and Rhodesian guns before advancing 12 Panzer IV tanks towards the weakest point of the Australian line . The Australian six @-@ pounders had been largely disabled by the bombardment but most of the Rhodesian guns remained operational . The Rhodesian gunners disabled two Panzers and seriously damaged two more , compelling an Axis retreat , and held their position until being relieved on 3 November . One Rhodesian officer and seven other ranks were killed and more than double that number were wounded . For his actions at Thompson 's Post , Sergeant J A <unk> received the Distinguished Conduct Medal ; Lieutenants R J <unk> and H R C <unk> won the Military Cross and Trooper P Vorster the Military Medal . 
 The KRRC Rhodesians were in the forefront of the Allied column pursuing the retreating Axis forces after El Alamein , advancing through Tobruk , Gazala and Benghazi before reaching El Agheila on 24 November 1942 . They patrolled around the Axis right flank until being withdrawn to <unk> in December . Tripoli fell to the Eighth Army on 23 January 1943 , and six days later Allied forces reached Tunisia 's south @-@ eastern frontier , where Italian and German forces manned the Mareth Line , a series of fortifications built by the French in the 1930s . 
 = = = Tunisia = = = 
 The Mareth Line constituted one of two fronts in the Tunisia Campaign , the second being to the north @-@ west , where the British First Army and American II Corps , firmly established in formerly Vichy @-@ held Morocco and Algeria following Operation Torch in November 1942 , were gradually pushing the Axis forces under Hans @-@ Jürgen von Arnim back towards Tunis . After von Arnim won a decisive victory over the Americans at the Battle of Sidi Bou Zid in mid @-@ February 1943 , destroying over 100 US tanks , the Eighteenth Army Group was formed under the British General Harold Alexander to co @-@ ordinate the actions of the Allied forces on both Tunisian fronts . 
 The Eighth Army under Montgomery spent February at Medinine in south @-@ eastern Tunisia . Expecting an imminent attack by the Axis , the Eighth Army mustered every anti @-@ tank gun it could from Egypt and Libya . The 102nd ( Northumberland Hussars ) Anti @-@ Tank Regiment , including the Rhodesian Anti @-@ Tank Battery under Major Savory , duly advanced west from Benghazi and reached the front on 5 March 1943 . The Germans and Italians assaulted Medinine the next day , but failed to make much progress and abandoned their attack by the evening . The Rhodesian gunners , held in reserve , did not take part in the engagement but were attacked from the air . The Rhodesians of the KRRC , now under the 7th Motor Brigade , moved up from Libya during early March . No. 237 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron , which had spent 1942 and the first months of 1943 in Iran and Iraq , returned to North Africa the same month , with the future Prime Minister Ian Smith in its ranks as a Hurricane pilot . 
 Montgomery launched his major assault on the Mareth Line , Operation <unk> , on 16 March . The Rhodesian Anti @-@ Tank Battery , operating with the 50th ( Northumbrian ) Infantry Division , took part . The Allies advanced at first but the weather and terrain prevented the tanks and guns from moving forward , allowing the 15th Panzer Division to counter @-@ attack successfully . A flanking movement by the 2nd New Zealand Division around the right of the German forces , through the Tebaga Gap , compelled an Axis withdrawal on 27 March . The Rhodesian anti @-@ tank gunners fought their last action in Africa at Enfidaville , 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) south of Tunis , on 20 April . The KRRC Rhodesians meanwhile took part in a long outflanking march which brought them to El <unk> , 65 kilometres ( 40 mi ) south @-@ west of Tunis , the next day . British armour entered Tunis on 7 May 1943 . The Axis forces in North Africa — over 220 @,@ 000 Germans and Italians , including 26 generals — surrendered a week later . 
 By time Tunis had fallen , few Rhodesians remained with the First or Eighth Armies ; most were transferring to the South African 6th Armoured Division , then in Egypt , or making their way home on leave . Out of the 300 Southern Rhodesians who had joined the KRRC in Egypt , only three officers and 109 other ranks remained at the end of the Tunisian Campaign . The Rhodesian Anti @-@ Tank Battery retraced many of the movements it had taken during the campaign as it returned to Egypt . " Left for Matruh at 0830 hours today , " one Rhodesian gunner wrote . " <unk> at night on the identical spot where we camped in June 1941 . It gave me a queer feeling to look back and think how many of us are missing . " 
 = = = Dodecanese = = = 
 Southern Rhodesia was represented in the Dodecanese Campaign of September – November 1943 by the Long Range Desert Group , which was withdrawn from the North African front in March 1943 . After retraining for mountain operations in Lebanon , the LRDG moved in late September to the Dodecanese island of Kalymnos , north @-@ west of Kos and south @-@ east of Leros , off the coast of south @-@ west Turkey . In the fall @-@ out from the armistice between Italy and the Allies , which had been concluded in the first week of September , the Allies were attempting to capture the Dodecanese so the islands could be used as bases against the German @-@ occupied Balkans . Most of the Italian forces had changed sides ; the LRDG found itself in an infantry role , acting as a mobile reserve for Italian troops . 
 The Germans swiftly mobilised to expel the Allied forces and launched heavy air assaults on Kos and Leros . Without fighter support , the islands ' defence was soon precarious ; the LRDG and the rest of the troops on Kalymnos were withdrawn to Leros on 4 October after the Germans won the Battle of Kos . German air assaults on Leros intensified during late October , and at dawn on 12 November 1943 the Germans attacked Leros by sea and air . During the ensuing Battle of Leros , the LRDG Rhodesians at Point 320 , commanded by Rhodesian Captain J R Olivey , spiked their position 's guns and withdrew before counter @-@ attacking and retaking the point the next day . They held that position for three more days , during which they learned that the Germans were winning the battle . On 16 November , Olivey decided that holding the point any longer was pointless and ordered his men to split up , escape by any means possible and re @-@ assemble in Cairo . Over half of the unit reached Egypt . 
 = = = Italy = = = 
 The largest concentration of Southern Rhodesian troops in the Italian Campaign of 1943 – 45 was the group of about 1 @,@ 400 , mainly from the Southern Rhodesian Reconnaissance Regiment , spread across the South African 6th Armoured Division . The 11th South African Armoured Brigade , one of the 6th Division 's two main components , was made up of Prince Alfred 's Guard , the Pretoria Regiment ( Princess Alice 's Own ) and the Special Service Battalion , each of which had a Rhodesian squadron of Sherman tanks . The other , the 12th South African Motorised Brigade , comprised infantry — the Witwatersrand Rifles , the Natal <unk> and the Cape Town Highlanders , the last of which had a large Rhodesian contingent . There were also two Rhodesian artillery batteries — the original Rhodesian Anti @-@ Tank Battery and a newer unit of Rhodesian field gunners . After a year 's training in Egypt , the division sailed to Italy in April 1944 , landing towards the end of the month at Taranto . No. 237 Squadron , now flying Spitfires , rebased to Corsica the same month to operate over Italy and southern France . 
 The 6th Division moved north @-@ west from Taranto to take its place as part of the Eighth Army alongside the US Fifth Army . It took part in the fourth and final Allied assault of the Battle of Monte Cassino in the second and third weeks of May 1944 , helping to force the Germans out , and thereafter advanced north @-@ west up the Liri valley to join the Allied forces at Anzio and advance onwards to Rome . After wiping out a small German force about 50 km ( 31 mi ) east of the Italian capital on 3 June , the 6th Division advanced north and captured the town of <unk> , then doubled back to the south @-@ west and moved on Rome , which was reached on the morning of 6 June . A Squadron , Pretoria Regiment — that unit 's squadron of Rhodesian tanks — entered the city as part of the division 's vanguard . 
 The German commander Albert Kesselring fought a stubborn delaying action , gradually withdrawing his armies north with three Allied columns in pursuit , the 6th Armoured Division leading the most westerly spearhead of the Eighth Army in the centre . The mountainous terrain and the effective use of anti @-@ tank weapons by the retreating Germans made the Allies ' superiority in armour less decisive and slowed the Allied advance north to the banks of the Arno between June and August 1944 , during which time the Rhodesian tank squadrons took part in Allied victories at Castellana , <unk> and <unk> . 
 By the end of August 1944 the German forces in Italy had formed the Gothic Line along the Apennine Mountains , and the 6th Division had come under the command of the US Fifth Army . The difficulty of using tanks in the mountains led to the Rhodesians of Prince Alfred 's Guard temporarily adopting an infantry role , using dismounted tank machine @-@ guns to support the Natal Carabineers during the fighting for Pistoia during early September . The Southern Rhodesian Anti @-@ Tank Battery meanwhile converted partially from guns to 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch mortars . The South Africans and Rhodesians met with fierce resistance from the 16th SS Panzer Grenadier Division , but helped push the Germans northwards towards the Reno river . 
 Hoping to repel Allied advances towards Bologna , the Germans took up positions on Monte <unk> overlooking the main roads towards the city . Two Allied assaults on the mountain — one by an Indian battalion , the other by the Royal Natal Carabineers — were repulsed . A third , larger attack at dawn on 13 October provided the Rhodesian Company of the Cape Town Highlanders with some of the fiercest combat they encountered in Italy . Advancing up the slope on the Allied right flank while being fired on from two directions , they suffered heavy casualties but achieved their objective and held it . Both Rhodesian artillery batteries provided support during the assault . 
 When the line stabilised in November 1944 , the portion occupied by the 6th Armoured Division extended for 16 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) along the heights over the Reno River . The Rhodesians of the Cape Town Highlanders patrolled nightly around the village of <unk> for the next three months . Some of the tank crews , including the Rhodesians of the Special Service Battalion , were temporarily reassigned to infantry duties to assist in these patrols . Many of the Rhodesians had never seen snow before , but on the whole they adapted well , taking up winter sports such as skiing during time off duty . The Rhodesians of the Special Service Battalion received new , more heavily armed tanks in November – December 1944 . In February 1945 the 6th Division was relieved by the American 1st Armoured Division and moved to Lucca , 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) north of Pisa , for rest and reorganisation . The Rhodesian Anti @-@ Tank Battery was refitted with M10 tank destroyers . The Spitfires of No. 237 Squadron , meanwhile , took part in assaults on German transport in the Po Valley around Parma and Modena . 
 = = = Balkans and Greece = = = 
 After the Battle of Leros , New Zealand withdrew its squadron from the Long Range Desert Group , compelling the LRDG to reorganise itself into two squadrons of eight patrols each . A Squadron was composed of Rhodesians and B Squadron comprised British troops and a squadron of signallers ; around 80 of the officers and men were from Southern Rhodesia . The group was reassigned from the Middle East Command to the Central Mediterranean Force in early 1944 , and deployed to the Gargano peninsula in south @-@ eastern Italy , where a new LRDG headquarters was set up near the seaside town of Rodi . Britain hoped to compel the Germans to commit as many divisions as possible to south @-@ eastern Europe so they could not be used on the more important fronts closer to Germany . In June 1944 the LRDG was assigned to operate on the western coast of Yugoslavia , with orders to set up observation posts , report the movements of German ships and undertake minor raids . 
 The successes of Josip Broz Tito 's Yugoslav partisans in Dalmatia led the Allies to despatch small patrols into Yugoslavia and Albania to contact partisan leaders and arrange co @-@ operation with the Allied air forces . Several Rhodesian patrols from the LRDG were selected to undertake such missions during August and September 1944 . Yugoslav partisans subsequently indicated targets for Allied bombing missions , with some success . From September , members of the LRDG 's Rhodesian squadron under Captain Olivey undertook advanced reconnaissance in the Peloponnese peninsula of southern Greece . Landing at Katakolo , they made their way inland to Corinth and , along with the British 4th Parachute Battalion , entered Athens as the Germans departed in November . The Rhodesians of the LRDG spent November and December helping Greek forces to garrison an Athens orphanage against supporters of the communist Greek People 's Liberation Army . Four Rhodesians were killed . 
 The LRDG returned to Yugoslavia in February 1945 , operating around Istria and Dalmatia , where Germany still held portions of the mainland and certain strategic islands . The Germans had heavily mined the southern Adriatic and were attempting to cover their shipping by moving only by night , close to shore , and heaving to during the day under camouflage nets . The LRDG was tasked to patrol the coast , find the ships and report their locations to the air force for bombing . This it did with success . It remained in Yugoslavia for the rest of the war . 
 The heightened vigilance of the German garrison as the war entered its final phase made these operations especially hazardous , particularly as they were often attempted at extremely close quarters . On several occasions Rhodesian patrols only narrowly escaped discovery . During one action , two Rhodesian patrols catered for the possibility that Germans might be listening to their transmissions by communicating in Shona , an African language . The LRDG 's last actions of the war , in April and May 1945 , were to help Tito 's partisans capture German @-@ held islands off Dalmatia . 
 = = = Spring 1945 offensive in Italy = = = 
 Kesselring 's forces in Italy retained their formidable defensive positions in the northern Apennines in March 1945 . The 6th Division rejoined the line in early April , shortly before the Allies launched their spring 1945 offensive , Operation Grapeshot . The units including Rhodesians took up positions opposite Monte Sole , Monte <unk> and Monte <unk> . The Rhodesian 25 @-@ pounder guns were posted slightly forward of their former positions , and B ( Rhodesia ) Squadron , Prince Alfred 's Guard , moved to <unk> . The Special Service Battalion provided armoured support to the 13th South African Motorised Brigade . 
 The South Africans and Rhodesians launched a two @-@ pronged assault on the German positions over the road to Bologna at 22 : 30 on 15 April 1945 . The Cape Town Highlanders ' advance up the steep cliffs of Monte Sole was obstructed by a German minefield that guarded the peak . The Rhodesian officer commanding the leading platoon , Second Lieutenant G B Mollett , took a section of men and dashed through the minefield to the summit ; for this he later received the Distinguished Service Order . Hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting on Monte Sole continued until dawn , when the Germans withdrew . The Witwatersrand Rifles meanwhile took Monte <unk> . The Cape Town Highlanders took Monte <unk> late on 16 April , advancing under heavy artillery fire to the summit before clearing it of Germans . The regiment lost 31 killed and 76 wounded during these actions , including three Rhodesians killed and three wounded . 
 This victory contributed to a general Allied breakthrough in the area , and by 19 April , the 6th Division 's armour was moving towards Lombardy and Venetia as part of the Fifth Army 's vanguard . American and Polish troops entered Bologna on 21 April . The South Africans and Rhodesians advanced north @-@ west towards the <unk> river . The Special Service Battalion 's Rhodesian squadron , moving forward alongside the Cape Town Highlanders , and the Rhodesians of Prince Alfred 's Guard took part in numerous engagements with the retreating German rearguard , and suffered several fatalities . 
 The 6th Division crossed the Po near <unk> on 25 April and , after resupplying for a week , began a speedy advance towards Venice , aiming to cut off the retreat of elements of the German Fourteenth Army . The South Africans and Rhodesians advanced through <unk> and <unk> , crossed the Adige early on 29 April , and then made for Treviso , 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) north of Venice . The retreating German forces were by this time in such disarray that , during its advance from the Po , the 11th South African Armoured Brigade took prisoners from eight German divisions . On 30 April , the 6th Division joined up with British and American forces south of Treviso , and cut off the Germans ' last escape route from Italy . 
 The German forces in Italy surrendered unconditionally on 2 May 1945 , while the 6th Division was moving north @-@ west ; at the time of the announcement it was near Milan . Twelve days later the 6th Division held a victory parade of its 1 @,@ 200 guns , tanks and other vehicles at Monza racetrack , 16 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) north of Milan . The Rhodesians separated from their vehicles after the parade , then spent May and June 1945 as occupation troops in Lombardy before returning home . 
 = = Britain , Norway and western Europe = = 
 Southern Rhodesia 's fighting contributions in Britain and western Europe were primarily in the air , as part of the much larger Allied forces . Rhodesian pilots and Allied airmen trained in the colony 's flying schools participated in the defence of Britain throughout the war , as well as in the strategic bombing of Germany and other operations . Rhodesia provided the only RAF flying ace of the Norwegian Campaign of April – June 1940 , Squadron Leader Caesar Hull . Later that year " The Few " , the Allied airmen of the Battle of Britain , included three pilots of Southern Rhodesian birth — Hull , Pilot Officer John <unk> and Flight Lieutenant John Holderness — of whom two , Hull and <unk> , lost their lives . 
 Two of the RAF 's three Rhodesian squadrons , Nos. 44 and 266 , operated from England during the war . No. 266 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron , a fighter squadron based in Cambridgeshire for most of the duration , was initially only nominally Rhodesian , being manned by a mixture of British and Commonwealth personnel , but it received more airmen from the colony gradually and was virtually all Rhodesian by August 1941 . Initially flying Spitfires , it switched to Typhoons in early 1942 . It took as its motto the Sindebele word <unk> ( " Stabber of Skies " ) and first went into action over Dunkirk on 2 June 1940 , after which it fought in the Battle of Britain . The squadron 's duties thereafter included patrolling , protecting convoys , sweeping around northern France and the Belgian and Dutch coasts , and escorting bombing raids over France and the Rhine . 
 No. 44 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron , based in Lincolnshire on the east coast , was a heavy bomber unit , and part of No. 5 Group in RAF Bomber Command 's front line . Unlike the other two squadrons designated as " Rhodesian " , No. 44 Squadron never had a Rhodesian majority , despite efforts to so populate it . Initially equipped with Hampdens , it became the first RAF squadron to convert to Lancasters at the end of 1941 . It played a prominent part in the attack on the MAN diesel factory at Augsburg in April 1942 . In March 1943 No. 44 Squadron took part in the Allied bombing of cities in northern Italy , including Genoa and Milan , as well as targets in Germany such as Wilhelmshaven , Cologne and Berlin . 
 From early 1944 , No. 266 Squadron took part in ground attack operations over the Channel and northern France , operating from RAF <unk> in Devon . The squadron also escorted Allied bombers embarking on or returning from raids , protecting them from German fighters . Larger petrol tanks were fitted to the Typhoons to increase their range . In May 1944 the squadron was visited by the Prime Minister , who had been knighted and was now Sir Godfrey Huggins . Over the next month , in preparation for the imminent Allied invasion of Normandy , the Rhodesian aircraft took on a fighter @-@ bomber role , flying sorties across the channel twice a day and participating in the bombing of bridges , roads , railways and the like . 
 Apart from the Southern Rhodesian airmen serving with the RAF in Britain , the colony was sparsely represented in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944 ( " D @-@ Day " ) . Several men from the colony served aboard cruisers and destroyers that engaged the German shore batteries . A small number of Southern Rhodesians parachuted into Normandy with the 6th Airborne Division during Operation Tonga , and some took part in the amphibious landings . No. 266 Squadron was part of the Allied force that flew over the beaches during the first landings , supporting the infantry . Later that day it took part in sorties to assist the paratroopers holding the bridgeheads north of Caen . 
 No. 266 Squadron , which remained 95 % Rhodesian at the start of 1945 , thereafter provided air support to the advancing Allied armies through France , the Low Countries and finally Germany . Through most of the European winter months it was based in Antwerp . In late March 1945 the Rhodesian fighters formed part of the force tasked with protecting the descending Allied paratroopers during Field @-@ Marshal Montgomery 's crossing of the Rhine . During April the squadron operated over Hanover and the northern Netherlands . No. 44 Squadron , meanwhile , embarked on bombing raids on targets as far away as Gdynia and Königsberg in East Prussia , as well as towns and cities closer to Berlin such as Dresden , Emden and Leipzig . Its last bombing operation was a raid on the Berghof , Hitler 's residence , near Berchtesgaden in Bavaria on 25 April 1945 . After Germany surrendered on 7 May , ending the war in Europe , No. 44 Squadron was one of many units selected to evacuate British prisoners of war home from the continent . 
 = = Burma = = 
 Southern Rhodesia 's main contribution to the Burma Campaign in terms of manpower was made by the Rhodesian African Rifles ( RAR ) , a regiment of black troops led by white officers that joined the front at the end of 1944 . The colony also made a significant contribution to the Commonwealth forces ' command element in Burma , providing white officers and NCOs to the 81st ( West Africa ) , 82nd ( West Africa ) and 11th ( East Africa ) Divisions , made up of units from Nigeria , the Gold Coast , the Gambia , Sierra Leone , Kenya , Uganda , Tanganyika , Nyasaland , Northern Rhodesia and the Congo . Almost every African battalion in Burma had white Rhodesian officers and NCOs attached ; some were over 70 % Rhodesian @-@ led . 
 Modelled on the Rhodesia Native Regiment of World War I , the RAR was formed in May 1940 under the command of Lieutenant @-@ Colonel F J Wane , who the black soldiers nicknamed <unk> @-@ we @-@ <unk> ( " top of the mountain " ) . Most volunteers for the regiment came from Mashonaland , much to the surprise of the white recruiters , who had expected Matabeleland , with stronger martial traditions , to provide more men . Originally comprising one battalion , the RAR expanded to two battalions in late 1943 to accommodate a rush of new recruits following the news that the 1st Battalion was being deployed overseas . Steps to organise two further battalions of black Southern Rhodesians were abandoned because of the conviction of the colony 's overall military commander , Brigadier E R Day , that it was important " to preserve a fair balance " between black and white troops , and that raising the men would take too long in any case . 
 1RAR trained in Kenya from December 1943 to September 1944 , when it transferred to Ceylon and became part of the 22nd ( East Africa ) Infantry Brigade alongside the 1st KAR and the 3rd Northern Rhodesia Regiment . In December 1944 , after three months ' training for jungle warfare , 1RAR and the other two components of the brigade joined the Burma Campaign at Chittagong under the command of the 15th Indian Corps . The brigade spent about three months supporting the 25th Indian Division in north @-@ western Burma , advancing through the Mayu peninsula during January 1945 and taking part in the latter stages of the Battle of Ramree Island , landing on the island on 14 February . 1RAR fortified positions at <unk> , <unk> and <unk> but did not contact Japanese forces . 
 A widespread belief developed among Japanese troops in Burma that the British Army 's African soldiers were cannibals , partly because of deliberate disinformation spread by the black troops themselves as they travelled around the country . While entirely unfounded , the notion " that we Africans eat people " , as one RAR soldier put it , had a fearsome psychological effect ; men of 1RAR reported Japanese soldiers picking up their comrades ' bodies in the midst of battle and running away . 
 In March 1945 the 22nd Brigade was ordered south to <unk> where it became part of the 82nd ( West Africa ) Division , which had been tasked with clearing the Taungup area of Japanese troops . The 22nd Brigade was deployed as a flank guard , sweeping down the Tanlwe Chaung before hooking around to the Taungup Chaung and ultimately the road to <unk> ; this move was intended to cut Japanese units to the north off from the Irrawaddy Delta to the south , where most of the key battles were being fought . 1RAR patrolled the area during March and April 1945 and was involved in several contacts . On 20 April it assembled at a point overlooking Tanlwe Chaung , where it was shelled by Japanese artillery and mortars dug in atop two high features to the south . On the morning of 26 April , after a few days of patrols , 1RAR took the lead in what became the Battle of Tanlwe Chaung ; after about half an hour of bombing , strafing and artillery bombardment of the Japanese positions , elements of A and D Companies , 1RAR charged up the slopes and routed much of the Japanese garrison before taking both hills . Seven RAR men were killed in the action and 22 were wounded , mostly from D Company ; an officer was also injured . An officer of the RAR recalled the battles of April 1945 around Taungup and Tanlwe Chaung as extremely intense : 
 1RAR spent most of May 1945 building quarters and training before marching the 110 km ( 68 mi ) to <unk> in late June ; from here they went another 25 km ( 16 mi ) by truck to <unk> . The monsoon conditions took a dreadful toll on operations , making logistics particularly difficult and slow — men found themselves either found themselves knee @-@ deep in mud or slipping around on the surface . From early July 1945 1RAR patrolled around <unk> , repeatedly engaging parties of Japanese and forcing them into the hills . Even after the Japanese commanders in Burma surrendered unconditionally , the Allied troops had to continue patrolling to handle Japanese stragglers who either did know of this or did not believe it . After the Japanese forces in South @-@ East Asia formally surrendered at Singapore on 12 September 1945 , active Allied operations in the region were greatly diminished . 1RAR spent about half a year guarding Japanese prisoners in Burma before leaving for home in March 1946 . They arrived back in Salisbury on 10 May . 
 = = Southern Rhodesians in other theatres = = 
 In addition to the main deployments , Southern Rhodesian servicemen served in other theatres of the war . Rhodesian sailors in the Royal , South African and Merchant Navies crewed ships in many parts of the world , including the Indian Ocean , the Arctic and the Pacific . No. 237 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron operated in Iran and Iraq in 1942 – 43 , guarding oil wells and pipelines and supporting the British Tenth Army . 
 Closer to home , Southern Rhodesian military surveyors contributed to the preliminary planning work for the Allied invasion of Madagascar in May 1942 , and landed at Diego Suarez with the invading forces . They remained there long after the Vichy French garrison agreed to an armistice at <unk> on 6 November 1942 — the last Rhodesian left the island in October 1943 .

 = = = Rhodesian Air Training Group = = = 
 The colony 's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme is described in J F MacDonald 's War History of Southern Rhodesia as " undoubtedly Southern Rhodesia 's greatest single contribution to the Allied victory " , an assertion corroborated by Robert Blake in his 1977 History of Rhodesia . The Rhodesian Air Training Group ( RATG ) under Air Vice @-@ Marshal Sir C W Meredith eventually operated 11 aerodromes , requiring a huge national effort to build , maintain and staff — at the scheme 's peak more than a fifth of the white population was involved . This judicious management of skills and resources allowed the territory to make a much larger contribution to the Allied war effort than if it had simply sent all its manpower into the field . 
 Southern Rhodesia was regarded as an ideal location for air training for a number of reasons . It was far from the hostilities , firmly pro @-@ British and had excellent weather throughout the year . The British Air Ministry resolved to outsource training to the colony amid some urgency in late 1939 after EATS took a long time to get going in Canada . The RATG was the last EATS group to be formed , but the first to start training airmen ; it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of the others , doing so for the first time in November 1940 . 
 The programme originally called only for an initial training wing and six schools , but this was expanded to eight flying schools and a school for bomb aimers , navigators and air gunners . There were two air firing and bombing ranges . Six reserve landing grounds were constructed for landing and take @-@ off instruction to prevent congestion on the main airstrips . Later in the war , a dedicated air station was designated for the training of instructors . Small administrative units were established in South Africa at Cape Town , Durban and Port Elizabeth to handle incoming equipment and arrivals and departures of personnel . 
 The complete pilot 's course initially lasted six months , split into two months each of elementary , intermediate and advanced instruction . Ground subjects were also taught and each trainee had to fly at least 150 hours to qualify . By the end of the war each period had been shortened by a week to speed up the output of trained pilots . 
 The trainees were mostly British , but came from all over the world . " The diversity of nationalities under training was surprising and impressive , " reported one officer . " British , South African , New Zealand , Australian , Canadian , American , men from Yugoslavia , Greece , Free France , Poland , Czechoslovakia , Kenya , Uganda , Tanganyika , Fiji Isles , Malta . " " [ Southern Rhodesia 's ] part in the Commonwealth Air Training Scheme has been outstandingly fine , " Sir James Ross of the British Air Ministry reported in 1942 . " I say this from knowledge and without qualification . ... I know how gratefully the Air Staff in London reckon on the unfailingly regular flow of well @-@ trained pilots and observers , course after course , month after month . " 
 = = = Home service = = = 
 The Rhodesian African Rifles were based at Borrowdale in north @-@ east Salisbury between 1940 and 1943 . Apart from a contingent sent south to Durban to guard Italian prisoners on their way to Rhodesia , the regiment 's main role was garrison duties within the colony . The Rhodesian Air Askari Corps , a unit of black volunteer troops under white command , guarded the air bases and also provided manpower for non @-@ armed labour . The perceived possibly that Japan might attempt an invasion of southern Africa via Madagascar led to the consolidation of a few hundred rural whites into the Southern Rhodesia Commando , a part @-@ time cadre intended as the basis for a guerrilla @-@ style resistance movement , from 1942 . 
 The mobilisation of white British South Africa Police officers for military service led to black male and white female constables taking on higher responsibilities . The BSAP recruited more black patrolmen to accommodate the growth of the urban black population during the war , going from 1 @,@ 067 black and 547 white personnel in 1937 to 1 @,@ 572 blacks and 401 whites in 1945 . This " Africanisation " led to higher appreciation for black constables among senior policemen and the public . The police remained rigidly segregated , but black constables received uniforms more similar to those of their white counterparts , and the nominal distinction between the BSAP " proper " and the British South Africa Native Police — the " force within the force " black personnel were traditionally regarded as members of — was abolished . 
 = = = = Women = = = = 
 White Southern Rhodesian women served in the war with auxiliary female units , in far greater numbers than in World War I. The Southern Rhodesian government set up three women 's services : the Women 's <unk> Volunteers ( WAV ) , the Women 's Auxiliary Air Service ( <unk> ) , the Women 's Auxiliary Military Service ( <unk> ) and the Women 's Auxiliary Police Service ( <unk> ) . Most Southern Rhodesian servicewomen served domestically within these organisations , while some went to East Africa with the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry . 
 The WAV , run by the Ministry of Defence , recruited and trained female personnel for the <unk> and the <unk> , which respectively came under the Air and Defence Ministries . According to the official statement announcing their formation , the services ' purpose was " to substitute women for men wherever necessary and practicable throughout the military and air forces within Southern Rhodesia . " 
 Recruitment for the women 's services began in June 1941 . Most volunteers were married women , many of them the wives of military men . The air and military services both offered a wide variety of positions . In addition to jobs as typists , clerks , caterers and the like , women served as drivers and in the stores and workshops . Many of the women in the air service did skilled work , checking flying instruments , testing parts and doing minor repairs . The women of the Auxiliary Police Service served as BSAP officers both in stations and on the streets . 
 Members of Southern Rhodesia 's white female population who did not join the forces still contributed to the war in various ways . Women worked in munitions factories and engineering workshops in Salisbury and Bulawayo . The Women 's National Service League , which thousands of women joined before the war even started , revived the role white Rhodesian women had played in World War I , sending the colony 's servicemen overseas parcels containing warm clothes , newspapers , razor blades , soap , food and minor luxuries such as sweets , tobacco and novels . Efforts such as these did much to keep the troops ' morale up .

 On the outbreak of war , Huggins invited the leader of the opposition Labour Party , Harry Davies , to join a coalition government . Davies accepted without consulting his party caucus , much to the indignation of many of his contemporaries ; Labour promptly split . The two Labour factions reconciled in 1943 and briefly threatened Huggins 's premiership until a heated dispute over whether Labour should become multiracial led to the party 's disintegration in 1944 . 
 = = = Economic impact ; conscripted labour ( chibaro ) = = = 
 The Southern Rhodesian economy grew considerably during the war despite the concurrent rise of war expenditure to pay for the expansion of the military and the air training scheme . Expenditure on the war grew from £ 1 @,@ 793 @,@ 367 in the financial year 1940 – 41 to £ 5 @,@ 334 @,@ 701 in 1943 – 44 — total Southern Rhodesian expenditure on the air training scheme was £ 11 @,@ 215 @,@ 522 . These sums , while tiny compared to those incurred by larger nations , were enormous when scaled against the white population of less than 70 @,@ 000 that accounted for most of the colony 's economic output . Annual costs for the air training scheme alone far exceeded the pre @-@ war national budget . 
 Southern Rhodesia was then the second largest gold producer in the world , after South Africa . The colony 's gold output had expanded greatly during the 1930s , and it remained the territory 's main source of income during the war , though many extracting operations were diverted towards strategic minerals , most prominently chrome and asbestos . Southern Rhodesia became one of the two main sources of chrome for the Allies ( South Africa was the other ) and the world 's third largest producer of asbestos after Canada and the Soviet Union . By the end of the war the mines at Shabani and <unk> were turning out 1 @.@ 5 million tonnes of asbestos a year , in addition to 600 @,@ 000 tonnes of chrome . Gold output reached peak levels in 1941 – 42 and thereafter subsided . Southern Rhodesia also exported tungsten , mica and tin , and provided coal for the copper mines of Northern Rhodesia and the Congo . The Southern Rhodesian government encouraged private enterprise to form secondary industries to exploit the colony 's natural resources and increase production , but also set up some state industries in an attempt to spark growth . The establishment of the RATG prompted a minor economic boom , and also caused the primary direct demand placed on Southern Rhodesia 's black population during the early stages of the war — a programme of conscripted labour to build the aerodromes . 
 The government assigned labour quotas for each district to native commissioners across the territory who in turn called on local chiefs and headmen to provide workers . The tribal leaders decided who was required at the kraal and who would report to the district native commissioner for work . This system , known locally as the chibaro , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> — according to Charles van <unk> , synonymous etymologically with concepts ranging from contract labour to slavery — had been relatively widespread during Company rule ( 1890 – 1923 ) , but had fallen out of use by the 1930s . Some tribal communities were resettled to make room for the airstrips . 
 The chibaro workers received pay and provisions , but the salary of 15s / - per month compared unfavourably with the 17s / 6d generally received on white @-@ owned farms . It met with widespread opposition , with many men electing to run away rather than join the work parties . " Hundreds if not thousands " , according to Kenneth Vickery , crossed into Bechuanaland or South Africa to avoid the call @-@ up . Some suspected that after finishing the conscripted aerodrome work , they might be drafted to fight overseas . Rumours to this effect abounded enough that the chief native commissioner , H H D Simmonds , distributed a circular in November 1940 instructing the commissioners to make clear that the drafted men were required for labour only . 
 Voluntary employment increased sharply during 1940 and 1941 , both among indigenous blacks and migrant labourers , but many white farmers still complained about a lack of manpower . A severe drought during the 1941 – 42 season led to a food shortage in the colony , prompting the passing in June 1942 of the Compulsory Native Labour Act , under which unemployed black males between 18 and 45 years of age could be conscripted for work on white @-@ owned farms . Announcing the act , Tredgold — by now Minister of Native Affairs in addition to Defence and Justice — commented that its " principle ... would be intolerable under ordinary circumstances " , but that the war made it necessary . The act required each draftee to work at least three months at 15s / - per month ; the pay rose to 17s / 6 if he agreed to stay a further three months . This conscription of labour contributed to the rise in the country 's overall agricultural yield , but had a negative impact on the localised production of many kraals , either because too many men had been drafted for work elsewhere or because they had fled to avoid it . The scheme continued until the act 's repeal in 1946 . 
 A central Food Production Committee , set up in early 1942 , organised the conscripted labourers and attempted to help the white farmers to grow all the crops they could . Maize production grew by 40 % between 1942 and 1944 , the potato harvest doubled and the onion crop grew sixfold by the end of the war . Production of the colony 's most important cash crop , tobacco , was high throughout the war , averaging about 40 million pounds ( 18 million kg ) annually . The number of cattle slaughtered by the beef industry increased by 134 % , from 71 @,@ 000 head in 1937 to 160 @,@ 000 head in 1945 . Vegetable dehydration , one of the Food Production Committee 's main initiatives , proved a great success , allowing Rhodesia to export many products to the UK that would previously have spoiled in transit . Southern Rhodesia also provided goods to the Eastern Group Supply Council , a body set up in 1940 to co @-@ ordinate the build @-@ up of war materiel in India and other British colonies and dominions east of Suez , with the goal of reducing the amount of supplies shipped from the UK . A Rhodesian officer , Brigadier E G Cook , was the group 's deputy controller general . Between 1941 and 1945 Southern Rhodesia contributed large quantities of timber , leather goods , soap and building materials . 
 = = = Internment camps and Polish refugees = = = 
 Thousands of Axis POWs and people described as " enemy aliens " were held in Southern Rhodesia during the conflict . These were mainly Italians and Germans , but there were also a handful from Iraq and the Levant ; the colony furthermore hosted nearly 7 @,@ 000 refugees from Poland . Britain delegated responsibility for co @-@ ordinating investigation into enemy aliens in central Africa to the Southern Rhodesian government , which set up a system whereby the Criminal Investigation Department ( CID ) identified potential detainees while a body called the Internment Camps Corps oversaw the camps . Many of those held in Southern Rhodesia were sent there by Britain or authorities elsewhere in the Empire . 
 Five internment camps were set up in two waves . No. 1 ( General ) Internment Camp opened to the north @-@ east of Salisbury in October 1939 and No. 2 ( Tanganyika ) Internment Camp , just south of the city , opened the following year , mostly housing Germans formerly resident in Tanganyika . The first two camps together had less than 800 inmates . The third , fourth and fifth camps were set up near Gatooma , <unk> and Fort Victoria in 1941 – 42 to accommodate roughly 5 @,@ 000 Italians from Somaliland and Abyssinia . The Internment Camps Corps ' reliance on the elderly , the infirm and so @-@ called " friendly aliens " to staff the three new camps led to indiscipline , poor living conditions and dozens of escapes . A 1943 government commission into the quality of the internment camps reported the second wave camps to be of far worse quality than those of the first wave . 
 Polish refugees were housed at dedicated settlements set up at Marandellas and <unk> , two towns about 40 km ( 25 mi ) apart to the south @-@ east of Salisbury , from 1943 . There were similar camps in Kenya , Nyasaland , Tanganyika , Northern Rhodesia and South Africa . The Polish settlements in Southern Rhodesia were run jointly by local authorities and the Polish consulate in Salisbury ; the Polish government @-@ in @-@ exile in London provided funding . Transport back to Europe picked up sharply as the war came to a close , and by October 1945 less than 2 @,@ 000 Polish refugees remained . Colonial officials were reluctant to let the Poles stay indefinitely , asserting that they were not culturally British enough and might have communist connections or sympathies , but most of those who remained showed little inclination to leave . Southern Rhodesia ultimately allowed around 726 Polish refugees to settle permanently after the war .

 Along with most of the Commonwealth and Allied nations , Southern Rhodesia sent a delegation of soldiers , airmen and seamen to London to take part in the grand Victory Parade of 8 June 1946 . The colony 's contingent , led by Colonel R E B Long , marched after South Africa and before Newfoundland . The Southern Rhodesian colour guard comprised a white officer and two black sergeants of the Rhodesian African Rifles . During the royal visit to Southern Rhodesia in April 1947 , King George VI accorded the prefix " Royal " to the Rhodesia Regiment in recognition of its contributions to the two World Wars , and agreed to be its Colonel @-@ in @-@ Chief . 
 Southern Rhodesia had contributed more manpower to the Allied cause in World War II , proportional to white population , than any other British dominion or colony , and more than the UK itself . According to figures compiled by MacDonald for his War History of Southern Rhodesia , 26 @,@ 121 Southern Rhodesians served in the armed forces during the conflict , of whom 2 @,@ 758 were commissioned officers . Broken down by race and gender , there were 15 @,@ 153 black men , 9 @,@ 187 white men , 1 @,@ 510 white women and 271 coloured and Indian men . Of the 8 @,@ 390 who served outside the territory , 1 @,@ 505 were black men , 6 @,@ 520 were white men , 137 were white women and 228 were coloured or Indian men . 
 According to official figures , 33 @,@ 145 black Southern Rhodesians were conscripted for labour between 1943 and 1945 ; Vickery estimates that between 15 @,@ 000 and 60 @,@ 000 more may have worked on the aerodromes . According to Ashley Jackson 's work The British Empire and the Second World War , the Rhodesian Air Training Group instructed 8 @,@ 235 Allied pilots , navigators , gunners , ground crew and others — about 5 % of overall EATS output . 
 A total of 2 @,@ 409 Southern Rhodesians ( 977 officers and 1 @,@ 432 other ranks ) served in the RAF during the war , 373 ( 86 officers and 287 ratings ) joined the Royal Navy , and 13 officers and 36 ratings from Southern Rhodesia mustered into the South African Navy . The vast majority of the rest served in either the Southern Rhodesian territorial forces or the British or South African Army . The colony 's men and women received 698 decorations during the war ; whites received 689 while black troops won nine . No coloured or Indian serviceman was decorated . Army officers won 269 decorations while the other ranks received 158 ; the air force officers and other ranks respectively won 184 and 72 decorations . All eight decorated Southern Rhodesian naval personnel were officers . Of the seven decorated women , all but one held commissioned rank . Two hundred and fifty @-@ three Southern Rhodesians were mentioned in despatches during the war . 
 MacDonald records 916 Southern Rhodesian fatalities from enemy action during World War II — 498 airmen , 407 ground troops , eight seamen and three female personnel — and 483 wounded , of whom 434 were soldiers , 47 were airmen and two were sailors .

 The Rhodesian Air Training Group , widely accepted as the colony 's main contribution to World War II , proved to be " one of the most important happenings in Rhodesian history " , in the words of its commander Air Vice @-@ Marshal Sir C W Meredith , as it led to great economic development and a large wave of immigration after the war by former instructors , trainees and other staff . This contributed to the swelling of Southern Rhodesia 's white population to 135 @,@ 596 , over double its pre @-@ war size , by 1951 . RAF training operations in the country were stepped down considerably after the war , and the project formally ended in March 1954 . 
 The strengthening of ties with South Africa continued following the war as both countries underwent considerable industrialisation . Between 1948 and 1953 Southern Rhodesia and South Africa operated a customs agreement under which most export and import duties were waived . The decade immediately following 1945 has been called " the moment when Southern Rhodesia 's economy ' took off ' " . Huggins , secure in office at the end of the war , remained Prime Minister for another decade afterwards , and oversaw the colony 's Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953 . He retired in 1956 . Southern Rhodesia contributed to several Commonwealth counter @-@ insurgency operations during the 1950s and early 1960s , including the Malayan Emergency , similar actions in Aden and Cyprus , and Operation Vantage in Kuwait . 
 Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change , the Federation failed to become a Commonwealth realm and collapsed in 1963 . Two years later , following prolonged dispute with Britain over the terms for full sovereignty , the mostly white government in Southern Rhodesia ( or Rhodesia , following Northern Rhodesia 's independence as Zambia ) issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence ( UDI ) . The Rhodesian government , counting several World War II veterans including the Prime Minister Ian Smith , attempted to emphasise Rhodesians ' prior war record on Britain 's behalf by declaring independence on Armistice Day , 11 November , at 11 : 00 local time . As part of its subsequent isolation of Rhodesia , the UK government banned the post @-@ UDI authorities from taking part in the annual Armistice Day service at the Cenotaph in London . Smith 's government organised its own Rhodesian wreath @-@ laying ceremony there . Veterans of World War II and Malaya held many key positions in the Rhodesian Security Forces during the Bush War of the 1970s . 
 Since the country 's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980 , Robert Mugabe 's administration has pulled down many monuments and plaques making reference to the dead of the First and Second World Wars , perceiving them as reminders of white minority rule and colonialism that go against what the modern state stands for . This view is partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company 's dead of the Matabele Wars , as well as those memorialising Rhodesian servicemen killed during the Bush War . Many Zimbabweans see their nation 's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that had more to do with the white community than the black majority . Southern Rhodesia 's dead of the two World Wars today have no official commemoration , either in Zimbabwe or overseas . 
 = Digital : A Love Story = 
 Digital : A Love Story is an indie visual novel by video game designer Christine Love , released for free in February 2010 . The game 's story is linear , with the player 's actions unable to significantly change the course of the plot . Set " five minutes into the future of 1988 " , Digital tells the story of the protagonist 's online relationship with a girl and their attempts to solve a mystery surrounding the deaths of several artificial intelligences . The game is presented entirely through the interface of a 1980s computer with online bulletin board system posts and messages from other characters ; the protagonist 's own messages are implied but never shown . The game was received positively , with critics especially praising the game 's writing and plot , and it was noted in lists of the best indie games of 2010 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Digital : A Love Story is a visual novel , or interactive fiction game , where the game 's story is told primarily through text . The game is presented as if on a computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system ( the name and visual appearance a reference to <unk> versions of AmigaOS ) . The player logs into bulletin board systems , or <unk> , where they read and reply to messages from other people . Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen . Accessing a BBS requires the knowledge of the telephone number for that board , which the player must type in manually . Boards that require a long @-@ distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long @-@ distance calling card numbers found online . Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system . 
 Many of the messages sent by the player and the replies back to those messages have no effect on the game . The messages that the player sends are never explicitly revealed , though their contents can be inferred from replies received from other characters in the game . The player , therefore , is unable to send a " wrong " reply or message , and the game cannot be lost . The player does not have a choice in the direction that the story takes , though the game requires the player to correctly decipher what actions to take before the plot can advance . A single playthrough of the game takes around one hour . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game , set " five minutes into the future of 1988 " , opens with the silent protagonist , whose name is given by the player , having just obtained a computer . When the player checks their messages , they learn the telephone number to the Lake City Local BBS , a local board , and can then log on to there . One of the topics posted to that board is some poetry by a girl named " * Emilia " ; when the player responds to her message , the two start up a conversation . While this conversation is ongoing , the player learns of another BBS and of a board whose telephone number is in another area code . They also learn of an illegal method to get access to boards like that , which would otherwise require the purchase of long distance calling cards . The conversation between the player and * Emilia , which is inferred to have taken place over a much longer duration of time than has transpired in reality , begins at this point to show * Emilia forming an attachment to the player . Soon after , * Emilia confesses to the player that she loves them ; however , the host computer for Lake City Local breaks down , leaving the player unable to contact her . 
 Soon afterwards the owner of Lake City Local contacts the player with a garbled message that * Emilia had tried to send to them . This message implies that * Emilia is in danger , asking the player to contact someone named * Paris , and provides a mass of binary code . The player has no context for this message ; but after hacking into another BBS , The Gibson , the player finds a cryptic message reposted from another board saying that there are several artificial intelligences ( AIs ) around the world that have been recently " killed " , naming * Emilia as one of them . The player hacks into the source board for this message , and finds a history of artificial intelligence posted there by * Blue Sky , a " historian " AI . 
 According to * Blue Sky 's records , the American government created an AI at the same time it created ARPANET in the 1970s . This AI , * Mother , in turn created child AIs , but its first attempt spread out of control and had to be destroyed by a virus that spread after it — later officially explained by the government as the real @-@ life Creeper and Reaper worms . * Mother 's later attempts , which could only exist on one system at a time , were more successful , and these AIs left the ARPANET in favor of the Internet when it was developed . * Reaper , however , continued to spread and destroyed any AI it found , such as * Emilia . The player finds * Paris , another AI and * Emilia 's brother , on an ARPANET node , who explains that compiling the binary code in * Emilia 's message can recreate her . The player compiles * Emilia onto their system , and the two learn of a " payload " that the other AIs have developed , which can cause * Reaper to self @-@ terminate ; however , infecting * Reaper with it requires that an AI be recompiled with it as living bait , meaning permanent deletion . Realizing that they have no other choice , * Emilia becomes the payload carrier . After a final conversation , the player allows * Emilia to sacrifice herself , saving the AIs and ending the game .

 Digital was created and released by Christine Love in February 2010 . Although it was not her first game , it was her first successful one ; Love noted in January 2011 that her previous titles were played by " less than a dozen " people , while Digital had been played by " countless thousands " , gotten onto the reading lists of university classes , and became " a defining point in [ her ] writing career " . It was also her largest game to date ; prior to its release she thought of herself only as a writer , not as a game developer . She made Digital as a visual novel rather than just prose because she felt that immersing the player into the game would allow the story to resonate with them more than just reading the text . Love chose to set the game in the 1980s rather than more recently because she felt that the computing systems and number of people online then created a sense of isolation , which she felt was more conducive to both the romance and mystery aspects of the story . One of Love 's influences on the gameplay was Uplink ; she initially intended to reference more of its gameplay mechanics but eventually " streamlined " much of the hacking elements of Digital away . 
 Although * Emilia is explicitly female , Love purposely ensured that the protagonist 's gender is never stated , as she wanted them to be a blank slate that the player would project themselves into , rather than a character that the player would control . She intended this , combined with never showing what the protagonist actually says , to create more immersion in the story . Unofficially , however , Love thought of the relationship as " queer " , both in respect to the player 's gender and in respect to * Emilia as " a confused adolescent falling in love with someone she 's not supposed to " ; Love has stated that this did not come across as strongly as she intended . Love has said that one of the intended messages of the game was the importance of love and relationships , though not necessarily romantic love ; as an example she specifically referenced * Emilia valuing saving her " family " due to her love for them over her adolescent love for the player .

 The writing and story of the game were especially praised by reviewers . Kieron Gillen of Rock , Paper , Shotgun said that after playing it , he " can 't think of a better love story in the Western medium " , and that the terse and minimalist prose worked well to create clearly defined characters . A reviewer from The Economist called the story " engaging " , saying that it provided a " memorable and thought @-@ provoking experience " . In an analysis of the game 's story , Emily Short of Gamasutra called the decision to leave the protagonist blank rather than making a viewpoint character " brilliant " , saying that it made the entire game work much better than it otherwise would . A reviewer from The A.V. Club , grading the game as an " A " , called the story " moving " . The majority of the criticism for the game was in regards to the interface used to navigate the online world ; while The Economist found it quirky and realistic , Gillen felt that it made it easy for the player to miss a key message , leaving the player stuck with no direction as to where to turn . 
 Gamasutra gave Digital an honorable mention in their " Best Indie Games of 2010 " list . It was chosen as a " freeware game pick " by Tim W. of IndieGames , Gamasutra 's independent games site , who said that it was " an absorbing experience that no other game from this day and age can offer . " IndieGames also named it number two in their " Top Freeware Adventure Games of 2010 " . PC Gamer listed it as number seven in their " 20 Free PC Games " feature in May 2011 , saying that it was " an hour of gorgeously crafted , personality @-@ imbued indie gaming . " 
 Love later made a " spiritual sequel " , don 't take it personally , babe , it just ain 't your story , and then another game " that further extends the non @-@ linear style of Digital " , Analogue : A Hate Story .

 " Theef " is the fourteenth episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on March 12 , 2000 . It was written by Vince Gilligan , John Shiban , and Frank Spotnitz and directed by Kim Manners . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Theef " earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 4 , being watched by 11 @.@ 91 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Mulder and Scully investigate the murder of a prominent doctor 's father @-@ in @-@ law , who was found with the word " theef " written on the wall in blood . After a string of follow @-@ up accidents , Mulder suspects <unk> may be the source of threats against the doctor 's family . 
 " Theef " was written in a short amount of time during the show 's Christmas break after another script was dropped by the series . The main conceit of the episode was " modern medicine versus backyards supernatural arts " . The episode featured several noted actors , including Billy Drago , who played the role of antagonist Orell Peattie , and James Morrison , who was a former cast member of the science fiction series Space : Above and Beyond , which was created by former X @-@ Files writers Glen Morgan and James Wong . Series creator Chris Carter later called the episode " very well cast " .

 Dr. Irving <unk> is staying the night with his daughter and her family in Marin County , California , including her husband Dr. Robert Wieder ( James Morrison ) . In the middle of the night , Irving finds a pile of dirt shaped like a man in his bed . Irving is eventually discovered by Robert hanging from the ceiling with the word " theef " painted in Irving 's blood on the wall . While investigating the next morning , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) notices the graveyard dirt in Irving 's bed and believes it may be caused by a hoodoo hex . Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , however , believes that the doctor committed suicide by slitting his own throat , writing on the wall , and hanging himself . After the autopsy , it is determined that Irving suffered from a prion disease called kuru , which has not been found in the United States before . Mulder believes that kuru was given to him by a hex that caused him to go mad . The <unk> then find a family photo missing from their bedroom , and a " hoodoo man " , later revealed to be named Orell Peattie ( Billy Drago ) , is seen placing the faces cut from the picture into various poppet dolls . Ms. Wieder collapses after another pile of graveyard dirt is found in her bed . Her skin then sprouts lesions as the " hoodoo man " stands by the pool talking to the doll . 
 Peattie visits Dr. Wieder at work , but refuses to tell him why he is committing these hexes against his family . Wieder does some research of his own and finds a bracelet in a Jane Doe file that he believes may be connected . Mulder consults an expert in the occult , who notes that , in order to commit hexes , the man must draw energy from a charm and place blood , hair and a picture of the victim inside a poppet in order to follow through with the hexes . Meanwhile , Mrs. Wieder is burned to death during Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , and the " hoodoo man " is found taking her doll out of the microwave . The word " theef " is also found branded in Mrs. Wieder 's chest . Dr. Wieder tells the agents that the man came to see him , and that he found a Jane Doe case that may be connected to the murders . After investigating , it is revealed that the Jane Doe was Lynnette Peattie who died last October during a bus crash . The doctor gave her an overdose of morphine , euthanizing her due to her pain . Mulder assumes the man is her father and that he feels the doctor stole his family away from him . Mulder decides to exhume the body of Lynette Peattie and move it to Virginia , taking away her father 's power , but when they exhume the casket there is no body inside . 
 Meanwhile , Peattie 's landlord sneaks into his apartment for pain medication and finds the body of Lynnette in his bed . Immediately , she contracts a flesh @-@ eating disease . After hearing about the incident on the news , Mulder goes to Peattie 's apartment and finds Lynnette 's headless body , but Peattie missing . Peattie finds the Wieder family , whom Scully is protecting , and makes a poppet with Scully 's hair and photo inside . He places nails in the doll 's eyes and Scully promptly goes blind . Peattie breaks into the house , takes Scully 's gun and stabs a poppet of Dr. Wieder , causing the doctor to collapse in pain . Mulder shows up , finds Scully 's doll and removes the nails from it , allowing her to regain her vision and shoot Peattie . He is placed in a coma and Lynnette 's body is shipped back to her home in West Virginia .

 Originally , the episode was not planned to be produced during the seventh season . However , just before the writing crew prepared to take their Christmas break , one of the scheduled scripts was removed from the line @-@ up . In order to meet the deadline , Frank Spotnitz , John Shiban , and Vince Gilligan decided to write a script about " modern medicine versus backyards supernatural arts " . Gilligan later joked that " I think I was enlisted for the fact that I 'm Southern , and they thought I was the closest thing they had to a hillbilly on the staff " . 
 Producer David Amann explained that the inspiration for the story was " What if you have a doctor who is prosperous but has a dark page from his past that comes back to haunt him ? " Spotnitz later elaborated that the story initially was " going to be how do you get rid of something you can 't get rid of " . However , the writers soon found this storyline difficult to develop , and , by Spotnitz 's own admission , the story " started to evolve into a Cape Fear type of situation " . The episode was finished by the writers over the Christmas break and then " handed over " to Kim Manners , who became the episode 's director . 
 = = = Casting , directing , and makeup = = = 
 Noted actor Billy Drago was brought in to play the role of Orell Peattie , a casting decision that series creator Chris Carter later called " especially lucky " . His son , Darren E. Burrows , had previously been cast as Bernard in a season six episode , Monday . Actor James Morrison , who played Dr. Wieder , was a former cast member of the science fiction series Space : Above and Beyond , and had previously been cast as detective Jim Horn in an episode of Millennium called " Dead Letters " . Both of these were written by former X @-@ Files writers Glen Morgan and James Wong . Leah Sanders , who was cast as the background character Reporter # 1 , was a childhood friend of John Shiban who had not been in contact for twenty years . Shiban was reportedly delighted to discover that his former friend had been coincidentally cast in the episode . Carter noted that the episode " was very well cast " . 
 Kim Manners later noted that " Theef " was difficult to shoot because the cast and crew had inadequate time to prepare . He explained , " It was kind of a rush thing and we got the script very late . We were totally winging it while we were shooting it " . Manners later stated that the episode " came together " in the editing room : " When I looked at the footage , it was like I was looking at somebody else 's film . But it cut together real nice and the end result was that ' Theef ' turned out to be a decent little episode " . Manners later admitted that the episode was his only credit for the series during which he experienced illness . With Manners out for a day due to his sickness , Rob Bowman took over directing duties for a day . 
 Cheri Montesanto @-@ Medcalf , one of the show 's makeup creators , was extremely pleased with Drago 's makeup in the episode . She later noted , " I remember Billy Drago was awesome – he looked so creepy after makeup . I just wanted this guy to look super @-@ creepy and disturbing to look at , but real enough that you might be scared if you looked out your window at night and saw him standing there " .

 " Theef " first aired in the United States on March 12 , 2000 .

Fox promoted the episode with the tagline " Voodoo curse ? Tonight , the dark powers of black magic have chosen their next victim ... Agent Scully . " The episode was nominated and won a 2000 Emmy Award by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for Outstanding Makeup for a Series . 
 Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B + " , and called it " the strongest straight @-@ up , non @-@ experimental standalone the season ’ s had so far , " as well as one of " the strongest ' scary ' episode since season five . " He praised the guest cast — mostly notably Drago and Morrison — and wrote that the writers of the episode were able to successfully make the character deaths in the episode count in a way that moved the audience . VanDerWerff 's main criticism of the episode was that it painted Peattie " as a backwoods hick and a rather broad stereotype of one . " Tom Kessenich , in his book Examinations , gave the episode a moderately positive review . Despite slightly criticizing the episode utilizing a voodoo @-@ based plot , which he called " [ not ] terribly original " , he concluded that " there 's nothing wrong with a little modern medicine vs. practical magic confrontation . And I definitely enjoyed how Scully had her envelope pushed once again " . Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars , noting , " writer Vince Gilligan gets fairly serious in this ep concerning a series of deadly hexes cast upon a doctor and his family , as well as some cryptic <unk> . There 's plenty of bad mojo going around as the X @-@ Files team gets to dig deep into the dark side of the magick arts , with Scully at one point losing her sight , thanks to a vengeful hex doll .

 = Frederick Russell Burnham = 
 Frederick Russell Burnham DSO ( May 11 , 1861 – September 1 , 1947 ) was an American scout and world @-@ traveling adventurer . He is known for his service to the British South Africa Company and to the British Army in colonial Africa , and for teaching woodcraft to Robert Baden @-@ Powell in Rhodesia . He helped inspire the founding of the international Scouting Movement . 
 Burnham was born on a Lakota Sioux Indian reservation in Minnesota where he learned the ways of American Indians as a boy . By the age of 14 , he was supporting himself in California , while also learning scouting from some of the last of the cowboys and frontiersmen of the American Southwest . Burnham had little formal education , never finishing high school . After moving to the Arizona Territory in the early 1880s , he was drawn into the Pleasant Valley War , a feud between families of ranchers and sheepherders . He escaped and later worked as a civilian tracker for the United States Army in the Apache Wars . Feeling the need for new adventures , Burnham took his family to southern Africa in 1893 , seeing Cecil Rhodes 's Cape to Cairo Railway project as the next undeveloped frontier . 
 Burnham distinguished himself in several battles in Rhodesia and South Africa and became Chief of Scouts . Despite his U.S. citizenship , his military title was British and his rank of major was formally given to him by King Edward VII . In special recognition of Burnham 's heroism , the King invested him into the Companions of the Distinguished Service Order , giving Burnham the highest military honors earned by any American in the Second Boer War . He had become friends with Baden @-@ Powell during the Second Matabele War in Rhodesia , teaching him outdoor skills and inspiring what would later become known as Scouting . Burnham returned to the United States , where he became involved in national defense efforts , business , oil , conservation , and the Boy Scouts of America ( BSA ) . 
 During World War I , Burnham was selected as an officer and recruited volunteers for a U.S. Army division similar to the Rough Riders , which Theodore Roosevelt intended to lead into France . For political reasons , the unit was disbanded without seeing action . After the war , Burnham and his business partner John Hays Hammond formed the Burnham Exploration Company ; they became wealthy from oil discovered in California . Burnham joined several new wilderness conservation organizations , including the California State Parks Commission . In the 1930s , he worked with the BSA to save the big horn sheep from extinction . This effort led to the creation of the <unk> and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuges in Arizona . He earned the BSA 's highest honor , the Silver Buffalo Award , in 1936 , and remained active in the organization at both the regional and national level until his death in 1947 . To symbolise the friendship between Burnham and Baden @-@ Powell , the mountain beside Mount Baden @-@ Powell in California was formally named Mount Burnham in 1951 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Burnham was born on May 11 , 1861 on a Lakota Sioux Indian reservation in Minnesota , to a missionary family living near the small pioneer town of Tivoli ( now gone ) , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) from Mankato . His father , the Reverend Edwin Otway Burnham , was a Presbyterian minister educated and ordained in New York ; he was born in Ghent , Kentucky . His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in Iowa , having emigrated with her family from Westminster , England at the age of three . In the Dakota War of 1862 , Chief Little Crow and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town New Ulm , Minnesota ; Burnham 's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time , so when Burnham 's mother saw Sioux approaching her cabin dressed in war paint , she knew she had to leave and could never escape carrying her baby . She hid Frederick in a basket of green corn husks in a corn field and fled for her life . Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed , she returned to find their house burned down , but the baby Frederick was safe , fast asleep in the basket with the corn husks . 
 The young Burnham attended schools in Iowa . There he met Blanche Blick , whom he later married . The Burnham family moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles , California in 1870 , in search of easier living conditions soon after Edwin was seriously injured in an accident while rebuilding the family homestead . Two years later , Edwin died , leaving the family destitute . Burnham 's mother and 3 @-@ year @-@ old younger brother Howard returned to Iowa to live with her parents ; the 12 @-@ year @-@ old Burnham remained in California alone to repay his family 's debts and ultimately make his own way . 
 For the next few years , Burnham worked as a mounted messenger for the Western Union Telegraph Company in California and Arizona Territory . On one occasion his horse was stolen from him by Tiburcio Vásquez , a famous Californio bandit . At 14 , he began his life as a scout and Indian tracker in the Apache Wars , during which he took part in the United States Army expedition to find and capture or kill the Apache chief Geronimo . In Prescott , Arizona , he met an old scout named Lee who served under General George Crook . Lee taught Burnham how to track Apache by detecting the odor of burning <unk> , a species of aloe they often cooked and ate . With careful study of the local air currents and canyons , trackers could follow the odor to Apache hiding places from as far away as 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) . During the Apache uprisings , the young Burnham also learned much from Al Sieber , the Chief of Scouts , and his assistant Archie McIntosh , who had been Chief of Scouts in Crook 's last two campaigns . Burnham learned much about scouting from these Indian trackers , who were advanced in age and fading from the frontier , including the vital lesson that " it is imperative that a scout should know the history , tradition , religion , social customs , and superstitions of whatever country or people he is called on to work in or among . " But the scout who was to have perhaps the greatest influence on Burnham during his formative years was a man named Holmes . 
 Holmes had served under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont , but he was old and physically impaired when he met Burnham . He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart his knowledge of the frontier to the young Burnham . The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico , and Holmes taught him many scouting skills , such as how to track a trail , how to double and cover one 's own trail , how to properly ascend and descend precipices , and how to tell the time at night . Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes , such as where to find water in the desert , how to protect himself from snakes , and what to do in case of forest fires or floods . A stickler for details , Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things , such as braiding a rope , tying a knot , or putting on or taking off a saddle , there is a right way and a wrong way . The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting . Burnham also worked as a cowboy , a guard for the mines , a guide , and a scout during these years . 
 In Globe , Arizona , Burnham unwittingly joined the losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started , and only narrowly escaped death . He had no stake in the feud , but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family . Once the killing started , he felt he had to join a faction as a hired gun , although it put him on the wrong side of the law . In between raids and forays , he practiced incessantly with his pistol ; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse . Even after his faction admitted defeat ( the feud would begin again years later ) , Burnham still had many enemies . 
 During this time he met " a fine , hard riding young Kansan , who I had met on an Indian raid and whose nerve I greatly admired . " The young Kansan , who had been swindled by an unscrupulous superintendent of mines , had a plan to rustle cattle and horses from the superintendent and sell them to Curly Bill ( William Brocius ) , an outlaw with whom he had indirectly been in contact . Both men were broke at the time , and the job sounded easy . But Burnham had always rejected the life of a thief and even as a wanted man , he did not view himself as a criminal . Burnham began to see that even though he joined the feud to help his friends , he had been in the wrong , that " avenging only led to more vengeance and to even greater injustice than that suffered through the often unjustly administered laws of the land . " 
 Burnham decided to reject the offer of the young Kansan ( who followed through with the plan and was later killed ) , and that he needed to leave the Tonto Basin . Judge Aaron Hackney , editor of the local Arizona Silver Belt newspaper and a friend , helped him escape to Tombstone , Arizona with the assistance of Neil McLeod . He was a well @-@ known prizefighter in Tombstone and one of the most successful smugglers along the Arizona – Mexico frontier . The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral had occurred only a few months earlier , but as Tombstone was a boomtown attracting new silver miners from all parts , it was an ideal location to hide out . Burnham assumed several aliases and occasionally he delivered messages for McLeod and his smuggler partners in Sonora , Mexico . From McLeod , he learned many valuable tricks for avoiding detection , passing coded messages , and throwing off pursuers . 
 Burnham eventually went back to California to attend high school , but he never graduated . He returned to Arizona and was appointed Deputy Sheriff of Pinal County , but he soon went back to herding cattle and prospecting . After he went to Prescott , Iowa to visit his childhood sweetheart Blanche , the two were married on February 6 , 1884 . He was 23 years old . He and Blanche settled down soon after in Pasadena , California , to tend to an orange grove but soon Burnham returned to prospecting and scouting . Active as a Freemason , he rose to become a Thirty @-@ Second Degree Mason of the Scottish Rite . 
 During the 1880s , sections of the American press popularized the notion that the West had been won and there was nothing left to conquer in the United States . The time when great scouts like Kit Carson , Daniel Boone , and Davy Crockett could explore and master the wild and uncharted Western territories was coming to a close . Contemporary scouts such as Buffalo Bill , Wild Bill Hickok , and Texas Jack <unk> , were leaving the old West to become entertainers , and they battled great Native American chiefs like Sitting Bull , Chief Joseph , and Geronimo only in Wild West Shows . In 1890 the United States Census Bureau formally closed the American frontier , ending the system under which land in the Western territories had been sold cheaply to pioneers . As a " soldier of fortune " , as Richard Harding Davis later called him , Burnham began to look elsewhere for the next undeveloped frontier , feeling that the American West was becoming tame and unchallenging . When he heard of the work of Cecil Rhodes and his pioneers in southern Africa , who were working to build a railway across Africa from Cape to Cairo , Burnham sold what little he owned . In 1893 with his wife and young son , he set sail for Durban in South Africa , intending to join Rhodes 's pioneers in Matabeleland and Mashonaland .

 Burnham was trekking the 1 @,@ 000 miles ( 1 @,@ 609 km ) north from Durban to Matabeleland with his wife and son , an American buckboard and six donkeys when war broke out between Rhodes 's British South Africa Company and the Matabele ( or Ndebele ) King Lobengula in late 1893 . He signed up to scout for the Company immediately on reaching Matabeleland , and joined the fighting . Leander Starr Jameson , the Company 's Chief Magistrate in Mashonaland , hoped to defeat the Matabele quickly by capturing Lobengula at his royal town of Bulawayo , and so sent Burnham and a small group of scouts ahead to report on the situation there . While on the outskirts of town they watched as the Matabele burned down and destroyed everything in sight . By the time the Company troops had arrived in force , Lobengula and his warriors had fled and there was little left of old Bulawayo . The Company then moved into the remains of Bulawayo , established a base , and sent out patrols to find Lobengula . The most famous of these patrols was the Shangani Patrol , led by Major Allan Wilson and the man he chose as his Chief of Scouts , Fred Burnham . 
 = = = = Shangani Patrol = = = = 
 Jameson sent a column of soldiers under Major Patrick Forbes to locate and capture Lobengula . The column camped on the south bank of the Shangani River about 25 miles ( 40 km ) north @-@ east of the village of <unk> on the evening of December 3 , 1893 . The next day , late in the afternoon , a dozen men under the command of Major Wilson were sent across the river to patrol the area . The Wilson Patrol came across a group of Matabele women and children who claimed to know Lobengula 's whereabouts . Burnham , who served as the lead scout of the Wilson Patrol , sensed a trap and advised Wilson to withdraw , but Wilson ordered his patrol to advance . 
 Soon afterwards , the patrol found the king and Wilson sent a message back to the laager requesting reinforcements . Forbes , however , was unwilling to set off across the river in the dark , so he sent only 20 more men , under the command of Henry Borrow , to reinforce Wilson 's patrol . Forbes intended to send the main body of troops and artillery across the river the following morning ; however , the main column was ambushed by Matabele warriors and delayed . Wilson 's patrol too came under attack , but the Shangani River had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat . In desperation , Wilson sent Burnham and two other men , Pearl " Pete " Ingram ( a Montana cowboy ) and William Gooding ( an Australian ) , to cross the Shangani River , find Forbes , and bring reinforcements . In spite of a shower of bullets and spears , the three made it to Forbes , but the battle raging there was just as intense as the one they had left , and there was no hope of anyone reaching Wilson in time . As Burnham loaded his rifle to beat back the Matabele warriors , he quietly said to Forbes , " I think I may say that we are the sole survivors of that party . " Wilson , Borrow , and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of Matabele warriors ; escape was impossible , and all were killed . 
 Colonial @-@ era histories called this the Shangani Patrol , and hailed Wilson and Borrow as national heroes . Their last stand together became a kind of national myth , as Lewis Gann writes , " a glorious memory , [ Rhodesia 's ] own equivalent of the bloody Alamo massacre and Custer 's Last Stand in the American West " . The version of events recorded by history is based on the accounts of Burnham , Ingram and Gooding , the Matabele present at the battle ( particularly inDuna Mjaan ) , and the men of Forbes ' column . While all of the direct evidence given by eyewitnesses supports the findings of the Court of Inquiry , some historians and writers debate whether or not Burnham , Ingram and Gooding really were sent back by Wilson to fetch help , and suggest that they might have simply deserted when the battle got rough . The earliest recording of this claim of desertion is long after the event in a letter written in 1935 by John Coghlan to a friend , John Carruthers , that " a very reliable man informed me that <unk> @-@ Sampson told him " that Gooding had confessed on his deathbed that he and the two Americans had not actually been despatched by Wilson , and had simply left on their own accord . This double hearsay confession , coming from an anonymous source , is not mentioned in Gooding 's 1899 obituary , which instead recounts the events as generally recorded . Several well @-@ known writers have used the Coghlan letter , as shaky as it is , as clearance to create hypothetical evidence in an attempt to challenge and revise the historical record . 
 For his service in the war , Burnham was presented the British South Africa Company Medal , a gold watch , and a share of a 300 acre ( 120 ha ) tract of land in Matabeleland . It was here that Burnham uncovered many artifacts in the huge granite ruins of the ancient civilization of Great Zimbabwe . Matabeleland became part of the Company domain , which was formally named Rhodesia , after Rhodes , in 1895 . Matabeleland and Mashonaland became collectively called Southern Rhodesia . 
 = = = Northern Rhodesia Exploration = = = 
 In 1895 , Burnham oversaw and led the Northern Territories British South Africa Exploration Company expedition that first established for the British South Africa Company that major copper deposits existed north of the Zambezi in North @-@ Eastern Rhodesia . Along the Kafue River , Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in the United States , and he encountered native peoples wearing copper bracelets . After this expedition he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society . Later , the British South Africa Company built the mining towns of the Copperbelt and a railroad to transport the ore through Portuguese Mozambique . 
 = = = Second Matabele War = = = 
 In March 1896 , the Matabele again rose up against the British South Africa Company administration in what became called the Second Matabele War or the First Chimurenga ( liberation war ) . Mlimo , the Matabele spiritual leader , is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation . The colonists ' defenses in Matabeleland were undermanned due to the ill @-@ fated Jameson Raid into the South African Republic ( or Transvaal ) , and in the first few months of the war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed . With few troops to support them , the settlers quickly built a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such figures as Burnham , Robert Baden @-@ Powell , and Frederick Selous . The Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the Matopos Hills near Bulawayo , a region that became the scene of the fiercest fighting between Matabele warriors and settler patrols . It was also during this war that two scouts of very different backgrounds , Burnham and Baden @-@ Powell , would first meet and discuss ideas for training youth that would eventually become the plan for the program and the code of honor for the Boy Scouts . 
 = = = = Assassination of Mlimo = = = = 
 The turning point in the war came when Burnham and Bonar Armstrong , a Company native commissioner , found their way through the Matopos Hills to a sacred cave not many miles from the <unk> district , to a sanctuary then known only to the Matabele where Mlimo had been hiding . Not far from the cave was a village ( now gone ) of about 100 huts filled with many warriors . The two men tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their bellies , screening their slow , cautious movements by means of branches held before them . Once inside the cave , they waited until Mlimo entered . Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old , with very dark skin , sharp @-@ featured ; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel , crafty look . Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity , at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart , killing him . 
 Burnham and Armstrong leapt over the dead Mlimo and ran down a trail toward their horses . The warriors in the village nearby picked up their arms and searched for the attackers ; to distract them , Burnham set fire to some of their huts . The whites escaped and rode back to Bulawayo . Shortly after , Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Matabele stronghold and made peace with the rebels , ending the Second Matabele War . 
 = = = Klondike Gold Rush = = = 
 With the Matabele wars over , Burnham decided it was time to leave Africa and move on to other adventures . The family returned to California . Soon after , Fred traveled to Alaska and the Yukon to prospect in the Klondike Gold Rush , taking with him his eldest son Roderick , who was then 12 years old . On hearing of the Spanish – American War , Burnham rushed home to volunteer his services , but the war had ended before he could get to the fighting . Burnham returned to the Klondike having played no part in the war . Colonel Theodore Roosevelt regretted this as much as Burnham and paid him a great tribute in his book . 
 = = = Second Boer War = = = 
 The Second Boer War ( October 1899 – May 1902 ) was fought between the British and two independent Boer republics , the South African Republic and the Orange Free State , partly the result of long @-@ simmering strife between them . It was directly caused by each side 's desire to control the lucrative Witwatersrand gold mines in the Transvaal . Field Marshal Frederick Roberts , one of the British Army 's most successful commanders of the 19th century , was appointed to take overall command of British forces , relieving General Redvers Buller , following a number of Boer successes in the early weeks of the war , including the Siege of Mafeking , in which Baden @-@ Powell , his small regiment of men , and the townspeople had been besieged by thousands of Boer troops since the conflict began . Roberts asked General Frederick Carrington , who had commanded the British forces in Matabeleland three years earlier , whom he should appoint as his Chief of Scouts in South Africa . Carrington had selected Burnham for this role and advised Roberts to do the same , describing Burnham as " the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa . " 
 Roberts sent for Burnham soon after arriving in South Africa on the RMS <unk> Castle . The American scout was prospecting near Skagway , Alaska , when he received the following telegram in January 1900 : " Lord Roberts appoints you on his personal staff as Chief of Scouts . If you accept , come at once the quickest way possible . " Cape Town is at the opposite end of the globe from the Klondike , so Burnham left immediately . In an unusual step for a foreigner , Burnham received a command post from Roberts and the British Army rank of captain . Burnham reached the front just before the Battle of Paardeberg ( February 1900 ) . During the war , Burnham spent much time behind the Boer lines gathering information and blowing up railway bridges and tracks . He was captured twice ( escaping both times ) , and also temporarily disabled at one point by near @-@ fatal wounds . 
 Burnham was first captured during the fighting at Sanna 's Post in the Orange Free State . He gave himself up in order to obtain information on the enemy , which he did , and then he escaped from his guards and succeed in reaching British occupied Bloemfontein safely after two days and nights on the run . The second time he was captured was while trying to warn a British column approaching <unk> ' <unk> . He came upon a group of Boers hiding on the banks of the river , toward which the British were even then advancing . Cut off from his own side , Burnham chose to signal the approaching soldiers even though it would expose him to capture . With a red <unk> , Burnham signaled the soldiers to turn back , but the column paid no attention and <unk> steadily on into the ambush , while Burnham was at once taken prisoner . In the fight that followed , Burnham pretended to receive a wound in the knee , limping heavily and groaning with pain . He was placed in a wagon with the officers who really were wounded and who , in consequence , were not closely guarded . Later that evening , Burnham slipped over the driver 's seat , dropped between the two wheels of the wagon , lowered himself , and fell between the legs of the oxen on his back in the road . In an instant , the wagon had passed over him safely , and while the dust still hung above the trail he rolled rapidly over into the ditch at the side of the road and lay motionless . It was four days before he was able to re @-@ enter the British lines , during which time he had been lying in the open veld . He had subsisted on one biscuit and two handfuls of " <unk> " ( i.e. , maize ) . 
 On June 2 , 1900 , during the British march on Pretoria , Burnham was wounded , almost fatally . He was on a mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and supplies to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria . He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria @-@ Delagoa Bay railway line . He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge , an ideal location to disrupt the trains , but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers . Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell , knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body . It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot , so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed . When he awoke hours later , Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries . In spite of his acute agony , Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway , placed his charges , and blew up the line in two places . He then crept on his hands and knees to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible . The next day , Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction . By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him . Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood @-@ vessel . His very survival was due only to the fact that he had been without food or water for three days . 
 Burnham 's injuries were so serious that he was ordered to England by Lord Roberts . Two days before leaving for London , he was promoted to the rank of major , having received letters of commendation or congratulations from Baden @-@ Powell , Rhodes , and Field Marshal Roberts . On his arrival in England , Burnham was commanded to dine with Queen Victoria and to spend the night at Osborne House . A few months later , after the Queen 's death , King Edward VII personally presented Burnham with the Queen 's South Africa Medal with four bars for the battles at <unk> ( March 10 , 1900 ) , Johannesburg ( May 31 , 1900 ) , Paardeberg ( February 17 – 26 , 1900 ) , and Cape Colony ( October 11 , 1899 – May 31 , 1902 ) , in addition to the cross of the Distinguished Service Order , the second highest decoration in the British Army , for his heroism during the " victorious " march to Pretoria ( June 2 – 5 , 1900 ) . The King also made his British Army appointment and rank permanent , in spite of his U.S. citizenship . Burnham received the highest awards of any American who served in the Second Boer War . Following his investiture , the British press hailed him as : " The King of Army Scouts " . 
 Burnham 's most accomplished soldiers during the Second Boer War were the Lovat Scouts , a Scottish Highland regiment he commanded , whom he described as " half wolf and half jackrabbit . " Formed by Lord Lovat in 1899 , this yeomanry unit was the first to wear <unk> suits , a type of camouflage clothing developed to resemble heavy foliage . These scouts were well practiced in the arts of marksmanship , field craft , and tactics . After the war , the Lovat Scouts went on to become the British army 's first sniper unit . 
 = = " Father of Scouting " = = 
 Burnham was already a celebrated scout when he first befriended Baden @-@ Powell during the Second Matabele War , but the backgrounds of these two scouts was as strange a contrast as it is possible to imagine . From his youth on the open plains , Burnham 's earliest playmates were Sioux Indian boys and their ambitions pointed to excelling in the lore and arts of the trail and together they dreamed of some day becoming great scouts . When Burnham was a teenager he supported himself by hunting game and making long rides for Western Union through the California deserts , his early mentors were wise old scouts of the American West , and by 19 he was a seasoned scout chasing and being chased by Apache . The British scout he would later befriend and serve with in Matabeleland , Baden @-@ Powell , was born in London and had graduated from Charterhouse , one of England 's most famous public schools . Baden @-@ Powell developed an ambition to become a scout at an early age . He passed an exam that gave him an immediate commission into the British Army when he was 19 , but it would take several years before he was engaged in any active service . When the two men met in 1896 , Baden @-@ Powell was an army intelligence officer and a brilliant outdoorsman who had organized a small scouting section in his regiment , written a book called Reconnaissance and Scouting ( 1884 ) and served in India , Afghanistan , Natal and Ashanti . Burnham , meanwhile , was General Carrington 's Chief of Scouts . 
 During the siege of Bulawayo , these two men rode many times into the Matopos Hills on patrol , and it was in these hills that Burnham first introduced Baden @-@ Powell to the ways and methods of the Native Americans , and taught him " woodcraft " ( better known today as Scoutcraft ) . Baden @-@ Powell had written at length about reconnaissance and tracking , but from Burnham he learned many new dimensions such as how to travel in wild country without either a compass or map , how to discover nearby dangers by observing animals , and the many techniques for finding potable water . So impressed was Baden @-@ Powell by Burnham 's Scouting spirit that he closely listened to all he had to tell . It was also here that Baden @-@ Powell began to wear his signature Stetson campaign hat and neckerchief , like those worn by Burnham , for the first time . Both men recognized that wars were changing markedly and that the British Army needed to adapt . During their joint scouting missions , Baden @-@ Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training program in woodcraft for young men , rich in exploration , tracking , fieldcraft , and self @-@ reliance . In Africa , no scout embodied these traits more than Burnham . 
 In his first scouting handbook , Aids to Scouting ( 1899 ) , Baden @-@ Powell published many of the lessons he learned from Burnham and this book was later used by boys ' groups as a guide to outdoor fun . At the urging of several youth leaders , Baden @-@ Powell decided to adapt his scouting handbook specifically to training boys . While Baden @-@ Powell went on to refine the concept of Scouting , publish Scouting for Boys ( 1908 ) , and become the founder of the international Scouting movement , Burnham has been called the movement 's father . James E. West , Chief Scout Executive for the Boy Scouts of America ( BSA ) , summarized Burnham 's historical relevance to Scouting : " There is an especial significance for those of us in Scouting in this man 's list , for he was engaged for this work by Lord Baden Powell , who was then connected with the British Army in Africa , and who had unbounded admiration for the scouting methods of Frederick Burnham . So these two pioneers , each of whom was to have such immeasurable influence in restoring the old traditions of American youth , met in Africa , years before the Scouting movement was ever thought of . " 
 Burnham later became close friends with others involved in the Scouting movement in the United States , such as Theodore Roosevelt , the Chief Scout Citizen , and Gifford Pinchot , the Chief Scout Forester , and E. B. DeGroot , BSA Scout Executive of Los Angeles . DeGroot said of Burnham : " Here is the sufficient and heroic figure , model and living example , who inspired and gave Baden @-@ Powell the plan for the program and the code of honor of Scouting for Boys . " With assistance from Baden @-@ Powell , the BSA published his biography : He @-@ who @-@ sees @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark ; the Boys ' Story of Frederick Burnham , the American Scout . The BSA made Burnham an Honorary Scout in 1927 , and for his noteworthy and extraordinary service to the Scouting movement , Burnham was bestowed the highest commendation given by the BSA , the Silver Buffalo Award , in 1936 . Throughout his life he remained active in Scouting at both the regional and the national level in the United States and he corresponded regularly with Baden @-@ Powell on Scouting topics . 
 Burnham and Baden @-@ Powell remained close friends for their long lives . Burnham called Baden @-@ Powell a " wonderfully able scout " , and nicknamed him " Sherlock Holmes . " Baden @-@ Powell considered Burnham to be " the greatest scout alive . " The seal on the Burnham – Baden @-@ Powell letters at Yale and Stanford expired in 2000 and the true depth of their friendship and love of Scouting has again been revealed . In 1931 , Burnham read the speech dedicating Mount Baden @-@ Powell , California , to his old Scouting friend . Their friendship , and equal status in the world of Scouting and conservation , was honored in 1951 with the dedication of the adjoining peak as Mount Burnham . 
 Burnham 's descendants followed in his footsteps and are active in Scouting and in the military . His son Roderick enlisted in the U.S. Army and he fought in France in World War I. His grandson , Frederick Russell Burnham II , was a leader in the BSA and a Vietnam War veteran . His great @-@ grandson , Russell Adam Burnham , is an Eagle Scout and was the United States Army 's Soldier of the Year in 2003 .

 After convalescing , Burnham became the London office manager for the Wa Syndicate , a commercial body with interests in the Gold Coast and neighboring territories in West Africa . He led the Wa Syndicate 's 1901 expedition through the Gold Coast and the Upper Volta , looking for minerals and ways to improve river navigation . Between 1902 and 1904 he was employed by the East Africa Syndicate , for which he led a vast mineral prospecting expedition in the East Africa Protectorate ( Kenya ) . Traveling extensively in the area around Lake Rudolf ( now Lake Turkana ) , he discovered a huge soda lake . 
 = = = Mexico = = = 
 Burnham returned to North America and for the next few years became associated with the Yaqui River irrigation project in Mexico . While investigating the Yaqui valley for mineral and agricultural resources , Burnham reasoned that a dam could provide year @-@ round water to rich alluvial soil in the valley ; turning the region into one of the garden spots of the world and generate much needed electricity . He purchased water rights and some 300 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 km2 ) of land in this region and contacted an old friend from his time in Africa , John Hays Hammond , who conducted his own studies and then purchased an additional 900 @,@ 000 acres ( 3 @,@ 600 km2 ) of this land — an area the size of Rhode Island . Burnham together with Charles Frederick Holder made important archaeological discoveries of Mayan civilization in this region , including the Esperanza Stone . 
 In 1909 , William Howard Taft and Porfirio Díaz planned a summit in El Paso , Texas , and Ciudad Juárez , Mexico , an historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico . But tensions rose on both sides of the border , including threats of assassination , so the Texas Rangers , 4 @,@ 000 U.S. and Mexican troops , U.S. Secret Service agents , FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security . Burnham was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by Hammond , who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice @-@ Presidential candidate in 1908 . On October 16 , the day of the summit , Burnham and Private C.R. Moore , a Texas Ranger , discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route . Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and Díaz . 
 After the Taft @-@ Díaz summit , Burnham led a team of 500 men in guarding mining properties owned by Hammond , J. P. Morgan , and the <unk> in the Mexican state of Sonora . Just as the irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912 , a long series of Mexican revolutions began . The final blow to these efforts came in 1917 when Mexico passed laws prohibiting the sale of land to foreigners . Burnham and Hammond carried their properties until 1930 and then sold them to the Mexican government . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 During this period , Burnham was one of the 18 officers selected by former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt to raise a volunteer infantry division for service in France in 1917 shortly after the United States entered the war . A plan to raise volunteer soldiers from the Western U.S. came out of a meeting of the New York @-@ based Rocky Mountain Club and Burnham was put in charge of both the general organization and recruitment . Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise up to four divisions similar to the Rough Riders of 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry Regiment and to the British Army 25th ( Frontiersmen ) Battalion , Royal Fusiliers ; however , as Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , President Woodrow Wilson refused to make use of Roosevelt 's volunteers . 
 Roosevelt had been an outspoken critic of Wilson 's neutrality policies , so even though Roosevelt had made several attempts to come to an agreement with Wilson , the President was unwilling to accept any compromise . In an astute political maneuver , Wilson announced to the press that he would not send Roosevelt and his volunteers to France , but instead would send an American Expeditionary Force under the command of General John Pershing . Roosevelt was left with no option except to disband the volunteers . He never forgave Wilson , and quickly published The Foes Of Our Own Household , a harsh indictment of the sitting president . These relentless attacks helped the Republicans win control of Congress in 1918 . Roosevelt might have been a serious candidate for president in 1920 , but lingering malaria kept him out of the race . 
 During World War I , Burnham was living in California and was active in counterespionage for Britain . Much of it involved a famous Boer spy , Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne , who became a German spy in both World Wars and claimed to have killed Field Marshal Kitchener while en route to meet with the Russians . During the Second Boer War , Burnham and Duquesne were each under orders to assassinate the other , but it was not until 1910 that the two men first met while both were in Washington , D.C. , separately lobbying Congress to pass a bill in favor of the importation of African game animals into the United States ( H.R. <unk> ) . Duquesne was twice arrested by the FBI and in 1942 he and 32 other Nazi agents ( the Duquesne Spy Ring ) were jailed for espionage in the largest spy ring conviction in U.S. history . 
 = = = Oil wealth = = = 
 Although Burnham had lived all over the world , he never had a great deal of wealth to show for his efforts . It was not until he returned to California , the place of his youth , that he found great affluence . In November 1923 , he struck oil in Dominguez Hills , near Carson , California . In a field that covered just two square miles , over 150 wells from Union Oil were soon producing 37 @,@ 000 barrels a day , with 10 @,@ 000 barrels a day going to the Burnham Exploration Company , a syndicate formed in 1919 between Frederick Burnham , his son Roderick , John Hayes Hammond , and his son Harris Hammond . In the first 10 years of operation , the Burnham Exploration Company paid out $ 10 @.@ 2 million in dividends . The spot where Burnham found oil was land where " as a small boy he used to graze cattle , and shoot game which he sold to the neighboring mining districts to support his widowed mother and infant brother . " Many years after the oil was depleted , the land near the Dominguez field was re @-@ developed and became the site of the California State University , Dominguez Hills . In 2010 , Occidental Petroleum Corporation expressed interest in redeveloping the former Dominguez oil field using modern extraction technologies . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 An avid conservationist and hunter , Burnham supported the early conservation programs of his friends Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot . He and his associate John Hayes Hammond led novel game expeditions to Africa with the goal of finding large animals such as Giant Eland , hippopotamus , zebra , and various bird species that might be bred in the United States and become game for future American sportsmen . Burnham , Hammond , and Duquesne appeared several times before the House Committee on Agriculture to ask for help in importing large African animals . In 1914 , he helped establish the Wild Life Protective League of America , Department of Southern California , and served as its first Secretary . 
 In his later years , Burnham filled various public offices and also served as a member of the Boone and Crockett Club of New York , and as a founding member of the American Committee for International Wildlife Protection ( now a committee of the World Conservation Union ) . He was one of the original members of the first California State Parks Commission ( serving from 1927 to 1934 ) , a founding member of the Save @-@ the @-@ Redwoods League , president of the Southwest Museum of Los Angeles from 1938 until 1940 , and he served as both the Honorary President of the Arizona Boy Scouts and as a regional executive for the BSA throughout the 1940s until his death in 1947 . 
 In 1936 , Burnham enlisted the Arizona Boy Scouts in a campaign to save the Desert Bighorn Sheep from probable extinction . Several other prominent <unk> and environmental groups joined the movement and a " save the <unk> " poster contest was started in schools throughout the state . Burnham provided prizes and appeared in store windows from one end of Arizona to the other . The contest @-@ winning bighorn emblem was made into neckerchief slides for the 10 @,@ 000 Boy Scouts , and talks and dramatizations were given at school assemblies and on radio . On January 18 , 1939 , over 1 @.@ 5 million acres ( 6 @,@ 100 km2 ) were set aside in Arizona to establish the <unk> National Wildlife Refuge and the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge , and Burnham gave the dedication speech . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 At 5 ft 4 in ( 1 @.@ 62 m ) , Burnham was slight , but he was also muscular and bronzed , with a finely formed square jaw . He had a boyish appearance which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions . His most noticeable feature was his steady , grey @-@ blue eyes . Contemporary reports had it that Burnham 's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at , and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings . It was also said that Burnham 's eyes possessed a far @-@ away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains . 
 Burnham would not smoke and seldom drank alcohol , fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of his sense of smell . He found ways to train himself in mental patience , took power naps instead of indulging in periods of long sleep , and drank very little liquid . He trained himself to accept these <unk> in order to endure the most appalling fatigues , hunger , thirst , and wounds , so that when scouting or traveling where there was no water , he might still be able to exist . On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died , or were in fact dying , of exhaustion . He was quiet @-@ mannered and courteous , according to contemporaries . Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self @-@ conscious , who was extremely modest , and who seldom spoke of his many adventures . 
 Burnham died of heart failure at the age of 86 , on September 1 , 1947 at his home in Santa , Barbara , California . He was buried at a private ceremony at Three Rivers , California , near his old cattle ranch , La Cuesta . His memorial stone was designed by his only surviving child , Roderick . Also buried at Three Rivers cemetery are his first wife , Blanche , several members of the Blick family who had also pioneered 1890s Rhodesia with Burnham , Roderick , his granddaughter Martha Burnham Burleigh , and " Pete " Ingram , the Montana cowboy who had survived the Shangani Patrol massacre along with Burnham . 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Burnham 's wife of 55 years , Blanche ( February 25 , 1862 – December 22 , 1939 ) of Nevada , Iowa , accompanied him in very primitive conditions through many travels in both the Southwest United States and southern Africa . Together they had three children , all of whom spent their early youth in Africa . In the early years , she watched over the children and the pack animals , and she always kept a rifle nearby . In the dark of night , she used her rifle many times against lions and hyena and , during the Siege of Bulawayo , against Matabele warriors . Several members of the Blick family joined the Burnhams in Rhodesia , moved with them to England , and returned to the United States with the Burnhams to live near Three Rivers , California . When Burnham Exploration Company struck it rich in 1923 , the Burnhams moved to a mansion built by Pasadena architect Joseph Blick , his brother @-@ in @-@ law , in a new housing development then known as <unk> ( a name later shortened to " Hollywood " ) and took many trips around the world in high style . In 1939 , Blanche suffered a stroke . She died a month later and was buried in the Three Rivers Cemetery . 
 Burnham 's first son , Roderick ( August 22 , 1886 – July 2 , 1976 ) , was born in Pasadena , California , but accompanied the family to Africa and learned the Matabele language , Sindebele . He went to boarding school in France in 1895 , and then to a military school in England the following year . In 1898 , he went to Skagway , Alaska with his father , and returned to Pasadena the next year . In 1904 , he attended the University of California , Berkeley , joined the football team , but left Berkeley after a dispute with his coach . In 1905 – 08 , he went to the University of Arizona , joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity , played the position of running back , and became the captain of the football team . He attended the Michigan School of Mines ( now Michigan Technological University ) in 1910 , became a geologist , and worked for Union Oil as Manager of Lands and Foreign Exploration helping to develop the first wells in Mexico and Venezuela . He took time off from his job to serve in the U.S. Army in World War I and fought in France . He and his father became minority owners of the Burnham Exploration Company , incorporated in 1919 by Harris Hays Hammond ( the son of John Hays Hammond , Sr ) . In 1930 , he and Paramount Pictures founder W. W. <unk> started the Central American Aviation Corporation , the first airline in Guatemala . 
 Nada ( May 1894 – May 19 , 1896 ) , Burnham 's daughter , was the first white child born in Bulawayo ; she died of fever and starvation during the town 's siege . She was buried three days later in the town 's Pioneer Cemetery , plot No. 144 . Nada is the Zulu word for lily and she was named after the heroine in Sir H. Rider Haggard 's Zulu tale , Nada the Lily ( 1892 ) . Three of Haggard 's books are dedicated to Burnham 's daughter , Nada : The Wizard ( 1896 ) , Elissa : The Doom of Zimbabwe ( 1899 ) , and Black Heart and White Heart : A Zulu Idyll ( 1900 ) . 
 Burnham 's youngest son , Bruce B. Burnham ( 1897 – October 3 , 1905 ) , was staying with his parents in London when he accidentally drowned in the River Thames . His brother , Roderick , was in California the night Bruce died , yet claimed to know from a dream exactly what had happened . Roderick awoke screaming and rushed to tell his grandmother about his nightmare . The next morning , a cable arrived with the news of Bruce 's death . 
 His brother Howard Burnham ( 1870 – 1918 ) , born shortly before the family moved to Los Angeles , lost one leg at the age of 14 and suffered from tuberculosis . During his teenage years he lived with Fred in California and learned from his brother the art of Scoutcraft , how to shoot , and how to ride the range , all in spite of his wooden leg . Howard moved to Africa , became a mining engineer in the Johannesburg gold mines , and later wrote a text book on Modern Mine Valuation . He traveled the world and for a time teamed up with Fred on Yaqui River irrigation project in Mexico . During World War I , Howard worked as a spy for the French government , operating behind enemy lines in southwest Germany . Throughout the war he used his wooden leg to conceal tools he needed for spying . From his death bed , Howard returned to France via Switzerland and shared his vital data and secrets with the French government : the Germans were not opening a new front in the Alps and there was no need to move allied troops away from the Western Front . Howard was buried at Cannes , France , leaving behind his wife and four children . He had been named after his second cousin , Lieutenant Howard Mather Burnham who was killed in action in the American Civil War . 
 Burnham 's first cousin Charles Edward Russell ( 1860 – 1941 ) was a journalist and politician and also a founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) . The author of a number of books of biography and social commentary Russell won a Pulitzer Prize in 1928 for his biography : The American Orchestra and Theodore Thomas . 
 In 1943 , at 83 years of age , Burnham married his much younger typist , Ilo K. Willits Burnham ( June 20 , 1894 – August 28 , 1982 ) . The couple sold their mansion and moved to Santa Barbara in 1946 . 
 Burnham was a descendant of Thomas Burnham ( 1617 – 1688 ) of Hartford , Connecticut , the first American ancestor of a large number of Burnhams . The descendants of Thomas Burnham have been noted in every American war , including the French and Indian War .

 In 1899 , Frank E. Fillis brought his circus and stage show " Savage South Africa " , featuring a number of Zulu performers , to the Empress Theatre at Earls Court in London as part of the " Greater Britain Exhibition . " The actors dramatically played out famous battles from the Matabele wars twice a day . The program featured " Wilson 's Heroic Stand at the Shangani River " , a re @-@ enactment of the battle of the Shangani Patrol . Fillis himself played Major Wilson , Peter Lobengula played the Matabele King Lobengula , and Burnham was played by the adopted son of Texas Jack <unk> , " Texas Jack " Jr . , who later ran a Wild West show in South Africa featuring the American cowboy and entertainer Will Rogers . The Shangani segment of the show was filmed in September 1899 , and subsequently sold to movie houses around the world as Major Wilson 's Last Stand . Years later , a feature length Shangani Patrol ( film ) ( 1970 ) was released . The picture was shot on location in and around Bulawayo by RPM Film Studios and directed by David Millin . Burnham was portrayed by the American cowboy actor Will Hutchins of the ABC / Warner Brothers western series Sugarfoot , and the part of Major Wilson was played by the South African actor Brian O 'Shaughnessy . 
 In late 1958 , Ernest Hemingway acquired the rights to produce a film version of Burnham 's memoirs , Scouting on Two Continents . CBS immediately contracted Hemingway to produce the film for television , with Gary Cooper expressing considerable interest in playing the part of Burnham . Hemingway was already behind schedule with other commitments , however , and no work had been done on the movie when he committed suicide in July 1961 . 
 Another epic film , On My Honor , was conceived and begun by Cecil B. DeMille . It was to document the founding of the Scouting movement but was left unfinished after DeMille died in January 1959 . The screenplay , by Jesse Lasky , Jr . , focused on Baden @-@ Powell , Burnham and other pioneers who were to have a major influence on Scouting . After DeMille 's death , associate producer Henry <unk> continued to work on the film until 1962 , hiring Sydney Box to assist with the script . Starting in 2001 , producers Jerry Molen and Robert Starling began work to finish DeMille 's project , using an updated screenplay by Starling based on the earlier work of Lasky and Box . 
 In June 2014 , <unk> Entertainment and Class 5 Films acquired the non @-@ fiction article American Hippopotamus , by Jon Mooallem , about the meat shortage in the U.S. in 1910 and the attempts made by Burnham , Duquesne and Congressman Robert Broussard to import hippopotamuses into the Louisiana bayous and to convince Americans to eat them . The movie will highlight the Burnham - Duquesne rivalry . Edward Norton , William <unk> and Brett Ratner will produce this feature film .

 Sir H. Rider Haggard , inventor of the lost world literary genre , was heavily influenced by the larger than life adventures of his friend Burnham as he penned his fictional hero Allan Quatermain . There are many similarities between these two African explorers : both sought and discovered ancient treasures and civilizations , both battled large wild animals and native peoples , both were renowned for their ability to track , even at night , and both had similar nicknames : Quatermain was dubbed " Watcher @-@ by @-@ Night " , while Burnham was called " He @-@ who @-@ sees @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark " . 
 To commemorate 100 years of Scouting , the BSA issued 100 bronze coins in 2007 featuring Burnham and Baden @-@ Powell . One side shows the bust of Burnham and is inscribed : " Major Frederick Russell Burnham " , " Father of Scouting " . Other side shows the bust of Baden @-@ Powell and is inscribed : " Col. Robert Baden @-@ Powell " , " Founder of Scouting " . The coins were distributed by the White Eagle District . Years earlier , the BSA helped create the Major Burnham Bowling Trophy , an annual bowling event sponsored by Union Oil and held in California . <unk> <unk> , an extinct <unk> ( Shovel @-@ <unk> elephant ) from California , was named after Burnham . It was discovered by John C. Blick , the brother of Burnham 's first wife . 
 = Rock martin = 
 The rock martin ( Ptyonoprogne fuligula ) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family that is resident in central and southern Africa . It breeds mainly in the mountains , but also at lower altitudes , especially in rocky areas and around towns , and , unlike most swallows , it is often found far from water . It is 12 – 15 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) long , with mainly brown plumage , paler @-@ toned on the upper breast and underwing coverts , and with white " windows " on the spread tail in flight . The sexes are similar in appearance , but juveniles have pale fringes to the upperparts and flight feathers . The former northern subspecies are smaller , paler , and whiter @-@ throated than southern African forms , and are now usually split as a separate species , the pale crag martin . The rock martin hunts along cliff faces for flying insects using a slow flight with much gliding . Its call is a soft twitter . 
 This martin builds a deep bowl nest on a sheltered horizontal surface , or a neat quarter @-@ sphere against a vertical rock face or wall . The nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers , and may be built on natural sites under cliff overhangs or on man @-@ made structures such as buildings , dam walls , culverts and bridges . It is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years . This species is a solitary breeder , and is not gregarious , but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations . The two or three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and grey blotches , and are incubated by both adults for 16 – 19 days prior to hatching . Both parents then feed the chicks . Fledging takes another 22 – 24 days , but the young birds will return to the nest to roost for a few days after the first flight . 
 This small martin is caught in flight by several fast , agile falcon species , such as hobbies , and it sometimes carries parasites , but it faces no major threats . Because of its range of nearly 10 million km2 ( 4 million sq mi ) and large , apparently stable , population , it is not seen as vulnerable and is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The rock martin was formally described in 1842 as Hirundo fuligula by German physician , explorer and zoologist Martin Lichtenstein and was moved to the new genus Ptyonoprogne by German ornithologist Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach in 1850 . Its nearest relatives are the three other members of the genus , the pale crag martin , P. obsoleta of north Africa , the dusky crag martin P. concolor of southern Asia and the Eurasian crag martin P. rupestris . The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek ptuon ( φτυον ) , " a fan " , referring to the shape of the opened tail , and Procne ( Πρόκνη ) , a mythological girl who was turned into a swallow . The specific name fuligula means " sooty @-@ throated " , from Latin <unk> " soot " and gula " throat " . 
 The three Ptyonoprogne species are members of the swallow family of birds , and are placed in the Hirundininae subfamily , which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins . DNA sequence studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae , broadly correlating with the type of nest built . The groups are the " core martins " including burrowing species like the sand martin , the " nest @-@ adopters " , which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities , and the " mud nest builders " . The Ptyonoprogne species construct open mud nests and therefore belong to the last group . Hirundo species also build open nests , Delichon house martins have a closed nest , and the Cecropis and Petrochelidon swallows have retort @-@ like closed nests with an entrance tunnel . 
 The genus Ptyonoprogne is closely related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo , but a DNA analysis showed that a coherent enlarged Hirundo genus should contain all the mud @-@ builder genera . Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow , the DNA research suggested that if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus , as is normally the case , Cecropis , Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 There are several subspecies differing in plumage shade or size , although the differences are clinal , and races interbreed where their ranges meet . The small , pale former subspecies ( obsoleta , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , arabica and <unk> ) found in the mountains of North Africa , the Arabian peninsula and southwest Asia are now normally split as a separate species , the pale crag martin , following German ornithologist Jean Cabanis , who first formally described these birds , but the changes in size and colour are continuous , and the forms often intergrade where they meet , so the evidence for separate species is not strong . The southern forms of the rock martin can weigh more than twice as much as the smallest northern subspecies of pale crag martin . The average weight for P. f. fusciventris is 22 @.@ 4 g ( 0 @.@ 79 oz ) against 10 g ( 0 @.@ 35 oz ) for P. o. obsoleta . The robust , large @-@ billed southernmost forms ( P. f. fuligula , P. f. <unk> , and P. f. anderssoni ) are sufficiently different from dark , fine @-@ billed P. f. fusciventris that the latter could also be regarded as a potentially different species . However , Rhodesian ornithologist Michael Irwin collected specimens from southern Zimbabwe ( then Rhodesia ) which were dark above like P. f. fusciventris and rich reddish below like P. f. fuligula . This led him to suggest that the two groups had previously been isolated , but were probably hybridising following secondary contact . 
 = = Description = = 
 The rock martin of the nominate subspecies P. f. fuligula is 12 – 15 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) long with earth @-@ brown upperparts and a short square tail that has small white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers . It has a cinnamon chin , throat , upper breast and underwing coverts , with the rest of the underparts being a similar brown to the upperparts . The eyes are brown , the small bill is mainly black , and the legs are brownish @-@ pink . The sexes are similar in appearance , but juveniles have pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers . The other subspecies differ from the nominate form as detailed above . 
 The rock martin 's flight is slow , with rapid wing beats interspersed with flat @-@ winged glides , and it is more acrobatic than the larger Eurasian crag martin . It is a quiet bird ; the song is a muffled twitter , and other calls include a trrt resembling the call of the common house martin , a nasal <unk> , and a high pitched twee contact call . 
 The rock martin is much drabber than most African swallows , and confusion is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins of the genus Riparia . The pale crag martin is smaller , paler and greyer than its southern relative . Although only slightly larger than the sand martin and brown @-@ throated sand martin , the rock martin is more robust , has white tail spots , and lacks a breast band . It is paler on the throat , breast and underwings than the all @-@ dark form of the brown @-@ throated sand martin . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The rock martin breeds in suitable habitat in Africa north to Nigeria , Chad and Ethiopia . It is largely resident apart from local movements or a descent to lower altitudes after breeding . This species has been recorded as a vagrant in Gabon , and its status in Congo is uncertain . 
 The natural breeding habitat is hilly or mountainous country with cliffs , gorges and caves up to 3 @,@ 700 m ( 12 @,@ 000 ft ) above sea level , but this martin also breeds in lowlands , especially if rocks or buildings are available , and may be found far from water . It readily uses man @-@ made structures as a substitute for natural precipices . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Rock martin pairs often nest alone , although where suitable sites are available small loose colonies may form with up to 40 pairs . These martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against conspecifics and other species . Breeding dates vary geographically and with local weather conditions . Two broods are common , and three have been raised in a season . Breeding mainly August to September . The nest , built by both adults over several weeks , is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry grass or sometimes feathers . It may be a half @-@ cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff , or bowl @-@ shaped like that of the barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge . The nest may be built on a rock cliff face , in a crevice or on a man @-@ made structure , and is re @-@ used for the second brood and in subsequent years . 
 The clutch is usually two or three buff @-@ white eggs blotched with sepia or grey @-@ brown particularly at the wide end . The average egg size in South Africa was 20 @.@ 8 x 14 @.@ 1 mm ( 0 @.@ 82 x 0 @.@ 56 in ) with a weight of 2 @.@ 17 g ( 0 @.@ 077 oz ) . Both adults incubate the eggs for 16 – 19 days prior to hatching and feed the chicks about ten times an hour until they fledge and for several days after they can fly . The fledging time can vary from 22 – 24 days to 25 – 30 days , though the latter estimates probably take into account fledged young returning to the nest for food . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The rock martin feeds mainly on insects caught in flight , although it will occasionally feed on the ground . When breeding , birds often fly back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills and feed close to the nesting territory . At other times , they may hunt low over open ground . The insects caught depend on what is locally available , but may include mosquitoes and other flies , Hymenoptera , ants and beetles . This martin often feeds alone , but sizeable groups may gather at grass fires to feast on the fleeing insects , and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300 may form where food is abundant . Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas . Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt , relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns . 
 A study of nine bird species including four hirundines showed that the more young there are in a nest , the more frequent are the parents ' feeding visits , but the visits do not increase in proportion to the number of young . On average a solitary nestling therefore gets more food than a member of a pair or of a trio . Since the nestling period is not prolonged in proportion to the drop in feeding rate , an individual fledgling from a larger brood is likely to weigh less when it leaves the nest . However , a subspecies of the rock martin ( P. f. fusciventris ) was an anomaly in respect of both feeding rate and nestling time . There was no difference in parental feeding rate for members of a pair and members of a trio , but the nestling period averaged 1 @.@ 5 days longer for trios than pairs . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 Some falcons have the speed and agility to catch swallows and martins in flight , and rock martins may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon , Taita falcon , African hobby and wintering Eurasian hobby . Rock martins often share their nesting sites with little swifts , which sometimes forcibly take over the martin 's nests . In 1975 , one of the first findings of the tick Argas ( A. ) africolumbae was in a nest of Ptyonoprogne f. fusciventris in Kenya , at that time the martin was described under its synonym Ptyonoprogne fuligula <unk> ( Fischer & Reichenow ) . 
 = = Status = = 
 The rock martin has a very large range of 9 @.@ 5 million km2 ( 3 @.@ 7 million sq mi ) . The total population is unknown , but the bird is described as generally common , although scarce in Botswana and Namibia . The population is thought to be stable , mainly due to the absence of evidence of any declines or substantial threats . Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the rock martin is not considered to be threatened , and it is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List .
