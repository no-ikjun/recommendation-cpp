 The design of the three @-@ cent nickel piece remained stable throughout its run , and there are few varieties . An overdate is known , 1887 / 6 . The die that struck those coins was originally dated 1886 , when no circulation strikes were made . So the die would not be wasted , the Mint altered the last digit from a 6 to a 7 ; evidence of both numbers is visible . Some 1865 pieces in proof condition display a wreath on the reverse that comes much closer to touching the rim than on later issues . These were most likely pattern coins but they are accepted as issued because the Mint placed them in some 1865 proof sets . Many of the three @-@ cent nickel pieces were not fully struck , and are missing details of the design ; this is because the head of Liberty is directly opposite the III , and the Mint had trouble getting the hard metal alloy to adequately flow to the high points of both sides . 
 = Chicxulub crater = 
 The Chicxulub crater ( pronunciation : / <unk> / ; Mayan : [ <unk> ] ) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico . Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub , after which the crater is named . The date of the Chicxulub impactor , which created it , coincides precisely with the Cretaceous – Paleogene boundary ( K – Pg boundary ) , around 66 million years ago . The crater is more than 180 kilometers ( 110 miles ) in diameter and 20 km ( 12 mi ) in depth , well into the continental crust of the region of about 10 – 30 km depth . It makes the feature the third of the largest confirmed impact structures on Earth ; the impacting bolide that formed the crater was at least 10 km ( 6 mi ) in diameter . 
 The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield , geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s . Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search . Later , through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990 , Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature . Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz , a gravity anomaly , and tektites in surrounding areas . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 In 1978 , geophysicists Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield were working for the Mexican state @-@ owned oil company Petróleos Mexicanos , or Pemex , as part of an airborne magnetic survey of the Gulf of Mexico north of the Yucatán peninsula . Penfield 's job was to use geophysical data to scout possible locations for oil drilling . In the data , Penfield found a huge underwater arc with " extraordinary symmetry " in a ring 70 km ( 40 mi ) across . He then obtained a gravity map of the Yucatán made in the 1960s . A decade earlier , the same map suggested an impact feature to contractor Robert <unk> , but he was forbidden to publicize his conclusion by Pemex corporate policy of the time . Penfield found another arc on the peninsula itself , the ends of which pointed northward . Comparing the two maps , he found the separate arcs formed a circle , 180 km ( 110 mi ) wide , centered near the Yucatán village Chicxulub ; he felt certain the shape had been created by a cataclysmic event in geologic history . 
 Pemex disallowed release of specific data but let Penfield and company official Antonio Camargo present their results at the 1981 Society of Exploration <unk> conference . That year 's conference was <unk> and their report attracted scant attention . Coincidentally , many experts in impact craters and the K – Pg boundary were attending a separate conference on Earth impacts . Although Penfield had plenty of geophysical data sets , he had no rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact . 
 He knew Pemex had drilled exploratory wells in the region . In 1951 , one bored into what was described as a thick layer of andesite about 1 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 4 @,@ 300 ft ) down . This layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an Earth impact , but at the time of the borings it was dismissed as a lava dome — a feature uncharacteristic of the region 's geology . Penfield tried to secure site samples , but was told such samples had been lost or destroyed . When attempts at returning to the drill sites and looking for rocks proved fruitless , Penfield abandoned his search , published his findings and returned to his Pemex work . 
 At the same time , in 1980 , geologist Walter Alvarez and his father , Nobel Prize @-@ winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez , put forth his hypothesis that a large extraterrestrial body had struck Earth . In 1981 , unaware of Penfield 's discovery , University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth @-@ impact theory and sought a candidate crater . Their evidence included greenish @-@ brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites . Thick , jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present , thought to have been scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a kilometers @-@ high tsunami resulting from an Earth impact . Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the Caribbean basin at the K – Pg boundary . So when Haitian professor Florentine <unk> discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti , Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact . Tests on samples retrieved from the K – Pg boundary revealed more <unk> glass , formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high @-@ yield nuclear detonations . 
 In 1990 , Houston Chronicle reporter Carlos <unk> told Hildebrand of Penfield 's earlier discovery of a possible impact crater . Hildebrand contacted Penfield in April 1990 and the pair soon secured two drill samples from the Pemex wells , stored in New Orleans . Hildebrand 's team tested the samples , which clearly showed shock @-@ metamorphic materials . 
 A team of California researchers including Kevin Pope , Adriana Ocampo , and Charles <unk> , surveying regional satellite images in 1996 , found a <unk> ( sinkhole ) ring centered on Chicxulub that matched the one Penfield saw earlier ; the sinkholes were thought to be caused by subsidence of the impact crater wall . More recent evidence suggests the actual crater is 300 km ( 190 mi ) wide , and the 180 km ring is in fact an inner wall of it . 
 = = Impact specifics = = 
 Researchers at the University of Glasgow dated tektites samples from the impact as 66 @,@ 038 @,@ 000 ± 11 @,@ 000 years old . 
 The Chicxulub impactor had an estimated diameter of 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) or larger , and delivered an estimated energy of 420 <unk> ( over a billion times the energy of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ) . By contrast , the most powerful man @-@ made explosive device ever detonated , the Tsar Bomba , had an energy of only 210 petajoules ( the yield of 50 megatons of TNT ) , making the Chicxulub impact roughly 2 million times more powerful . Even the most energetic known volcanic eruption , which released an estimated energy of 1 <unk> ( the equivalent of approximately 240 gigatons of TNT ) and created the La <unk> Caldera , delivered only 0 @.@ 1 % of the energy of the Chicxulub impact . The impact is estimated to have displaced almost 200 @,@ 000 cubic kilometers ( 48 @,@ 000 cubic miles ) of sediment , two orders of magnitude more than the amount displaced by the second @-@ largest instantaneous deposit , the <unk> debris flow in Hawaii . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 The impact would have caused some of the largest megatsunamis in Earth 's history that would have reached all the way to Texas and Florida . A cloud of super @-@ heated dust , ash and steam would have spread from the crater as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second . Excavated material along with pieces of the impactor , ejected out of the atmosphere by the blast , would have been heated to incandescence upon re @-@ entry , broiling the Earth 's surface and possibly igniting wildfires ; meanwhile , colossal shock waves would have triggered global earthquakes and volcanic eruptions . 
 The emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years , possibly a decade , creating a harsh environment for living things . The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would have led to a sudden greenhouse effect . Over a longer period , sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere , cooling the surface dramatically . Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted , affecting the entire food chain . A model of the event developed by Lomax et al . ( 2001 ) suggests that net primary productivity ( NPP ) rates may have increased to higher than pre @-@ impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations . 
 In February 2008 , a team of researchers led by Sean Gulick at the University of Texas at Austin 's Jackson School of Geosciences used seismic images of the crater to determine that the impactor landed in deeper water than was previously assumed . They argued that this would have resulted in increased sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere . According to the press release , that " could have made the impact deadlier in two ways : by altering climate ( sulfate aerosols in the upper atmosphere can have a cooling effect ) and by generating acid rain ( water vapor can help to flush the lower atmosphere of sulfate aerosols , causing acid rain ) . " 
 A long @-@ term local effect of the impact was the creation of the Yucatán sedimentary basin which " ultimately produced favorable conditions for human settlement in a region where surface water is scarce . " 
 = = = Geology and morphology = = = 
 In their 1991 paper , Hildebrand , Penfield , and company described the geology and composition of the impact feature . The rocks above the impact feature are layers of marl and limestone reaching to a depth of almost 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) . These rocks date back as far as the Paleocene . Below these layers lie more than 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) of andesite glass and breccia . These andesitic igneous rocks were only found within the supposed impact feature , as is shocked quartz . The K – Pg boundary inside the feature is depressed to 600 to 1 @,@ 100 m ( 2 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 600 ft ) compared with the normal depth of about 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) measured 5 km ( 3 mi ) away from the impact feature . Along the edge of the crater are clusters of <unk> or sinkholes , which suggest that there was a water basin inside the feature during the Neogene period , after the impact . The groundwater of such a basin would have dissolved the limestone and created the caves and <unk> beneath the surface . The paper also noted that the crater seemed to be a good candidate source for the tektites reported at Haiti . 
 = = = Astronomical origin of asteroid = = = 
 In September 2007 , a report published in Nature proposed an origin for the asteroid that created the Chicxulub Crater . The authors , William F. <unk> , David <unk> , and David <unk> , argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the Baptistina family of asteroids , the largest surviving member of which is 298 Baptistina . They proposed that the " Chicxulub asteroid " was also a member of this group . The connection between Chicxulub and Baptistina is supported by the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments of the impactor , suggesting the impactor was a member of a rare class of asteroids called carbonaceous chondrites , like Baptistina . According to <unk> , the Chicxulub impactor was a fragment of a much larger parent body about 170 km ( 106 mi ) across , with the other impacting body being around 60 km ( 37 mi ) in diameter . In 2011 , new data from the Wide @-@ field Infrared Survey Explorer revised the date of the collision which created the Baptistina family to about 80 million years ago . This makes an asteroid from this family highly improbable to be the asteroid that created the Chicxulub Crater , as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years . In 2010 , another hypothesis was offered which implicated the newly discovered asteroid P / 2010 A2 , a member of the Flora family of asteroids , as a possible remnant cohort of the K / Pg impactor . 
 = = = Chicxulub and mass extinction = = = 
 The Chicxulub Crater lends support to the theory postulated by the late physicist Luis Alvarez and his son , geologist Walter Alvarez , that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups , including non @-@ avian dinosaurs , may have resulted from a bolide impact ( the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event ) . Luis and Walter Alvarez , at the time both faculty members at the University of California , Berkeley , postulated that this enormous extinction event , which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the Chicxulub crater , could have been caused by just such a large impact . The age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago , the end of the Cretaceous period , and the start of the Paleogene period . It coincides with the K – Pg boundary , the geological boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene . The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event , including the worldwide extinction of non @-@ avian dinosaurs . This conclusion has been the source of controversy . In March 2010 , 41 experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence : 20 years ' worth of data spanning a variety of fields . They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions at the K – Pg boundary . In 2013 a study compared isotopes in impact glass from the Chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the extinction event occurred in the fossil record ; the study concluded that the impact glasses were dated at 66 @.@ 038 ± 0 @.@ 049 Ma , and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66 @.@ 019 ± 0 @.@ 021 Ma , the two dates being within 19 @,@ 000 years of each other , or almost exactly the same within experimental error . The theory is now widely accepted by the scientific community . Some critics , including paleontologist Robert Bakker , argue that such an impact would have killed frogs as well as dinosaurs , yet the frogs survived the extinction event . Gerta Keller of Princeton University argues that recent core samples from Chicxulub prove the impact occurred about 300 @,@ 000 years before the mass extinction , and thus could not have been the causal factor . However , this conclusion is unsupported by radioactive dating and <unk> . 
 The main evidence of such an impact , besides the crater itself , is contained in a thin layer of clay present in the K – Pg boundary across the world . In the late 1970s , the <unk> and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of iridium . Iridium levels in this layer reached 6 parts per billion by weight or more compared to 0 @.@ 4 for the Earth 's crust as a whole ; in comparison , meteorites can contain around 470 parts per billion of this element . It was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the Earth 's surface amongst other material thrown up by the impact , producing the layer of iridium @-@ enriched clay . Similarly , an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the <unk> impact of about 2 @.@ 5 million years ago . 
 = = Multiple impact hypothesis = = 
 In recent years , several other craters of around the same age as Chicxulub have been discovered , all between latitudes 20 ° N and 70 ° N. Examples include the disputed <unk> crater in the North Sea and the <unk> crater in Ukraine . Both are much smaller than Chicxulub , but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across striking the Earth . This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time . Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger Shiva crater , though the structure 's status as a crater is contested . 
 The collision of Comet Shoemaker – Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet , giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet should collide with a planet . Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants , and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past . This scenario may have occurred on Earth at the end of the Cretaceous , though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300 @,@ 000 years apart . 
 In late 2006 , Ken MacLeod , a geology professor from the University of Missouri , completed an analysis of sediment below the ocean 's surface , bolstering the single @-@ impact theory . MacLeod conducted his analysis approximately 4 @,@ 500 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 800 mi ) from the Chicxulub Crater to control for possible changes in soil composition at the impact site , while still close enough to be affected by the impact . The analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment , which indicated there was only one impact . Multiple @-@ impact proponents such as Gerta Keller regard the results as " rather hyper @-@ inflated " and do not agree with the conclusion of MacLeod 's analysis , arguing that there might only be gaps of hours to days between impacts in a multiple @-@ impact scenario ( cf . Shoemaker @-@ Levy 9 ) which would not leave a detectable gap in deposits .

 During April and May 2016 , a joint <unk> @-@ <unk> Mission Specific Platform Expedition obtained the first offshore core samples from the peak ring , the central zone of the crater . During Expedition 364 , DES drillers on the L / B Myrtle collected core for <unk> Science Party members to study how the peak ring formed and what was the total impact energy . 
 Their target depth was 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) below the bottom of the ocean , but reached to an acceptable 1 @,@ 300 m . The main study will be done after the cores have been shipped to Bremen , Germany .

 " Don 't Forget About Us " is a song by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey . It was written by Carey , Jermaine Dupri , Bryan @-@ Michael Cox and Johntá Austin , and released as the fifth single on December 12 , 2005 , for the re @-@ issue of her tenth studio album , The Emancipation of Mimi ( 2005 ) . Co @-@ produced by the former three , the song is influenced by R & B and hip hop soul music genres , and lyrically chronicles the emotions felt by the protagonist after the loss of their relationship . Carey explained that the true meaning of the song is to be interpreted by the listener , therefore not disclosing its entire meaning publicly . 
 The song received generally positive reviews from music critics , with many heavily comparing it to Carey 's previous single " We Belong Together " . Several reviewers felt the song 's similarity marked Carey 's lack of creativity with it , while others embraced its radio @-@ friendly formula . " Don 't Forget About Us " became Carey 's seventeenth chart topping single on the US Billboard Hot 100 , tying the record for most number @-@ one singles by a solo artist set by Elvis Presley 36 years before . Internationally , the song topped the singles chart in Belgium and Finland , and reached the top @-@ ten in Hungary and the Netherlands . 
 Carey performed the song at the 33rd annual American Music Awards , and during the half @-@ time of the Thanksgiving game between the Detroit Lions and the Atlanta Falcons . Additionally , the song was included on the set @-@ lists of Carey 's The Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tours . The song 's music video chronicles the two time frames , Carey in the present , as well as the past memories she shared with her ex @-@ lover that continue to haunt her . At the 49th annual Grammy Awards , " Don 't Forget About Us " was nominated for two awards during the ceremony held on February 11 , 2007 .

 After being branded Carey 's " comeback album " by music critics , and becoming the highest selling album of her career post @-@ Glitter ( 2001 ) , The Emancipation of Mimi inspired Carey to return to the studio , in hopes of writing and producing new material for her next studio album . During a writing session with Jermaine Dupri , Carey wrote " Don 't Forget About Us " as a possible single for her next album , reminiscent of the material on The Emancipation of Mimi . After hearing the unfinished version of the song , L.A. Reid , CEO at the time of Carey 's label Island Records , was very satisfied with the song . He convinced Carey to continue writing and producing new songs , and suggested on re @-@ releasing the album , which had already sold over four million units in the United States alone . Carey agreed to the idea of re @-@ releasing The Emancipation of Mimi , feeling eager to release the song , as well as other material to her fans , instead of making them wait for a brand new album . In an interview with MTV News , Carey discussed the decision of releasing the song immediately , as well as the re @-@ release of the album : 
 <unk> 't Forget About Us ' was a song that Jermaine [ Dupri ] and I started writing and didn 't finish , and L.A. Reid heard it . He was excited about it and he was like , ' We should re @-@ release the album . I agreed because were trying to figure out what to do with the song because we loved it so much , and we didn 't want to wait until the next album to send it to radio . 
 After completing the song , Carey announced on October 13 , 2005 via her official website , that she would be re @-@ releasing The Emancipation of Mimi . Additionally , she explained how the album would contain four new songs , and would be promoted internationally by the new single , " Don 't Forget About Us " . The song was released throughout the globe as the fifth official single from The Emancipation of Mimi , and the first from the re @-@ release , tentatively titled , Ultra Platinum Edition .

 " Don 't Forget About Us " is a mid @-@ tempo song lasting three minutes and fifty @-@ three seconds , while drawing influence from pop and R & B with downtempo beats music genres . Written by Carey , Jermaine Dupri , Bryan @-@ Michael Cox and Johntá Austin , and produced by the former three , the song drew comparisons to Carey 's " We Belong Together " . According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard , the song features a similar tempo , lyrical style , instrumentation and production as the latter song , and incorporates a reminiscent vocal performance from Carey . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing , the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 72 beats per minute . The song is composed in the key of G minor , with Carey 's vocal range spanning from the low @-@ note of D3 to the high @-@ note of F6 . Lyrically , the song describes the potency of a " first love " , and features a protagonist pleading to her lover to " not forget about them " . Critics noted that the song 's lyrics both let go of a lover , as well as cherishing their memory . Carey sings " Just let it die / With no goodbyes " , indicating a relationship that has long decayed , and how she has let it drift away , while also adding " here 's only one me and you / And how we used to shine / No matter what you go through / We are one , that 's a fact / That you can 't deny " , indicating that while they are no longer together , she will continue to cherish the memory of them , and how strong their love was . According to Carey , she refrained from giving away too much of the song 's lyrical meaning , in order to allow fans to possibly interpret the song in their own way : 
 I try not to get too specific so that people can apply the lyrics to their own lives . When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever , I would want to be able to completely connect it to that moment . And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different , it ruined it for me . So I kind of like to keep it open for people 's imaginations . It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time . " Don 't Forget About Us " could give you a good , happy memory , or you could be miserable , crying , listening to it over and over . All in all , I think it 's good to have music you can live vicariously through , and that 's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them .

 " Don 't Forget About Us " garnered generally positive reviews from music critics , though many compared it to , and felt it shared several similarities with Carey 's previous single , " We Belong Together " . Bill Lamb from About.com rated the song four out of five stars , who while noting the song 's careful formula , complimented Carey 's more mature and lower range vocals : " Mariah is clearly settling into a more mature style and lower range vocals than in her early career . " Additionally , Lamb commented that although not as " strong " as " We Belong Together " , the song was marginally better than another single from The Emancipation of Mimi , " Shake It Off " . Billboard 's Michael Paoletta drew heavy comparisons to " We Belong Together " , noting the song 's similar tempo , lyrical style , instrumentation and vocal stamp . He commented that although " Don 't Forget About Us " was " satisfying " on its own , it suggested that Carey had hit a creative wall . Andre Meyer from CBC News described the song as " stronger " than anything Carey released from 2001 – 2005 , and wrote " [ It ] cops the jittery R & B vibe that made Destiny ’ s Child so potent . " Reviewers from The New Yorker and Music Week were both taken aback by the single , calling it " beautiful " and " gentle " , respectively . Todd Martens from the Los Angeles Times compared it heavily to Carey 's 2008 single " Bye Bye " , describing their piano melody as " a close match " . In 2007 , " Don 't Forget About Us " was nominated for two Grammy Awards , in the " Best Female R & B Vocal Performance " and " Best R & B Song " categories , although not winning either .

Since its release , Carey claimed it to be one of her favorite videos , due to its complex scenery and fun nature . She explained that she had wanted to work with Hunter again for some time , and was happy to be able to film another music video alongside him . In an interview with MTV News , Carey described her feelings regarding the video , as well as sentiments towards the video 's director , Hunter : " But I was so happy to work with him again ' cause ever since ' Honey ' I 've been trying to relive the splendor of that moment . It 's more of just a plain beauty piece with sentimental overtones , but it was great to work with Paul again . " Following a tale of love and separation , the video alternates between two different time frames . The first of these involves a tearful Carey in the present , while the second invokes memories of a relationship with a former lover ( played by Dolce & Gabbana model Christian <unk> ) . When questioned regarding a possible relationship with <unk> , Carey said " Erm , how do we play this ?

The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse , laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home . As the song begins , she stands up and walks around the living room , while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship . As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown , she is once again shown in the present , however clothed in a large white sweater while tears trickle down her cheek . As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field , they are seen together , caressing each other and holding each other in a tight embrace . Carey , in the present , makes her way into a heated pool , where she lays her leg on the deck , re @-@ enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe 's unreleased film , Something 's Got to Give ( 1962 ) .

 = Droungarios of the Watch = 
 The Droungarios of the Watch ( Greek : δρουγγάριος τῆς <unk> / <unk> , droungarios tēs <unk> / <unk> ) , sometimes anglicized as " Drungary of the Watch " , was originally a senior Byzantine military post . Attested since the late 8th century , the droungarios commanded the Vigla or " Watch " , one of the elite professional cavalry regiments ( tagmata ) of the middle Byzantine period , and was in charge of the Byzantine emperor 's personal security . From ca . 1030 , the office was disassociated from its military origin and was transformed into a senior judicial position , thereafter usually referred to as the Grand Droungarios of the Watch ( μέγας δρουγγάριος τῆς <unk> / <unk> , megas droungarios tēs <unk> / <unk> ) . The office continued to exist as a mostly honorific court dignity in the Palaiologan era , until the very end of the Byzantine Empire in the mid @-@ 15th century . 
 = = Military office = = 
 The Droungarios of the Watch was originally the commander of the Vigla ( " guard watch " ) or <unk> ( " number " ) , the third of the tagmata , professional cavalry regiments headquartered in and around Constantinople , and distinct from the provincial or thematic troops . The title of droungarios itself means " commander of a <unk> " , a term of Gaulish origin which came to be used as a term for a kind of tactical cavalry formation in the East Roman army of Late Antiquity . The term droungarios ( Greek : δρουγγάριος ) is not documented before the early 7th century but might have been used as an informal or unofficial designation before that date . The office and the corresponding unit appear to have initially referred to ad hoc arrangements , but during the early 7th century these were formalized , like much of the East Roman army 's rank structure . 
 Judging from the unit 's name and the peculiar titles of its officers , it also had a considerable ancestry , dating back to the East Roman army , but it is unknown exactly when it was constituted as a tagma . The office of the Droungarios of the Watch at any rate is first attested ca . 791 , when Alexios Mosele is recorded as " spatharios and droungarios of the Watch " . In contrast to the other tagmata , the Watch and its commanders had special duties related to the safety of the Emperor and the imperial palace . Within Constantinople , the Watch provided guards for the palace precinct , and kept a permanent garrison at the Covered Hippodrome ( also the droungarios 's seat 
 As detailed in the De Ceremoniis , the Droungarios of the Watch always accompanied the Emperor and was a frequent participant in various imperial ceremonies , often accompanied by his principal aide , the akolouthos . His ceremonial dress is indicated as the <unk> tunic and a red <unk> cloak , while on some occasions he bore a sword , a mace and an axe . The latter weapon was highly unusual for a Byzantine officer , and Guilland suggests that this was connected to his command of foreign troops via the akolouthos ( who later notably became the commander of the axe @-@ bearing Varangian Guard ) . In the 10th century , when several holders of the post were scions of the most prominent families of the military aristocracy , including Eustathios Argyros , John Kourkouas and Manuel Kourtikes , the droungarios occupied the 36th place in the imperial hierarchy and usually held the senior court dignities of anthypatos , patrikios or <unk> .

 = = Judicial office = = 
 In ca . 1030 , the office changed from military to purely judicial , and was further distinguished by acquiring the epithet " Grand " ( megas ) in the 1070s . It seems that the droungarios took over the Court of the Hippodrome , extant since the mid @-@ 9th century and so known after its location in the Covered Hippodrome ( or , according to an alternative interpretation , in the substructures of the main Hippodrome of Constantinople ) . This was followed by the creation of new courts and the restructuring of the Byzantine judicial system , so that in the Komnenian period ( 1081 – 1185 ) , the Court of the Hippodrome or " Court of the Droungarios " ( τὸ <unk> <unk> , to <unk> <unk> ) was one of the seven superior civil courts , alongside those of the Eparch of the City , the <unk> , the <unk> , the epi tōn <unk> , the <unk> and the katholikos , who headed the court for fiscal affairs ( <unk> <unk> ) . The droungarios also served as an appellate court for the decisions of the epi tōn <unk> . The holders of the post belonged to some of the most distinguished families of the civil aristocracy , including such men as Eustathios <unk> , John Skylitzes and Andronikos Kamateros .

 = = Palaiologan era = = 
 Following the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204 , the office 's continuity was broken , and when it reappears in the sources of the Palaiologan period , it had lost any judicial functions and resembled more its original military character : according to the mid @-@ 14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo @-@ Kodinos , the Grand Droungarios of the Watch was a subordinate of the Grand Domestic , charged with the night watch and with supervising the army 's scouts . In reality , however , it had become more of a sinecure and was essentially a court dignity devoid of any but ceremonial duties . 
 In Pseudo @-@ Kodinos ' work , the Grand Droungarios of the Watch ranks 24th in the imperial hierarchy , between the Eparch and the megas hetaireiarches . The Grand Droungarios 's distinctive court dress , as reported by Pseudo @-@ Kodinos , consisted of a gold @-@ brocaded hat ( <unk> ) , a plain silk kabbadion tunic and a staff ( <unk> ) with a gilded knob on top , and covered with golden @-@ red braid below . For ceremonies and festivities , he bore the domed skaranikon , of yellow and golden silk and decorated with gold wire embroidery , and with a portrait of the emperor seated on a throne in front and another with the emperor on horseback on the rear . 
 The dignity survived until the end of the Byzantine Empire . The historian Sphrantzes equated the Ottoman post of Agha of the Janissaries to the Grand Droungarios of the Watch .

 = Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad = 
 The Nawabs of Bengal ( full title , the Nawab Nizam of Bengal , Bihar and Orissa ) were the rulers of the then provinces of Bengal , Bihar and Orissa . Between 1717 and 1765 , they served as the rulers of the subah ( or province ) of Bengal . However , they were subordinate to the Mughal Empire . Siraj ud @-@ Daulah , the last independent Nawab of Bengal was betrayed in the Battle of Plassey by Mir Jafar . He lost to the British , who took over the charge of Bengal in 1757 , installed Mir Jafar on the <unk> ( throne ) and established itself to a political power in Bengal . 
 In 1765 the system of Dual Government was established , in which the Nawabs ruled on behalf of the British and were mere puppets to the British . In 1772 the system was abolished and Bengal was brought under direct control of the British . In 1793 , when the Nizamat ( governorship ) of the Nawab was also taken away from them , they remained as the mere pensioners of the British East India Company . The last Nawab of Bengal , Mansur Ali Khan abdicated on 1 November 1880 in favour of his eldest son . 
 Nawabs of Murshidabad succeeded the Nawabs of Bengal as Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad , following Mansur Ali Khan 's abdication They got the title changed as the title of the Nawab of Bengal was abolished in 1880 . They had little or no say in the share of the revenue collected and were ceased to use any force . After Indian Independence in 1947 it was declared that the princely states must accede to either India or Pakistan ( East / West Pakistan ) . It is a fact that Murshidabad ( the capital city ) became a part of East Pakistan ( now Bangladesh ) for two days , as it had a Muslim majority . The Pakistani flag was brought down from the <unk> Palace and the Indian tricolour was hoisted atop the palace . After merging with India , they had no power as the Government of India took over all the princely states in India . The house of the Nawabs came to end in 1969 with Waris Ali Mirza being the last Nawab . Although he left three sons and three daughters there has been no clear successor to the title since his death as he died without declaring one . 
 = = Bengal = = 
 The term " Bengal " incorporates to delineate the ethno @-@ linguistic region of Bengal which including but not limited is all districts within the People 's Republic of Bangladesh , as well as West Bengal , India . During the first partition of Bengal in the early 20th century a new province , Eastern Bengal was created as a Lieutenant @-@ Governorship along with Assam . In 1911 , East Bengal ( now Bangladesh ) was reunited with Bengal , and the new provinces in the east became : Assam , Bengal Province , Bihar and Orissa . The Nawab thus gained rule over Bihar and Orissa , which were earlier part of Bengal . So sometimes That is why the Nawabs of Bengal were also mentioned as " Nawab of Bengal , Bihar and Orissa " or " Nawab Nazim of Bengal , Bihar and Orissa " - where Nazim ( or , Subahdar ) means the provincial governor - as they ruled over three <unk> while the Nawabs of Murshidabad were the local ruler of the city of Murshidabad . The majority of modern Bengal is inhabited by Bengali people who speak the Bengali language .

 The early Sultans of Bengal ruled until 1282 which was followed by the rule of several successive dynasties . Ilyas Shah founder of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty , took complete charge of the then Bengal and the capital was shifted to Sonargaon ( near present day , Dhaka in Bangladesh ) . He was one of the independent rulers of Bengal . His son , Sikandar Shah , who succeeded him , built the Adina Mosque at <unk> , near Gour , Adina Mosque in the medieval times , was considered to be the largest in undivided Bengal , as well as the entire Indian subcontinent . 
 = = = Mughal Empire = = = 
 The Mughal Empire emerged as a powerful Empire in northern India . Babur , who was related to two legendary warriors – Timur and Genghis Khan , invaded north India and defeated Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty . Babur thus became the first Mughal emperor . He was succeeded by his son , Humayun . At the same time , Sher Shah Suri ( alias Farid Khan ) of the Suri dynasty rose to prominence and established himself as the ruler of the present day Bihar by defeating Ghiyasuddin Shah . But he lost to capture the kingdom because of sudden expedition of Humayun . In 1539 , Sher Khan faced Humayun in the battle of <unk> . He forced Humayun out of India . Assuming the title Sher Shah , he ascended the throne of Delhi . He also captured Agra and established control from Bengal in the east until the Indus River in the west . After his death he was succeeded by his son , Islam Shah Suri . But in 1544 the <unk> were torn apart by internal conflicts . Humayun took this advantage and captured Lahore and Delhi , but he died in 1556 AD . He was succeeded by Akbar , who defeated Daud Khan <unk> of Bengal 's <unk> Dynasty ( or , <unk> Dynasty ) . After this , the administration of the entire region of Bengal passed into the hands of governors appointed by the Mughal emperors , who ruled Bengal till 1716 AD . 
 There were several posts under the Mughal administrative system during Akbar 's reign . Diwani was a system of provincial revenue administration under the Mughals . Nizamat ( civil administration ) and Diwani ( revenue administration ) were the two main branches of the provincial administration under the Mughals . A Subahdar ( provincial viceroy or governor ) , also called a Nizam was in @-@ charge of the Nizamat . There was a chain of subordinate officials under the Nizams on the executive side and under <unk> on the revenue and judicial side . 
 = = = Emergence of the Nawab Nizam of Bengal = = = 
 Murshid Quli Khan arrived as the Diwan of Bengal in 1717 AD . Before his arrival , there were four <unk> . And , after his arrival , Azim @-@ ush @-@ Shan held the Nizam 's office . Azim got into conflict with Murshid Quli Khan over imperial financial control . Considering the complaint of Khan , the then Mughal emperor , Aurangzeb ordered Azim to move to Bihar . Upon his departure the two posts united in one and Murshid Quli Khan became the first Nizam cum Diwan of Bengal . Murshid Khan was appointed the " Nawab Nizam of Bengal " and he emerged as the ruler of Bengal under the Mughals . Murshidabad remained the capital of the Nawabs of Bengal until their rule . The Nawab Siraj ud @-@ Daulah , was betrayed in the Battle of Plassey by Mir Jaffer . He lost to the British East India Company , who took installed Mir Jaffer on the <unk> ( throne ) , as a " puppet ruler " and established itself to a political power in Bengal . 
 In 1765 , Robert Clive , of the British East India Company , became the first British Governor of Bengal . He secured in perpetuity for the Company the Diwani ( revenue and civil justice ) of the then Bengal subah from the then Mughal Emperor , Shah Alam II and thus the system of Dual Government was established and the Bengal Presidency was formed . In 1772 the Dual Government system was abolished and Bengal was brought under direct control of the British . In 1793 , when the Nizamat ( military power and criminal justice ) of the Nawab was also taken away from them , they remained as the mere pensioners of the British East India Company . After the Revolt of 1857 , Company rule in India ended and the British Crown took over the territories which were under the direct rule of the British East India Company in 1858 , which marked the beginning of the British Raj . These territories , including the territory of the Nawab <unk> came under the direct rule of the British Crown and British Raj was established in India . Thus , the Nawab Nizams remained just the titular heads of their territory , which was now ruled by the British Crown , and they had no political or any other kind of control over the territory . The last Nawab of Bengal , Mansoor Ali Khan abdicated on 1 November 1880 in favour of his eldest son .

 From 1717 until 1880 , three successive Islamic dynasties – Nasiri , Afshar and <unk> – ruled what was then known as Bengal . 
 The first dynasty , the Nasiri , ruled from 1717 until 1740 . The founder of the Nasiri , Murshid Quli Khan , was born a poor Deccani Odia Brahmin before being sold into slavery and bought by one Haji Shafi Isfahani , a Persian merchant from Isfahan who converted him to Islam . He entered the service of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and rose through the ranks before becoming the Nawab Nizam of Bengal in 1717 , a post he held until his death in 1727 . He in turn was succeeded by his son @-@ in @-@ law , Shuja @-@ ud @-@ Din Muhammad Khan . After Shuja @-@ ud @-@ Din 's death in 1739 he was succeeded by his son , Sarfaraz Khan , who held the rank , until he was killed in the Battle of <unk> in 1741 , and was succeeded by Alivardi Khan , former ruler of Patna , of the Afshar Dynasty in 1740 . 
 The second dynasty , the Afshar , ruled from 1740 to 1757 . Siraj ud @-@ Daulah ( Alivardi Khan 's grandson ) , the last Afshar Nawab was killed in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 . They were succeeded by the third and final dynasty to rule the whole Bengal , the <unk> . 
 = = = Under the Mughals = = = 
 Bengal Subah was one of the wealthiest parts of the Mughal empire . As the Mughal empire began to decline , the Nawabs grew in power , although nominally subordinate to the Mughal emperor . They wielded great power in their own right and finally became independent rulers of the Bengal region , for all practical purposes , by the early 1700s . 
 = = = Maratha expeditions = = = 
 Marathas undertook six expeditions in Bengal from 1741 – 1748 . Maratha general , Raghunath Rao was able to annex Orissa to his kingdom and the larger confederacy permanently as he successfully exploited the chaotic conditions prevailing in Bengal , Bihar and Orissa after the death of Murshid Quli Khan in 1727 . Constantly harassed by the <unk> , Orissa , Bengal and parts of Bihar were economically ruined . Alivardi Khan made peace with Raghunathrao in 1751 ceding in perpetuity Orissa up to the river <unk> , and agreeing to pay ₹ 12 lacs annually in lieu of the Chauth of Bengal and Bihar . 
 The treaty included ₹ 20 lacs as Chauth for Bengal ( includes both West Bengal and Bangladesh ) and ₹ 12 lacs for Bihar ( including Jharkhand ) . After this , Maratha promised never to cross the boundary of the Nawab of Bengal 's territory . 
 Thus , Baji Rao is hailed as the greatest Maratha chief after Shivaji because of his success in subjecting Muslim rulers of east India in states such as Bengal , Bihar and Orissa to the Maratha rule . 
 = = = Nawabs of Bengal under British rule and their decline = = = 
 The break @-@ up of the centralised Mughal empire by 1750 , led to the creation of numerous semi @-@ independent kingdoms ( all provinces of the former Mughal empire ) . Nawab Siraj ud @-@ Daulah was defeated by the British forces of Sir Robert Clive in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 . Thereafter the Nawab of Bengal became a " puppet ruler " depending on military support from British East India company to secure their throne . Siraj @-@ ud @-@ Daulah was replaced by Mir Jaffer . He was personally led to the throne by Robert Clive , after triumph of the British in the battle . He briefly tried to re @-@ assert his power by allying with the Dutch , but this plan was ended by the Battle of <unk> . After the defeat at Battle of Buxar and grant of the Diwani ( revenue collection ) of Bengal by the then Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II , to the British East India Company in August 1765 and the appointment of Warren Hastings by the East India Company as their first Governor General of Bengal in 1773 , the Nawabs authority became restricted . By 1773 , British East India company asserted much authority and formed the Bengal Presidency over areas ruled by the Nawabs i.e. the Bengal subah , along with some other regions and abolished the system of Dual Government . In 1793 ( during Nawab Mubarak ud @-@ Daulah 's reign ) , the Nizamat ( military power , civil and criminal justice ) was abolished , British East India company thus annexed this former Mughal province as part of their empire and took complete control of the region , and the Nawabs of Bengal became mere pensioners of the British East India Company . All the Diwan offices except the Diwan Ton were also abolished . 
 After the Revolt of 1857 , Company rule in India ended , and all the territories which were under the rule of the British East India Company came under the British Crown in 1858 , which marked the beginning of the British Raj . And administrative control of India came under the Indian Civil Service , which had administrative control over all areas in India , except the Princely States . 
 Mansoor Ali Khan ( aka <unk> Jah ) was the last Nawab of Bengal . During his reign the Nizamat at Murshidabad became involved in debts . The then Government of India involved it into an action of preventing further claims . <unk> Jah left Murshidabad in February 1869 and started living in England . The title of " Nawab of Bengal " was abolished in 1880 . He returned to Bombay in October 1880 but spent most of his time pleading his case against the orders of the Government of India . After it was not resolved the Nawab renounced his styles and titles of Nawab Nizam of Bengal , Bihar and Orissa and abdicated in favour of his eldest son at St. Ives , Maidenhead , on 1 November 1880 . 
 = = = Emergence of the Nawab of Murshidabad and the Nawabs post Indian independence = = = 
 The Nawabs of Murshidabad succeeded the Nawab Nizams of Bengal , Bihar and Orissa as Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad , following Mansoor Ali Khan 's abdication Nawabs of Murshidabad were the successors of the Nawabs of Bengal . After Lord Clive secured the Diwani of Bengal from Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II in 1765 for the East India Company they did not have any effective authority . So they lavishly enjoyed their title , privileges alongside with the honours they received . They got the title changed as the title of the Nawab of Bengal was abolished in 1880 . They had little or no say and ceased to control any significant force . 
 After Indian Independence in 1947 , all the non @-@ princely states were subject to a test of religious majority in which the Muslim majority areas formed the Dominion of Pakistan , while the other regions formed the Dominion of India . It is a fact that Murshidabad ( the capital city for both , the Nawabs of Bengal and the Nawabs of Murshidabad ) became a part of East Pakistan ( now Bangladesh ) for two days , as it had a Muslim majority . However , it became a part of India on 17 August 1947 . The Pakistani flag was brought down from the <unk> Palace and the Indian tricolour was hoisted atop the palace . The Nawabs , after the takeover by the British had no actual power and after merging with India too , they had yielded power , as the Government of India took over control of all the areas that merged with India . Furthermore , with the promulgation of the Indian Constitution on 26 January 1950 , the Dominion of India was transformed into the Republic of India , and the Article 18 of the Indian Constitution ( which is a part of the Right to Equality , a fundamental right in India ) , titles were abolished . The Article prevents the state from confirming any title except those titles given by the Government to those who have made their mark in military and academic fields . Such titles and awards include the Bharat Ratna , the Padma Shri and the Padma Vibhushan ( the Supreme Court of India , on 15 December 1995 , upheld the validity of such awards ) . Thus , with the promulgation of the Constitution , the title of the Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad was abolished . And although , the Nawab Waris Ali Meerza held titles such as Raes ud @-@ Daulah , they were not officially or legally recognised . 
 Although , the Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad had no political power the office continued to be held by the second Nawab Bahadur Syed Wasif Ali Meerza Khan Bahadur , who had held the office since 1906 , and after his death in 1959 , he was succeeded by his son , Syed Wasif Ali Meerza Khan Bahadur . Waris Ali Meerza died in 1969 , survived by his three sons and three daughters . According to the Nawab ’ s law , the eldest son of the Nawab succeeded him , however , Waris Ali 's eldest son , <unk> Ali Meerza Bahadur , was excluded from the succession by his father for contracting a non @-@ Muslim marriage and for not professing the Muslim religion . 
 Waris Ali Meerza , the third Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad , died in 1969 , and he took no steps during his lifetime to establish his succession . And before declaring his successor Waris Ali died . There was no clear successor to Waris Ali . 
 Since then there was no clear successor to Waris Ali and the titular office / post was in dispute , and a legal battle ensued . And following this as the title was in dispute , a legal battle ensued . Abbas Ali Meerza claimed to be the legal heir of Waris Ali on the basis of being the son of the daughter of Waris Alis ' father , the second Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad , Wasif Ali Meerza ; while Sajid Ali Meerza claimed the same on the basis of being the son by mut ‘ ah marriage of Wasif Ali . The case reached the Supreme Court and finally , the Supreme Court judges , Justice Ranjan <unk> and Justice R K Agrawal , gave their judgement on 13 August 2014 , declaring the then 72 @-@ year @-@ old Abbas Ali Meerza ( full name , Syed Mohammed Abbas Ali Meerza ) , who happened to be the son of the only daughter of Waris Ali ’ s father , Wasif Ali Meerza ( the third Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad ) , the successor and the legal heir to the former Nawab of Murshidabad , Waris Ali Meerza . The Court directed Abbas Ali Meerza , son of Syed Md . <unk> Ali Meerza , to be the direct descendant of Waris Ali Meerza . However , the case against the state 's annexation of the Murshidabad Estate , which is worth several thousand crores , is still on , as of 2014 . 
 However , as titles have been abolished in India , the title of the Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad no longer exists . However , Abbas Ali Meerza can now legally succeed Waris Ali Meerza 's office legally , but his title of the fourth Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad would be unofficial , as the title is not legally and officially recognised .

 Johnson spent much of his childhood in Baltimore . He played his sophomore and junior season of high school basketball at Moorhead Senior High School in Moorhead , Minnesota . Johnson transferred from Minnesota to Towson Catholic High School prior to his senior season . During the early signing period from November 13 through November 20 , 1991 , Johnson , who was considering several Ivy League schools as well as Northeastern University , verbally committed to Boston University .

The following week , he posted 21 points against Yale , which established his season @-@ high . Even after Allen and Maloney graduated , Princeton 's only two losses were to Penn . After Princeton and Penn ended the 1995 – 96 season tied as Ivy League Co @-@ Champions , Johnson made the decisive three point shot with one minute and four seconds remaining in overtime in the one @-@ game playoff , corralled a defensive rebound , added a pair of free throws with 24 seconds left and then made a steal . The win ended an eight @-@ game losing streak to Penn . The win earned the team the conference automatic bid to the 1996 NCAA Tournament and following the game head coach Pete Carril announced his retirement . The thirteen seeded team was matched against the defending national champion UCLA Bruins in its first round pairing . He was the team 's leading scorer with 11 points in the 43 – 41 first round victory over UCLA in the 1996 NCAA Tournament . The team fell behind 41 – 34 with over six minutes remaining . His 3 @-@ of @-@ 7 three point shooting performance included a shot to bring the team to within 4 . He also made the game @-@ tying layup to knot the score at 41 . He also defended Toby Bailey 's last second shot after Princeton took the lead with 3 @.@ 9 seconds remaining . During the game , UCLA jumped out to a 7 – 0 lead at the first TV timeout , and Johnson 's leadership held the team together early when UCLA looked strong . 
 As a senior , his new head coach , Bill Carmody described him as a shutdown defender . He was 1997 Ivy League Men 's basketball Player of the Year . Johnson earned the award for his defense and was the first winner with a single @-@ digit scoring average . He scored 15 on February 22 , when Princeton clinched the Ivy League regular season championship by defeating Dartmouth . The following week , he established Ivy League records for most consecutive three @-@ point field goals made , with 11 , and the most single @-@ game three @-@ point field goals made with no misses ( 6 for 6 ) against Columbia Lions men 's basketball on February 28 , 1997 and Cornell Big Red men 's basketball ( first 5 ) on March 1 , 1997 . He had twelve points in the regular season finale during which Princeton tied the school record with its nineteenth consecutive win . In the 1997 NCAA Tournament opening round matchup against the Cal Bears , when a final second pass was intercepted , he attempted to shoulder the blame with the press . He retired as the Princeton University all @-@ time leader in steals . His 169 total steals were fifth in Ivy League history at the end of his career and was eleventh at the end of the 2009 @-@ 10 NCAA Division I men 's basketball season . He retired second in Princeton history in career three point shots and fourth in career assists . 
 After writing his senior thesis on Kenyan education under British colonial rule and graduating with a bachelor 's degree in history , Johnson declined the postgraduate scholarship that he was awarded and played five years in Italy followed by two in Spain . Johnson played professional basketball in the Lega Basket Serie A and <unk> Basket in Italy and Liga Española de Baloncesto in Spain , one season each for Gorizia Pallacanestro A2 , Viola Reggio Calabria , Adecco Milano / <unk> Siena , <unk> Girona and Montepaschi Siena . He played two seasons with the Avellino in Italy from 2000 – 2002 . He had a seven @-@ year professional career before becoming a coach . In 1998 , he won an Italian Second Division championship as a starter for Gorizia Pallacanestro . In 1999 , he earned another league championship with for Reggio Calabria , and in his final professional season in 2004 he earned a league title with Siena . With Reggio Calabria , he teamed with Brent Scott , Brian Oliver , and Manu Ginobili to win a championship .

 Johnson was then brought on as an assistant to the newly appointed head coach at Georgetown , John Thompson III in 2004 . The team was coming off of a losing record and made it to a 2005 National Invitation Tournament . The team reached the Sweet Sixteen round of the 2006 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . During his tenure at Georgetown , he helped coach the team to an overall 72 – 30 record over 3 seasons and the 2006 – 07 team the 2007 Big East regular season championship , the 2007 Big East Men 's Basketball Tournament championship , and a trip to the Final Four of the 2007 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament .

 When Scott abandoned his struggling Princeton team to coach at Denver in 2007 , athletic director Gary Walters hired Sydney Johnson to take over the program . Johnson emerged from a field of Princeton offense veterans that included Mike Brennan , Robert Burke , Craig Robinson , Bill Carmody , Armond Hill , Chris Mooney , and Mitch Henderson . Johnson 's demeanor as a coach is said by players to be more benevolent than his predecessor , Joe Scott , who left for the University of Denver after compiling a losing record in three years at Princeton . He was regarded as an inexperienced coach because he only had three years of experience as an assistant coach . He became the youngest coach in the Ivy League . Johnson inherited a team that had gone 2 – 12 in conference the prior season and 38 – 45 overall during the prior three season . Among the lowlights that the team had achieved during the Scott era was a 21 @-@ point performance that tied the record for fewest points since the inception of the three point shot and the shot clock . The team had ranked last in the nation in scoring in both 2006 and 2007 . Although race is an issue among collegiate coaching ranks , in Johnson 's first year , he was one of six African @-@ American men 's basketball head coaches in the 8 @-@ team Ivy League . Johnson employs the Princeton offense . Former Tiger stars Brian Earl and Scott Greenman were among Johnson 's assistants at Princeton . 
 After a tumultuous first season of rebuilding during which it posted a 3 – 11 record , Princeton began to show great improvement in 2008 – 2009 . Even with only three games left on their schedule and a 7 – 4 conference record , they still controlled their own destiny for a possible postseason bid . They finished 13 – 14 with an 8 – 6 record in the Ivy League , which tied them with Yale for second place . Along the way , the Tigers defeated Fordham , UNC @-@ Greensboro , and Lehigh during their non @-@ conference schedule and also notched wins over Harvard twice . One highlight of the season was an early season victory over eventual Ivy League champs Cornell who had possessed a 19 @-@ game Ivy League winning streak . The Ivy League does not name a coach of the year in any sport , but Collegeinsider.com named Johnson Ivy League Coach of the Year . 
 During Johnson 's third season , the 2009 – 10 team rebounded from a 2 – 4 start to win 20 of its final 25 games and earn a berth in the 2010 College Basketball Invitational . Princeton 's 22 wins were its most since 1999 , as were its two postseason wins , and the postseason berth was its first since 2004 . In the March 17 , opening round game at home , Princeton defeated the Duquesne Dukes 65 – 51 . The game was Princeton 's first postseason appearance since the 2003 – 04 team went to the 2004 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament and the first postseason victory since the 1998 – 99 team won two games in the 1999 National Invitation Tournament . On March 22 , the team defeated IUPUI 74 – 68 in double overtime at IUPUI Gymnasium in Indianapolis , Indiana . The Tigers had previously won in the postseason in Indianapolis when the Johnson @-@ led 1995 – 96 team pulled off a first round upset of the national defending champion UCLA in the 1996 Tournament . In the tournament semifinals the team was defeated by Saint Louis University 69 – 59 at <unk> Arena in St. Louis , Missouri on March 24 . Johnson again earned Collegeinsider.com Coach of the Year . 
 In 2010 , Johnson tweaked the motion Princeton offense to be a bit more uptempo , resulting in more possessions and higher scores . On March 5 , 2010 , the 2010 – 11 team had a chance to clinch an outright 2010 – 11 Ivy League men 's basketball season championship , but lost to Harvard who clinched a share of the title . Following the game , Johnson made his team sit on the bench and watch the Harvard fans celebrate . On March 8 , Princeton defeated Penn to force a one @-@ game playoff at the Payne Whitney Gymnasium in New Haven , Connecticut . On March 12 , Princeton earned the Ivy League 's automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament , making the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament for the first time since 2004 and 24th time in school history by defeating Harvard 63 – 62 . Princeton was awarded the number thirteen seed and a first round match against the Kentucky Wildcats . Kentucky had eliminated Ivy League representative Cornell the prior season . Kentucky emerged victorious by a 59 – 57 margin on a last second layup . He was named as a finalist for the Hugh Durham Award , the Ben Jobe Award , and the Skip Prosser Award .

 In April 2011 , Johnson accepted a head coaching position at Fairfield University , replacing Ed Cooley . He coached the 2011 – 12 Stags to the semifinals of the 2012 CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament where they lost to Mercer , after defeating Yale , Manhattan and Robert Morris to finish with a 22 – 15 record . Mercer went on to win the tournament . For the second season in a row , he was a finalist for the Ben Jobe Award . The 2012 – 13 team started the season 10 – 10 ( 2 – 6 ) before winning five consecutive and seven out of eight Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference games . The team then lost its two final conference games to finish 9 – 9 in conference . Eventually the team finished 19 – 15 ( 9 – 9 ) .

 = Battle of the Chinese Farm = 
 The Battle of the Chinese Farm took place during October 15 to October 17 , 1973 between the Egyptian Army and the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) , as part of the Yom Kippur War . It was fought in the Sinai Peninsula , north of the Great Bitter Lake and just east of the Suez Canal , near an Egyptian agricultural research station . The farm featured specialized Japanese @-@ made machinery ; Israeli soldiers mistook Japanese characters on this equipment for Chinese , leading to the area being labeled ' Chinese Farm ' on Israeli military maps . The battle began when the IDF launched Operation Abiray @-@ Lev ( " Stouthearted Men " ) , attempting to establish a corridor to the canal and allow bridges to be laid for a crossing . Accordingly , the Israelis attacked Egyptian forces in and around the Chinese Farm . 
 Determined Egyptian resistance made progress extremely slow for the Israelis , who suffered heavy losses . The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but were unable to make much headway , only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day . Suffering from a lack of infantry , the Israelis brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16 / 17 . They were tasked with clearing anti @-@ tank defenses for the armor , but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire . The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for the Israelis to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected . Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers . 
 The Egyptians attempted to restore their defenses to their initial dispositions with an armored attack on October 17 . It initially succeeded , but was pushed back by Israeli counterattacks in an armored battle lasting the entire day . Seriously depleted by the continuous fighting , the Egyptians relinquished control of the routes to the canal , opening them up to the Israelis . The battle is remembered as one of the most costly and brutal battles of the war . 
 = = Background = = 
 On October 6 , 1973 , Egypt launched Operation Badr , intending to cross the Suez Canal and establish bridgeheads on the opposite bank of the Sinai Peninsula , which had been occupied by Israel since 1967 . Coordinated with a Syrian assault on the Golan Heights , the crossing achieved tactical surprise and was a success . Thereafter , counterattacks by Israeli reserves were unsuccessful . By October 10 , fighting along the front had come to a lull . The Egyptians dug in and hoped to wear down the Israelis by attrition , while remaining within range of their ground surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles , which provided air cover from the west bank of the canal , while the Israelis focused on directing their main efforts against the Syrians in the Golan and reorganizing their battered forces . Israeli failures led to the replacement of the chief of the Israeli Southern Command , Major General Shmuel Gonen , with Chaim Bar @-@ Lev , although Gonen was retained as his aide . 
 The situation changed when Sadat , in the face of protests from his senior commanders , ordered an offensive to seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes , hoping to relieve Israeli pressure on the Syrians . The resulting offensive was ill @-@ planned and ill @-@ executed , culminating in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving any of its objectives . This gave the Israelis the initiative to launch a counteroffensive . 
 On October 14 , immediately following the Egyptian offensive , Israeli Chief of Staff David Elazar presented the general outlines of a crossing operation of the Suez Canal to the Israeli cabinet in a meeting in Tel Aviv . Elazar emphasized the military and political gains of the operation , and the expected collapse that would occur in the Egyptian forces on the east bank when their supply routes became threatened . Elazar received unanimous support from the cabinet . Later that day , Bar @-@ Lev headed a meeting attended by the senior and main division commanders in the Sinai theatre : Major Generals Abraham Adan , Ariel Sharon and Kalman Magen . Bar @-@ Lev informed the Israeli officers of the decision to begin the crossing operation on the night of October 15 / 16 , and assigned duties and responsibilities to the division commanders .

 According to the plan set for the Israeli crossing , Operation <unk> @-@ <unk> ( Hebrew for " Stouthearted Men " ) , the designated crossing point lay near to Deversoir , at the northern end of the Great Bitter Lake on the Suez Canal . The Israelis had to open the principal route to Deversoir and secure a corridor stretching 5 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) north of the crossing site ( known as " The Yard " ) . Paratroopers and armor would then cross the canal to establish a 5 @-@ kilometer @-@ deep bridgehead ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) , after which the bridges would be laid , with at least one to be operational by the morning of October 16 . The Israelis would then cross to the west bank and attack south and west , with the end goal of reaching Suez , thus encircling and cutting off two Egyptian divisions on the east bank . Southern Command allotted 24 hours for the setting up of the bridgehead and 24 hours for Israeli forces to reach Suez , with the latter expected to be under Israeli control by October 18 at the latest . It would soon be shown that the execution of Operation Stouthearted Men would deviate from planning and schedules and that the time @-@ frame had been highly optimistic and extremely unrealistic . 
 = = = Order of Battle = = = 
 Major General Ariel Sharon 's 143rd Armored Division was <unk> the critical tasks of opening the corridors and laying the bridges . His division included Tuvia Raviv 's 600th Armored Brigade , Colonel Amnon Reshef 's 14th Armored Brigade , and the ' Haim ' Brigade commanded by Colonel Haim Erez . Major General Abraham Adan 's 162nd Armored Division was tasked with crossing the canal and achieving an encirclement with its 300 tanks . The division included Colonel Natke Nir 's 217th Armored Brigade , Colonel Gabi Amir 's 460th Armored Brigade and Aryeh Keren 's 500th Armored Brigade . A paratrooper brigade would be transferred to Adan 's division during the course of the battle . Kalman Magen 's 252nd Armored Division would initially launch diversionary attacks elsewhere to draw attention from Sharon 's operations at Deversoir . Thereafter the division would hold and secure the corridor and bridgehead . 
 Egyptian forces in the area formed the southern flank of the Second Field Army . These units were the 21st Armored Division , commanded by Brigadier General Ibrahim Oraby , and the 16th Infantry Division , commanded by Brigadier General Abd Rab el @-@ Nabi Hafez . In addition to being the division commander , Hafez also commanded forces within his division 's bridgehead , which included the 21st Division . Oraby 's unit included the 1st Armored Brigade , under Colonel Sayed Saleh ; the 14th Armored Brigade , under Colonel Othman Kamel ; and the 18th Mechanized Brigade , under Colonel Talaat Muslim . Hafez 's 16th Division included the 16th Infantry Brigade , commanded by Colonel Abd el @-@ Hamid Abd el @-@ Sami ' , as well as the 116th Infantry and the 3rd Mechanized Brigades . 
 = = = Location of battle and deployment of forces = = = 
 Two main roads led to Deversoir . The first was the Tasa @-@ Tel Salam Road , codenamed Akavish by the Israelis . This road connected Artillery Road ( running north to south 15 kilometers ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) east of the canal ) to Lexicon Road ( running north to south directly east of the canal ) . The Lexicon @-@ Akavish junction fell on Tel Salaam , near the Great Bitter Lake and 6 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) south of <unk> , where Fort Lakekan ( part of the Bar Lev Line ) was located . The second road , codenamed Tirtur , ran north of Akavish . It too connected Artillery Road to Lexicon , but provided a direct route to " the Yard " . The Lexicon @-@ Tirtur junction fell on Fort Matzmed . This fortification , which consisted of two strongpoints 500 meters ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) apart , had been captured on October 9 by a small assault force , while Fort Lakekan had been evacuated without any combat on October 8 . The importance of both fortifications lay in their control of the Lexicon @-@ Akavish and Lexicon @-@ Tirtur junctions . Both forts , however , were in the designated buffer zone , 35 kilometers ( 22 mi ) long , between the Second and Third Armies . It was believed this area would not need defending , as it was both adjacent to the Great Bitter Lake , a natural obstacle , and most of it lay outside the range of the Egyptian SAMs . Thus they were left unoccupied by the local Egyptian commander , who chose not to extend his defenses southwards . The Egyptian negligence to occupy and defend both forts would greatly assist the Israelis in Operation Stouthearted Men . 
 Just north of the Lexicon @-@ Tirtur junction was the village of al @-@ Galaa . Prior to the 1967 Six Day War , the village had been the site of an agricultural project . This agricultural station incorporated several irrigation ditches and specialized Japanese @-@ made machinery . When the Sinai came under Israeli occupation , Israeli soldiers unwittingly mistook the Japanese characters for Chinese ones , leading to the location being labeled ' Chinese Farm ' on military maps . Just north and north @-@ west of Chinese Farm was a hill mass known by its Israeli codename ' Missouri ' . During Operation Badr , al @-@ Galaa and the Chinese Farm fell within the designated bridgehead of the 16th Infantry Division . Abd el @-@ Hamid 's 16th Infantry Brigade occupied and defended these locations . After partaking in the initial canal @-@ crossing , the brigade , along with the rest of the division , faced an attack by Raviv 's brigade on October 9 . The Israelis achieved some initial gains , but were repelled by the end of the day . Also located within 16th Division 's bridgehead , as of October 13 , was the 21st Armored Division . Its units were positioned in the center and the north of the bridgehead . The 14th Brigade had been involved in the crossing and , along with the 1st Brigade , participated in the Egyptian offensive on October 14 ; as a result , it had lost half of its operational tank strength . In the aftermath , Oraby 's efforts to reorganize and replace armored losses were hampered by frequent artillery barrages and air strikes . On October 15 , there were 136 tanks in the Egyptian bridgehead , unevenly split among Oraby 's brigades : 66 with the 1st Armored Brigade , 39 with the 14th Armored Brigade , and 31 in the 18th Mechanized Brigade . Despite their heavy losses , the Egyptian forces in the bridgehead outnumbered Reshef 's force . 
 Early on the morning of October 15 , Adan moved his division from its positions in the north to a concentration area west of Tasa in preparation for the crossing . Sharon 's division had been in the central sector since its arrival at the Sinai Front , along with the crossing equipment and bridges since October 13 . Sharon had his headquarters in Tasa , 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) east of the canal .

 After receiving his orders late on October 14 from Bar @-@ Lev , Sharon headed to his headquarters to prepare for the operation . His division incorporated Raviv 's Brigade , Colonel Amnon Reshef 's 14th Armored Brigade , and the ' Haim ' Brigade commanded by Colonel Haim Erez . Attached to his division was the 243rd Paratrooper Brigade commanded by Colonel Dani Matt . 
 Sharon planned for Raviv 's brigade to attack from the east , diverting Egyptian attention away from Deversoir . Erez was tasked with transporting a pre @-@ constructed roller bridge to the crossing area at Deversoir , while one of his tank battalions would be attached to the paratroopers . Colonel Reshef was given the most critical tasks of all . Accordingly , his brigade was heavily reinforced to incorporate four armored and three mechanized infantry battalions , in addition to the division 's reconnaissance battalion , commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <unk> Brom . His brigade would conduct a turning maneuver at 6 : 00 AM on October 15 south of Akavish Road , move through the sand dunes to reach Fort Lakekan , before heading north to occupy Fort Matzmed . Reshef 's brigade would then split up to clear the Akavish and <unk> Roads and seize the Chinese Farm , while occupying the crossing area and awaiting Matt 's brigade . Matt 's paratrooper brigade , containing an additional tank company and the armored battalion , would move south @-@ west via Akavish to reach Fort Matzmed . From there , it would continue on to the Yard and cross the canal at 11 : 00 PM , using rubber dinghies and rafts for the tanks . 
 Matt 's brigade began moving to Tasa at 4 : 30 PM on October 15 , before turning eastwards on Akavish . Heavy congestion on the roads made the brigade 's progress very slow . A little after midnight , the brigade left Akavish and moved westward to the Yard , an area 700 meters long and 150 meters wide surrounded by protective sand walls . The site had been made long before the war . 
 Reshef maneuvered his brigade as planned , entering into the previously discovered gap without any opposition . Leaving a combined recon and paratrooper force at the canal , he sent his tanks north and west to secure the flank of the projected crossing site and clear the Akavish and Tirtur roads from behind for the follow @-@ on bridging equipment . He seized the Lakekan and Matzmed fortifications without resistance . Reshef informed Sharon that the forts were under control and that Akavish was clear . Sharon in turn informed Southern Command of these successes , sending a wave of jubilation through the Israeli commanders , delighted that the operation had begun so smoothly . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Matt had been informed that the crossing area and its environs were clear of Egyptian forces , but out of caution , ordered his tank company to deploy at the Lexicon @-@ Tirtur junction to confront any Egyptian movements towards the crossing site , just 800 meters ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) south of the crossroads . The entire company was wiped out after it was ambushed by Egyptian infantry of the 16th Brigade . The company commander was killed and most of his men were casualties , unbeknownst to Matt . Meanwhile , Israeli artillery batteries opened fire on the landing site on the west bank , delivering around 70 tons of shells and ordnance . In fact , the opposite bank was completely clear of Egyptian troops . The crossing finally got underway at 1 : 35 AM , over five hours behind schedule . By 9 : 00 AM , 2 @,@ 000 paratroopers had crossed , along with a battalion of thirty tanks . The Israelis sent raiding parties attacking Egyptian SAMs on the west bank , while securing a 4 @-@ kilometer @-@ deep bridgehead ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) without facing resistance . 
 Tuvia Raviv 's armored brigade began its diversionary attack against the 16th Division 's bridgehead at 5 : 00 PM on October 15 , striking at the bridgehead 's center from the east , after a fire preparation . It was repulsed by the Egyptians , as had been expected , but succeeded in its purpose . When the 16th Division 's southern flank came under increasing Israeli attack , the Egyptians assumed that the Israeli objective was to roll up the Second Army 's right flank , not to open a corridor to the west bank for Israeli forces to cross the canal . For the next 24 hours , this remained the general impression among Egyptian commanders , and they reacted accordingly . Had they discovered the Israelis ' true intentions earlier , the Egyptians would almost certainly have been able to defeat the Israeli operation , in light of the greater strength of their forces and reserves near the Deversoir area , on the east and west banks of the Suez Canal . 
 = = = Lexicon @-@ Tirtur junction = = = 
 While the paratroopers prepared to cross , Reshef was informed that Akavish had been closed again by Egyptian infantry units soon after his passing . He sent one armored battalion to clear the road and committed his remaining three armored and three mechanized battalions to push northwards and secure Tirtur and the Chinese Farm . 
 An infantry battalion , forming the right flank of Abd el @-@ Hamid 's 16th Brigade , was in position to defend the Lexicon @-@ Tirtur crossroads . Initially , Reshef sent two armored battalions northward on Lexicon . As the Israeli tanks neared the infantry battalion , they were met by heavy fire from anti @-@ tank weapons . They lost 27 tanks during this engagement , although seven Israeli tanks managed to break through the battalion 's westernmost position on Lexicon and advance northwards to al @-@ Galaa ' . Thereafter , ' Abd el @-@ Hamid ordered tank @-@ hunting squads – groups of ten equipped with RPG @-@ 7 rockets and RPG @-@ 43 grenades – to deploy around al @-@ Galaa ' and destroy those tanks that broke through ; he also sent a tank company to reinforce the infantry battalion . 
 At night , Reshef moved with his remaining forces north along the canal bank . Bypassing the 16th Brigade 's positions , the Israelis soon found themselves in the center of a huge administrative area and vehicle park . Reshef 's brigade had stumbled into the command and supply bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions . The base was located near the canal on the assumption that it was the safest location from Israeli attacks , which was expected to come from the east , where the defenses were the strongest , not from the south , where they were the weakest . Both sides immediately opened fire , inadvertently leading to the destruction of supply trucks and SAM launchers . The Egyptians managed to organize a counterattack by units of the 21st Division ; a battalion of the 14th Brigade and a battalion ( less one company ) of the 18th Brigade . The tanks repelled the Israelis , who sustained significant losses from vastly overwhelming opposing forces . 
 Brigadier General Hafez , commanding the 16th Infantry Division , planned to contain the Israeli attack from the south by having the 18th Mechanized Brigade occupy defenses north of the Chinese Farm , directly behind the 16th Infantry Brigade , but without its organic tank battalion , which was designated as part of the division 's reserve . The 1st Armored Brigade moved southward to occupy positions between Lateral Road and the canal on the right flank of the 18th Brigade . Upon the brigade 's arrival , it engaged Israeli armor from Reshef 's brigade in al @-@ Galaa ' ; Egyptian armor destroyed around 15 tanks and several half @-@ tracks . At around 1 : 00 PM , sorties of Egyptian Su @-@ 7s destroyed many Israeli tanks in ground @-@ attack missions over al @-@ Galaa ' village . The 1st Brigade countered a flanking attempt on its left at 2 : 00 PM by a tank battalion , thwarting the attack and destroying ten tanks . During its engagements on October 16 , the 21st Division managed to destroy over 50 Israeli tanks and APCs , while subjected to frequent Israeli air strikes and artillery barrages . The 1st Brigade accounted for most of the kills , while suffering fewer losses . 
 Meanwhile , one of Reshef 's mechanized battalions , commanded by Major Nathan Shunari , was reinforced with company @-@ sized remnants of the 40th Tank Battalion , now commanded by Captain Gideon Giladi after the previous battalion commander had been wounded . Shunari was ordered to seize the Lexicon @-@ Tirtur junction . He sent the tank company ahead first , which initially reported no Egyptian units . Shunari dispatched an infantry unit in six half @-@ tracks to the junction . Upon reaching it , they discovered that the tank company had already been destroyed and Giladi killed . Soon the vehicles began came under heavy fire , stopping their advance . The unit commander reported casualties , and Shunari ordered the remainder of his battalion to aid the pinned @-@ down men . Attempts to rescue the infantry failed , and the Egyptian battalion defending the junction directed heavy firepower against the area , aided by the brigade 's artillery . The Egyptian defenders had managed to catch the Israelis in a prepared killing zone . Shunari , whose troops lacked cover and were threatened with annihilation , regrouped some of his forces and managed to escape the area in vehicles , but the infantry half @-@ track unit first sent to the crossroads remained pinned down . 
 Reshef sent another tank company to rescue the infantrymen . The tanks advanced towards the Chinese Farm from the south . As they neared the farm and the village , a downpour of anti @-@ tank and artillery fire forced the company to retreat . Nathan kept pleading with <unk> to send additional support , unaware he was facing superior Egyptian forces after entering the administrative bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions . With no help coming , the unit commander had his men carry the wounded and attempted to leave the battlefield , tasking two sections of heavy machine guns with providing cover to the force . As the Israelis slowly made their way back to their lines , a group of Egyptian tanks intercepted and wiped out the Israeli force . 
 Despite the debacle , Reshef remained determined to seize the junction , giving the task to the division 's reconnaissance battalion attached to his brigade . To achieve surprise , the battalion maneuvered to attack at 3 : 00 AM from the west , as the Egyptians were preparing for further attacks from the south and east . As the Israelis attacked , Lieutenant Colonel Brom was killed barely thirty meters from Egyptian positions , disrupting his battalion 's assault . The Israelis sustained losses , but managed to retreat . Soon after , a tank company attacked the crossroads at 4 : 00 AM on October 16 , but also withdrew after losing three tanks . 
 By 4 : 00 AM on October 16 , Reshef 's brigade , which had begun the operation with 97 tanks , had lost 56 in just twelve hours of fighting , leaving only 41 remaining . Although seizing the crossing site had been accomplished easily , stiff resistance had prevented Reshef from achieving his remaining objectives , namely opening the routes to the canal and securing a corridor . Reshef 's force would further drop to just 27 tanks by noon . As a whole , Sharon 's division suffered some 300 killed and 1 @,@ 000 wounded that night . To help Reshef secure the corridor , Sharon supplied him with two tank battalions by 6 : 00 PM , propping his numbers up to 81 tanks . 
 Hearing reports of the heavy fighting taking place between the junction and the Chinese Farm , Dayan suggested withdrawing Matt 's brigade and canceling the operation . He voiced concerns that the paratroopers were threatened with annihilation and noted that all attempts to open a corridor for the bridges had failed . Gonen rejected the suggestion , stating that , " If we knew in advance this was going to happen we would not have started the crossing operation , but now that we have crossed then let us follow through to the bitter end . " Bar @-@ Lev concurred with Gonen , and Dayan decided not to press his suggestion . At around 6 : 00 AM , Golda Meir telephoned Dayan to inquire about the situation . Dayan informed her that the bridges had not yet been laid and that the Egyptians had closed the routes leading to <unk> . He also stated there were high hopes that Egyptian resistance would be overcome and that the bridges would be laid during the morning . Dayan also told her that Matt 's paratrooper brigade had crossed to the west bank without encountering resistance and that Southern Command , as yet , had no intentions of withdrawing the brigade , even if the bridge @-@ laying was delayed . 
 Shortly after dawn , Reshef conducted a reconnaissance of the battlefield from a hilltop . He saw that the Egyptians had set up a strong blocking position defending the junction , composed of Egyptian tanks situated in hull @-@ down positions and infantrymen in foxholes and the now @-@ dry irrigation ditches of the Chinese Farm . The infantry were from the 16th Brigade 's right @-@ flank battalion and had the support of recoilless rifles , RPG @-@ 7s , and some manually guided AT @-@ 3 Sagger missiles . Reshef discovered that the Egyptians had mined both sides of Lexicon Road , to which he had lost several of his tanks . 
 Reshef decided to change tactics . He personally commanded the 40th Armored Battalions , after reinforcing it with tanks salvaged and repaired from the previous night 's fighting , and maneuvered to attack from the west – from the direction of the canal – hitting Egyptian positions in the flank , while a tank company and an infantry company attacked from south to north . Reshef 's forces engaged the Egyptians from long range , picking off defensive positions from afar , while using alternate fire and movement to advance to the crossroads . The defending infantry battalion , exhausted by continuous fighting and suffering from a severe lack of ammunition , soon withdrew allowing the Israelis to at last seize the junction . 
 In the meantime , other difficulties were surfacing . Sharon reported to Southern Command that one section of the roller bridge , being towed by Erez 's brigade , had been damaged and that the engineers needed a few hours to repair it . He also requested additional forces to help secure the corridor , noting the stiff resistance facing Reshef 's brigade . Sharon 's report prompted Bar @-@ Lev to alert Adan to prepare to open the corridor with his division . Sharon argued for Adan 's division to cross the canal on rafts and to proceed with Operation Abiray @-@ Lev without waiting for the bridges . Both Gonen and Bar @-@ Lev rejected Sharon 's suggestion since , without a secure corridor to the canal , Israeli forces on the west bank would be threatened with encirclement . Subsequently , Bar @-@ Lev ordered that no more Israeli forces or equipment would cross to the west bank until the bridges had been laid . 
 After receiving reinforcements , Reshef focused on clearing the Tirtur Road . He left a battalion of around 30 tanks between the junction and the western part of the Chinese Farm , and prepared to attack with two armored battalions provided by Sharon . He concentrated on the section of the Tirtur Road defended by an Egyptian battalion forming the left flank of the 16th Infantry Brigade . One of Reshef 's battalions attacked from the north @-@ east , the other from the west . The Egyptian battalion managed to halt the advance , aided by fire from tanks and anti @-@ tank weapons on the slopes of Missouri , a hill north @-@ west of the Chinese Farm , causing Reshef to break off his attack . 
 This last attempt left Reshef 's brigade in a desperate situation . He had 27 tanks remaining and was running short on ammunition and supplies . Reshef requested authorization from Sharon to withdraw his brigade to Fort Lakekan to regroup his forces and regain combat effectiveness . 
 = = = Israeli reinforcement = = = 
 The unexpected Egyptian resistance forced Israeli Southern Command to change its plans . Visiting Adan 's advance command post , Gonen noted that " Sharon has disappointed us " and handed Adan the task of moving the pontoon bridge to the canal . Adan was to prepare to clear the Akavish and Tirtur Roads to deploy the bridges . Gonen informed Sharon of Adan 's new orders and tasked Sharon with capturing the Chinese Farm and Egyptian positions near the farm and the canal . Needing to regroup his forces , Sharon suggested that he capture the farm once Adan had cleared the routes to the canal , and Gonen consented . In a later meeting with Dayan and Bar @-@ Lev , Gonen reiterated the latter 's statement that no more forces would cross until the bridges had been laid , and added that , should the situation worsen , the paratroopers could be withdrawn . 
 The 162nd Division , concentrated south of Tasa , had been standing by to cross the canal since dawn on October 16 . The division advanced towards the canal , but movement was hampered by the massive traffic jams on the roads leading to the canal . When Adan realized that Akavish was closed , he ordered a tank battalion to make a turning maneuver through the desert to reach Deversoir . When it arrived , Sharon contacted Adan , explaining Reshef 's difficult situation , and requested that the battalion be placed under his command . Adan accepted , and Sharon in turn authorized Reshef 's request to pull back and regroup , replacing his brigade with the tank battalion . 
 After receiving his new orders , Adan moved his division to occupy a series of positions opposite ' Abd el @-@ Hamid 's 16th Brigade . One of Adan 's armored brigades had been placed as a reserve force under Southern Command . ' Abd el @-@ Hamid 's left @-@ flank infantry battalion , blocking Tirtur , repelled Israeli tanks attacking westwards and thwarted Adan 's efforts to clear the road . Adan realized that , without infantry support , breaking through the Egyptian positions would prove costly . However , at 2 : 00 PM , Southern Command notified Adan that he was soon receive the 35th Paratrooper Brigade , which had been transported by helicopters from Ras Sudar on the Gulf of Suez to <unk> 80 kilometers ( 50 mi ) east of the canal . The brigade made its way to the canal in buses and was greatly delayed by the traffic on Akavish road . Adan had expected the unit to arrive well before dusk , but the brigade commander , Colonel Uzi Ya 'iri , only arrived at 10 : 00 PM . The rest of his brigade soon arrived , transported by helicopters after the buses had come to a complete standstill . 
 = = = Paratrooper effort = = = 
 Adan met Ya 'iri at Adan 's former command post . Adan briefly explained the situation and , in a short discussion , Ya 'iri laid out his plan . He was tasked with clearing Akavish and Tirtur . At 11 : 30 PM , the paratroopers began moving , with a battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Yitzhak Mordechai spearheading the advance . Ya 'iri , acting with a sense of urgency , had decided to go into action without awaiting sufficient intelligence , or performing adequate reconnaissance on Egyptian defenses . His unit lacked artillery observers and , rather than wait for one to arrive , it was agreed the paratroopers would request fire support of the 162nd Division 's command net . The brigade was acting without armor support . 
 After some time , Mordechai 's battalion had reached an area where Tirtur and Akavish were closest , the distance between them no wider than 2 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) . At around 2 : 45 AM , they came into contact with Abd el @-@ Hamid 's left @-@ flank battalion , positioned around Tirtur . The battalion directed effective artillery fire against the paratroopers , who were also receiving heavy machine @-@ gun and small @-@ arms fire from entrenched Egyptian infantry . The paratroopers attempted to assault the machine @-@ gun positions , in places advancing to within a few meters of Egyptian lines . The paratrooper companies spread out , but repeatedly failed to reach the defenses . Israeli artillery fire was ineffective . Egyptian infantry were able to suppress the paratroopers ' movement and thwart flanking attempts . Most company and platoon commanders were killed or wounded . Adan ordered Ya 'iri to narrow his brigade 's front and focus on clearing Akavish instead , but the lead paratrooper battalion was under such heavy fire that it was impossible to maneuver . 
 With dawn nearing , Adan realized that if the pontoon bridge could not be brought to the canal during the few remaining hours of dark , an entire day would pass without a bridge being laid across the canal , and in daylight , the paratroopers would sustain more casualties . He sent a half @-@ track company to reconnoiter Akavish at 3 : 00 . Half an hour later , the company reported it had reached the crossing site without encountering any resistance . The Egyptian battalion fighting the paratroopers had focused all their attention on the Israelis at Tirtur , ignoring activity on Akavish . Adan took a risky decision , sending the irreplaceable pontoons down Akavish to the canal . IDF bulldozers cleared the road of wreckage and debris , and the Israelis reached Fort Lakekan before turning northwards , finally reaching the crossing site . Bridge construction was started immediately by military engineers of the 143rd Division . 
 At dawn , Ya 'iri requested approval from Adan to withdraw his brigade , the paratroopers having thus far been unsuccessful in reaching Egyptian lines . Gonen denied the request , approving only medevac for the wounded . This was countermanded after Bar @-@ Lev visited Adan at his command post and realized the gravity of the paratroopers ' situation . An armored battalion was tasked with covering the paratroopers , but was unable to locate them . The paratroopers released red smoke to pinpoint their position , but this backfired as the Egyptians also spotted the smoke , directing accurate artillery fire against them and inflicting further casualties . The tanks assaulted the defenses , but suffered losses and fell back . It became evident that withdrawal could not be accomplished in the open ; APCs and half @-@ tracks were brought up to extract the paratroopers and the wounded — all the while under fire . The Israelis finally withdrew under cover of friendly tanks . In 14 hours of almost uninterrupted combat , the paratroopers suffered heavy casualties , with some 40 – 70 killed and 100 wounded . Ya 'iri would state that " We had suffered seventy casualties because we went into action too hastily , without proper intelligence on the enemy 's defenses . " Armored losses sustained during the withdrawal were also heavy . 
 = = = Egyptian withdrawal = = = 
 The Israeli armored brigades , principally those of Nir , Amir and Raviv , continued engaging the 16th Brigade after the paratroopers were withdrawn . The Israelis concentrated air and artillery attacks against 21st Division 's units from 5 : 00 AM . The Egyptians estimated there were upwards of 80 Israeli tanks attacking their positions . At around 7 : 00 AM on October 17 , the 21st Division received orders to evict Israeli armor from the vicinity of al @-@ Galaa ' village and capture Fort Matzmed , as part of a larger Egyptian effort to seal the Israeli penetration and destroy the bridgehead on the west bank . Since Oraby had the 18th Mechanized Brigade in defensive positions and stripped of its tank battalion , and the 14th Brigade defending other parts of the Egyptian bridgehead , he tasked the 1st Brigade to execute the attack with its remaining 53 tanks . At 8 : 00 AM , the Egyptians conducted an air and artillery strike on the area for some fifteen minutes , after which the attack commenced . Egyptian tanks managed to destroy Israeli armor near the village and reached the northern strongpoint of Fort Matzmed just after 9 : 00 AM in the face of heavy resistance . However , they were soon repelled by Israeli ground fire supported by air strikes . Israeli tanks then counterattacked and managed to advance significantly . The armored battle continued in a see @-@ saw fashion until 9 : 00 PM , by which time the 1st Brigade had restored its original lines . Meanwhile , an 5 : 00 PM attack by one of the 18th Brigade 's mechanized infantry battalions on al @-@ Galaa ' failed with heavy losses , and ten tanks were then allocated to the brigade . Israeli armor had occupied irrigation ditches around the farm and were entrenched in them , which significantly enhanced their defensive position . Egyptian attacks directed against the Israeli corridor or the bridgehead failed , with heavy losses . 
 The 1st Brigade had just 33 tanks remaining after losing 20 tanks . This prompted Second Army command to transfer a battalion of 21 tanks on October 18 from the 2nd Infantry Division to the north to reinforce the dwindling tank numbers in 16th Division 's bridgehead . As the battalion moved south , a large number of Israeli aircraft attacked the formation , forcing it to undertake evasive maneuvers , turning eastwards and fanning out in the desert terrain , thereby avoiding losses . The battalion was then attached to the 21st Division . 
 Abd el @-@ Hamid meanwhile reported the dire situation of his forces at 5 : 30 PM on October 17 . The 16th Brigade had been in heavy combat for three consecutive days – ammunition was becoming scarce , and the brigade was heavily outnumbered and outgunned due to its losses , including the destruction of its artillery units . Abd el @-@ Hamid received orders from 16th Division headquarters to retreat . His brigade abandoned its Chinese Farms positions and reinforced the lines of the 18th Mechanized Brigade to the north during the night of October 17 / 18 . This finally opened the Tirtur and Akavish roads to Israeli forces , ensuring Operation Abiray @-@ Lev would proceed . Missouri remained in Egyptian hands though , posing a threat to the Israeli corridor to the canal . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 At around 4 : 00 PM on October 17 , the pontoon bridge had been fully assembled , opening the first Israeli bridge across the canal . The roller bridge was laid soon after at dawn on October 18 , and by afternoon , Adan 's division crossed to the west bank followed by Kalman Magen 's division . Adan , supported by Magen , would go on to reach Suez after the failure of a United Nations ceasefire , thereby cutting off two infantry divisions of the Egyptian Third Field Army . Sharon also crossed with part of his division , simultaneously trying to defend and expand the Israeli corridor to the Suez Canal — as well attacking northwards on the west bank to Ismailia in an attempt to similarly cut off the Second Army . His efforts bogged down , and he was unable to reach Ismailia ( see Battle of Ismailia ) , while attempts to seize critical positions and expand the Israeli corridor on the east bank saw little to no success . 
 While ultimately an Israeli victory , the Battle of the Chinese Farm has an especially infamous legacy among Israeli participants , and it is remembered as one of the most brutal battles of the war — and for the heavy losses incurred by both the Egyptians and Israelis . After the battle had ended , Dayan visited the area of the battlefield . Reshef , who accompanied him , said , " Look at this valley of death . " The minister , taken aback by the great destruction before him , muttered in an undertone , " What you people have done here ! " Later , Dayan would recount that : " I am no novice at war or battle scenes , but I have never seen such a sight , not in reality , or in paintings , or in the worst war movies . Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the eye could see . " Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath : " It was as if a hand @-@ to @-@ hand battle of armor had taken place ... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side @-@ by @-@ side , soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together . No picture could capture the horror of the scene , none could encompass what had happened there . " 
 The losses suffered by both the Egyptians and the Israelis in the battle were severe . Israeli units suffered heavy casualties in men and equipment ; Reshef 's armored losses during the first night of the battle alone were comparable to Egyptian armored losses on the disastrous October 14 offensive . For their part , the numbers of Egyptian armored forces within 16th Division 's bridgehead severely dwindled . As of 18 October the 21st Armored Division had no more than 40 tanks remaining of an original 136 tanks available at the start of the battle ( not counting 21 tanks received as reinforcements ) , while the 16th Infantry Division had just 20 tanks remaining in its organic tank battalion . This attrition served Egypt 's war strategy of inflicting maximum casualties on the Israelis , even though , from another perspective , the initiative had passed to the Israelis during the battle .

 Among the participants of the battle were Mohamed Hussein Tantawi and Ehud Barak , then lieutenant colonels . Tantawi commanded an infantry battalion under the 16th Infantry Brigade . He engaged Reshef 's armor during October 16 and later Mordechai 's paratroopers during the night of October 16 / 17 , and was decorated for valor during the battle . Barak commanded an armored battalion during the battle and personally led the armored effort to extricate the Israeli paratroopers . Both men would later serve as Ministers of Defense in their respective nations and encounter each other again in that capacity .

 " Homer Goes to College " is the third episode of The Simpsons ' fifth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 14 , 1993 . In the episode , Homer 's lack of a college degree is revealed and he is sent to Springfield University to pass a nuclear physics class . Homer , who bases his perception of college on comedy films and TV shows , goofs around and is sent to a group of boys for tutoring . The boys , who are stereotypical nerds , try to help Homer , but he instead tries to help them party and decides to pull a prank on another college .

 = = Plot = = 
 During a surprise inspection of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , Homer is placed in a test module van that simulates an emergency . He has no idea what to do and starts pressing buttons at random , somehow causing a nuclear meltdown even though there was no nuclear material inside the van . The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer 's job requires college training in nuclear physics , and that he must go back to college to keep his job . Homer is rejected by every college he applies to , but Burns helps him get into Springfield University . 
 Homer ignores his studies and instead focuses on his preconceived notions of college life through adolescent movies and TV shows , such as the fictional The School of Hard <unk> , which stereotype college life as pranks , partying and rigid deans . He also insults the college dean , Dean Peterson , believing him to be a crusty , conservative administrator . In reality , Peterson relates well with the students and is relatively young . Homer acts like a know @-@ it @-@ all in class and is asked to demonstrate how a proton accelerator operates ; consequently , he causes a nuclear meltdown in class . Dean Peterson takes him aside and recommends hiring a tutor . The tutors turn out to be three computer nerds named Benjamin , Doug , and Gary . The trio try to help Homer understand the material from his physics course , but he refuses to cooperate . Instead , he is determined to help them gain a social life by pulling a prank on rival college Springfield A & M University . The prank involves kidnapping the other school 's mascot , a pig named Sir <unk> @-@ a @-@ lot . However , Homer causes the pig to become very ill after feeding it malt liquor , and Benjamin , Doug , and Gary are blamed for the incident . 
 Dean Peterson is forced to expel the nerds , and a remorseful Homer immediately invites them to move in with his family . However , their presence quickly disrupts the normal family routine , and Marge orders Homer to evict them , leading him to try to get the three re @-@ admitted to the school . Homer 's plan involves an attempt to run down Dean Peterson with his car , but have the nerds push Peterson out of the way at the last moment , with the hope that Peterson would readmit the nerds out of gratitude for saving his life . But the plan backfires , and Homer winds up running down the dean , seriously injuring him . At the hospital , Homer admits he was fully responsible for the pranks , and asks that Benjamin , Doug , and Gary be reinstated . The dean agrees to reinstate them and does not punish Homer , agreeing to forget everything that has happened . The nerds thank Homer for his assistance and move back into their old dormitory room . 
 Unfortunately , having been preoccupied with the nerd situation , Homer is not prepared for his final exam . The nerds say the only way to pass is to cram for the final exam , which they help him do . However , despite Homer 's best attempts , he gets an F. To Homer 's delight , the nerds hack into the school 's student records and change his grade to an A + , but unfortunately , Marge finds out and forces Homer to take the course again in order to set a good example for Bart and Lisa . Homer 's next college experience is shown during the end credits , with college clichés such as hazing by a fraternity , Telephone Booth <unk> , a food fight , and finally his graduation ceremony where Homer flashes the audience .

 " Homer Goes to College " was the final episode of the show for which Conan O 'Brien received sole writing credit ; his final writing credit altogether was for the episode " Treehouse of Horror IV " , which he co @-@ wrote with five other writers . O 'Brien would leave the series halfway through the production of the season to host his own show , Late Night with Conan O 'Brien on NBC . O 'Brien was informed that he had been hired by NBC not long before the recording session for this episode began , and he was forced to walk out on his contract . The concept of the episode was that Homer attends college , but bases his entire understanding of what college is on " bad Animal House rip @-@ off movies " . O 'Brien mentioned in the DVD commentary that the antics of the characters Benjamin , Doug , and Gary were based on three " incredible nerds " who lived in the same college dormitory as O 'Brien . 
 The Fox Network executives had wanted the season premiere to be " Homer Goes to College " because it was an Animal House parody . However , the writers felt that " Homer 's Barbershop Quartet " would be a better episode because of George Harrison 's involvement . During the episode , Homer sings " I am so smart ! S @-@ M @-@ R @-@ T ... I mean S @-@ M @-@ A @-@ R @-@ T ! " while he lights his high school diploma ( and the house ) on fire . During the recording session , Dan Castellaneta was singing the song and accidentally misspelled " smart " . The writers decided that it was much funnier that way , because it seemed like something Homer Simpson would do , so they left the joke in . The song has since become a fan favorite . 
 Jim Reardon directed the episode and has noted he remembers the episode for several scenes in which the action is viewed through windows , such as when Homer prank calls the dean . The animators were short on time , so for the design of Benjamin they took an earlier drawing of director Rich Moore and made it African @-@ American .

 The episode contains several references to the film Animal House , including the song " Louie Louie " by The Kingsmen which plays throughout the film . The couch gag with the huge pink foot squashing the Simpsons is a reference to The Foot of Cupid of the television series Monty Python 's Flying Circus . The film Monty Python and the Holy Grail is also referenced when Benjamin , Doug , and Gary imitate the Knights who say Ni . They play Dungeons & Dragons , hold arguments over Star Trek , and their room number is 222 , a reference to the television series Room 222 . Homer has posters of Albert Einstein and W. C. Fields . The episode contains the first reference to the Internet on The Simpsons , as " computer signals " being sent between the Nerds and MIT . A picture in the dorm shows four men wearing silver dome hats resembles the ' 80s new wave band Devo . The phrases the nerds say when Homer greets them ( Intruder Alert ) , ( Get the <unk> ! ) are from the 1980 arcade game Berzerk . 
 Mr. Burns asks Homer to " find the jade monkey " in a reference to the film The Maltese Falcon . He also offers the nuclear inspectors a washer and dryer or the contents of a mysterious box , which parodies the gameshow Let 's Make a Deal . Mr. Burns ' escape pod resembles the one used by R2 @-@ D2 and C @-@ 3PO in the first Star Wars film . Mr. Burns tries to get Homer into college by using violence and hitting one of the members of the admissions committee with a baseball bat , a reference to the film The Untouchables .

 The episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , wrote , " Homer at his most excruciatingly stupid in another superb episode — his attitude to the college 's ' stuffy old dean ' ( who was , in fact , bassist for The Pretenders ) is a joy . " Thomas Rozwadowski of the Green Bay Press @-@ Gazette listed Homer 's line " Curly , straight . Curly , straight " whilst he torments the pig as " instantly memorable " . DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson commented that it did not " quite live up to its two predecessors " Homer 's Barbershop Quartet " and " Cape Feare " this year , but it remains a strong show nonetheless . Actually , it starts a little slowly but builds steam along the way . It includes some classic moments of a Homer idiocy — hard to beat him chasing squirrels with a stick — and one of the better visual gags via Burns ’ chair . Who can dislike a show in which Richard Nixon threatens Homer due to a drunken pig ?

 = Hurricane Babe = 
 Hurricane Babe was the second named storm and the first to impact the United States during the below @-@ average 1977 Atlantic hurricane season . Forming out of a tropical wave on September 3 , Babe began as a subtropical cyclone in the eastern Gulf of Mexico . The storm gradually intensified as it tracked westward . On September 5 , the storm turned north and acquired enough tropical characteristics . Later that day , Babe intensified into a hurricane and attained its peak strength with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 995 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 38 inHg ) . Several hours later , the hurricane made landfall in Louisiana and quickly weakened . By September 6 , Babe had weakened to a tropical depression and later dissipated early on September 9 over North Carolina . 
 Hurricane Babe produced minimal impact throughout its path in the United States . The most significant impact occurred in Louisiana where the storm caused $ 10 million ( 1977 USD ; $ 39 million 2016 USD ) in damage , mainly from crop losses . An additional $ 3 million ( 1977 USD ; $ 11 @.@ 7 million 2016 USD ) in losses resulted from tornadoes spawned by Babe . Heavy rainfall in North Carolina , peaking at 8 @.@ 99 in ( 228 mm ) triggered flash flooding but little damage . No fatalities resulted from the hurricane . Coincidentally , a typhoon , also named Babe , existed at exactly the same time as Hurricane Babe . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Babe originated from a tropical wave that exited the western coast of Africa on August 23 . Tracking westward , the wave eventually entered the Gulf of Mexico on September 2 . Upon entering the gulf , a surface circulation developed ; however , convection associated with the system was not concentrated around the center . The newly formed system then interacted with an upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex situated near the Florida coastline . The following day , Convective banding features around the cyclone led to the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) upgrading the system to Tropical Storm Babe . Although classified a tropical storm , Babe was not fully tropical , it was later classified as a subtropical cyclone . The forward motion of Babe had slowed significantly from when it was a wave but maintained the westward direction . 
 By September 4 , the maximum winds were found closer to the center of circulation and the cyclone developed a warmer core , a main feature in tropical cyclones . An anticyclone also developed over Babe and later that day , the storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone . By this time , Babe had turned nearly due north and was near hurricane @-@ status . Around this time , reconnaissance missions into the storm found a closed eyewall with an eye measuring roughly 23 mi ( 37 km ) in diameter . Another reconnaissance flight that day found sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) ; however , these winds were located roughly 65 mi ( 100 km ) from the center and considered to be unrepresentative of the storm 's actual intensity . 
 Early on September 5 , reconnaissance found a central barometric pressure of 995 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 38 inHg ) , the lowest recorded in relation to the storm . Around this time , Babe also intensified into a hurricane , attaining maximum winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . Later that day , Hurricane Babe made landfall near Cocodrie , Louisiana and quickly weakened to a tropical storm . By landfall , the eye of Babe had contracted to roughly 14 mi ( 23 km ) . On September 6 , the storm had weakened to a tropical depression and was moving northeast into Mississippi . The system continued this movement for the following two days . While crossing South Carolina , forecasters thought that the system would emerge into the Atlantic Ocean and regenerate into a tropical depression . However , the remnants of Babe dissipated shortly before crossing into North Carolina early on September 9 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Upon the storm 's formation on September 3 , gale warnings were issued for areas along the north @-@ central coast of the Gulf of Mexico . By September 5 , hurricane warnings were posted for areas between Vermilion Bay to the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana . These warnings were later discontinued as the system moved over land . Ahead of the storm , up to 30 @,@ 000 residents in low @-@ lying parts of the state moved inland . However , press reports indicate that upwards of 45 @,@ 000 residents had evacuated from coastal regions prior to the storm . In Grand Isle , roughly 200 civil defense workers stayed behind in the town hall after the cities 2 @,@ 300 residents evacuated . In Cameron Parish , roughly 8 @,@ 000 residents evacuated inland . Emergency shelters were set up throughout Louisiana to house evacuees during the storm . As Hurricane Babe began to weaken over Louisiana , forecasters anticipated the formation of tornadoes and issued tornado watches for parts of Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi , Georgia and Florida . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Prior to becoming a subtropical depression , Babe produced scattered rainfall in Florida , with peak amounts near 3 in ( 76 mm ) falling around Lake Okeechobee . Widespread rain fell in relation to Babe throughout the Southern United States . In Louisiana , rain was confined to eastern parts of the state , with up to 10 in ( 250 mm ) being measured near the Mississippi border . The remnants of the hurricane continued to produce heavy rain through its dissipation over North Carolina . A storm peak of 10 @.@ 99 in ( 279 mm ) fell in Lafayette , Georgia . Most of North Carolina received between 3 and 5 in ( 76 and 127 mm ) of rain with isolated areas exceeding 7 in ( 180 mm ) . A state maximum of 8 @.@ 99 in ( 228 mm ) fell in Lake <unk> , North Carolina , 7 @.@ 05 in ( 179 mm ) in Caesars Head , South Carolina and 6 @.@ 62 in ( 168 mm ) in Chattanooga , Tennessee . 
 Upon making landfall , Babe produced a storm surge of 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) , leading to minor coastal flooding . Due to the storm 's quick deterioration after moving inland , the NHC presumed that hurricane @-@ force winds did not impact land . The highest wind gust was recorded in Grand Isle , Louisiana at 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) and the highest sustained wind was recorded in Boothville , Louisiana at 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . In Jean Lafitte , Louisiana , overflow from the Fleming Canal produced flooding throughout the area . The most significant damage was to croplands inundated by flood waters . Flash flooding occurred throughout the path of the former hurricane in the eastern United States , particularly in North Carolina . 
 Hurricane Babe produced 14 tornadoes between September 5 and 7 along its track in several states . Louisiana recorded the most , with six touchdowns , including one F2 that injured one person and caused $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( 1977 USD ; $ 9 @.@ 76 million 2016 USD ) in damages near Hammond in Tangipahoa Parish . A country store sustained severe damage from the tornado , with most of the back of the store destroyed . Six wood @-@ frame homes were also knocked off their cinder block supports . Another F2 touched down in Tuscaloosa County , Alabama ; however , minimal damage was recorded along its 8 mi ( 13 km ) track . Another F2 briefly touched down in Harrison County , Mississippi on September 6 . It struck an unoccupied elementary school , wrecking six classrooms and leaving $ 500 @,@ 000 ( 1977 USD ; $ 1 @.@ 95 million 2016 USD ) in damages . Throughout the storm 's path , damages amounted to $ 10 million ( 1977 USD ; $ 39 million 2016 USD ) with an additional $ 3 million ( 1977 USD ; $ 11 @.@ 7 million 2016 USD ) from tornadoes . There was no loss of life due to Babe .

His image is found throughout India , Sri Lanka and Nepal . Hindu sects worship him regardless of affiliations . Devotion to Ganesha is widely diffused and extends to Jains and Buddhists . 
 Although he is known by many attributes , Ganesha 's elephant head makes him easy to identify . Ganesha is widely revered as the remover of obstacles , the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom . As the god of beginnings , he is honoured at the start of rituals and ceremonies . Ganesha is also invoked as patron of letters and learning during writing sessions . Several texts relate mythological anecdotes associated with his birth and exploits and explain his distinct iconography . 
 Ganesha emerged as a distinct deity in the 4th and 5th centuries CE , during the Gupta period , although he inherited traits from Vedic and pre @-@ Vedic precursors . He was formally included among the five primary deities of Smartism ( a Hindu denomination ) in the 9th century . A sect of devotees called the Ganapatya arose , who identified Ganesha as the supreme deity . The principal scriptures dedicated to Ganesha are the Ganesha Purana , the Mudgala Purana , and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa . 
 = = Etymology and other names = = 
 Ganesha has been ascribed many other titles and epithets , including Ganapati ( Ganpati ) and Vighneshvara . The Hindu title of respect Shri ( Sanskrit : श ् री ; IAST : <unk> ; also spelled Sri or Shree ) is often added before his name . 
 The name Ganesha is a Sanskrit compound , joining the words gana ( gaṇa ) , meaning a group , multitude , or categorical system and <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning lord or master . The word <unk> when associated with Ganesha is often taken to refer to the <unk> , a troop of semi @-@ divine beings that form part of the retinue of Shiva , Ganesha 's father . The term more generally means a category , class , community , association , or corporation . Some commentators interpret the name " Lord of the <unk> " to mean " Lord of Hosts " or " Lord of created categories " , such as the elements . Ganapati ( <unk> ; gaṇapati ) , a synonym for Ganesha , is a compound composed of gaṇa , meaning " group " , and pati , meaning " ruler " or " lord " . Though the earliest mention of the word Ganapati is found in hymn 2 @.@ 23 @.@ 1 of the 2nd @-@ millennium BCE Rigveda , it is however uncertain that the Vedic term referred specifically to Ganesha . The <unk> , an early Sanskrit lexicon , lists eight synonyms of Ganesha : Vinayaka , <unk> ( equivalent to <unk> ) , <unk> ( one who has two mothers ) , <unk> ( equivalent to Ganapati and Ganesha ) , Ekadanta ( one who has one tusk ) , Heramba , Lambodara ( one who has a pot belly , or , literally , one who has a hanging belly ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) ; having the face of an elephant . 
 Vinayaka ( <unk> ; <unk> ) is a common name for Ganesha that appears in the <unk> and in Buddhist Tantras . This name is reflected in the naming of the eight famous Ganesha temples in Maharashtra known as the Ashtavinayak ( Marathi : अष ् <unk> , aṣṭavināyaka ) . The names <unk> ( <unk> ् <unk> ; <unk> ) and Vighneshvara ( <unk> ् <unk> ् <unk> ; <unk> ) ( Lord of Obstacles ) refers to his primary function in Hinduism as the master and remover of obstacles ( <unk> ) . 
 A prominent name for Ganesha in the Tamil language is Pillai ( Tamil : <unk> ் <unk> ) or Pillaiyar ( <unk> ் <unk> ் ) . A. K. Narain differentiates these terms by saying that <unk> means a " child " while <unk> means a " noble child " . He adds that the words <unk> , <unk> , and pell in the Dravidian family of languages signify " tooth or tusk " , also " elephant tooth or tusk " . Anita Raina Thapan notes that the root word <unk> in the name Pillaiyar might have originally meant " the young of the elephant " , because the Pali word <unk> means " a young elephant " . 
 In the Burmese language , Ganesha is known as Maha <unk> ( <unk> ္ <unk> , pronounced : [ <unk> <unk> ] ) , derived from Pali Mahā <unk> ( <unk> ) . The widespread name of Ganesha in Thailand is Phra <unk> . The earliest images and mention of Ganesha names as a major deity in present @-@ day Indonesia , Thailand , Cambodia and Vietnam date from the <unk> and 8th @-@ centuries , and these mirror Indian examples of the 5th @-@ century or earlier . 
 In Sri Lankan <unk> Buddhist areas he is known as Gana deviyo , and revered along with Buddha , Vishnu , Skanda and others . 
 = = Iconography = = 
 Ganesha is a popular figure in Indian art . Unlike those of some deities , representations of Ganesha show wide variations and distinct patterns changing over time . He may be portrayed standing , dancing , heroically taking action against demons , playing with his family as a boy , sitting down or on an elevated seat , or engaging in a range of contemporary situations . 
 Ganesha images were prevalent in many parts of India by the 6th century . The 13th century statue pictured is typical of Ganesha statuary from 900 – 1200 , after Ganesha had been well @-@ established as an independent deity with his own sect . This example features some of Ganesha 's common iconographic elements . A virtually identical statue has been dated between 973 – 1200 by Paul Martin @-@ Dubost , and another similar statue is dated c . 12th century by <unk> Pal . Ganesha has the head of an elephant and a big belly . This statue has four arms , which is common in depictions of Ganesha . He holds his own broken tusk in his lower @-@ right hand and holds a delicacy , which he samples with his trunk , in his lower @-@ left hand . The motif of Ganesha turning his trunk sharply to his left to taste a sweet in his lower @-@ left hand is a particularly archaic feature . A more primitive statue in one of the Ellora Caves with this general form has been dated to the 7th century . Details of the other hands are difficult to make out on the statue shown . In the standard configuration , Ganesha typically holds an axe or a goad in one upper arm and a pasha ( noose ) in the other upper arm . In rare instances , he may be depicted with a human head . 
 The influence of this old constellation of iconographic elements can still be seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha . In one modern form , the only variation from these old elements is that the lower @-@ right hand does not hold the broken tusk but is turned towards the viewer in a gesture of protection or fearlessness ( abhaya mudra ) . The same combination of four arms and attributes occurs in statues of Ganesha dancing , which is a very popular theme . 
 = = = Common attributes = = = 
 Ganesha has been represented with the head of an elephant since the early stages of his appearance in Indian art . Puranic myths provide many explanations for how he got his elephant head . One of his popular forms , Heramba @-@ Ganapati , has five elephant heads , and other less @-@ common variations in the number of heads are known . While some texts say that Ganesha was born with an elephant head , he acquires the head later in most stories . The most recurrent motif in these stories is that Ganesha was created by Parvati using clay to protect her and Shiva beheaded him when Ganesha came between Shiva and Parvati . Shiva then replaced Ganesha 's original head with that of an elephant . Details of the battle and where the replacement head came from vary from source to source . Another story says that Ganesha was created directly by Shiva 's laughter . Because Shiva considered Ganesha too alluring , he gave him the head of an elephant and a protruding belly . 
 Ganesha 's earliest name was Ekadanta ( One <unk> ) , referring to his single whole tusk , the other being broken . Some of the earliest images of Ganesha show him holding his broken tusk . The importance of this distinctive feature is reflected in the Mudgala Purana , which states that the name of Ganesha 's second incarnation is Ekadanta . Ganesha 's protruding belly appears as a distinctive attribute in his earliest statuary , which dates to the Gupta period ( 4th to 6th centuries ) . This feature is so important that , according to the Mudgala Purana , two different incarnations of Ganesha use names based on it : Lambodara ( Pot Belly , or , literally , Hanging Belly ) and <unk> ( Great Belly ) . Both names are Sanskrit compounds describing his belly ( IAST : <unk> ) . The Brahmanda Purana says that Ganesha has the name Lambodara because all the universes ( i.e. , cosmic eggs ; IAST : <unk> ) of the past , present , and future are present in him . The number of Ganesha 's arms varies ; his best @-@ known forms have between two and sixteen arms . Many depictions of Ganesha feature four arms , which is mentioned in Puranic sources and codified as a standard form in some iconographic texts . His earliest images had two arms . Forms with 14 and 20 arms appeared in Central India during the 9th and the 10th centuries . The serpent is a common feature in Ganesha iconography and appears in many forms . According to the Ganesha Purana , Ganesha wrapped the serpent Vasuki around his neck . Other depictions of snakes include use as a sacred thread ( IAST : <unk> ) wrapped around the stomach as a belt , held in a hand , coiled at the ankles , or as a throne . Upon Ganesha 's forehead may be a third eye or the sectarian mark ( IAST : tilaka ) , which consists of three horizontal lines . The Ganesha Purana prescribes a tilaka mark as well as a crescent moon on the forehead . A distinct form of Ganesha called <unk> ( IAST : <unk> ; " Moon on the <unk> " ) includes that iconographic element . Ganesha is often described as red in color . Specific colors are associated with certain forms . Many examples of color associations with specific meditation forms are prescribed in the Sritattvanidhi , a treatise on Hindu iconography . For example , white is associated with his representations as Heramba @-@ Ganapati and Rina @-@ <unk> @-@ Ganapati ( Ganapati Who Releases from Bondage ) . Ekadanta @-@ Ganapati is visualized as blue during meditation in that form . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The earliest Ganesha images are without a vahana ( mount / vehicle ) . Of the eight incarnations of Ganesha described in the Mudgala Purana , Ganesha uses a mouse ( shrew ) in five of them , a lion in his incarnation as <unk> , a peacock in his incarnation as <unk> , and Shesha , the divine serpent , in his incarnation as <unk> . <unk> uses a lion , <unk> uses a peacock , <unk> uses a horse , and <unk> uses a mouse , in the four incarnations of Ganesha listed in the Ganesha Purana . Jain depictions of Ganesha show his vahana variously as a mouse , elephant , tortoise , ram , or peacock . 
 Ganesha is often shown riding on or attended by a mouse , shrew or rat . Martin @-@ Dubost says that the rat began to appear as the principal vehicle in sculptures of Ganesha in central and western India during the 7th century ; the rat was always placed close to his feet . The mouse as a mount first appears in written sources in the Matsya Purana and later in the Brahmananda Purana and Ganesha Purana , where Ganesha uses it as his vehicle in his last incarnation . The Ganapati Atharvashirsa includes a meditation verse on Ganesha that describes the mouse appearing on his flag . The names <unk> ( mouse @-@ mount ) and <unk> ( rat @-@ banner ) appear in the Ganesha Sahasranama . 
 The mouse is interpreted in several ways . According to Grimes , " Many , if not most of those who interpret Gaṇapati 's mouse , do so negatively ; it symbolizes <unk> as well as desire " . Along these lines , Michael <unk> says it symbolizes those who wish to overcome desires and be less selfish . Krishan notes that the rat is destructive and a menace to crops . The Sanskrit word <unk> ( mouse ) is derived from the root <unk> ( stealing , robbing ) . It was essential to subdue the rat as a destructive pest , a type of <unk> ( impediment ) that needed to be overcome . According to this theory , showing Ganesha as master of the rat demonstrates his function as <unk> ( Lord of Obstacles ) and gives evidence of his possible role as a folk <unk> @-@ <unk> ( village deity ) who later rose to greater prominence . Martin @-@ Dubost notes a view that the rat is a symbol suggesting that Ganesha , like the rat , penetrates even the most secret places . 
 = = Associations = = 
 = = = Removal of Obstacles = = = 
 Ganesha is Vighneshvara or <unk> or <unk> ( Marathi ) , the Lord of Obstacles , both of a material and spiritual order . He is popularly worshipped as a remover of obstacles , though traditionally he also places obstacles in the path of those who need to be checked . Paul Courtright says that " his task in the divine scheme of things , his dharma , is to place and remove obstacles . It is his particular territory , the reason for his creation . " 
 Krishan notes that some of Ganesha 's names reflect shadings of multiple roles that have evolved over time . <unk> ascribes the quick ascension of Ganesha in the Hindu pantheon , and the emergence of the Ganapatyas , to this shift in emphasis from <unk> ( obstacle @-@ creator ) to <unk> ( obstacle @-@ <unk> ) . However , both functions continue to be vital to his character . 
 = = = Buddhi ( Knowledge ) = = = 
 Ganesha is considered to be the Lord of letters and learning . In Sanskrit , the word buddhi is a feminine noun that is variously translated as intelligence , wisdom , or intellect . The concept of buddhi is closely associated with the personality of Ganesha , especially in the Puranic period , when many stories stress his cleverness and love of intelligence . One of Ganesha 's names in the Ganesha Purana and the Ganesha Sahasranama is Buddhipriya . This name also appears in a list of 21 names at the end of the Ganesha Sahasranama that Ganesha says are especially important . The word <unk> can mean " fond of " , and in a marital context it can mean " lover " or " husband " , so the name may mean either " Fond of Intelligence " or " Buddhi 's Husband " . 
 = = = Aum = = = 
 Ganesha is identified with the Hindu mantra Aum , also spelled Om . The term <unk> ( Aum is his form ) , when identified with Ganesha , refers to the notion that he personifies the primal sound . The Ganapati Atharvashirsa attests to this association . <unk> translates the relevant passage as follows : 
 ( O Lord Ganapati ! ) You are ( the Trinity ) Brahma , Vishnu , and <unk> . You are Indra . You are fire [ Agni ] and air [ <unk> ] . You are the sun [ <unk> ] and the moon [ <unk> ] . You are Brahman . You are ( the three worlds ) <unk> [ earth ] , <unk> @-@ loka [ space ] , and <unk> [ heaven ] . You are Om . ( That is to say , You are all this ) . 
 Some devotees see similarities between the shape of Ganesha 's body in iconography and the shape of Aum in the Devanāgarī and Tamil scripts . 
 = = = First chakra = = = 
 According to Kundalini yoga , Ganesha resides in the first chakra , called Muladhara ( <unk> ) . Mula means " original , main " ; <unk> means " base , foundation " . The <unk> chakra is the principle on which the manifestation or outward expansion of primordial Divine Force rests . This association is also attested to in the Ganapati Atharvashirsa . Courtright translates this passage as follows : " You continually dwell in the sacral plexus at the base of the spine [ <unk> <unk> ] . " Thus , Ganesha has a permanent abode in every being at the Muladhara . Ganesha holds , supports and guides all other chakras , thereby " governing the forces that propel the wheel of life " . 
 = = Family and consorts = = 
 Though Ganesha is popularly held to be the son of Shiva and Parvati , the Puranic myths give different versions about his birth . In some he was created by Parvati , in another he was created by Shiva and Parvati , in another he appeared mysteriously and was discovered by Shiva and Parvati or he was born from the elephant headed goddess Malini after she drank Parvati 's bath water that had been thrown in the river . 
 The family includes his brother , the god of war , Kartikeya , who is also called Skanda and Murugan . Regional differences dictate the order of their births . In northern India , Skanda is generally said to be the elder , while in the south , Ganesha is considered the first born . In northern India , Skanda was an important martial deity from about 500 BCE to about 600 CE , after which worship of him declined significantly . As Skanda fell , Ganesha rose . Several stories tell of sibling rivalry between the brothers and may reflect sectarian tensions . 
 Ganesha 's marital status , the subject of considerable scholarly review , varies widely in mythological stories . One pattern of myths identifies Ganesha as an unmarried <unk> . This view is common in southern India and parts of northern India . Another pattern associates him with the concepts of Buddhi ( intellect ) , Siddhi ( spiritual power ) , and Riddhi ( prosperity ) ; these qualities are sometimes personified as goddesses , said to be Ganesha 's wives . He also may be shown with a single consort or a nameless servant ( Sanskrit : <unk> ) . Another pattern connects Ganesha with the goddess of culture and the arts , Sarasvati or <unk> ( particularly in Maharashtra ) . He is also associated with the goddess of luck and prosperity , Lakshmi . Another pattern , mainly prevalent in the Bengal region , links Ganesha with the banana tree , Kala Bo . 
 The Shiva Purana says that Ganesha had begotten two sons : <unk> ( prosperity ) and Lābha ( profit ) . In northern Indian variants of this story , the sons are often said to be Śubha ( <unk> ) and Lābha . The 1975 Hindi film Jai Santoshi Maa shows Ganesha married to Riddhi and Siddhi and having a daughter named Santoshi Ma , the goddess of satisfaction . This story has no Puranic basis , but Anita Raina Thapan and Lawrence Cohen cite Santoshi Ma 's cult as evidence of Ganesha 's continuing evolution as a popular deity . 
 = = Worship and festivals = = 
 Ganesha is worshipped on many religious and secular occasions , especially at the beginning of ventures such as buying a vehicle or starting a business . <unk> Somayaji says , " there can hardly be a [ Hindu ] home [ in India ] which does not house an idol of Ganapati . ... Ganapati , being the most popular deity in India , is worshipped by almost all castes and in all parts of the country " . Devotees believe that if Ganesha is propitiated , he grants success , prosperity and protection against adversity . 
 Ganesha is a non @-@ sectarian deity . Hindus of all denominations invoke him at the beginning of prayers , important undertakings , and religious ceremonies . Dancers and musicians , particularly in southern India , begin art performances such as the Bharatnatyam dance with a prayer to Ganesha . Mantras such as Om Shri <unk> Namah ( Om , salutation to the Illustrious Ganesha ) are often used . One of the most famous mantras associated with Ganesha is Om <unk> <unk> Namah ( Om , <unk> , <unk> to the Lord of Hosts ) . 
 Devotees offer Ganesha sweets such as <unk> and small sweet balls called <unk> . He is often shown carrying a bowl of sweets , called a <unk> . Because of his identification with the color red , he is often worshipped with red sandalwood paste ( <unk> ) or red flowers . <unk> grass ( Cynodon dactylon ) and other materials are also used in his worship . 
 Festivals associated with Ganesh are Ganesh Chaturthi or Vināyaka <unk> in the <unk> ( the fourth day of the waxing moon ) in the month of Bhadrapada ( August / September ) and the Ganesh Jayanti ( Ganesha 's birthday ) celebrated on the <unk> of the <unk> ( fourth day of the waxing moon ) in the month of <unk> ( January / February ) . " 
 = = = Ganesh Chaturthi = = = 
 An annual festival honours Ganesha for ten days , starting on Ganesha Chaturthi , which typically falls in late August or early September . The festival begins with people bringing in clay idols of Ganesha , symbolising Ganesha 's visit . The festival culminates on the day of Ananta <unk> , when idols ( murtis ) of Ganesha are immersed in the most convenient body of water . Some families have a tradition of immersion on the 2nd , 3rd , 5th , or 7th day . In 1893 , Lokmanya Tilak transformed this annual Ganesha festival from private family celebrations into a grand public event . He did so " to bridge the gap between the Brahmins and the non @-@ Brahmins and find an appropriate context in which to build a new grassroots unity between them " in his nationalistic strivings against the British in Maharashtra . Because of Ganesha 's wide appeal as " the god for Everyman " , Tilak chose him as a rallying point for Indian protest against British rule . Tilak was the first to install large public images of Ganesha in pavilions , and he established the practice of submerging all the public images on the tenth day . Today , Hindus across India celebrate the Ganapati festival with great fervour , though it is most popular in the state of Maharashtra . The festival also assumes huge proportions in Mumbai , Pune , and in the surrounding belt of Ashtavinayaka temples . 
 = = = Temples = = = 
 In Hindu temples , Ganesha is depicted in various ways : as an acolyte or subordinate deity ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) ; as a deity related to the principal deity ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) ; or as the principal deity of the temple ( <unk> ) , treated similarly to the highest gods of the Hindu pantheon . As the god of transitions , he is placed at the doorway of many Hindu temples to keep out the unworthy , which is analogous to his role as Parvati ’ s doorkeeper . In addition , several shrines are dedicated to Ganesha himself , of which the Ashtavinayak ( Sanskrit : अष ् <unk> ; aṣṭavināyaka ; lit . " eight Ganesha ( shrines ) " ) in Maharashtra are particularly well known . Located within a 100 @-@ kilometer radius of the city of Pune , each of the eight shrines celebrates a particular form of Ganapati , complete with its own lore and legend . The eight shrines are : Morgaon , <unk> , Pali , <unk> , Theur , Lenyadri , <unk> and <unk> . 
 There are many other important Ganesha temples at the following locations : Wai in Maharashtra ; Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh ; Jodhpur , <unk> and Raipur ( Pali ) in Rajasthan ; <unk> in Bihar ; Baroda , <unk> , and Valsad in Gujarat and <unk> Temple in Varanasi , Uttar Pradesh . Prominent Ganesha temples in southern India include the following : <unk> in Chittoor ; the <unk> Temple at Tiruchirapalli ; at <unk> and <unk> in Tamil Nadu ; at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Kasargod in Kerala , Hampi , and <unk> in Karnataka ; and Bhadrachalam in Andhra Pradesh . 
 T. A. <unk> notes , " Every village however small has its own image of <unk> ( <unk> ) with or without a temple to house it in . At entrances of villages and forts , below <unk> ( Sacred fig ) trees ... in a niche ... in temples of <unk> ( Vishnu ) as well as Śiva ( Shiva ) and also in separate shrines specially constructed in Śiva temples ... the figure of <unk> is invariably seen . " Ganesha temples have also been built outside of India , including Southeast Asia , Nepal ( including the four Vinayaka shrines in the Kathmandu valley ) , and in several western countries .

 The symbolic form and identity of Ganesha , in his classic form , is generally accepted to have occurred between the 4th- to 5th @-@ century CE . Shanti Lal Nagar says that the earliest known iconic image of Ganesha is in the niche of the Shiva temple at <unk> , which has been dated to the Gupta period . His independent cult was well established by about the 10th century . Narain summarizes the lack of evidence about Ganesha 's history before the 5th @-@ century as follows : 
 What is inscrutable is the somewhat dramatic appearance of Gaņeśa on the historical scene . His antecedents are not clear . His wide acceptance and popularity , which transcend sectarian and territorial limits , are indeed amazing . On the one hand there is the pious belief of the orthodox devotees in Gaņeśa 's Vedic origins and in the Purāṇic explanations contained in the confusing , but nonetheless interesting , mythology . On the other hand there are doubts about the existence of the idea and the icon of this deity " before the fourth to fifth century A.D. ... [ I ] n my opinion , indeed there is no convincing evidence [ in ancient Brahmanic literature ] of the existence of this divinity prior to the fifth century . 
 The evidence for more ancient Ganesha , suggests Narain , may reside outside Brahmanic or Sanskritic traditions , or outside geocultural boundaries of India . Ganesha appears in China by the 6th @-@ century , states Brown , and his artistic images in temple setting as " remover of obstacles " in South Asia appear by about 400 CE . He is , states Bailey , recognized as goddess Parvati 's son and integrated into Shaivism theology by early centuries of the common era . 
 = = = Possible influences = = = 
 Courtright reviews various speculative theories about the early history of Ganesha , including supposed tribal traditions and animal cults , and dismisses all of them in this way : 
 In this search for a historical origin for Gaņeśa , some have suggested precise locations outside the <unk> tradition .... These historical locations are intriguing to be sure , but the fact remains that they are all speculations , variations on the Dravidian hypothesis , which argues that anything not attested to in the Vedic and Indo @-@ European sources must have come into <unk> religion from the Dravidian or aboriginal populations of India as part of the process that produced Hinduism out of the interactions of the Aryan and non @-@ Aryan populations . There is no independent evidence for an elephant cult or a totem ; nor is there any archaeological data pointing to a tradition prior to what we can already see in place in the Purāṇic literature and the iconography of Gaņeśa . 
 Thapan 's book on the development of Ganesha devotes a chapter to speculations about the role elephants had in early India but concludes that , " although by the second century CE the elephant @-@ headed <unk> form exists it cannot be presumed to represent Gaṇapati @-@ Vināyaka . There is no evidence of a deity by this name having an elephant or elephant @-@ headed form at this early stage . Gaṇapati @-@ Vināyaka had yet to make his debut . " 
 Some have noted the roots of Ganesha worship , dating back to 3 @,@ 000 BCE since the times of Indus Valley Civilization . In 1993 , a metal plate depiction of an elephant @-@ headed figure , interpreted as Ganesha , was discovered in Lorestan Province , Iran , dating back to 1 @,@ 200 BCE . First terracotta images of Ganesha are from 1st century CE found in Ter , Pal , <unk> and <unk> . These figures are small , with elephant head , two arms , and chubby physique . The earliest Ganesha icons in stone were carved in Mathura during Kushan times ( 2nd @-@ 3rd centuries CE ) . 
 One theory of the origin of Ganesha is that he gradually came to prominence in connection with the four Vinayakas ( Vināyakas ) . In Hindu mythology , the Vināyakas were a group of four troublesome demons who created obstacles and difficulties but who were easily propitiated . The name Vināyaka is a common name for Ganesha both in the <unk> and in Buddhist Tantras . Krishan is one of the academics who accepts this view , stating flatly of Ganesha , " He is a non @-@ vedic god . His origin is to be traced to the four Vināyakas , evil spirits , of the <unk> ( 7th – 4th century BCE ) who cause various types of evil and suffering " . Depictions of elephant @-@ headed human figures , which some identify with Ganesha , appear in Indian art and coinage as early as the 2nd century . According to <unk> , the elephant @-@ headed Ganesha as lord of the Ganas was known to the people of Sri Lanka in the early pre @-@ Christian era . 
 = = = Vedic and epic literature = = = 
 The title " Leader of the group " ( Sanskrit : gaṇapati ) occurs twice in the Rig Veda , but in neither case does it refer to the modern Ganesha . The term appears in RV 2 @.@ 23 @.@ 1 as a title for <unk> , according to commentators . While this verse doubtless refers to <unk> , it was later adopted for worship of Ganesha and is still used today . In rejecting any claim that this passage is evidence of Ganesha in the Rig Veda , Ludo Rocher says that it " clearly refers to Bṛhaspati — who is the deity of the hymn — and Bṛhaspati only " . Equally clearly , the second passage ( RV 10 @.@ 112 @.@ 9 ) refers to Indra , who is given the epithet ' gaṇapati ' , translated " Lord of the companies ( of the <unk> ) . " However , Rocher notes that the more recent Ganapatya literature often quotes the Rigvedic verses to give Vedic respectability to Ganesha . 
 Two verses in texts belonging to Black Yajurveda , <unk> <unk> ( 2 @.@ 9 @.@ 1 ) and <unk> <unk> ( 10 @.@ 1 ) , appeal to a deity as " the tusked one " ( <unk> ) , " elephant @-@ faced " ( <unk> ) , and " with a curved trunk " ( <unk> ) . These names are suggestive of Ganesha , and the 14th century commentator Sayana explicitly establishes this identification . The description of <unk> , possessing a twisted trunk ( <unk> ) and holding a corn @-@ sheaf , a sugar cane , and a club , is so characteristic of the Puranic Ganapati that Heras says " we cannot resist to accept his full identification with this Vedic <unk> " . However , Krishan considers these hymns to be post @-@ Vedic additions . Thapan reports that these passages are " generally considered to have been interpolated " . <unk> says , " the references to the elephant @-@ headed deity in the <unk> <unk> have been proven to be very late interpolations , and thus are not very helpful for determining the early formation of the deity " . 
 Ganesha does not appear in Indian epic literature that is dated to the Vedic period . A late interpolation to the epic poem Mahabharata says that the sage Vyasa ( <unk> ) asked Ganesha to serve as his scribe to transcribe the poem as he dictated it to him . Ganesha agreed but only on condition that Vyasa recite the poem uninterrupted , that is , without pausing . The sage agreed , but found that to get any rest he needed to recite very complex passages so Ganesha would have to ask for clarifications . The story is not accepted as part of the original text by the editors of the critical edition of the Mahabharata , in which the twenty @-@ line story is relegated to a footnote in an appendix . The story of Ganesha acting as the scribe occurs in 37 of the 59 manuscripts consulted during preparation of the critical edition . Ganesha 's association with mental agility and learning is one reason he is shown as scribe for <unk> 's dictation of the Mahabharata in this interpolation . Richard L. Brown dates the story to the 8th century , and Moriz <unk> concludes that it was known as early as c . 900 , but it was not added to the Mahabharata some 150 years later . <unk> also notes that a distinctive feature in South Indian manuscripts of the Mahabharata is their omission of this Ganesha legend . The term <unk> is found in some recensions of the <unk> and <unk> that are regarded as interpolations . A reference to <unk> ( " Creator of Obstacles " ) in <unk> is also believed to be an interpolation and does not appear in the critical edition . 
 = = = Puranic period = = = 
 Stories about Ganesha often occur in the Puranic corpus . Brown notes while the Puranas " defy precise chronological ordering " , the more detailed narratives of Ganesha 's life are in the late texts , c . 600 – 1300 . Yuvraj Krishan says that the Puranic myths about the birth of Ganesha and how he acquired an elephant 's head are in the later Puranas , which were composed from c . 600 onwards . He elaborates on the matter to say that references to Ganesha in the earlier Puranas , such as the Vayu and Brahmanda Puranas , are later interpolations made during the 7th to 10th centuries . 
 In his survey of Ganesha 's rise to prominence in Sanskrit literature , Ludo Rocher notes that : 
 Above all , one cannot help being struck by the fact that the numerous stories surrounding Gaṇeśa concentrate on an unexpectedly limited number of incidents . These incidents are mainly three : his birth and parenthood , his elephant head , and his single tusk . Other incidents are touched on in the texts , but to a far lesser extent . 
 Ganesha 's rise to prominence was codified in the 9th century , when he was formally included as one of the five primary deities of Smartism . The 9th @-@ century philosopher Adi Shankara popularized the " worship of the five forms " ( Panchayatana puja ) system among orthodox Brahmins of the Smarta tradition . This worship practice invokes the five deities Ganesha , Vishnu , Shiva , Devi , and Surya . Adi Shankara instituted the tradition primarily to unite the principal deities of these five major sects on an equal status . This formalized the role of Ganesha as a complementary deity . 
 = = = Scriptures = = = 
 Once Ganesha was accepted as one of the five principal deities of Brahmanism , some Brahmins chose Ganesha as their principal deity . They developed the Ganapatya tradition , as seen in the Ganesha Purana and the Mudgala Purana . 
 The date of composition for the Ganesha Purana and the Mudgala Purana — and their dating relative to one another — has sparked academic debate . Both works were developed over time and contain age @-@ layered strata . Anita Thapan reviews comments about dating and provides her own judgement . " It seems likely that the core of the Ganesha Purana appeared around the twelfth and thirteenth centuries " , she says , " but was later interpolated . " Lawrence W. Preston considers the most reasonable date for the Ganesha Purana to be between 1100 and 1400 , which coincides with the apparent age of the sacred sites mentioned by the text . 
 R.C. <unk> suggests that the Mudgala Purana is older than the Ganesha Purana , which he dates between 1100 and 1400 . However , Phyllis <unk> finds problems with this relative dating and concludes that the Mudgala Purana was the last of the philosophical texts concerned with Ganesha . She bases her reasoning on the fact that , among other internal evidence , the Mudgala Purana specifically mentions the Ganesha Purana as one of the four Puranas ( the Brahma , the Brahmanda , the Ganesha , and the Mudgala Puranas ) which deal at length with Ganesha . While the kernel of the text must be old , it was interpolated until the 17th and 18th centuries as the worship of Ganapati became more important in certain regions . Another highly regarded scripture , the Ganapati Atharvashirsa , was probably composed during the 16th or 17th centuries . 
 Ganesha Sahasranama is part of the Puranic literature , and is a litany of a thousand names and attributes of Ganesha . Each name in the sahasranama conveys a different meaning and symbolises a different aspect of Ganesha . Versions of the Ganesha Sahasranama are found in the Ganesha Purana . 
 One of the most important Sanskrit texts , that enjoys authority in Ganapatya tradition states John Grimes , is the Ganapati Atharvashirsa . 
 = = Beyond India and Hinduism = = 
 Commercial and cultural contacts extended India 's influence in Western and Southeast Asia . Ganesha is one of a number of Hindu deities who consequently reached foreign lands . 
 Ganesha was particularly worshipped by traders and merchants , who went out of India for commercial ventures . From approximately the 10th century onwards , new networks of exchange developed including the formation of trade guilds and a resurgence of money circulation . During this time , Ganesha became the principal deity associated with traders . The earliest inscription invoking Ganesha before any other deity is associated with the merchant community . 
 Hindus migrated to Maritime Southeast Asia and took their culture , including Ganesha , with them . Statues of Ganesha are found throughout the region , often beside Shiva sanctuaries . The forms of Ganesha found in the Hindu art of Java , Bali , and Borneo show specific regional influences . The spread of Hindu culture throughout Southeast Asia established Ganesha worship in modified forms in Burma , Cambodia , and Thailand . In Indochina , Hinduism and Buddhism were practiced side by side , and mutual influences can be seen in the iconography of Ganesha in the region . In Thailand , Cambodia , and among the Hindu classes of the Chams in Vietnam , Ganesha was mainly thought of as a remover of obstacles . Today in Buddhist Thailand , Ganesha is regarded as a remover of obstacles , the god of success . 
 Before the arrival of Islam , Afghanistan had close cultural ties with India , and the adoration of both Hindu and Buddhist deities was practiced . Examples of sculptures from the 5th to the 7th centuries have survived , suggesting that the worship of Ganesha was then in vogue in the region . 
 Ganesha appears in Mahayana Buddhism , not only in the form of the Buddhist god Vināyaka , but also as a Hindu demon form with the same name . His image appears in Buddhist sculptures during the late Gupta period . As the Buddhist god Vināyaka , he is often shown dancing . This form , called <unk> Ganapati , was popular in northern India , later adopted in Nepal , and then in Tibet . In Nepal , the Hindu form of Ganesha , known as Heramba , is popular ; he has five heads and rides a lion . Tibetan representations of Ganesha show ambivalent views of him . A Tibetan rendering of Ganapati is <unk> bdag . In one Tibetan form , he is shown being trodden under foot by Mahākāla , ( Shiva ) a popular Tibetan deity . Other depictions show him as the Destroyer of Obstacles , and sometimes dancing . Ganesha appears in China and Japan in forms that show distinct regional character . In northern China , the earliest known stone statue of Ganesha carries an inscription dated to 531 . In Japan , where Ganesha is known as Kangiten , the Ganesha cult was first mentioned in 806 . 
 The canonical literature of Jainism does not mention the worship of Ganesha . However , Ganesha is worshipped by most Jains , for whom he appears to have taken over certain functions of the god of wealth , Kubera . Jain ties with the trading community support the idea that Jainism took up Ganesha worship as a result of commercial connections . The earliest known Jain Ganesha statue dates to about the 9th century . A 15th @-@ century Jain text lists procedures for the installation of Ganapati images . Images of Ganesha appear in the Jain temples of Rajasthan and Gujarat . 
 = Trade route = 
 A trade route is a logistical network identified as a series of pathways and stoppages used for the commercial transport of cargo . The term can also be used to refer to trade over bodies of water . Allowing goods to reach distant markets , a single trade route contains long distance arteries , which may further be connected to smaller networks of commercial and noncommercial transportation routes . Among notable trade routes was the Amber Road , which served as a dependable network for long @-@ distance trade . Maritime trade along the Spice Route became prominent during the Middle Ages , when nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route . During the Middle Ages , organizations such as the Hanseatic League , aimed at protecting interests of the merchants , and trade became increasingly prominent . 
 In modern times , commercial activity shifted from the major trade routes of the Old World to newer routes between modern nation @-@ states . This activity was sometimes carried out without traditional protection of trade and under international free @-@ trade agreements , which allowed commercial goods to cross borders with relaxed restrictions . Innovative transportation of modern times includes pipeline transport and the relatively well @-@ known trade involving rail routes , automobiles , and cargo airlines .

 The period from the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE to the beginning of the Common Era saw societies in Western Asia , the Mediterranean , China and the Indian subcontinent develop major transportation networks for trade . 
 One of the vital instruments which facilitated long distance trade was portage and the domestication of beasts of burden . Organized caravans , visible by the 2nd millennium BCE , could carry goods across a large distance as fodder was mostly available along the way . The domestication of camels allowed Arabian nomads to control the long distance trade in spices and silk from the Far East to the Arabian Peninsula . Caravans were useful in long @-@ distance trade largely for carrying luxury goods , the transportation of cheaper goods across large distances was not profitable for caravan operators . With productive developments in iron and bronze technologies , newer trade routes — dispensing innovations of civilizations — began to rise . 
 = = = Maritime trade = = = 
 Evidence of maritime trade between civilizations dates back at least 90 millennia . Navigation was known in Sumer between the 4th and the 3rd millennium BCE , and was probably known by the Indians and the Chinese people before the Sumerians . The Egyptians had trade routes through the Red Sea , importing spices from the " Land of Punt " ( East Africa ) and from Arabia . 
 Maritime trade began with safer coastal trade and evolved with the manipulation of the monsoon winds , soon resulting in trade crossing boundaries such as the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal . South Asia had multiple maritime trade routes which connected it to Southeast Asia , thereby making the control of one route resulting in maritime monopoly difficult . Indian connections to various Southeast Asian states buffered it from blockages on other routes . By making use of the maritime trade routes , bulk commodity trade became possible for the Romans in the 2nd century BCE . A Roman trading vessel could span the Mediterranean in a month at one @-@ sixtieth the cost of over @-@ land routes . 
 = = = Visible trade routes = = = 
 The peninsula of Anatolia lay on the commercial land routes to Europe from Asia as well as the sea route from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea . Records from the 19th century BCE attest to the existence of an Assyrian merchant colony at <unk> in Cappadocia ( now in modern Turkey ) . Trading networks of the Old World included the Grand Trunk Road of India and the Incense Road of Arabia . A transportation network consisting of hard @-@ surfaced highways , using concrete made from volcanic ash and lime , was built by the Romans as early as 312 BCE , during the times of the Censor Appius Claudius <unk> . Parts of the Mediterranean world , Roman Britain , Tigris @-@ Euphrates river system and North Africa fell under the reach of this network at some point of their history . 
 According to Robert Allen <unk> ( 2000 ) : 
 " The spread of urban trading networks , and their extension along the Persian Gulf and eastern Mediterranean , created a complex molecular structure of regional foci so that as well as the zonation of core and periphery ( originally created around Mesopotamia ) there was a series of interacting civilizations : Mesopotamia , Egypt , the Indus Valley ; then also Syria , central Anatolia ( Hittites ) and the Aegean ( Minoans and Mycenaeans ) . Beyond this was a margin which included not only temperate areas such as Europe , but the dry steppe corridor of central Asia . This was truly a world system , even though it occupied only a restricted portion of the western Old World . Whilst each civilization emphasized its ideological autonomy , all were identifiably part of a common world of interacting components . " 
 These routes - spreading religion , trade and technology - have historically been vital to the growth of urban civilization . The extent of development of cities , and the level of their integration into a larger world system , has often been attributed to their position in various active transport networks .

 The Incense Route served as a channel for trading of Indian , Arabian and East Asian goods . The incense trade flourished from South Arabia to the Mediterranean between roughly the 3rd century BCE to the 2nd century CE . This trade was crucial to the economy of Yemen and the frankincense and myrrh trees were seen as a source of wealth by the its rulers . 
 Ptolemy II Philadelphus , emperor of Ptolemaic Egypt , may have forged an alliance with the <unk> in order to secure the incense route at Dedan , thereby rerouting the incense trade from Dedan to the coast along the Red Sea to Egypt . I. E. S. Edwards connects the Syro @-@ <unk> War to the desire of the Israelites and the Aramaeans to control the northern end of the Incense route , which ran up from Southern Arabia and could be tapped by commanding Transjordan . 
 <unk> - inhabited by Chaldean exiles from Babylon - controlled the Incense trade routes across Arabia to the Mediterranean and exercised control over the trading of aromatics to Babylon in the 1st century BCE . The Nabateans exercised control over the routes along the Incense Route , and their hold was challenged - without success - by Antigonus Cyclops , emperor of Syria . The Nabatean control over trade further increased and spread in many directions . 
 The replacement of Greece by the Roman empire as the administrator of the Mediterranean basin led to the resumption of direct trade with the East and the elimination of the taxes extracted previously by the middlemen of the south . According to Milo Kearney ( 2003 ) " The South Arabs in protest took to pirate attacks over the Roman ships in the Gulf of Aden . In response , the Romans destroyed Aden and favored the Western Abyssinian coast of the Red Sea . " Indian ships sailed to Egypt as the maritime routes of Southern Asia were not under the control of a single power .

 Some similarities between the Mesoamerican and the Andean cultures suggest that the two regions became a part of a wider world system , as a result of trade , by the 1st millennium BCE . The current academic view is that the flow of goods across the Andean slopes was controlled by institutions distributing locations to local groups , who were then free to access them for trading . This trade across the Andean slopes — described sometimes as " vertical trade " — may have overshadowed the long distance trade between the people of the Andes and the neighboring forests . The <unk> herbalists traded in tropical plants between 6th and the 10th centuries , while copper was dealt by specialized merchants in the Peruvian valley of Chincha . Long distance trade may have seen local elites resorting to struggle in order for manipulation and control . 
 Prior to the Inca dominance , specialized long distance merchants provided the highlanders with goods such as gold nuggets , copper hatchets , cocoa , salt etc. for redistribution among the locals , and were key players in the politics of the region . Hatchet shaped copper currency was produced by the Peruvian people , in order to obtain valuables from pre Columbian Ecuador . A maritime exchange system stretched from the west coast of Mexico to southernmost Peru , trading mostly in Spondylus , which represented rain and fertility and was considered the principal food of the gods by the people of the Inca empire . Spondylus was used in elite rituals , and the effective redistribution of it had political effect in the Andes during the pre @-@ Hispanic times .

 The Silk road was one of the first trade routes to join the Eastern and the Western worlds . According to <unk> <unk> ( 2000 ) : 
 " Along the Silk Roads , technology traveled , ideas were exchanged , and friendship and understanding between East and West were experienced for the first time on a large scale . Easterners were exposed to Western ideas and life @-@ styles , and Westerners too , learned about Eastern culture and its spirituality @-@ oriented cosmology . Buddhism as an Eastern religion received international attention through the Silk Roads . " 
 Cultural interactions patronized often by powerful emperors , such as Kanishka , led to development of art due to introduction of a rich variety of influences . Buddhist missions thrived along the Silk Roads , partly due to the conducive intermixing of trade and cultural values , which created a series of safe stoppages for both the pilgrims and the traders . Among the frequented routes of the Silk Route was the Burmese route extending from <unk> , which served as a path for Marco Polo 's visit to Yunnan and Indian Buddhist missions to Canton in order to establish Buddhist monasteries . This route - often under the presence of hostile tribes - also finds mention in the works of Rashid @-@ al @-@ Din Hamadani . 
 = = = = Grand Trunk Road = = = = 
 The Grand Trunk Road - connecting Chittagong in Bangladesh to Peshawar in Pakistan - has existed for over two and a half millennia . One of the important trade routes of the world , this road has been a strategic artery with fortresses , halting posts , wells , post offices , milestones and other facilities . Part of this road through Pakistan also coincided with the Silk Road . 
 This highway has been associated with emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Sher Shah Suri , the latter became synonymous with this route due to his role in ensuring the safety of the travelers and the upkeep of the road . Emperor Sher Shah widened and realigned the road to other routes , and provided approximately 1700 roadside inns through his empire . These inns provided free food and lodgings to the travelers regardless of their status . 
 The British occupation of this road was of special significance for the British Raj in India . Bridges , pathways and newer inns were constructed by the British for the first thirty @-@ seven years of their reign since the occupation of Punjab in 1849 . The British followed roughly the same alignment as the old routes , and at some places the newer routes ran parallel to the older routes . 
 <unk> <unk> ( 2000 ) comments on the Grand Trunk Road : 
 " Along this road marched not only the mighty armies of conquerors , but also the caravans of traders , scholars , artists , and common folk . Together with people , moved ideas , languages , customs , and cultures , not just in one , but in both directions . At different meeting places - permanent as well as temporary - people of different origins and from different cultural backgrounds , professing different faiths and creeds , eating different foods , wearing different clothes , and speaking different languages and dialects would meet one another peacefully . They would understand one another 's food , dress , manner , and etiquette , and even borrow words , phrases , idioms and , at times , whole languages from others . " 
 = = = = Amber Road = = = = 
 The Amber Road was a European trade route associated with the trade and transport of amber . Amber satisfied the criteria for long distance trade as it was light in weight and was in high demand for ornamental purposes around the Mediterranean . Before the establishment of Roman control over areas such as Pannonia , the Amber Road was virtually the only route available for long distance trade . 
 Towns along the Amber Road began to rise steadily during the 1st century CE , despite the troop movements under Titus Flavius Vespasianus and his son Titus Flavius Domitianus . Under the reign of Tiberius Caesar Augustus , the Amber Road was straightened and paved according to the prevailing urban standards . Roman towns began to appear along the road , initially founded near the site of Celtic oppida . 
 The 3rd century saw the Danube river become the principal artery of trade , eclipsing the Amber Road and other commercial routes . The redirection of investment to the Danubian forts saw the towns along the Amber Road growing slowly , though yet retaining their prosperity . The prolonged struggle between the Romans and the barbarians further left its mark on the towns along the Amber Road . 
 = = = = Via Maris = = = = 
 Via Maris , literally Latin for " the way of the sea , " was an ancient highway used by the Romans and the Crusaders . The states controlling the Via Maris were in a position to grant access for trade to their own citizens and collect tolls from the outsiders to maintain the trade route . The name Via Maris is a Latin translation of a Hebrew phrase related to Isaiah . Due to the biblical significance of this ancient route , many attempts to find its present @-@ day location have been made by Christian pilgrims . 13th @-@ century traveler and pilgrim Burchard of Mount Zion refers to the Via Maris route as a way leading along the shore of the Sea of Galilee .

 Early Muslim writings confirm that the people of West Africa operated a sophisticated network of trade , usually under the authority of a monarch who levied taxes and provided bureaucratic and military support to his kingdom . Sophisticated mechanisms for the economic and political development of the involved African areas were in place before Islam further strengthened trade , towns and government in western Africa . The capital , court and trade of the region find mention in the works of scholar Abū ' Ubayd ' Abd Allāh al @-@ <unk> ; the mainstay of the trans Saharan trade was gold and salt . 
 The powerful Saharan tribes , Berber in origin and later adapting to Muslim and Arab cultures , controlled the channels to western Africa by making efficient use of horse @-@ drawn vehicles and pack animals . The <unk> engaged in a struggle against the Sa 'di dynasty of Morocco over the control of the trans Saharan trade , resulting in damage on both sides and a weak Moroccan victory , further strengthening the uninvolved Saharan tribes . Struggles and disturbances continued till the 14th century , by which the Mandé merchants were trading with the Hausa , between Lake Chad and the Niger . Newer trade routes developed following extension of trade .

 The Ptolemaic dynasty had initiated Greco @-@ Roman maritime trade contact with India using the Red Sea ports .

By the time of Augustus up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from <unk> <unk> to India , trading in a diverse variety of goods . Arsinoe , Berenice <unk> and <unk> <unk> were the principal Roman ports involved in this maritime trading network , while the Indian ports included Barbaricum , <unk> , Muziris and Arikamedu . 
 The Indians were present in Alexandria and the Christian and Jewish settlers from Rome continued to live in India long after the fall of the Roman empire , which resulted in Rome 's loss of the Red Sea ports , previously used to secure trade with India by the Greco @-@ Roman world since the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty . 
 = = = = Hanseatic trade = = = = 
 Shortly before the 12th century the Germans played a relatively modest role in the north European trade . However , this was to change with the development of Hanseatic trade , as a result of which German traders became prominent in the Baltic and the North Sea regions . Following the death of Eric VI of Denmark , German forces attacked and sacked Denmark , bringing with them artisans and merchants under the new administration which controlled the Hansa regions . During the third quarter of the 14th century the Hanseatic trade faced two major difficulties : economic conflict with the Flanders and hostilities with Denmark . These events led to the formation of an organized association of Hanseatic towns , which replaced the earlier union of German merchants . This new Hansa of the towns , aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade , was prominent for the next hundred and fifty years . 
 Philippe <unk> associates the downfall of the Hansa to a new alliance between Lübeck , Hamburg and Bremen , which <unk> the older institution . He further sets the date of dissolution of the Hansa at 1630 and concludes that the Hansa was almost entirely forgotten by the end of the 18th century . Scholar Georg Friedrich Sartorius published the first monograph regarding the community in the early years of the 19th century .

 The trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks ( Russian : <unk> " <unk> <unk> в <unk> " , Put iz <unk> v <unk> , Swedish : <unk> från <unk> till <unk> , Greek : <unk> <unk> <unk> - Ελλήνων ) was a trade route that connected Scandinavia , Kievan Rus ' and the Byzantine Empire . The route allowed traders along the route to establish a direct prosperous trade with Byzantium , and prompted some of them to settle in the territories of present @-@ day Belarus , Russia and Ukraine . 
 The route began in Scandinavian trading centres such as Birka , Hedeby , and Gotland , crossed the Baltic Sea entered the Gulf of Finland , followed the Neva River into the Lake Ladoga . Then it followed the Volkhov River , upstream past the towns of Staraya Ladoga and Velikiy Novgorod , crossed Lake Ilmen , and up the Lovat River . From there , ships had to be portaged to the Dnieper River near <unk> . A second route from the Baltic to the Dnieper was along the Western Dvina ( Daugava ) between the Lovat and the Dnieper in the Smolensk region , and along the <unk> River to <unk> . Along the Dnieper , the route crossed several major rapids and passed through Kiev , and after entering the Black Sea followed its west coast to Constantinople . 
 = = = = Maritime republics ' Mediterranean trade = = = = 
 The economic growth of Europe around the year 1000 , together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes , eased the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the Mediterranean . The growing independence of some coastal cities gave them a leading role in this commerce : Maritime Republics ( Italian " <unk> <unk> " ) of Venice , Genoa , Amalfi , Pisa and Republic of Ragusa developed their own " empires " in the Mediterranean shores . From the 8th until the 15th century , they held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East . The silk and spice trade , involving spices , incense , herbs , drugs and opium , made these Mediterranean city @-@ states phenomenally rich . Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages . They were all imported from Asia and Africa . Muslim traders — mainly descendants of Arab sailors from Yemen and Oman — dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean , tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading <unk> in India , westward to <unk> in Persian Gulf and Jeddah in the Red Sea . From there , overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts . Venetian merchants distributed then the goods through Europe until the rise of the Ottoman Empire , that eventually led to the fall of Constantinople in 1453 , barring Europeans from important combined @-@ land @-@ sea routes . 
 = = = = Spice Route = = = = 
 As trade between India and the Greco @-@ Roman world increased spices became the main import from India to the Western world , bypassing silk and other commodities . The Indian commercial connection with South East Asia proved vital to the merchants of Arabia and Persia during the 7th and 8th centuries . 
 The Abbasids used Alexandria , Damietta , Aden and Siraf as entry ports to India and China . Merchants arriving from India in the port city of Aden paid tribute in form of musk , camphor , ambergris and sandalwood to Ibn Ziyad , the sultan of Yemen . Moluccan products shipped across the ports of Arabia to the Near East passed through the ports of India and Sri Lanka . Indian exports of spices find mention in the works of Ibn <unk> ( 850 CE ) , al @-@ <unk> ( 1150 ) , Ishak bin <unk> ( 907 ) and Al <unk> ( 14th century ) . After reaching either the Indian or the Sri Lankan ports , spices were sometimes shipped to East Africa , where they were used for many purposes , including burial rites . 
 On the orders of Manuel I of Portugal , four vessels under the command of navigator Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope , continuing to the eastern coast of Africa to Malindi to sail across the Indian Ocean to Calicut . The wealth of the Indies was now open for the Europeans to explore ; the Portuguese Empire was one of the early European empires to grow from spice trade . 
 = = Modern routes = = 
 The modern times saw development of newer means of transport and often controversial free trade agreements , which altered the political and logistical approach prevalent during the Middle Ages . Newer means of transport led to the establishment of new routes , and countries opened up borders to allow trade in mutually agreed goods as per the prevailing free trade agreement . Some old trading route were reopened during the modern times , although in different political and logistical scenarios . The entry of harmful foreign pollutants by the way of trade routes has been a cause of alarm during the modern times . A conservative estimate stresses that future damages from harmful animal and plant diseases may be as high as 134 billion US dollars in the absence of effective measures to prevent the introduction of unwanted pests through various trade routes .

 Networks , like the Santa Fe Trail and the Oregon Trail , became prominent in the United States with wagon trains gaining popularity as a mode of long distance overland transportation for both people and goods . The Oregon @-@ California routes were highly organized with planned rendezvous locations and essential supplies . The settlers in the United States used these wagon trains - sometimes made up of 100 of more Conestoga wagons - for westward emigration during the 18th and the 19th centuries . Among the challenges faced by the wagon route operators were crossing rivers , mountains and hostile Native Americans . Preparations were also made according to the weather and protection of trade and travelers was ensured by a few guards on horseback . Wagon freighting was also essential to American growth until it was replaced by the railroad and the truck . 
 = = = Railway routes = = = 
 The 1844 Railway act of England compelled at least one train to a station every day with the third class fares priced at a penny a mile . Trade benefited as the workers and the lower classes had the ability to travel to other towns frequently . Suburban communities began to develop and towns began to spread outwards . The British constructed a vast railway network in India , but it was considered to serve a strategic purpose in addition to the commercial purpose . The efficient use of rail routes helped in the unification of the United States of America . 
 The modern times saw nations struggle for the control of rail routes : The Trans @-@ Siberian Railway was intended to be used by the Russian government for control of Manchuria and later China ; the German forces wanted to establish Berlin @-@ Baghdad Railway in order to influence the Near East ; and the Austrian government planned a route from Vienna to Salonika for control of the Balkans . According to the Encyclopædia Britannica ( 2002 ) : 
 Railroads reached their maturity in the early 20th century , as trains carried the bulk of land freight and passenger traffic in the industrialized countries of the world . By the mid @-@ 20th century , however , they had lost their preeminent position . The private automobile had replaced the railroad for short passenger trips , while the airplane had usurped it for long @-@ distance travel , especially in the United States . Railroads remained effective , however , for transporting people in high @-@ volume situations , such as commuting between the centres of large cities and their suburbs , and medium @-@ distance travel of less than about 300 miles between urban centres . 
 Although railroads have lost much of the general @-@ freight @-@ carrying business to semi @-@ trailer trucks , they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such bulk commodities as coal , grain , chemicals , and ore over long distances . The development of containerization has made the railroads more effective in handling finished merchandise at relatively high speeds . In addition , the introduction of piggyback flatcars , in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially @-@ designed cars , has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking .

 The advent motor vehicles created a demand for better use of highways . Roads evolved into two way roads , expressways , freeways and tollways during the modern times . Existing roads were developed and highways were designed according to intended use . 
 Trucks came into widespread use in the Western World during World War I , and quickly gained reputation as a means of long distance transportation of goods . Modern highways , such as the Trans @-@ Canada Highway , Highway 1 ( Australia ) and Pan @-@ American Highway allowed transport of goods and services across great distances . Automobiles continue to play a crucial role in the economies of the Industrialized countries , resulting in rise of businesses such as motor freight operation and truck transportation . 
 The emission rate for cars using highways has been on a decline between 1975 and 1995 due to regulations and the introduction of unleaded petrol . This trend is especially notable since there has been a growth in vehicles and vehicle miles traveled by automobiles using these highways .

 A consistent shift from land based trade to sea based trade has been recorded since the last three millennia . The strategic advantages of port cities as trading centers are many : they are both less dependent on vital connections and less vulnerable to blockages . Oceanic ports can help forge trading relationships with other parts of the world easily . 
 Modern maritime trade routes - sometimes in the form of artificial canals like the Suez Canal - had visible impact on the economic and political standing of nations . The opening of the Suez Canal altered British interactions with the colonies of the British Empire as the dynamics of transportation , trade and communication had now changed drastically . Other waterways , like the Panama Canal played an important role in the histories of many nations . Inland water transportation remained significantly important even as the advent of railroads and automobiles resulted in a steady decline of canals . Inland water transport is still used for the transportation of bulk commodities e.g. grains , coal , and ore . 
 Waterway commerce was historically important to Europe , particularly to Russia . According to the Encyclopædia Britannica ( 2002 ) : " Russia has been a significant beneficiary . Not only have inland waterways opened vast areas of its interior to development , but Moscow @-@ linked to the White , Baltic , Black , Caspian , and Azov seas by canals and rivers @-@ has become a major inland port .

 Historically , many governments followed a policy of protection of trade . International free trade became visible in 1860 with the Anglo @-@ French commercial treaty , and the trend gained further momentum during the period after World War II . According to The Columbia Encyclopedia , Sixth Edition : 
 " After World War II , strong sentiment developed throughout the world against protection and high tariffs and in favor of freer trade . The results were new organizations and agreements on international trade such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( 1948 ) , the Benelux Economic Union ( 1948 ) , the European Economic Community ( Common Market , 1957 ) , the European Free Trade Association ( 1959 ) , Mercosur ( the Southern Cone Common Market , 1991 ) , and the World Trade Organization ( 1995 ) . In 1993 , the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) was approved by the governments of Canada , Mexico , and the United States . In the early 1990s , the nations of the European Union ( the successor organization to the Common Market ) undertook to remove all barriers to the free movement of trade and employment across their mutual borders . " 
 In May 2004 the United States of America signed the American Free trade Agreement with five Central American nations . 
 = = = Air routes = = = 
 Air transport has become an indispensable part of modern society . People have come to use air transport both for long and middle distances , with the average route length of long distances being 720 kilometers in Europe and 1220 kilometers in the US . This industry annually carries 1600 million passengers worldwide , covers a 15 million kilometer network , and has an annual turnover of 260 billion dollars . 
 This mode of transportation links national , international and global economies , making it vital to many other industries . Newer trends of liberalization of trade have fostered routes among nations bound by agreements . One such example , the American Open Skies policy , led to greater openness in many international markets , but some international restrictions have survived even during the present times . 
 Express delivery through international cargo airlines touched US $ 20 billion in 1998 and , according to the World Trade Organization , is expected to triple in 2015 . In 1998 , 50 pure cargo @-@ service companies operated internationally . 
 Air transport particularly favors light , expensive and small products : electronic media rather than books , for example , and refined drugs rather than bulk food .

 The economic importance of pipeline transport - responsible for a high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation - is often undermined by the general public due to the lack of visibility of this mode .

 A Child of Our Time is a secular oratorio by the British composer Michael Tippett ( 1905 – 98 ) , who also wrote the libretto . Composed between 1939 and 1941 , it was first performed at the Adelphi Theatre , London , on 19 March 1944 . The work was inspired by events that affected Tippett profoundly : the assassination in 1938 of a German diplomat by a young Jewish refugee , and the Nazi government 's reaction in the form of a violent pogrom against its Jewish population — called Kristallnacht . Tippett 's oratorio deals with these incidents in the context of the experiences of oppressed people generally , and carries a strongly pacifist message of ultimate understanding and reconciliation . The text 's recurrent themes of shadow and light reflect the Jungian psychoanalysis which Tippett underwent in the years immediately before writing the work . 
 The oratorio uses a traditional three @-@ part format based on that of Handel 's Messiah , and is structured in the manner of Bach 's Passions . The work 's most original feature is Tippett 's use of American spirituals , which carry out the role allocated by Bach to chorales . Tippett justified this innovation on the grounds that these songs of oppression possess a universality absent from traditional hymns . A Child of Our Time was well received on its first performance , and has since been performed all over the world in many languages . A number of recorded versions are available , including one conducted by Tippett when he was 86 years old . 
 = = Background and conception = = 
 Michael Tippett was born in London in 1905 , to well @-@ to @-@ do though unconventional parents . His father , a lawyer and businessman , was a freethinker , his mother a writer and suffragette . He received piano lessons as a child , but first showed his musical prowess while a pupil at Stamford School in Lincolnshire , between 1920 and 1922 . Although the school 's formal music curriculum was slight , Tippett received private piano tuition from Frances Tinkler , a noted local teacher whose most distinguished pupil had been Malcolm Sargent , himself a former pupil at Stamford . Tippett 's chance purchase in a local bookshop of Stanford 's book Musical Composition led to his determination to be a composer , and in April 1923 he was accepted as a student at the Royal College of Music ( RCM ) . Here he studied composition , first under Charles Wood ( who died in 1926 ) and later , less successfully , with Charles Kitson . He also studied conducting , first under Sargent and later under Adrian Boult . He left the RCM in December 1928 , but after two years spent unsuccessfully attempting to launch his career as a composer , he returned to the college in 1930 for a further period of study , principally under the professor of counterpoint , R. O. Morris . 
 In the economically depressed 1930s Tippett adopted a strongly left @-@ wing political stance , and became increasingly involved with the unemployed , both through his participation in the North Yorkshire work camps , and as founder of the South London Orchestra made up of out @-@ of @-@ work musicians . He was briefly a member of the British Communist Party in 1935 , but his sympathies were essentially Trotskyist , inimical to the Stalinist orientation of his local party , and he soon left . In 1935 he embraced pacifism , but by this time he was becoming overtaken by a range of emotional problems and uncertainties , largely triggered by the break @-@ up of an intense relationship with the painter Wilfred Franks . In addition to these personal difficulties he became anxious that the political situation in Europe was leading inexorably towards war . After meeting the Jungian psychoanalyst John Layard , Tippett underwent a period of therapy which included self @-@ analysis of his dreams . According to Tippett 's biographer Geraint Lewis , the outcome of this process was a " rebirth , confirming for Tippett the nature of his homosexuality while ... strengthening his destiny as a creative artist at the possible expense of personal relationships " . The encounter with Layard led Tippett to a lifelong interest in the work and teaching of Carl Jung , an influence carried through into many of his subsequent compositions . 
 In the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1930s several of Tippett 's early works were published , including his String Quartet No. 1 , Sonata No. 1 for piano , and Concerto for Double String Orchestra . Among his unpublished output in these years were two works for voice : the ballad @-@ opera Robin Hood , written for performance at the Yorkshire work camps , and A Song of Liberty based on William Blake 's " The Marriage of Heaven and Hell " . As his self @-@ confidence increased , Tippett felt increasingly driven to write a work of overt political protest . In his search for a subject he first considered the Dublin Easter Rising of 1916 : he may have been aware that Benjamin Britten had written incidental music to Montagu Slater 's play Easter 1916 . However , events towards the end of 1938 turned his attention away from Irish matters . Tippett had made several visits to Germany , and had acquired a love for its literature and culture . He became increasingly distressed by reports of events in that country and , in particular the persecution of its Jewish population . In November 1938 the assassination in Paris of a German diplomat , Ernst vom Rath , by Herschel Grynszpan , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Jewish refugee , precipitated the " Kristallnacht " pogrom across Germany . Over several days of violence synagogues were burned , Jewish homes and businesses attacked and destroyed , thousands of Jews were arrested , and some Jews were stoned or beaten to death . Reports from Germany of these events affected Tippett profoundly , and became the inspiration for his first large @-@ scale dramatic work .

 = = = Libretto = = = 
 Having found his subject , Tippett sought advice on the preparation of the text from T. S. Eliot , whom he had met recently through a mutual friend , Francis Morley . The musicologist Michael Steinberg comments that , given his anti @-@ Semitism , Eliot may have been an inappropriate choice of collaborator , though Tippett considered the poet his spiritual and artistic mentor , and felt that his counsel would be crucial . Tippett writes : " I plucked up courage and asked him if he would write it . Eliot said he would consider the matter as long as I provided him with a precise scheme of musical sections and an exact indication of the numbers and kinds of words for each stage " . When Tippett produced his detailed draft , Eliot advised the composer to write his own libretto , suggesting that his own superior poetry would either distract attention from the music , or otherwise would be " swallowed up by it " . Either way , there would be a mismatch . Tippett accepted this advice ; henceforth , he records , he always wrote his own texts . 
 Tippett resolved that his work would be an oratorio rather than an opera . He chose the title from Ein Kind unserer Zeit , a contemporary protest novel by the Austro @-@ Hungarian writer , Ödön von Horváth . The text that Tippett prepared follows the three @-@ part structure used in Handel 's Messiah , in which Part I is prophetic and preparatory , Part II narrative and epic , Part III meditative and metaphysical . In A Child of Our Time the general condition of oppression is defined in the first part , the narrative elements are confined to the second part , while the third part contains interpretation and reflection on a possible healing . Tippett perceived the work as a general depiction of man 's inhumanity to man , and wanted Grynszpan 's tragedy to stand for the oppressed everywhere . To preserve the universality of the work , Tippett avoids all use of proper names for people and places : thus , Paris is " a great city " , Grynszpan becomes " the boy " , the soprano is " the boy 's mother " , vom Rath is " the official " . 
 Commentators have identified numerous works as textual influences , including Eliot 's Murder in the Cathedral and Ash Wednesday , Goethe 's Faust and Wilfred Owen 's poem " The Seed " . Tippett 's biographer Ian Kemp equates the ending of the oratorio to the closing pages of Part I of John Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress , in which Christian and Hopeful end their journey by crossing a deep and wide river to reach their heavenly home . The influence of Jungian themes is evident in the recurrent images of darkness and light , and the recognition and balancing of opposites . In a recent analysis of the work , Richard Rodda finds A Child of Our Time " rooted in the essential dialectic of human life that Tippett so prized in Jung 's philosophy — winter / spring , darkness / light , evil / good , reason / pity , dreams / reality , loneliness / fellowship , the man of destiny / the child of our time ... " 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 Tippett completed his Jungian psychoanalysis on 31 August 1939 . Three days later , on the day that Britain declared war on Germany , he began composing A Child of Our Time . His grounding in the traditions of European music guided him instinctively towards the Passions of Bach as his basic musical model . Thus the building blocks of the work are familiar : recitatives , arias , choruses and ensembles , with a male soloist acting as a narrator and the chorus as full participants in the action . Tippett also introduced two other formal number types : the operatic scena and the orchestral interlude , the latter allowing time for reflection on significant events . Tippett wished to punctuate his work with an equivalent to the congregation chorales which recur in Bach 's Passions ; however , he wanted his work to speak to atheists , agnostics and Jews as well as to Christians . He considered briefly whether folk @-@ songs , or even Jewish hymns , could provide an alternative , but rejected these because he felt that , like the chorales , they lacked universality . A solution was suggested to him when he heard on the radio a rendering of the spiritual " Steal away " . In particular he was struck by the power of the words " The trumpet sounds within @-@ a my soul " . This led him to recognise spirituals as carrying an emotional significance far beyond their origin as slave songs in 19th @-@ century America and as representing the oppressed everywhere . 
 Having found his substitute for the chorales , Tippett wrote off to America for a collection of spirituals . When this arrived , " I saw that there was one for every key situation in the oratorio " . He chose five : " Steal Away " ; " Nobody Knows the Trouble I See , Lord " ; " Go Down , Moses " ; " O , By and By " ; and " Deep River " . The first , fourth and fifth of these are placed at the ends of the oratorio 's three parts , " Deep River " as the finale expressing , according to Tippett , the hope of a fresh spring after a long , dark winter . Kenneth Gloag , in his detailed analysis of the oratorio , writes : " As well as constructing the pathway through the dramatic narrative , the five spirituals also combine to provide moments of focus and repose ... giving shape to both the musical and literary dimensions of the work " . Tippett felt that the work encapsulated all his current political , moral and psychological preoccupations . 
 = = Synopsis and structure = = 
 According to Tippett 's description , " Part I of the work deals with the general state of oppression in our time . Part II presents the particular story of a young man 's attempt to seek justice by violence and the catastrophic consequences ; and Part III considers the moral to be drawn , if any . " He later extended his summary to the following : 
 Part I : The general state of affairs in the world today as it affects all individuals , minorities , classes or races that are felt to be outside the ruling conventions . Man at odds with his Shadow ( i.e. the dark side of personality ) . 
 Part II : The " Child of Our Time " appears , enmeshed in the drama of his personal fate and the elemental social forces of our day . The drama is because the forces which drive the young man prove stronger than the good advice of his uncle and aunt , as it always was and always will be . 
 Part III : The significance of this drama and the possible healing that would come from Man 's acceptance of his Shadow in relation to his Light . 
 = = Conscientious objector = = 
 After the outbreak of war in September 1939 , Tippett joined the Peace Pledge Union — with which he had been informally associated since 1935 — and applied for registration as a conscientious objector , although his case was not considered by the tribunal until February 1942 . In October 1940 he became director of music at Morley College , where the previous April he had conducted the South London Orchestra in the premiere of his Concerto for Double String Orchestra . After completing the composition of A Child of Our Time in 1941 , Tippett worked on other projects , feeling that the oratorio 's pacifist message was out of touch with the prevailing national mood . Walter Goehr , who conducted the Morley College orchestra , advised delaying its first performance until a more propitious time . In February 1942 Tippett was assigned by the tribunal to non @-@ combative military duties . Following his appeal , this was changed to service either with Air Raid Precautions ( ARP ) , with the fire service or on the land . He felt obliged to refuse these directions , and as a result was sentenced in June 1943 to three months ' imprisonment , of which he served two months before his early release for good behaviour .

 After his release from prison in August 1943 , with encouragement from Britten and the youthful music critic John Amis , Tippett began to make arrangements for the oratorio 's first performance . Goehr agreed to conduct , but overrode the composer 's initial view that Morley College 's orchestra could handle the work and insisted that professionals were needed . Tippett records that " somehow or other the money was scraped together to engage the London Philharmonic Orchestra " . Morley College Choir 's choral forces were augmented by the London Regional Civil Defence Choir . Britten 's connection with Sadler 's Wells Opera brought three soloists to the project : Joan Cross ( soprano ) , Peter Pears ( tenor ) , and Roderick Lloyd ( bass ) . The fourth singer , Margaret MacArthur ( alto ) , came from Morley College . The premiere was arranged for 19 March 1944 , at London 's Adelphi Theatre . Before this event Amis introduced the work in an article for the February 1944 issue of The Musical Times , in which he predicted a noteworthy musical occasion : " The general style of the oratorio is simple and direct , and the music will , I think , have an immediate effect on both audience and performers " . 
 Later writers would state that A Child of Our Time placed Tippett in the first rank of the composers of his generation , and most of the early reviews were favourable . Among these , The Times 's critic called the work " strikingly original in conception and execution " , and wrote that Tippett had succeeded quite remarkably in writing an effective tract for the times . A second Times review , written a few days after the premiere , suggested that the oratorio had articulated a key contemporary question : " How is the conflict of the inevitable with the intolerable to be resolved ? " It pointed to the hope expressed in the final spiritual , " Deep River " , and concluded that despite some weak passages the work created a successful partnership between art and philosophy . William Glock in The Observer was laudatory : " The most moving and important work by an English composer for many years " . Glock found that the spirituals suited the themes of the oratorio perfectly , and had been arranged " with a profound sense of beauty " . 
 In The Musical Times Edwin Evans praised Tippett 's text : " simple and direct ... he has wisely resisted any temptation to use quasi @-@ biblical or ' Pilgrim 's Progress ' language . " Evans was uncertain whether the music was truly reflective of the words : " ... the emotion seemed singularly cool under the provocations described in the text " . Unlike Glock , Evans was unconvinced by the case for the inclusion of the spirituals : " [ T ] he peculiar poignancy they have in their traditional form tends to evaporate in their new environment " . Eric Blom , in Music & Letters , thought the idea of using spirituals " brilliant " , and the analogy with Bach 's chorales convincing . Blom was less enthusiastic about the text , which he found " very terse and bald – rather poor , really " — though he thought this preferable to the pomposities such as those that characterise libretti written for Handel . In his autobiography , Tippett makes only muted references to the premiere , noting that the event " had some mixed reviews " , but in a letter to his friend Francesca Allinson he professed himself delighted with the breadth of response to the work : " It 's got over not only to the ordinary listeners but even to the intellectuals like [ Mátyás ] Seiber , who has written to me of some of the ' lovely texture of some of the numbers ' " . 
 = = = Early performances = = = 
 The generally positive reception of the premiere persuaded Arthur Bliss , then serving as the BBC 's director of music , to arrange a broadcast performance of the work . This took place on 10 January 1945 shortly after which , in February , Tippett conducted the work at the Royal Albert Hall . The radio broadcast had been heard by Howard Hartog , a music writer and publisher who just after the war was in Occupied Germany , attempting to re @-@ establish the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra in Hamburg . As part of this endeavour he decided to mount a performance of A Child of Our Time , with Hans Schmidt @-@ <unk> conducting . Because of his pacifism and record as a conscientious objector , Tippett was not allowed into the occupied zone and thus missed the performance . However , in 1947 he was able to travel to Budapest where his friend , the Hungarian composer Mátyás Seiber , had organised a performance by Hungarian Radio . The local singers ' problems with the English text meant that the work was sung in Hungarian , which Tippett , who conducted , described as " a very odd experience " . 
 In the early 1950s Tippett attended a performance of the oratorio at the Radio Hall in Brussels , after which members of the audience expressed to him their gratitude for the work which , they said , exactly represented their wartime experiences . In December 1952 he travelled to Turin for a radio performance , conducted by Herbert von Karajan and with operatic stars Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Nicolai Gedda among the soloists . He records that during the rehearsals the bass soloist , Mario Petri , had problems singing his recitatives , and that despite some coaching from the composer , was still " at sea " during the performance . Karajan asked Tippett if he would object to an extra interval in Part II , to which Tippett replied that he would mind very much . Karajan nevertheless imposed the break , thus presenting a four @-@ part version of the work . 
 = = = Wider audience = = = 
 In May 1962 A Child of Our Time received its Israel premiere in Tel Aviv . Tippett says that this performance was delayed because for a while there were local objections to the word " Jesus " in the text . When it came about , among the audience was Herschel Grynszpan 's father who , Tippett wrote , was " manifestly touched by the work his son 's precipitate action 25 years earlier had inspired . " The performance , by the Kol Yisrael Orchestra with the Tel Aviv Chamber Choir , was acclaimed by the audience of 3000 , but received mixed reviews from the press . The Times report noted contrasting opinions from two leading Israeli newspapers . The correspondent for Haaretz had expressed disappointment : " Every tone is unoriginal , and the work repeats old effects in a most conventional manner " . Conversely , according to the Times report , <unk> 's critic had " found that the composition had moved everyone to the depths of his soul ... no Jewish composer had ever written anything so sublime on the theme of the Holocaust . " 
 Despite its successes in Europe A Child of Our Time did not reach the United States until 1965 , when it was performed during the Aspen Music Festival , with the composer present . In his memoirs Tippett mentions another performance on that American tour , at a women 's college in Baltimore , in which the male chorus and soloists were black Catholic ordinands from a local seminary . The first significant American presentations of the work came a decade later : at Cleveland in 1977 where Prince Charles , who was visiting , delayed his departure so that he could attend , and at Carnegie Hall , New York , where Colin Davis conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus . Reviewing this performance for The New York Times , Donal Henahan was unconvinced that the work 's " sincerity and unimpeachable intentions add [ ed ] up to important music " . The spirituals were sung with passion and fervour , but the rest was " reminiscent of a familiar pious sermon " in which the words were only intermittently intelligible . Meanwhile , the work had achieved its African debut , where in 1975 Tippett observed a performance with an improvised orchestra which incorporated the Zambian Police Band . The Zambian president , Kenneth Kaunda , was present , and entertained the composer afterwards .

 In October 1999 , in the year following Tippett 's death , A Child of Our Time received a belated New York Philharmonic premiere , at the Avery Fisher Hall . The New York Times reviewer , Paul Griffiths , expressed some astonishment that this was the orchestra 's first attempt at the work . As part of the celebrations for the centenary of the composer 's birth in January 2005 , English National Opera staged a dramatised performance of the work , directed by Jonathan Kent — coincidentally , the first performance fell in the week of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps at Auschwitz . Anna Picard , writing in The Independent , recognised the work 's sincerity but found the dramatisation of its pacifist message wholly inappropriate : " Do we really need to see a dozen well @-@ fed actors and singers stripped and led into a smoking pit in order to understand the Holocaust ? " Anthony Holden in The Observer was more positive , commenting that " If you must stage a work intended for concert performance ... it is hard to imagine a more effective version than Kent 's , shot through with heavy symbolism of which Tippett would surely have approved . " Nevertheless , Holden found the overall result " super @-@ solemn , lurching between the over @-@ <unk> and the portentous " . The 2005 Holocaust Days of Remembrance ( 1 – 8 May ) were marked at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC by a special performance of A Child of Our time , in which the Washington Chorus was directed by Robert Shafer . The piece was performed at the BBC Proms 2016 on 23rd July by the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales . 
 A Child of Our Time has survived periods of indifference , particularly in America , to be ranked alongside Britten 's War Requiem as one of the most frequently performed large @-@ scale choral works of the post @-@ Second World War period . According to Meirion Bowen , Tippett 's long @-@ time companion and a champion of his music , the work 's particular quality is its universal message , with which audiences all over the world have identified . In his notes accompanying the performance at the 2010 Grant Park Music Festival in Chicago , Richard E. Rodda summarises the work 's continuing appeal : " [ I ] t deals with issues as timeless as civilization itself — man 's inhumanity to man , the place of the individual who confronts ruthless power ... the need for learning the lessons of history and for compassion and understanding and honesty and equality in our dealings with each other , whatever our differences may be . Tippett 's Child still speaks profoundly to us in our own deeply troubled time " . 
 = = Music = = 
 Kemp describes Tippett 's central problem in composing A Child of Our Time as integrating the language of the spirituals with his own musical style . Tippett was , in Kemp 's view , entirely successful in this respect ; " O by and by " , he says , sounds as if it could almost have been composed by Tippett . To assist the process of integration the composer had obtained recordings of American singing groups , especially the Hall Johnson Choir , which provided him with a three @-@ part model for determining the relationships between solo voices and chorus in the spirituals : chorus , soloists , chorus . Tippett 's instructions in the score specify that " the spirituals should not be thought of as congregational hymns , but as integral parts of the Oratorio ; nor should they be sentimentalised but sung with a strong underlying beat and slightly ' swung ' " . 
 The brief orchestral prelude to Part I introduces the two contrasting moods which pervade the entire work . Kemp likens the opening " snarling trumpet triad " to " a descent into Hades " , but it is answered immediately by a gently mournful phrase in the strings . In general the eight numbers which comprise this first part each have , says Gloag , their own distinct texture and harmonic identity , often in a disjunctive relationship with each other , although the second and third numbers are connected by an orchestral " <unk> " . From among the diverse musical features Steinberg draws attention to rhythms in the chorus " When Shall The <unk> 's City Cease " that illustrate Tippett 's knowledge of and feel for the English madrigal . What Kemp describes as " one of the supreme moments in Tippett 's music " occurs towards the end of the Part , as the soprano 's aria melts into the spiritual " Steal away " : " a [ transition ] so poignant as to set off that instant shock of recognition that floods the eyes with emotion ... although the soprano continues to grieve in a floating melisma , the spiritual comes as a relief as well as a release " . 
 Because of its large number ( 17 ) of generally short components , Part II is the most diffuse of the three parts , texturally and harmonically . The narrative is driven largely by alternating choruses and comments from the Narrator , with two brief operatic <unk> in which the four soloists participate . Kemp finds in one of the choruses an allusion to " Sei <unk> " from Bach 's St John Passion , and hears traces of Elgar in the soprano 's solo " O my son ! " which begins the first scena . The narrative climax is reached with the " Spiritual of Anger " : " Go Down , Moses " , which Tippett arranges in the form of a chorale . This is followed by three short meditations from tenor , soprano and alto soloists , before a possible redemption is glimpsed in the spiritual which ends the Part , " O by and by " , with a soprano descant which Steinberg describes as " ecstatic " . Part III consists of only five numbers , each rather more extensive than most of those in the earlier sections of the oratorio . The Part has , on the whole , a greater unity than its predecessors . The musical and emotional climax to the whole work is the penultimate ensemble : " I Would Know my Shadow and my Light " . Kemp writes : " The whole work has been leading to this moment ... the ensemble flows into a rapturous wordless benediction [ before ] a modulation leads into ' Deep River ' " . In this final spiritual , for the first time the full vocal and instrumental resources are deployed . The oratorio ends quietly , on an extended pianissimo " Lord " . 
 The total vocal and instrumental resources required for the oratorio are a SATB chorus with soprano , alto , tenor and bass soloists , and an orchestra comprising two flutes , two oboes , English horn , two clarinets , two bassoons , contrabassoon , four horns , three trumpets , three trombones , timpani , cymbals and strings . According to the vocal score , the approximate duration of the work is 66 minutes .

 The first recording of A Child of Our Time was issued in 1958 , and remained the only available version for 17 years . Sir Colin Davis made the first of his three recordings of the work in 1975 . Tippett himself , at the age of 86 , conducted a recording of the work with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in 1991 . 
 = Tyldesley = 
 Tyldesley ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ) is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan in Greater Manchester , England . It is north of Chat Moss near the foothills of the West Pennine Moors , 7 @.@ 7 miles ( 12 @.@ 4 km ) east @-@ southeast of Wigan and 8 @.@ 9 miles ( 14 @.@ 3 km ) west @-@ northwest of Manchester . At the United Kingdom Census 2001 , Tyldesley including the outlying areas of Astley , Shakerley , Mosley Common and New Manchester , had a population of 34 @,@ 000 . In 2011 the Tyldesley ward of Wigan Council had a population of 14 @,@ 341 . 
 Historically in Lancashire , Tyldesley and its surroundings have provided evidence for the remains of a Roman road passing through the township on its ancient course between Coccium ( Wigan ) and Mamucium ( Manchester ) . Following the Anglo @-@ Saxon invasion of Britain , Tyldesley was part of the manor of Warrington , until the Norman conquest of England , when the settlement constituted a township called Tyldesley @-@ with @-@ Shakerley in the ancient parish of Leigh . 
 The factory system , and textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution , triggered a process of population growth and urbanisation such that by the early @-@ 20th century it was said that the newly emerged mill town was " eminently characteristic of an industrial district whose natural features have been almost entirely swept away to give place to factories , iron foundries , and collieries " . After industrial activity declined in the late @-@ 20th century , land reclamation and post @-@ war residential developments have altered the landscape and encouraged economic activity along Elliott Street — Tyldesley 's central commercial area and main thoroughfare .

 = = = Toponymy = = = 
 Tyldesley meaning " <unk> 's clearing " is derived from the Old English ( OE ) personal name <unk> ( or <unk> ) and <unk> a " wood , clearing " , suggesting what is now open land was once covered with forest . The name was recorded as <unk> in 1210 . Alternative spellings include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Tildesley . Tyldesley is situated at the edge of the Lancashire Plain north of Chat Moss and the Banks is a sandstone ridge where the foothills of the Pennines begin and gave the town its early name of <unk> Banks . The land rises from 100 feet ( 30 m ) at the foot of the banks to 250 feet ( 76 m ) at the highest point . Tyldesley is pronounced " Til @-@ <unk> " , and locally known as " Bongs " . In local pronunciation " Banks " was corrupted to " Bongs " . The old name for Mosley Common was the " Hurst " or " <unk> " , the suffix " <unk> " means a wooded hill ( OE ) .

 The remains of a Roman road serving camps at Coccium ( Wigan ) and Mamucium ( Manchester ) passed through the area . It ran from Keeper Delph in Boothstown crossing Mort Lane north west of Cleworth Hall and south of Shakerley Old Hall . The road continued towards the Valley at Atherton where coins have been found , and on towards Gibfield and Wigan . 
 In 1947 , two urns containing about 550 Roman bronze coins , minted between AD 259 and AD 278 , were found near the old Tyldesley – Worsley border . The coins are in the British Museum . After the end of Roman rule in Britain and into the history of Anglo @-@ Saxon England , nothing was written about Tyldesley . Evidence for the presence of Saxons is provided by place names incorporating the Old English suffix leah , such as Tyldesley , Shakerley , and Astley . 
 = = = Manor houses = = = 
 The manor house was Astley Hall which , in 1212 , was home to Hugh Tyldesley , Lord of the Manors of Astley and Tyldesley . It is just inside the Tyldesley boundary but has been associated with Astley since the death of Henry Tyldesley in 1301 , when the manor was divided among three sons . The Tyldesleys had a " reputation for lawlessness and who had frequent disputes with their neighbours " . One exception was Hugh Tyldesley , Hugh the Pious , who endowed Cockersand Abbey with land in Shakerley before his death in 1226 . The moated New Hall in the Park of Tyldesley , close to the old manor house was in existence before 1422 when it belonged to Thomas Tyldesley . 
 The new manor , known as the Garrett , was owned by John Tyldesley in 1505 . The timber @-@ framed Garrett Hall remained with the Tyldesleys until 1652 when Lambert Tyldesley died leaving no heir . The new owners , the Stanleys , leased it to tenant farmers . In 1732 it was sold to Thomas Clowes who also leased the property to tenants . In 1829 the estate was bought by the Bridgewater Trustees . 
 The township had several other significant houses . Generations of the Shakerley family lived in Shakerley Old Hall , close to the Shakerley Brook and Roman road . In medieval times they paid rent to Cockersand Abbey and dues of " one pair of white gloves at the feast of Easter " to Adam Tyldesley . Chaddock Hall was home to a family of yeomen farmers . Its name was variously recorded as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , the last syllable probably meaning " oak " . It was surrounded by a hamlet in the east of the township . The <unk> , like the Tyldesleys and <unk> , had a reputation for lawlessness . 
 The tenants of the Tyldesley , Shakerley and Chaddock lands were summoned for military service . Archers from Chaddock fought at Crécy in 1346 and at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 . In 1360 , William Chaddock was described as an archer on foot , " potens de corpore et bonis " . A muster roll described Hugh Tyldesley as an archer on horseback and Hugh Chaddock and Richard Tyldesley were foot @-@ archers drawing daily pay for service from 22 July to 21 October 1391 . 
 Cleworth Hall , recorded as <unk> in 1333 , was part of the Tyldesley lands on higher ground north of the high road . It passed to Nicholas Starkie of <unk> by his marriage to Anne Parr in 1578 and in 1594 was associated with witchcraft . Two children , John and Anne Starkie became " possessed of evil spirits " . A well @-@ known " conjurer " or wise man , Edmund Hartley , was asked to cure them , which he apparently did before demanding money which was refused . Hartley threatened trouble and Starkie denounced him and Hartley was taken for trial to Lancaster Castle in 1597 where he was tried and found guilty of witchcraft . He was hanged , twice , as the rope broke at the first attempt .

 In the early 18th century Tyldesley was a collection of cottages and farms around the halls scattered across the township with no church or inn . Thomas Johnson , a Bolton merchant bought the Banks Estate in 1728 , land from the Stanleys of Garrett Hall in 1742 and Davenports in the west of the township in 1752 . He died in 1764 leaving his estate to his grandson with the same name . Thomas " Squire " Johnson developed the town of <unk> Banks . His name lives on in Squires Lane and Johnson Street . The last quarter of the 18th century marked the beginning of a building boom and the grid plan of the town centre is from this date . 
 John Aikin described the area in 1795 in his book A Description of the Countryside from 30 to 40 Miles around Manchester : 
 The Banks of Tildesley , in the Parish of Leigh , are about one mile and a half in length , and command a most beautiful prospect into seven counties : the springs remarkably clear and most excellently adapted to the purposes of bleaching . The land is rich , but mostly in meadow and pastures , for milk , butter , and the noted Leigh cheese . The estate had , in the year 1780 , only two farm houses and eight or nine cottages , but now contains 162 houses , a neat chapel , and 976 inhabitants , who employ 325 looms in the cotton <unk> ... 
 Tyldesley 's first inns were the Flaming Castle built in 1778 and the Green Dragon of 1781 . <unk> House in Squires Lane was built in 1792 and occupied by local industrialists but was demolished in 1935 . Towards the end of the 18th century rows of two @-@ storey brick terraced houses were built at the west end of the town to house workers who had migrated there to work in the new factories . 
 = = = Industrial Revolution = = = 
 Until the Industrial Revolution , Tyldesley was rural , agriculture and cottage spinning and weaving , mainly muslin and fustian , were the chief occupations before 1800 . Silk weaving became an important cottage industry after 1827 when silk was brought from Manchester . 
 In 1772 Thomas Johnson opened the " Little Factory " for carding and spinning cotton . " The Great <unk> " powered a steam @-@ driven mill for woollen spinning on Factory Street in 1792 . More cotton mills were built close to the Hindsford and Shakerley Brooks which provided water for steam power . In 1823 , after a strike for increased wages and lockout by the millowners at New Mills , owned by J & G Jones in Factory Street , the workforce was sacked and new hands hired to replace them . The scab labourers , <unk> had to be protected from assault by the dismissed workers . Joseph Wilson built Hope Mill in James Street . By 1838 James Burton owned most of the town 's mills . He lived in Charles Street surrounded by his workers ' houses . His company owned 74 cottages and 57 cellars , a house in Elliot Street and the King 's Arms public house . Burton died in 1868 . In 1883 a fire at Burton 's mills caused £ 15 @,@ 000 damage ( equivalent to £ 1 @.@ 4 million in 2016 ) and by 1920 his mills were demolished . Caleb Wright owned Barnfield Mills which had a workforce of about 800 . The last of his mills , Barnfield No 6 on Shuttle Street , was built in 1894 on the site of Resolution Mill which was destroyed by fire in 1891 . Barnfield No 6 was a concrete @-@ floored multi @-@ storey mill for spinning , powered by an external engine house via a rope race . The mill was demolished in the 1990s and the site is occupied by a supermarket . 
 Coal had been got in Shakerley since at least 1429 when a dispute was recorded between the <unk> and the Tyldesleys over the stealing of " <unk> " . Shakerley Colliery on Shakerley Common was in existence in 1798 . Shakerley was a centre for making nails , but was in decline by 1800 . 
 After the railway was completed in 1864 , coal mining became the dominant industry and the town was surrounded by collieries for more than 100 years until the industry declined after the Second World War . Bridgewater Collieries , Tyldesley Coal Company , Shakerley Collieries and Astley and Tyldesley Collieries were among the local mine owners . Gin Pit Colliery closed in 1955 , Cleworth Hall in 1963 , Nook two years later , and Mosley Common in 1968 . Tyldesley Miners Association , established in 1862 , built the Miner 's Hall in 1893 and the Astley and Tyldesley Miner 's Club opened at Gin Pit in 1927 . 
 The worst mining disaster in the town occurred at Yew Tree Colliery on 11 December 1858 when an explosion of firedamp caused by a safety lamp cost 25 lives , the youngest victim was 11 , and the oldest , 35 years of age . Some of the victims are buried in the churchyard at St George 's Church . Another explosion on 6 March 1877 at Great Boys Colliery cost eight lives and on 2 October 1883 , six men died when the cage rope broke at Nelson Colliery in Shakerley . On 1 October 1895 five men including the colliery manager and <unk> died at Shakerley Colliery after an explosion of firedamp . 
 Grundy 's Foundry was another important employer . Its founder , John Grundy invented a warm air heating system that was used in churches and halls . He built a foundry close to the railway in Lower Elliot Street . 
 Industry declined after the Second World War and subsequent land reclamation and new housing developments have changed the face of the town , but its centre retains the atmosphere of a bustling market town , with a refurbished market square . The steep terraces branching off the main streets give the town a distinctive character .

 Historically , Tyldesley formed part of the Hundred of West Derby , a judicial division of southwest Lancashire . Tyldesley cum Shakerley was one of the six townships or vills that made up and predated the ancient parish of Leigh . It was the largest of the townships at 2 @,@ 610 acres ( 1 @,@ 060 ha ) : Tyldesley having an area of 1 @,@ 970 acres ( 800 ha ) and Shakerley 520 acres ( 210 ha ) . 
 Under the terms of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 the townships formed part of the Leigh Poor Law Union comprising an area covering the whole of the ancient parish of Leigh and part of Winwick , established on 26 January 1837 . A workhouse in Tyldesley was replaced by Leigh Union workhouse at Atherleigh in the 1850s . Tyldesley was constituted a civil parish in 1866 . In 1863 the Local Government Act 1858 was adopted and the township was governed by a local board of health . The first Tyldesley Local Board was formed after elections on 24 October 1863 . Among those elected were mill owners , Caleb Wright and Oliver Burton , and colliery owners , William Ramsden and George Green , a mixture of Tories and Liberals . The Local Board took over the gas works in 1865 , built the first swimming baths and opened Tyldesley Cemetery in 1876 and built sewage works at Morleys Hall in Astley in 1884 . The local board offices were in Lower Elliot Street , where it had a fire station and depot . Under the Public Health Act 1875 the local board gained additional powers as an urban sanitary district and under the Local Government Act 1894 Tyldesley @-@ with @-@ Shakerley became an urban district with an elected council . Tyldesley Town Hall , originally the township 's Liberal Club , opened in 1881 , and was taken over by Tyldesley Urban District Council as its headquarters in 1924 . Tyldesley UDC opened Tyldesley Park in 1902 , the Carnegie Library officially opened in 1909 , and after World War I council housing was built at Sale Lane and Mosley Common and after World War II in Shakerley . 
 In 1933 , Lancashire County Council reorganised districts in the county , with reference to the Local Government Act 1929 . A new Tyldesley Urban District was formed by amalgamating Tyldesley with Shakerley Urban District and the civil parish of Astley from the abolished Leigh Rural District . The urban district was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 , when the area became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan , a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester . 
 Tyldesley is an electoral ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan electing three councillors to the 75 @-@ member metropolitan borough council , Wigan 's local authority . As of 2015 , two ward councillors represent the Labour Party and one is an Independent . 
 The Boundary Commission recommended Tyldesley should be part of the Leigh constituency at the 2010 general election . At the 2010 General Election , Andy Burnham retained the Leigh seat for the Labour party with 24 @,@ 295 votes and a majority of 15 @,@ 011 , representing 51 @.@ 3 % of the vote .

The land rises from about 100 ft ( 30 m ) at the foot of the banks to 250 ft ( 76 m ) at the highest point . The banks , a sandstone escarpment with the scarp slope facing south and the gentler dip to the north , are about one and a half miles long . The underlying rocks are the coal measures of the Manchester Coalfield covered with boulder clay . Streams drain the area including the Shakerley and Hindsford Brooks which flow towards the Glaze Brook a tributary of the River Mersey . 
 Heavily industrialised during the 19th century , Tyldesley has become a residential area since the demise of the coal industry and closure of its cotton mills . The main road through Tyldesley is the A577 which runs on the high ground along the ridge on which the town centre is situated .

 For many years Tyldesley 's landscape was dominated by factory chimneys and pit headgear . Since the closure of the mines and demolition of the factories , St George 's Church — one of the few structures in the town built of stone , with a spire rising to 150 feet ( 46 m ) in height — and Top Chapel in the Market Square have become the chief landmarks ; both are Grade II listed buildings . Tyldesley 's built environment is almost uniformly constructed of brick . 
 Among the listed buildings in Tyldesley are Chaddock Hall and Damhouse , both Grade II listed . Chaddock Hall is a private residence and Damhouse or Astley Hall is a heritage centre having previously been used as the office block for Astley Hospital .

 Edward Entwistle , the driver of the first inter @-@ city scheduled passenger train in the world , was born in Tyldesley in 1815 . He drove the passenger service on the Liverpool to Manchester railway . 
 In 1861 the London and North Western Railway revived powers granted to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to build a railway from Eccles to Wigan through the town . Tyldesley railway station was to the east of the junction of the branch to Kenyon Junction on the Liverpool to Manchester Line via Leigh and Pennington . The Earl of Ellesmere cut the first sod at Worsley on 11 September 1861 and the line opened to traffic on 1 September 1864 . The Tyldesley Loopline closed on 3 May 1969 as a result of the Beeching Axe . 
 In 1900 , a Bill authorising South Lancashire Tramways to construct more than 62 miles ( 100 km ) of tramway in southern Lancashire was given Royal Assent . However , by November 1900 the South Lancashire Electric Traction and Power Company had acquired the shares . The first section of tramway opened on 20 October 1902 between Lowton and Four Lanes Ends via Leigh and Atherton and on 25 October 1902 a branch from Atherton to Tyldesley was opened and Tyldesley got its first tram . The company got into financial difficulty and in turn became Lancashire United Tramways later Lancashire United Transport . In August 1931 trams were replaced by trolley buses . Because of Tyldesley 's narrow streets trams and trolley buses had to follow a one @-@ way system ; eastbound trams ran along Shuttle Street and Milk Street and westbound used Elliot Street and Castle Street , a system now used by all traffic . Tyldesley is connected to neighbouring towns by bus services operated by Diamond Bus North West of Atherton and First Greater Manchester . 
 The former trackbed of the Tyldesley Loopline route to the A580 , within the Wigan MBC area was reserved in the Unitary Development Plan in case the rail route could be reinstated . A guided busway was built on the former trackbed but the proposal was not universally popular . After consultations work started on the 4 @.@ 5 @-@ mile busway from Leigh to Ellenbrook in 2013 . It has four stops , Cooling Lane , Astley Street , Hough Lane and Sale Lane and one of its three park and ride sites in Tyldesley . A pathway for walkers , cyclists and horse riders runs alongside it .

 George Ormerod gave a site for a national school near St George 's Church , it catered for all age groups when it opened in 1827 . A day school was opened in the old Wesley Chapel in 1856 and in 1864 was replaced by new school which lasted until 1912 . A church school opened in Johnson St in 1872 and closed the 1960s .

Other primary schools are Tyldesley Primary School and Garrett Hall Primary . Until 2007 there was a school in Shakerley but this has closed . Kingshill Special School occupying the old girls ' secondary school , has closed . 
 The main school for secondary education in Tyldesley is Fred Longworth High School , which was awarded Arts College status in 1998 .

 John Wesley preached in Shakerley four times , between 1748 and 1752 , laying the foundations for a place of worship . In the 1780s George Whitfield who worked with Wesley early in his ministry also preached there . Tyldesley 's first place of worship , Top Chapel was built in the Square in 1789 for the Countess of Huntingdon 's Connexion which had broken from the Church of England . Thomas Johnson , gifted the site on the highest point of Tyldesley and Lady Huntingdon , a supporter of Wesley supplied money for building materials . The chapel became known as Top Chapel from its geographical location . 
 Before 1825 Tyldesley had no established church , and lay within the ancient parish of Leigh in the Diocese of Chester . The diocese divided in 1847 , when the present Diocese of Manchester was created . For ritual baptisms , marriages and burials , the population , had to travel to churches outside of the township 's boundaries , Leigh Parish Church or its daughter churches , Astley Chapel or Atherton Chapel or to Deane or Eccles . 
 The St George 's Church a chapel of ease to Leigh , St Mary 's , was built in 1825 on land donated by Thomas Johnson . It was a Commissioners ' Church , paid for by money from the parliament of the United Kingdom raised by the Church Building Act 1818 , said to be a celebration of Britain 's victory in the Battle of Waterloo . Robert Smirke an official architect to the Office of Works , advised the Parliamentary Commissioners on the building of new churches from 1818 onwards , including St George 's . The chapel was consecrated on 19 September 1825 , dedicated to England 's patron saint . The church could seat 1 @,@ 100 people , it is 112 feet ( 34 m ) in length , 60 feet ( 18 m ) in width and its spire , a local landmark is 150 feet ( 46 m ) in height . George Ormerod gave the land for the churchyard and also six bells which were cast at Downham Market . 
 There were chapels of the Congregational , Primitive Methodist , Wesleyan Methodist , Baptist , Welsh Congregational , Welsh Calvinistic and Independent Methodist connexions . Welsh chapels served the Welsh people who migrated toto the town after the opening of the railway in 1864 .

After the schism , the club was a founder member of the Northern Rugby Football Union ( now Rugby League ) and played for five seasons from 1895 – 96 to 1899 – 1900 finishing 6th of 22 in the initial combined league . The club rejoined the Rugby Football Union in 1911 playing at Well Street for many years before moving to St George 's Park on Astley Street in November 2001 . In 2008 / 09 season the 1st XV lost 8 – 7 to Cullompton in the Senior Vase Final at Twickenham .

 Tyldesley 's wealth as an industrial town resulted in outlets for the entertainment of its population , including cinemas and public houses . Films were shown in Tyldesley Miners ' Hall from 1908 . Three cinemas were built in the town , the Theatre Royal in John Street opened in 1909 , the Carlton on Johnson Street in 1911 , and the Majestic in Castle Street in 1923 .

 = Evstafi @-@ class battleship = 
 The Evstafi class were a pair of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the Imperial Russian Navy built before World War I for the Black Sea Fleet . They were slightly enlarged versions of the Russian battleship Potemkin , with increased armour and more guns . Numerous alterations were made as a result of experience in the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 5 that seriously delayed the completion of the two ships . 
 They were the most modern ships in the Black Sea Fleet when World War I began and formed the core of the fleet for the first year of the war , before the newer dreadnoughts entered service . They forced the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben to disengage during the Battle of Cape Sarych shortly after Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire in late 1914 . Both ships covered several bombardments of the Bosphorus fortifications in early 1915 , including one where they were attacked by the Goeben , but they managed to drive her off . Later , Evstafi and Ioann Zlatoust were relegated to secondary roles after the first dreadnought entered service in late 1915 , and were subsequently put into reserve in 1918 in Sevastopol . 
 Both ships were captured when the Germans took the city in May 1918 and was turned over to the Allies after the Armistice in November 1918 . Their engines were destroyed in 1919 by the British when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians . They were abandoned when the Whites evacuated the Crimea in 1920 and were scrapped in 1922 – 23 .

The two conning towers ' sides were 8 inches ( 203 mm ) in thickness with a 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) roof . The decks ranged from 1 @.@ 37 – 3 inches ( 35 – 76 mm ) in thickness . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Construction of both ships began well before the formal keel @-@ laying ceremony ; Evstafi on 13 July 1904 and Ioann Zlatoust on 13 July 1903 , although the working drawings and preliminary calculations were not approved until 31 May 1904 , which caused some problems with Ioann Zlatoust . Progress was relatively quick , despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution , and both ships were launched less than three years after work began . Fitting @-@ out , however , was considerably delayed by a number of changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo @-@ Japanese War . Maximum elevation of the main guns was increased from 15 degree to 35 degrees , the number of torpedo tubes was reduced from five to two , mine stowage was eliminated as were the 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) guns . The armour protection of the waterline fore and aft of the main belt was increased to prevent the sort of damage that disabled several ships at the Battle of Tsushima . A second conning tower was added at the rear of the superstructure and its design was altered , probably to eliminate the overhanging top that deflected splinters into the conning tower at the Battle of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima . The masts and their fighting tops were replaced by light pole masts and light booms replaced the heavy boat cranes to save weight . 
 = = World War I = = 
 Evstafi , as the newest ship in the Black Sea Fleet , was the flagship of Vice Admiral Andrei Eberhardt for the first year or so of World War I. Two weeks after the Russian declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire on 2 November 1914 , the Black Sea Fleet set out to bombard Trebizond on 15 November . The force consisted of the pre @-@ dreadnoughts Evstafi , Ioann Zlatoust , Pantelimon , Rostislav , Tri Sviatitelia and three cruisers escorted by three destroyers and 11 torpedo boats . They did this successfully on the morning of 17 November and then turned west to hunt for Turkish shipping along the Anatolian coast before setting course for Sevastopol later that afternoon . The following day , while en route , the ships were intercepted by the German battlecruiser Goeben and the light cruiser SMS Breslau in what came to be known as the Battle of Cape Sarych . 
 Despite the noon hour the conditions were foggy and the capital ships initially did not spot each other . The Black Sea Fleet had experimented on concentrating fire from several ships under the control of a " master ship " before the war and Evstafi held her fire until Ioann Zlatoust , the master ship , could see Goeben . When the gunnery commands were finally received they showed a range over 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) in excess of Evstafi 's own estimate of 7 @,@ 700 yards ( 7 @,@ 000 m ) , so Evstafi opened fire using her own data before Goeben turned to unmask its broadside . She scored a hit with her first salvo as a 12 @-@ inch shell partially penetrated the armor casemate protecting one of Goeben 's 15 @-@ centimetre ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) secondary guns . It detonated some of the ready @-@ use ammunition , starting a fire that burnt out the casemate and killed its crew . 
 Goeben returned fire shortly afterward and hit Evstafi in the middle funnel ; the shell detonated after it passed through the funnel and destroyed the antennae for the fire @-@ control radio , which meant that Evstafi could not correct Ioann Zlatoust 's inaccurate range data . The other ships either used Ioann Zlatoust 's incorrect data or never saw Goeben and failed to register any hits on the German ship . Goeben hit Evstafi four more times , although one shell failed to detonate , before Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon decided to turn away and break contact after fourteen minutes of combat . Evstafi suffered 34 killed and 24 wounded from those hits , and only fired between 12 and 16 twelve @-@ inch shells , as well as 14 eight @-@ inch and 19 six @-@ inch shells . Ioann Zlatoust fired only six shells from her main armament . 
 Several armour plates on Evstafi required replacement after the battle and they were taken from the old pre @-@ dreadnought Dvenadsat Apostolov , allowing the repairs to be complete by 29 November . On 9 January 1915 Breslau and the Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye encountered the Russian fleet while returning from a bombardment mission in the eastern part of the Black Sea . During a minor engagement Breslau hit Evstafi 's forward turret , temporarily putting it out of action , after which the two cruisers escaped using their superior speed . 
 = = = Coast bombardment = = = 
 Evstafi and Ioann Zlatoust served as the covering force for several bombardment missions of the Bosphorus between 18 March and 9 May 1915 . While the two earlier bombardments were uneventful , the 9 May bombardment provoked a reaction as Goeben intercepted the Russian battleships after they had been spotted by the Ottoman destroyer Numune @-@ i Hamiyet . Both forces turned on parallel courses and opened fire at the range of 17 @,@ 400 yards ( 15 @,@ 900 m ) , and although neither side scored a hit , Goeben had multiple near @-@ misses on Evstafi . Admiral Eberhardt then ordered his ships to make only 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ; 5 @.@ 8 mph ) , while Goeben was making 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) . Goeben was unable to cross the T of the Russian ships , despite its superior speed , as they were continually turning . This maneuver bought enough time that Tri Sviatitelia and Pantelimon were able to rejoin the other two ships before they could start shelling the Ottoman forts . Pantelimon then hit Goeben twice before the German ship broke contact after 22 minutes of firing . With the fleet assembled Admiral Eberhardt attempted to pursue the German battlecruiser , but was unsuccessful . 
 Both ships were subsequently fitted with anti @-@ aircraft guns on top of each of their turrets during 1915 , and screens were added on top of their funnels to keep out light bombs . Ioann Zlatoust initially received four 75 @-@ millimetre guns , but this was later altered to a pair of 75 mm guns and another pair of 63 @.@ 5 @-@ millimetre ( 2 @.@ 5 in ) guns . Evstafi first received three 75 mm guns , but these were later replaced by two 63 @.@ 5 mm guns and a pair of 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) guns . On 1 August 1915 she , and all the other pre @-@ dreadnoughts , were transferred to the 2nd Battleship Brigade , after the dreadnought Imperatritsa Mariya had entered service . On 1 October the new dreadnought provided cover while Ioann Zlatoust and Pantelimon bombarded Zonguldak and Evstafi shelled the nearby town of Kozlu . Later , both Evstafi @-@ class ships participated in the second bombardment of Varna in May 1916 . 
 Evstafi and Ioann Zlatoust were reduced to reserve in March 1918 in Sevastopol . Immobile , they were captured by the Germans there in May and handed over to the Allies the following December . The British wrecked their engines between 22 – 24 April 1919 when they left the Crimea in order to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians . Later , they were captured by both sides during the Russian Civil War , but were abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920 . The ships were then scrapped in 1922 – 23 , although they were not stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925 . 
 = Hasekura Tsunenaga = 
 Hasekura Rokuemon Tsunenaga ( or " Philip Francis Faxicura " , baptized as " Francisco Felipe Faxicura " , in Spain ) ( 1571 – 1622 ) ( Japanese : <unk> , also spelled Faxecura <unk> in period European sources , reflecting the contemporary pronunciation of Japanese ) was a Roman noble of Japanese imperial descent with ancestral ties to Emperor Kanmu and a Japanese samurai and retainer of Date Masamune , the daimyo of Sendai . 
 In the years 1613 through 1620 , Hasekura headed a diplomatic mission to the Vatican in Rome , traveling through New Spain ( arriving in Acapulco and departing from Veracruz ) and visiting various ports @-@ of @-@ call in Europe . This historic mission is called the <unk> Embassy ( <unk> ) , and follows the Tenshō embassy ( <unk> ) of 1582 . On the return trip , Hasekura and his companions re @-@ traced their route across Mexico in 1619 , sailing from Acapulco for Manila , and then sailing north to Japan in 1620 . He is conventionally considered the first Japanese ambassador in the Americas and in Europe . 
 Although Hasekura 's embassy was cordially received in Europe , it happened at a time when Japan was moving toward the suppression of Christianity . European monarchs such as the King of Spain thus refused the trade agreements Hasekura had been seeking . Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later , his embassy seemingly ending with few results in an increasingly isolationist Japan . 
 Japan 's next embassy to Europe would only occur more than 200 years later , following two centuries of isolation , with the " First Japanese Embassy to Europe " in 1862 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Little is known of the early life of Hasekura Tsunenaga . According to " Date <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) " , he was of Japanese imperial descent and had ancestral ties with Emperor Kanmu . He was a mid @-@ level noble samurai in the Sendai Domain in northern Japan , who had the opportunity to directly serve the daimyo Date Masamune . He spent his young adulthood at the scenic <unk> Castle ( <unk> ) that was constructed in Hasekura @-@ ward , Kawasaki @-@ city ( ex @-@ Hasekura village ) , Miyagi prefecture by his grand father <unk> ( <unk> ) Hasekura . The place of origin of the family name " Hasekura " is the present Hasekura @-@ ward ( <unk> ) , Kawasaki @-@ city that had once been Hasekura village ( <unk> ) . Hasekura and Date Masamune were of roughly the same age , and it is recorded that several important missions were given to Tsunenaga as his representative . 
 It is also recorded that Hasekura served as a samurai during the Japanese invasion of Korea under the Taiko Toyotomi Hideyoshi , for six months in 1597 . 
 In 1612 , Hasekura 's father , Hasekura <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , was indicted for corruption , and he was put to death in 1613 . His fief was confiscated , and his son should normally have been executed as well . Date , however , gave him the opportunity to redeem his honour by placing him in charge of the Embassy to Europe , and soon gave him back his territories as well . 
 = = Background : early contacts between Japan and Spain = = 
 The Spanish started trans @-@ Pacific voyages between New Spain ( Mexico and present U.S. California ) and the Philippines in 1565 . The famous Manila galleons carried silver from Mexican mines westward to the entrepôt of Manila in the Spanish possession of the Philippines . There , the silver was used to purchase spices and trade goods gathered from throughout Asia , including ( until 1638 ) goods from Japan . The return route of the Manila galleons , first charted by the Spanish navigator Andrés de Urdaneta , took the ships northeast into the Kuroshio Current ( also known as the Japan Current ) off the coast of Japan , and then across the Pacific to the west coast of Mexico , landing eventually in Acapulco . 
 Spanish ships were periodically shipwrecked on the coasts of Japan due to bad weather , initiating contacts with the country . The Spanish wished to expand the Christian faith in Japan . Efforts to expand influence in Japan were met by stiff resistance towards the Jesuits , who had started the evangelizing of the country in 1549 , as well as by the opposition of Portuguese and the Dutch who did not wish to see Spain participate in Japanese trade . However , some Japanese , such as Christopher and Cosmas , are known to have crossed the Pacific onboard Spanish galleons as early as 1587 . It is known that gifts were exchanged between the governor of the Philippines and Toyotomi Hideyoshi , who thanks him in a 1597 letter , writing " The black elephant in particular I found most unusual . " 
 In 1609 , the Spanish Manila galleon San Francisco encountered bad weather on its way from Manila to Acapulco , and was wrecked on the Japanese coast in Chiba , near Tokyo . The sailors were rescued and welcomed , and the ship 's captain , Rodrigo de Vivero , former interim governor of the Philippines , met with the retired shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu . Rodrigo de Vivero drafted a treaty , signed on 29 November 1609 , whereby the Spaniards could establish a factory in eastern Japan , mining specialists would be imported from New Spain , Spanish ships would be allowed to visit Japan in case of necessity , and a Japanese embassy would be sent to the Spanish court . 
 = = First Japanese expeditions to the Americas = = 
 = = = 1610 San Buena Ventura = = = 
 A Franciscan monk named Luis Sotelo , who was proselytizing in the area of what is now modern Tokyo , convinced Tokugawa Ieyasu and his son Tokugawa Hidetada to send him as a representative to New Spain ( Mexico ) on one of their ships , in order to advance the trade treaty . Rodrigo de Vivero offered to sail on the Japanese ship in order to guarantee the safety of their reception in New Spain , but insisted that another Franciscan , named Alonso Muños , be sent instead as the Shogun 's representative . In 1610 , Rodrigo de Vivero , several Spanish sailors , the Franciscan father and 22 Japanese representatives led by the trader Tanaka Shōsuke sailed to Mexico aboard the San Buena Ventura , a ship built by the English adventurer William Adams for the Shogun . Once in New Spain , Alonso Muños met with the Viceroy Luis de Velasco , who agreed to send an ambassador to Japan in the person of the famous explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno with the added mission of exploring the " Gold and silver islands " ( " Isla de Plata " ) that were thought to be east of the Japanese isles . 
 Vizcaino arrived in Japan in 1611 and had many meetings with the Shogun and feudal lords . These encounters were tainted by his poor respect for Japanese customs , the mounting resistance of the Japanese towards Catholic proselytism , and the intrigues of the Dutch against Spanish ambitions . Vizcaino finally left to search for the " Silver island " , during which search he encountered bad weather , forcing him to return to Japan with heavy damage . 
 = = = 1612 San Sebastian = = = 
 Without waiting for Vizcaino , another ship – built in Izu by the Tokugawa shogunate under the minister of the Navy Mukai Shogen , and named San Sebastian – left for Mexico on 9 September 1612 with Luis Sotelo onboard as well as two representatives of Date Masamune , with the objective of advancing the trade agreement with New Spain . However , the ship foundered a few miles from Uraga , and the expedition had to be abandoned . 
 = = The 1613 embassy project = = 
 The Shogun decided to build a new galleon in Japan in order to bring Vizcaino back to New Spain , together with a Japanese embassy accompanied by Luis Sotelo . The galleon , named Date Maru by the Japanese and later San Juan Bautista by the Spanish , took 45 days work in building , with the participation of technical experts from the Bakufu ( the Minister of the Navy Mukai Shogen , an acquaintance of William Adams with whom he built several ships , dispatched his Chief Carpenter ) , 800 shipwrights , 700 smiths , and 3 @,@ 000 carpenters . The daimyo of Sendai , Date Masamune , was put in charge of the project . He named one of his retainers , Hasekura Tsunenaga ( his fief was rated at around 600 koku ) , to lead the mission : 
 " The Great Ship left <unk> @-@ <unk> for the Southern Barbarians on 15 September [ Japanese calendar ] , with at its head Hasekura Rokuemon Tsunenaga , and those called Imaizumi Sakan , Matsuki Shusaku , Nishi <unk> , Tanaka <unk> , Naito <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , as well as several others under Rokuemon , as well as 40 Southern Barbarians , 10 men of Mukai Shogen , and also tradespeople , to a total 180 " ( Records of the Date House , <unk> @-@ Genna <unk> , Gonoi p . 56 ) . 
 The objective of the Japanese embassy was both to discuss trade agreements with the Spanish crown in Madrid , and to meet with the Pope in Rome . Date Masamune displayed a great will to welcome the Catholic religion in his domain : he invited Luis Sotelo and authorized the propagation of Christianity in 1611 . In his letter to the Pope , brought by Hasekura , he wrote : " I 'll offer my land for a base of your missionary work . Send us as many padres as possible . " 
 Sotelo , in his own account of the travels , emphasizes the religious dimension of the mission , claiming that the main objective was to spread the Christian faith in northern Japan : 
 " I was formerly dispatched as ambassador of <unk> Masamune , who holds the reins of the kingdom of <unk> [ Japanese : <unk> ] ( which is in the Eastern part of Japan ) — who , while he has not yet been reborn through baptism , has been <unk> , and was desirous that the Christian faith should be preached in his kingdom — together with another noble of his Court , Philippus Franciscus Faxecura <unk> , to the Roman Senate & to the one who at that time was in charge of the Apostolic See , His Holiness Pope Paul V. " ( Luis Sotelo De Ecclesiae Iaponicae <unk> <unk> , 1634 ) . 
 The embassy was probably , at that time , part of a plan to diversify and increase trade with foreign countries , before the participation of Christians in the Osaka rebellion triggered a radical reaction from the Shogunate , with the interdiction of Christianity in the territories it directly controlled , in 1614 .

 Upon completion , the ship left on 28 October 1613 for Acapulco with around 180 people on board , including 10 samurai of the Shogun ( provided by the Minister of the Navy Mukai Shogen <unk> ) , 12 samurai from Sendai , 120 Japanese merchants , sailors , and servants , and around 40 Spaniards and Portuguese , including Sebastian Vizcaino who , in his own words , only had the quality of a passenger . 
 = = = New Spain ( Acapulco ) = = = 
 The ship first reached Cape Mendocino in today 's California , and then continued along the coast to arrive in Acapulco on 25 January 1614 after three months at sea . The Japanese were received with great ceremony , but had to wait in Acapulco until orders were received regarding how to organize the rest of their travels . 
 Fights erupted between the Japanese and the Spaniards , especially Vizcaino , apparently due to some disputes on the handling of presents from the Japanese ruler . A contemporary journal , written by the historian Chimalpahin <unk> , a noble Aztec born in <unk> ( ancient Chalco province ) in 1579 , whose formal name was Domingo Francisco de San Anton <unk> , relates Vizcaino was seriously wounded in the fight : 
 " Señor Vizcaino is still coming slowly , coming hurt ; the Japanese injured him when they beat and stabbed him in Acapulco , as became known here in Mexico , because of all the things coming along that had been made his responsibility in Japan " 
 Following these fights , orders were promulgated on 4 and 5 March to bring peace back . The orders explained that : 
 " The Japanese should not be submitted to attacks in this Land , but they should remit their weapons until their departure , except for Hasekura Tsunenaga and eight of his retinue ... The Japanese will be free to go where they want , and should be treated properly . They should not be abused in words or actions . They will be free to sell their goods . These orders have been promulgated to the Spanish , the Indians , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the Blacks , and those who don 't respect them will be punished " .

 The embassy remained two months in Acapulco and entered Mexico City on 24 March , where it was received with great ceremony . The ultimate mission for the embassy was to go on to Europe . The embassy spent some time in Mexico , and then went to Veracruz to board the fleet of Don Antonio Oquendo . 
 Chimalpahin gives some account of the visit of Hasekura . 
 " This is the second time that the Japanese have landed one of their ships on the shore at Acapulco . They are transporting here all things of iron , and writing desks , and some cloth that they are to sell here . " ( Chimalpahin , " Annals of His Time " ) . 
 " It became known here in Mexico and was said that the reason their ruler the Emperor of Japan sent this said lordly emissary and ambassador here , is to go in Rome to see the Holy Father Paul V , and to give him their obedience concerning the holy church , so that all the Japanese want to become Christians " ( Chimalpahin , " Annals of His Time " ) . 
 Hasekura was settled in a house next to the Church of San Francisco , and met with the Viceroy . He explained to him that he was also planning to meet King Philip III to offer him peace and to obtain that the Japanese could come to Mexico for trade . On Wednesday 9 April , 20 Japanese were baptized , and 22 more on 20 April by the archbishop in Mexico , don Juan Pérez de la Serna , at the Church of San Francisco . Altogether 63 of them received confirmation on 25 April . Hasekura waited for his travel to Europe to be baptized there : 
 " But the lordly emissary , the ambassador , did not want to be baptized here ; it was said that he will be baptized later in Spain " ( Chimalpahin , " Annals of His Time " ) . 
 = = = = Departure for Europe = = = = 
 Chimalpahin explains that Hasekura left some of his compatriots behind before leaving for Europe : 
 " The Ambassador of Japan set out and left for Spain . In going he divided his vassals ; he took a certain number of Japanese , and he left an equal number here as merchants to trade and sell things . " ( Chimalpahin , " Annals of His Time " ) . 
 The fleet left for Europe on the San Jose on 10 June . Hasekura had to leave the largest parts of the Japanese group behind , who were to wait in Acapulco for the return of the embassy . 
 Some of them , as well as those from the previous travel of Tanaka Shōsuke , returned to Japan the same year , sailing back with the San Juan Bautista : 
 " Today , Tuesday the 14th of the month of October of the year 1614 , was when some Japanese set out from Mexico here going home to Japan . ; they lived here in Mexico for four years . Some still remained here ; they earn a living trading and selling here the goods they brought with them from Japan . " ( Chimalpahin , " Annals of His Time " ) .

 The fleet arrived in Sanlúcar de Barrameda on 5 October 1614 . 
 " The fleet arrived safely finally , after some dangers and storms , to the port of Sanlúcar de Barrameda on 5 October , where the Duke of Medina Sidonia was advised of the arrival . He sent carriages to honor them and accommodate the Ambassador and his gentlemen " ( Scipione Amati " History of the Kingdom of <unk> " ) . 
 " The Japanese ambassador Hasekura Rokuemon , sent by <unk> Masamune , king of Boju , entered Seville on Wednesday , 23 October 1614 . He was accompanied by 30 Japanese with blades , their captain of the guard , and 12 bowmen and <unk> with painted lances and blades of ceremony . The captain of the guard was Christian and was called Don Thomas , the son of a Japanese martyr " ( Library <unk> Colombina 84 @-@ 7 @-@ 19 Memorias ... , <unk> ) . 
 The Japanese embassy met with King Philip III in Madrid on 30 January 1615 . Hasekura remitted to the King a letter from Date Masamune , as well as offer for a treaty . The King responded that he would do what he could to accommodate these requests . 
 Hasekura was baptized on 17 February by the king 's personal chaplain , and renamed Felipe Francisco Hasekura . The baptism ceremony was to have been conducted by the Archbishop of Toledo , Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas , though he was too ill to actually carry this out , and the Duke of Lerma – the main administrator of Phillip III 's rule and the de facto ruler of Spain – was designated as Hasekura 's godfather . 
 The embassy stayed eight months in Spain before leaving the country for Italy .
