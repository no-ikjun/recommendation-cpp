 = Tropical Storm Bonnie ( 2010 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Bonnie was a weak tropical storm that brought squally weather to the northern Caribbean Sea and Gulf Coast of the United States in July 2010 . The third tropical cyclone and second named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season , Bonnie developed from a tropical wave over the Bahamas on July 22 . It strengthened to a tropical storm while crossing the islands , and made landfall on the southeastern coast of Florida the following day . Inland , Bonnie weakened to a tropical depression before entering the Gulf of Mexico , where its surface circulation dissipated on July 24 . The remnants of the storm moved ashore between Louisiana and Mississippi early on July 25 , prompting severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings in the area . 
 The precursor to Bonnie produced considerable amounts of rainfall across the Greater Antilles , resulting in light to moderate flooding . In the Dominican Republic , hundreds of people were displaced , and several bridges collapsed over rushing waters . One person drowned after being swept away by a swollen river in Puerto Rico . Elsewhere , light amounts of rainfall was reported in Haiti , the Bahamas and Florida . Effects were more severe from the remnants of Bonnie , with heavier rain amounts and higher winds reported near the Gulf Coast , especially in Louisiana . Damage as a result of the storm and its remnants totaled $ 1 @.@ 5 million ( 2010 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On July 10 , a tropical wave exited the African coast and moved westward over the open Atlantic for several days . Initially , the associated weather activity was limited to weak showers , and environmental conditions were not forecast to become conducive for significant organization . Although upper @-@ level wind shear remained somewhat adverse , a process of slow development became evident by July 19 as surface pressures began to fall . The wave proceeded along the extreme northeastern Caribbean , where convective activity waxed and waned due to periods of variable wind shear and brief land interaction with Hispaniola . By July 22 , <unk> activity reestablished over the Bahamas , with a distinct area of low pressure centered between the islands of Acklins and Great Inagua . Satellite observations confirmed a closed circulation , leading the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) to issue the formation of Tropical Depression Three around 1500 UTC . However , post @-@ storm analysis indicated that a depression had developed nine hours earlier than operationally confirmed . Upon its formation , the depression was forecast to be steered to the west @-@ northwest along a well @-@ established subtropical ridge . Later that day , minimum pressure dropped to 1006 mbar ( 29 @.@ 74 inHg ) , and satellite imagery showed an establishment of favorable outflow in nearly all quadrants . Although its cloud pattern remained disorganized — with the circulation center disassociated from the deepest convection — a reconnaissance aircraft flight into the cyclone found that the winds had increased . It was therefore upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie southeast of Nassau , Bahamas , about five hours after NHC initiated advisories on the system . 
 Around 2100 UTC , Bonnie moved over Ragged Island in the Bahamas with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , and shortly thereafter it attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . Due to increasingly unfavorable conditions aloft , little change in intensity occurred during the following day as the storm accelerated toward Florida . Though tropical storm @-@ force winds prevailed , they were confined to a few rainbands to the north and east of the center at that time , with the deepest convection dislocated over southeast Florida . On July 23 at 1430 UTC , the center of Bonnie made landfall near Elliott Key with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . Interaction with land caused the organization to deteriorate further , and its corresponding convection quickly diminished . In addition , a second reconnaissance flight affirmed a lack of significant winds ; it is estimated the cyclone lost tropical storm status around 1800 UTC that same day . On the morning of July 24 , deep convection briefly redeveloped over the center as Bonnie emerged into the Gulf of Mexico . Despite the redevelopment , the storm subsequently entered a region of intense upper @-@ level winds , causing associated convection to become sheared away rapidly . Embedded within a well @-@ established steering flow , Bonnie further degenerated to a tight swirl of low clouds , with no more than a few remaining patches of strong thunderstorms . Subsequent satellite images confirmed Bonnie no longer maintained a definable structure ; following the final advisory by the NHC , the system was pronounced dissipated while located about 100 mi ( 160 km ) from the mouth of the Mississippi River . The remnant low of Bonnie drifted west @-@ northwestward before dissolving over southeast Louisiana on July 25 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 When the NHC initiated advisories on Bonnie , a tropical storm warning was issued for the central and northwest islands of the Bahamas . In Florida , a tropical storm watch was issued for Golden Beach northward to Jupiter Inlet , and included Lake Okeechobee . In addition , a tropical storm warning was issued from Golden Beach to Bonita Springs on the west coast of the state , and included the Florida Keys and Florida Bay . By early July 23 , the tropical storm warning from Golden Beach to Bonita Springs was discontinued , while a tropical storm warning was issued from Englewood to Deerfield Beach , Florida . Six hours later , a tropical storm watch was put into effect for Destin , Florida to Morgan City , Louisiana ; it was later upgraded to a tropical storm warning . Three hours later , the tropical storm watch from Deerfield Beach to Jupiter Inlet , Florida and all tropical storm warnings in the Bahamas were discontinued . All tropical storm watches and warnings had been discontinued by 1500 UTC July 24 , shortly before Bonnie dissipated . 
 Three cruise ships , Carnival Pride , Carnival Destiny , and Grandeur of the Seas had to alter their courses due to the presence of Bonnie . Due to the threat of a tropical storm , Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency on July 22 . Along the Gulf Coast , concerns arose regarding the potential effects of the storm on the BP oil spill earlier in the year . Due to risk of intoxicated storm surge , authorities prepared for possible evacuations of low @-@ lying areas along coastlines . On July 23 , Admiral Thad Allen ordered the oil spill site to be evacuated , as Bonnie posed a safety threat to nearly 2 @,@ 000 people in that area . The ships and vessels in the area began preparation for evacuation on July 24 . Closer to shore , approximately 1 @,@ 300 fishing boats laying boom had to evacuate .

 The precursor to Bonnie brought significant rainfall to parts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola , leading to widespread flooding . In Puerto Rico , one person drowned after being caught in a swollen river , and roughly 500 people required evacuation in the Dominican Republic . According to officials in the Dominican Republic , the system produced more than 4 in ( 100 mm ) of rain across the territory . Several towns in the country were isolated after bridges collapsed . Some light flooding also occurred in Artibonite , Haiti , though no damage was reported . 
 As Bonnie moved through the Bahamas , residents stocked up on food and water as a precautionary measure ; however , no major preparations took place . Most businesses remained open during the system 's passage and schools were already closed for the summer . Throughout the islands , the effects from Bonnie were relatively minimal . Heavy rain fell across a few islands and copious lightning was reported . No known damage or loss of life took place .

 Due to the weak and disorganized structure of the storm , its effects upon landfall in Florida were minimal .

A storm surge of 0 @.@ 94 ft ( 0 @.@ 29 m ) was measured at Virginia Key . Tropical storm @-@ force winds were recorded in several areas , although sustained winds of over 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) were confined to Virginia Key .

Overall , monetary losses as a result of the storm in Florida amounted to $ 2 @,@ 000 ( 2010 USD ) . In Pinellas County , one person was hospitalized after being struck by lightning at Fred Howard Park on July 24 . 
 On July 25 , the remnants of Bonnie brought torrential rainfall to parts of Louisiana . In a 90 minute span , between 8 and 9 in ( 200 and 230 mm ) of rain fell in West Baton Rouge Parish . About 110 homes were flooded throughout the parish , resulting in $ 500 @,@ 000 ( 2010 USD ) in losses . Along Highway 15 , 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) of water was reported to have covered the road . In Washington Parish , more than 20 bridges and roads were washed out by flash flooding . Strong thunderstorms associated with the system also produced strong winds , estimated up to 69 mph ( 111 km / h ) , which downed several trees . A second day of severe weather on July 26 brought hurricane @-@ force wind gusts to portions of Vernon Parish ; two chicken houses were destroyed by the winds , killing 22 @,@ 000 chickens . Losses from the winds were estimated at $ 310 @,@ 000 ( 2010 USD ) . After moving through Louisiana , Bonnie 's remnants brought heavy rain to parts of Texas . In Hidalgo County , U.S. Route 69 was reportedly covered with high water . 
 Further inland , moisture from Bonnie combined with a cold front to produce widespread thunderstorms over Arkansas , Mississippi and Tennessee . In Arkansas , lightning from a severe thunderstorm knocked out power to much of the city of Rison after striking a transformer . Significant wind damage took place in Dallas County where awnings were blown off homes , structures sustained roof damage , and trees were felled . Heavy rains also triggered localized flash flooding , covering several highways . Throughout the state , storm damage was estimated at $ 356 @,@ 000 ( 2010 USD ) .

 Sivakasi was established during the early 15th century CE . Between 1428 and 1460 , a Pandya king <unk> <unk> Pandian ruled the southern part of Madurai region ( comprising modern day Sivakasi and it surroundings ) . As per Hindu legend , he wanted to construct a temple for Hindu god Shiva at Tenkasi and went to Kasi to bring a lingam ( an iconic representation of Shiva ) . While returning to his palace with the prized lingam , he rested under the grove of a <unk> tree , the favourite tree of Shiva . When a cow carrying the lingam refused to move from the point , the king realised that the wishes of Shiva were different from his own , and he placed the lingam in the place where the cow halted . The place where the " <unk> brought from Kasi " was installed came to be known as Sivakasi . Sivakasi was a part of Madurai region during the 16th century . Madurai became independent from Vijayanagar Empire in 1559 under the Nayaks . Nayak rule ended in 1736 and Madurai was repeatedly captured several times by Chanda Sahib ( 1740 – 1754 ) , Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan ( 1725 – 1764 ) in the middle of 18th century . In 1801 , Madurai came under the direct control of the British East India Company and was annexed to the Madras Presidency . 
 During the 1800s , Nadars , then aspiring business community , established their commercial base in the town . By the end of the 19th century , the Nadars ’ rapid rise as a business community and pursuit for higher social status caused resentment in higher castes . The mutual confrontation between the <unk> and Nadars reached its peak in 1899 , leading to a series of riots which became to be known as the Sivakasi riots . A total of 22 people were killed , as many as 800 houses and Big chariot in center of the city ( used by temple during festival ) were burnt during the riots . Eventually the riots came to an end after the intervention of the military in mid @-@ July 1899 . 
 The Sivakasi municipality was established in 1920 . After India 's independence from the British in 1947 , Sivakasi continued to be a municipality under the Madras state and later a part of Tamil Nadu , when the state was split on linguistic lines during 1953 , 1956 and 1960 and renamed in 1968 .

 = = Economy = = 
 The economy of Sivakasi is dependent on three major industries : fire crackers , match manufacturing and printing . The town has 520 registered printing industries , 53 match factories , 32 chemical factories , seven soda factories , four flour mills and two rice and oil mills . The town is the nodal center for firecracker manufacturing at the national level . In 2011 , the industry employed over 25 @,@ 000 people and some of the private enterprises had an annual turnover of ₹ 5 billion ( US $ 74 million ) . In 2011 , the combined estimated turnover of the firecracker , match making and printing industry in the town was around ₹ 20 billion ( US $ 300 million ) . Approximately 70 % of the firecrackers and matches produced in India are from Sivakasi . The hot and dry climate of the town is conducive for the firecracker and match making industries . The raw materials for these industries were procured from Sattur earlier , but was discontinued due to the high power and production cost . The source of raw materials is Kerala and Andaman . The paper for the printing industry is procured from various states . The town is a major producer of diaries , contributing to 30 % of the total diaries produced in India . Printing industry in the town was initially utilized for printing labels for the firecrackers and later evolved with modern machinery to grow as a printing hub . In 2012 , all the industries suffered 15 – 20 % production loss due to power shortage and escalating labor cost . 
 The major issues in the fireworks industry in Sivakasi is child labour and frequent accidents . In a blast in 1991 in a factory , 39 people were killed and 65 others were injured . In July 2009 , more than 40 people were killed in a fire accident in a firecracker unit . The police traced out unregistered units and irregularities that led to the accident . In a fire accident in August 2011 , seven people were killed and five were seriously injured . A similar fire accident and blast in a private unit in September 2012 killed 40 people and injured 38 others . The common reasons cited for the accidents are inadequate training of workers and supervisors involved in different stages of production and marketing of firecracker items . Other reasons are found to be overstocking of explosives , raw material and finished goods , and employment of workers in excess of the permitted strength . 
 Child labour in the industries , especially in match making factories , was at its peak during the 1970s and 1980s . In 1981 , the child work force in the age group 4 – 16 was 30 % of the total work force , 90 % of whom were girls . In 1986 , the National Child Labour project estimated child labour in <unk> match making industries to be 14 @,@ 121 children . The estimates indicated 80 % of the child labour belonging to Scheduled Castes ( SC ) , who were <unk> for centuries for cheap labour . Poverty and lack of farm produce were stated as the main reason for child labour . The employers also preferred children because of ease in management , discipline and lack of labour unions . The children in these industries suffered from back ache , neck ache , <unk> , malnutrition , <unk> disorders , dermatitis , respiratory disorders , over @-@ exhaustion , burn injuries and water borne diseases due to exposure to harmful chemicals in the work environment . The situation of the child labour came to light during an accident of a bus transporting the children in 1976 . The central government appointed a one @-@ man committee under <unk> Singh in 1978 , who reported abolishing child labour would seriously impact the economy of the region . The National Policy on child labour was formulated by the central government in August 1987 , aiming at the rehabilitation of children withdrawn from these factories . In 1988 , the union labour ministry initiated a programme for providing informal education , free health care and free lunch for children working in the factories . The Supreme Court of India , in a judgement ruled on December 1996 indicating provisions for preventing child labour like compensation for the child employed , employment to the adult members of the family and contribution to the corpus fund by the state government . From the establishment of child labour Act in 1986 till 2011 , 150 @,@ 000 inspections on child labour have been conducted in the factories , 1 @,@ 500 cases have been registered and few prosecutions have been made . The results indicated small amount of child labour in cottage and house hold industries .

 = Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis = 
 The Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis was a successful effort by the ownership group of the Vancouver Grizzlies to move the basketball team from the Canadian city of Vancouver , British Columbia , to the U.S. city of Memphis , Tennessee . The team began play as the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2001 – 02 season . It was the first of three National Basketball Association ( NBA ) franchise moves between 2001 and 2008 , and the third of four major league teams to relocate from Canada to the United States between 1995 and 2005 . 
 The Grizzlies had been created as an expansion team along with the Toronto Raptors in 1995 . For the six seasons in Vancouver , the Grizzlies performed poorly ; they only once finished better than last in the Midwest Division and never reached the playoffs . The Grizzlies were owned by Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment , who also owned the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . In 1999 , Bill Laurie , owner of the NHL team St. Louis Blues , attempted to buy the Grizzlies , with the intent to move it to St. Louis . After interference by the NBA , the Grizzlies were sold to Michael Heisley . He immediately started the process to relocate the team , and seven U.S. cities were candidates for the team — Anaheim , Buffalo , Memphis , New Orleans , Louisville , Las Vegas , and San Diego — before settling on the move to Memphis at the end of the season . 
 The first four Grizzlies seasons had given average attendance in the middle third of the league . However , the last two seasons saw a reduction to among the league 's lowest attendances ; participating reasons were the team 's poor performance and the 1998 – 99 NBA lockout . Contributing to the conditions for relocation were a weak Canadian dollar , unwillingness of some U.S. players to live in Canada , and lack of local ownership . 
 = = Background = = 
 Memphis has previously hosted a different major professional basketball team in the American Basketball Association ( ABA ) . Founded as the New Orleans Buccaneers in 1967 , the franchise moved to Memphis in 1970 , becoming known as the Pros . The team changed its name to the Tams and then the Sounds , before folding in 1975 prior to the ABA – NBA merger in 1976 . 
 The Grizzlies were created as an expansion team for the 1995 – 96 season which , along with the creation of the Toronto Raptors , saw the NBA expand into Canada . The Grizzlies were owned by Vancouver Canucks owner Arthur Griffiths . His company was in the process of building General Motors Place ( GM Place ) for the Canucks , and saw the Grizzlies as an additional tenant . Both Canadian teams ( the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors ) were hampered by the NBA 's decision to deny them one of the top five picks in the first draft , and the teams would not be allowed a top draft pick in the following three seasons , even if they should win the lottery . The teams were also hindered from using their full salary cap the first two seasons . For all six seasons in Vancouver , the Grizzlies had a terrible record . They finished seventh of seven in five seasons , and claimed one sixth place in the Midwest Division , never close to reaching the playoffs . The team won 101 games and lost 359 , giving a winning percentage of .220 . 
 = = Change of ownership = = 
 On 7 March 1995 , the majority of the holding company was sold from Griffiths to Seattle @-@ based John McCaw , Jr . On 12 November 1996 , McCaw bought the rest of company . He stated that he was committed to retaining the team in Vancouver . Griffiths was forced to sell the Canucks and Grizzlies following the cost overruns that occurred on GM Place , and the expansion fees to start the Grizzlies had made his company illiquid . 
 In 1999 , McCaw started attempts to sell either Orca Bay or the Grizzlies , and at first negotiated an agreement with Dennis Washington , owner of <unk> , who had a large portion of his operations in Vancouver . Washington initially agreed to purchase 50 % of Orca Bay , with the intent of keeping the teams in Vancouver . Instead , McCaw used Washington 's bid to leverage a higher sales price with Bill Laurie , who offered US $ 148 million for the Grizzlies , and a US $ 52 million bonus if the team ultimately relocated to St. Louis . The announcement was made in September 1999 , one month after Laurie had bought the NHL team St. Louis Blues and their home venue Kiel Center ( now Scottrade Center ) . St. Louis had not been the home of an NBA franchise since the Hawks franchise relocated to Atlanta , Georgia in 1968 . Kiel Center had annual sell @-@ out for 15 to 17 basketball games for the Saint Louis University Billikens . 
 After the deal was announced , NBA Commissioner David Stern stated that he was opposed to a relocation , as no NBA franchise had moved since 1985 , when the Kansas City Kings relocated to Sacramento , California . He stated that his goal was that the Grizzlies remain in Vancouver and succeed there . The NBA Board of Governors ' Finance Committee also made negative statements , as the purchase agreement was structured with incentives to move the team . The deal was then renegotiated before the board could vote on the issue . On 21 January 2001 , Laurie announced that he had paid McCaw an undisclosed amount to walk away from the deal . 
 Four days later , on 25 January , it was announced that the Grizzlies was sold to Chicago @-@ based Michael Heisley for US $ 160 million . At a press conference , he stated that he had the support of Stern , that he was committed to keeping the franchise in Vancouver , to making it a winning team , and that he was an owner that was committed to the market . 
 = = Reasons for relocation = = 
 Dick Versace , the Grizzlies ' president of basketball operations , stated in the final Vancouver season that the company was losing US $ 40 million per season . These numbers were questioned by Richard Peddie , CEO of the Raptors , as the Grizzlies had a salary cap of US $ 48 million . Retrospectively , Heisley stated that he lost US $ 87 million on owning the Grizzlies , although that included a US $ 30 million relocation fee to the NBA . Versace stated that he felt that the team did not get sufficient support from the business community . Colin Jones , University of Victoria professor in sports economics , stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team was losing so many games ; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win , thus losing revenue . He also noted that the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues . 
 Stu Jackson , general manager for the first five seasons , made several non @-@ optimal player selection decisions . This included selecting Bryant Reeves in the 1995 Draft , and signing him to a US $ 65 million six @-@ year contract extension in 1997 , putting the Grizzlies in a salary cap squeeze . From then he consequently drafted point guards , including Antonio Daniels , who failed to develop . Jackson traded a 2003 first @-@ round pick for Otis Thorpe , who " hated Vancouver " . He signed free agent Tony Massenburg for US $ 1 @.@ 5 million , just to sign Isaac Austin for US $ 5 @.@ 5 million and leave Massenburg on the bench . Griffiths retrospectively stated that the draft conditions from the NBA did not allow the franchise to build a winning team in years , and that the NBA had asked too high a price for not providing the means of a suitable income . On the other hand , the Raptors succeeded in drafting Vince Carter , reached the playoffs in the 1999 – 2000 season and played for a sell @-@ out crowd . 
 The location of the team in Canada was a major contributor ; at the time the exchange rate was 67 U.S. cents to the Canadian dollar . Because revenue was collected in Canadian dollars but player and coach salaries were paid in U.S. dollars , the team ended up spending an undue amount of its revenue on salaries . The 1998 – 99 lockout was the pivoting point for home game attendance . While the whole league experienced a drop in attendance after the lockout , Vancouver experienced an even larger fall . The average attendance in 1997 – 98 was 16 @,@ 108 , ranking 16th in the league , while it fell to 13 @,@ 899 in 1999 – 00 , ranking 27th . 
 Retrospectively , Griffiths stated that Heisley intentionally ran the team financially aground by alienating people , running insufficient marketing , and claiming basketball did not work in Vancouver . While running the team , Griffiths had not lost " millions and millions " and he stated that Vancouver had a better fan base than most NBA teams . The statements were denied by Heisley . 
 = = Proposed cities = = 
 With the public announcement in mid @-@ February of the possible relocation of the team , Heisley and representatives for the Grizzlies set out on a road trip to consider several U.S. cities which wanted to have the franchise relocate to their city . Originally Heisley had until 1 March to apply to the NBA for a relocation , but the deadline was later extended to 26 March . A similar deadline was also awarded to the Charlotte Hornets , who were also considering a relocation . 
 In February 2001 , the Louisville Board of Aldermen contacted the Grizzlies in an attempt to relocate the team to Louisville , Kentucky . The city lacked a suitable venue , but state and local officials agreed to build a new US $ 200 million arena if the NBA franchise relocated to the city . In addition , Tricon Global Restaurants ( now Yum ! Brands ) would offer Heisley US $ 5 million per year for 20 years to locate the team in Louisville . 
 The Memphis relocation effort was led by AutoZone founder Pitt Hyde , who promised to purchase 50 % of the team . The city had a 1991 venue , Pyramid Arena , which could be used as a temporary home until a new US $ 250 million venue was ready for use in 2004 . The venue would be publicly financed through sales tax rebates , government @-@ backed bonds and hotel and car rental taxes . The Memphis efforts to get an NBA team had started in 1997 , following the relocation of the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League to Nashville . 
 New Orleans , Louisiana mayor Marc Morial stated that he had approached Heisley in an attempt to attract the Grizzlies to his city . The city had opened the US $ 114 million New Orleans Arena ( now Smoothie King Center ) in 1999 , and offered it as a home to the franchise . <unk> , the area 's economic development chamber , stated that they had secured guarantees for purchasing suites , season tickets and club seating from businesses to the extent that there was a waiting list for suites . Also a relocation to St. Louis , under the same conditions as with Laurie , was considered . 
 Another option was to relocate to Anaheim , in the Greater Los Angeles area . The Houston Rockets had looked into relocation to Anaheim the previous season , with Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim ( now Honda Center ) as the home venue . However , the NHL team then known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim had an agreement that any other tenant at the Pond should share revenues with their then @-@ owner , The Walt Disney Company , although Disney stated they were willing to negotiate the terms . There are also two existing clubs in Los Angeles , the Lakers and the Clippers , which would make the media market small and limit revenue . 
 Buffalo , New York , announced interest in attracting the Grizzlies . The city had an appropriate venue in HSBC Arena ( now First Niagara Center ) , home of the Buffalo Sabres NHL ice hockey franchise . Mayor Anthony Masiello , a former college basketball star , stated that the attempt was " a long shot " , but worth the try . The city previously hosted an NBA franchise in the Buffalo Braves , which then relocated to become the San Diego Clippers in 1978 . The Clippers moved to Los Angeles in 1984 , and San Diego was also mentioned as a potential site for the Grizzlies , although the city lacked a suitable venue . Heisley visited Las Vegas , Nevada , where he negotiated with Mayor Oscar Goodman . The city offered the team free land for a new arena , but would not pay for construction . The other issue was Stern 's demand that casinos stop accepting bets on NBA games as a precondition of placing a team in Las Vegas . 
 The strongest bids were Memphis , Louisville , Anaheim and New Orleans . As the latter two had venues in place , they were seen as having an edge on the other two . Both Memphis and Louisville needed public funding for a new venue , and in either city , the team would have to play in a sub @-@ optimal location for several seasons . However , the construction of a new venue was seen as an advantage by the Grizzlies , as it could be tailor @-@ made for basketball , and the team would be able to control all revenue . The team also expected the highest local radio and television broadcasting rights in Louisville and Memphis , and that the two cities lacked other Big Four major league teams , granting the team preferred air times and increased attention from fans and media . A 2000 report from PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that small cities often had higher attendance than larger cities because of team 's professional league exclusivity . It also pointed to the strong support for college basketball in Tennessee and Kentucky . 
 = = Relocation = = 
 In Vancouver , the organization Save the Grizzlies was established to find a local investor to purchase the team . Led by among others Peter Ufford , they had a plan to create a public entity which could take over ownership of the team . Ufford retrospectively stated that had the attempt been given more time , they may have been able to secure a deal to keep the team in town , but that the relocation decision came too quickly for any plan to be finalized . Heisley stated that he had been willing to sell the team with a 30 % discount to a Vancouver investor if he could secure a guarantee that the team would remain in town . 
 On March 26 , 2001 , Heisley announced that he had selected Memphis . Memphis and Louisville were the most promising cities , with Heisley selecting Memphis because it offered a better deal and because of poor local executive leadership in Louisville . The choice would still have to be studied by a five @-@ member NBA group before permission was granted from the league . The team 's final game at GM Place was a 95 – 100 loss against the Houston Rockets on April 14 ; the team 's final game as a Vancouver @-@ based franchise was a road 95 – 81 win against the Golden State Warriors on April 18 . 
 The NBA relocation committee gave its approval for the move to Memphis in late June , and on July 3 the Board of Governors unanimously approved the relocation . This also permitted Hyde to purchase a minority share of the franchise . By then the team administration had already relocated , and the day before the final decision , the team set up its rookie camp at Rhodes College . A relocation party was held on July 7 . A week before the move , the Grizzlies traded away two of the top players , Shareef Abdur @-@ Rahim and guard Mike Bibby , who therefore never played for the Memphis Grizzlies . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The move to Memphis did not solve the Grizzlies ' financial problems , and as of 2011 the team 's cumulative loss was US $ 100 million . The team did manage a 50 @-@ win season , reach the playoff four times , but failed to advance in the playoffs until the 2010 – 11 season . As of 2011 , the Grizzlies remain , according to Forbes , the third least @-@ valuable NBA franchise , at US $ 266 million . Attendance never exceeded Vancouver levels ; in the inaugural season the Memphis Grizzlies had an average of 13 @,@ 737 spectators , and in the 2010 – 11 season had 14 @,@ 650 . 
 The Grizzlies were the first NBA relocation since the Kansas City Kings relocated to Sacramento , California and became the Sacramento Kings in 1985 . It was followed by two others in the same decade . The first was the relocation of the original Charlotte Hornets to New Orleans in 2002 , with the team becoming the New Orleans Hornets ( now Pelicans ) . ( That relocation is no longer treated by the league as such ; after the 2013 – 14 season , the franchise then known as the Charlotte Bobcats reclaimed the Hornets name and also received sole rights to the history of the Hornets in Charlotte . ) The second was in 2008 , when the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to become the Oklahoma City Thunder . In the NHL , two teams were moved from Canada to the U.S. during the mid @-@ 1990s : the Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche in 1995 , and the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996 and were rebranded as the Arizona Coyotes in 2014 ( a new Winnipeg Jets team returned to the city by relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers in 2011 ) . In 2005 , one of Canada 's two Major League Baseball teams ( the Montreal Expos ) relocated to Washington , D.C. and became the Washington Nationals . The failure of the Vancouver franchise was part of the reason the NBA changed the expansion drafting rules following the return of Charlotte to the league as the Bobcats in 2005 . The Bobcats were allowed to pick fourth in their first draft , and were later not restricted from first picks . 
 In a major change from 2001 — when one unnamed former NBA executive stated that a franchise would not return to Vancouver in his lifetime — Stern revealed in February 2011 that Vancouver was being considered along with Pittsburgh , Tampa and Kansas City . Reasons for considering Vancouver are the strengthening of the Canadian dollar , which for several years in the early 2010s was roughly at par with the U.S. dollar ; the influx of international players who would be more willing to play in Canada ; sell @-@ outs for pre @-@ season exhibition games at Rogers Arena ( the new name of GM Place ) ; Vancouver having a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art venue ; and an increased realization among NBA executives that the Vancouver failure was not predominantly because of lack of interest for basketball in Vancouver . The city has also been through a resurrection in professional sports , with the creation of the Vancouver Giants in junior hockey , the 2010 Winter Olympics , and Vancouver Whitecaps FC joining Major League Soccer . However , the location of the city also allows for more varied sports experiences , such as skiing , hunting , fishing and golf , which could partially limit the interest for spectator sports . 
 In 2011 , the ownership group of the Canucks , now owned by Francesco Aquilini , announced they were considering purchasing the Hornets . In December 2010 , the Hornets were bought by the league , and there was potential for relocation due to the club 's financial difficulties . However , a Hornets move was effectively taken off the table in 2012 when Tom Benson , a New Orleans native who already owned the NFL 's New Orleans Saints , purchased the team . One year later , Aquilini denied rumours that he wanted to purchase the Sacramento Kings from the Maloof family . Aquilini expressed that while Rogers Arena is ready for basketball , having the NBA in Vancouver comes down to market support , which his company assesses to see if it has improved since the Grizzlies left .

 Eddy Current Suppression Ring formed in 2004 , as a group of friends writing and performing songs together for fun . They decided to keep making their music when they discovered that other people liked it . The band recorded their first song as a trio , at a vinyl pressing plant where Eddy Current ( real name Mikey Young ) was working at the time . After they took a liking to the resulting song , they recruited Rob Solid ( real name Brad Barry ) to play bass guitar . The group recorded their debut self @-@ titled album in four hours in a rehearsal studio , and released it in 2006 on the Australian label Dropkick Records . 
 They recorded Primary Colours over the night of 3 August 2007 and part of the following day , in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra on an 8 @-@ track , a form of multi @-@ track recording . The process of recording it took 24 hours and cost $ 1500 . The day after recording finished , the band and their engineer , Lachlan Wooden , added overdubs to the ten tracks . After recording , Eddy Current Suppression Ring toured the US for three weeks , after which Eddy Current , the band 's guitarist , mixed the album during November and December 2007 . The four members self @-@ produced Primary Colours . 
 Eddy Current Suppression Ring 's lead singer , Brendan Suppression ( real name Brendan Huntley ) , explained the choice of Primary Colours as its title , saying that the band chose it because they " believe ... that something beautiful can be made through simple colours or notes or lyrics " . In an interview with The Age , Suppression also said that Primary Colours 's title refers to the way that everything is made up of a combination of simple things , as all colours are made by combining primary colours . 
 Primary Colours was originally released in Australia on 5 May 2008 on Eddy Current Suppression Ring 's own label , <unk> ! Records , before being issued on 9 September 2008 in the United States on Goner Records . In Australia it was distributed by Shock Records . " Which Way to Go " was released as the only single . The following year , on 17 August , Primary Colours was re @-@ released on Melodic Records in the United Kingdom , in conjunction with the band 's eponymous debut album . On this release , the album 's title was stylised with a " + " symbol at the end , with Primary Colours denoted as " CD1 " . Primary Colours was originally presented in one of three different album covers – one red , one yellow , and one blue . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 The lyrics on Primary Colours often focus on mundane topics pertaining to the lives of ordinary people , including watching TV and eating ice cream , while its music often features shredding power chords . According to The Washington Post 's Chris Richards , the music represents a new , gentler type of punk rock in the vein of No Age and Abe Vigoda . Richards also wrote that Suppression " [ keeps ] these upbeat rock tunes from becoming too saccharine with a nervy delivery that 's part David Byrne , part Iggy Pop " . A similar sentiment was expressed by David Bevan of Pitchfork Media , who wrote " there 's a softening of edges taking place throughout , a band testing limits after having already refined them " . He also described it as an " artfully polished extension of its predecessor " . Current described the album as " a bit more ' <unk> than the ' <unk> sound of our first LP , slightly less frantic and maybe a bit more palatable " . 
 The album 's opening track , " Memory Lane " , begins with guitar chopping described by Emily Mackay as " Stones @-@ meets @-@ Stooges <unk> " . The second track on the album , " Sunday 's Coming , " is an " all @-@ out <unk> " featuring " whiplash guitars " and " so @-@ nonchalant @-@ they ’ re @-@ muffled vocals " . " Wrapped Up " contains " ribbons of guitar melody " matched with an " equally warm refrain " . " Colour Television " consists of " five minutes of unhurried , snaky buildups " resembling the sound of The Pixies and Future of the Left . " That 's Inside of Me " is a " Feelies @-@ esque instrumental " with a " herky @-@ jerky funk groove " . The " glumly confessional " " I Admit My Faults " focuses on the same mood for its entire duration . " Which Way to Go " , the album 's single , begins with heavy riffage , then segues to the verse , then the chorus , then repeats from the beginning . The song 's " sharp riffs , fiery speak @-@ sing vocals and constant forward momentum " exemplify the band 's typical sound . " You Let Me Be Honest with You " is centred on a lead guitar solo from Current . " We 'll Be Turned On " sees Eddy Current Suppression Ring using an organ , and Suppression making an especially " goofy turn " . " I Don 't Wanna Play No More " features a single @-@ note piano riff that recalls " I Wanna Be Your Dog " .

 Primary Colours received generally positive critical reception , so much so that Eddy Current Suppression Ring 's front man , Current , remarked that it was " weird " because he didn 't " know if anyone 's said a bad word about it " . Bevan awarded Primary Colours a rating of 8 @.@ 2 out of 10 . Robert Christgau gave the album a rating of A − , which , according to him , corresponds to " the kind of garden @-@ variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction " . He also wrote that they do " the same thing punk bands have always done " and described the album as a " recurring miracle . " Chris Richards compared the album to many early punk and post @-@ punk bands such as " a <unk> Stooges " or " The Fall with less squall " . He concluded that the album was " the most righteous rock @-@ and @-@ roll moment of 2008 " . A more mixed review written by Emily Mackay awarded Primary Colours a rating of 7 out of 10 and criticised it for its lack of originality . 
 Many critics also praised Current 's guitar work on the album , with Richards writing that his riffs " come ripping from his amplifier like sunbeams through a smog of distortion " . Writing for Spin , Chuck Eddy wrote that Current 's guitar chords " soar Byrds @-@ like or surf Ventures @-@ like out of melodic stomps that seem basic , but aren 't " . K. Ross Hoffman , writing for Allmusic , praised the song " Wrapped Up " for its " strong , slinky riff " , while Bevan praised it for the way it " runs along some really beautiful ribbons of guitar melody " .

 On 20 March 2009 , Primary Colours won the $ 30 @,@ 000 Australian Music Prize for the previous year , defeating eight other nominees , including Cut Copy and the Presets . Eddy Current Suppression Ring told Triple J that they didn 't expect their recording plans to change significantly as a result of the win , but that they might be able to do them more quickly . At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008 , it was nominated in the category " Best Rock Album " , but lost to The Living End 's entry , White Noise . Current described this nomination as " nice , but mainly hilarious " . 
 Primary Colours was featured on several critics ' year @-@ end lists , including the 2008 Pazz & Jop ( No. 73 ) , the Washington Post 's David Malitz 's top 10 albums of 2008 ( No. 5 ) , and The Guardian 's 2009 critics ' poll ( No. 28 ) .

 Charles Edward Anderson " Chuck " Berry ( born October 18 , 1926 ) is an American guitarist , singer and songwriter and is one of the pioneers of rock and roll music . With songs such as " Maybellene " ( 1955 ) , " Roll Over Beethoven " ( 1956 ) , " Rock and Roll Music " ( 1957 ) and " Johnny B. Goode " ( 1958 ) , Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive , with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music . 
 Born into a middle @-@ class African @-@ American family in St. Louis , Missouri , Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School . While still a high @-@ school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory , where he was held from 1944 to 1947 . After his release , Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant . By early 1953 , influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T @-@ Bone Walker , Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio . His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters , who suggested he contact Leonard Chess , of Chess Records . With Chess he recorded " Maybellene " — Berry 's adaptation of the country song " Ida Red " — which sold over a million copies , reaching number one on Billboard magazine 's rhythm and blues chart . By the end of the 1950s , Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career . He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub , Berry 's Club Bandstand . But in January 1962 , he was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Act — he had transported a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl across state lines . 
 After his release in 1963 , Berry had more hits in the mid @-@ 1960s , including " No Particular Place to Go " , " You Never Can Tell " , and " Nadine " . By the mid @-@ 1970s , he was more in demand as a live performer , playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality . In 1979 he served 120 days in prison for tax evasion . 
 Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986 ; he was cited for having " laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance . " Berry is included in several of Rolling Stone magazine 's " greatest of all time " lists ; he was ranked fifth on its 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time . The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll includes three of Berry 's : " Johnny B. Goode " , " Maybellene " , and " Rock and Roll Music " . Berry 's " Johnny B. Goode " is the only rock @-@ and @-@ roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record .

 Born in St. Louis , Missouri , Berry was the fourth child in a family of six . He grew up in the north St. Louis neighborhood known as The Ville , an area where many middle @-@ class people lived at the time . His father , Henry , was a contractor and deacon of a nearby Baptist church ; his mother , Martha , was a certified public @-@ school principal . His middle @-@ class upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age . He gave his first public performance in 1941 while still a student at Sumner High School . 
 In 1944 , while still a student at Sumner High School , he was arrested for armed robbery after robbing three shops in Kansas City , Missouri , and then stealing a car at gunpoint with some friends . Berry 's account in his autobiography is that his car broke down and he flagged down a passing car and stole it at gunpoint with a nonfunctional pistol . He was convicted and sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa , near Jefferson City , Missouri , where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing . The singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility . Berry was released from the reformatory on his 21st birthday in 1947 . 
 Berry married <unk> " Toddy " Suggs on October 28 , 1948 , who gave birth to Darlin Ingrid Berry on October 3 , 1950 . Berry supported his family by taking various jobs in St. Louis , working briefly as a factory worker at two automobile assembly plants and as a janitor in the apartment building where he and his wife lived . Afterwards he trained as a beautician at the <unk> College of Cosmetology , founded by Annie <unk> Malone . He was doing well enough by 1950 to buy a " small three room brick cottage with a bath " on Whittier Street , which is now listed as the Chuck Berry House on the National Register of Historic Places . 
 By the early 1950s , Berry was working with local bands in clubs in St. Louis as an extra source of income . He had been playing blues since his teens , and he borrowed both guitar riffs and showmanship techniques from the blues musician T @-@ Bone Walker . He also took guitar lessons from his friend Ira Harris , which laid the foundation for his guitar style . 
 By early 1953 Berry was performing with Johnnie Johnson 's trio , starting a long @-@ time collaboration with the pianist . The band played mostly blues and ballads , but the most popular music among whites in the area was country . Berry wrote , " Curiosity provoked me to lay a lot of our country stuff on our predominantly black audience and some of our black audience began whispering ' who is that black hillbilly at the Cosmo ? ' After they laughed at me a few times they began requesting the hillbilly stuff and enjoyed dancing to it . " 
 Berry 's calculated showmanship , along with a mix of country tunes and R & B tunes , sung in the style of Nat King Cole set to the music of Muddy Waters , brought in a wider audience , particularly affluent white people .

 In May 1955 , Berry traveled to Chicago , where he met Muddy Waters , who suggested he contact Leonard Chess , of Chess Records . Berry thought his blues music would be of more interest to Chess , but to his surprise it was a traditional country fiddle tune , " Ida Red " , as recorded by Bob Wills , that got Chess 's attention . Chess had seen the rhythm and blues market shrink and was looking to move beyond it , and he thought Berry might be the artist for that purpose . On May 21 , 1955 , Berry recorded an adaptation of the " Ida Red " , under the title " Maybellene " , with Johnnie Johnson on the piano , Jerome Green ( from Bo Diddley 's band ) on the maracas , Jasper Thomas on the drums and Willie Dixon on the bass . " Maybellene " sold over a million copies , reaching number one on Billboard magazine 's rhythm and blues chart and number five on its Best Sellers in Stores chart for September 10 , 1955 . 
 At the end of June 1956 , his song " Roll Over Beethoven " reached number 29 on the Billboard 's Top 100 chart , and Berry toured as one of the " Top Acts of ' 56 " . He and Carl Perkins became friends . Perkins said that " I knew when I first heard Chuck that he 'd been affected by country music . I respected his writing ; his records were very , very great . " As they toured , Perkins discovered that Berry not only liked country music but also knew about as many songs as he did . Jimmie Rodgers was one of his favorites . " Chuck knew every Blue <unk> and most of Bill Monroe 's songs as well , " Perkins remembered . " He told me about how he was raised very poor , very tough . He had a hard life . He was a good guy . I really liked him . " 
 In late 1957 , Berry took part in Alan Freed 's " Biggest Show of Stars for 1957 " , touring the United States with the Everly Brothers , Buddy Holly , and others . He was a guest on ABC 's Guy Mitchell Show , singing his hit song " Rock ' n ' Roll Music " . The hits continued from 1957 to 1959 , with Berry scoring over a dozen chart singles during this period , including the US Top 10 hits " School Days " , " Rock and Roll Music , " , " Sweet Little Sixteen " , and " Johnny B. Goode " . He appeared in two early rock @-@ and @-@ roll movies : Rock Rock Rock ( 1956 ) , in which he sang " You Can 't Catch Me " , and Go , Johnny , Go ! ( 1959 ) , in which he had a speaking role as himself and performed " Johnny B. Goode " , " Memphis , Tennessee " , and " Little Queenie " . His performance of " Sweet Little Sixteen " at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1958 was captured in the motion picture Jazz on a Summer 's Day . 
 By the end of the 1950s , Berry was a high @-@ profile established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career . He had opened a racially integrated St. Louis nightclub , Berry 's Club Bandstand , and invested in real estate . But in December 1959 , he was arrested under the Mann Act after questionable allegations that he had sexual intercourse with a 14 @-@ year @-@ old Apache waitress , Janice Escalante , whom he had transported across state lines to work as a <unk> girl at his club . After a two @-@ week trial in March 1960 , he was convicted , fined $ 5 @,@ 000 , and sentenced to five years in prison . He appealed the decision , arguing that the judge 's comments and attitude were racist and prejudiced the jury against him . The appeal was upheld , and a second trial was heard in May and June 1961 , resulting in another conviction and a three @-@ year prison sentence . After another appeal failed , Berry served one and one @-@ half years in prison , from February 1962 to October 1963 . He had continued recording and performing during the trials , but his output had slowed as his popularity declined ; his final single released before he was imprisoned was " Come On " . 
 = = = " Nadine " and move to Mercury ( 1963 – 1969 ) = = = 
 When Berry was released from prison in 1963 , his return to recording and performing was made easier because British invasion bands — notably the Beatles and the Rolling Stones — had sustained interest in his music by releasing cover versions of his songs , and other bands had reworked some of them , such as the Beach Boys ' 1963 hit " Surfin ' U.S.A. " , which used the melody of Berry 's " Sweet Little Sixteen " . In 1964 and 1965 Berry released eight singles , including three that were commercially <unk> , reaching the top 20 of the Billboard 100 : " No Particular Place to Go " ( a humorous reworking of " School Days " , concerning the introduction of seat belts in cars ) , " You Never Can Tell " , and the rocking " Nadine " . Between 1966 and 1969 Berry released five albums for Mercury Records , including his first live album , Live at Fillmore Auditorium , in which he was backed by the Steve Miller Band . 
 While this was not a successful period for studio work , Berry was still a top concert draw . In May 1964 , he had made a successful tour of the UK , but when he returned in January 1965 his behavior was erratic and moody , and his touring style of using unrehearsed local backing bands and a strict <unk> contract was earning him a reputation as a difficult and unexciting performer . He also played at large events in North America , such as the Schaefer Music Festival , in New York City 's Central Park in July 1969 , and the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival in October . 
 = = = Back to Chess : " My Ding @-@ a @-@ Ling " to White House concert ( 1970 – 1979 ) = = = 
 Berry returned to Chess from 1970 to 1973 . There were no hit singles from the 1970 album Back Home , but in 1972 Chess released a live recording of " My Ding @-@ a @-@ Ling " , a novelty song which he had recorded in a different version as " My Tambourine " on his 1968 LP From St. Louie to Frisco . The track became his only number @-@ one single . A live recording of " Reelin ' and Rockin ' " , issued as a followup single in the same year , was his last Top 40 hit in both the US and the UK . Both singles were included on the part @-@ live , part @-@ studio album The London Chuck Berry Sessions ( other albums of London sessions were recorded by Chess 's mainstay artists Muddy Waters and Howlin ' Wolf ) . Berry 's second tenure with Chess ended with the 1975 album Chuck Berry , after which he did not make a studio record until Rock It for Atco Records in 1979 , his last studio album to date . 
 In the 1970s Berry toured on the strength of his earlier successes . He was on the road for many years , carrying only his Gibson guitar , confident that he could hire a band that already knew his music no matter where he went . AllMusic said that in this period his " live performances became increasingly erratic , ... working with terrible backup bands and turning in sloppy , out @-@ of @-@ tune performances " which " tarnished his reputation with younger fans and oldtimers " alike . Among the many bandleaders performing a backup role with Berry were Bruce Springsteen and Steve Miller when each was just starting his career . Springsteen related in the documentary film Hail ! Hail ! Rock ' n ' Roll that Berry did not give the band a set list and expected the musicians to follow his lead after each guitar intro . Berry neither spoke to nor thanked the band after the show . Nevertheless , Springsteen backed Berry again when he appeared at the concert for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 . At the request of Jimmy Carter , Berry performed at the White House on June 1 , 1979 . 
 Berry 's touring style , traveling the " oldies " circuit in the 1970s ( often being paid in cash by local promoters ) added ammunition to the Internal Revenue Service 's accusations that Berry had evaded paying income taxes . Facing criminal sanction for the third time , Berry pled guilty to tax evasion and was sentenced to four months in prison and 1 @,@ 000 hours of community service — performing benefit concerts — in 1979 . 
 = = = Still on the road ( 1980 – 2014 ) = = = 
 Berry continued to play 70 to 100 one @-@ nighters per year in the 1980s , still traveling solo and requiring a local band to back him at each stop . In 1986 , Taylor Hackford made a documentary film , Hail ! Hail ! Rock ' n ' Roll , of a celebration concert for Berry 's sixtieth birthday , organized by Keith Richards . Eric Clapton , Etta James , Julian Lennon , Robert Cray and Linda Ronstadt , among others , appeared with Berry on stage and in the film . During the concert , Berry played a Gibson ES @-@ 355 , the luxury version of the ES @-@ 335 that he favored on his 1970s tours . Richards played a black Fender Telecaster Custom , Cray a Fender Stratocaster and Clapton a Gibson ES <unk> , the same model that Berry used on his early recordings . 
 In the late 1980s , Berry bought The Southern Air , a restaurant in Wentzville , Missouri . In 1990 he was sued by several women who claimed that he had installed a video camera in the ladies ' bathroom . Berry claimed that he had the camera installed to catch red @-@ handed a worker who was suspected of stealing from the restaurant . Though his guilt was never proved in court , Berry opted for a class action settlement with 59 women . His biographer , Bruce Pegg , estimated that it cost Berry over $ 1 @.@ 2 million plus legal fees . During this time Berry began using Wayne T. <unk> as his legal counsel . Reportedly , a police raid on his house found videotapes of women using the restroom , and one of the women was a minor . Also found in the raid were 62 grams of marijuana . Felony drug and child @-@ abuse charges were filed . In order to avoid the child @-@ abuse charges , Berry agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana . He was given a six @-@ month suspended jail sentence and two years ' unsupervised probation and was ordered to donate $ 5 @,@ 000 to a local hospital . 
 In November 2000 , Berry again faced legal charges when he was sued by his former pianist Johnnie Johnson , who claimed that he co @-@ wrote over 50 songs , including " No Particular Place to Go " , " Sweet Little Sixteen " and " Roll Over Beethoven " , that credit Berry alone . The case was dismissed when the judge ruled that too much time had passed since the songs were written . 
 In 2008 , Berry toured Europe , with stops in Sweden , Norway , Finland , the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , Ireland , Switzerland , Poland and Spain . In mid @-@ 2008 , he played at the Virgin Festival in Baltimore , Maryland . 
 During a concert on New Year 's Day 2011 in Chicago , Berry , suffering from exhaustion , passed out and had to be helped off stage . 
 Berry lives in Ladue , Missouri , approximately 10 miles west of St. Louis . Berry regularly performed one Wednesday each month at Blueberry Hill , a restaurant and bar located in the Delmar Loop neighborhood of St. Louis , from 1996 to 2014 .

 A pioneer of rock and roll , Berry was a significant influence on the development of both the music and the attitude associated with the rock music lifestyle . With songs such as " Maybellene " ( 1955 ) , " Roll Over Beethoven " ( 1956 ) , " Rock and Roll Music " ( 1957 ) and " Johnny B. Goode " ( 1958 ) , Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive , with lyrics successfully aimed to appeal to the early teenage market by using graphic and humorous descriptions of teen dances , fast cars , high @-@ school life , and consumer culture , and utilizing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music . His records are a rich storehouse of the essential lyrical , showmanship and musical components of rock and roll . In addition to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , a large number of significant popular @-@ music performers have recorded Berry 's songs . Though not technically accomplished , his guitar style is distinctive — he incorporated electronic effects to mimic the sound of bottleneck blues guitarists and drew on the influence of guitar players such as Carl Hogan , and T @-@ Bone Walker to produce a clear and exciting sound that many later guitarists would acknowledge as an influence in their own style . Berry 's showmanship has been influential on other rock guitarists , particularly his one @-@ legged hop routine , and the " duck walk " , which he first used as a child when he walked " stooping with full @-@ bended knees , but with my back and head vertical " under a table to retrieve a ball and his family found it entertaining ; he used it when " performing in New York for the first time and some journalist branded it the duck walk . " 
 The rock critic Robert Christgau considers Berry " the greatest of the rock and rollers , " while John Lennon said , " if you tried to give rock and roll another name , you might call it ' Chuck Berry ' . " Ted Nugent said , " If you don 't know every Chuck Berry lick , you can 't play rock guitar . " 
 Among the honors Berry has received are the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1984 and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2000 . He was ranked seventh on Time magazine 's 2009 list of the 10 best electric guitar players of all time . On May 14 , 2002 , Berry was honored as one of the first BMI Icons at the 50th annual BMI Pop Awards . He was presented the award along with BMI affiliates Bo Diddley and Little Richard . In August 2014 , Berry was made a laureate of the Polar Music Prize . 
 Berry is included in several of Rolling Stone magazine 's " Greatest of All Time " lists . In September 2003 , the magazine ranked him number 6 in its list of the " 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time " . In November his compilation album The Great Twenty @-@ Eight was ranked 21st in Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . In March 2004 , Berry was ranked fifth on the list of " The Immortals – The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time " . In December 2004 , six of his songs were included in " Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " : " Johnny B. Goode " ( # 7 ) , " Maybellene " ( # 18 ) , " Roll Over Beethoven " ( # 97 ) , " Rock and Roll Music " ( # 128 ) , " Sweet Little Sixteen " ( # 272 ) and " Brown Eyed Handsome Man " ( # 374 ) . In June 2008 , his song " Johnny B. Goode " ranked first in the " 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time " . 
 The journalist Chuck Klosterman has argued that in 300 years Berry will still be remembered as the rock musician who most closely captured the essence of rock and roll .

 Interstate 69 ( I @-@ 69 ) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that will eventually run from the Mexican border in Texas to the Canadian border at Port Huron , Michigan . In Michigan , it is a state trunkline highway that enters the state south of Coldwater and passes the cities of Lansing and Flint in the Lower Peninsula . A north – south freeway from the Indiana – Michigan border to the Lansing area , it changes direction to east – west after running concurrently with I @-@ 96 . The freeway continues to Port Huron before terminating in the middle of the twin @-@ span Blue Water Bridge while running concurrently with I @-@ 94 at the border .

 Predecessors to I @-@ 69 include the first M @-@ 29 , US Highway 27 ( US 27 ) , M @-@ 78 and M @-@ 21 . The freeway was not included on the original Interstate Highway System planning maps in the mid @-@ 1950s , but it was added in 1958 along a shorter route . Michigan built segments of freeway for the future Interstate in the 1960s , and the state was granted additional Interstate mileage in 1968 to extend I @-@ 69 north and east to Flint . Later extensions in 1973 and 1987 resulted in the modern highway . The first freeway segment designated as I @-@ 69 in Michigan opened in 1967 , and the last was completed in 1992 , finishing Michigan 's Interstate System . US 27 previously ran concurrently with I @-@ 69 from the Indiana – Michigan state line north to the Lansing area , but this designation was removed in 2002 .

On the south side of Charlotte , I @-@ 69 turns northward , traversing an area to the east of downtown and crossing the former routing of US 27 , which is now part of the business loop for the city . Farther north , the freeway has a junction with M @-@ 50 , a bridge over the Battle Creek River , and an interchange with the northern end of the business loop next to Fitch H. Beach Airport . North of the airport , I @-@ 69 turns northeasterly again and parallels Lansing Road , the former route of US 27 / M @-@ 78 . The freeway meets the southern end of M @-@ 100 near Potterville and continues into the Lansing – East Lansing metropolitan area .

 At Durand , I @-@ 69 meets the southeastern end of M @-@ 71 on the northwest side of town . The freeway turns sharply to the northeast before turning due east near Lennon . The interchange with M @-@ 13 south of Lennon marks the Shiawassee – Genesee county line . Continuing eastward , I @-@ 69 parallels Miller Road to the north as far as the city of Swartz Creek ; east of town , the two roadways cross . I @-@ 69 parallels a line of the Canadian National Railway as it enters the Flint metro area . The freeway intersects Bristol Road near the Bishop International Airport and then crosses I @-@ 75 / US 23 southwest of downtown Flint . I @-@ 69 , the railroad and the Swartz Creek all parallel into downtown Flint where the freeway intersects I @-@ 475 and M @-@ 54 ( Dort Highway ) before exiting the east side of the city . 
 I @-@ 69 runs eastward out of Flint parallel to the railroad . At Davison , it intersects M @-@ 15 before crossing into Lapeer County . In this area , the freeway traverses farmlands in the southern part of the region called The Thumb . It jogs to the north around Lake <unk> , which is southwest of Lapeer . The freeway continues through farmland to Imlay City , where it meets M @-@ 53 before crossing into western St. Clair County . Southwest of Capac , there is a temporary welcome center at the rest area along the westbound lanes . I @-@ 69 continues eastward through an interchange with M @-@ 19 at Emmett . 
 Near Wadhams , I @-@ 69 curves around to the north to follow part of the Black River . On the east side of the community , the freeway turns back to the southeast as it enters the western edge of the Port Huron suburbs . I @-@ 69 turns again to run due eastward to intersect I @-@ 94 . The two freeways merge in an interchange that also has connections to BL I @-@ 69 . Past the interchange , the freeway curves to the north and back around to the east to cross the Black River . On the eastern bank , I @-@ 94 / I @-@ 69 travels through one more interchange , this one for M @-@ 25 and BL I @-@ 69 / BL I @-@ 94 . Past the interchange , the freeway crosses through the toll and customs plazas for the twin @-@ span Blue Water Bridge . The I @-@ 69 designation officially ends at the international boundary in the middle of the St. Clair River where it connects with Highway 402 .

 = = = Predecessor highways = = = 
 The first major overland transportation corridors in the future state of Michigan were the Indian trails . None of these followed the path of the modern I @-@ 69 however . The State Trunkline Highway System was created on May 13 , 1913 , by an act of the Michigan Legislature ; at the time , none of the system 's divisions corresponded to the modern I @-@ 69 either . In 1919 , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) was required to signpost the highway system for the first time , and the state become the second after Wisconsin to do so . At the time , two different highways followed sections of the modern I @-@ 69 corridor . The original M @-@ 29 ran from the Indiana state line north to Charlotte and turned northeasterly to Lansing . The second highway was M @-@ 21 from Flint east to Goodells , a community west of Port Huron ; the highway was extended to Port Huron by 1924 . 
 On November 11 , 1926 , the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) , and the new US 27 replaced M @-@ 29 from the state line northward to Lansing . By the end of the next year , M @-@ 78 was extended from Charlotte north and east of Lansing to a junction with M @-@ 47 near Pittsburg , north of the modern I @-@ 69 . The section of M @-@ 78 north of Lansing was changed in 1929 ; the segment from Dewitt to Pittsburg was redesignated M @-@ 104 , and M @-@ 78 was rerouted along a more southerly path through East Lansing to Haslett . By 1936 , M @-@ 78 was extended from Haslett all the way into Flint to end at M @-@ 21 . The first span of the Blue Water Bridge opened between Port Huron and Point Edward , Ontario , in 1938 . 
 = = = Interstate Highway era = = = 
 The first planning maps from 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System did not include a highway along I @-@ 69 's route ; instead a highway further west connecting South Bend , Indiana , with Kalamazoo was included . This alternative highway was maintained on the 1955 plan for the " National System of Interstate and Defense Highways " , and numbered I @-@ 67 in August 1957 . By June 1958 , this freeway had been shifted further east and renumbered I @-@ 69 , connecting Indianapolis , Indiana , with Marshall ; no connections north and east to Lansing , Flint or Port Huron were planned as part of the Interstate Highway System . Around the same time , a section of M @-@ 146 near Port Huron was converted into an approach freeway for the Blue Water Bridge . 
 By the middle of 1960 , the first section of freeway along M @-@ 78 was opened in the Lennon area . The next year , the freeway had been extended as far southwest as Durand from the end at Lennon . Also in 1961 , the MSHD had proposed that the section of US 27 south of Lansing be built as an electronic highway under a bid through General Motors ; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead . 
 By the start of 1962 , M @-@ 78 was a freeway from Perry at the junction with M @-@ 47 all the way to Swartz Creek near Flint . On December 12 , 1962 , I @-@ 96 was completed around the Lansing area , and M @-@ 78 was rerouted to follow it . A year later , I @-@ 496 was partially opened through the Lansing area , and M @-@ 78 was routed to follow it as well ; the former route through downtown was redesignated Business M @-@ 78 ( Bus . M @-@ 78 ) . Around the same time , I @-@ 94 was extended along the Blue Water Bridge approach freeway . 
 The first freeway segment of M @-@ 21 on the east end was built from Wadhams to Port Huron in 1966 . The next year , M @-@ 78 's freeway was extended eastward to I @-@ 75 / US 10 / US 23 in Flint . On October 11 , 1967 , the first segment of I @-@ 69 / US 27 was scheduled to open between the Indiana state line and Tekonsha . By the end of the year , the freeway extended north to I @-@ 94 northwest of Marshall . The MSHD requested additional Interstate Highway mileage in 1968 under the Federal @-@ Aid Highway Act of 1968 including an extension of I @-@ 69 from Marshall to Port Huron ; this extension was approved as far as I @-@ 75 / US 23 in Flint on December 13 , 1968 . 
 A discontinuous section of M @-@ 78 freeway east of Flint was completed in 1969 . The same year , I @-@ 475 was named the David Dunbar Buick Freeway , after the founder of Buick Motor Company in Flint ; the same legislation , House Concurrent Resolution 22 of 1969 named the M @-@ 78 freeway through Flint for Louis Chevrolet . In 1970 , the I @-@ 496 freeway was completed and the Bus . M @-@ 78 designation was removed through Lansing . A freeway segment between Flint and Lapeer opened in 1971 . M @-@ 21 was routed down M @-@ 13 to the new freeway where it joined the M @-@ 78 designation from M @-@ 13 east . The section of M @-@ 21 formerly between M @-@ 13 and Bus . M @-@ 54 was redesignated M @-@ 56 . The M @-@ 78 designation was replaced by I @-@ 69 in 1973 after a Temporary I @-@ 69 ( Temp . I @-@ 69 ) designation was extended northward from Charlotte through Lansing to Perry . On September 4 of that year , I @-@ 69 's designation was officially extended by Congress to end at I @-@ 475 on the east side of Flint ; this extension , and all subsequent ones , was of non @-@ chargeable mileage , or segments not financed through the Interstate Highway fund . 
 In 1980 , a Flint @-@ area politician wanted to dedicate a highway after the United Auto Workers ( UAW ) . As a result , the David Dunbar Buick Freeway name was moved off I @-@ 475 and applied to I @-@ 69 in Flint . The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) approved the extension of the I @-@ 69 designation eastward in 1983 so that it would terminate at the international boundary at Port Huron ; this approval was contingent on construction of the roadway to Interstate Highway standards and other appropriate approvals at the federal government level . The remaining segment of freeway connecting Lapeer with Wadhams opened in 1984 as I @-@ 69 and several additional changes were made to the highway system at the same time . M @-@ 21 was shortened to Flint and replaced M @-@ 56 through the city . The former route of M @-@ 21 in Port Huron became BL I @-@ 69 , and the remainder of that highway was turned back to local control . The I @-@ 69 designation was officially extended once more under Congressional legislation on February 10 , 1987 ; this last extension designated I @-@ 69 all the way to I @-@ 94 in Port Huron to reflect the 1984 openings . 
 Another segment of freeway opened in 1987 in Clinton County between US 127 near DeWitt and Temp . I @-@ 69 near Bath . This section was connected to the existing freeway at Perry in 1991 . The final segment of I @-@ 69 to be completed was located southwest of Lansing . It opened on October 17 , 1992 , when the ribbon was cut by Governor John Engler . This segment marked the last in the state to complete Michigan 's portion of the Interstate Highway System . At the time it was completed , I @-@ 69 was concurrent with US 27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area ( exit 87 ) and then concurrent with US 127 to exit 89 before running alone to Port Huron . 
 = = = Since completion = = = 
 A second span of the Blue Water Bridge between Port Huron and Point Edward opened in July 1997 . The St. Johns Bypass on US 27 opened on August 31 , 1998 ; US 27 was extended along I @-@ 69 about two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) to the connect to the bypass , and US 127 was simultaneously removed from I @-@ 69 . The next year , MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US 27 designation in the state ; the change was approved on April 16 , 1999 . The state waited until 2002 to make the change . 
 On July 23 , 2001 , the Michigan Legislature declared that I @-@ 69 from exit 105 in Shiawassee County east to exit 135 in Genesee County would be named the Pearl Harbor Memorial Highway . In October 2001 , the legislature consolidated the various legislation that created memorial highway designations in the state . Public Act 142 of 2001 extended the merged Chevrolet – Buick Freeway name to all of I @-@ 69 in Genesee County , and restored the David Dunbar Buick Freeway name to I @-@ 475 . The I @-@ 69 Recreational Heritage Route ( now a Pure Michigan Byway ) was created on October 8 , 2004 , to follow the freeway in Branch and Calhoun counties . The Branch County segment was also dedicated as the Purple Heart Trail on July 17 , 2006 . 
 In 2011 , construction began to widen I @-@ 94 / I @-@ 69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge , a project completed in 2012 . The widening project added dedicated lanes for local traffic and for Blue Water Bridge traffic with a new permanent welcome center expected to open in 2015 , replacing the temporary one near Capac . The lane configuration changes have confused drivers in the area , especially those with outdated GPS devices , a problem first noted as the department was preparing to reopen the freeway in October 2012 . As a result , MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake . 
 In late 2013 , construction began to reconstruct and reconfigure the I @-@ 94 / I @-@ 69 interchange near Port Huron . The project will improve 3 @.@ 7 miles ( 6 @.@ 0 km ) of freeway , replace several bridges and ramps and cost $ 76 million . In June 2014 , MDOT closed the ramps from I @-@ 69 eastbound to BL I @-@ 69 through the interchange until later in the year . The project is slated to be completed in 2015 .

 Ranch to Market Road 187 ( RM 187 ) is a 81 @.@ 9 @-@ mile ( 131 @.@ 8 km ) Ranch to Market Road located in Zavala , Uvalde , Bandera , and Kerr counties in the US state of Texas . The route passes through the cities of Sabinal , Utopia , and Vanderpool . The road helps connect several small south Texas ranches to major highways . RM 187 was first designated in 1945 , and was extended three times during the 1940s . As of 2012 , it is the longest Ranch to Market Road in the state of Texas .

 RM 187 begins at its southern terminus with US Highway 57 ( US 57 ) , near Batesville , as a paved , two @-@ lane , asphalt road . RM 187 winds through several miles of Southern Texas grassland dotted with trees . The highway passes several large ranches and farms along this course and intersects with several county routes and private roads . For this stretch of the route , RM 187 is heading in a northeast direction . The highway turns north about two miles ( 3 km ) south of an intersection with FM 140 . The two highways run concurrently for nearly a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) before FM 140 turns westward . RM 187 continues north through rolling grasslands for almost 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) before turning in a northeast direction . The route continues in this direction for about two miles before returning to a northerly direction . After about 15 miles ( 24 km ) , RM 187 intersects with US 90 and State Highway 127 ( SH 127 ) in the small town of Sabinal . The highway continues through more hilly , rolling grasslands . A few miles later , the highway crosses the Sabinal River and proceeds past the <unk> cemetery , the Links of Utopia Golf Course , and the Utopia on the River Airport before passing through the " downtown " area of the village of Utopia . 
 RM 187 winds through nearly seven miles ( 11 km ) of brushland , passing several large ranches and farms alongside the Sabinal River . The highway heads through the unincorporated community of Vanderpool and runs concurrently with RM 337 for a length of 1 @.@ 1 miles ( 1 @.@ 8 km ) . Separating and running northward , RM 187 continues along the southwestern edge of the Lost Maples State Natural Area . The highway turns northeasterly through a long stretch of brushland before reaching its northern terminus at SH 39 .

 RM 187 was first designated as a stretch of road going from Sabinal to the Bandera County line on June 11 , 1945 . Just 14 days later , on June 25 , 1945 , it was extended from the Bandera County line up to Vanderpool . The highway was extended from an intersection with US 90 to Garner Field on April 1 , 1948 , which added approximately 1 @.@ 8 miles ( 2 @.@ 9 km ) to the route . The highway was lengthened on November 23 , 1948 to a point 4 @.@ 3 miles ( 6 @.@ 9 km ) south of Sabinal , while the previous extension was cancelled and redesignated to FM 1023 . The highway was again lengthened southward by 6 @.@ 7 miles ( 10 @.@ 8 km ) to a dead end point on July 15 , 1949 . RM 187 was again extended south on March 24 , 1954 to an intersection with FM 140 . This added approximately 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) , giving the route an overall length of 48 miles . On May 2 , 1962 , the road was extended 4 @.@ 5 miles ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) northward , totaling 52 @.@ 5 miles ( 84 @.@ 5 km ) long . RM 187 was extended to its modern @-@ day northern terminus at SH 39 on June 26 , 1963 , which added about 12 @.@ 9 miles ( 20 @.@ 8 km ) to the route . On June 2 , 1967 , FM 2557 was redesignated to RM 187 , bringing the route to its southern terminus US 57 . This added approximately 5 miles ( 8 km ) .

 The Roseland Theater , sometimes called the Roseland Theater and Grill , is a music venue located at 8 Northwest Sixth Avenue in the Old Town Chinatown neighborhood of Portland , Oregon , in the United States . The building was originally a church , constructed by the Apostolic Faith Church in 1922 . In 1982 , Larry Hurwitz converted the building to a music venue called Starry Night . In 1990 , the club 's 21 @-@ year @-@ old publicity agent was murdered in one of the theater 's hallways ; Hurwitz was convicted for this murder ten years later . Hurwitz sold the club in 1991 , claiming he had lost support from the local music industry . The venue was given its current name during the 1991 ownership transfer . During the 1990s , Double Tee acquired control of the hall 's operations , then purchased and renovated the building . 
 The theater features a standing @-@ only main floor and an upstairs balcony with an adjacent bar . Peter 's Room , an intimate showcase venue with a 400 @-@ person capacity , includes a restaurant and bar .

 The Apostolic Faith Church bought the property at 8 Northwest Sixth Avenue from the A. Meier estate in 1922 and immediately began constructing a two @-@ story building at the site . To make way for the new structure , church members first razed an older building that had housed a saloon at that address . The new building was finished in August 1922 . 
 Made of brick and constructed entirely with donated labor , the structure had a footprint of 100 by 100 feet ( 30 by 30 m ) next to a 60 @-@ by @-@ 100 @-@ foot ( 18 by 30 m ) parking lot . The lower floor contained 11 storerooms , some of which were rented to others , a printing room , the church headquarters , and a small chapel with a seating capacity of 200 . The upper floor consisted of a large meeting hall that could seat 1 @,@ 150 people . The meeting hall was designed partly with music in mind . Its raised platform held up to 70 people , including a 40 @-@ piece orchestra and male and mixed quartets that performed during church services . The church sold the building in 1981 . A neon sign reading " Jesus , the Light of the World " , hung on the building but was removed in 1981 .

Hurwitz sold the Starry Night in February 1991 , claiming he had " lost the support of the local music industry " . The transfer in ownership resulted in a name change to Roseland Theater . In 1992 , Roseland 's manager for the new owners , Oregon Theater Management , said the name was changed to disassociate from Hurwitz 's business and reputation .

After the murder , Hurwitz moved to Vietnam , but in 1997 a federal grand jury indicted him on charges of tax evasion related to the scam . <unk> to the United States and pleading guilty to the tax evasion charges , he was sentenced to a year in federal prison . Publicity generated by the tax @-@ evasion trial led to new information about the murder . Sentenced to 11 years in prison after pleading no contest to one count of murder in 2000 , Hurwitz was released in 2008 after serving between 7 and 8 years . Meanwhile , to settle a civil wrongful @-@ death suit filed against him by Moreau 's parents , Hurwitz in 2001 stipulated to his part in the murder , agreed that a jury would have found him guilty if he had not pleaded " no contest " , and agreed to pay the Moreau family $ 3 million in damages .

 In 1991 , Double Tee Promotions acquired control of Roseland 's operations . In December 1995 , The Oregonian reported that the company and its president , David Leiken , would be purchasing and renovating the building over several months .

The project , which included purchase of the building , new lounges and restrooms , and a ventilation system , was estimated to cost between $ 1 @.@ 75 million and $ 2 million . The size of the street @-@ level floor would also increased to accommodate an additional 350 – 440 guests , replacing a small club called the Garden . The renovation project ended in 1997 ; Leiken updated the building 's facade and opened a nightclub and sports bar on the lower level . Roseland remained open during the renovation , which reportedly cost around $ 2 @.@ 5 million . 
 Roseland Theater has been called a " somewhat chaotic " Portland staple , hosting " multi @-@ generational concerts every night of the week by everyone from small local bands to huge national icons " .

 = Mya ( program ) = 
 Mya was an intelligent personal assistant under development by Motorola . Proposed features for the program included the ability to read emails and answer questions 24 hours a day . Mya was intended to work with an internet service Motorola was developing called Myosphere , and was planned to be a paid service that would eventually be used by other mobile carriers . A female computer @-@ generated character was created to represent Mya in advertising . While the quality of the character 's animation was praised , it received criticism for being over sexualised . 
 Both the character and the program were announced to the public via an advertisement in March 2000 , though the program was not ready for use at that time . Despite the announcement generating a considerable amount of attention , little was heard regarding the project in subsequent months . The program was never officially released nor cancelled , though the trademarks for both Myosphere and Mya were abandoned by Motorola in 2002 . The name Mya was believed to be a play on the words ' My assistant ' . 
 = = Proposed features and development = = 
 The Internet service that Mya was developed for was called Myosphere . Motorola began development of Myosphere in 1998 , and it had been described as a speech enabled service " which enables consumers to manage and control wireless and wireline communications from a single point of access using natural voice commands . " Several other companies had already announced plans for similar software at the time ; Alan Reiter from Wireless Internet and Mobile Computing was puzzled at Motorola 's announcement of Myosphere , saying " They 're kind of late to the [ voice activation ] party . But the party is likely to be very big . ... Motorola 's entry will help further legitimize the value of voice response systems . But it 's a tough market , and it will take time . " The term <unk> was " a play on the theme of connecting the elements of an individual 's world , or sphere . " 
 Intended to provide a human @-@ like interface to the Internet , Mya was to be accessed via a toll @-@ free telephone number and a pin code . The program was designed to work with any phone , including landlines , but primarily for mobiles , and was to be accessible 24 hours a day . Mya was said to be able to answer questions on topics such as stock prices , news , sports , weather conditions , traffic , airline reservations , addresses , and appointments , as well as being able to call contacts in a mobile phone 's address book . 
 Intended to be a paid service that would be ready by December 2000 , Motorola hoped that Mya would also eventually be used on Palm Pilot and by other mobile carriers . In July 2000 Motorola was reported to be planning to work with Nuance Communications to internationalize Mya , and that same month BellSouth was declared to be the first carrier to buy the service . According to an article in Popular Science in August 2000 , Motorola was spending " millions of dollars " on both the Mya character and the program . Mya was originally programmed only for English , though by April 2001 the program was being developed in six languages , and additionally Nippon Telegraph and Telephone were said to be working with Motorola to develop a Japanese version . Mya was voiced by actress Gabrielle <unk> , and mechanically altered to sound more digital . 
 = = Character = = 
 To create a commercial for Mya , Motorola hired the McCann Erickson company , who in turn hired Digital Domain to create the character . The design was described as a " big @-@ budget " production , though Digital Domain were only given three months to complete the project . Mya 's physical representation : a tall , thin , blonde , blue @-@ eyed white female , was created in the likeness of a human model , Michelle Holgate . The initial inspiration for Mya came from vintage pin @-@ up girls . The first representation of Mya had a very small waist and large breasts , and was said to resemble Jessica Rabbit , which did not impress either Motorola or McCann Erickson . Motorola asked Digital Domain to make Mya look as human as possible yet still be obviously artificial . The first completed iteration of Mya was so realistic that Motorola asked for her to be made more obviously digital . Viewers were reportedly not impressed with Mya because they thought she was a real person . Digital Domain visual effects supervisor and animation director , Fred Raimondi , decided to remodel Mya 's appearance to be " just to the left of real " . 
 You know how when you first looked at Max Headroom and were like ' What is that ? ' That 's [ the effect ] we were after . 
 Mya 's hair was changed from brunette to bleach blonde . Her short spiky hair style was said to resemble that of Serena Altschul . According to Digital Domain , giving Mya hair that was longer than ear @-@ length was not possible in the time they had been given , due to the difficulties of creating digital photorealistic hair . Mya 's final body shape was an almost exact copy of the original model 's measurements . Mya was typically seen wearing a silver pantsuit but also appeared in halter tops in some shots and dressed in an evening gown for her debut . While Digital Domain staff wanted Mya to appear in a knee @-@ length skirt with high boots , Motorola and McCann chose the pantsuit , due to its contemporary look . 
 Digital Domain chose not to use motion capture for Mya 's movements as they believed it would constrain the character too much . Instead they used rotoscoping to place their digital character over the real model . The evening gown Motorola selected for Mya to debut in was described by Digital Domain as the most difficult item of clothing they could have chosen , due to its transparency and layering . To render 150 frames ( equating to 5 – 6 seconds of actual footage ) of Mya moving in the gown in low @-@ resolution required approximately 6 hours of processing time ; the final high @-@ resolution shots took longer . Mya 's rendering was so complex she crashed the computers at Digital Domain several times . Mya 's creators said they had difficulty making Mya appear as if she were " alive " , and focused intensely on movements , specular highlights and eye blinks in order to " bring her to life " . The specular highlights also had the intended effect of making Mya shine in an inhuman manner ; when the light hit Mya at certain angles , a rainbow would appear . Mya 's skin was described as " part china doll , part disco ball . " Her distinct shine was based on that of a china plate that the commercial 's director , Alex Proyas , had bought in Australia . In some shots of Mya , images were deliberately downgraded and had scan lines added to make the character appear more artificial . 
 Mya 's visual representation , however , appeared solely during advertising and on her website . Only her voice was to be heard when using the actual program . Demonstrations of Mya 's abilities and images of the character could be viewed at the now defunct website , <unk> Raimondi said he believed the name Mya was a play on the words ' My assistant ' , as did Sidney Matrix in the book <unk> : Digital Lifestyles and Commodity Culture . 
 = = Debut and appearances = = 
 Mya made her debut on March 26 , 2000 in an 60 @-@ second advertisement shown during the 72nd Academy Awards . The ad featured Mya dressed in her evening gown and wearing a headset . In the ad Mya steps out of a stretch limousine and walks down the red carpet for the show . The ad declared Mya to be " the darling of the e @-@ world , the 24 @-@ hour talking Internet " and stated that Mya 's abilities would change users ' lives . Despite making her first advertising appearance in March , the Mya program was not scheduled to be ready until December 2000 . 
 Mya subsequently received considerable media attention , and was featured on the front covers of USA Today , InStyle , Wired and <unk> . One promotion for Mya showed Hugh Hefner sitting in a limousine with two Playboy Bunnies , asking Mya to read him his emails . 
 The Mya program was on display at the Motorola wireless booth at COMDEX in April 2000 , which was visited by then president Bill Clinton . Mya " <unk> [ ed ] up halfway " through a demonstration for the president and had to be restarted . 
 In 2006 Sidney Matrix stated Mya " disappeared " after her debut commercial ; in August 2000 , a Yankee Group vice @-@ president stated the debut advertisement for Mya was a " great ad , but where have [ Motorola ] gone with it ? ... The spot drove viewers to its website to demo the product ... but failed to market Mya further . " Mya was never documented to have been released , nor was there an announcement of the program 's cancellation ; Motorola abandoned their trademark for ' Mya ' on September 19 , 2002 and their trademark for ' Myosphere ' on December 1 , 2002 .

 The reception of the character was mixed . Libby Callaway from New York Post stated Mya was one of their favourite " virtual babes " , and said she threatened to take Lara Croft 's title as the internet 's most popular pin @-@ up girl , also describing Mya as " the world 's first ' cyber assistant ' " . Whilst admitting that the character of Mya was visually appealing , John Sullivan of Wireless Insider also stated that Motorola " went overboard " by trying to give the Mya program a character in the hopes she would become a celebrity in her own right , and accused Motorola of trying to mimic the success of Lara Croft . Mya was described in the 2003 book Data Made Flesh : Embodying Information as " by far " the best @-@ rendered and most self @-@ assured digital woman . Noah Robischon from Entertainment Weekly called her debut the second creepiest moment at that year 's Academy Awards ( the first being Angelina Jolie kissing her brother ) . 
 Writing in Popular Mechanics , Tobey Grumet described Mya as a male @-@ chauvinistic creation , and she was cited in the 2006 book Physical Culture , Power , and the Body as an example of simulated sexualised females . Sidney Matrix stated that Mya 's seductive appearance and sultry voice " depended on , borrowed from and <unk> [ ed ] sexist stereotypes " , and accused Motorola of normalising the assumption that technology users are both male and heterosexual . Motorola 's marketing director Julie Roth defended the design of Mya 's appearance and voice , attributing it to market research of what would appeal to users . 
 Mya 's character was often compared to the female computer @-@ simulated character for <unk> , a web @-@ based news service that was being developed around the same time .

 Though Mya 's character was generally regarded as impressive , the underlying technology was described by Peggy Albright in Wireless Week as not surprising ; Albright said Motorola was " latest company in recent weeks to introduce a voice @-@ activated virtual assistant " , as Mya was announced shortly after Microsoft had announced their <unk> , and Lucent had launched their Mobile Voice Activated <unk> software . However , Tobey <unk> spoke highly of the program in anticipation of its release , and Mya was described by Elliot Drucker of Wireless Week as a solution to the limitations of accessing the Internet on a mobile phone , without a keyboard or large colour display . While regarding the program with interest , John Sullivan doubted that Mya would persuade people who were not already on the Internet to start using it , and stated that if Mya could only read emails and not actually converse with him , he would rather just read his emails himself . Dawn <unk> from the Orange County Register called Mya a " crude interpretation of things to come " , noting that speech technology at the time was not without its limitations .

 = New York State Route 221 = 
 New York State Route 221 ( NY 221 ) is a state highway in Cortland County , New York , in the United States . Its western terminus is at an intersection with NY 38 in the town of Harford . The eastern terminus is at a junction with NY 26 and NY 41 in the town of Willet . Near its western end , NY 221 intersects New York State Route 200 . Together , NY 200 and NY 221 form a loop route off NY 38 between the hamlets of Harford and Harford Mills within the town of Harford . NY 221 originally followed modern NY 200 and ended at U.S. Route 11 ( US 11 ) in Marathon when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . It was extended to its present length by the following year and realigned to serve Harford later in the decade . NY 200 was assigned in the 1940s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 221 begins at an intersection with NY 38 in the town of Harford . The route progresses northward through a small hamlet , crossing the Owego and Harford Railway and serving a mobile home park . At the intersection with Owego Hill Road , NY 221 turns eastward as a two @-@ lane road , where the route changes backdrops into a more rural and residential mix . After about a mile , the route intersects with NY 200 , a 1 @.@ 37 @-@ mile long ( 2 @.@ 20 km ) route that connects NY 221 back to NY 38 and the hamlet of Harford Mills . At this junction , NY 221 turns north once again , while NY 200 begins on the former right @-@ of @-@ way used by NY 221 . The surroundings remain the same as the route continues , turning to the northeast , and soon east at the junction at County Route 131 ( CR 131 ; Babcock Hollow Road ) . 
 The rural road bends to the southeast gradually , entering the town of Lapeer , turning east again until it meets CR 133 ( Clarks Corner Road ) . The highway soon reverts to a southeast direction , passing to the north of Beaver Pond and the county line , while NY 221 enters the hamlet of Hunts Corners and intersects with CR 136 ( Jennings Creek Road ) . Here , NY 221 changes direction again , following a northeasterly path out of the hamlet . It bypasses the nearby hamlet of Clarks Corner and soon intersects with the eastern terminus of CR 133 , which gives way to NY 221 as the state road merges with the east – west county highway . NY 221 continues on an eastward track into the town of Marathon , where it descends into the Tioughnioga River valley and enters the village of Marathon . 
 Within the village , the route gains the West Main Street moniker and heads through a mix of residential and commercial areas . NY 221 crosses intersections with CR <unk> and CR 134B and passes the former Marathon railroad depot before crossing the New York , Susquehanna and Western Railway and the Tioughnioga River in the center of the community . After crossing the river , the renamed Main Street heads northeast through the village , intersecting with US 11 ( Cortland Street ) just ahead of an interchange with Interstate 81 ( I @-@ 81 ) at the latter 's exit 9 . After the exit from I @-@ 81 , NY 221 reenters another rural area and turns eastward past Dean Pond . After intersecting with CR <unk> ( Texas Valley Road ) and CR <unk> ( Merrill Creek Road ) , NY 221 crosses Merrill Creek and winds through farmland . Entering the town of Willet , NY 221 crosses the southern terminus of CR 167 ( Bloody Pond Road ) and makes a gradual curve to the north while intersecting with CR 169 ( Landers Corners Road ) . NY 221 continues north to the hamlet of Willet , where it ends at an intersection with NY 26 and NY 41 . 
 = = History = = 
 The state of New York assumed maintenance of two highways linking the hamlets of Harford and Harford Mills — one directly connecting the two and a second , more circuitous route to the east — in the early 20th century . The direct route and most of the loop road were improved to state highway standards as part of a project contracted out on October 16 , 1914 , and were added to the state highway system on December 10 , 1915 , as State Highway 1075 ( SH 1075 ) . Each end of SH 1075 connected to the segment of the loop route between modern NY 38 and Owego Hill Road , which was rebuilt as part of an earlier project awarded on September 19 , 1906 , and included in the state highway system on July 5 , 1908 , as SH 379 . Both designations are unsigned and used only for inventory purposes . 
 In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the south half of the loop road became part of NY 221 , a new route extending from NY 38 at Harford Mills to US 11 in the village of Marathon . NY 221 was extended east to its current eastern terminus in Willet by the following year . The portion of the route between the Harford loop road and Willet utilized a highway added to the state highway system sometime after 1926 . NY 221 was rerouted to follow its current alignment to the hamlet of Harford in the mid @-@ 1930s , and its former routing to Harford Mills was redesignated as NY 200 in the 1940s .

 = Rail transport in Victoria = 
 Rail transport in Victoria , Australia , is provided by a number of railway operators who operate over the government @-@ owned railway lines . Victorian lines use 5 ft 3 in ( 1 @,@ 600 mm ) broad gauge , with the exception of a number of standard gauge 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 435 mm ) freight and interstate lines , a few experimental 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) narrow gauge lines , and various private logging , mining and industrial railways . 
 Railways were privately owned and operated , until the State Government established the vertically integrated Victorian Railways in 1883 . This remained until <unk> occurred in the 1980s , followed by privatisation in the 1990s . Passenger services today are operated by Metro Trains Melbourne in suburban Melbourne with electric multiple units , and V / Line in regional Victoria with diesel trains . Freight services are operated by <unk> ( interstate ) , Pacific National and SCT Logistics ( interstate and intrastate ) , and <unk> Logistics and <unk> ( intrastate ) . 
 The rail network radiates from the state capital , Melbourne , with main interstate links to Sydney and to Adelaide , as well as major lines running to regional centres , upgraded as part of the Regional Fast Rail project . The rail network reached a peak in 1942 but steadily declined , as branch and cross country lines were closed up to the 1980s . 
 Victoria does not have a dominant mining base as with other states , and has traditionally been more dependent on agriculture for rail freight traffic . By the 1990s road transport had captured most general freight traffic , with an average of only 6 @.@ 1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried each year between 1996 and 1998 ; containers being the major cargo , followed by cement , logs , quarry products and steel .

 Australia 's first steam operated railway was a 2 1 ⁄ 2 mi ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) Victorian broad gauge line between the Melbourne ( or City ) Terminus ( on the site of modern @-@ day Flinders Street Station ) and Sandridge ( now Port Melbourne ) , constructed by the Melbourne and Hobson 's Bay Railway Company and opened in September 1854 . The first country line in Victoria was from Melbourne to Geelong , opened in 1857 by the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company . The early years saw the of lines being constructed by private companies , this not changing until the 1870s when the Government Railway Department ( Victorian Railways ) had built their own lines . 
 The suburban network expanded to the east from Princes Bridge railway station to Richmond in 1859 , then later to Brighton and Hawthorn by the early <unk> the initial suburban lines were all built by different private companies centred upon Flinders St , being amalgamated into the Melbourne and Hobson 's Bay United Railway Company by 1865 , with public ownership not coming until 1878 . In 1862 Victorian Railways lines had reached the great gold rush towns of Bendigo and Ballarat , and in 1864 railways were extended to the Murray River port of Echuca . 
 In 1883 the first connection to another State 's rail system was made , when the Albury @-@ Wodonga line was completed to the New South Wales Government Railways ' station at Albury , requiring a break @-@ of @-@ gauge to New South Wales ' 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 435 mm ) ( standard gauge ) . It was then followed in 1887 by a connection with the broad gauge South Australian Railways at <unk> , with the Intercolonial Express ( now The Overland ) to Adelaide running between the capitals . Additional trunk lines were also built though the 1870s , with rails extended to Sale , Portland and Colac ; and the first branch lines built . It was a time of improved train safety , with the first interlocking of railway signalling to protect trains provided in 1874 , and tests of continuous train brakes carried out in 1884 . 
 In 1884 State Parliament passed The Railway Construction Act , which authorised fifty @-@ nine new lines to almost every corner of the state , and thus became known as the Octopus Act . The proposed lines would serve both new agricultural communities and support suburban land speculation . It was also this decade that the first narrow gauge line was opened from Wangaratta to Whitfield , with three other lines following by 1910 . The South Gippsland line was also opened from Dandenong to Leongatha by 1891 . However , by the late 1890s the majority of the state was now covered in railways , with the exception of the Mallee country in the north west of the state which saw further line openings , such as the Mildura line in 1903 .

 In 1907 the A2 class steam locomotive was introduced . There were 185 locomotives in this class and they were Victorian Railway 's main passenger locomotive until the arrival of the diesel electric B class in 1952 . On 20 April 1908 the Sunshine train disaster occurred , killing 44 passengers in the worst Victorian railway accident . 
 Electrification of the Melbourne suburban network was also carried out , with the first train running in 1919 . By 1924 210 @,@ 000 passengers passed through the main city terminal of Flinders Street Station per weekday . St Kilda was Melbourne 's busiest suburban station with 4 ½ million journeys , followed by Footscray with almost 4 million , then Elsternwick , Ascot Vale , Essendon and Balaclava . Technology advancements continued , with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915 , the conversion of screw couplings to knuckle couplers from 1924 , and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925 . The first level crossing flashing lights were installed at Mentone on <unk> Road in 1932 . 
 Despite the World War I , significant extensions of rail lines were carried out , particularly in the wheat growing areas in the north west and west . The new lengthy parallel lines were considered to be cheaper to operate than the numerous short spurs such as those in the Goulburn Valley . By 1930 the railway map of Victoria was largely complete , with the best land settled and the remaining land marginal for agriculture , with a number of lines built across the state border into the Riverina of NSW . On November 1937 the first run of the Spirit of Progress was made , a streamlined all air conditioned train run between Melbourne and Albury , led by the matching S class steam locomotives . 
 From 1924 to 1935 , the Better Farming Train made 38 tours promoting improved agricultural practices . 
 The Victorian Railways biggest steam locomotive H 220 Heavy Harry entered service in 1941 , at a time when the railways were struggling with the needs of the war effort . In 1943 the Victorian Railways employed 25 @,@ 450 , had 577 steam locos and 12 electric locos on register along with 19 @,@ 823 goods wagons and 1 @,@ 499 passenger cars , running along 4 @,@ 758 miles ( 7 @,@ 657 km ) of lines . The network reached its largest extent in 1942 , covering <unk> route kilometres .

 After World War II the railways were run down , with Operation Phoenix unveiled in 1950 , involving the expenditure of £ 80 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 over 10 years . Works included electrification to Traralgon , new Harris suburban trains , the Walker railmotors , and approximately 3 @,@ 000 new goods wagons . 
 On 14 July 1952 the VR entered the diesel era , with the delivery of the first B class mainline locomotive , with the commissioning of the first mainline electrification scheme in Australia in July 1954 to <unk> . March 1954 saw Queen Elizabeth II tour Victoria by Royal Train , the first time a reigning monarch had travelled on the VR , 1954 also saw the last steam locomotive to enter service , J class 559 , as well as the last four wheeled open wagons being built . The fifties also saw the loss of a number of short branch lines , particularly country where the only traffic had been timber or livestock . 
 In the 1960s the break of gauge at Albury was eliminated , with the opening of the North East standard gauge line in 1962 . The new line aided freight traffic between the state capitals , and enabled though passenger trains , such as the Southern Aurora and the <unk> Daylight . At the same time the sixties was also the end of steam , with the demolition of the massive North Melbourne Locomotive Depot on 20 January 1961 . 
 1965 saw the Victorian Railways produce a £ 193 @,@ 727 surplus , but by 1973 increasing costs and declining revenue resulted in a $ 86 @,@ 086 @,@ 361 deficit . On 20 July 1976 the Laverton derailment occurred , killing one passenger , in what was the last railway passenger fatality not involving a road vehicle . By the late seventies roadside goods and country railmotor services had been replaced by road transport , and branch lines outside the grain producing areas were now virtually non @-@ existent . The <unk> Report delivered in 1980 recommended the closure of all country passenger service except that to Geelong , elimination of a number of suburban railways , and moving small @-@ volume freight from rail to road .

 The 1980s saw <unk> of the Victorian Railways carried out , with the railway commissioners replaced by VicRail and later government authorities . New liveries on trains were unveiled , as elderly " red <unk> " were replaced by new trains . 
 1981 saw the Melbourne underground loop open in January , followed by the new air conditioned <unk> suburban trains and " N " type country passenger carriages in September the same year . Country services were also sped up under the New Deal by the closure of 35 of small wayside stations . Country passenger services saw the last of the non @-@ air @-@ conditioned wooden bodied passenger cars withdrawn from service in 1986 , replaced by new " H " set carriages . Trials were also carried out for further upgrades , with locomotive <unk> re @-@ geared for 160 km / h operation in a series of test runs between Glenorchy and Lubeck in the state 's west in July 1986 . 
 It was also the end of an era , with freight trains having their guards vans and guards abolished from 1985 , and the carriage of livestock ended in 1986 . The last run of the Spirit of Progress and Southern Aurora passenger trains were also made in 1986 , on 3 August . Working practices were also altered , with through working of C class locomotives introduced between Melbourne and Adelaide in 1982 . Previously Victorian locomotives were detached at the state borders , and replaced by locomotives from the next state . New locomotive were also introduced , with the G class and N classes enabling the retirement of many of the 1st generation diesels . 
 Cuts continued to the rail network , with larger centralised silos in the north western area of the state , and replacement of traditional safeworking systems by systems that required no local staff saw further stations de @-@ manned .

 The 1990s saw costs further reduced on the rail network . Guards were removed from passenger trains in 1989 , and driver only suburban trains commenced running in 1993 , with the last suburban train crewed by a guard running in November 1995 . In 1994 the National Rail Corporation was established , taking profitable steel , and intermodal <unk> from V / Line ; and the Melbourne to Adelaide standard gauge line was opened in 1995 moving the break of gauge . 
 Moves towards privatisation begun in 1997 , with V / Line split into V / Line Passenger and V / Line Freight by Bayside Trains and Hillside Trains being separated from the Public Transport Corporation in 1998 . V / Line Freight was sold to Rail America , known as Freight Victoria in 1999 , followed by National Express taking over Bayside Trains and V / Line Passenger in 2000 , with Connex Melbourne taking over Hillside Trains .

 Victorian Premier Steve Bracks negotiated a premature end to the " under @-@ rail " Victorian country Broad Gauge network lease just minutes before the caretaker mode began before the state election of November 2006 . This cost around $ 125 million . 
 In May 2008 the then Premier John Brumby arranged a 45 @-@ year lease to the <unk> of the single track Seymour @-@ Albury section . Part of the negotiation involved Victoria contributing money for the track to be upgraded and standardised and for Wodonga to be bypassed . 
 Today , the state consists of four networks : the electrified metropolitan system operated by Metro Trains Melbourne , the country passenger network operated by V / Line and upgraded as part of the Regional Fast Rail project , the standard gauge interstate lines to Adelaide and Sydney , and the grain network in the north west of the state , connected to the ports at Geelong and Portland .

 The trunk railway lines of Victoria are double track , some built as such , and others duplicated later on . Early sections of the suburban network were double track , with later additions being single track that were later duplicated . 
 The Bendigo and Geelong – Ballarat mainlines were both built as double track in the 1860s , but were singled in the 1930s and first decade of the 21st century respectively . The north @-@ east line to Seymour was duplicated in the mid @-@ 1880s and remains so today , the Gippsland line to Moe was duplicated in the 1950s in conjunction with increased <unk> traffic , and the busiest country line in the state to Geelong was progressively duplicated from 1959 to 1981 . 
 Few railway tunnels exist in Victoria , with the exception of the Melbourne City Loop . The longest tunnel before the opening of the loop was on the <unk> Cement Works Railway ( near Geelong ) , where a 1300 metre long tunnel existed on a narrow gauge quarry railway . Of those open today the longest is the single track 422 metre long Geelong Tunnel , followed by the double track 385 metre Elphinstone and the 390 metre long Big Hill Tunnels on the Bendigo line . A 154 metre long tunnel also exists on the Healesville line , as well as three tunnels on the suburban <unk> line , and another on the freight lines under Footscray station . 
 On the interstate railway corridors there are independent sections of track due to the use of both broad and standard gauges in the state , these sections being from Melbourne to Seymour and on to Albury ( constructed in the 1960s ) , and Melbourne to Geelong ( completed in 1995 ) . The gauge issue also sees dual gauge track used , in areas including Maryborough , North Geelong , and various freight terminals in Melbourne . 
 The maximum speed of suburban electric multiple units and locomotive hauled trains is 115 km / h , with diesel multiple units permitted up to 130 km / h on the same track , and up to 160 km / h on specified lines . The maximum axle loading of freight wagons is 20 tonnes , with locomotives of up to 22 tonne axle loading operating . Train lengths are limited to 1200 metres , except on the main interstate lines where 1500 metre long trains are permitted .

 The majority of the railways of Victoria are of 5 ft 3 in ( 1 @,@ 600 mm ) broad gauge , presenting break @-@ of @-@ gauge difficulties when connections were made with New South Wales which uses the 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 435 mm ) standard gauge . In addition , the Victorian Railways experimented with four short narrow gauge lines of 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) in the early 20th century . Efforts to eliminate the gauge issue were proposed many times in the intervening years , with a Royal Commission in 1921 deciding " that the gauge of 4 @-@ ft . 8 @.@ 5 @-@ in. be adopted as the standard for Australia ; that no mechanical , third rail , or other device would meet the situation , and that uniformity could be secured by one means only , viz . , by conversion of the gauges other than 4 @-@ ft . 8 @.@ 5 @-@ in . " 
 By the 1950s , interstate traffic was suffering from the break @-@ of @-@ gauge at the New South Wales state border , and a parallel standard gauge line was opened from the Melbourne to join the New South Wales system in 1962 , along with a bogie exchange depot to allow wagons to operate across the broad and standard gauge networks . The second interstate link from Victoria to Adelaide ( the oldest single @-@ gauge inter @-@ capital line dating from 1887 ) was converted from broad to standard gauge in 1995 enabling rail traffic from Victoria to access the rest of the nation without disruption . 
 Today the standard gauge network consists of the two main interstate lines , and a number of branch lines in the far west of the state . Gauge conversion of 2000 kilometres of track was announced in May 2001 by the Victorian Government under the Linking Victoria program , but did not proceed due to the difficulty of achieving any agreement with then track manager , Freight Australia . The works would have covered 13 lines , including the Mildura line via Geelong , Ballarat , and Maryborough ; the north western Victorian grain network ; and the lines centred upon Seymour and Benalla in the north east . Conversion of the regional and suburban passenger networks is not envisioned . In 2008 the conversion of the North East line was announced , with the conversion of 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) of broad gauge track to standard gauge between Seymour and Albury providing double track along the section .

Double stacking of container wagons is not possible under these limits , with 2 @,@ 655 mm ( 8 ft 8 @.@ 5 in ) high containers the largest permitted , with the exception of 3 @,@ 200 mm ( 10 ft 6 in ) high containers on some routes . Trials were made with the 4D double deck passenger train on some suburban lines , requiring alterations to overhead bridges and structures , but no double deck trains are used today . 
 = = = Signalling = = = 
 Compare with Australian railway signalling 
 Victoria uses a mix of railway signalling practices : British route signalling with home and distant signals ( 2 position signalling ) and American speed signalling ( 3 position signalling ) . 
 Semaphore signals were used on the very first railway lines , but only a bare minimum were provided as the time interval system being relied upon instead . The first interlocking of signals to protect trains was provided in 1874 , as before this time conflicting moves could be made . The design of the signals also progressed , with the disc type siding signals first introduced in 1885 , and the lower quadrant somersault type main line signals adopted in 1887 , both of which are still in use today . Green was not adopted as the All Right colour until 1898 , with white being used before this time . Red was the usual colour of all signal arms , until yellow was chosen as the colour for distant signals in 1926 , with full adoption made in 1930 . Colour light signals first appeared in 1918 , and by 1924 they were the standard for new installations . 
 The safeworking of trains between stations on the early lines was time interval working , where a train would be allowed to leave a given time after the train before it . With heavier traffic this method became unsafe , with Staff and Ticket working on single lines adopted from 1873 , and telegraph block working from 1878 on double lines . Both of these systems ensured that only one train would be in a section of track at one time . Telegraphic block working was then replaced with Winters Block working between 1883 and 1888 , a system that is a predecessor of the Double line Block system which is still used today . Later years saw variations made to the Staff and Ticket system , with busier lines provided with Electric Staff working which provided greater safely when more trains ran . 
 Heavier suburban traffic on the Melbourne network saw a greater strain on the block working then used , which required a large number of manned signal boxes to enable trains to run close together . As a result , it was decided to adopt power signalling under the Automatic Block System ( ABS ) of safeworking , where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them , providing a safe distance between trains . Introduced from 1915 , the system was based on American speed signalling practice with <unk> upper quadrant mechanical signals with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers . These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today , but the old mechanical style remained until 2001 . 
 A variant of the Automatic Block System , Automatic and Track Control ( ATC ) has since been introduced , which provides the same benefits as ABS on single lines of track , while still ensuring only one train in a section at a time . Centralised Traffic Control was also introduced in the 1960s on the new standard gauge line to Albury , and then on the main interstate line to Adelaide , allowing trains to be directed from a distance . 
 Today little mechanical signalling remains , with local signal boxes controlling signals abolished from many areas as part of the Regional Fast Rail project . The suburban network and busier regional lines use variants of Automatic Block Signalling , while quieter lines use the Train Staff and Ticket or Train Order systems of safeworking . Train protection has also progressed , with the Train Protection & Warning System also introduced on major passenger lines as part of the Regional Fast Rail project .

 <unk> in Victoria has used air braking since tests of continuous train brakes were carried out in 1884 . Initially screw couplings were used to connect wagons , but from 1924 automatic knuckle couplers were introduced , with buffers removed from freight wagons by 1960 . 
 = = = Locomotives = = = 
 In Victoria groups of locomotives of the same design are classed together by letter , in a system introduced in 1886 . Initially low letters were given to passenger classes , and high letters for goods classes , but from about 1916 this pattern was discarded . Within classes locomotives are individually numbered , in a continuous number block which is unique to the class . In some cases locomotives have been renumbered to keep number blocks continuous , and in some cases there is no correlation between the number blocks used for the steam and diesel locomotives of the same class letter . In addition , some classes start the number series with a 0 , while others start with a 1 . 
 The first locomotives used in the state were small steam locomotives , and by the end of the 19th century 0 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 tender engines were used on goods , and 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 configurations for passenger workings . The majority of locomotives were imported from Britain , from companies such as Beyer , Peacock and Company , Robert Stephenson and Company , R and W Hawthorn and George England and Co .. The Williamstown Workshops also built locomotives locally , as did the Phoenix Foundry in Ballarat . 
 As the size of train increased , so did the locomotives . The 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 wheel arrangement became popular for passenger and mixed traffic work with the D3 and A2 classes , and the 2 @-@ 8 @-@ 0 arrangement on goods with the K , J and C classes lasting into the 1960s . These were then followed by the 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 2 S class Pacifics for the Spirit of Progress express , and the single 4 @-@ 8 @-@ 4 H class locomotive <unk> , the biggest Victorian Railways steam locomotive . The final steam locomotives built for the Victorian Railways were the 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 4 R class and 2 @-@ 8 @-@ 0 J classes . Although they were of more modern design , their advantages were overshadowed by the simultaneous arrival of the first diesels . 
 Electric locomotives were first acquired with the electrification of the suburban railways , the E class suburban engines acquired in 1923 and 1928 – 29 , followed by the L class from 1953 when the mainline to Traralgon was electrified for <unk> traffic . 
 <unk> occurred from 1951 with the F class shunter , but the B and S classes of 1952 and 1957 revolutionised main line operations . They were then followed by the T and Y classes in 1955 and 1963 which displaced steam from the branch lines and yards . Apart from the F class , Clyde Engineering has had a monopoly on Victorian diesel @-@ electric <unk> as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and traction motors , fitting them into locally designed bodies . By the 1980s the first generation locomotives were approaching the end of their lives , with the electric locomotives withdrawn by 1988 , and the modern N and G classes allowing the withdrawal of lower power T and Y classes . 
 Today the former Victorian Railways locomotive fleet has been split into two , with the N , A and P classes utilised by V / Line on passenger services , with the remainder with Pacific National or other private operators in freight use . No new passenger locomotives have been built since the 1980s , with Diesel Multiple Units being acquired instead . Freight operations have seen the re @-@ powering of the G and X classes , as well as the restoration to service of stored locomotives , now up to 50 years old . 
 = = = Passenger = = = 
 Early passenger services were operated with 4 and 6 wheeled " <unk> " passenger carriage with small compartments and no side corridors . Later years saw the provision of side corridors to provide access down the train , and onboard toilets . Sleeping carriages was first introduced in 1887 , and dining cars from 1908 . 
 Larger bogie <unk> started to appear from the turn of the 20th century , with the E type carriage stock introduced on The Overland , and smaller W type carriage stock on intrastate trains . The first air conditioned carriage was introduced in 1935 , when one of the E type carriages was fitted . All steel carriages came to the Victorian Railways in 1927 , with the construction of the " Avoca " and " Hopkins " dining cars , followed by the S type carriage stock for the new Spirit of Progress in 1937 . 
 On the Melbourne suburban network Electric Multiple Units were introduced speeding up services . Experiments were also made with various diesel and petrol railcars for use smaller branch lines , with the <unk> being the most successful , remaining in service from 1928 to 1991 . A fleet of Walker railcars was also introduced in the 1950s , along with Z type saloon carriage stock for both intra and interstate trains . 
 By the 1980s country passenger services were run down , and older wooden rolling stock was now approaching their use by date . As a result , the N type carriages were introduced from 1981 , followed by the converted H type stock from 1984 . Since then , diesel multiple units have become the norm for new purchases , with the Sprinter introduced in 1992 , and the <unk> from 2005 .

 Early wagons were built on four wheeled under frames , but from 1871 bogie vehicles begun to appear . These early wagons were of all wood construction , but later types had wood bogies on steel underframes , then followed by all steel wagons . Groups of wagons of the same design are classed together by a multiple character alphabetical code , initially in a system restricted to Victoria only , but from 1979 the Railways of Australia four letter coding was introduced . Under this system the first letter represent owner of the wagon , the second represents the general type of wagon , the third separates different classes of the same general type , and the four letter indicates the maximum running speed . 
 The last four wheeled open wagons were built in 1958 , but were not scrapped in large numbers until the 1980s when new bogie wagons replaced them . In 1987 the bogie wagon fleet numbered 5000 , with approximately 700 grain hoppers , 800 container flats , 1000 louvred vans , 700 open wagons , 400 tank cars , and 300 flat wagons . Today the broad gauge intrastate fleet numbers 2600 , with large numbers of louvred vans , open and flat wagons , and tank cars stored or scrapped due to the transfer of traffic to road following years of apathy by Governments .

 Victoria does not have a dominant mining base as with other states , and has traditionally been more dependent on agriculture for rail freight traffic . In the early 20th century rail was a " common carrier " and was required to carry almost any freight offered . After World War I road competition increased , until in 1933 legislation was passed to regulate trucks competing with rail on specific routes . From 1974 to the 1980s intrastate road freight was deregulated , and rail " common carrier " obligations were removed , resulting in the loss of to road of much non @-@ bulk freight . In 1987 10 @.@ 51 million tonnes of freight was carried by rail , with bulk grain being the main commodity consisting of 31 @.@ 4 % of traffic . 
 Continued drought , road competition , and rationalisation of intrastate freight operations have seen this change in recent years , with an average of only 6 @.@ 1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998 ; and containers now being the major traffic , with residual cement , logs , quarry , and steel trains operating . By the 1990s road transport has captured most general freight traffic , with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 with the end of the Fastrack freight service . An exception to the decline is interstate operations , with intermodal container traffic growing due to competition between private operators . 
 = = = Companies = = = 
 The first railways in Victoria were operated by private companies , but when these companies failed or defaulted , Victorian Railways took over . The Victorian Railways was initially known as the " Department of Railways " from the first appointment of staff in 1856 , and on 1 November 1883 the Victorian Railways Commissioners Act established the " Victorian Railways " . 
 This situation remained until May 1973 when the Railways ( Amendment ) Act 1972 passed the management of the Railways from the Victorian Railways Commissioners to a Victorian Railways Board , with rebranding as VicRail following in 1976 . 
 In 1983 VicRail was split into the State Transport Authority taking responsibility for the provision of country rail and road , passenger and freight services under the V / Line brand ; and the Metropolitan Transit Authority taking over suburban passenger operations . These authorities were then merged into the Public Transport Corporation in 1989 , with the suburban services rebranded as " The Met " . 
 In 1993 the Kennett Government offered long @-@ distance country rail services previously run by the government @-@ owned operator V / Line to private operators . While several rail services were replaced by road coach services , West Coast Railway successfully tendered to operate the railway line to Warrnambool , becoming the first private operator in Victoria . In 1993 Professor Fred Hilmer presented the findings of the National Competition Policy Review Committee , known as the Hilmer Report , leading to the introduction of National Competition Policy in 1995 . This allowed new rail freight operators to establish operations in Victoria . Specialised Container Transport commenced operating trains to Perth in 1995 , and Great Northern Rail Services started intrastate operations . 
 Privatisation of the Public Transport Corporation commenced under the Kennett Government of the 1990s . V / Line was split into separate freight and passenger divisions , and " The Met " was divided into " Hillside Trains " and " Bayside Trains " . These separate bodies were all sold separately in 1999 : V / Line Freight and the rural intrastate network to Freight Victoria ; Hillside Trains and track lease to Connex Melbourne ; and V / Line Passenger and Bayside Trains ( with track lease ) to the National Express Group . Control of V / Line 's former interstate rail freight infrastructure was passed to the federal Australian Rail Track Corporation . 
 On 22 December 2002 National Express withdrew from their operations in Victoria and the government taking control temporarily , V / Line reverted to government ownership on 1 October 2003 , and M @-@ Train was taken over by Connex on 18 April 2004 . 16 August 2004 saw the Freight Victoria business and rural track lease was purchased by Pacific National , but by November 2006 they entered into an agreement to sell the track lease back to the Victorian Government for $ 133 @.@ 8 million , with the sale completed on 7 May 2007 and V / Line becoming track manager . 
 In December 2007 Pacific National announced plans to sell or close its grain transport and <unk> rural container business operations in Victoria . The decision has been criticised as it will force grain growers to use higher cost road transport to transport the annual grain harvest from rural silos to the ports . The decision has seen many commentators accuse Pacific National of only acquiring the operations of Freight Australia in 2004 for the purposes of asset stripping and eliminating competition in rail freight . In 2008 El Zorro took over the Warrnambool - Melbourne container service from Pacific National , and moved into broad gauge grain services , while <unk> has taken over the Melbourne - Horsham container service .

 Victoria 's first railway was a 4 km Victorian broad gauge line between the Melbourne ( or City ) Terminus ( on the site of modern @-@ day Flinders Street Station ) and Sandridge ( now Port Melbourne ) , constructed by the Melbourne and Hobson 's Bay Railway Company and opened in September 1854 . Today , Melbourne 's suburban railway network consists of 16 electrified lines , the central City Loop subway , and 200 stations , with a total length of 372 km of the electrified lines , operated by Metro Trains Melbourne under franchise to the Government of Victoria . 
 In Gippsland the Orbost line was constructed as an extension of suburban lines between 1877 and 1888 to Bairnsdale , and extended eastwards to Orbost in 1916 . The line between Dandenong and Traralgon was electrified in 1954 , but electrification was cut back progressively to Pakenham between 1987 and 2001 . V / Line passenger trains now run as far as Bairnsdale . 
 The South Gippsland line was opened from Dandenong to Cranbourne , Leongatha and Port Albert between 1888 and 1892 . A number of branch lines were also built , with almost all closed in stages between the early 1970s and 1994 , except for part has since been electrified and re @-@ opened as part of the suburban network , and between <unk> and Leongatha where the South Gippsland Tourist Railway operates heritage services . 
 The North East line originated from a suburban line to Essendon in 1860 , being extended to Wodonga by 1873 , connecting with the New South Wales Government Railways at Albury at a break @-@ of @-@ gauge in 1883 . A standard gauge track was completed parallel with the broad gauge track from Albury to Melbourne in 1962 . The broad gauge track has been converted to standard gauge between Seymour and Albury . 
 The Shepparton line was built from Mangalore to Shepparton in 1880 and extended to the New South Wales Government Railways at Tocumwal at a break @-@ of @-@ gauge in 1908 . V / Line passenger service run as far as Shepparton . 
 The Bendigo line was completed in 1862 , with extensions were opened to Echuca in 1864 , and Swan Hill in 1890 , followed by a number of lines throughout the north @-@ west corner of the state . Only these lines continue to see V / Line services , with other lines in the region only seeing freight traffic . 
 The main western line had its beginnings in the first railway line from Melbourne to Ballarat , the Geelong @-@ Ballarat line that opened in 1862 . The line extended from Ballarat to Ararat between 1874 and 1875 , but it was not until 1889 that the direct line between Melbourne and Ballarat was opened , built from both ends in stages until they met at Ballan . Further branch lines followed to Portland and other western towns . The line formed the first interstate railway line in Australia , when it was extended to the South Australian Railways at <unk> in 1887 . Up until the 1990s the Ballarat line was on the main route between Melbourne and Adelaide , as well as The Overland services to Adelaide , until the One Nation Program rerouted the main interstate line via Geelong and <unk> as standard gauge . 
 The Port Fairy line was started when the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company opened the Geelong line to Newport in 1857 , being extended to Spencer Street Station in 1859 . The line was taken over by Victorian Railways in 1860 and a line was opened from Geelong to Ballarat in 1862 , and later extended south @-@ east from 1876 , reaching Warrnambool and Port Fairy in 1890 . Branch lines also existed to Queenscliff , Beech Forest , and a number of other towns . 
 = = Private railways = = 
 A small number of private railways have also existed at various times . Some , such as the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company , and the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company , Melbourne and Hobson 's Bay Railway Company , Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company and St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company were acquired by the Victorian Railways and made part of the core state network in 1860 and 1878 respectively . Other country branch lines were also built by private companies : namely the <unk> @-@ <unk> Tramway and the Deniliquin and <unk> Railway , both not being acquired until the 20th century . 
 In addition to the main Victorian rail network of the Victorian Railways and successors , a number of narrow gauge private railways and tramways have also existed for logging and mining purposes . These included the <unk> <unk> Railway in the Latrobe Valley open cut coal mines , the <unk> Cement Works Railway near Geelong , the Tyers Valley Tramway at Mount Baw Baw , and the <unk> Tramway from Yarra Junction . 
 Most logging tramways operated in the Otway Ranges , Gippsland , and the inner east of the Great Dividing Range ; primarily between the 1850s and the 1950s , with only one surviving into the 1960s . They were primarily of 3 ft 6 in ( 1 @,@ 067 mm ) or 3 ft ( 914 mm ) gauge , with 2 ft ( 610 mm ) , 2 ft 6 in ( 762 mm ) , 4 ft ( 1 @,@ 219 mm ) , 5 ft 3 in ( 1 @,@ 600 mm ) and variants also used . 
 = = Railway preservation = = 
 Organised railway preservation commenced in Victoria with the formation of the Puffing Billy Preservation Society in 1955 , and operating under the Emerald Tourist Railway Board from 1977 . Formed to operate the narrow gauge 2 ft 6 in ( 760 mm ) gauge railway in the Dandenong Ranges near Melbourne , the group continues to operate the railway today . 
 The demise of the last of the steam locomotives in Victoria commenced in the 1960s , with the Australian Railway Historical Society and Association of Railway Enthusiasts working with the Victorian Railways to have a number of locomotives preserved for the future . In 1962 the <unk> Railway Museum was established at North Williamstown to house static exhibits , and <unk> Victoria was formed in 1965 to assist in the restoration of locomotives and carriages for use on special trains . 
 By the 1980s a number of heritage railways had been established in Victoria on closed branch lines . These railways serve both as tourist attractions , and to preserve the railway past . The work of railway preservation groups has since expanded to retired railway carriages , electric multiple units , rail motors , and diesel locomotives . In 2006 heritage railways carried 542 @,@ 000 patrons over 161 km of track ; with 28 operational steam locomotives , 47 diesels , 14 railmotors , and 192 carriages .

 The prime rail statute in Victoria is the Transport Integration Act . The Act establishes the Department of Transport , Planning and Local Infrastructure as the integration agency for Victoria 's transport system . The Act also establishes and sets the charters of the State agencies charged with providing public transport rail services and managing network access for freight services , namely the Director of Public Transport and V / Line . In addition , the Act creates <unk> which owns the public rail network and associated infrastructure . Another important statute is the Rail Management Act 1996 which confers powers on rail operators and provides for a rail access scheme for the State 's rail network . As a result of recent changes to the Transport Integration Act , the responsibilities of the Director of Public Transport are being progressively assumed by the new Public Transport Development Authority , a major initiative of the <unk> Government .

 The safety of rail operations in Victoria is regulated by the Rail Safety Act 2006 which applies to all commercial passenger and freight operations as well as tourist and heritage railways . The Act creates a framework containing safety duties for all rail industry participants and requires rail operators who manage infrastructure and rolling stock to obtain accreditation prior to commencing operations . Accredited rail operators are also required to have a safety management system to guide their operations . 
 Sanctions applying to the safety scheme established under the Rail Safety Act are contained in the Transport ( Compliance and Miscellaneous ) Act 1983 .

 = Siege of Badajoz ( 1658 ) = 
 The 4th Siege of Badajoz took place from July to October 1658 during the Portuguese Restoration War . It was an attempt by a huge Portuguese army under the command of Joanne Mendes de Vasconcelos , governor of Alentejo , to capture the Spanish city of Badajoz , which was the headquarters of the Spanish Army of Extremadura . The fortifications of Badajoz were essentially medieval and considered vulnerable by the Portuguese , and had already been attacked by them three times during this war . 
 So in 1658 , Mendes de Vasconcelos gathered an army at Elvas and advanced on Badajoz . The city was poorly defended and the Spanish troops under the command of Francisco de <unk> , Duke of San Germán , looked principally to their own survival until a Spanish relief expedition could be mounted . The Portuguese forces launched a direct assault on the town , hoping initially to capture a key fort , San Cristóbal , but after 22 days of unsuccessful attack , the Portuguese abandoned this plan and began to build a circumvallation wall around Badajoz instead , to try to isolate the city . These plans received a boost when they captured a large Spanish defensive installation outside Badajoz , the Fort of San Miguel , but were unable to use this platform successfully against Badajoz itself . 
 The siege lasted for four months , during which time one @-@ third of the Portuguese troops either died ( mainly from the plague ) or deserted . The arrival of a relief army , under King Philip IV of Spain 's favorite don Luis de Haro in October , lifted the siege . Mendes de Vasconcelos , the Portuguese commander , was stripped of his rank and imprisoned for his failure . 
 Taking advantage of this failure , D. Luis de Haro , invaded Portugal and besieged Elvas , the main defensive system of Portugal - where the Portuguese army that had besieged Badajoz took refuge and was suffering a second catastrophic plague . A small relief army was improvised by the Portuguese which inflicted a crushing defeat to the Spanish army at the decisive battle of the Lines of Elvas ( 14 January 1659 ) . This way , the Portuguese independence was granted while the Spanish reached military advantage in the secondary front of war , Minho and Galicia . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the death of John IV of Portugal in 1656 , various Spanish offensives were launched against Portuguese territory , mainly from Extremadura , but also from Galicia , where a second front was opened to force the Portuguese to divide their forces . The Spanish Army of Extremadura , recently reinforced with many veterans of the war against France , was commanded by Francisco de <unk> , Duke of San German , who appointed Gaspar Téllez @-@ Girón y Sandoval , Duke of Osuna , as general of artillery and his second @-@ in @-@ command . In 1657 they laid siege to the Portuguese town of <unk> with 8 @,@ 000 soldiers and 29 cannons and occupied the town , despite a desperate attempt by the Count of San Lorenzo , military governor of Alentejo , to dislodge them by launching a surprise attack himself on the Spanish town of Badajoz . Mourão fell into Spanish hands shortly thereafter . San Lorenzo was then dismissed from his command and replaced by dom Joanne Mendes de Vasconcelos , who easily managed to retake both Mourão and <unk> in the following months , since their Spanish garrisons had been considerably diminished in order to move troops to face the French armies in Catalonia . 
 Mendes de Vasconcelos , encouraged by his successes , promised the Portuguese Queen Regent Luisa de Guzmán that he would capture the town of Badajoz , headquarters of the Spanish Army of Extremadura and therefore the most important Spanish fortress near the Portuguese frontier . The Count of <unk> suggested that an offensive in the north , to conquer the Galician city of Tui , would be easier , due to the mild climate of the coast , and suggested that this would also be strategically more beneficial as it would secure the province of Entre Douro e Minho . But the queen and her ministers preferred Mendes de Vasconcelos ' plan . He was given command of an army consisting of 14 @,@ 000 infantry and 3 @,@ 000 cavalry troops with a train of 20 cannons and 2 mortars , gathered in the main fortress of Elvas . Mendes de Vasconcelos ' second @-@ in @-@ command was the recently appointed Maestro de Campo General dom Rodrigo de Castro , a friend of the Count of <unk> , Vasconcelos ' enemy in the court , which was a cause of friction between them . 
 The Spanish fortress town of Badajoz was at that time garrisoned by 4 @,@ 000 infantry and 2 @,@ 000 cavalry soldiers . The military governor of the fortress was the Marquis of Lanzarote , Diego Paniagua y Zúñiga , but the command of the army belonged to the Duke of San German , who had retreated to Badajoz after the loss of Olivenza , which he had briefly attempted to retake . The infantry was led by don Diego Caballero de Illescas , the tercios by don Rodrigo de <unk> y <unk> , the cavalry by the Duke of Osuna , and the artillery by don Gaspar de la Cueva , brother of the Viceroy of New Spain . The defenses of the town consisted essentially of an old Moorish Alcazaba and a medieval wall dating from the Almohad period , reinforced since the outbreak of the war in 1640 by various newly built bulwarks and ravelins . 
 = = Siege = = 
 = = = Preliminary maneuvers = = = 
 The Portuguese army left its fortress at Elvas on 12 July and arrived outside Badajoz the following day . A company of cuirassiers under dom Luiz de Menezes and some cavalry troops commanded by dom André de Albuquerque were confronted near a bridge over the Guadiana river by a Spanish cavalry party led by the Duke of Osuna . Both units retreated after inflicting serious losses upon each other in a bloody fight , the Spanish seeking protection behind the walls of the town . Mendes de Vasconcelos arrived shortly thereafter with the main Portuguese army , with its artillery , and a large number of supply wagons brought from Elvas . Seeing the strength of the Portuguese army , the Duke of San German hastily sent a message calling on Philip IV for help . 
 Despite the longstanding danger of a Portuguese attack , the situation of the Spanish force in Badajoz was dreadful . The garrison suffered from a lack of ammunition and supplies , the soldiers were dressed in rags or were practically nude , and there was none among the civilian population of the town trained to wield a weapon . The Duke of San German put soldiers and civilians to work on the fortifications and storing food . The Portuguese sappers , meanwhile , proceeded to prepare the field for an assault upon the fortress . Mendes de Vasconcelos had decided , in a war council with many other senior officers , to attack Fort San Cristóbal , a key point in the Badajoz defenses . This fort , built after 1640 , covered a bridgehead over the Guadiana river , thus guarding access to the city . A redoubt was quickly strengthened on the bridgehead by the Spanish sappers , who , protected by the Duke of Osuna and his cavalry , also widened the trenches which connected it with Fort San Cristóbal , the garrison of which was being strengthened every day along a strongly defended communication road . 
 The Portuguese assault was thoroughly prepared . The plan was for six Portuguese squadrons under dom João da Silva to block the entrance to the bridge , isolating the redoubt from Fort San <unk> . The fort would in turn be attacked by Alfonso <unk> and Simon Correa da Silva . Maestre de Campo dom Diogo Gomes was given the task of cutting the communication lines along the Guadiana river and Pedro <unk> of distracting several minor forts nearby . Some cavalry regiments were deployed in the expectation of a fierce Spanish resistance . 
 The assault , however , was a costly failure . After twenty @-@ two days of prolonged action , during which the defenders , led by the Marquis of Lanzarote , virtually wiped out <unk> 's regiment with musketry fire and firebombs , Mendes de Vasconcelos ordered a withdrawal . 
 = = = Attempted encirclement = = = 
 The Portuguese general , convinced of the impossibility of taking Badajoz by assault , changed his strategy and began a circumvallation of the town , in order to try to isolate it completely . The Spanish , meanwhile , were reinforcing their own defensive fortifications with extensive works , mainly ravelins built between the medieval towers . Various outlying forts were also strengthened with the aim of obstructing the Portuguese works and forcing them to build a larger circumvallation line . One of these forts was San Miguel , a star fort able to accommodate 600 infantry , built around a hermitage . It had five earthen bulwarks and an artillery @-@ proof parapet . 
 Portuguese sappers built a pontoon bridge over the Guadiana river which united two Portuguese quarters in Vado del Moro and allowed Mendes de Vasconcelos ' troops to cross the river . Having reinforced Santa Engracia , north of San <unk> , and fortified a bridge over the Gévora river , they built , unmolested , an arc of the circumvallation from Gévora to Vado del Moro . Fort del <unk> , located near the Guadiana river , had been abandoned by its Spanish garrison shortly after being built . The Portuguese used it to cover the construction of the circumvallation line to the Guadiana . They also tried to occupy Cerro del Viento , a hill near Vado del Moro , but were repelled by the Spanish garrison that was there and had to build the circumvallation line behind it . Given the strategic importance of Cerro del Viento , the nearby hill of Cerro de las Mayas had been earmarked for an improvised star fortification by the Italian general Ventura de Tarragona , but it had not been built , leaving the Fort of San Miguel vulnerable . 
 Mendes de Vasconcelos instructed dom André de Albuquerque , dom Rodrigo de Castro and the Count of <unk> to occupy the Convent of San Gabriel . All the Portuguese cavalry and five <unk> were dispatched with this aim . They passed through the undefended Cerro de las Mayas and easily overran the convent , whose small Spanish garrison promptly surrendered . The Portuguese sappers then began to build a fort in front of an old watchtower known as " Torre <unk> " , located between the convent and the Fort of San Miguel . The continued Spanish occupation of the Fort of San Miguel was preventing the completion of the circumvallation line , so its capture was a priority to Vasconcellos . Albuquerque and the Count of <unk> , assisted by the engineers Nicolao de <unk> , Pedro de S. Coloma , and Luiz Serrão Pimentel , planned an assault on the fortification . 
 On 20 June , after an ineffective bombardment by a 6 @-@ gun battery put in place to try to breach the parapets , the Portuguese tercios and the cavalry , the latter covered by ranks of musketeers , were ordered to attack . The advance was made difficult by the presence of vineyard fences in the field . Moreover , 5 Portuguese battalions at the head of the attack were surprised by the Spanish cavalry of the Duke of Osuna and his general , don Juan de Pacheco , followed by the Duke of San German who , with various Spanish tercios , had sallied out of Badajoz in order to try to counter the Portuguese assault . Maestre de Campo of Tercio de la Armada , whose brother the Irish officer William Dongan was the commander of the Fort of San Miguel , managed to reach the fort . Albuquerque , meanwhile ordered dom Luiz de Menezes to reinforce his vanguard battalions . The Portuguese cavalry was also sent into action . <unk> General Diniz de Mello de Castro was wounded and captured , but a Spanish counter @-@ attack was repelled and the Fort of San Miguel finally surrendered . 
 = = = Skirmishing and bombardment = = = 
 The capture of Fort San Miguel allowed the Portuguese sappers to complete the circumvallation works , which consisted of a continuous line of little forts , each able to garrison as many as about 200 soldiers , or perhaps as few as 25 musketeers . The Spanish also continued strengthening their defenses . The Southwestern section of the wall was fortified at <unk> , and a ravelin was erected 400 meters in front of the Gate of Santa Maria . No significant action took place during this period , except for an ambush near San Gabriel by André de Albuquerque , against a Spanish supply convoy sent from La Albuera , and various sorties by the garrison of Badajoz to try to obstruct the Portuguese works . A night attack by the Spanish Duke of Osuna against a Portuguese section cost Mendes de Vasconcelos 200 infantry and 40 horses . 
 On 6 August , however , Osuna and San German abandoned the town , and with 1 @,@ 200 cavalry soldiers , broke the lines of circumvallation near the quarter of Santa Engracia , between two Portuguese redoubts , reaching Alburquerque shortly thereafter . San German was replaced in the command of Badajoz by Rodrigo de <unk> y <unk> , his Maestre de Campo General . The Spanish concentrated their efforts on the defense of a large ravelin in <unk> garrisoned by 2 @,@ 000 infantry and 1 @,@ 000 cavalry , against Portuguese artillery fire from Cerro del Viento and San Miguel . In late August , news of the formation of a relief army under Philip IV of Spain 's favorite Luis de Haro reached the Portuguese camp , increasing the pressure upon Mendes de Vasconcelos to bring his siege to a conclusion . Unfortunately , the damage caused by the bombardment of the Spanish positions was minor , and heat and disease was decimating the Portuguese army .

 The Duke of Medina de las Torres had suggested that Philip IV himself should lead the relief of Badajoz in the company of all the Grandees of Spain . Luis de Haro , Philip IV 's favourite , however , feared that Queen Mariana of Austria would be given the government of the country during the absence of the king , and , although having no military experience , offered himself to lead the relief army . His force consisted of up to 12 @,@ 000 infantry and 4 @,@ 500 cavalry , or perhaps as little as 8 @,@ 000 infantry and 1 @,@ 000 cavalry . Haro did not reach Badajoz until mid @-@ October , but his appearance compelled Mendes de Vasconcelos to abandon the siege . The buildings in Cerro del Viento were set on fire and the bridge over the Gévora river was destroyed , The Portuguese army retreated unmolested to Elvas having lost 6 @,@ 200 men in all , either killed in battle or dead from disease . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 When the Spanish relief army arrived , Luis de Haro entered Badajoz , where he was acclaimed by some as " Liberator of the town and <unk> of the Monarchy " . In Portugal , Queen Luisa de Guzmán imprisoned Mendes de Vasconcelos for his failure to capture Badajoz . News of a further setback for the Portuguese arrived from the northern frontier , as a Spanish army commanded by the Governor of Galicia , Rodrigo Pimentel , Marquis of Viana , entered Portuguese territory in early September , defeating a Portuguese army led by João Rodrigues de Vasconcelos e Sousa , 2nd Count of Castelo <unk> at the Battle of Vilanova . Spanish forces proceeded over the following months to capture <unk> , <unk> , Salvatierra de Miño and other Portuguese strongholds . De Haro , meanwhile , decided to attack Portugal on his own and , against the advice of the Duke of San German , advanced towards the Portuguese fortress of Elvas . 
 Elvas was reached by the Spanish army on 22 October and a siege begun . Although the fortifications could not ensure safety from a full @-@ scale assault supported with heavy guns , they enabled the defenders to withstand a considerable attack for enough time to allow the Portuguese to mobilize a relief army in <unk> , firstly under André de Albuquerque and later under António Luís de Meneses , Count of <unk> . On 17 January , around 8 o 'clock in the morning , the Portuguese attacked the Spanish in their trenches . The battle was undecided in its initial stages , as the Duke of San Germán and other Spanish generals made every effort to collect their troops and recover the lost ground , but after some time , the Portuguese forces of <unk> managed to break the lines and the Spanish retreated to Badajoz with great loss : from the initial army of 17 , 500 men , only 5 @,@ 000 infantry men plus 1 @,@ 300 horsemen managed to reach Badajoz , and all the artillery together with 5 @,@ 000 men , 15 @,@ 000 firearms , luggage and correspondence , were captured . The Portuguese army again besieged Badajoz shortly after , bringing events in the region full circle , but failed once again to take the city . By then , the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees had ended <unk> 's war with France and the recovery of Portugal had become the main objective of Philip IV .

 Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a 1988 American live @-@ action / animated fantasy comedy film directed by Robert Zemeckis , produced by Frank Marshall and Robert Watts , and written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman . The film is based on Gary K. Wolf 's 1981 novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit ? . The film stars Bob Hoskins , Christopher Lloyd , Charles Fleischer , Stubby Kaye ( in his final film role before his retirement and death ) , and Joanna Cassidy . Set in Hollywood during the late 1940s , the film tells the story of Eddie Valiant , a private detective who must exonerate animated character Roger Rabbit , who is accused of murdering a wealthy businessman . 
 Walt Disney Pictures purchased the film rights for Who Framed Roger Rabbit 's story in 1981 . Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman wrote two drafts of the script before Disney brought in executive producer Steven Spielberg , and his production company , Amblin Entertainment . Zemeckis was brought on to direct the film , and Canadian animator Richard Williams was hired to supervise the animation sequences . Production was moved from Los Angeles to Elstree Studios in England to accommodate Williams and his group of animators . While filming , the production budget began to rapidly expand and the shooting schedule ran longer than expected . 
 Disney released the film through its Touchstone Pictures division on June 22 , 1988 , to critical and commercial success , becoming a blockbuster . The film brought a renewed interest in the Golden Age of American animation , spearheading modern American animation and the Disney Renaissance . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 1947 Hollywood , " toons " act out theatrical cartoon shorts as with live @-@ action films ; they regularly interact with real people and animals and reside in Toontown , an animated portion of Los Angeles . Private detective Eddie Valiant and his brother , Teddy , once worked closely with the toons on several famous cases , but after Teddy was killed by a toon , Eddie lapsed into alcoholism and vowed never to work for toons again . One day , R.K. Maroon , head of Maroon Cartoon Studios , is concerned about the recent poor acting performances of one of his biggest stars , Roger Rabbit . Maroon hires Valiant to investigate rumors about Roger 's voluptuous toon wife Jessica being romantically involved with businessman and gadgets inventor , Marvin Acme , owner of both Acme Corporation and Toontown . After watching Jessica perform at the underground Ink & Paint Club , Valiant secretly takes photographs of her and Acme playing patty @-@ cake in her dressing room , which he shows to Roger . Maroon suggests to Roger that he should leave Jessica , but a drunken Roger refuses and flees . 
 Acme is discovered murdered in his factory the next morning ; a safe had been dropped on his head , and evidence points to Roger being responsible . At the crime scene , Valiant meets Judge Doom , Toontown 's Superior Court judge , who has created a substance capable of killing a toon : a toxic chemical known as " The Dip " . Valiant runs into Roger 's toon co @-@ star , Baby Herman , who believes Roger is innocent and Acme 's missing will ( which will give the toons ownership of Toontown ) may be the key to his murder . He then finds Roger hiding in his office , who begs him to help exonerate him . Valiant reluctantly hides Roger in a local bar where his ex @-@ girlfriend , Dolores , works . Later , Jessica approaches Valiant and says that Maroon had forced her to pose for the photographs so that he could blackmail Acme . 
 Doom and his toon @-@ weasel henchmen discover Roger , but he and Valiant escape with Benny , an anthropomorphic toon cab . They flee to a theater , where Valiant tells Roger about Teddy 's death . As they leave with Dolores , Valiant sees a newsreel detailing the sale of Maroon Cartoons to Cloverleaf , a mysterious corporation that bought the city 's trolley network shortly before Acme 's murder . Valiant goes to the studio to confront Maroon , leaving Roger to guard outside , but Jessica knocks him out and puts him in the trunk . Maroon tells Valiant that he blackmailed Acme into selling his company so that he could then sell the studio , but is shot dead before he can explain the consequences of the missing will . Valiant spots Jessica fleeing the scene and , assuming she is the culprit , follows her into Toontown . Jessica reveals that Doom killed Acme and Maroon , and that the former had given her his will for safe @-@ keeping , but she discovered that the will was blank . She and Valiant are then captured by Doom and the weasels . 
 At the Acme factory , Doom reveals his plot to destroy Toontown with a giant machine loaded with Dip to build a freeway , the only way past Toontown since Cloverleaf ( which Doom owns ) has bought out Los Angeles ' tram system . Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica , and the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine 's hose . Valiant then performs a comedic vaudeville act , causing the weasels to die of laughter ; Valiant kicks their leader , Smart Ass , into the machine 's Dip vat . Valiant then fights Doom , who is eventually flattened by a steamroller , but survives . Re @-@ inflating himself , he reveals he is a toon in disguise — the same toon who killed Teddy . Valiant gets a hold of a toon mallet with a spring @-@ loaded boxing glove , and fires it at a switch that causes the machine to empty its Dip onto Doom , killing him . The empty machine crashes through the wall into Toontown , where it is destroyed by a train . Numerous toons run in to regard Doom 's remains , and Roger discovers that he inadvertently wrote his love letter for Jessica on Acme 's will , which was written in disappearing @-@ reappearing ink . Roger then shocks Valiant with a joy buzzer , and Valiant gives him a kiss , having regained his sense of humor . Valiant happily enters Toontown with Dolores , and Roger with Jessica , followed by the other toons . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant , an alcoholic private investigator who resents Toons . Executive producer Spielberg 's first choice for the role was Harrison Ford , but Ford 's price was too high . Bill Murray was also considered for the role ; however , due to his method of receiving offers for roles , he missed out . Eddie Murphy reportedly turned down the role and later regretted it . 
 Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom , the cold and power @-@ hungry judge of Toontown District 's Superior Court . Lloyd was cast because he previously worked with Zemeckis and Amblin Entertainment in Back to the Future . Lloyd compared his part as Doom to his previous role as the Klingon commander Kruge in Star Trek III : The Search for Spock , both being overly evil characters which he considered being " fun to play " . Lloyd avoided blinking his eyes while on camera in order to perfectly portray the character . 
 Charles Fleischer as the voice of Roger Rabbit , an A @-@ list Toon working for Maroon Cartoons , who is framed for the murder of Marvin Acme , and requests Eddie 's help in proving his innocence . To facilitate Hoskins ' performance , Fleischer dressed in a Roger bunny suit and " stood in " behind camera for most scenes . Animation director Williams explained Roger Rabbit was a combination of " Tex Avery 's cashew nut @-@ shaped head , the swatch of red hair ... like Droopy 's , Goofy 's overalls , Porky Pig 's bow tie , Mickey Mouse 's gloves and Bugs Bunny @-@ like cheeks and ears . " Fleischer also voices of Benny the Cab and two members of Doom 's Weasel Gang , Psycho and Greasy . Lou Hirsch , who supplied the voice for Baby Herman , was the original choice for Benny the Cab , but was replaced by Fleischer . 
 Stubby Kaye as Marvin Acme , the jester @-@ like owner of the Acme Corporation . 
 Joanna Cassidy as Dolores , Eddie 's on @-@ off girlfriend who works as a waitress . 
 Kathleen Turner provides the uncredited voice of Jessica Rabbit , Roger Rabbit 's beautiful and flirtatious Toon wife , She loves Roger because , as she says , " he makes me laugh " . Amy Irving supplied the singing voice , while Betsy Brantley served as the stand @-@ in . Alan <unk> , in his final film role , portrays R. K. Maroon , the short @-@ tempered and manipulative owner of " Maroon Cartoon " studios . Lou Hirsch provides the voice of Baby Herman , a mentally middle @-@ aged smoker baby and co @-@ star in Maroon Cartoons . Williams said Baby Herman was a mixture of " Elmer Fudd and Tweety crashed together " . April Winchell provides the voice of Mrs. Herman and the " baby noises " . Additionally , Richard <unk> has a minor role as Santino , a Lieutenant of the Los Angeles Police Department . Joel Silver has a cameo appearance as Raoul J. Raoul , a director frustrated with Roger Rabbit 's antics . Singer Frank Sinatra performed " Witchcraft " for the animated Singing Sword . David Lander voices Smart Ass , the leader of the weasels , Fred Newman voices Stupid and June Foray voices Wheezy . Foray also voiced Lena Hyena , a hag Toon woman who resembles Jessica Rabbit and provides a comical role which shows her falling for Eddie and pursuing him . She shares her name with the character from Lil ' Abner , but it 's unclear if it 's the same character Al Capp created . 
 Mel Blanc voiced Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck , Porky Pig , Tweety , and Sylvester ( Who Framed Roger Rabbit was one of the final productions in which Blanc voiced his Looney Tunes characters before his death the following year ) . Joe <unk> voiced Yosemite Sam ( in place of the elderly Blanc ) . Wayne <unk> voiced Mickey Mouse , Tony Anselmo voiced Donald Duck ( with an archival recording of Clarence Nash , the original voice of Donald , used at the beginning of the scene ) , Tony Pope voiced Goofy ( also partially voiced by Bill Farmer ) and The Big Bad Wolf , Mae <unk> reprised her role of Betty Boop , Russi Taylor voiced Minnie Mouse and some birds , Pat <unk> , Jim Cummings and Jim Gallant voiced Valiant 's animated bullets , Les Perkins voiced Mr. Toad , Mary Radford voiced Hyacinth Hippo from Fantasia , Nancy Cartwright voiced the <unk> shoe , Cherry Davis voiced Woody Woodpecker , Peter Westy voiced Pinocchio , and Frank Welker voiced Dumbo .

 Walt Disney Productions purchased the film rights to Gary K. Wolf 's novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit ? shortly after its publication in 1981 . Ron W. Miller , then president of The Walt Disney Company saw it as a perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster . Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were hired to write the script , penning two drafts . Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director in 1982 , but Disney acknowledged that his previous films ( I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Used Cars ) were box office bombs , and thus let him go . Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van <unk> as animation director , Paul Reubens voicing Roger Rabbit , Peter <unk> as Eddie Valiant , and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit . The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner , the then @-@ new CEO of Disney . Amblin Entertainment , which consisted of Steven Spielberg , Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy , were approached to produce Who Framed Roger Rabbit alongside Disney . The original budget was projected at $ 50 million , which Disney felt was too expensive . 
 Roger Rabbit was finally green @-@ lit when the budget decreased to $ 30 million , which at the time still made it the most expensive animated film ever green @-@ lit . Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg argued that the hybrid of live action and animation would " save " Disney 's animation department . Spielberg 's contract included an extensive amount of creative control and a large percentage of the box office profits . Disney kept all merchandising rights . Spielberg convinced Warner Bros. , Fleischer Studios , King Features Syndicate , Felix the Cat Productions , Turner Entertainment , and Universal Pictures / Walter Lantz Productions to " lend " their characters to appear in the film with ( in some cases ) stipulations on how those characters were portrayed ; for example , Disney 's Donald Duck and Warner 's Daffy Duck appear as equally @-@ talented dueling pianists , and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny also share a scene . Apart from this agreement , Warner Bros. and the various other companies were not involved in the production of Roger Rabbit . Additionally , the producers were unable to acquire the rights to use Popeye , Tom and Jerry , Little Lulu , Casper the Friendly Ghost or the Terrytoons for appearances from their respective owners ( King Features , Turner , Western Publishing , Harvey Comics and Viacom ) . 
 Terry Gilliam was offered the chance to direct , but he found the project too technically challenging . ( " Pure laziness on my part , " he later admitted , " I completely regret that decision . " ) Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct in 1985 , based on the success of Romancing the Stone and Back to the Future . Disney executives were continuing to suggest Darrell Van <unk> to direct the animated sequences , but Spielberg and Zemeckis decided against it . Richard Williams was eventually hired to direct the animation . Zemeckis wanted the film to imbue " Disney 's high quality of animation , Warner Bros. ' characterization and Tex Avery humor " . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Price and Seaman were brought aboard to continue writing the script once Spielberg and Zemeckis were hired . For inspiration , the two writers studied the work of Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Cartoons from the Golden Age of American animation , especially Tex Avery and Bob Clampett cartoons . The Cloverleaf streetcar subplot was inspired by Chinatown . Price and Seaman said that " the Red Car plot , suburb expansion , urban and political corruption really did happen , " Price stated . " In Los Angeles , during the 1940s , car and tire companies teamed up against the Pacific Electric Railway system and bought them out of business . Where the freeway runs in Los Angeles is where the Red Car used to be . " In Wolf 's novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit ? , the Toons were comic strip characters rather than movie stars . 
 During the writing process , Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot . They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain , but they made their final decision with newly created character Judge Doom . Doom was supposed to have an animated vulture sit on his shoulder , but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed . Doom also had a suitcase of 12 small animated kangaroos that act as a jury , by having their joeys pop out of their pouches , each with letters , which put together would spell YOU ARE <unk> . This was also cut for budget and technical reasons . Doom 's five @-@ man " Weasel Gang " ( Stupid , Smart Ass , Greasy , Wheezy and Psycho ) satirizes the Seven Dwarfs ( Doc , Grumpy , Happy , Sleepy , Bashful , Sneezy and Dopey ) who appeared in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) . There were originally seven weasels to mimic the dwarfs ' complement , but eventually two of them , <unk> and <unk> , were written out of the script . Further references included The " Ink and Paint Club " resembling the Harlem Cotton Club , while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom 's invention of " The Dip " to eliminate all the Toons as Hitler 's Final Solution . Doom was originally the hunter that killed Bambi 's Mother , but Disney objected to the idea . Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a Volkswagen Beetle before being changed to a Taxicab . Ideas originally conceived for the story also included a sequence set at Marvin Acme 's funeral , whose attendees included Eddie , Foghorn Leghorn , Mickey Mouse , Minnie Mouse , Tom and Jerry , Heckle and Jeckle , Chip n ' Dale , Mighty Mouse , Superman , Popeye , Olive Oyl , Bluto , <unk> Cow , and The Seven Dwarfs in cameo appearances . However , the scene was cut for pacing reasons and never made it past the storyboard stage . Before finally agreeing on Who Framed Roger Rabbit as the film 's title , working titles included Murder in Toontown , Toons , Dead Toons Don 't Pay Bills , The Toontown Trial , Trouble in Toontown , and Eddie Goes to Toontown .

 Animation director Richard Williams admitted he was " openly disdainful of the Disney bureaucracy " and refused to work in Los Angeles . To accommodate him and his animators , production was moved to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire , England . Disney and Spielberg also told Williams that in return for doing Roger Rabbit , they would help distribute his uncompleted film The Thief and the Cobbler . Supervising animators included Dale Baer , James Baxter , David Bowers , Andreas Deja , Chris Jenkins , Phil Nibbelink , Nik Ranieri , and Simon Wells . The animation production , headed by associate producer Don Hahn , was split between Richard Williams ' London studio and a specialized unit in Los Angeles , set up by Walt Disney Feature Animation and supervised by Dale Baer . The production budget continued to escalate while the shooting schedule lapsed longer than expected . When the budget reached $ 40 million , Disney president Michael Eisner seriously considered shutting down production , but Jeffrey Katzenberg talked him out of it . Despite the budget escalating to over $ 50 million , Disney moved forward on production because they were enthusiastic to work with Spielberg . 
 VistaVision cameras installed with motion control technology were used for the photography of the live @-@ action scenes which would be composited with animation . Rubber mannequins of Roger Rabbit , Baby Herman and the Weasels would portray the animated characters during rehearsals in order to teach the actors where to look when acting with " open air and imaginative cartoon characters " . Many of the live @-@ action props held by cartoon characters were shot on set with either robotic arms holding the props or the props were manipulated by strings , similar to a marionette . The voice of Roger , Charles Fleischer , insisted on wearing a Roger Rabbit costume while on the set , in order to get into character . Filming began on December 2 , 1986 , and lasted for seven months at Elstree Studios , with an additional month in Los Angeles and at Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) for blue screen effects of Toontown . The entrance of Desilu Studios served as the fictional Maroon Cartoon Studio lot . 
 = = = Animation and post @-@ production = = = 
 Post @-@ production lasted for fourteen months . Because the film was made before computer animation and digital compositing were widely used , all the animation was done using cels and optical compositing . First , the animators and lay @-@ out artists were given black and white printouts of the live action scenes ( known as " photo stats " ) , and they placed their animation paper on top of them . The artists then drew the animated characters in relationship to the live action footage . Due to Zemeckis ' dynamic camera moves , the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not " slipping and slipping all over the place . " After rough animation was complete , it would run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the rostrum camera with no background . The animated footage was then sent to ILM for compositing , where technicians would animate three lighting layers ( shadows , highlights and tone mattes ) separately , in order to make the cartoon characters look three @-@ dimensional and give the illusion of the characters being affected by the lighting on set . Finally , the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters , who were , in turn , composited into the live @-@ action footage . One of the most difficult effects in the film was Jessica 's dress in the night club scene , because it had flashing sequins , an effect accomplished by filtering light through a plastic bag scratched with steel wool . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Regular Zemeckis collaborator Alan Silvestri composed the film score , performed by the London Symphony Orchestra ( LSO ) under the direction of Silvestri . Zemeckis joked that " the British [ musicians ] could not keep up with Silvestri 's jazz tempo " . The performances of the music themes written for Jessica Rabbit were entirely improvised by the LSO . The work of American composer Carl Stalling heavily influenced Silvestri 's work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit . The film 's soundtrack was originally released by Buena Vista Records on June 22 , 1988 , and reissued by Walt Disney Records on CD on April 16 , 2002 .

 Michael Eisner , then CEO , and Roy E. Disney , Vice Chairman of the Walt Disney Company , felt Who Framed Roger Rabbit was too risqué with sexual references . Eisner and Zemeckis disagreed over various elements of the film , but since Zemeckis had final cut privilege , he refused to make alterations . Roy E. Disney , head of Feature Animation along with studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg , felt it was appropriate to release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner instead of the traditional Walt Disney Pictures banner . 
 Who Framed Roger Rabbit opened on June 22 , 1988 , in America , grossing $ 11 @,@ 226 @,@ 239 in 1 @,@ 045 theaters during its opening weekend , ranking first place in the domestic box office .

 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times gave the film four stars out of four , predicting it would carry " the type of word of mouth that money can 't buy . This movie is not only great entertainment but a breakthrough in craftsmanship . " Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune spent a considerable amount of time in the Siskel & Ebert episode in which they reviewed the film analyzing the film 's painstaking filmmaking . Siskel also praised the film , and ranked it # 2 on his top ten films list for 1988 , while Ebert ranked it as # 8 on a similar list . Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that " although this isn 't the first time that cartoon characters have shared the screen with live actors , it 's the first time they 've done it on their own terms and make it look real " . Desson Thomson of The Washington Post considered Roger Rabbit to be " a definitive collaboration of pure talent . Zemeckis had Walt Disney Pictures ' enthusiastic backing , producer Steven Spielberg 's pull , Warner Bros.

" Gene Shalit on the Today Show also praised the film , calling it " one of the most extraordinary movies ever made " . 
 Conversely , Richard Corliss , writing for Time , gave a mixed review . " The opening cartoon works just fine , but too fine . The opening scene upstages the movie that emerges from it , " he said . Corliss was mainly annoyed by the homages to the Golden Age of American animation . Animation legend Chuck Jones made a rather scathing attack on the film in his book Chuck Jones Conversations . Among his complaints , Jones accused Robert Zemeckis of robbing Richard Williams of any creative input and ruining the piano duel that both he and Williams storyboarded .

 The success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit rekindled an interest in the Golden Age of American animation , and sparked the modern animation scene . In 1991 , Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey 's Toontown for Disneyland , based on the Toontown that appeared in the film .

 Gary K. Wolf , author of the novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit ? , filed a lawsuit in 2001 against The Walt Disney Company . Wolf claimed he was owed royalties based on the value of " gross receipts " and merchandising sales . In 2002 , the trial court in the case ruled that these only referred to actual cash receipts Disney collected and denied Wolf 's claim . In its January 2004 ruling , the California Court of Appeal disagreed , finding that expert testimony introduced by Wolf regarding the customary use of " gross receipts " in the entertainment business could support a broader reading of the term . The ruling vacated the trial court 's order in favor of Disney and remanded the case for further proceedings . In a March 2005 hearing , Wolf estimated he was owed $ 7 million . Disney 's attorneys not only disputed the claim but said Wolf actually owed Disney $ 500 @,@ 000 – $ 1 million because of an accounting error discovered in preparing for the lawsuit . Wolf won the decision in 2005 , receiving between $ 180 @,@ 000 and $ 400 @,@ 000 in damages .

 With the film 's critical and financial success , Disney and Spielberg felt it was obviously time to plan a second installment . J. J. Abrams says that he met Spielberg in 1989 to discuss working on a Roger Rabbit sequel , to the extent of preparing an outline and storyboards . More substantial work was done by Nat Mauldin , who wrote a prequel titled Roger Rabbit : The Toon Platoon , set in 1941 . Similar to the previous film , Toon Platoon featured many cameo appearances by characters from the golden Age of American animation . It began with Roger Rabbit 's early years , living on a farm in the Midwestern United States . With human Richie Davenport , Roger travels west to seek his mother , in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick ( his future wife ) , a struggling Hollywood actress . While Roger and Ritchie are enlisting in the Army , Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro @-@ Nazi Germany broadcasts . Roger and Ritchie must save her by going into Nazi @-@ occupied Europe accompanied by several other <unk> in their Army platoon . After their triumph , Roger and Ritchie are given a Hollywood Boulevard parade , and Roger is finally reunited with his mother , and father : Bugs Bunny . 
 Mauldin later re @-@ titled his script Who Discovered Roger Rabbit . Spielberg left the project when deciding he could not satirize Nazis after directing Schindler 's List . Eisner commissioned a rewrite in 1997 with Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver . Although they kept Roger 's search for his mother , Stoner and Oliver replaced the WWII subplot with Roger 's inadvertent rise to stardom on Broadway and Hollywood . Disney was impressed and Alan Menken was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer . One of the songs , " This Only Happens in the Movies " , was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress Kerry Butler . Eric Goldberg was set to be the new animation director , and began to redesign Roger 's new character appearance . 
 Spielberg had no interest in the project because he was establishing DreamWorks , although Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy decided to stay on as producers . Test footage for Who Discovered Roger Rabbit was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in Lake Buena Vista , Florida ; the results were an unwieldy mix of CGI , traditional animation and live @-@ action that did not please Disney . A second test had the Toons completely converted to CGI ; but this was dropped as the film 's projected budget escalated well past $ 100 million . Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film . In March 2003 , producer Don Hahn was doubtful about a sequel being made , arguing that public tastes had changed since the 1990s with the rise of computer animation . " There was something very special about that time when animation was not as much in the forefront as it is now . " 
 In December 2007 , Marshall admitted he was still " open " to the idea , and in April 2009 , Zemeckis revealed he was still interested . According to a 2009 MTV News story , Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were writing a new script for the project , and the cartoon characters will be in traditional 2D , while the rest will be in motion capture . However , in 2010 , Zemeckis said that the sequel will remain hand @-@ drawn animated and live @-@ action sequences will be filmed , just like in the original film , but the lighting effects on the cartoon characters and some of the props that the toons handle will be done digitally . Also in 2010 , Don Hahn , who was the film 's original associate producer , confirmed the sequel 's development in an interview with Empire magazine . He stated , " Yeah , I couldn 't possibly comment . I deny completely , but yeah ... if you 're a fan , pretty soon you 're going to be very , very , very happy . " In 2010 , Bob Hoskins stated he was interested in the project , reprising his role as Eddie Valiant . However , he retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed with Parkinson 's disease a year earlier , and died from those complications in 2014 . Marshall has confirmed that the film is a prequel , similar to earlier drafts , and that the writing was almost complete . During an interview at the premiere of Flight , Zemeckis stated that the sequel is still possible , despite Hoskins ' absence , and the script for the sequel was sent to Disney for approval from studio executives . 
 In February 2013 , Gary K. Wolf , creator of Roger Rabbit , said that he , as well as Erik Von <unk> , were working on a development proposal for an animated Disney buddy comedy starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit called The Stooge , based on the 1952 film of the same name . The proposed film is set to a prequel , taking place five years before Who Framed Roger Rabbit and part of the story is about how Roger met Jessica , his future wife . Wolf has stated the film is currently <unk> its way through Disney .

 The Roger Rabbit became a popular dance move in the early 1990s . It was named after the floppy movements of the Roger Rabbit cartoon character . In movement , the Roger Rabbit dance is similar to the Running Man , but done by skipping backwards with arms performing a flapping gesture as if hooking one 's thumbs on suspenders . 
 = Orel Hershiser 's scoreless innings streak = 
 During the 1988 Major League Baseball season , pitcher Orel Hershiser of the Los Angeles Dodgers set the MLB record for consecutive scoreless innings pitched . Over 59 consecutive innings , opposing hitters did not score a run against Hershiser . During the streak , he averted numerous high @-@ risk scoring situations . The streak spanned from the sixth inning of an August 30 game against the Montreal Expos to the tenth inning of a September 28 game against the San Diego Padres . The previous record of 58 2 ⁄ 3 innings was set by former Dodger pitcher Don Drysdale in 1968 ; as the team 's radio announcer , Drysdale called Hershiser 's streak as he pursued the new record . Pundits have described the streak as among the greatest individual feats in sports and among the greatest records in baseball history . 
 During the streak , the Elias Sports Bureau changed its criteria for the official consecutive scoreless innings record for starting pitchers from including fractional innings in which one or two outs had been recorded to counting only complete scoreless innings . Since the streak was active at the end of the 1988 season , it would have spanned two separate seasons if Hershiser had pitched any additional scoreless innings to begin the next year . However , he yielded a run in his first inning of the 1989 season , thus ending the streak . The streak only includes innings pitched in the regular season , excluding eight scoreless innings Hershiser pitched to start Game 1 of the 1988 National League Championship Series on October 4 ( unofficially extending his streak to 67 combined innings ) . Although he completed the ninth inning in each start , the streak 's final game lasted 16 innings , of which he only pitched the first ten . Thus , Hershiser did not match Drysdale 's record of six consecutive complete game shutouts . Like Drysdale 's streak , the penultimate game of Hershiser 's streak was a Dodgers – Giants game that featured a controversial umpire 's ruling that saved the streak . 
 The streak was initially overshadowed by Hershiser achieving 20 wins and the race for the NL Cy Young Award between Hershiser and Danny Jackson until Hershiser reached 40 consecutive innings . Another distraction during the streak was his wife 's pregnancy and his son 's childbirth complications . The record @-@ setting game was overshadowed by the 1988 Summer Olympics , American football , and baseball pennant races ; it was not broadcast on local television in Los Angeles . Following the regular season , Hershiser was awarded the NL Cy Young Award . In the playoffs , he earned both the NL Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award and the World Series MVP Award . He also secured Sportsman of the Year and Associated Press Athlete of the Year honors . Hershiser appeared in the 1989 MLB All @-@ Star Game and continued to be an effective pitcher for many seasons , including two additional appearances in the World Series , one of which was preceded by his winning the 1995 AL Championship Series MVP Award .

 Hershiser had been drafted by Dodgers in the 17th round of the 1979 MLB draft with the <unk> overall selection . He made his professional debut with the Class A Dodger farm team in the Midwest League , the Clinton Dodgers in 1979 . He made his MLB debut for the Dodgers on September 1 , 1983 , against the Montreal Expos . <unk> made his first start on May 26 , 1984 , against the New York Mets and became a full @-@ time starter in the Dodgers ' rotation on July 14 . 
 Hershiser had pitched a 33 2 ⁄ 3 @-@ inning scoreless streak in 1984 , eventually joining Gaylord Perry and Luis Tiant as the only pitchers between 1963 and 2014 with at least two streaks of this length . Hershiser 's 1984 streak , which was the longest scoreless inning streak of the year , was broken up on July 24 by a home run by two @-@ time NL Most Valuable Player Dale Murphy of the Atlanta Braves . His streak included a blown save on July 8 against the St. Louis Cardinals and a nine @-@ inning shutout against the Cardinals on July 19 . 
 Despite an emergency appendectomy that delayed his spring training and shortened his time to get in shape for the season , Hershiser had been named NL Baseball Pitcher of the Month in April and a participant in the 1988 All @-@ Star Game , getting outs against all three batters . In the eight games he started between July 10 and August 14 , Hershiser had a 3 – 4 win – loss record with a 4 @.@ 76 earned run average ( ERA ) , raising his season ERA from 2 @.@ 46 to 3 @.@ 06 . Following his August 14 start where he left the game after two innings ( his shortest appearance since 1985 ) with the Dodgers behind the Giants 8 – 2 , he pitched complete games on August 19 ( a shutout ) and August 24 . Prior to the game , Hershiser trailed teammate Tim Leary in shutouts , six to three , and Leary also combined with other pitchers to record a shutout that was not counted in his individual total . 
 Previously , Walter Johnson of the 1913 Washington Senators had held the consecutive scoreless innings record , at 55 2 ⁄ 3 , with two relief appearances , which gave him a fractional total . In 1968 , Drysdale , also of the Dodgers , surpassed Johnson by pitching 58 2 ⁄ 3 innings in six consecutive nine @-@ inning shutouts between May 14 and June 4 , 1968 . Drysdale 's streak ended with four scoreless innings in a 5 @-@ 3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on June 8 . 
 = = The streak = = 
 The streak spanned Hershiser 's 29th through 35th ( and final ) starts of the 1988 season for the Dodgers , which were the 190th through 196th games of his career . It began on August 30 against the Expos , after seven @-@ time All @-@ Star Tim Raines scored with two outs in the 5th inning . The streak ended on April 5 , 1989 against Cincinnati , when Baseball Hall of Famer Barry Larkin scored with two outs in the first inning . During the streak , although forty @-@ one of the 59 scoreless innings came on the road away from traditionally pitcher @-@ friendly Dodger Stadium , Hershiser lowered his ERA from 2 @.@ 90 to 2 @.@ 26 . The Dodgers only scored 13 runs in support of Hershiser 's 59 innings . Overall , opposing hitters batted 0 @-@ for @-@ 9 with runners on third and 0 @-@ for @-@ 31 with runners in scoring position . During the streak , according to the Chicago Tribune , Hershiser caused opposing teams to leave 30 runners on base ; Drysdale , in his streak , left 35 . However , USA Today reported that Hershiser left 36 runners on base . At that point in his career , Hershiser was regarded as a " right @-@ handed <unk> artist " although he did not throw a sinker . He relied on a fastball , slider , curveball , and a split @-@ finger fastball , the latter of which he used as a sinker . 
 Once Hershiser achieved his second consecutive complete @-@ game shutout to reach 22 consecutive scoreless innings , he was lauded for his 20th win in the national press while the local press praised his serious contention for the Cy Young Award , given to the league 's best pitcher . The 20th win had been his preseason goal . His third consecutive complete @-@ game shutout , which brought him to 31 consecutive innings , was said in local newspapers to have strengthened his Cy Young Award chances and in national newspapers to have helped his team in the pennant race . There was little emphasis on the historical context of his streak at this point , even among newspapers that headlined the streak . Upon reaching 40 consecutive innings , most of the national media began to mention that the record was 58 ( in some cases 58 2 ⁄ 3 ) . In some papers , Hershiser 's approach to the record was being described as a chase . Hershiser , however , said that he was primarily focused on his hospitalized newborn son . 
 After Hershiser reached 49 consecutive innings because of what some sources describe as an umpire 's favorable interference ruling on a double play , the sports media compared him to Drysdale , who had a similar incident occur during his streak . The Houston Chronicle noted that both beneficial calls were in Dodgers – Giants games . However , the press also noted that Hershiser needed another complete game shutout to tie Drysdale and pass Johnson on the all @-@ time consecutive scoreless innings list . In addition to covering the record pursuit , some sportswriters perceived that Hershiser had taken a commanding lead in the Cy Young Award race . Despite the official ruling by MLB statistician Seymour Siwoff that only full innings of starting pitchers count toward the record , some of the press continued to refer to the record as 58 2 ⁄ 3 innings . The pennant race also continued to draw attention as the Dodgers closed in on the NL West division title . An Associated Press article noted that it was Hershiser 's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser 's fifth consecutive complete game shutout . As Hershiser 's last remaining start approached , the media mentioned that he needed one more complete game shutout to tie the all @-@ time record . When the total reached 49 , Hershiser first began to feel that the record was within reach . Not only were his teammates too superstitious to talk to him about the streak , Dodgers announcer Drysdale also avoided the subject when talking to Hershiser for fear of <unk> him . Hershiser was not superstitious about the record , saying , " I 'm pretty <unk> @-@ <unk> about it ... I talk about it all the time . I 'm not superstitious . "

Hershiser contributed a two @-@ run double in the second inning to help the Dodgers build a 3 – 0 lead . After Hershiser gave up two runs in the fifth , no baserunners reached second base against him in the final four innings , thus marking the first four scoreless innings of his streak . The game marked Hershiser 's third consecutive and tenth complete game of the season . Following the game , his 2 @.@ 84 ERA ranked third on the team behind Tim Leary ( 2 @.@ 44 ) and John Tudor ( 2 @.@ 37 ) .

 Hershiser had been scheduled to pitch against the NL @-@ leading New York Mets ( 80 – 54 ) on Sunday , September 4 , but a rainout delayed his performance .

With the September 5 win , the Dodgers retained their 5 @-@ game lead . Hershiser struck out Dale Murphy four times , once resorting to a rare sidearm curveball to do so , to the dismay of pitching coach Ron Perranoski , who worried about injuries caused by sidearm pitching . According to ESPN 's Mark Simon , this was the only game of Murphy 's 2 @,@ 180 @-@ game career in which a single pitcher struck him out four times . After a two @-@ out walk to Dion James in the third inning , Hershiser allowed no baserunners until the ninth inning .

With the September 10 win , the Dodgers held a five @-@ game lead . Although left @-@ handed pitcher Fernando Valenzuela had won 20 games in 1986 , Hershiser became the first Dodger <unk> to win 20 games since Don Sutton in 1976 . Hershiser said , about reaching this accomplishment , " It 's a goal that the world sets as a standard , and when you reach it , it 's a great feeling " . In the Cy Young Award race , Danny Jackson of the Reds had beaten the Dodgers the night before to move to 21 @-@ 6 with a 2 @.@ 43 ERA ( against Hershiser 's 20 @-@ 8 with a 2 @.@ 62 ERA ) . In the third inning , Hershiser struck out Eric Davis with the bases loaded and two outs and later got Davis to hit into two double plays .

 The Dodgers entered the game with an 83 – 60 record and a 6 @.@ 5 @-@ game lead in the NL West over the Astros , while the Atlanta Braves were 34 games back in 6th place in the division with a 49 – 94 record entering the game . With Hershiser 's September 14 win , the Dodgers maintained a 6 @.@ 5 @-@ game lead . Hershiser 's record on the season against the Braves was 5 – 0 with a 1 @.@ 29 ERA . The game marked only the third time in 1988 that he pitched on three days rest . With the streak at 31 innings Hershiser tied Jackson in number of wins , and moved into a tie for the sixth longest scoreless streak for the franchise since the 1958 relocation to Los Angeles . Although Drysdale 's record was mentioned after he reached 31 consecutive innings , the focus of the media was on the Cy Young Award race with Jackson . The win was Hershiser 's seventh consecutive against the Braves , a streak that began on September 13 , 1987 . 
 The Braves opened the third inning with back @-@ to @-@ back singles by Ozzie Virgil and Terry Blocker . Hershiser responded by striking out opposing pitcher Rick Mahler and Ron Gant and then retiring Jeff Blauser on a flyball to left . In the seventh inning , a double by Andrés Thomas was followed with an error by Franklin Stubbs , giving the Braves runners at first and third . Hershiser loaded the bases with an intentional walk before retiring Mahler and Gant again . Gant 's flyball sent Gibson to the outfield wall . Hershiser felt this was his worst outing of his six consecutive complete games saying : " It was the worst I 've thrown in the last five or six starts , ... I was really inconsistent . I didn 't have good stuff or location . I couldn 't establish a pattern . I had to work hard adjusting and got away with pitches I wouldn 't have if I was going badly . " The Dodgers ' only run came in the ninth inning on a successful hit and run play in which Mike Marshall doubled Kirk Gibson in from first base . Orel and wife Jamie , scheduled induced labor for the following day , an off day for Hershiser .

 The Dodgers entered the game with an 86 – 61 record and a nine @-@ game lead in the NL West over the Astros and Giants who each held a 78 – 71 record . With the September 19 win , the Dodgers held a 9 @.@ 5 @-@ game lead over the Reds . The game marked Hershiser 's second consecutive 1 – 0 victory . The game marked Nolan Ryan 's final start for the Astros . He pitched two innings ( striking out four Dodgers ) before leaving the game because of a hamstring cramp . Hershiser retired the final 13 batters in a row . Based on the rules in place on September 20 , Hershiser would have ended up 2 / 3 inning shy of Drysdale record even with two nine @-@ inning shutouts in his final two starts . Jackson also won his 22nd game that night . Hershiser 's ERA in the seven consecutive complete games had fallen to 0 @.@ 57 . Houston 's strongest scoring opportunities came about because of Dodger errors : Kevin Bass recorded a two @-@ out single followed by a stolen base . Then a Griffin error on a Glenn Davis ground ball moved the runner to third base and dangerously close to home plate . Also , in the fifth inning Stubbs ' error put runners on first and second with no outs . The game marked Hershiser 's sixth ( and fourth consecutive ) shutout of the season , making him the first Dodger since Drysdale in 1968 to record four in a row . This September 19 performance was the middle of three consecutive shutouts posted by the Dodgers . Tudor posted one on September 18 with relief from Alejandro Peña ; Tim Belcher pitched a shutout on September 20 . 
 On September 19 , Hershiser 's four @-@ day @-@ old son Jordan was suffering from fluid buildup in his lungs in a Pasadena hospital . Hershiser , by winning that day reduced the Dodgers ' magic number to five over the Reds . Publications such as The New York Times , Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times began to take note of the streak length and the nearer horizon of the record as Hershiser reached 40 consecutive innings with this win . Several Canadian newspapers even used the word chasing to note Hershiser ' progress — e.g. , The Ottawa Citizen ran a story titled " Hershiser chasing record " . 
 = = = September 23 , 1988 = = = 
 In order that Hershiser and the rest of the staff could have their normal number of days of rest heading into the playoff series that could start as early as October 3 , Hershiser pitched on only three days rest rather than making his regular start on September 24 . The Dodgers entered the game with an 89 – 63 record and an 8 @-@ game lead in the NL West over the Cincinnati Reds , while the San Francisco Giants were 10 @.@ 5 games back in fourth place in the division with a 79 – 74 record entering the game . With the September 23 win , the Dodgers retained an 8 @-@ game lead over the Reds . The victory reduced the Dodgers ' magic number to two . The game marked Hershiser 's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser 's fifth consecutive complete game shutout , which stretched his consecutive scoreless inning streak to 49 . Following the game , Hershiser was quoted as saying " I want to keep putting zeroes up there — not because of the streak , but for the team ... I want to stay hot right up through the playoffs . " 
 Prior to the start , Seymour Siwoff , the Elias Sports Bureau chief and official statistician for MLB , determined that the official method of accounting for consecutive scoreless innings would only count whole innings for starting pitchers and that if the streak extended into 1989 it would bear an asterisk . Previously there had been division among various sources on whether to include fractional innings . According to some sources , official statisticians such as Siwoff had a long history of only counting complete scoreless innings by starting pitchers . Hershiser 's September 23 shutout moved him to third on the all @-@ time consecutive scoreless innings list , behind Johnson and Drysdale . He also passed Carl Hubbell and G. Harris " Doc " White , who each had streaks of 45 innings on the newly redefined record 's list and Bob Gibson , who had a streak of 47 before the record was redefined . Hershiser also became one of three pitchers to throw five consecutive shutouts , joining Drysdale , who did it in 1968 and White , who did it in 1904 . His 23 wins were the most by a Dodger since Sandy Koufax had won 27 games in 1966 . 
 During the third inning of the September 23 game , according to articles written by ESPN and the Los Angeles Times , after José Uribe and Atlee <unk> got on base with consecutive singles , Brett Butler grounded into a force out at second base to leave Uribe on third and Butler on first . When Ernie <unk> hit a groundball , Butler interfered with Dodger shortstop Alfredo Griffin causing a bad throw and breaking up the double play . A run was posted on the scoreboard after Uribe crossed home plate . However , Bob Engel ruled the double play had been broken up by interference , making the play a double play . This allowed the streak to continue beyond 42 innings . Contemporaneous sources such as The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times noted that when Butler swiped at Griffin 's leg , Griffin threw over the head of Tracy Woodson . Other contemporaneous sources such as Sports Illustrated and USA Today said that Paul Runge ruled that Butler had interfered with second baseman Steve Sax ' relay throw to Griffin . Several sources noted that late in Drysdale 's streak , Drysdale benefited similarly when Harry <unk> nullified Dick Dietz ' bases loaded hit by pitch for failing to attempt to avoid the pitch . 
 Hershiser retired the side in order in the fourth , fifth and sixth innings . In the game , Giants manager Roger Craig made what some describe as a questionable pinch hitting substitution . In order to contest Hershiser with a left @-@ handed batter , with runners on first and second and one out , he substituted rookie Francisco Meléndez ( batting .190 ) for Robby Thompson ( batting .266 ) , which resulted in an inning @-@ ending double play . That day , USA Today claimed Dodgers ' manager Tommy Lasorda had determined his postseason pitching rotation with Hershiser slated for game one of the NLCS , but Lasorda denied having any plan in place for a playoff appearance that had not yet been clinched . The Dodgers ' runs came on Mickey Hatcher 's first home run of the season in the eighth inning . 
 = = = September 28 , 1988 = = = 
 As his turn in the rotation approached , Hershiser joked that he would skip a start and rest for the playoffs rather than pursue the record . The Dodgers had clinched the NL West on September 26 . Thus , the focus of the game on the 28th was on Hershiser 's need to get nine scoreless innings to tie Drysdale , which was Hershiser 's hope . On September 27 , Lasorda announced the Dodger starting pitchers for games one ( Hershiser ) and game two ( Tudor ) of the NL Championship series , which would begin the following Tuesday , October 4 . The Dodgers entered the game with a 92 – 65 record and a seven @-@ game lead in the NL West over the Cincinnati Reds , while the San Diego Padres were 13 games back in fifth place in the division with a 79 – 78 record entering the game . With the September 28 loss , the Dodgers retained a seven @-@ game lead over the Reds . In the off days leading up to Hershiser 's last start , Frank Viola had tied Jackson and Hershiser at 23 wins for the MLB lead . 
 Hershiser had ended Padres catcher Benito Santiago 's 34 @-@ game hitting streak the year before and the Padres were eager to snap Hershiser 's streak . Santiago 's streak was an MLB record for a catcher , an MLB record for a rookie and a team record for the Padres . No one who has started a hitting streak at age 22 or younger has matched the streak since . According to Tony Gwynn , " We wanted so badly to put a run on the board ... Maybe , we tried a little too hard . You have to give the man credit . He didn 't give me one decent pitch to hit all night . He put everything right where he wanted it to go . " 
 Prior to the game Hershiser explained why he wanted to win a World Series more than break the scoreless innings streak : " You can break a record or win a Cy Young and go home and celebrate with your wife and friends , but after it 's over there 's only a few people that really care about it . But if you win a team thing , you 've got 24 guys and all their families , all their friends , a whole city celebrating . " 
 Hershiser picked Roberto Alomar off at first base to end the eighth inning . When the game went into extra innings , Hershiser did not want to continue : " I really didn 't want to break it " , Hershiser said . " I wanted to stop at 58 . I wanted me and Don to be together at the top . But the higher sources ( Lasorda and Perranoski ) told me they weren 't taking me out of the game , so I figured , what the heck , I might as well get the guy out . " Through the first nine innings , no Padre had reached second base . Lasorda , Perranoski and Ben Hines all felt he owed it to the game and to himself to continue . Hershiser made it through the tenth inning , with the record @-@ setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball caught by right fielder José González . However , he had some close calls in a couple of innings . Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning , but reached first base after a wild pitch evaded catcher Mike Scioscia . The following two hitters , Santiago and Randy Ready , moved Wynne over to third with two outs . Then , Garry Templeton was given an intentional base on balls . Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded . 
 Even after achieving the record , Hershiser expressed regret : " Because of respect for Don and respect for the record , I don 't think I should have walked to the mound in a situation where I 'm supposed to be resting for the playoffs , just to beat a record . That would have tarnished the whole thing . " According to some sources , Drysdale was the person who convinced Hershiser to take the mound for the tenth inning , saying , " I gave him a kick in the pants and told him to get out there and go as far as he can " . However , other sources state that Drysdale merely said that if he had known about Hershiser 's hesitance to break the record , he would have reassured him , saying " I 'd have kicked him right in the rear if I had known that ... I 'd have told him to get his buns out there and get them . " 
 When the tenth inning ended , giving Hershiser the record , he " stood bent with his hands on his knees for a long moment after the final out and then was inundated by teammates pouring out of the dugout to congratulate him . " Drysdale served as the Dodger radio broadcast announcer with Vin Scully that year . As Hershiser left the mound with the record in hand , he was searching for Drysdale and saying " Where is Drysdale ? I 've got to find Drysdale " . Drysdale was on hand to congratulate Hershiser after the game . In fact , when Hershiser returned to the dugout , Drysdale was waiting with his microphone for an interview . 
 During Hershiser 's streak he posted 59 IP , 0 runs , 31 hits , 38 strikeouts , 10 walks , and 3 extra @-@ base hits , while Drysdale had posted 58 IP , 0 runs , 28 hits , 45 strikeouts , 10 walks , and 3 extra @-@ base hits . Drysdale maintained the record for consecutive shutouts ( 6 ) because Hershiser did not pitch beyond the first 10 innings of his September 28 start because it lasted 16 innings . Hershiser 's record was overshadowed because the 1988 Summer Olympics and the start of the 1988 National Football League season occurred at the same time . Los Angeles had two NFL teams at the time ( Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Raiders ) . Additionally , baseball fans were more concerned with pennant races . Furthermore , four of the final five games in the streak were played in the Pacific Time Zone , limiting the games ' visibility to the rest of the country . Controversially , KTTV channel 11 did not broadcast either the September 26 game in which the Dodgers clinched the NL West or the September 28 game in which Hershiser set the record . Instead , it showed Friday the 13th and The Funhouse on September 26 and 28 , respectively . The record @-@ setting game drew an attendance of 22 @,@ 596 .

 The New York Mets concluded the regular season with a record of 100 – 60 while the Dodgers had a 94 – 67 record . The Mets had won ten of the eleven head @-@ to @-@ head regular season contests and were the favorite in the series . On October 4 , 1988 , Hershiser posted eight scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1988 NL Championship Series ( bringing his unofficial total of consecutive scoreless innings to 67 ) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning . In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the next hitter hit an infield groundball against Hershiser . When Gregg Jefferies got a sinker down the middle , he led off the ninth inning with a single and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with Keith Hernandez . Jefferies recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser . With Jefferies on second , Darryl Strawberry posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in the strike zone . Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball . After Hershiser gave up a run in the ninth inning 100 pitches into his performance , pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signalling for a double switch before getting to the mound to talk to Hershiser . The Dodgers ' bullpen had led the league in saves that year . Howell had recorded 18 consecutive scoreless innings in relief . Howell 's scoreless streak was longer in calendar days , his last runs allowed occurring on August 11 . It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser . Controversially , Mets pitcher David Cone attributed Hershiser 's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in the ninth inning . The Mets went on to add two more runs on a ball that John Shelby could not secure until it first hit the ground . The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch , yielding the tying and winning runs . Despite the results , Hershiser 's scoreless inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings , as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason .

 The Dodgers entered the game with a 0 – 1 record , having lost to the Reds , who were 1 – 0 the day before . As Hershiser prepared for his first start , he said that the continuation of the streak via the asterisk did not mean much to him and that in his mind the streak was already over . His mound opponent was Tom Browning who had pitched a perfect game the last time he had faced the Dodgers ( September 16 , 1988 ) . Todd Benzinger drove in Larkin to end Hershiser 's streak in the first inning and Hershiser was tagged with his first loss since August 24 . The Dodgers endured three errors and a passed ball in the game . <unk> hitter Larkin chopped a groundball over Hershiser into centerfield . Hershiser 's pick off throw hit Larkin 's armpit . After Hershiser retired Chris Sabo and Eric Davis via strikeout , he walked Kal Daniels , who had a career .500 batting average and four home runs against Hershiser , on four pitches . Then Benzinger , who Hershiser was not familiar with , singled through the right side of the Dodger infield to score Larkin thus ending Hershiser 's streak . Howell did not allow an earned run in his second 1989 outing on April 10 . Thus , Howell 's streak went from August 11 , 1988 , through April 9 , 1989 . 
 = = Reaction and outcome = = 
 It had been unlikely that Hershiser would ever became a successful pitcher . He was unable to make his high school varsity team until he was a junior , and he went undrafted as a high schooler . He failed to make the Bowling Green State University team as a freshman , and after graduating , he struggled through two years in both Double A and Triple A baseball . Drysdale said that he enjoyed rooting for Hershiser because his jersey number , 55 , like Drysdale 's own number , 53 , indicated that Hershiser had been a long shot to make the majors ( lower numbers were generally assigned to better prospects in those days ) . After the record was broken , Drysdale said he was not surprised that his record was broken . Even though Hershiser had the second @-@ best ( behind Dwight Gooden ) career ERA among active pitchers , he believed that someone would surpass the record because he did not feel he was that great a pitcher , saying , " I think someone 's going to break it from me because I know I 'm not any big deal " . 
 After his NLCS game one performance , Hershiser went on to post a 21 1 ⁄ 3 scoreless innings streak in the 1988 NL Championship Series and 1988 World Series , winning both the NL Championship Series Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) Award and the World Series MVP Award . Hershiser also won the 1988 NL Cy Young Award . Hershiser 's season was recognized outside of baseball as well . He earned the Sportsman of the Year from Sports Illustrated in December and Associated Press Athlete of the Year in January 1989 , becoming the first non @-@ Olympian to win the award in an Olympic year in 20 years . After seeking arbitration in January , Hershiser signed a new three @-@ year , $ 7 @.@ 9 million contract on February 16 . Hershiser 's annual salary of $ 2 @,@ 766 @,@ 667 ( equal to $ 5 @,@ 281 @,@ 549 in 2016 dollars ) moved him ahead of Cal Ripken as baseball 's highest @-@ paid player at the time . Following his success of the 1988 season , Hershiser realized any future exploits would be seen comparatively as a failure , even as he began spring training in 1989 with the streak still active . 
 Hershiser 's combined single @-@ season total of 309 2 ⁄ 3 innings pitched including both the regular season and postseason has not been surpassed since 1988 . Nonetheless , he would lead the NL in innings pitched for a third consecutive season in 1989 . Hershiser 's statistics in 1989 were nearly identical to 1988 except for his win – loss record . Two wins during the 1988 streak were against the Atlanta Braves . Hershiser would eventually win twelve consecutive decisions against the Braves ( a post @-@ 1920 record for a pitcher against a single franchise ) . His 1 – 0 win on September 14 over the Braves and 1 – 0 win over the Astros on September 19 were the last of his three career 1 – 0 victories . After posting seven shutouts in his previous eleven starts , he was only able to tally six more in his remaining 319 career starts . Hershiser was selected to the 1989 MLB All @-@ Star Game and also contributed to two Cleveland Indians World Series runs ( 1995 and 1997 ) , earning another League Championship Series MVP in 1995 .

 Sports historians consider Hershiser 's record to be among the greatest streaks in sports history and among baseball 's most outstanding records . ESPN 's Jeff <unk> named it the third @-@ greatest individual streak in sports history , behind Joe DiMaggio 's 56 @-@ game hitting streak and Edwin Moses ' 107 straight hurdles finals wins . In Baseball 's Top 100 : The Game 's Greatest Records by Kerry Banks , Hershiser 's streak is ranked as the seventh @-@ greatest baseball record . 
 The record that Hershiser broke was regarded as " one of the most unbreakable records in baseball " . In 2013 , the 25th anniversary of Hershiser 's record @-@ breaking season was widely heralded in the press . ESPN , Los Angeles Daily News , and SB Nation are among the media outlets that covered the anniversary . SB Nation ran stories on the 25th anniversary of each of Hershiser 's starts during the streak . Baseball Digest celebrated the accomplishment with stories during the 10th , 15th and 20th anniversary seasons . 
 = = Subsequent challenges = = 
 In the first 25 years after Hershiser recorded his streak , the closest challenge came from Brandon Webb of the 2007 Arizona Diamondbacks , who pitched 42 consecutive scoreless innings . Greg Maddux and Kenny Rogers were the only other pitchers to have reached 39 innings during that time period . 
 R. A. Dickey threw a streak of more than 32 consecutive scoreless innings that broke the Mets franchise record in 2012 . The streak was snapped by baseball etiquette against " running up the score " ; Mets manager Terry Collins opted not to position his infield in with a runner on third and one out with a 9 – 0 lead , allowing a routine ground ball hit to score a runner and end Dickey 's streak . 
 In 2014 , Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw pitched 41 consecutive scoreless innings , before giving up a solo home run to Padres ' Chase Headley on July 10 . In 2015 another Dodger , Zack Greinke , maintained a streak of 452 ⁄ 3 consecutive innings without allowing a run . It ended on July 26 . 
 = Cyclone Rewa = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Rewa affected six countries and caused 22 deaths on its 28 @-@ day journey across the South Pacific Ocean in December 1993 and January 1994 . Cyclone Rewa developed from a tropical disturbance on 28 December south of Nauru . After forming , Rewa moved southwest through the Solomon Islands , crossing the 160th meridian east from the South Pacific basin into the Australian region . The cyclone began to strengthen steadily and turned southward , paralleling the eastern Australian coast through 31 December . Rewa reached its initial peak intensity as a Category 4 tropical cyclone on 2 January . It maintained this intensity for about 12 hours before an increase in wind shear induced its weakening by 3 January . The cyclone turned southeastward and moved back into the South Pacific basin on 4 January , before it passed over New Caledonia between 5 – 6 January . After affecting New Caledonia , Rewa weakened to a tropical depression and turned northwestward before re @-@ entering the Australian basin on 10 January . 
 Over the following days , the cyclone showed signs of restrengthening and executed an elongated cyclonic loop to the southeast of Papua New Guinea . Rewa subsequently entered a phase of quick intensification while proceeding southeastward , peaking in intensity as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone . It recurved toward the southwest while gradually weakening for several days . Although forecasters had predicted Rewa to make landfall near Mackay , Queensland , the cyclone began interacting with an upper @-@ level trough on 18 January , causing it to divert to the southeast and move along the Queensland coast . Rewa transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on 20 January , with its remnants bringing heavy rain to New Zealand three days later . 
 The cyclone caused the deaths of 22 people on its course , affecting parts of the Solomon Islands , Papua New Guinea , Eastern Australia , New Caledonia , Vanuatu and New Zealand . Nine people in a banana dinghy en route to Rossel Island went missing at the height of the storm ; they were presumed drowned after wreckage from their boat turned up at the island . In Queensland , three people died in traffic accidents caused by the storm , and another fatality occurred when a boy became trapped in a storm pipe . One death took place in New Caledonia , while flooding caused eight drownings in Papua New Guinea . After this usage of the name Rewa , the name was retired . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 During 26 December , the Fiji Meteorological Service 's Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Nadi , Fiji ( TCWC Nadi ) , started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone about 575 km ( 355 mi ) to the south @-@ east of Nauru . Over the next few days the depression gradually developed and organised further , as it moved towards the west @-@ southwest under the influence of a north @-@ easterly steering flow . During 28 December , the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P , before TCWC Nadi reported that the system had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Rewa . Over the next few days , the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper @-@ level winds while it moved towards the south @-@ southwest , passing through the Solomon Islands on 29 December and affecting the southeastern islands of Papua New Guinea . As it moved through the Solomon Islands , Rewa moved out of the South Pacific basin and into the Australian region , where the Bureau of Meteorology 's Brisbane tropical cyclone warning centre ( TCWC Brisbane ) took the primary warning responsibility for the system . 
 On 30 December , the JTWC reported that Rewa had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale ( SSHS ) ; early the next day TCWC Brisbane reported that the system had developed into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone , and an eye became visible on satellite imagery . The system then abruptly turned and started to move towards the south parallel to the Queensland coast because of an interaction with an upper @-@ level trough of low pressure . On 2 January both the JTWC and TCWC Brisbane reported that Rewa had reached its peak intensity , with the JTWC reporting that Rewa had peaked with 1 @-@ minute windspeeds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) , equivalent to a category 4 tropical cyclone on the SSHS . Meanwhile , TCWC Brisbane reported that the system had peaked with 10 @-@ minute windspeeds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) with a central pressure of 920 hPa ( 27 @.@ 17 inHg ) , which made it a category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale . When the data was reanalyzed , TCWC Brisbane lowered their estimate of the wind speed to 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) , which made Rewa a category 4 severe tropical cyclone . Rewa remained at its peak intensity for 12 hours before the system started to weaken during 3 January , as strengthening upper level north @-@ westerlies increased vertical wind shear over the system . Throughout that day , the cyclone started to move towards the south @-@ east , before it started to take a more eastwards track as it approached 160 ° E. 
 During 4 January , Rewa moved back into the South Pacific basin and continued eastward as a weakening category 3 severe tropical cyclone , with TCWC Nadi estimating the 10 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds at 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . During the next day , its eye became obscured after the mountains of New Caledonia affected Rewa 's circulation by creating a hot and dry Foehn wind . TCWC Nadi reported that the system had weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone , while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become a tropical storm . The system subsequently made landfall in the vicinity of Saint Vincent Bay on New Caledonia 's south @-@ western coast , before it emerged near Thio from the east coast during 6 January . By 7 January , Rewa 's circulation had become exposed under the influence of upper level north @-@ westerlies ; as a result both the JTWC and TCWC Nadi reported that Rewa had weakened into a depression . Over the next 3 days , the residual low @-@ level circulation was steered towards the northwest and Papua New Guinea in a southeasterly trade wind flow generated by a powerful area of high pressure located between New Zealand and Kermadec Islands . During 10 January , Rewa 's remnants moved out of the South Pacific basin and back into the Australian region while starting to re @-@ intensify into a tropical cyclone , as a mid to upper level trough over eastern Australia increased in size . 
 As moved into the Australian region , Rewa began to move in a long arc to the northwest and then to the north , and on 13 January , both the JTWC and TCWC Port Moresby reported that the system had reintensified into a tropical cyclone around Papua New Guinea 's southern islands . Later that day , Rewa executed a sharp clockwise turn near <unk> Island and started to move towards the southeast and TCWC Brisbane 's area of responsibility while gradually intensifying further . During 15 January , TCWC Brisbane reported that the system had reintensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become equivalent to a category 1 tropical cyclone again . Later that day , the system started to rapidly intensify as an upper level trough approached the system . During the next day the JTWC reported that the system had peaked with 1 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) . TCWC Brisbane then reported later that day , that Rewa had peaked with 10 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) , which made it a category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale . After it had peaked in intensity the system recurved towards the south @-@ southwest , and started to gradually weaken . By 18 January the JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened into a tropical storm while throughout that day TCWC Brisbane assessed Rewa as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone . During the next day , TCWC Brisbane reported that Rewa had weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone as it recurved and started to move towards the south @-@ east about 265 km ( 165 mi ) to the east of Mackay , Queensland . Over the next couple of days the system moved towards the south @-@ southeast along the Queensland coast while maintaining its intensity . During 21 January , TCWC Brisbane and the JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened below cyclone strength , as the system moved back into the South Pacific basin for the third and final time . Rewa 's remnants were last noted late on 23 January , by TCWC Wellington , bringing heavy rain to New Zealand , while dissipating over water about 400 km ( 250 mi ) to the east of Wellington , New Zealand .

 The Solomon Islands were affected by the developing tropical cyclone between 28 – 30 December and was the first Island country to be impacted by Rewa . As it developed into a tropical cyclone on 28 December , the system passed to the north of the outer lying atolls of Malaita Province in the Solomon Islands . Rewa then passed over the southern tip of Malaita Island , before passing to the south of Guadalcanal Island and the north of Rennell Island during 29 December . 
 Cyclone Rewa started to affect New Caledonia on 5 January , before it passed over Grand Terre Island later that day . Rewa dumped over 300 mm ( 12 in ) of rain on parts of the archipelago , which made all of the major rivers overflow and burst their banks . Several landslides and a death were recorded within New Caledonia , while on the Loyalty Island of Mare , waves from Rewa partially destroyed the harbour wall at <unk> 's port . 
 The system had no effect on Vanuatu while it passed through the Solomon Islands between 28 – 30 December ; however the southern islands of Vanuatu were affected by the cyclone after it had passed through New Caledonia during 5 January . As it moved towards the north @-@ west between 6 – 8 January , Rewa brought high seas and strong winds to parts of the island nation including the provinces of <unk> and <unk> . Some damage was recorded to Port Villa 's harbours intertidal zone , as the system passed about 175 km ( 110 mi ) to the southeast of the city . 
 Between 19 – 24 January , Rewa 's remnants , a slow moving weather front over Fiordland and a southerly brought widespread rainfall and flooding to New Zealand 's South Island . In Westland , Fiordland and the Southern Lakes , landslides and flooding occurred on 21 January , while several roads and bridges were damaged . 
 = = = Papua New Guinea = = = 
 Cyclone Rewa affected Papua New Guinea on two separate occasions while it was active , with the cyclone first affecting the archipelago between 28 December and 1 January , before grazing the archipelago between 12 @-@ 14 January . Before Rewa affected the country , cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for <unk> , Rossel and Samarai islands , while authorities urged people not to go to beaches . As it affected the archipelago , Rewa brought heavy rainfall , high seas , and wind gusts of up to 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) to parts of the archipelago including <unk> , Rossel and Samarai islands . The hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems , with the cyclone blocking roads , destroying a church , bridges , homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and copra destroyed . In total , Cyclone Rewa left around 3500 people homeless and caused 17 deaths , 8 of which were due to flooding . Nine other people went missing while travelling to Rossel Island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with Rewa . They were later presumed dead by the National Disaster and Emergency Service , after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the boat . At 00 : 00 UTC on 30 December , the automatic weather station at Jingo on Rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . 
 = = = Australia = = = 
 During the opening days of 1994 , Rewa moved southwards parallel to the Queensland coast ; however , because it was located about 600 km ( 370 mi ) to the north @-@ east of Mackay , it was too far away from the coast for there to be any direct impact on Queensland . The only indirect impact was higher surf , from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards New Caledonia during 4 January . As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time , watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by TCWC Brisbane , who predicted a landfall near Mackay . On 18 January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people , while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter . A military training exercise that was due to take place in Shoalwater Bay had to be cancelled , with army personal evacuated to Rockhampton to avoid being cut off by flood waters . Along the coast , several ports including Gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm . 
 On 19 January Rewa started to affect Queensland with torrential rain and storm force windspeeds which caused some damage along the coast . However it did not make its predicted landfall near Mackay , instead it recurved to the south @-@ southeast and came to within 100 km ( 60 mi ) of the coast . Two men off <unk> 's coast were rescued from a fishing trawler by an army Black Hawk helicopter after high seas damaged the trawler 's propeller and snapped its heavy anchor chain , leaving it drifting helplessly in the cyclone 's path . The worst affected island was Lady Elliot as it bore the brunt of the wind , while on Heron Island , several rare trees and bird rookeries were either destroyed or severely damaged . As Rewa interacted with an upper trough of low pressure on 19 January , heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were observed in parts of Brisbane and the Gold Coast . Brisbane received over 144 mm ( 5 @.@ 7 in ) in just six hours , which led to some localised flash flooding in parts of the city and four deaths . Three of the deaths were from people crashing their cars , while the other death occurred when a person went surfing Brisbane 's flood water and got trapped in a storm drain . Within Brisbane , 100 homes and 20 cars were damaged by the flood waters , while a Sheffield Shield cricket match between Western Australia and Queensland was delayed , after The Gabba resembled a small lake . 
 = Amon Tobin = 
 Amon <unk> Santos de Araújo Tobin ( born February 7 , 1972 ) , known as Amon Tobin , is a Brazilian musician , composer and producer of electronic music . He is described as a virtuoso sound designer and is considered to be one of the most influential electronic music artists in the world . He is noted for his unusual methodology in sound design and music production . He has released seven major studio albums under the London @-@ based Ninja Tune record label . 
 In 2007 he released Foley Room , an album based entirely on the manipulation of field recordings . His latest album , 2011 's ISAM , included " female " vocals made from his own processed voice . His music has been used in numerous major motion pictures including The Italian Job and 21 . Tobin has created songs for several independent films , including the 2006 Hungarian film <unk> , and had his music used in other independent films such as the 2002 Cannes Palme d 'Or nominated Divine Intervention . A selection of his tracks were featured in commercial bumps on Toonami and in the 2005 anime <unk> , and he produced the musical scores to critically acclaimed video games Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell : Chaos Theory by Ubisoft in 2005 , and Sucker Punch 's Infamous in 2009 .

 Tobin was born in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . At the age of 2 , he and his family left Brazil to live in Morocco , the Netherlands , London , Portugal and Madeira . Tobin settled in Brighton , England as a teenager which remained his permanent residence until 2002 . There he began producing electronic music in his bedroom with samplers and other audio equipment such as an Amstrad Studio 100 4 @-@ track , although he was " not really involved in the [ music ] scene " at that time . While taking an editorial photography class at a university in Brighton , he responded to a magazine promotion for the London @-@ based Ninebar record label asking artists to send in demos of their songs . Ninebar signed Tobin to the label in 1996 after hearing his early work , and he traveled between his home in Brighton and the studios in London to produce his first official works . He also spent some time living in Montreal before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2008 . 
 Under his original moniker Cujo ( in Portuguese , the word for whose ) , he released a series of original compositions on 12 @-@ inch vinyl . AllMusic called them " head @-@ turning " in a review . Many of those tracks were later included on his first full @-@ length album Adventures in Foam , originally released in 1996 by Ninebar to a limited release of 5 @,@ 000 copies . 
 The larger Ninja Tune record label had been growing in the United Kingdom at the time with help from their successful artists such as DJ Food , <unk> Porcini , The <unk> , and Coldcut . DJ Food and <unk> Porcini noticed Tobin 's work on Adventures in Foam and prompted the label to approach him . Ninja Tune signed Tobin in late 1996 , this time under his abbreviated name " Amon Tobin " . The official Ninja Tune website has said that Adventures in Foam had been re @-@ released without permission by the US @-@ based Shadow Records that same year and that this unauthorized version , labeled the " US release " , included only 7 of the original songs , different cover art , and that some tracks were titled incorrectly . In 1997 Ninja Tune acquired the proper licenses from Ninebar and re @-@ released the album themselves . This version included the original album in its entirety , and a second disc containing previously unreleased material . As of 2008 , copies of Shadow Record 's " US version " are still sold by online retailer Amazon.com. Over the course of its production , Adventures in Foam has been reviewed favorably . Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media said that its break @-@ beat style " got totally out of hand " , but that it " never fails to let the listener know who 's in charge . " The album was released for a fourth time in 2002 , again by Ninja Tune . 
 = = = Defining albums ( 1997 – 2002 ) = = = 
 Over the next several years , Tobin released three albums . Bricolage , released in 1997 , was the culmination of two projects Tobin had started after his debut album earlier that year . His third album Permutation was released in 1998 . Independent radio stations aired Tobin 's pieces during the summer of 1998 to positive listener reaction from conventional jazz aficionados , who identified with the computer @-@ generated drums and composition . In the late 1990s , sample @-@ based music was becoming more popular with a wide range of emerging and developing genres , but Tobin himself was still largely unknown . Tobin 's style of music was not seen as definitively belonging to one genre or another . The critics that commented on Bricolage and Permutation gave them positive reviews and they are often mentioned , by later reviewers and interviewers , as classic albums of the time . Pitchfork Media acclaimed the use of jazz instrument samples , comparing him to famous composers Quincy Jones and Miles Davis . In a 1999 review , they awarded Bricolage a very rare 10 / 10 and said that it was " one of the most inventive records of the decade . " 
 Tobin released his fourth album , Supermodified in 2000 . The album is regarded as his most commercial album to date . Critic reviews were generally positive , with Pitchfork rating the album 9 @.@ 1 / 10 , and Stylus Magazine saying , " Not many studio @-@ bound electronic musicians could put forward such a vivid and dynamic statement or make it as entertaining and downright funky as Supermodified has managed to do . " 
 = = = Montreal ( 2002 – present ) = = = 
 In 2002 , Tobin relocated to Montreal , Canada where he had spent time previously at Ninja Tune 's North American Headquarters . Tobin lived in the industrial area of Old Montreal to avoid noise complaints from neighbors after dark . There he produced his fifth album Out From Out Where released that same year . This was his first album created primarily in a professional studio . He later released a single , Verbal , taken from Out From Out Where . Otis Hart of Dusted Magazine said that Tobin 's style of producing had come into its own . He acclaimed Tobin 's " refined sense of tempo " . 
 In January 2004 , Tobin was contracted by video game company Ubisoft Montreal to compose the soundtrack for the third installment of their critically successful Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell series , Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell : Chaos Theory . To facilitate using the music in a video game , where the level of action or plot can change in real @-@ time , each track was broken down by Tobin into four distinct but similar parts based on their level of intensity . The game 's developers could then use each section to provide music based on the actions of the player . Despite not being an official album in Tobin 's discography , it was considered a ground breaking work in the world of video game sound tracks described as " an entirely new era of media " by Tiny Mix Tapes 
 The album continued the trend Tobin started with Out From Out Where , as he used more field recordings during production . In addition to being included with the game , Ninja Tune released the score as an individual album in 2005 , titled Chaos Theory – Splinter Cell 3 Soundtrack , several months before the game 's release . It was received well , benefiting from a wider audience of reviewers in both the music and gaming industries . Ben Hogwood of MusicOMH.com applauded Tobin 's use of melody and texture , adding that he controlled the sounds with the " clarity of a classical orchestrator . " He later recorded a Dolby Digital 5 @.@ 1 surround sound version of the album with audio engineer Bobby <unk> in a dedicated Solid State Logic studio in Los Angeles . 
 Tobin 's sixth studio album , Foley Room , was released in 2007 . The title alludes to the " foley rooms " used by recording engineers and foley artists to record sound effects in the movie industry . On this album , Tobin concluded his transition away from prerecorded source material that started with Out From Out Where . All of the samples used for production were recorded by himself using an omnidirectional microphone . Recorded primarily in Montreal , San Francisco , and Seattle , the samples came from a wide range of sources including motorbikes , tigers , insects , and water falling from a tap . Also contributing to the album were the string quartet Kronos Quartet , drummer Stefan Schneider , and harpist Sarah Pagé . Foley Room 's use of field @-@ recordings was used to help promote the album , including two official pre @-@ release trailers posted to YouTube . Nate Dorr of PopMatters.com called it a " smooth , natural progression " from his work on Supermodified . The first single , " Bloodstone " , was released to the iTunes Music Store months before the rest of the album . Ninja Tune also published a DVD titled Foley Room : Found Footage which documented the recording process . 
 In 2008 , Tobin announced he was working on a new video game soundtrack for an " undisclosed PS3 title " . This was later revealed to be the PlayStation 3 exclusive game , <unk> , and in 2010 , Tobin announced that he would be working on the music for Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell : Conviction . Recent works include " Hey Mr. Tree " as a ' Bonus Joint ' to accompany his earlier ' Monthly Joint ' collection , a remix of <unk> 's " Machine Gun " released alongside remixes by 16 Bit and <unk> , and a collaboration with <unk> dubbed <unk> . <unk> has released a single " Fine Objects " . A new AT record has also been officially announced via <unk> , for which he is " researching and developing new production tools and techniques " and using " a whole new array of gadgetry from the past and the future " . 
 Amon Tobin 's sounds and samples are frequently used in the British car @-@ based TV show Top Gear , and his song " Four Ton Mantis " has been used in a few of the more recent Nissan <unk> and Juke advertisements . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Tobin is best known for his use of audio manipulation techniques , where any given source material is transformed to produce a new sound . His use of this technique has changed over the course of his career . On his original singles under Ninebar and his first three albums , Tobin acquired all of the sound sources to produce music from his personal collection of vinyl records . He manipulates the sounds with a combination of audio hardware and software such as Cubase , often leaving the original source unrecognizable in its new context . The majority of his early work focused on reordering the break beats from jazz and blues music into faster more complex patterns . Guido Farnell of <unk> , wrote about his use of this technique , saying that Tobin has " taken the art to new and dizzying heights . " His fifth album Out From Out Where , began the gradual shift away from prerecorded material by incorporating original guitar samples . His techniques began branching into technical sound design , taking break beats or single instruments , modifying specific frequencies , and producing new sounds . This trend continued through his video game score Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell : Chaos Theory Soundtrack , and by his sixth album , Foley Room , all of the source material was recorded in the field by himself . Speaking about the creativity of sample @-@ based music compared to traditional instruments , he says that " creative input is not determined by your source material but in how you edit and manipulate the sounds . " 
 Tobin experimented with various instruments . He does not come from a music family , nor has he had any formal training in music theory . About his music in general , Tobin says that he sees it as a " genuine " expression of the time he lives in , as he says that by contrast , blues , jazz , and Brazilian genres were " genuine " expressions of the 1960s . Despite his indirect connection with Brazilian genres , Tobin collaborated with a number of artists on Bebel Gilberto 's 2000 bossa nova album Tanto Tempo . Tobin 's albums are often compared to soundtracks , and he says that movies by David Lynch have influenced him . In addition , he has stated to like films by the Coen brothers , Dario Argento , and Roman Polanski . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 Tobin began performing live shows in clubs with other Ninja Tune artists after releasing his second album , Bricolage . His shows generally contained music that he had produced during his career , mixed with modified songs from drum and bass , hip @-@ hop , or other genres . Because his music was entirely produced in a studio with electronics , Tobin was not interested in adapting his music to suit a Live PA incorporating musicians . He instead used turntables which he felt had more in common with his approach to music production . He is known for building Dolby Digital 7 @.@ 1 surround sound speaker systems for his performances . 
 In 2011 Tobin has developed a live show in support of the album ISAM fitting his criteria for a performance that is both live and purely electronic . He told Wired Magazine " The idea was to integrate myself , quite literally , into an audio and visual presentation of the album , " . It incorporates the use of new video mapping techniques that are projected onto a large cubic structure from which Tobin performs . The show has been met with international acclaim described by Vice Magazine 's Creators Project as " revolutionizing the live music experience " . 
 Tobin has performed individual shows in many countries including tours in Europe , Australia , Japan , and the United States . His 2003 live performance in Melbourne , Australia was used for the fourth album in Ninja Tune 's Solid Steel series because Tobin was not available to record a studio mix at the time . Many songs from the original recording were omitted because of copyright issues with the original artists , including the R & B group Destiny 's Child . 
 A second Solid Steel album called Foley Room Recorded Live in Brussels was recorded in Brussels at the Ancienne Belgique in 2007 and was released for free in November 2008 . According to Tobin 's official website , " After months of back and forth and despite everyone 's best efforts the mix was in danger of being edited into the ground to accommodate big labels and publishers . Rather than release a compromised version commercially , the decision was made to give it away for free instead . "
