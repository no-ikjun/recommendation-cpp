 Marmarosa began his professional career around 1941 , joining the Johnny " Scat " Davis orchestra at the age of 15 or 16 . He was first mentioned in the national jazz press the following year , appearing in Down Beat magazine for his playing at a jam session . After touring , the Davis orchestra disbanded , so Marmarosa and others then joined Gene Krupa around the end of 1942 . After one 1943 Krupa performance in Philadelphia , Marmarosa was beaten into a coma by sailors who accused him of draft dodging . According to clarinetist Buddy DeFranco , who was also attacked by the men , " Dodo was always a little off but he seemed different after that beating . The head injury didn 't affect his playing , but I think it created psychological problems for him . " 
 After Krupa 's orchestra broke up in the middle of 1943 , Marmarosa played in Ted <unk> Rito 's band for at least a month that summer . He then moved to Charlie Barnet 's big band , where he stayed from October 1943 to March 1944 . Marmarosa 's recording debut was with Barnet in 1943 ; they recorded " The Moose " , a track described by Gunther Schuller as " a veritable masterpiece " on which the 17 @-@ year @-@ old pianist played an original blend of nascent bebop and Count Basie @-@ style minimalism . Marmarosa recorded some trio tracks with Krupa and DeFranco in 1944 . From April to October of that year he was with Tommy Dorsey , including for the orchestra 's appearance in the MGM film Thrill of a Romance . A Dorsey biographer indicated that the pianist was dismissed because the bandleader did not care for the modernistic facets of his playing . Marmarosa soon joined clarinetist Artie Shaw , with whom he stayed until November 1945 , as part of a big band and Shaw 's small band , the Gramercy Five . 
 From the early 1940s Marmarosa had searched for and experimented with advanced progressive forms of jazz , and had become increasingly attracted to bebop after meeting and jamming with the leaders of that new movement , Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker . In 1945 Marmarosa moved to Los Angeles . He was pianist in March of the following year for Parker 's first recordings for Dial Records . Two of the tracks recorded , " Ornithology " and " <unk> Suite " , have been included in the Grammy Hall of Fame . 
 Marmarosa recorded extensively as a sideman in the period 1945 – 47 , in both bebop and swing contexts . Leaders of these sessions included Wardell Gray , Lionel Hampton , Mel Tormé , Willie Smith , Lester Young , and , with Marmarosa as house pianist for Atomic Records , Slim Gaillard and Barney Kessel . With a few exceptions , however , Marmarosa only rarely played in public with the leaders whose studio recordings he appeared on during his time on the West Coast . Between the frequent recording sessions , he played " in big bands ( especially Boyd Raeburn and Tommy Pederson ) , at jazz concerts , as a soloist in nightclubs [ ... ] or jamming after hours . " Raeburn 's orchestra was a progressive group that used " modern arrangements seeking to bridge the gap between bop and advanced European music " . 
 Marmarosa made his first recordings as leader in 1946 , with trio tracks that included Ray Brown on bass and Jackie Mills on drums , and in a quartet with saxophonist Lucky Thompson added . He also recorded his only vocal track , " I 've Got News for You " , in the same year . In 1947 Marmarosa led a trio session for Dial with Harry <unk> on cello and Jackie Mills on drums ; these were the first pizzicato jazz cello recordings . In the same year , he featured in some of Gene Norman 's Just Jazz concerts , and was given Esquire magazine 's New Star ( piano ) award . 
 According to Mills , his housemate in 1946 – 47 , " Dodo was the most dedicated of players . He practiced an incredible amount of hours , often all day long . He wouldn 't stop to eat . He would eat at the piano with one hand and keep playing with the other . He had no other interests that I was aware of . He could play forever . " At this time , Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs , but his behavior was often eccentric . Mills reported that " Dodo was just a big kid [ ... ] He never really grew up because he never allowed anything but the piano to be important to him . The piano was his life . He heard things in his head that he wasn 't able to play and it frustrated him . Once , he got mad at the old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe . " 
 In the spring of 1948 Marmarosa returned to Pittsburgh because of illness . He toured again with " Scat " Davis ( April – July 1949 ) and Shaw ( September – November 1949 ) . He left Shaw 's band for the final time during one concert after they had twice played Shaw 's hit , " <unk> " , Marmarosa had threatened to leave if Shaw called for it again , and the leader had done so after the audience requested a third playing . Shaw reported that Marmarosa " was gentle and fragile , [ ... and ] never learned to deal with the world of a musician . " The pianist returned to Pittsburgh in 1950 , signed " a term contract " with Savoy Records , and recorded four trio sides for them in July , but the quality did not match his earlier playing . 
 = = = 1951 – 59 = = = 
 For around a decade , Marmarosa was much less active as a musician . Shaw and DeFranco raised the idea of psychiatric treatment , but the former was rebuffed by Marmarosa himself , and the latter by the pianist 's parents : " They were not reconciled to his needing professional help . They were from the old school , they saw it as a stigma . I got into a big argument about it with his father . He really blew up . " 
 In 1952 , two years after marrying , Marmarosa moved with his wife and their two daughters to California . The marriage was short lived , and he again returned to his parents ' home in Pittsburgh in the fall of that year . His ex @-@ wife remarried and asked him to allow her to change the children 's names in exchange for not having to pay her any more money ; following the advice of his parents , he signed the documents . A friend of his later stated that never seeing his children again " was the great blight of his life . It tore him apart " . Another friend commented more generally that , " After the marriage broke up , he seemed to lose the spark , the drive he once had " . 
 A tour of a few months in Charlie Spivak 's band in 1953 preceded Marmarosa being drafted into the army the following year . This exacerbated his problems : several months in a Veteran Administration hospital preceded his discharge , at which point he was in a poor psychological condition . Back in Pittsburgh , where he played locally from March 1956 , Marmarosa continued to be erratic , sometimes disappearing for weeks at a time , and giving his money away : " It was like he was on the road to self @-@ destruction " , commented trumpeter Danny Conn . Amateur recordings from the pianist 's concerts in Pittsburgh in 1958 were released four decades later by Uptown Records . 
 = = = 1960 – 2002 = = = 
 Marmarosa departed for California by car in 1960 , but problems with the vehicle halted him in Chicago . Promoter Joe Segal organized an Argo Records session for him there , but Marmarosa departed suddenly and the recording was delayed until the following year . The resultant trio music from two days in May was released as Dodo 's Back ! in 1962 . Leonard Feather described it as " required listening for anyone with a serious interest in the history of modern jazz piano " , but it failed to gain Marmarosa more than a brief resurgence of interest . He made his final studio recordings in 1962 . One album from these , Jug & Dodo , contained trio and quartet tracks , with saxophonist Gene <unk> ; it was released on Prestige Records more than a decade later . The other , in a quartet with trumpeter Bill Hardman , was released in 1988 . Segal commented that Marmarosa " didn 't talk much , was very mild @-@ mannered . He just drank an awful lot , shot and a beer all day long . It would 've put nine out of ten people under the table , but he was still walking around . " The pianist shuttled between Chicago and Pittsburgh for a time , then settled again in the latter . 
 Marmarosa continued to perform in Pittsburgh , albeit irregularly . Around 1963 , DeFranco dropped by ; he recalled that the pianist " would play brilliantly for half a tune , then just stop and walk away . He didn 't even know who I was " . Marmarosa 's last performance in public has been dated variously as occurring in 1968 or the early @-@ to @-@ mid 1970s . Diabetes contributed to his permanent retirement . " Even the resurgence of interest in bebop in the 1970s and 80s did not bring him back to national attention " , reported The New York Times . 
 For the rest of his life , Marmarosa alternated between living with his sister Doris ' family and in a veterans ' hospital , both in the Pittsburgh area . Some of his friends blamed Marmarosa 's family for keeping him in their home because of shame about his mental problems , and suggested that the family blamed musicians and music for his instability . Marmarosa himself did not explain his withdrawal from performing . Irritated by telephone calls from a fan seeking an interview in 1992 , Marmarosa passed on the news that he had died ; this led to premature obituaries being published in two British newspapers . He sometimes played piano in the family 's basement or for other residents at the hospital . His mother died in 1995 , after his father . Marmarosa died of a heart attack on September 17 , 2002 , in a veterans ' hospital in Pittsburgh . He was survived by his two sisters . 
 = = Playing style and influence = = 
 Pianist Dick Katz wrote that , " In the opinion of many , Dodo Marmarosa was the most gifted of all the pianists who figured in the bebop saga . Blessed with a beautiful legato touch and a fluid technique , he developed an original style , which [ ... ] blended perfectly with the bop idiom , as well as with earlier styles . He combined advanced chordal and scalar elements with graceful rhythmic phrasing . " 
 In some of his 1944 playing , Marmarosa was progressively bebop @-@ directed , employing melodies derived from the harmony and varying the rhythmic positioning of accents ; soon after , he added more space to his playing , using shorter sequences of notes than typical in bebop . Jazz critic Marc Myers , in comparing Marmarosa with other pianists of the early bebop period , observed that he was less aggressive than Bud Powell , and more expressive and complex than Al Haig , and that he " had a punctuating , full @-@ keyboard approach , developing ideas in the middle and widening out to express them . " 
 Critic and musician Brian Priestley wrote that " What was so distinctive about Dodo 's work was partly his harmonic sense and knowledge of the additional notes [ ... in bebop . ] Many pianists were trying to find ways to voice these satisfactorily in full chording , but none did so as pleasingly or as fluently as Marmarosa . Partly it was also the way he alternated between employing his hands together and in opposition to each other , and allied to this was his unusual time feeling . " 
 By the time of his 1960s recordings , Marmarosa had a more relaxed playing style . Biographers commented that " his even , classically derived articulation had given way to a more rhythmically pronounced , jazz @-@ oriented playing , and , above all , his musical personality seemed still more determined and coherent . " 
 Pianist Cecil Taylor commented in 1961 that " The first modern pianist who made any impression on me was Dodo Marmarosa , with Charlie Barnet . " Marmarosa also encouraged DeFranco to take up bebop .

Abused physically and emotionally by his father for her subsequent insanity , Cain poisoned him , after a dying Augusta warned him to escape . Before Alexis plunged into the sea , he cursed his son to have a miserable life and die alone . Cain inherited his father 's title of earl as a result of his presumed death . Accompanying him is his twenty @-@ eight @-@ year @-@ old butler <unk> " Riff " <unk> ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) , a former medical student with whom he shares a close bond . Cain 's uncle and legal guardian Neil Hargreaves ( <unk> ・ ハーグリーヴス , <unk> Hāgurīvuzu ) tends to become upset with his behavior and course of action . Often annoyed by Cain 's relationships with women , Cain 's ten @-@ year @-@ old half sister , the outgoing and <unk> Mary Weather Hargreaves ( <unk> ･ ハーグリーヴス , <unk> Hāgurīvuzu ) also lives with them . Previously , she lived on the streets as a fortuneteller , after her mother died to protect her . One of Cain 's friends , Oscar Gabriel , becomes her self @-@ proclaimed fiancé to win back his father 's attention . As the series progresses , he risks his life to protect her , and she realizes that he genuinely cares for her . 
 Alexis Hargreaves ( <unk> ・ ハーグリーヴス , <unk> Hāgurīvuzu ) and his secret organization , Delilah , serve as the antagonists of the series . Delilah conducts experiments to revive the dead , creating " deadly dolls " or resurrected corpses surviving on the fresh blood and organs of others . The deadly dolls each possess a supernatural ability , such as seeing the future . Among the deadly dolls is the spider @-@ controlling Mikaila ( <unk> ) , who is a doll of Suzette ( <unk> , <unk> ) , Augusta 's daughter and Cain 's childhood love . Cain 's half brother and Alexis 's illegitimate son , Jizabel Disraeli ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) works as a doctor for the organization , conducting experiments on humans . Although Alexis physically abused and emotionally traumatized him as well , he refuses to escape from him , and simultaneously despises and envies the bond between Cain and Riff as he believes unconditional love does not exist . His thirty @-@ five @-@ year @-@ old assistant Cassian ( <unk> , <unk> ) , whose body stopped growing due to a rare strain of dwarfism and who was subsequently sold to a circus as a child by his parents , shows concern for Jizabel and his involvement with Alexis and Delilah .

 Having vowed to end Delilah 's experiments with the dead , Cain solves murders while periodically running into Jizabel and other members of Delilah . After encountering Mikaila , who professes her one @-@ sided love for him and wants to become Suzette , he becomes obsessed with destroying the organization and learns that it is secretly building a memorial temple . Meanwhile , despite Jizabel 's efforts to delay Riff 's second , hidden , and cruel personality from awakening , the hypnosis suppressing it breaks . Riff later declares to Cain that he secretly works for Delilah : the loyal , kind @-@ hearted Riff Cain had known is an alternative personality used to deceive others . Alexis had intended for Cain to develop a close bond with Riff , only to break it , to remind Cain that he is unloved . After Riff 's departure , Cain resolves to confront Alexis and promises Mary that they will have a tea party after the conflict with Delilah ends . Led by Cassian , whose brain has been transplanted into an adult body , he reaches the tower within the temple where Alexis plans to sacrifice the brainwashed people of London to revive Augusta . Within the tower , Riff reveals his intent to overthrow Alexis . Unconcerned , Alexis divulges that Riff is Delilah 's longest surviving doll and will soon die . Riff attacks Cain , but Riff 's other personality resurfaces , causing him to deliberately shoot himself . Riff 's loyal personality triumphs over the cruel one , but he and Cain are separated . Because Riff 's wound cannot heal , Jizabel commits suicide so Riff can use his blood to briefly remain alive and return to Cain .

 = = Development = = 
 Manga artist Kaori Yuki chose the Victorian era as the setting for Earl Cain because she liked films from that time period and was inspired by " the darker , <unk> side " of the Victorian upper class . Yuki considered Kafka , a vampire @-@ themed mystery which introduced the secret society led by the protagonist 's father , to be the beginning of the series ' plot . The " pretty risqué theme " of Kafka " embarrassed [ her ] at the time . " After completing the first four parts of Earl Cain , Yuki was uncertain about continuing the series . She wrote her supernatural fantasy manga series Angel Sanctuary ( 1994 – 2000 ) and the chapter " Solomon Grundy 's Sunday " as a " self @-@ introduction " which convinced her to start Godchild . Yuki did historical research for Godchild , traveling to London , England , and visiting seven historical sites : Westminster Abbey , Big Ben , the Tower of London , Windsor Castle , the British Museum , Thames River , and Hyde Park . Because of the gap of several years between the publication of the final The Seal of the Red Ram volume and the first Godchild volume , Yuki included the characters in order of previous appearance with past episodes , and short explanations in the first Godchild volume . Yuki noted that her drawing style differed from her previous series . The darker plot of Godchild worried Yuki , but helped her to decide the series ' ending . Her method of creating suspense in Godchild included adding " lots " of black screentone , " exaggerating " the characters ' expressions , having an elaborate setting , and opening the chapter with an everyday scene to contrast with the " scary scenes " . 
 Yuki believed that the original story was unclear and added extra pages to clarify the twist ending of the series . Because of her decision , the ending chapter of Godchild was eight pages longer than the usual thirty pages for a manga . Yuki was divided between a happy or tragic ending for Cain , noting how readers of Angel Sanctuary had wanted a happy ending for the protagonists . She felt that the ending of Godchild was ambiguous as to whether Cain survived because there is neither blood nor a fatal wound on him . Yuki chose the final line of Godchild from the rhyme " Simple Simon " , joking in the postscript that at least the series did not conclude with the line " And then there were none " . As of finishing the series , Yuki said that she has no plans for additional chapters or side stories . Despite this , she included a five @-@ page epilogue in the 2010 bunkoban release of the entire series . 
 = = = Influences and cultural references = = = 
 Earl Cain contains references to real @-@ life people and literary works . The first Godchild chapter , " Mad Tea Party " , focuses on a mystery with elements from Lewis Carroll 's 1865 novel Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , a work which Yuki has expressed her fondness for . Yuki 's minor character , Victoria , was inspired by Carroll 's character , the Queen of Hearts . Carroll 's 1876 nonsense poem , The Hunting of the Snark , provided Yuki with the name of Jizabel 's childhood pet , Snark . Additionally , the title of the third part of the series , Kafka , refers to the Austrian writer Franz Kafka , and a translation of the first line of his 1915 novella The Metamorphosis appears in the beginning of the volume . Yuki also based the story of Mikaila on the fairytale " Mermaid Princess " . The chapter " Oedipal Blade " takes its name from the Greek character Oedipus Rex , who unknowingly killed his father and married his mother . Yuki also incorporates tales for children and lullabies into the mysteries of the series ; for example , the chapter " Solomon Grundy 's Sunday " uses the nursery rhyme " Solomon Grundy " , while " The Twisted Fairy Tale " refers to the Brothers Grimm fairytale " The Juniper Tree " . References to the bible also appear in the series . The protagonist shares his name with the murderer Cain , and Augusta is compared to Delilah by her father . Additionally , the series alludes to the story of the Kiss of Judas , in which Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus of Nazareth to Roman soldiers by identifying him through a kiss . 
 The influence of films is also seen in Earl Cain . As Yuki enjoys the American television series Twin Peaks ( 1990 – 1991 ) , reviewers have noted its influence on Forgotten Juliet , the first part of Earl Cain . Yuki felt that two minor characters that appear in Forgotten Juliet , <unk> and Leland in the chapter " Branded Bibi " , are reminiscent of the series . Yuki also drew inspiration from the film Young Sherlock Holmes ( 1985 ) for " The Boys Who Stopped Time " , and based the appearance of Cain 's aunt on Charlotte from A Room with a View ( 1985 ) . In the chapter " Double " , one of the characters shares his first name with the actor Emilio Estevez , and director Dario Argento served as the model for the antagonist . While there is no model for Cain , British actor Rupert Graves " left a strong impression " on her with his performance in A Room with a View . Additionally , Riff 's name comes from The Rocky Horror Picture Show ( 1975 ) , which Yuki considers a visual influence along with the films Gothic ( 1986 ) , The Legend of Billie Jean ( 1985 ) , Aliens ( 1986 ) , Lost Boys ( 1987 ) , and Torch @-@ song Trilogy ( 1988 ) . Overall as a manga artist , Yuki has been influenced by Western films and MTV , which she watched in her youth . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Reviewers have focused on a range of themes in Earl Cain . Noting " themes of incest and suicide " in the first four parts of the series , Thompson states that Godchild 's portrayal of incest adheres to " a more classical tormented sense " which results in " guilt , madness , and the punishment of heaven " for the characters . According to Lori Henderson , reviewer and contributor to School Library Journal 's blog Good Comics for Kids , Yuki frequently uses the " power of love " as a theme in her works ; Godchild focuses on " the darker side of love " and its effects on the characters , although she writes that the manga does explore love as a source of empowerment . Henderson also notes the theme of betrayal present in the sixth volume . Writing for IGN , A.E. Sparrow writes that the " issues of beauty , loneliness , jealousy , and family ties " appear in the first volume of Godchild 's mysteries . A French reviewer for Manga News wrote that the theme of " the soiled childhood " occurs throughout the series , depicted by abused children or children 's items , such as dolls , pudding , and puppets , playing a role in some mysteries ; the children 's items appear either in the background as in " The Little Crooked House " or as a major part of the plot as in " Solomon Grundy 's Sunday " .

 The Cain Saga received mixed reviews from critics . Manga Sanctuary awarded the French edition of the first volume five stars , describing it as " excellent . " IGN 's A. E. Sparrow described it as " a wonderful introduction to <unk> manga for the uninitiated " and felt that both The Cain Saga and its sequel Godchild could " appeal to a very broad audience . " The Book Report 's Courtney Kraft praised the " fine attention to detail and aesthetics " of the art and liked the concept of murder mysteries based on children 's rhymes and stories , commenting that Yuki " masters the art of creating a mystery . " 
 Conversely , Mania Entertainment 's Danielle Van Gorder considered the art " still much less refined than her later work in Angel Sanctuary , " and commented on the amount of tragedy in the series . Manga News rated the first volume 15 out of 20 , commenting that the male characters looked similar and had similar facial expressions in contrast to the more recognizable female ones . In Manga : The Complete Guide , Jason Thompson rated the series two and a half stars out of four , stating : " In its best moments , The Cain Saga captures the genuine <unk> of the Victorian era , or at least of its stereotypes . " The Cain Saga was also criticized for scenes with " poorly organized " artwork , one @-@ dimensional characters , predictable mysteries , and confusing plot , caused by the back @-@ story and characters . 
 Conversely , the sequel , Godchild , received positive reviews . When the first chapter premiered in Shojo Beat , critics commented on the <unk> and art of the series , but found the chapter " listless " and confusing . Reviews of the bound volumes were positive . Writing for The Book Report , Robin Brenner described the mysteries as " unsettling , splatter @-@ filled , and deliciously in line with the melodramatic , horrific traditions of Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley . " Leroy Douresseaux of <unk> Cartoons wrote : " By turns bizarre and unsettling , Godchild is actually quite engaging , but can be difficult to follow for those who didn 't come in at the beginning " . Writing for Sequential Tart , Sheena McNeil described Godchild as " a masterpiece in every sense of the word . " In reviews of subsequent volumes , she lowered her score , and praised Yuki 's characterization , mysteries , and artwork ; she concluded : " Godchild is a fantastic and different story that can 't be denied . " 
 Critics praised the art of the series as detailed and distinct , with several noting the difference in the illustrations of The Cain Saga and Godchild . B. D. Gest 's M. Natali wrote that " one senses immediately how the art of Kaori Yuki has evolved and improved since [ The Cain Saga ] " . About.com 's Deb Aoki placed the series on her recommended reading list of horror manga , commenting on the " ravishing " artwork and " lush gothic details . " While describing the series as " the manga equivalent of Twizzlers " and the premise as " <unk> and just plain silly , " Katherine Dacey of <unk> Shock added , " Kaori Yuki 's distinctive artwork and macabre sensibility make this overripe setup entertaining , even if the occasionally slangy dialogue and CSI @-@ style forensics seem implausible in a Victorian London setting . " 
 According to Publishers Weekly , Yuki 's art consists of " startlingly odd angles and abrupt jumps from closeups to distant shots " with which she establishes " a giddy mood " that enables the readers to be sympathetic to the events . Although Yuki 's character designs stuck to " certain shōjo conventions " , they were seen as detailed and " perfect " for the mood of Godchild . Reviewers enjoyed the conclusion to the series , although one wanted a clearer fate for Cain and another commented on the " rushed " ending scenes . Godchild was also criticized for the characters ' cruelty , Jizabel 's disturbing back @-@ story , and limited appeal of the series ' universe .

It was built in 1877 and is 94 feet 2 inches ( 28 @.@ 7 m ) long . The bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 , and had a major restoration in 1998 . The Cogan House bridge is named for the township and village of Cogan House , and is also known by at least four other names : Buckhorn , Larrys Creek , Day 's , and <unk> . 
 The Cogan House Covered Bridge was constructed by a millwright who assembled the timber framework in a field next to the sawmill , before it was reassembled at the bridge site . It was the only bridge on Larrys Creek that survived the flood of June 1889 , and one of only a handful that were left intact in the county . Although the bridge used to carry a steady flow of tannery and sawmill traffic , the clearcutting of the surrounding forests meant the end of those industries by the early 20th century . 
 Since then much of the surrounding area has reverted to second growth forest , and the one @-@ lane bridge is now on a dead end road in a remote valley with little traffic . It is the oldest and longest of the three covered bridges remaining in the county . Despite the 1998 restoration and other repairs , as of 2009 the bridge structure 's sufficiency rating on the National Bridge Inventory was 17 @.@ 2 percent and its condition was deemed " basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action " .

 The covered bridge is 1 @.@ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 3 km ) south of Pennsylvania Route 184 on Campbell Road ( Township Road 784 ) , 0 @.@ 1 miles ( 0 @.@ 2 km ) past the intersection with Covered Bridge Road . Its official name on the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) is " Cogan House Covered Bridge " . It is the only covered bridge ever built in Cogan House Township and the name comes from the township , as well as the village of Cogan House , which is northeast of the bridge . Cogan House Township and the village are named for David Cogan , who settled on Larrys Creek in 1825 . Cogan was one of the few settlers in the area for many years and grew tired of living nearly alone in the wilderness . In 1842 he abandoned his homestead , as did a neighbor named Carter . Their houses were used by hunters and travelers and the name Cogan 's House was given to the area . Cogan House Township was formed from parts of Jackson and Mifflin Townships on December 6 , 1843 . 
 Since the bridge 's 1998 restoration , the Lycoming County Commissioners have officially called it the " Buckhorn Covered Bridge " . The name comes from the bridge 's location at the base of Buckhorn Mountain , and from the road to the former village of Buckhorn , which crossed the creek on it . This is the name used on the official plaque erected by the commissioners to mark its restoration and placement on the NRHP , despite the different name used on the Register itself . The commissioners chose " Buckhorn Covered Bridge " based on one of the names used in Benjamin and June Evans ' 1993 book Pennsylvania 's Covered Bridges : A Complete Guide . Historically , the commissioners used " Cogan House Covered Bridge " as the official name . 
 Historian Milton W. Landis uses " Larrys Creek Covered Bridge " since it crosses Larrys Creek , and notes this was the name used by other local historians . Larrys Creek is named for Larry Burt , who was the first settler at the mouth of the creek when the surveyors came through in 1769 . Landis acknowledges the " Cogan House " name , and says the bridge has also been known by the names of " several tenants who lived in the little farm adjacent " to it . 
 While Landis does not give these different names , two other names for the bridge are known and may come from some of these tenants . The first of these is " Day 's Bridge " and it is clear that this is another name for the Cogan House Covered Bridge . The second of these , " <unk> Bridge " , is a name in a list of existing and vanished covered bridges in Lycoming County . Although the association of this name with the Cogan House Covered Bridge is not made explicitly , it is described as still standing on Larrys Creek and being north of a bridge in Mifflin Township . This is the only known covered bridge that meets those criteria . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The first covered bridge in the United States was built over the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania in 1800 . Some of the first Burr arch truss covered bridges were also built in the state . Pennsylvania is estimated to have once had at least 1 @,@ 500 covered bridges , and is believed to have had the most in the country between 1830 and 1875 . In 2001 Pennsylvania had more surviving historic covered bridges than any other state , with 221 remaining in 40 of the commonwealth 's 67 counties . 
 Covered bridges were a transition between stone and cast @-@ iron and steel bridges . In 19th @-@ century Pennsylvania , lumber was an abundant resource for bridge construction , but did not last long when exposed to weather and the elements . The roof and enclosed sides of covered bridges protected the structural elements , allowing some of these bridges to survive well over a century . A Burr arch truss consists of a load @-@ bearing arch sandwiching multiple King posts , resulting in a bridge which is both stronger and more rigid than one built using either element alone . 
 In 1850 a plank road was built in Lycoming County , from the mouth of Larrys Creek to the borough of Salladasburg , Pennsylvania . It was later extended north along the Second Fork of Larrys Creek as far as the unincorporated villages of Brookside and White Pine in Cogan House Township , and eventually went as far as the large tannery in the village of English Center in Pine Township on Little Pine Creek . Another branch of the plank road followed Larrys Creek itself north from Salladasburg . While its exact length is unknown , Landis reports it may have reached nearly to the site of the covered bridge . 
 Before there was a bridge , there was a ford at the site where the bridge was later built . Wagons of finished leather and raw hides came from and went to the English Center tannery via White Pine , seeking to avoid traffic on the plank road along the Second Fork . Other traffic went to and from a large sawmill at White Pine and other mills to the west and north . Traffic from the north crossed Larrys Creek , and continued either east over Buckhorn Mountain to the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad at the village of Cogan Station on Lycoming Creek , or south down the road along Larrys Creek . This road led to a tannery on Larrys Creek about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of the ford , and to the plank road along the main branch of the creek . The plank road was a toll road and connected with another railroad , the West Branch Division of the Pennsylvania Canal , and the West Branch Susquehanna River at the creek 's mouth . 
 Because the ford was often impassable in winter or bad weather , or during high water , a petition from the citizens of Cogan House Township for a bridge to be built was filed in September 1876 . They asked the county to build the bridge as it was beyond the resources of the township to do so . The petition was read on September 30 , 1876 , and three viewers were appointed on November 3 to examine the site and report back . The viewers reported back in favor of building the bridge on November 25 . On January 23 , 1877 , the county grand jury approved the report and the construction of the bridge . 
 = = = Construction and description = = = 
 Landis is not certain if the bridge was built in 1877 or 1878 , but every other source that mentions the date agrees it was 1877 . Valentine ( " Tine " ) Meyers ( or Meyer ) , a millwright and resident of the hamlet of <unk> in Lycoming Township , built the bridge . The timbers for the bridge were cut at an " up and down " , steam powered sawmill owned by Robert Wood , a short distance north of the bridge site . The head <unk> at the mill was John <unk> . The wood used was pine , cut in nearby forests and hauled in ox carts to the mill . The largest timbers used in the bridge are up to 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) long . 
 Meyers is not believed to have had much experience building bridges and set about construction in a unique manner . The timber framework was first assembled in a field next to the sawmill , with each new piece bolted into place after being cut . If a piece did not fit , more careful measurements were made and a new piece was cut and tested . The outlines of the sections for curved beams for the Burr arch were first marked with chalk on the wood , then the saw crew lifted and guided it by hand against the <unk> to cut the curve . After the framework was completed in the field , it was taken apart , loaded onto the same ox carts used to bring the logs to the mill , and taken to the bridge site . There the framework was reassembled on the bridge abutments . Bolts were used to hold all of the large pieces together , while cross @-@ pieces and small braces were nailed in place . 
 The Cogan House Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP in 1980 and was listed on the 2009 National Bridge Inventory ( NBI ) . According to the NBI , the covered bridge is 94 feet 2 inches ( 28 @.@ 7 m ) long , with a roadway 14 feet 5 inches ( 4 @.@ 4 m ) wide , and a maximum load of 7 @.@ 2 short tons ( 6 @.@ 5 t ) . According to the NRHP , the bridge 's " road surface width " is 19 feet 7 inches ( 6 @.@ 0 m ) , the load is 4 @.@ 0 short tons ( 3 @.@ 6 t ) , and the clearance height is 10 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 2 m ) . The width is only sufficient for a single lane of traffic . As of 2011 , the clearance height posted on the bridge itself has been reduced to 8 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 6 m ) , and the posted maximum load has been reduced to 3 @.@ 0 short tons ( 2 @.@ 7 t ) . According to Landis , the top of the Burr arch is nearly 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) above the floor of the bridge . 
 The covered bridge rests on the original stone abutments , which have since been reinforced with concrete made of cement . The bridge deck is made of crosswise planking , overlaid with runners in the western half and lengthwise planking in the eastern half . The upper part of the portals and the clapboard siding is made of pine boards , and stops 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) below the roof line . Although the bridge was painted red as part of its 1998 restoration , in 1964 it was described as unpainted , and it does not seem to have been painted in 1980 , as the NRHP nomination form describes how " its rough horizontal siding ... help [ s ] this small bridge blend into the surrounding forest " . The roof was originally covered with wooden shingles . The bridge does not have parapets and has " no steel reinforcements " .

 The Cogan House Covered Bridge was the only one on Larrys Creek to survive a major flood on June 1 , 1889 , which washed out most other bridges throughout Lycoming County . A large fallen maple tree formed a dam across Larrys Creek , just upstream of the bridge ; this dam blocked debris and diverted the brunt of the floodwaters . The same flood destroyed the Larrys Creek plank road and the canal at the creek 's mouth . The same storm system also caused the Johnstown Flood , which killed over 2 @,@ 200 people . 
 After the flood the plank road was only reconstructed as far north as Salladasburg , so for a time all the traffic from the English Center tannery went over the bridge on the way to the railroad at Cogan Station . However , the virgin timber which supplied the local tanneries and sawmills was all clear @-@ cut within several years of the flood . Without timber , the industries that used the roads leading to the bridge closed and the local villages declined , or , in the case of Buckhorn , disappeared . 
 By 1900 , there were four remaining covered bridges on Larrys Creek : going upstream they were at the hamlet of Larryville in Piatt Township , at or near Mud Run in Mifflin Township , in Salladasburg , and in Cogan House Township . As of 2011 , the Cogan House Covered Bridge is the oldest and longest of three 19th @-@ century covered bridges remaining in Lycoming County ( the others are the Buttonwood Covered Bridge in Jackson Township over Blockhouse Creek , and the Lairdsville Covered Bridge in Moreland Township over Little Muncy Creek ) . 
 The bridge had " needed repairs " made in 1964 , and the original stone abutments were reinforced with concrete prior to 1966 . It was added to the NRHP on July 24 , 1980 in a Multiple Property Submission of seven Covered Bridges of Bradford , Sullivan and Lycoming Counties , and was " painted and <unk> " in 1981 . The 1980 NRHP form and Zacher 's 1994 book both list the bridge 's condition as good . The Lycoming County Commissioners had the bridge " rehabilitated " in 1998 , at a cost of $ 105 @,@ 493 . The general contractor for the restoration was Lycoming Supply Inc . , which replaced some structural beams with treated southern pine and the " Dutch lap " or clapboard siding with white pine . The purlins and rafters were reconstructed using treated yellow pine , and support a new roof of cedar shake shingles . The deck and floor of the bridge were solid and required few repairs . The bridge was painted red , and a stone pillar was built with plaques marking the restoration and the bridge 's inclusion on the NRHP . 
 Because the bridge is listed on the NRHP , the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission had to approve the renovation . Pennsylvania Department of Transportation ( PennDOT ) and Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) funds helped pay for the work done . The dedication ceremony was held on October 30 , 1998 , with Lycoming County Commissioner Russell Reitz and PennDOT Director of Municipal Services Thomas Lyons cutting a plank on wooden <unk> with an old crosscut saw as the ribbon cutting ceremony . The other county commissioners and the local state representative and state senator were also present and spoke , as did a representative of the " Theodore Burr Covered Bridge Society of Pennsylvania " . 
 In August 2000 an inspection revealed that one of the timber arches of the Cogan House Covered Bridge was damaged by a vehicle which was over the weight limit crossing the bridge . A propane delivery truck making a delivery to the private hunting cabin served by the bridge is thought to have caused the damage . Lycoming Supply Inc. won the bid to do the repair work in December , at a cost of $ 6 @,@ 300 . Before the repair the bridge remained open and was safe to use . The Evans ' 2001 book describes the condition of the bridge as excellent . 
 Despite the restoration and repairs , the 2009 FHWA National Bridge Inventory found the sufficiency rating of the bridge structure to be 17 @.@ 2 percent . The inventory found the condition of the bridge deck and the substructure was satisfactory , while the superstructure was poor . It further found that the bridge 's foundations were " determined to be stable for assessed or calculated scour conditions " , however the railings " do not meet currently acceptable standards " . Its overall condition was deemed " basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action " ; the 2006 NBI estimated the cost to improve the bridge at $ 143 @,@ 000 . 
 The bridge is still used , although the public dirt road to it ends in a cul de sac on the east side . A gated private road continues to the private hunting camp and provides access to Pennsylvania State Game Lands No. 114 . The bridge has a posted speed limit of 10 miles per hour ( 16 km / h ) and its average daily traffic was ten vehicles in 2009 . Pennsylvania 's Covered Bridges : A Complete Guide notes that despite being " located in a rather remote area , it is worth the trip to see this beautifully restored historic treasure . "

 The following table is a comparison of published measurements of length , width and load recorded in five different sources using different methods , as well as the name or names cited . The NBI measures bridge length between the " backwalls of abutments " or pavement grooves and the roadway width as " the most restrictive minimum distance between curbs or rails " . The NRHP form was prepared by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission ( PHMC ) , which surveyed county engineers , historical and covered bridge societies , and others for all the covered bridges in the commonwealth . The Evans visited every covered bridge in Pennsylvania in 2001 and measured each bridge 's length ( portal to portal ) and width ( at the portal ) for their book . The data in Zacher 's book was based on a 1991 survey of all covered bridges in Pennsylvania by the PHMC and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation , aided by local government and private agencies . The article uses primarily the NBI and NRHP data , as they are national programs .

 = Mycena maculata = 
 Mycena maculata , commonly known as the reddish @-@ spotted Mycena , is a species of fungus in the Mycenaceae family . The fruit bodies , or mushrooms , have conic to bell @-@ shaped to convex caps that are initially dark brown but fade to brownish @-@ gray when young , reaching diameters of up to 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) . They are typically wrinkled or somewhat grooved , and have reddish @-@ brown spots in age , or after being cut or bruised . The whitish to pale gray gills also become spotted reddish @-@ brown as they mature . The stem , up to 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) long and covered with whitish hairs at its base , can also develop reddish stains . The mycelium of M. maculata has bioluminescent properties . The saprobic fungus is found in Europe and North America , where it grows in groups or clusters on the rotting wood of both hardwoods and conifers . The edibility of the fungus is unknown . Although the species is known for , and named after its propensity to stain reddish , occasionally these stains do not appear , making it virtually indistinguishable from M. galericulata . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The species was first described scientifically by the German mycologist Petter Karsten in 1890 . The name Mycena maculata was also used by the Australian mycologist John Burton Cleland in 1934 , but that usage was considered illegitimate , and the species he described has since been renamed to Mycena <unk> by Cheryl Grgurinovic and Tom May in 1997 . 
 The specific epithet maculata is derived from the Latin word " spotted " . The mushroom is commonly known as the " reddish @-@ spotted Mycena " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of M. maculata varies in shape from broadly conic to convex initially , soon expanding to bell @-@ shaped or broadly convex at maturity ; when expanded the cap diameter is typically between 2 and 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 and 1 @.@ 6 in ) . It usually has a distinct umbo , which can be abruptly convex in some individuals and very broad and low in others . The cap margin closely approaches the stem when young , but often flares or curves upward with age . The cap surface is smooth , slimy to the touch , often opaque when young but becomes partially translucent so that the outlines of the gills underneath the cap may be seen nearly to the center , before fading . It is often somewhat wrinkled or has the radial gill grooves deepening with age . It is initially dirty blackish @-@ brown or nearly black , becoming paler dirty brown to brownish @-@ gray with age , and usually with reddish @-@ brown spots . The flesh is somewhat thick under the umbo , but becomes abruptly thinner over the area of the margin ( about 0 @.@ 15 mm ) . It is cartilaginous and firm , dark or pale watery gray , changing slowly to dirty reddish @-@ brown when cut or bruised . It has no distinguishable odor , and a taste ranging from mild to slightly farinaceous ( like flour ) . 
 The gills are bluntly adnate , later becoming toothed and somewhat sinuate . The gills are narrow , becoming moderately broad ( 4 – 5 mm ) , whitish to pale gray in color , soon staining with reddish spots . Sometimes the gills separate slightly from the cap , but remain attached to each other to form a collar . The gill spacing is close to subdistant , with about 17 – 24 gills reaching the stem ; there are additionally about three tiers of lamellulae ( short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem ) . The stem is usually 4 – 8 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) long and 2 – 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 2 in ) thick , occasionally much longer , often with a long pseudorhiza ( a cordlike structure resembling a plant root ) 1 – 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) that can root into the substrate . The stem is densely covered with sharp , stiff white hairs on the lower portion , and smooth above . It is sometimes twisted , nearly equal in width throughout , hollow , and cartilaginous . The top portion of the stem is pallid , while the remainder is the same color or paler than the cap . The stem base becomes stained reddish @-@ brown to purplish , or the entire lower portion turns a dirty wine red . The edibility of the mushroom is unknown . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 The spores are ellipsoid , amyloid ( meaning they turn bluish @-@ black to black when stained with Melzer 's reagent ) , and measure 7 – 9 by 4 – 5 μm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells in the hymenium ) are 30 – 35 by 7 – 8 μm , and four @-@ spored . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) are embedded in the hymenium and inconspicuous , measuring 20 – 28 by 6 – 12 μm . They are irregular in form ; some have short rodlike projections on the upper part , others have irregular branched finger @-@ like protuberances , while others have wavy walls and an elongated contorted apex . There are no pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face ) in Mycena maculata . The gill tissue is hyaline or very faintly vinaceous @-@ brown when stained in iodine . The cap tissue has a thin pellicle , and the region directly under it is made of hyphae with only slightly enlarged cells , while the remainder is filamentous , and stains yellowish to slightly vinaceous @-@ brown in iodine . The mycelium of M. maculata is bioluminescent ; this property has not been reported for the fruit bodies . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 In the absence of the characteristic reddish staining ( particularly in young specimens ) , M. maculata is indistinguishable in the field from M. galericulata , which also tends to grow in groups or tufts on wood . Microscopically , the latter species has larger spores , ranging from 8 – 12 by 5 @.@ 5 – 9 μm . Another Mycena that stains reddish is M. <unk> ; it can be distinguished by its slightly larger spores , typically 7 – 9 by 5 – 6 @.@ 5 μm , and the white flecks that develop on the lower part of the stem . It is common in eastern North America , and prefers to grows on decaying hardwood . M. haematopus also grows in clusters on wood , but can be differentiated by its scalloped cap margin , a stem which bleeds a reddish juice when cut or broken , and a preference for growing on hardwoods . M. purpureofusca has a purplish cap , gills with purple edges , and usually grows on pine cones . M. <unk> , a species known from Italy and Switzerland , has more gills that reach the stem ( usually between 30 and 40 ) , smooth hyphae in the cortical layer of the stem , and smooth , <unk> cystidia . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The fruit bodies of M. maculata grow in groups to clumps on the wood and debris of both coniferous and deciduous trees . The fungus is found in North America and Europe ( Germany and Norway ) . The North American distribution ranges north from Quebec , Canada , south to Mexico . Mycena specialist Alexander H. Smith , in his 1947 monograph on the genus , called it " the most abundant Mycena on conifer wood in the Pacific Northwest . " It has also been recorded as a new species in Turkey ( Kahramanmaraş district ) in 2006 . 
 = Solomon , King of Hungary = 
 Solomon , also Salomon ( Hungarian : Salamon ; 1053 – 1087 ) was King of Hungary from 1063 . Being the elder son of Andrew I , he was crowned king in his father 's lifetime in 1057 or 1058 . However , he was forced to flee from Hungary after his uncle , Béla I , dethroned Andrew in 1060 . Assisted by German troops , Solomon returned and was again crowned king in 1063 . On this occasion he married Judith , sister of Henry IV , Holy Roman Emperor . In the following year he reached an agreement with his cousins , the three sons of Béla I. Géza , Ladislaus and Lampert acknowledged Solomon 's rule , but in exchange received one @-@ third of the kingdom as a separate duchy . 
 In the following years , Solomon and his cousins jointly fought against the Czechs , the Cumans and other enemies of the kingdom . Their relationship deteriorated in the early 1070s and Géza rebelled against him . Solomon could only maintain his rule in a small zone along the western frontiers of Hungary after his defeat in the Battle of Mogyoród on 14 March 1074 . He officially abdicated in 1081 , but was arrested for conspiring against Géza 's brother and successor , Ladislaus . 
 Solomon was set free during the canonization process of the first king of Hungary , Stephen I , in 1083 . In an attempt to regain his crown , Solomon allied with the Pechenegs , but King Ladislaus defeated their invading troops . According to a nearly contemporaneous source , Solomon died on a plundering raid in the Byzantine Empire . Later legends say that he survived and died as a saintly hermit in Pula ( Croatia ) . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Solomon was a son of King Andrew I of Hungary and his wife , Anastasia of Kiev . His parents were married in about 1038 . He was born in 1053 as his parents ' second child and eldest son . 
 His father had him crowned king in 1057 or 1058 . Solomon 's coronation was a fundamental condition of his engagement to Judith , a sister of Henry IV , King of Germany . Their engagement put an end to the more than ten @-@ year @-@ long period of armed conflicts between Hungary and the Holy Roman Empire . However , Solomon 's coronation provoked his uncle , Béla , who had until that time held a strong claim to succeed his brother Andrew according to the traditional principle of seniority . Béla had , since around 1048 , administered the so @-@ called ducatus or duchy , which encompassed one @-@ third of the kingdom . 
 According to the The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle , a 14th @-@ century chronicle : 
 Because carnal love and ties of blood are wont to prove a hindrance to truthfulness , in King Andreas love for his son overcame justice , so that he broke the treaty of his promise , which in kings should not be ; in the twelfth year of his reign , when he was worn out with age , he caused his son Salomon , who was still a child of five years , to be anointed and crowned king over all Hungary . He pretended that he did this to prevent injury to his kingdom , for the Emperor would not have given his daughter to his son Salomon unless he had crowned him . When therefore they sang at Salomon 's coronation : " Be lord over thy brethren , " and it was told to Duke Bela by an interpreter that the infant Salomon had been made king over him , he was greatly angered . 
 According to the Illuminated Chronicle , in order to secure Solomon 's succession , his father arranged a meeting with Duke Béla at the royal manor in Tiszavárkony . The king proposed that his brother choose between a crown and a sword ( which were the symbols of royal and ducal power , respectively ) , but had previously commanded his men to murder the duke if Béla picked the crown . 
 The duke , whom a courtier had informed of the king 's plan , chose the crown , then left Hungary after the meeting . He sought the assistance of Duke Boleslaus the Bold of Poland and returned with Polish reinforcements . Béla emerged the victor in the ensuing civil war , during which Solomon 's father was mortally injured in a battle . Solomon and his mother fled to the Holy Roman Empire and settled in Melk in Austria . 
 Béla was crowned king on 6 December 1060 , but the young German king 's advisors , who were staunch supporters of Solomon ( the fiancé of their monarch 's sister ) , refused to conclude a peace treaty with him . In the summer of 1063 , the assembly of the German princes decided to invade Hungary in order to restore Solomon . Solomon 's uncle died in an accident on 11 September , before the imperial army arrived . His three sons — Géza , Ladislaus and Lampert — left for Poland . 
 = = Reign = = 
 Accompanied back to Hungary by German troops , Solomon entered Székesfehérvár without resistance . He was ceremoniously " crowned king with the consent and acclamation of all Hungary " in September 1063 , according to the Illuminated Chronicle . The same source adds that the German monarch " seated " Solomon " upon his father 's throne " , but did not require him to take an oath of fealty . Solomon 's marriage with Henry IV 's sister , Judith — who was six years older than her future husband — also took place on this occasion . Judith , along with her mother @-@ in @-@ law Anastasia , became one of her young husband 's principal advisors . 
 Solomon 's three cousins - Géza and his brothers - returned after the German troops had been withdrawn from Hungary . They arrived with Polish reinforcements and Solomon sought refuge in the fortress of Moson at the western border of his kingdom . The Hungarian prelates began to mediate between them in order to avoid a new civil war . 
 Solomon and his cousins eventually reached an agreement , which was signed in Győr on 20 January 1064 . Géza and his brothers acknowledged Solomon as lawful king , and Solomon granted them their father 's one @-@ time ducatus . In token of their reconciliation , Duke Géza put a crown on Solomon 's head in the cathedral of Pécs on Easter Sunday . Their relationship remained tense ; when the cathedral burned down during the following night , they initially accused each other of arson . The episode is described in the Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle as follows : 
 [ Sudden ] flames seized that church and the palaces and all nearby buildings , and they collapsed in one devastating conflagration . Everyone was gripped with fear at the shock of the roaring flames and the terrible shattering of the bells as they fell from the towers ; and none knew where to turn . The King and the Duke were in an amazed stupor ; terrified by the suspicion of foul work , each went his separate way . In the morning they were apprised through faithful messengers that in truth there had not been on either side any evil intention of treachery , but that the fire had been happening of chance . The King and the Duke came together again in the goodness of peace . 
 The king and his cousins closely cooperated in the period between 1064 and 1071 . Both Solomon and Géza were , in 1065 or 1066 , present at the consecration of the Benedictine <unk> Abbey , established by Palatine Otto of the Győr clan , a partisan of the king . They invaded Bohemia together after the Czechs had plundered the region of Trencsén ( present @-@ day Trenčín , Slovakia ) in 1067 . During the following year , nomadic tribes broke into Transylvania and plundered the regions , but Solomon and his cousins routed them at Kerlés ( present @-@ day <unk> , Romania ) . The identification of the marauders is uncertain : the Annales Posonienses and Simon of Kéza write of Pechenegs , the 14th @-@ century Hungarian chronicles refer to Cumans , and a Russian chronicle mentions the Cumans and the Vlachs . 
 Pecheneg troops pillaged Syrmia ( now in Serbia ) in 1071 . As the king and the duke suspected that the soldiers of the Byzantine garrison at Belgrade incited the marauders against Hungary , they decided to attack the fortress . The Hungarian army crossed the river Sava , although the Byzantines " blew sulphurous fires by means of machines " against their boats . The Hungarians took Belgrade after a siege of three months . However , the Byzantine commander , Niketas , surrendered the fortress to Duke Géza instead of the king ; he knew that Solomon " was a hard man and that in all things he listened to the vile counsels of Count Vid , who was detestable in the eyes both of God and men " , according to the Illuminated Chronicle . 
 Division of the war @-@ booty caused a new conflict between Solomon and his cousin , because the king granted only a quarter of the booty to the duke , who claimed its third part . Thereafter the duke negotiated with the Byzantine Emperor 's envoys and set all the Byzantine captives free without the king 's consent . The conflict was further sharpened by Count Vid ; the Illuminated Chronicle narrates how the count incited the young monarch against his cousins by saying that as " two sharp swords cannot be kept in the same scabbard " , so the king and the duke " cannot reign together in the same kingdom " . 
 The Byzantines reoccupied Belgrade in the next year . Solomon decided to invade the Byzantine Empire and ordered his cousins to accompany him . Only Géza joined the king ; his brother , Ladislaus , remained with half of their troops in the Nyírség . Solomon and Géza marched along the valley of the river Great Morava as far as Niš . Here the locals made them " rich gifts of gold and silver and precious cloaks " and Solomon seized the arm of Saint Procopius of Scythopolis . He donated the relic to the Orthodox monastery of <unk> ( present @-@ day Sremska Mitrovica , Serbia ) . 
 After their return from the campaign , both Solomon and Géza began to make preparations for their inevitable conflict and were seeking assistance from abroad . They concluded a truce , which was to last " from the feast of St Martin until the feast of St George " , from 11 November 1073 until 24 April 1074 . However , Solomon chose to attack his cousin as soon as the German troops sent by his brother @-@ in @-@ law arrived in Hungary . The royal army crossed the river Tisza and routed the troops of Géza , who had been abandoned by many of his nobles before the battle , at Kemej on 26 February 1074 . 
 A strong army soon arrived in Hungary , headed by Géza 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Duke Otto I of Olomouc . In the decisive battle , which was fought at Mogyoród on 14 March 1074 , Solomon was defeated and forced to flee from the battlefield . 
 = = Abdication = = 
 After the battle of Mogyoród , Duke Géza 's soldiers pursued Solomon and his men " from dawn to dusk " , but they managed to take refugee in Moson , where his mother and wife had been staying . According to the Illuminated Chronicle , the queen mother blamed her son for the defeat , which filled Solomon with so much anger that he wanted to " strike his mother in the face " . His wife held him back by catching his hand . 
 Thereafter , Solomon preserved only Moson and the nearby Pressburg ( Bratislava , Slovakia ) . Other parts of the kingdom accepted the rule of Géza , who had been proclaimed king after his victory . 
 Solomon sent his envoys to Henry IV and promised " six of the strongest fortified cities in Hungary " if his brother @-@ in @-@ law would help him to depose Géza . He was even ready to accept the German monarch 's suzerainty . 
 Henry IV invaded Hungary in August . He marched as far as Vác , but soon withdrew from Hungary without defeating Géza . Nevertheless , the German invasion strengthened Solomon 's rule in the region of his two fortresses , where he continued to exercise all royal prerogatives , including coinage . His mother and wife left him and followed Henry IV to Germany . According to Berthold of Reichenau 's Chronicle : 
 That summer [ Henry IV ] undertook an expedition into Hungary to help King Salomon , who also because of his insolent and shameful crimes had been deposed from his office by his father 's brother ( sic ) and the other magnates of the kingdom , for whose counsels he cared little . [ Henry IV ] , however , was able to achieve nothing of what he wished there , namely to restore Salomon . Finally , bringing back his sister , Queen Judith , the wife of Salomon , he returned home to Worms 
 Solomon attempted to convince Pope Gregory VII to support him against Géza . However , the pope condemned him for having accepted his kingdom " as a fief from the king of the Germans " and claimed suzerainty over Hungary . Thereafter it was Henry IV 's support which enabled Solomon to resist Géza 's all attempts at taking Moson and Pressburg . The German monarch even sent one of his main opponents , Bishop Burchard II of Halberstadt into exile to Solomon in June 1076 . Solomon 's wife , Queen Judith , who was about to return to her husband , undertook to take the imprisoned bishop to Hungary , but the prelate managed to escape . 
 Géza decided to start new negotiations with Solomon . However , he died on 25 April 1077 and his partisans proclaimed his brother , Ladislaus , king . The new king occupied Moson in 1079 , thus Solomon could preserve only Pressburg . In 1080 or 1081 , the two cousins concluded a treaty , according to which Solomon acknowledged Ladislaus as king in exchange for " revenues sufficient to bear the expenses of a king " . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Solomon did not give up his ambitions even after his abdication . He was arrested for plotting against his cousin , then held in captivity in Visegrád . He was released " on the occasion of the canonization of King St. Stephen and the blessed Emeric the confessor " around 17 August 1083 . According to Hartvik 's Legend of King Saint Stephen , King Ladislaus ordered Solomon 's release , because nobody could open the grave of the saintly king until Solomon was held in captivity . 
 Having been liberated , Solomon first visited his wife in Regensburg , " although she was not grateful for this " , according to the nearly contemporaneous Bernold of St Blasien . From Germany , Solomon fled to the " Cumans " — in fact Pechenegs , according to the historians Gyula Kristó and Pál Engel — who were dwelling in the regions east of the Carpathian Mountains and north of the Lower Danube . Solomon promised one of their chiefs , Kutesk , that " he would give him the right of possession over the province of Transylvania and would take his daughter as wife " if Kutesk and his people would help him to regain his throne . They invaded the regions along the Upper Tisza " with a great multitude " of the " Cumans " , but King Ladislaus routed and forced them to withdraw from Hungary . 
 At the head of " a large contingent of Dacians " ( Hungarians ) , Solomon joined a huge army of Cumans and Pechenegs who invaded the Byzantine Empire in 1087 . The Byzantines routed the invaders in the mountains of Bulgaria . Solomon seems to have died fighting in the battlefield , because Bernold of St. Blasien narrates that he " died courageously after an incredible slaughter of the enemy after he bravely undertook an enterprise against the King of the Greeks " in 1087 . 
 Reports of later sources prove that Solomon became the subject of popular legends . For instance , the Illuminated Chronicle writes that Solomon " repented of his sins , so far as human understanding may reach " after the battle , and passed the last years of his life " in pilgrimage and prayer , in <unk> and watchings , in labour and contrition " . According to these sources , Solomon died in Pula on the Istrian Peninsula where he was venerated as a saint . However , he was never officially canonized . His alleged tombstone is now in a local museum . Simon of Kéza wrote in his Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum : 
 [ Solomon ] was now completely at a loss , and after returning to his queen at Admont he spent a few days with her before returning to Székesfehérvár in monk 's habit . There , the story goes , his brother ( sic ) Ladislas was distributing alms to the poor with his own hands on the porch of the church of the Blessed Virgin , and Solomon was among the recipients . When Ladislas looked closely he realised who it was . After the distribution was over Ladislas made careful inquiries . He intended Solomon no harm , but Solomon assumed he did , and quit Székesfehérvár , making for the Adriatic . There he passed the rest of his days in complete poverty in a city named Pula ; he died in destitution and was buried there , never having returned to his wife . 
 = = Family = = 
 Solomon 's wife , Judith , who was born in 1048 , was the third daughter of Henry III , Holy Roman Emperor and his second wife , Agnes de Poitou . Their wedding took place in Székesfehérvár in June 1063 . The marriage remained childless . They first separated from each other around 1075 . According to Bernold of St Blasien , neither Solomon nor his wife had " kept the marriage contract : on the contrary , they had not been afraid , in opposition to the apostle , to defraud each other . " Having been informed on Solomon 's death , Judith married Duke Władysław I Herman of Poland in 1088 . In contrast with all contemporaneous sources , the late 13th @-@ century Simon of Kéza writes that Judith " spurned all suitors " after her husband 's death , although " many princes in Germany sought her hand " .

 = Diorama ( Silverchair album ) = 
 Diorama is the fourth studio album by Australian alternative rock band by Silverchair . Released on 31 March 2002 by Atlantic / Eleven . It won the 2002 ARIA Music Award for Best Rock Album . The album was co @-@ produced by Daniel Johns and David Bottrill . While Bottrill had worked on albums for a variety of other bands , Diorama marked the first production credit for lead singer Johns . 
 Johns wrote most of the album at the piano instead of his usual guitar , while the band took a 12 @-@ month break following their previous studio album , Neon Ballroom . Silverchair worked with composer Van Dyke Parks on Diorama ; the album contains numerous orchestral arrangements and power ballads , a change from the post @-@ grunge music typical of their earlier work , but consistent with the band 's previous orchestrations on Neon Ballroom . The album 's title refers to " a world within a world " . Five singles were released : " The Greatest View " , " Without You " , " Luv Your Life " , " Across the Night " and " After All These Years " . All except " After All These Years " , a promotional single , appeared on the Australian singles chart . 
 Diorama was successful in the charts but was not as well received by critics as the band 's earlier albums . It reached number one on the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) Albums Chart and received a rating of 71 ( out of 100 ) on review aggregator Metacritic . It was certified triple @-@ platinum by ARIA , selling in excess of 210 @,@ 000 copies , and won five ARIA Awards in 2002 . Diorama was nominated for Highest Selling Album in 2003 , and three songs from the album were nominated for awards over the two years . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 On Diorama , Silverchair worked with a new producer , David Bottrill , who replaced Nick Launay . Though Launay had produced the band 's three previous albums , lead singer Daniel Johns decided that he needed someone " who understood where he wanted to go " . Johns believed Diorama would be " the kind of record that people were either going to be into or were really going to hate " , and needed a producer who would understand the band 's new direction . He interviewed several candidates , eventually choosing Bottrill and taking the role of co @-@ producer himself . 
 Johns initially recorded eight songs , only to delete the files thinking they were too similar to tracks on the previous album , Neon Ballroom . Leaving the security and darkness of his earlier work , he restarted from scratch to create something more uplifting . Diorama represented a radical change in Silverchair 's musical structure ; the heavy grunge influence on their prior work was replaced by string and horn ensembles and highly complex song structures . Johns felt more comfortable in making this radical change rather than a minor one , finding it helped him to regain his passion for music , which had diminished during the grunge days . Johns wrote much of the album at a baby grand piano ; he had previously taught himself the instrument and composed songs on it for the first time with Diorama . This change in songwriting technique had a significant effect on the sound of the album ; Johns commented on the difference in how his vocals resonated with piano as compared to guitar . He worked with others in developing the album ; Van Dyke Parks ( Beach Boys , U2 ) collaborated on orchestral arrangements , and the pair spent much of their recording time attempting to describe the music in metaphorical terms , with Johns describing Parks ' orchestral swells as " tidal waves " and violins as " a flock of birds " . The pair described the collaborative experience as " mind @-@ blowing " . A DVD entitled Across The Night : The Creation Of Diorama was released in 2002 , featuring interviews with Johns and Parks . 
 Several songs on Diorama were inspired by Johns ' then @-@ girlfriend Natalie Imbruglia , but he cautioned against possible misinterpretations of the songs , stating " Everyone will think that any lyric that 's about someone in a positive light will be about her " and noting that there were other people he cared for about whom he wrote the songs . Johns denied rumours that he had written songs intending Imbruglia to sing them . 
 Silverchair intended to tour supporting Diorama following its release , but plans were postponed when Johns developed reactive arthritis ; causing his joints to swell and making guitar playing and singing too painful . After performing " The Greatest View " at the 2002 ARIA Awards , Johns said that he wanted " to perform [ Diorama 's ] 11 songs at least once in front of an audience " before laying the album to rest . He travelled to California to receive treatments for his arthritis , including daily physiotherapy .

 Following a 31 March 2002 release on record label Eleven , Diorama reached number one on the ARIA Albums Chart on 14 April , making it Silverchair 's fourth chart @-@ topping album . It went on to be certified triple @-@ platinum by ARIA , indicating sales in excess of 210 @,@ 000 copies . The album peaked at number seven in New Zealand , thirteen in Austria , forty in Switzerland , and 116 in France . Diorama reached number ninety @-@ one on the U.S. Billboard 200 . 
 The first single , " The Greatest View " , was released in advance of the album on 28 January 2002 . It reached number three in Australia , where it was also certified gold , and number four in New Zealand and Canada . It charted at number thirty @-@ six on Billboard 's Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 2007 when re @-@ released alongside the band 's next album , Young Modern . Johns wrote " The Greatest View " as a response to the media " always watching [ him ] in different way " . It was not intended to be aggressive , rather a straightforward commentary on the media frenzy that had surrounded the band for many years . 
 On 13 May 2002 , " Without You " was released as the second single . It peaked at number eight in Australia , but dropped to number twenty @-@ nine the following week , only spending five weeks on the chart . The song was first announced by Silverchair bass guitarist Chris Joannou in November 1999 , when he told fans the band had " a very small cache of recorded material stored away " , including " Without You " . " Without You " was followed by " Luv Your Life " , which peaked at number twenty in Australia after its 20 September release . The inspiration for the song came to Johns during a therapy session , based on the idea that " there were people in the world who needed treatment but couldn 't afford therapy . " Johns composed most of the song 's lyrics while listening to a therapist . In a performance at London 's Shepherds Bush Empire , Johns jokingly said " Luv Your Life " was dedicated " to all my ladies " . 
 " After All These Years " , a promotional single , followed " Luv Your Life " , but failed to reach the charts . The final single " Across the Night " was released on 11 March 2003 . The song , which Johns wrote over nine hours on a sleepless night , peaked at number twenty @-@ four on its three weeks on the Australian chart . The arrangement by Parks features twin keyboards and a string ensemble . The band 's much @-@ delayed tour in support of Diorama took its name from " Across the Night " .

 Diorama received a score of 71 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic , based on nine reviews . Australian radio station Triple J listeners voted the album number one on their Top 10 Albums of 2002 , while Triple J staff Rosie Beaton and Gaby Brown placed it third and fifth respectively . 
 Music magazine Rolling Stone gave Diorama four and a half stars in Australia and three out of five stars in the US . Reviewer Mark Kemp praised Silverchair 's development , saying that the band had developed a strong , independent musical ability , in contrast to their heavily influenced debut album , Frogstomp . Kemp spoke highly of the " heavy orchestration , unpredictable melodic shifts and a whimsical pop sensibility " , also noting Parks ' arrangements gave the music " more breadth and depth " . He argued that the album 's strength was a product of Johns ' confidence , resulting in high quality on " World Upon Your Shoulders " , " Tuna in the Brine " , and " After All These Years " . However , " Without You " saw Silverchair slip into " old habits " , according to Kemp , and contained an " MTV @-@ approved hook " . 
 Bradley Torreano , of review website Allmusic , gave Diorama four stars , labeling it an AMG Album Pick . He began by noting that Silverchair 's improvement from the Frogstomp era was impressive , and that Diorama saw the band " finally growing into their own skin . " Bottrill 's production was praised , and the result likened to Big Country and U2 , while Johns showcased " his rich voice and shockingly catchy tunes with a gusto missing from their earlier albums " . Torreano 's criticism was reserved for two songs on the album ; he described the apparent Goo @-@ Goo Dolls influences on " Without You " as " an unwelcome twist " , and felt that on " One Way Mule " , the band reverted " back to their grunge sound " . 
 James Jam , of music magazine NME , was critical of Diorama , calling it " over @-@ produced Aussie rock " . Jam compared Silverchair to Bryan Adams in their attempt to " venture boldly into exciting new musical landscapes " . " Tuna in the Brine " was " grossly pretentious and overblown " , while he saw the album as a whole as inoffensive , especially in comparison to the band 's past post @-@ grunge . According to Jam , the band were not trying to make a mature musical statement with the album , but rather to " impress their parents " . 
 Nikki Tranter of pop @-@ music website PopMatters called the album mature , praising everything from the cover art to the " finely crafted pop melodies " . Tranter praised Diorama for standing out in the " very similar " Australian music scene . The majority of songs on the album were rated highly ; she thought " The Greatest View " was a stand @-@ out with " orchestral twangs " , and " After All These Years " had " sweeping horns , introspective lyrics and soft , haunting vocals " . 
 Rob O 'Connor of Yahoo ! ' s music website gave Diorama a positive review , agreeing that the band had matured greatly since their early high school releases . The pop songs on the album , " Luv Your Life " and " Too Much Of Not Enough " , were said to " glide " , and O 'Connor praised Johns for " whisper [ ing ] his lyrics with grace and subtlety " where in the past he would " shout in angst " , drawing comparisons to Elliott Smith . His main critique of the album was that it still contained some " obligatory ' grunge ' efforts " ; he felt eliminating those would allow the band to reach its full potential .

 = Ethical Oil : The Case for Canada 's Oil Sands = 
 Ethical Oil : The Case for Canada 's Oil Sands is a book written by Canadian lawyer , talk @-@ show host and lobbyist Ezra Levant , which makes a case for exploiting the Athabasca oil sands and its sister projects in Alberta . Published in 2010 by McClelland & Stewart in Toronto , Canada , the book became a non @-@ fiction best seller and won the National Business Book Award for 2011 . 
 In the 261 page book , Ezra Levant makes the case that in terms of four criteria ( the environment , conflict , economic and social justice and freedom from oppression ) the Canadian petroleum industry is " heads above other crude producers like Saudi Arabia , Libya , Nigeria and Venezuela " . Highlighting perceived hypocrisy from Western progressive and environmental movements , the author confronts what he sees as unfair and excessive criticism of oil sands , stating that the " oil sands are not perfect , and criticizing them is fair game . But why has criticism of the oil sands been so disproportionately loud compared to criticism of other , larger , more disturbing sources of oil ? " . 
 Ethical Oil : The Case for Canada 's Oil Sands has popularized the concept of " ethical oil " as a neologism , giving ammunition to the Conservative government of Stephen Harper and providing the inspiration behind <unk> Velshi 's " <unk> " campaign in the United States and Canada . 
 = = Background = = 
 Oil sands in Alberta have a proven reserve of 170 billion barrels ( 2 @.@ 7 × 1010 m3 ) , the second largest proven reserves of crude oil in the world . They have become the largest source of oil imported into the United States . With significant economic development and investment into the oil sands , the industry has been enjoying strong support by both the province 's government and the federal government . However , the industry has also been subject to criticism due to the environmental impacts of bitumen exploitation . While the industry has attempted to resolve these issues by developing new techniques , such as in situ extraction , environmental organizations , such as Greenpeace , have launched campaigns to delegitimize the resource , based on its greenhouse gas emission records . 
 Canada 's primary export market , the United States , has been ambivalent to the environmental questions surrounding the exploitation of the oil sands , with Republicans being generally more supportive of the resource , while president Barack Obama , a Democrat , said that " there are some environmental questions about how destructive they are " . 
 In an attempt to refocus the debate , Ezra Levant , a conservative political activist , former publisher of the Western Standard and the host of The Source on Sun News Network , examines the ethical aspects of importing oil from countries where political oppression and human rights violations are prevalent , and argues that oil sands production from Canada should be considered the only true ethical alternative to OPEC oil exports . His inspiration for the concept of ' ethical oil ' came from the neologism ' conflict diamond ' , and its <unk> ' conflict @-@ free diamond ' . Levant decided to write the book to change some minds , after realizing at the 2009 Ottawa International Writers Festival in Ottawa that he was the " token Alberta whipping boy " during a panel on the oil sands , and ineffective at convincing the audience of the merits of the oil sands . Ezra Levant stated that he wrote the book from a liberal point of view , in order to appeal to those who reject the traditional conservative point of view . 
 = = Content = = 
 The book is divided into 12 chapters , with a prologue , an epilogue , acknowledgments and sources . Chapters deal with various topics , including an overview of the biggest oil producing countries , an account of the controversy over Talisman Energy 's involvement in Sudan , a critical analysis of some ethical funds , a case about inconsistencies in Greenpeace activism , a rebuke of the cancer controversy in Fort Chipewyan , the implication of Middle @-@ Eastern regimes in the anti @-@ Oil sands movement , and a critical analysis of the green jobs arguments . 
 A recurring theme throughout Ethical Oil : The Case for Canada 's Oil Sands is the perceived hypocrisy of Western environmental movements . In a chapter entitled " Greenpeace 's Best Fundraiser Ever " , Levant notes the disparities between the harsh criticism of the Canadian energy industry coming from Greenpeace Canada to the seemingly absent criticism of Chinese industrial activity ( such as nuclear power ) from Greenpeace China , arguing that it is much easier to criticize free and liberal democracies than to criticize controlling regimes , but also raising the question of funding , noting that China , the most populated country on Earth , is a very attractive fundraising market for Greenpeace ( which Levant describes as a ' multinational corporation ' ) . 
 = = Reviews = = 
 Andrew Brannan reviewed the book in the The Objective Standard , and noted that it provides a " barrage of evidence in moral defense of the oil sands producers " , while Peter Foster , a Financial Post columnist , suggested that Levant " not only exposes the lies and hypocrisy of the media @-@ coddled opponents of the vast resource , but raises the uncomfortable question of what alternatives to the oilsands these moralists prefer " . On the other hand , David Suzuki , dismissing Levant as an " apologist " , argued that " the logic is faulty . Just because a country or society is considered ' ethical ' does not mean everything it produces or exports is ethical " . In the Winnipeg Free Press , John Collins , a retired union negotiator , criticized some of Levant 's sources , noting the presence of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers in the footnotes , while Patrick <unk> , an editor for The Globe and Mail writing in the Literary Review of Canada , contends that the title of Levant ’ s book " is a considerable misstatement " and that Levant " fails to make the case for ethical oil " .

 = = = Support = = = 
 Ezra Levant 's work gave ammunition to the Conservative government , which adopted the neologism in a similar rhetoric . Stephen Harper , Prime Minister of Canada from 2006 until 2015 , was quoted as saying that it is " critical to develop that resource in a way that ’ s responsible and environmental and the reality for the United States , which is the biggest consumer of our petroleum products , is that Canada is a very ethical society and a safe source for the United States in comparison to other sources of energy . " Danielle Smith , leader of Alberta 's Wildrose Alliance , echoed Levant 's arguments during a speech at the Fort McMurray Chamber of Commerce . 
 In 2011 , <unk> Velshi , a former staffer for Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney left government service and founded a website to promote the ideas put forward by Ezra Levant in his book . He subsequently returned as the Director of Planning for the Prime Minister ’ s Office later in 2011 . The website , <unk> launched a campaign to compare Canada 's ' Ethical Oil ' against OPEC 's ' Conflict Oil ' and features controversial advertisements comparing conditions for women , gays and other minorities in OPEC countries to those in Canada . <unk> has staged counter @-@ protests in response to opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline project . Velshi left Ethical Oil in the fall of 2011 , and was replaced by law student and former junior Conservative staffer Kathryn Marshall .

 Among critics of the ' Ethical Oil ' point of view is Andrew <unk> , author of Tar Sands : Dirty Oil and the Future of a Continent ( Greystone Books , 2008 , ISBN 1 @-@ <unk> @-@ 407 @-@ 2 ) , who referred to Levant 's reasoning as " a classic Republican ruse " , and dismissed Minister of the Environment Peter Kent 's argument as an " infomercial on bitumen " . In The Guardian , Leo Hickman points out that China is a major investor in the Canadian oil sands , and asks " Shouldn 't this now mean that Canada 's tar sands are labelled as ' Conflict Oil ' , too ? " Another opponent , Megan Leslie , the environment critic for the Official Opposition 's New Democratic Party , said the debate surrounding the ethics of Canadian oil sands " misses the point " and maintained that " Canada should be working to move beyond fossil fuels toward renewable sources of energy " . 
 CBC 's The Current held a debate on the merits of the ethical oil argument in Dec 2011 . Nobel laureate and chair of the Nobel Women 's Initiative Jody Williams , argued that the ethical oil position was disingenuous and suspect of commercial interests rather than genuine concern for women ’ s rights . She argued that the oil industry with no history of advocating the case of women ’ s rights , is ill placed to begin the discussion . Ethical Oil spokesperson Kathryn Marshall responded that the ethical nature of oil production needs to be discussed , and she expected human rights activists to be more inclined to promote dialogue . Dr. Andrew Crane a business ethics professor at York University agreed the ethical argument for oil production should be discussed , but also added the narrow focus of the books argument was prioritising human rights over other ethical evaluating factors . Dr. Crane further stated that Canada was not taking a leadership position by trying to improve ethical extraction practices overseas and not just in Canada . He argued a primary ethical indicator is leadership , and companies operating in Canada , and Canadian companies operating abroad were not being held accountable within the ethical oil argument for their overseas practices . Kathryn Marshall responded the focus should be on the pushing these " unethical " countries for regulatory action , rather than the pushing the companies to improve in the absence of a regulatory impetus .

 The PlayStation 4 ( abbreviated as PS4 ) is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment , formerly Sony Computer Entertainment . Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 during a press conference on February 20 , 2013 , it was launched on November 15 , 2013 in North America , and November 29 , 2013 in Europe , South America and Australia , and February 22 , 2014 in Japan . It competes with Nintendo 's Wii U and Microsoft 's Xbox One , as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles . 
 Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor , the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit ( APU ) built upon the x86 @-@ 64 architecture , which has a theoretical peak performance of 1 @.@ 84 <unk> ; AMD stated that it was the " most powerful " APU they had developed to date . The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services , including the ability to play games off @-@ console on PlayStation Vita and supported Sony Xperia mobile devices ( " Remote Play " ) , the ability to stream gameplay online , or to friends with them controlling gameplay remotely ( " Share Play " ) . The console 's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3 , with improved buttons and analog sticks , and an integrated touchpad among other changes . 
 Reception to the PlayStation 4 prior to its launch was positive , with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers ' needs , embrace of independent game development , and for not imposing the same digital rights management schemes that Microsoft had previously announced for Xbox One prior to its release . Critics and third @-@ party studios also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors ; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as being " significant " and " obvious " . Heightened demand for the PS4 helped Sony top global console sales . As of May 22 , 2016 , more than 40 million consoles have been sold worldwide . 
 = = History = = 
 According to lead architect Mark Cerny , development of Sony 's fourth video game console began as early as 2008 . Less than two years earlier , the PlayStation 3 had launched after months of delays due to issues with production . The delay placed Sony almost a year behind Microsoft 's Xbox 360 , which was already approaching unit sales of 10 million by the time the PS3 launched . PlayStation Europe CEO Jim Ryan said Sony wanted to avoid repeating the same mistake with PS3 's successor . 
 In designing the system , Sony worked with software developer Bungie , who offered their input on the controller and how to make it better for shooting games . In 2012 , Sony began shipping development kits to game developers , consisting of a modified PC running the AMD Accelerated Processing Unit chipset . These development kits were known as " Orbis " . 
 In early 2013 , Sony announced that an event known as PlayStation Meeting 2013 would be held in New York City , U.S. , on February 20 , 2013 , to cover the " future of PlayStation " . Sony officially announced the PlayStation 4 at the event . They revealed details about the console 's hardware and discussed some of the new features it will introduce . Sony also showed off real @-@ time footage of games in development , as well as some technical demonstrations . The design of the console was unveiled in June 2013 at the Electronic Entertainment Expo , and the initial recommended retail prices of $ 399 ( NA ) , € 399 ( Europe ) , and £ 349 ( UK ) given . 
 The company revealed release dates for North America , Central America , South America , Europe and Australia , as well as final pieces of information , at a Gamescom press event in Cologne , Germany , on August 20 , 2013 . The console was released on November 15 , 2013 in the United States and Canada , followed by further releases on November 29 , 2013 . By the end of 2013 , the PS4 was launched in more European , Asian and South American countries The PS4 released in Japan at ¥ 39 @,@ 980 on February 22 , 2014 . 
 Sony finalized a deal with the Chinese government in May 2014 to sell its products in mainland China , and the PS4 will be the first product to be released . Kazuo Hirai , chief executive officer of Sony , said in May : " The Chinese market , just given the size of it , is obviously potentially a very large market for video game products ... I think that we will be able to replicate the kind of success we have had with PS4 in other parts of the world in China . " 
 In September 2015 , Sony reduced the price of the PS4 in Japan to ¥ 34 @,@ 980 , with similar price drops in other Southeast Asian markets . The first official sub £ 300 PS4 bundle was the £ 299 @.@ 99 ' Uncharted Nathan Drake Collection <unk> ' , released in the UK on October 9 , 2015 ; a <unk> £ 329 @.@ 99 version was offered at the same time . On October 9 , 2015 , the first official price cut of the PS4 in North America was announced : a reduction of $ 50 to $ 349 @.@ 99 ( US ) and by $ 20 to $ 429 @.@ 99 ( Canada ) . An official price cut in Europe followed in late October 2015 , reduced to € 349 @.@ 99 / £ 299 @.@ 99 . 
 On June 10 , 2016 , Sony confirmed that a hardware revision of PlayStation 4 , rumored to be codenamed " Neo " , was under development . The new revision is a higher @-@ end model that is meant to support gameplay in 4K .

 Pre @-@ release reception to the console from developers and journalists was positive . Mark Rein of Epic Games praised the " enhanced " architecture of Sony 's system , describing it as " a phenomenal piece of hardware " . John Carmack , programmer and co @-@ founder of id Software , also commended the design by saying " Sony made wise engineering choices " , while Randy Pitchford of Gearbox Software expressed satisfaction with the amount of high @-@ speed memory in the console . Eurogamer also called the graphics technology in the PS4 " impressive " and an improvement from the difficulties developers experienced on the PlayStation 3 . 
 Numerous industry professionals have acknowledged the PlayStation 4 's performance advantage over the Xbox One . Speaking to Edge magazine , multiple game developers have described the difference as " significant " and " obvious " . ExtremeTech says the PS4 's graphics processing unit offers a " serious advantage " over the competition , but due to the nature of cross @-@ platform development , titles that share the same assets will appear " very similar " . In other scenarios , designers may tap some of PS4 's additional power in a straightforward manner , to boost frame rate or output at a higher resolution , whereas games from Sony 's own first @-@ party studios that take full advantage of the hardware " will probably look significantly better than anything on the Xbox One . " 
 In response to concerns surrounding the possibility of DRM measures to hinder the resale of used games ( and in particular , the initial DRM policies of Xbox One , which did contain such restrictions ) , Jack <unk> explicitly stated during Sony 's E3 press conference that there would be " no restrictions " on the resale and trading of PS4 games on physical media , while software product development head Scott Rohde specified that Sony was planning to disallow online passes as well , going on to say that the policies were designed to be " consumer @-@ friendly , extremely retailer @-@ friendly , and extremely publisher @-@ friendly . " After Sony 's E3 2013 press conference , IGN responded positively to Sony 's attitude towards indie developers and trading games , stating they thought " most gamers would agree " that " if you care about games like [ Sony ] do , you 'll buy a PlayStation 4 . " PlayStation 4 's removable and upgradable hard drive also drew praise from IGN , with Scott Lowe commenting that the decision gave the console " another advantage " over the Xbox One , of which the hard drive cannot be accessed . 
 GameSpot called the PlayStation 4 " the gamer 's choice for next @-@ generation " , citing its price , lack of restrictive digital rights management , and most importantly , Sony 's efforts to " acknowledge its consumers " and " respect its audience " as major factors .

The Gadget Show gave a similar review complimenting the DualShock 4 's new triggers and control sticks , in addition to the new Remote Play feature , yet criticized the system 's lack of media support at launch . IGN compared the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 over various categories , allowing their readers to vote for their preferred system . The PS4 won every category offered , and IGN awarded the PS4 with their People 's Choice Award . 
 Shortly following the launch , it became apparent that some games released on multiple platforms were available in higher resolutions on the PS4 as opposed to other video game consoles . Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku reported on the differences in early games such as Call of Duty : Ghosts and Assassin 's Creed IV : Black Flag which ran in 720p and 900p , respectively , on the Xbox One yet ran at 1080p on the PS4 .

 = Elizabeth Cady Stanton = 
 Elizabeth Cady Stanton ( November 12 , 1815 – October 26 , 1902 ) was an American suffragist , social activist , abolitionist , and leading figure of the early women 's rights movement . Her Declaration of Sentiments , presented at the Seneca Falls Convention held in 1848 in Seneca Falls , New York , is often credited with initiating the first organized women 's rights and women 's suffrage movements in the United States . Stanton was president of the National Woman Suffrage Association from 1892 until 1900 . 
 Before Stanton narrowed her political focus almost exclusively to women 's rights , she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton ( co @-@ founder of the Republican Party ) and cousin Gerrit Smith . Unlike many of those involved in the women 's rights movement , Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights . Her concerns included women 's parental and custody rights , property rights , employment and income rights , divorce , the economic health of the family , and birth control . She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th @-@ century temperance movement . 
 After the American Civil War , Stanton 's commitment to female suffrage caused a schism in the women 's rights movement when she , together with Susan B. Anthony , declined to support passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution . She opposed giving added legal protection and voting rights to African American men while women , black and white , were denied those same rights . Her position on this issue , together with her thoughts on organized Christianity and women 's issues beyond voting rights , led to the formation of two separate women 's rights organizations that were finally rejoined , with Stanton as president of the joint organization , approximately twenty years after her break from the original women 's suffrage movement . Stanton died in 1902 having authored both The Woman 's Bible and her autobiography Eighty Years and More , along with many articles and pamphlets concerning female suffrage and women 's rights . 
 = = Childhood and family background = = 
 Elizabeth Cady Stanton , the eighth of 11 children , was born in Johnstown , New York , to Daniel Cady and Margaret Livingston Cady . Five of her siblings died in early childhood or infancy . A sixth sibling , her elder brother Eleazar , died at age 20 just prior to his graduation from Union College in Schenectady , New York . Only Elizabeth Cady and four sisters lived well into adulthood and old age . Later in life , Elizabeth named her two daughters after two of her sisters , Margaret and Harriot . 
 Daniel Cady , Stanton 's father , was a prominent Federalist attorney who served one term in the United States Congress ( 1814 – 1817 ) and later became both a circuit court judge and , in 1847 , a New York Supreme Court justice . Judge Cady introduced his daughter to the law and , together with her brother @-@ in @-@ law , Edward Bayard , planted the early seeds that grew into her legal and social activism . Even as a young girl , she enjoyed perusing her father 's law library and debating legal issues with his law clerks . It was this early exposure to law that , in part , caused Stanton to realize how disproportionately the law favored men over women , particularly over married women . Her realization that married women had virtually no property , income , employment , or even custody rights over their own children , helped set her course toward changing these inequities . 
 Stanton 's mother , Margaret Livingston Cady , a descendant of early Dutch settlers , was the daughter of Colonel James Livingston , an officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolution . Having fought at Saratoga and Quebec , Livingston assisted in the capture of Major John Andre at West Point , New York where Andre and Benedict Arnold , who escaped aboard the HMS Vulture , were planning to turn West Point over to the English . Margaret Cady , an unusually tall woman for her time , had a commanding presence , and Stanton routinely described her mother as " queenly . " While Stanton 's daughter , Harriot Stanton Blatch , remembers her grandmother as being fun , affectionate , and lively , Stanton herself did not apparently share such memories . Emotionally devastated by the loss of so many children , Margaret Cady fell into a depression , which kept her from being fully involved in the lives of her surviving children and left a maternal void in Stanton 's childhood . 
 With Stanton 's mother depressed , and since Stanton 's father contended with the loss of several children , including his eldest son Eleazar , by immersing himself in his work , many of the child rearing responsibilities fell to Stanton 's elder sister , Tryphena , eleven years her senior , and Tryphena 's husband , Edward Bayard . Bayard , a Union College classmate of Eleazar Cady 's and son of James A. Bayard , Sr. , a U.S. Senator from Wilmington , Delaware was , at the time of his engagement and marriage to Tryphena , an apprentice in Daniel Cady 's law office . He was instrumental in nurturing Stanton 's growing understanding of the explicit and implicit gender hierarchies within the legal system . 
 Slavery did not end in New York State until July 4 , 1827 , and , like many men of his day , Stanton 's father was a slaveowner . Peter Teabout , a slave in the Cady household who was later freed in Johnstown , took care of Stanton and her sister Margaret . While she makes no mention of Teabout 's position as a slave in her family 's household , he is remembered with particular fondness by Stanton in her memoir , Eighty Years & More . Among other things , she reminisces about the pleasure she took in attending the Episcopal church with Teabout , where she and her sisters enjoyed sitting with him in the back of the church rather than alone in front with the white families of the congregation . It seems it was , however , not immediately the fact that her family owned at least one slave , but her exposure to the abolition movement as a young woman visiting her cousin , Gerrit Smith , in <unk> , New York , that led to her staunch abolitionist sentiments . 
 = = Education and intellectual development = = 
 Unlike many women of her era , Stanton was formally educated . She attended Johnstown Academy , where she studied Latin , Greek , mathematics , religion , science , French , and writing until the age of 16 . At the Academy , she enjoyed being in co @-@ educational classes where she could compete intellectually and academically with boys her age and older . She won several academic awards and honors , including the award for Greek language . 
 In her memoir , Stanton credits the <unk> ' neighbor , Rev. Simon Hosack , with strongly encouraging her intellectual development and academic abilities at a time when she felt these were undervalued by her father . Writing of her brother Eleazar 's death in 1826 , Stanton remembers trying to comfort her father , saying that she would try to be all her brother had been . At the time , her father 's response devastated Stanton : " Oh , my daughter , I wish you were a boy ! " Understanding from this that her father valued boys above girls , Stanton tearfully took her disappointment to Hosack , whose firm belief in her abilities counteracted her father 's perceived disparagement . Hosack went on to teach Stanton Greek , encouraged her to read widely , and ultimately bequeathed to her his own Greek lexicon along with other books . His confirmation of her intellectual abilities strengthened Stanton 's confidence and self @-@ esteem . 
 Upon graduation from Johnstown Academy , Stanton received one of her first tastes of sexual discrimination . Stanton watched with dismay as the young men graduating with her , many of whom she had surpassed academically , went on to Union College , as her older brother , Eleazar , had done previously . In 1830 , with Union College taking only men , Stanton enrolled in the Troy Female Seminary in Troy , New York , which was founded and run by Emma Willard . ( In 1895 , the school was renamed the Emma Willard School in honor of its founder , and Stanton , spurred by her respect for Willard and despite her growing infirmities , was a keynote speaker at this event . ) 
 Early during her student days in Troy , Stanton remembers being strongly influenced by Charles Grandison Finney , an evangelical preacher and central figure in the revivalist movement . His influence , combined with the Calvinistic Presbyterianism of her childhood , caused her great unease . After hearing Finney speak , Stanton became terrified at the possibility of her own damnation : " Fear of judgment seized my soul . Visions of the lost haunted my dreams . Mental anguish prostrated my health . <unk> of my reason was apprehended by my friends . " Stanton credits her father and brother @-@ in @-@ law , Edward Bayard , with convincing her to ignore Finney 's warnings . She further credits their taking her on a rejuvenating trip to Niagara Falls with restoring her reason and sense of balance . She never returned to organized Christianity and , after this experience , always maintained that logic and a humane sense of ethics were the best guides to both thought and behavior . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 As a young woman , Elizabeth Cady met Henry Brewster Stanton through her early involvement in the temperance and the abolition movements . Henry Stanton was an acquaintance of Elizabeth Cady 's cousin , Gerrit Smith , an abolitionist and member of the " Secret Six " that supported John Brown 's raid at Harpers Ferry , West Virginia . Stanton was a journalist , an antislavery orator , and , after his marriage to Elizabeth Cady , an attorney . Despite Daniel Cady 's reservations , the couple was married in 1840 , with Elizabeth Cady requesting of the minister that the phrase " promise to obey " be removed from the wedding vows . She later wrote , " I obstinately refused to obey one with whom I supposed I was entering into an equal relation . " The couple had six children between 1842 and 1856 . Their seventh and last child , Robert , was an unplanned baby born in 1859 when Elizabeth Cady Stanton was forty @-@ four . 
 Soon after returning to the United States from their European honeymoon , the Stantons moved into the Cady household in Johnstown . Henry Stanton studied law under his father @-@ in @-@ law until 1843 , when the Stantons moved to ( Chelsea ) Boston , Massachusetts , where Henry joined a law firm . While living in Boston , Elizabeth thoroughly enjoyed the social , political , and intellectual stimulation that came with a constant round of abolitionist gatherings and meetings . Here , she enjoyed the company of and was influenced by such people as Frederick Douglass , William Lloyd Garrison , Louisa May Alcott , and Ralph Waldo Emerson , among others . Throughout her marriage and eventual widowhood , Stanton took her husband 's surname as part of her own , signing herself Elizabeth Cady Stanton or E. Cady Stanton , but she refused to be addressed as Mrs. Henry B. Stanton . Asserting that women were individual persons , she stated that , " the custom of calling women Mrs. John This and Mrs. Tom That and colored men Sambo and Zip Coon , is founded on the principle that white men are lords of all . " 
 The Stanton marriage was not entirely without tension and disagreement . Henry Stanton , like Daniel Cady , disagreed with the notion of female suffrage . Because of employment , travel , and financial considerations , husband and wife lived more often apart than together . Friends of the couple found them very similar in temperament and ambition , but quite dissimilar in their views on certain issues including women 's rights . In 1842 , abolitionist reformer Sarah Grimke counseled Elizabeth in a letter : " Henry greatly needs a humble , holy companion and thou <unk> the same . " However , both Stantons considered their marriage an overall success , and the marriage lasted for 47 years , ending with Henry Stanton 's death in 1887 . 
 In 1847 , concerned about the effect of New England winters on Henry Stanton 's fragile health , the Stantons moved from Boston to Seneca Falls , New York , situated at the northern end of Cayuga Lake , one of the Finger Lakes found in upstate New York . Their house , purchased for them by Daniel Cady , was located some distance from town . The couple 's last four children — two sons and two daughters — were born there , with Stanton asserting that her children were conceived under a program she called " voluntary motherhood . " In an era when it was commonly held that a wife must submit to her husband 's sexual demands , Stanton firmly believed that women should have command over their sexual relationships and childbearing . As a mother who advocated homeopathy , freedom of expression , lots of outdoor activity , and a solid , highly academic education for all of her children , Stanton nurtured a breadth of interests , activities , and learning in both her sons and daughters . She was remembered by her daughter Margaret as being " cheerful , sunny and indulgent " . 
 Although she enjoyed motherhood and assumed primary responsibility for rearing the children , Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed by the lack of intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls . As an antidote to the boredom and loneliness , Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and , by 1848 , had established ties to similarly minded women in the area . By this time , she was firmly committed to the nascent women 's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism . 
 = = Early activism in the women 's rights movement = = 
 Prior to living in Seneca Falls , Stanton had become an admirer and friend of Lucretia Mott , the Quaker minister , feminist , and abolitionist whom she had met at the World Anti @-@ Slavery Convention in London , England in the spring of 1840 while on her honeymoon . The two women became allies when the male delegates attending the convention voted that women should be denied participation in the proceedings , even if they , like Mott , had been nominated to serve as official delegates of their respective abolitionist societies . After considerable debate , the women were required to sit in a roped @-@ off section hidden from the view of the men in attendance . They were soon joined by the prominent abolitionist , William Lloyd Garrison , who arrived after the vote had been taken and , in protest of the outcome , refused his seat , electing instead to sit with the women . 
 Mott 's example and the decision to prohibit women from participating in the convention strengthened Stanton 's commitment to women 's rights . By 1848 , her early life experiences , together with the experience in London and her initially debilitating experience as a housewife in Seneca Falls , galvanized Stanton . She later wrote : 
 " The general discontent I felt with woman 's portion as wife , housekeeper , physician , and spiritual guide , the chaotic conditions into which everything fell without her constant supervision , and the wearied , anxious look of the majority of women , impressed me with a strong feeling that some active measures should be taken to remedy the wrongs of society in general , and of women in particular . My experience at the World Anti @-@ slavery Convention , all I had read of the legal status of women , and the oppression I saw everywhere , together swept across my soul , intensified now by many personal experiences . It seemed as if all the elements had conspired to impel me to some onward step . I could not see what to do or where to begin — my only thought was a public meeting for protest and discussion . " 
 In 1848 , acting on these feelings and perceptions , Stanton joined Mott , Mott 's sister Martha Coffin Wright , and a handful of other women in Seneca Falls . Together they organized the Seneca Falls Convention held in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20 . Over 300 people attended . Stanton drafted a Declaration of Sentiments , which she read at the convention . Modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence , Stanton 's declaration proclaimed that men and women are created equal . She proposed , among other things , a then @-@ controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women . The final resolutions , including female suffrage , were passed , in no small measure , because of the support of Frederick Douglass , who attended and informally spoke at the convention . 
 Soon after the convention , Stanton was invited to speak at a second women 's rights convention in Rochester , New York , solidifying her role as an activist and reformer . Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis invited her to speak at the first National Women 's Rights Convention in 1850 , but because of pregnancy , Stanton chose instead to lend her name to the list of sponsors and send a speech to be read in her stead . In 1851 , Stanton was introduced to Susan B. Anthony on a street in Seneca Falls by Amelia Bloomer , a feminist and mutual acquaintance who had not signed the Declaration of Sentiments and subsequent resolutions despite her attendance at the Seneca Falls convention . 
 Although best known for their joint work on behalf of women 's suffrage , Stanton and Anthony first joined the temperance movement . Together , they were instrumental in founding the short @-@ lived Woman 's State Temperance Society ( 1852 – 1853 ) . During her presidency of the organization , Stanton scandalized many supporters by suggesting that drunkenness be made sufficient cause for divorce . But the relationship between the women 's suffrage movement and the temperance movement was hardly accidental . The two movements had common interests , with women 's suffrage filling the role of cause and prohibition becoming the effect . Later , in state after state , once women gained the right to vote , they could press for various political measures to reduce drunkenness , perceived to be largely a problem involving the male sex . Thus the two movement became frequently allied . 
 Stanton and Anthony 's focus , however , soon shifted to female suffrage and women 's rights , activities which inexorably brought them into acquaintance with Alice Cary and Phoebe Cary ; for a short time Phoebe Cary served as editor of Anthony 's newspaper , Revolution . 
 Single and having no children , Anthony had the time and energy to do the speaking and traveling that Stanton was unable to do . Their skills complemented each other ; Stanton , the better orator and writer , scripted many of Anthony 's speeches , while Anthony was the movement 's organizer and tactician . Stanton once wrote to Anthony , " No power in heaven , hell or earth can separate us , for our hearts are eternally wedded together . " Likewise , when writing a tribute that appeared in The New York Times when Stanton died , Anthony described Stanton as having " forged the thunderbolts " that she ( Anthony ) " fired . " Unlike Anthony 's relatively narrow focus on suffrage , Stanton wanted to push for a broader platform of women 's rights in general . While their opposing viewpoints led to some discussion and conflict , no disagreement threatened their friendship or working relationship ; the two women remained close friends and colleagues until Stanton 's death some 50 years after their initial meeting . While always recognized as movement leaders whose support was sought , Stanton and Anthony 's voices were soon joined by others who began assuming leadership positions within the movement . These women included , among others , Matilda Joslyn Gage . 
 = = Stanton 's Speech Regarding the Destructive Male = = 
 In 1868 at the Women 's Suffrage Convention in Washington , D.C. Elizabeth Cady Stanton , at age 52 , gave a powerful speech which begins as such : " I urge a sixteenth amendment , because ' manhood suffrage , ' or a man 's government , is civil , religious , and social disorganization . The male element is a destructive force , stern , selfish , aggrandizing , loving war , violence , conquest , acquisition , breeding in the material and moral world alike discord , disorder , disease , and death . See what a record of blood and cruelty the pages of history reveal ! Through what slavery , slaughter , and sacrifice , through what inquisitions and imprisonments , pains and persecutions , black codes and gloomy creeds , the soul of humanity has struggled for the centuries , while mercy has veiled her face and all hearts have been dead alike to love and hope ! " 
 The speech ends as such " With violence and disturbance in the natural world , we see a constant effort to maintain an equilibrium of forces . Nature , like a loving mother , is ever trying to keep land and sea , mountain and valley , each in its place , to hush the angry winds and waves , balance the extremes of heat and cold , of rain and drought , that peace , harmony , and beauty may reign supreme . There is a striking analogy between matter and mind , and the present disorganization of society warns us that in the dethronement of woman we have let loose the elements of violence and ruin that she only has the power to curb . If the civilization of the age calls for an extension of the suffrage , surely a government of the most virtuous educated men and women would better represent the whole and protect the interests of all than could the representation of either sex alone . " 
 = = Ideological divergence with abolitionists and the women 's rights movement = = 
 After the American Civil War , both Stanton and Anthony broke with their abolitionist backgrounds and lobbied strongly against ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution , which granted African American men the right to vote . Believing that African American men , by virtue of the Thirteenth Amendment , already had the legal protections , except for suffrage , offered to white male citizens and that so largely expanding the male franchise in the country would only increase the number of voters prepared to deny women the right to vote , both Stanton and Anthony were angry that the abolitionists , their former partners in working for both African American and women 's rights , refused to demand that the language of the amendments be changed to include women . 
 Eventually , Stanton 's oppositional rhetoric took on racial overtones . Arguing on behalf of female suffrage , Stanton posited that women voters of " wealth , education , and refinement " were needed to offset the effect of former slaves and immigrants whose " pauperism , ignorance , and degradation " might negatively affect the American political system . She declared it to be " a serious question whether we had better stand aside and see ' Sambo ' walk into the kingdom [ of civil rights ] first . " Some scholars have argued that Stanton 's emphasis on property ownership and education , opposition to black male suffrage , and desire to hold out for universal suffrage fragmented the civil rights movement by pitting African @-@ American men against women and , together with Stanton 's emphasis on " educated suffrage , " in part established a basis for the literacy requirements that followed in the wake of the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment . 
 Stanton 's position caused a significant rift between herself and many civil rights leaders , particularly Frederick Douglass , who believed that white women , already empowered by their connection to fathers , husbands , and brothers , at least vicariously had the vote . According to Douglass , their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated African American men , who lacked women 's indirect empowerment , to voting rights before women were granted the franchise . African American women , he believed , would have the same degree of empowerment as white women once African American men had the vote ; hence , general female suffrage was , according to Douglass , of less concern than black male suffrage . 
 Disagreeing with Douglass , and despite the racist language she sometimes resorted to , Stanton firmly believed in a universal franchise that empowered blacks and whites , men and women . Speaking on behalf of black women , she stated that not allowing them to vote condemned African American freedwomen " to a triple bondage that man never knows , " that of slavery , gender , and race . She was joined in this belief by Anthony , Olympia Brown , and most especially Frances Gage , who was the first suffragist to champion voting rights for freedwomen . 
 Thaddeus Stevens , a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and ardent abolitionist , agreed that voting rights should be universal . In 1866 , Stanton , Anthony , and several other suffragists drafted a universal suffrage petition demanding that the right to vote be given without consideration of sex or race . The petition was introduced in the United States Congress by Stevens . Despite these efforts , the Fourteenth Amendment was passed , without adjustment , in 1868 . 
 By the time the Fifteenth Amendment was making its way through Congress , Stanton 's position had led to a major schism in the women 's rights movement itself . Many leaders in the women 's rights movement , including Lucy Stone , Elizabeth Blackwell , and Julia Ward Howe , strongly argued against Stanton 's " all or nothing " position . By 1869 , disagreement over ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment had given birth to two separate women 's suffrage organizations . The National Woman Suffrage Association ( NWSA ) was founded in May , 1869 by Anthony and Stanton , who served as its president for 21 years . The NWSA opposed passage of the Fifteenth Amendment without changes to include female suffrage and , under Stanton 's influence in particular , championed a number of women 's issues that were deemed too radical by more conservative members of the suffrage movement . The better @-@ funded , larger , and more representative woman suffragist vehicle , the American Woman Suffrage Association ( AWSA ) , founded the following November and led by Stone , Blackwell , and Howe , supported the Fifteenth Amendment as written . Following passage of that Amendment the AWSA preferred to focus only on female suffrage rather than advocate for the broader women 's rights espoused by Stanton : gender @-@ neutral divorce laws , a woman 's right to refuse her husband sexually , increased economic opportunities for women , and the right of women to serve on juries . 
 Believing that men should not be given the right to vote without women also being granted the franchise , Sojourner Truth , a former slave and feminist , affiliated herself with Stanton and Anthony 's organization . Stanton , Anthony , and Truth were joined by Matilda Joslyn Gage , who later worked on The Woman 's Bible with Stanton . Despite Stanton 's position and the efforts of her and others to expand the Fifteenth Amendment to include voting rights for all women , this amendment also passed , as it was originally written , in 1870 . 
 In her later years , Stanton became interested in efforts to create cooperative communities and work places . She was also attracted to various forms of political radicalism , applauding the Populist movement and identifying herself with socialism , especially Fabian socialism . 
 = = Later years = = 
 In the decade following ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment , both Stanton and Anthony increasingly took the position , first advocated by Victoria Woodhull , that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments actually did give women the right to vote . They argued that the Fourteenth Amendment , which defined citizens as " all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , " included women and that the Fifteenth Amendment provided all citizens with the right to vote . Using this logic , they asserted that women now had the constitutional right to vote and that it was simply a matter of claiming that right . This constitution @-@ based argument , which came to be called " the new departure " in women 's rights circles because of its divergence from earlier attempts to change voting laws on a state @-@ by @-@ state basis , led to first Anthony ( in 1872 ) , and later Stanton ( in 1880 ) , going to the polls and demanding to vote . Despite this , and similar attempts made by hundreds of other women , it would be nearly 50 years before women obtained the right to vote throughout the United States . 
 During this time , Stanton maintained a broad focus on women 's rights in general rather than narrowing her focus only to female suffrage in particular . After passage of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 and its support by the Equal Rights Association and prominent suffragists such as Stone , Blackwell , and Howe , the gap between Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other leaders of the women 's movement widened as Stanton took issue with the fundamental religious leanings of several movement leaders . Unlike many of her colleagues , Stanton believed organized Christianity relegated women to an unacceptable position in society . She explored this view in the 1890s in The Woman 's Bible , which elucidated a feminist understanding of biblical scripture and sought to correct the fundamental sexism Stanton believed was inherent to organized Christianity . Likewise , Stanton supported divorce rights , employment rights , and property rights for women , issues in which the American Women 's Suffrage Association ( AWSA ) preferred not to become involved . 
 Her more radical positions included acceptance of interracial marriage . Despite her opposition to giving African American men the right to vote without enfranchising all women and the derogatory language she had resorted to in expressing this opposition , Stanton had no objection to interracial marriage and wrote a congratulatory letter to Frederick Douglass upon his marriage to Helen Pitts , a white woman , in 1884 . Anthony , fearing public condemnation of the National Woman Suffrage Association ( NWSA ) and wanting to keep the demand for female suffrage foremost , pleaded with Stanton not to make her letter to Douglass or support for his marriage publicly known . 
 Stanton went on to write some of the most influential books , documents , and speeches of the women 's rights movement . Starting in 1876 , Stanton , Anthony , and Gage collaborated to write the first volume of History of Woman Suffrage , a seminal , six @-@ volume work containing the full history , documents , and letters of the woman 's suffrage movement . The first two volumes were published in 1881 and the third in 1886 ; the work was eventually completed in 1922 by Ida Harper . Stanton 's other major writings included the two @-@ part The Woman 's Bible , published in 1895 and 1898 ; Eighty Years & More : Reminiscences 1815 – 1897 , her autobiography , published in 1898 ; and The Solitude of Self , or " Self @-@ Sovereignty , " which she first delivered as a speech at the 1892 convention of the National American Woman 's Suffrage Association in Washington , D.C. 
 In 1868 Stanton , together with Susan B. Anthony and Parker Pillsbury , a leading male feminist of his day , began publishing a weekly periodical , Revolution , with editorials by Stanton that focused on a wide array of women 's issues . In a view different from many modern feminists , Stanton , who supported birth control and likely used it herself , believed that both the killing of infants and abortion could be considered infanticide , a position she discussed in Revolution . At this time , Stanton also joined the New York Lyceum Bureau , embarking on a 12 @-@ year career on the Lyceum Circuit . Traveling and lecturing for eight months every year provided her both with the funds to put her two youngest sons through college and , given her popularity as a lecturer , with a way to spread her ideas among the general population , gain broad public recognition , and further establish her reputation as a preeminent leader in the women 's rights movement . Among her most popular speeches were " Our Girls " , " Our Boys " , " Co @-@ education " , " Marriage and Divorce " , " Prison Life " , and " The Bible and Woman 's Rights " . Her lecture travels so occupied her that Stanton , although president , presided at only four of 15 conventions of the National Woman 's Suffrage Association during this period . 
 In addition to her writing and speaking , Stanton was also instrumental in promoting women 's suffrage in various states , particularly New York , Missouri , Kansas , where it was included on the ballot in 1867 , and Michigan , where it was put to a vote in 1874 . She made an unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Congressional seat from New York in 1866 , and she was the primary force behind the passage of the Woman 's Property Bill that was eventually passed by the New York State Legislature . She worked toward female suffrage in Wyoming , Utah , and California , and in 1878 , she convinced California Senator Aaron A. Sargent to introduce a female suffrage amendment using wording similar to that of the Fifteenth Amendment passed some eight years previously . 
 Stanton was also active internationally , spending a great deal of time in Europe , where her daughter and fellow feminist Harriot Stanton Blatch lived . In 1888 , she helped prepare for the founding of the International Council of Women . In 1890 , Stanton opposed the merger of the National Woman 's Suffrage Association with the more conservative and religiously based American Woman Suffrage Association . Over her objections , the organizations merged , creating the National American Woman Suffrage Association ( NAWSA ) . Despite her opposition to the merger , Stanton became its first president , largely because of Susan B. Anthony 's intervention . In good measure because of The Woman 's Bible and her position on issues such as divorce she was , however , never popular among the more religiously conservative members of the " National American " . 
 On January 18 , 1892 , approximately ten years before she died , Stanton joined Anthony , Stone , and Isabella Beecher Hooker to address the issue of suffrage before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary . After nearly five decades of fighting for female suffrage and women 's rights , it was Elizabeth Cady Stanton 's final appearance before members of the United States Congress . Using the text of what became The Solitude of Self , she spoke of the central value of the individual , noting that value was not based on gender . As with the Declaration of Sentiments she had penned some 45 years earlier , Stanton 's statement expressed not only the need for women 's voting rights in particular , but the need for a revamped understanding of women 's position in society and even of women in general : 
 " The isolation of every human soul and the necessity of self @-@ dependence must give each individual the right to choose his own surroundings . The strongest reason for giving woman all the opportunities for higher education , for the full development of her faculties , her forces of mind and body ; for giving her the most enlarged freedom of thought and action ; a complete emancipation from all forms of bondage , of custom , dependence , superstition ; from all the crippling influences of fear — is the solitude and personal responsibility of her own individual life . The strongest reason why we ask for woman a voice in the government under which she lives ; in the religion she is asked to believe ; equality in social life , where she is the chief factor ; a place in the trades and professions , where she may earn her bread , is because of her birthright to self @-@ sovereignty ; because , as an individual , she must rely on herself [ ... ] . " 
 Lucy Stone was so impressed with the brilliance of Stanton 's speech that she published The Solitude of Self in its entirety in the Woman 's Journal , leaving out her own speech to the committee . 
 Stanton strongly supported the Spanish – American War in 1898 , writing : " Though I hate war per se , I am glad that it has come in this instance . I would like to see Spain ... swept from the face of the earth . " 
 = = Death , burial , and remembrance = = 
 Stanton died of heart failure at her home in New York City on October 26 , 1902 , 18 years before women were granted the right to vote in the United States . Survived by six of her seven children and by seven grandchildren , she was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx , New York City , the grave upon which there is a monument for her and her husband . Although Elizabeth Cady Stanton had been unable to attend a formal college or university , her daughters did . Margaret Livingston Stanton Lawrence attended Vassar College ( 1876 ) and Columbia University ( 1891 ) , and Harriot Stanton Blatch received both her undergraduate and graduate degrees from Vassar College in 1878 and 1891 respectively . 
 After Stanton 's death , her unorthodox ideas about religion and emphasis on female employment and other women 's issues led many suffragists to focus on Anthony , rather than Stanton , as the founder of the women 's suffrage movement . Stanton 's controversial publishing of The Woman 's Bible in 1895 had alienated more religiously traditional suffragists , and had cemented Anthony 's place as the more readily recognized leader of the female suffrage movement . Anthony continued to work with NAWSA and became more familiar to many of the younger members of the movement . By 1923 , in celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention , only Harriot Stanton Blatch paid tribute to the role her mother had played in instigating the women 's rights movement . Even as late as 1977 , Anthony received the most attention as the founder of the movement , while Stanton was not mentioned . 
 Over time , however , Stanton received more attention . Stanton was commemorated along with Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony in a sculpture by Adelaide Johnson at the United States Capitol , unveiled in 1921 . Originally kept on display in the crypt of the US Capitol , the sculpture was moved to its current location and more prominently displayed in the rotunda in 1997 . The Elizabeth Cady Stanton House in Seneca Falls was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965 . Her house in Tenafly , New Jersey , was declared a landmark in 1975 . Years later , 37 Park Row , the site of the original office of Stanton and Anthony 's newspaper , The Revolution , was included in the map of Manhattan historical sites related or dedicated to important women created by the Office of the Manhattan Borough President in March , 2008 . She is commemorated , together with Amelia Bloomer , Sojourner Truth , and Harriet Ross Tubman , in the calendar of saints of the Episcopal Church on July 20 . In 1999 , interest in Stanton was popularly rekindled when Ken Burns and others produced the documentary Not for Ourselves Alone : The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton & Susan B. Anthony . Once again , attention was drawn to her central , founding role in shaping not only the woman 's suffrage movement , but a broad women 's rights movement in the United States that included women 's suffrage , women 's legal reform , and women 's roles in society as a whole .

 = George Pickett = 
 George Edward Pickett ( January 16 , 1825 – July 30 , 1875 ) was a career United States Army officer who became a major general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War . He is best remembered for his participation in the futile and bloody Confederate offensive on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg that bears his name , Pickett 's Charge . 
 Pickett graduated last out of 59 cadets in the West Point Class of 1846 . He served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army during the Mexican @-@ American War , and is noted for his service in the Battle of Chapultepec in September 1847 . After this , he served in the Washington Territory , and eventually reached the rank of captain . Pickett participated in the Pig War of 1859 . Near the beginning of the American Civil War , he enlisted in the Confederate Army , and he attained the rank of brigadier general in January 1862 . He commanded a brigade that saw heavy action during the Peninsula Campaign of 1862 . Pickett was wounded at the Battle of Gaines 's Mill on June 27 . 
 He did not return to command until September , following the Battle of Antietam , when he was given command of a division in the Right Wing of the Army of Northern Virginia , commanded by Major General James Longstreet , which became the I Corps that December . His division was lightly engaged at the Battle of Fredericksburg , and , along with most of Longstreet 's Corps , missed the Battle of Chancellorsville while participating in the Suffolk Campaign in 1863 . During the Gettysburg Campaign , his division was , much to Pickett 's frustration , the last to arrive on the field . However , it was one of three divisions under the command of General Longstreet to participate in a disastrous assault on Union positions on July 3 , the final day of the battle . The attack has been given the name " Pickett 's Charge " . In February 1864 , Pickett commanded the Confederate forces at the Battle of New Bern , and ordered the execution of 22 Confederate deserters found to be fighting amongst the U.S. troops . On April 1 , 1865 , he was defeated while in overall command of Confederate troops at the Battle of Five Forks . 
 Following the war , Pickett feared prosecution for his execution of deserters and temporarily fled to Canada . He returned to Virginia in 1866 , where he died at age 50 in 1875 . Legend says that after the war he remained bitter and dwelt extensively upon the loss of his men at Gettysburg . 
 = = Early life = = 
 George Edward Pickett was born in his grandfather 's shop in Richmond , Virginia on January 16 , 1825 . He was the first of the eight children of Robert and Mary Pickett , a prominent family of Old Virginia of English origins , and one of the " first families " of Virginia . He was the cousin of future Confederate general Henry Heth . He went to Springfield , Illinois , to study law , but at the age of 17 he was appointed to the United States Military Academy . Legend has it that Pickett 's West Point appointment was secured for him by Abraham Lincoln , but this is largely believed to be a story circulated by his widow following his death . Lincoln , as an Illinois state legislator , could not nominate candidates , although he did give the young man advice after he was accepted . Pickett was actually appointed by Illinois Congressman John T. Stuart , a friend of Pickett 's uncle and a law partner of Lincoln . 
 Pickett was popular as a cadet at West Point . He was mischievous and a player of pranks , " ... a man of ability , but belonging to a cadet set that appeared to have no ambition for class standing and wanted to do only enough study to secure their graduation . " At a time when often a third of the class left before graduation , Pickett persisted , working off his demerits and doing enough in his studies to graduate , ranking last out of the 59 surviving students in the Class of 1846 . It is a position held with some backhanded distinction , referred to today as the " goat " , both for its stubbornness and tenacity . Pickett 's cousin Henry Heth graduated last in the Class of 1847 .

 Pickett was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the U.S. 8th Infantry Regiment . He soon gained national recognition in the Mexican – American War when he carried the American colors over the parapet during the Battle of Chapultepec in September 1847 . Wounded at the base of the wall , Pickett 's friend and colleague Lieutenant James Longstreet handed him the colors . Pickett carried the flag over the wall and fought his way to the roof of the palace , unfurling it over the fortress and announcing its surrender . He received a brevet promotion to captain following this action . 
 In 1849 , while serving on the Texas frontier after the war , he was promoted to first lieutenant and then to captain in the 9th U.S. Infantry in 1855 . In 1853 , Pickett challenged a fellow junior officer , future Union general Winfield Scott Hancock , to a duel ; ( they had met only briefly when Hancock was passing through Texas ) . Hancock declined the duel , a response not unlikely as dueling had fallen out of favor at the time . 
 In January 1851 , Pickett married Sally Harrison Minge , the daughter of Dr. John Minge of Virginia , the great @-@ great @-@ grandniece of President William Henry Harrison , and the great @-@ great @-@ granddaughter of Benjamin Harrison , a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence . Sally died during childbirth that November , at Fort Gates , Texas . 
 Pickett next served in the Washington Territory . In 1856 he commanded the construction of Fort Bellingham on Bellingham Bay , in what is today the city of Bellingham , Washington . He also built a frame home that year which still stands ; Pickett House is the oldest house in Bellingham and the oldest house on its original foundation in the Pacific Northwest . While posted to Fort Bellingham , Pickett married a Native American woman of the Haida tribe , Morning Mist , who gave birth to a son , James Tilton Pickett ( 1857 – 1889 ) ; Morning Mist died a few months later . " Jimmy " Pickett made a name for himself as a newspaper artist , before dying of tuberculosis at the age of 32 near Portland , Oregon . 
 In 1859 Pickett was dispatched in command of Company D , 9th U.S. Infantry , to garrison San Juan Island in response to discord that had arisen there between American farmers and the Hudson 's Bay Company . The confrontation was instigated when American farmer Lyman Cutler shot and killed a pig that had repeatedly broken into his garden . The pig belonged to the Hudson 's Bay Company , and though Cutler was prepared to pay a fair price for the pig , the Company was not satisfied , insisting he be brought before the British magistrate , thus initiating the territorial dispute that came to be known as the Pig War . In response to the U.S. forces , the British sent a force of three warships and 1000 men . The British commander demanded that Pickett and his men leave . Pickett declined , and the British officer returned to his frigate , threatening to land his own men . Pickett with his 68 men appeared to be fully prepared to oppose a British landing , ordering them into a line of battle near the beach . " Don 't be afraid of their big guns , " he told his men , " We 'll make a Bunker Hill of it . " Pickett 's presence and determination prevented the landing , the British being under orders to avoid armed conflict with United States forces , if possible . After initial tensions passed the crisis was averted , both sides being unwilling to go to war over a pig . President James Buchanan dispatched Brevet Lieutenant General Winfield Scott to negotiate a settlement between the parties .

 On April 19 , after the firing on Battle of Fort Sumter and President Lincoln 's call for 75 @,@ 000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion , Virginia joined four more Southern states in seceding from the Union . Native son Pickett journeyed from Oregon to serve his state . Arriving after the First Battle of Bull Run , he resigned his commission in the U.S. Army on June 25 , 1861 ; he had been holding a commission as a major in the Confederate States Army Artillery since March 16 . Within a month he was appointed colonel in command of the Rappahannock Line of the Department of Fredericksburg , under the command of Major General Theophilus H. Holmes . Holmes 's influence obtained a commission for Pickett as a brigadier general , dated January 14 , 1862 . 
 Pickett made a colorful general . He rode a sleek black charger named " Old Black , " and wore a small blue kepi @-@ style cap , with buffed gloves over the sleeves of an immaculately tailored uniform that had a double row of gold buttons on the coat , and shiny gold spurs on his highly polished boots . He held an elegant riding crop whether mounted or walking . His moustache drooped gracefully beyond the corners of his mouth and then turned upward at the ends . His hair was the talk of the Army : " long ringlets flowed loosely over his shoulders , trimmed and highly perfumed , his beard likewise was curling and giving up the scent of Araby . " 
 Pickett 's first combat command was during the Peninsula Campaign , leading a brigade that was nicknamed the Gamecocks ( the brigade would eventually be led by Richard B. Garnett in Pickett 's Charge ) . Pickett led his brigade ably in the battles of Williamsburg and Seven Pines , earning commendations from his superiors . At Gaines 's Mill he was shot off his horse while leading his brigade in its first assault . Pickett continued to move forward with his men for a while , leading his horse on foot . A second assault by Pickett 's brigade , led by Colonel Eppa Hunton , along with the brigade led by Cadmus Wilcox , broke the Union line . Pickett feared that he had taken a mortal blow to his shoulder , but the wound was initially assessed by others as minor . The shoulder wound turned out to be severe enough that , while not fatal , Pickett was out of action for the next three months , and his arm would remain stiff for at least a year . 
 When Pickett returned to the Army in September 1862 , following the Battle of Antietam , he was given command of a two @-@ brigade division in the corps commanded by his old colleague from Mexico , Major General Longstreet . Pickett was promoted to major general on October 10 . Shortly afterwards it was upgraded to five brigades , commanded by Generals Garnett , James Kemper , Lewis Armistead , Montgomery Dent Corse and Micah Jenkins . The division was only lightly engaged at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December . His division would not see serious combat until the Gettysburg Campaign the following summer . Longstreet and two of his divisions @-@ those commanded by Pickett and John Bell Hood @-@ were detached from Lee 's main army in April while participating in the Suffolk Campaign . They thus missed the Battle of Chancellorsville . The Suffolk Campaign was minor and inconclusive , while the Battle of Chancellorsville was an enormous Confederate victory . 
 Before the Gettysburg Campaign , Pickett fell in love with a Virginia teenager , LaSalle " Sallie " Corbell ( 1843 – 1931 ) , commuting back and forth from his duties in Suffolk to be with her . Although Sallie would later insist that she met him in 1852 ( at age 9 ) , she did not marry the 38 @-@ year @-@ old widower until November 13 , 1863 . The couple had two children , George Edward Pickett , Jr . ( born July 17 , 1864 ) and David Corbell Pickett ( born 1865 or 1866 ) . David died in late 1873 or January 1874 of measles . 
 = = = Gettysburg and Pickett 's Charge = = = 
 Pickett 's division arrived at the Battle of Gettysburg on the evening of the second day , July 2 , 1863 . It was reduced to 3 brigades present , Corse 's still being detached in Virginia and Jenkins ' transferred . It had been delayed by the assignment of guarding the Confederate lines of communication through Chambersburg , Pennsylvania . After two days of heavy fighting , General Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , which had initially driven the Union Army of the Potomac to the high ground south of Gettysburg , had been unable to dislodge the Union soldiers from their position . Lee 's plan for July 3 called for a massive assault on the center of the Union lines on Cemetery Ridge , calculating that Meade had concentrated his forces to protect his flanks while leaving his center weak . Lee directed General Longstreet to assemble a force of three divisions for the attack — two divisions from the corps of Lieutenant General A.P. Hill , under the temporary command of J. Johnston Pettigrew and Major General Isaac R. Trimble , which had both seen action on July 1 , and Pickett 's fresh division from Longstreet 's own corps . The center was occupied by the Union II Corps , commanded by Major General Winfield S. Hancock . Longstreet was technically in command , not Pickett . Nevertheless , the attack became known as " Pickett 's Charge " . In addition , much of the mythology of the Charge arose from newspaper reports . As Pickett was the only major general from Virginia to participate in the charge , the Virginia newspapers both played up their native son 's role and made the assault a more " glamorous " event . 
 Following a two @-@ hour artillery barrage meant to soften up the Union defenses , the three divisions stepped off across open fields almost a mile from Cemetery Ridge . Pickett inspired his men by shouting , " Up , Men , and to your posts ! Don 't forget today that you are from Old Virginia . " Pickett 's division , with the brigades of Brigadier Generals Armistead , Garnett , and Kemper , was on the right flank of the assault . It received punishing artillery fire , and then volleys of massed musket fire as it approached its objective . Armistead 's brigade made the farthest progress through the Union lines . Armistead was mortally wounded , falling near " The Angle " , at what is now termed the " High Water Mark of the Confederacy " . Neither of the other two divisions made comparable progress across the fields ; Armistead 's success was not reinforced , and his men were quickly killed or captured . 
 Pickett 's Charge was a bloodbath . While the Union suffered 1 @,@ 500 casualties , the Confederates had over 6 @,@ 000 . Over 50 % of the men sent across the fields were killed or wounded . Pickett 's division alone , out of about 5 @,@ 500 men , lost 224 killed , 1 @,@ 140 wounded , and 1 @,@ 499 missing / captured . Pickett 's three brigade commanders and all thirteen of his regimental commanders were casualties . Kemper was wounded , Garnett killed , and Armistead mortally wounded . Trimble and Pettigrew were the most senior casualties of the entire Confederate assault , the former losing a leg and the latter wounded in the hand and later mortally wounded during the retreat to Virginia . Pickett has received some historical criticism for establishing his final position well to the rear of his troops , most likely at the Codori farm on the Emmitsburg Road . Thomas R. Friend , who served Pickett as a courier , defended Pickett by writing that he " went as far as any Major General , Commanding a division , ought to have gone , and farther . " 
 As soldiers straggled back to the Confederate lines along Seminary Ridge , Lee feared a Union counteroffensive and tried to rally his center , telling returning soldiers that the failure was " all my fault . " Pickett was inconsolable . When Lee told Pickett to rally his division for the defense , Pickett allegedly replied , " General Lee , I have no division . " Pickett 's official report for the battle has never been found . It is rumored that Lee rejected it for its bitter negativity and demanded that it be rewritten , and an updated version was never filed .

 After the Battle of Gettysburg , Pickett commanded the Department of Southern Virginia and North Carolina . In February , Pickett was ordered to capture New Bern , North Carolina from Federal forces . The subsequent Battle of New Bern resulted in a Confederate defeat . Following the battle , Pickett ordered the execution of 22 Confederate deserters who were found to have joined the United States Army .

 Pickett then served as a division commander in the Defenses of Richmond . After P.G.T. Beauregard bottled up Benjamin Butler in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign , Pickett 's division was detached in support of Robert E. Lee 's operation in the Overland Campaign , just before the Battle of Cold Harbor , in which Pickett 's division occupied the center of the defensive line , a place in which the main Union attack did not occur . His division participated in the Siege of Petersburg . 
 = = = Battle of Five Forks = = = 
 General Pickett had received orders from Robert E. Lee to , with the Cavalry divisions of Major Generals William Henry Fitzhugh Lee and Thomas L. Rosser , hold the vital railroad crossing at Five Forks at all costs . On April 1 , at the Battle of Five Forks , their troops were attacked by a combined force under Major General Philip Henry Sheridan , which consisted of the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac , commanded by Major General Gouverneur K. Warren , and the Cavalry Corps of the Army , commanded by Brigadier General Wesley Merritt . Pickett , <unk> Lee , and Rosser were located behind the lines of their troops at the time of the attack , enjoying a shad bake while failing to inform their subordinate officers of their location . Meanwhile , Warren 's troops overwhelmed their left flank , and the Cavalry troops pinned the Confederates down elsewhere . By the time the Confederate commanders realized the catastrophe , it was too late to prevent the defeat . The result of the battle helped lead to the eventual capture of Richmond and the surrender of Lee 's army . 
 = = = Relief controversy = = = 
 A controversy existed over whether or not Pickett was relieved of his command in the final days of the war . After the war , Lee 's Chief of Staff , Lieutenant Colonel Walter H. Taylor , wrote that following the Battle of Sayler 's Creek on April 6 , 1865 , he had issued orders for Lee relieving Major Generals Richard H. Anderson and Bushrod R. Johnson , whose forces had been lost in the battle and who thereby no longer had troops under their command . In fact , Anderson had returned to his home in South Carolina following the battle . In addition , Taylor recollected that he had issued an order relieving Pickett as well . Pickett 's division was still intact , though reduced in number to about the size of a brigade . No copies of these orders exist . Douglas Southall Freeman , a biographer of Lee , supported this assertion , writing in 1935 that at the same time Lee relieved Anderson of command , he took the same action regarding Pickett and Bushrod Johnson , but the order regarding Pickett apparently never reached him . As late as April 11 he signed himself , " Maj. Genl . <unk> . " 
 In contradiction to this assertion , in his 1870 book Pickett 's Men Walter Harrison reprinted an order from Lieutenant Colonel Taylor to Pickett dated April 10 , 1865 , in which Taylor addressed Pickett as " Maj Gen G E Picket [ sic ] , General Commanding " The order was a request for an account of the movements and actions of Pickett 's Division from the time of the Battle of Five Forks on April 1 to the surrender at Appomattox on April 9 . In the report Pickett submitted he said : 
 The second day after the battle referred to ( Five Forks ) not being able to find General Anderson 's headquarters , I reported to Lieut . Gen. Longstreet , and continued to receive orders from him until the army was paroled and disbursed . " 
 Pickett 's official report to Taylor was signed " G.E. Pickett , Major @-@ Gen. , <unk> <unk> . " This is April 11 report mentioned by Freeman above . Thus in Pickett 's official report to Taylor he speaks of commanding his men and interacting with his superior officer right up until the surrender at Appomattox . Taylor attempted to explain the apparent contradiction by telling Fitzhugh Lee that he addressed his request in the manner he did because Pickett was not dismissed from the Army , and for the period in question Pickett was initially in command . This explanation , however , leaves unanswered the question of how Taylor expected Pickett to answer for the period of time Pickett purportedly was not in command . The explanation does not explain Pickett 's report which covered the entire period , nor the fact that Pickett signed the report as the acting commander , nor did it explain Longstreet 's interactions with Pickett over this period of time . Furthermore , there is no record of Taylor requesting reports from any other officers dismissed from the service on the movements of their former troops , nor of his referring to such officers in a manner which would connote active command . 
 The medical officer of Pickett 's division , Dr. M. G. Elzey , was with Pickett at the time of these events . Years later when an elderly Colonel John Mosby raised this issue in 1911 , Elzey wrote a letter to the Richmond Times @-@ Dispatch in answer to Mosby : 
 I was General Pickett 's personal medical advisor , and continued to be such until the time of his death . We rode together a greater part of the way during the retreat of our army from Petersburg to Appomattox . We escaped together from the battlefield at Sailor 's Creek and were constantly together until we reached Appomattox . I repeat it , therefore , with all confidence , that I am a competent witness to the fact that he was never under arrest , but remained in command of his Division until the last scene at Appomattox . 
 M. G. Elzey 
 In Longstreet 's final report , he makes no mention of any other officer being in charge of the unit . In point of fact his final report makes no mention of Pickett or his division . Pickett commanded the men remaining in his division and reported to Longstreet . These men surrendered with Pickett at Appomattox . Regarding Pickett and his division , no source can be produced which asserts anything otherwise . 
 = = = Appomattox = = = 
 On April 9 Pickett commanded his remaining troops in the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse , forming up in the final battle line of the Army of Northern Virginia . He surrendered with Lee 's army and was paroled at Appomattox Court House on April 9 , 1865 . 
 A legend told by Pickett 's widow stated that when the Union Army marched into Richmond , she received a surprise visitor . He acted graciously and inquired whether he had found the Pickett house . Abraham Lincoln himself had come to determine the fate of an old acquaintance before the wars , and Sallie , astonished , admitted she was his wife and held out her infant for the president to cradle . Lincoln historian Gerald J. <unk> has called this story a " fantasy " . 
 = = Postbellum life = = 
 Fearing prosecution for his execution of 22 deserters following the Battle of New Bern , which was then under investigation , Pickett fled with his wife and son to Canada . He remained out of the country for a year until hearing that , at the recommendation of Ulysses S. Grant , the investigation had ended . Pickett returned to the United States with his family in 1866 to work as an insurance agent and farmer in Norfolk , Virginia . 
 On June 23 , 1874 House Resolution 3086 , an " act to remove the political disabilities of George E. Pickett of Virginia " , was passed by the U.S. Congress . Pickett was granted a full pardon , about a year before his death . 
 Pickett lamented his men , lost in great number at Gettysburg . Late in his life , Colonel John Singleton Mosby , who had served under General J.E.B. Stuart , was present when Lee and Pickett met briefly after the war . He claimed their interaction was cold and reserved . Others present at the meeting refuted this , stating Lee only acted in his usual reserved and gentlemanly fashion . Pickett , Mosby said , complained bitterly after this meeting , saying to Mosby : " That man destroyed my division . " Mosby allegedly replied " Yes , but he made you immortal . " Most historians find the encounter as Mosby interpreted it unlikely . Asked by reporters why Pickett 's Charge failed , Pickett frequently replied : " I 've always thought the Yankees had something to do with it . " 
 George E. Pickett died in Norfolk , Virginia , on July 30 , 1875 . The cause of death was a liver abscess , although whether it was amoebic or bacterial is not clear . He was initially interred in Cedar Grove Cemetery in Norfolk . His remains were disinterred on October 23 and he was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond , Virginia on October 24 , 1875 . More than 40 @,@ 000 people lined the funeral route while another 5 @,@ 000 marched in the funeral procession . A memorial to Pickett was erected over his grave site and dedicated on October 5 , 1888 . The memorial was not , however , placed directly above Pickett 's burial site , and the exact location of his remains is not clear . 
 LaSalle Corbell Pickett died on March 22 , 1931 , having outlived her husband by more than 55 years . Initially , Hollywood Cemetery declined to allow her to be buried next to her husband . Pickett 's grandson , Lieutenant George E. Pickett III , threatened to have his grandfather disinterred and moved to Arlington National Cemetery where both grandparents could be buried side @-@ by @-@ side . Hollywood Cemetery quickly agreed to permit LaSalle 's interment at Hollywood , but this did not immediately occur for reasons which are not clear , and LaSalle was cremated and buried at Abbey Mausoleum in Arlington County , Virginia . Originally a mausoleum for the wealthy , it went bankrupt in 1968 . The structure fell into disrepair , and it was vandalized many times and several graves desecrated . In early 1998 , the Military Order of the Stars and Bars and United Daughters of the Confederacy worked together to pay for LaSalle 's disinterment and reburial in front of the George E. Pickett Memorial in Hollywood Cemetery . LaSalle Pickett was buried on Saturday , March 21 , 1998 . She was the first woman interred in the Confederate military burial section . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Decades after Pickett 's death , his widow LaSalle ( also known as " Sallie " and " Mother " ) became a well @-@ known writer and speaker on " her Soldier , " eventually leading to the creation of an idealized Pickett who was the perfect Southern gentleman and soldier . Much controversy attends LaSalle Pickett 's lionizing of her husband . LaSalle was the author of Pickett and His Men , a history of her husband 's military campaigns , which was published in 1899 . She published two other books in her deceased husband 's name , The Heart of a Soldier , As Revealed in the Intimate Letters of Gen 'l George E. Pickett ( published in 1913 ) and Soldier of the South : General Pickett 's War Letters to His Wife ( 1928 ) . These two writings have been described as " unreliable works that were fictionalized by Pickett 's wife . " As a result , General Pickett has become a figure partially obscured by " Lost Cause " mythology . Pickett today is widely perceived as being a tragic hero of sorts — a flamboyant officer who wanted to lead his troops into a glorious battle , but always missed the opportunity until the disastrous charge at Gettysburg . 
 Historian John C. Waugh wrote of Pickett , " An excellent brigade commander , he never proved he could handle a division . " He quotes George B. McClellan , the Union general , as saying : " Perhaps there is no doubt that he was the best infantry soldier developed on either side during the Civil War . " 
 Pickett 's grave is marked by a memorial in Hollywood Cemetery , which was placed there in 1888 . A monument to Pickett also stands in the American Camp on San Juan Island , Washington , erected by the Washington University Historical Society on October 21 , 1904 . 
 Fort Pickett in Blackstone , Virginia , is named in his honor . It was completed in 1942 and served as an active U.S. Army training facility in World War II and is currently occupied by the Virginia National Guard .

 Robert Granville " Bob " Lemon ( September 22 , 1920 – January 11 , 2000 ) was an American right @-@ handed pitcher and manager in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . Lemon was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a player in 1976 . 
 Lemon was raised in California where he played high school baseball and was the state player of the year in 1938 . At the age of 17 , Lemon began his professional baseball career in the Cleveland Indians organization , with whom he played for his entire professional career . Lemon was called up to Cleveland 's major league team as a utility player in 1941 . He then joined the United States Navy during World War II and returned to the Indians in 1946 . That season was the first Lemon would play at the pitcher position . 
 The Indians played in the 1948 World Series and were helped by Lemon 's two pitching wins as they won the club 's first championship since 1920 . In the early 1950s , Cleveland had a starting pitching rotation which included Lemon , Bob Feller , Mike Garcia and Early Wynn . During the 1954 season , Lemon had a career @-@ best 23 – 7 win – loss record and the Indians set a 154 @-@ game season AL @-@ record win mark when they won 111 games before they won the American League ( AL ) pennant . He was an All @-@ Star for seven consecutive seasons and recorded seven seasons of 20 or more pitching wins in a nine @-@ year period from 1948 – 1956 . 
 Lemon was a manager with the Kansas City Royals , Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees . He was named Manager of the Year with the White Sox and Yankees . In 1978 , he was fired as manager of the White Sox . He was named Yankees manager one month later and he led the team to a 1978 World Series title . Lemon became the first AL manager to win a World Series after assuming the managerial role in the middle of a season . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bob Lemon was born in San Bernardino , California . Lemon 's father , Earl Lemon , ran an ice business and later moved the family to Long Beach , California . There , Lemon attended Wilson Classical High School and played shortstop on the school 's baseball team . He was recognized as the state baseball player of the year by the California Interscholastic Federation ( CIF ) Southern Section in 1938 . 
 Later that same year , at the age of 17 , Lemon began his professional baseball career in the farm system of the Cleveland Indians as a member of the Oswego Netherlands of the Canadian – American League and later that year , the Middle Atlantic League 's Springfield Indians . In 75 games with the Netherlands he recorded a .312 batting average . The following season he played 80 games with Springfield , and hit .293 , and then joined the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association , where Lemon hit .309 . He spent the next two seasons at the Class A level with the Eastern League 's Wilkes @-@ Barre Barons as he hit .255 in 1940 and .301 in 1941 . In his final stint in the minors , Lemon hit .268 with 21 home runs for the 1942 Baltimore Orioles of the International League .

 Lemon 's major league debut came as a third baseman as a late season call @-@ up on September 9 , 1941 . He appeared in five games and collected one hit in five plate appearances . He was joined by catcher and fellow rookie Jim Hegan . He repeated the same number of games in the 1942 season and failed to record a hit . Lemon served in the United States Navy during World War II and missed the next three seasons . Before leaving for tour duty in 1943 , Lemon married Jane McGee . 
 Lemon was the Indians ' center fielder for Opening Day in 1946 . On April 30 , Indians pitcher Bob Feller no @-@ hit the New York Yankees ; Feller later wrote that Lemon 's " daring catch " and " throwing to and doubling a man off second base " were key in " saving my " no @-@ hitter . By season 's end , however , Lemon had entered more games as a pitcher than a utility player . Before that season , Lemon had only pitched one inning while with Oswego and another while with Wilkes @-@ Barre . Birdie Tebbetts of the Detroit Tigers and Johnny Pesky of the Boston Red Sox had played against Lemon in Navy baseball games , and they spoke to Indians player @-@ manager Lou Boudreau about switching Lemon from the outfield to the pitching mound . 
 Boudreau discussed the potential move to pitcher with Yankees catcher Bill Dickey , who had also played in the Navy with Lemon . " I knew Lemon had a strong arm , and once I realized he was not going to hit with consistency as an outfielder , I thought it would be worthwhile to look at him as a pitcher " , Boudreau later wrote . Lemon resisted the idea at first , but he agreed to the change after he learned that his salary could be higher as a pitcher . Lemon credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him to adjust to his new position . Indians pitching coach Mel Harder taught Lemon how to throw a slider , a key pitch in his repertoire . That same year , Indians owner Bill Veeck said that Lemon " some day will become the best pitcher in the American League . " Lemon finished the 1946 season with a losing record ( 4 – 5 ) , the only one he would have until 1957 , and a career @-@ low 2 @.@ 49 ERA . He followed up his inaugural season as a pitcher with an 11 – 5 record . He appeared in 19 games before August , largely as a relief pitcher , but he made his first start in July against the Boston Red Sox . During the last two months of the season , Lemon went 9 – 3 and pitched six complete games , including two 11 @-@ inning outings .

 Before the 1948 season started , team president Bill Veeck doubled Lemon 's contract amount . It would be Lemon 's first full season as a pitcher . Lemon was the Indians ' number @-@ two pitcher in the starting rotation , behind Bob Feller . On June 30 , 1948 , Lemon pitched a no @-@ hitter against the Detroit Tigers in a 2 – 0 win , earning his 11th win and fifth shutout of the season . He became the ninth Indians pitcher to record a no @-@ hitter and ended the season with an AL @-@ best 20 complete games . His ten shutouts on the season were the most in the majors . Lemon would go on to win the 1948 AL Pitcher of the Year Award . With three games remaining in the regular season , 20 @-@ game winner Lemon started the first game of their final series against Detroit . Lemon allowed three runs on seven hits and the Indians lost the game . Cleveland lost two games of the three @-@ game series , forcing a one @-@ game playoff with the Boston Red Sox . Speculation built up around which Indians pitcher Boudreau would send to the mound against the Red Sox on October 4 ; the choices were largely narrowed down to Lemon and Satchel Paige . Lemon was listed as Cleveland 's " probable pitcher " by United Press International in morning newspapers the day of the game , even though he would be working on two days of rest . Instead , Boudreau went with Gene Bearden , who would be pitching on one day of rest , and the choice was solidified when veteran second baseman Joe Gordon spoke up in support of Boudreau at a team meeting . The Indians won the game at Fenway Park by a score of 8 – 3 and prepared to face the Boston Braves in the World Series . 
 Boudreau started Feller in game one , which Cleveland lost . Lemon was the starter in the second game . Lemon faced Warren Spahn , and Cleveland won 4 – 1 . Lemon was named the starter for game six in Boston with the Indians leading the series 3 – 2 . He allowed three earned runs on eight hits and Cleveland had the lead when Lemon was replaced by Bearden . The Braves scored two runs in the bottom of the eighth inning but the Indians won the game , 4 – 3 , to clinch the franchise 's first World Series title since 1920 . Lemon was the only pitcher from either club to win two games in the Series . He finished the Series with a 1 @.@ 65 ERA . 
 Lemon 's hitting skills began to get attention as well . By August 1949 , Lemon was batting .295 with 11 extra @-@ base hits and six home runs , prompting Yankees manager Casey Stengel to comment , " Well , I see where the Indians have nine hitters in the lineup instead of eight . " Columnist Milton Richman wrote , " Lemon 's fine work at the plate has also conspired to tire him more . When the Indians get behind and Lemon is pitching , he rarely is yanked for a pinch hitter in the early innings . It 's a tough price he 's paying for batting fame . " In 1950 , Lemon led the major leagues in pitching wins ( 23 ) for the first time and he would win his second AL Pitcher of the Year Award . He pitched a six @-@ hit complete game over the Detroit Tigers in his last start of the season on September 29 . When Lemon signed a new contract before the 1951 season , the Indians made him the highest paid pitcher in baseball . At the beginning of the 1951 season , columnist Oscar Fraley pointed out that Lemon was one of only 12 active pitchers who had earned a winning record in four consecutive seasons . He finished the season with a 3 @.@ 52 ERA , lower than the 1950 season mark of 3 @.@ 84 when he led the majors with 23 wins , and a 17 – 14 record . The loss total was the most in the AL . He did not record his first shutout of the season until well into August , when he earned a three @-@ hit win over the Chicago White Sox . Upon completion of the 1952 season , Lemon recorded the second @-@ lowest ERA of his career , 2 @.@ 50 , and went 22 – 11 . His 28 complete games were a career @-@ high and led the AL .

 In 1954 he was 23 – 7 and won his third AL Pitcher of the Year Award as Cleveland won the pennant . The Indians set an AL record with 111 wins . ( The record stood until major league seasons were lengthened to 162 games , and it has been surpassed twice since then . ) Lemon was named Cleveland 's starter for game one of the 1954 World Series . After nine innings , the Indians and Giants were tied 2 – 2 . Lemon stayed in the game to pitch the tenth and final inning , but he surrendered a three @-@ run home run to pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes and the Indians lost , 5 – 2 . Indians manager Al López went with Lemon again in the fourth game after only two days rest . " He hasn 't worked that close together all year because we had a good bunch of other pitchers , but a year ago , he and Wynn and Garcia pitched every third day for practically a month . Bob will be all right " , Lopez said . Lemon and the Indians lost the game , 7 – 4 , as the Giants swept the Series four games to none . In his two appearances , he went 0 – 2 with a 6 @.@ 75 ERA , allowed eight walks and recorded 11 strikeouts . 
 Lemon began the 1955 season with a 5 – 0 record in April , but he was the only Cleveland starting pitcher with a winning record that month . His 18 wins tied for the most in the AL that year . He recorded five complete games through May 30 but none after that date . Indians general manager Hank Greenberg got Lemon to agree to his first reduction in contract salary since joining the organization . Lemon earned his 200th career win against the Baltimore Orioles on September 11 , 1956 , and he also hit a home run that day . He finished the season with a 20 – 14 record , the last of his seven career 20 @-@ win seasons , and led the AL in complete games ( 21 ) . On August 13 , 1957 , it was announced that Lemon would not finish the season due to continued irritation to his elbow after bone chips were found earlier in the season . Lemon ended the season with a record of 6 – 11 , his first losing record since 1946 . 
 In 1958 , Lemon was the oldest Indian on the roster at age 37 . Lemon pitched 3 @.@ 1 innings over the span of two games before he was put on the Indians ' disabled list and sent to the Triple @-@ A San Diego Padres . There he continued physical conditioning and mentored the pitching staff of the Indians ' top farm club . He appeared in 12 games with the Padres , going 2 – 5 , with a 4 @.@ 34 ERA , 22 walks , and 19 strikeouts . He returned to pitch for the Indians on May 25 in a relief role , but he appeared in only nine games that season . He earned just one decision that year , a loss , which brought his career pitching record to 207 – 128 . The club put him on waivers in July . 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 At 38 , Lemon went to Tucson in 1959 to attend Indians ' spring training camp . He told manager Joe Gordon that he was willing to become a relief pitcher , but he retired as a player on March 5 , stating , " I just couldn 't keep up with the young fellows anymore . " He accepted a scouting role with the Indians . 
 Lemon retired in 1958 with 207 wins , all but ten of them occurring in a ten @-@ year span . He recorded 274 hits in 1 @,@ 1883 at @-@ bats ( .232 ) , and his 37 career home runs are second on the all @-@ time career list for pitchers ( behind Wes Ferrell 's 38 ) . In 1951 , Ted Williams had written of Lemon : " I have to rate Lemon as one of the very best pitchers I ever faced . His ball was always moving , hard , sinking , fast @-@ breaking . You could never really <unk> with Lemon " . The Indians organization retired Lemon 's jersey number , 21 , in 1998 , making him the sixth Indian to receive the honor . 
 On January 22 , 1976 , Lemon was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers ' Association of America on the twelfth ballot on which he appeared . He received 75 percent of the vote . On August 8 , one day before his induction ceremony , Lemon said , " It 's a great thrill . My mother is 83 but she is making the trip from California . She says she can die happy now that I 've been elected to the Hall of Fame . " Lemon 's dominant slider has been cited as a key reason for his election to the Hall of Fame .

He was named the PCL 's Manager of the Year by The Sporting News for the 1966 season . He returned to the PCL as the manager for the Vancouver Mounties for one season in 1969 . Lemon said he used Indians manager Al López as a model for his managing style : 
 " Lopez always handled his players like I 'd want to be handled . He treated men like men . He made them feel relaxed . That 's the only way to play this game ... by being relaxed . You can 't be worried about the manager getting on you . All the time I was at Cleveland , I saw Lopez get mad only twice . He never showed anybody up . I don 't do it either . "

 Lemon became pitching coach of the Royals for the 1970 season , and got his first major league managing position when the Kansas City fired manager Charlie Metro on June 7 , 1970 . By August , Lemon received a one @-@ year contract extension with the club : 
 " I know many major league owners are against hiring a former pitcher as manager and I 've always wondered why . Pitching is 75 per cent of the game . If it 's so important , why not have a former pitcher as manager ? He can always have someone else run the other 25 per cent of the club . " 
 In 1971 , Lemon guided the Royals to their first winning season since the franchise began as an expansion team in 1969 . Lemon finished second in the Associated Press AL Manager of the Year voting . Before the 1972 season , Lemon talked about the team 's chances , saying " Five clubs could win it , including ourselves . " However , the Royals finished 76 – 78 in Lemon 's last year with the club . Royals owner Ewing Kauffman fired Lemon as manager and stated that he wanted a younger person to fill the position and " did not want to lose Jack McKeon " , who was named as Lemon 's replacement . Royals outfielder Lou Piniella was one of several players who disagreed with Kauffman 's decision , saying , " ... Lemon deserved to manage the club next year . " 
 His third and final stint in the PCL was with the Sacramento Solons in 1974 . His last minor league managerial position came the following season with the International League 's Richmond Braves .

 Bill Veeck hired Lemon to succeed Paul Richards as the Chicago White Sox manager on November 16 , 1976 . Lemon took over a Chicago team that finished in last place in the AL West in 1976 . " Bob is the type of manager we need at this stage of the game " , Veeck said . During spring training of 1977 , Lemon said , " I think we 'll surprise a few people . " White Sox shortstop Alan Bannister quickly noticed a difference . Comparing Richards to Lemon , Bannister said , " He 'd post the lineups 10 minutes before the game , and only then we 'd find out who was playing and where . Lemon 's made it a serious operation . " As late as August 14 , the White Sox were in first place in the AL West . The White Sox finished with a 90 – 72 record , a 26 @-@ game improvement . The team finished third in AL West and Lemon won his second Manager of the Year Award . " The fans got behind us after about three weeks . They had a lot to do with our success " , Lemon said after being winning the award . 
 Lemon was fired the following season on June 30 , 1978 , by Veeck after Chicago posted a 34 – 40 record in the first half of the 1978 season . He was replaced by former Indians ' teammate Larry Doby . " This change is not meant as any commentary on Lemon 's ability but rather was the result of unusual circumstances which seemed to make a change necessary " , said Veeck . 
 = = = = New York Yankees = = = = 
 Yankees manager Billy Martin resigned on July 24 , 1978 , and team president Al Rosen called Lemon to offer him the vacant position . He was announced as the new manager the next day . At their 1978 Old Timers Day five days after the Martin – Lemon changeover , the Yankees divulged that Lemon would be moved in 1980 to general manager , and they said that Martin would then return as field manager . The announcement was made by public @-@ address announcer Bob Sheppard after the Old Timers had been announced and it was accompanied by Martin 's dramatic entrance from the Yankee dugout . Martin received a long standing ovation from fans . Lemon responded to his new job — and to the newspaper strike that helped calm down the atmosphere in the Yankees clubhouse — by guiding the Yankees to the 1978 pennant . The Yankees , who trailed the Red Sox by 14 games at one point in July , pulled even with the Red Sox by defeating them in a four @-@ game September series known as the " Boston Massacre . " The Yankees pulled ahead by three and a half games , but the Red Sox rallied to tie the Yanks by the final day of the season . A one @-@ game playoff would determine the AL Eastern Division winner . 
 Ron Guidry was named the Yankees ' starting pitcher for the October 2 playoff game at Fenway Park . Guidry was able to pitch " because of Lemon 's good planning . " The Yankees defeated Boston for the division title in the tie @-@ breaker game , punctuated both by a dramatic three @-@ run home run by Bucky Dent in the seventh inning , and an eighth @-@ inning homer by Reggie Jackson that proved the game 's winning run . Lemon became the third manager in MLB history to replace another mid @-@ season and win the pennant . Lemon 's Yankees then beat the Royals in the ALCS and defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the World Series title . With the Series win , Lemon became the first AL manager and third MLB manager to take over a team mid @-@ season and win a World Series . Before the World Series , one columnist wrote , " ... many observers feel that Lemon 's low @-@ keyed approach with the Yankees ' temperamental millionaires as compared to the combativeness of Martin served to mold a spirit of togetherness among the Yankees that did not even exist last year when they won it all . " Lemon and his handling of the season was described in The New York Times as " an island of calm in a stormy summer . " Changes Lemon made during the season included returning Thurman Munson to the team 's every day catcher ( he had been playing in the outfield ) , putting Jackson in the clean @-@ up spot in the batting order and becoming the regular right fielder , and pitching Ed Figueroa every fourth day ( instead of fifth ) . In October , Lemon was named the Associated Press ' AL Manager of the Year , the second time he received such an award . 
 Lemon 's 26 @-@ year @-@ old son , Jerry , was killed in an automobile accident in the fall of 1978 , 10 days after Lemon won the World Series . The following season with the Yankees at 34 – 31 , Lemon was fired in June by Steinbrenner and replaced by Martin , but he remained with the organization as he had a contract through the 1982 season . Speaking of Martin , Lemon said , " He 's a very likeable guy , a free spirit . Where maybe I keep things inside , he lets them come out . There 's nothing wrong with that . " The Yankees finished in fourth place in the AL East ( 89 – 71 ) . Lemon worked as a scout for the Yankees and received " several offers " from other teams to serve as manager . One offer came in 1979 from the Indians , but Lemon refused it as well as the others .

 Steinbrenner named Lemon the team 's field manager a second time on September 6 , 1981 , the sixth Yankees ' manager change since 1978 .

Lemon survived just a few weeks into the 1982 season ( the Yankees were 6 – 8 ) before Steinbrenner dismissed him one last time , despite a promise for Steinbrenner he would manage the season " no matter what . " Of the agreement between Lemon and Steinbrenner , Steinbrenner said , " Lem and I talked . He said it was O.K. He said he didn 't take it as a promise anyway . " Gene Michael succeeded Lemon as manager . He had managed just over one full season of games ( 172 ) for the Yankees , winning 99 games for a .576 winning percentage .

 Lemon suffered a stroke in his later years . Lemon died in 2000 in Long Beach , California , where he had been a permanent resident since his career as a player .

He wasn 't overly fast , but he always stayed ahead of the hitters and he didn 't walk many batters , which is the key to success in the majors . " 
 = Nathaniel G. S. Hart = 
 Nathaniel Gray Smith Hart ( c . 1784 – January 23 , 1813 ) , often Nathaniel G. S. Hart , was a Lexington , Kentucky lawyer and businessman , who served with the state 's volunteer militia during the War of 1812 . As Captain of the Lexington Light Infantry from Kentucky , Hart and many of his men were killed in the River Raisin Massacre of January 23 , 1813 , after being taken prisoner the day before following the Battle of Frenchtown in Michigan Territory . 
 Hart was especially well @-@ connected politically and socially . In addition to reading law with Henry Clay , Hart 's wife Anna and Clay 's wife Lucretia were sisters . Hart 's wife Anna Edward Gist was the stepdaughter of Charles Scott , Governor of Kentucky and through her Hart was also a brother @-@ in @-@ law to James Brown , a future Ambassador to France and to James Pindell - a member of the Society of Cincinnati . Many other members of Hart 's Kentucky militia unit and its associated troops also came from the elite of Lexington and of the state . The men 's deaths in the two Battles of Frenchtown , but especially in the subsequent Massacre captured state and national attention . The phrase " Remember the Raisin ! " became an American call to arms for the duration of the War . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Nathaniel Hart was one of seven children , the second son of Colonel Thomas Hart , a veteran of the Revolutionary War , and his wife Susanna ( Gray ) Hart . 
 Originally from North Carolina , the family had moved to Hagerstown , Maryland , where Nathaniel was born . In 1794 they settled in Lexington , Kentucky as part of the postwar migration west . His father was a highly successful businessman , achieving wealth . Hart 's four sisters married men who achieved some renown : Ann married the future US Senator James Brown ( who subsequently served as Minister to France ) ; Eliza married the surgeon Dr. Richard Pindell ( a member of the Society of the Cincinnati ) ; Susanna married the lawyer Samuel Price , and Lucretia married Henry Clay , future US Senator and Secretary of State . 
 Hart attended Princeton College , where his classmates included William Elliott from western Ontario . Elliott 's father was a Loyalist who had resettled in Canada after the Revolutionary War . The two young men were close enough that Elliot stayed with Hart 's parents for a time to recover from a serious illness . 
 After Hart 's return to Lexington , he read law under Henry Clay , passed the bar , and set up a law practice in the city . Like his father , he became a successful businessman , a ropewalk ( hemp rope factory ) in the city being among his ventures . Hemp was a commodity crop of central Kentucky . In April 1809 , Hart married Anna Edward Gist , the stepdaughter of General Charles Scott , governor of Kentucky , and daughter of Judith Cary Gist Scott and her late husband General Nathaniel Gist . Hart and Anna had two sons , Thomas Hart Jr. and Henry Clay Hart . On January 7 , 1812 , Hart duelled with Samuel E. Watson at a location on the Indiana side of the Ohio River , near where Silver Creek emptied into the river . This was the site where Henry Clay had duelled with fellow state legislator Humphrey Marshall in 1809 . 
 = = Military service and death = = 
 At the start of the War of 1812 , Hart was commissioned as Captain of the Lexington Light Infantry Company ( aka " The Silk Stocking Boys " ) a volunteer unit of the Fayette County , Kentucky militia . He later served as either a Deputy Inspector or as Inspector General of William Henry Harrison 's Army of the Northwest . Hart 's command was attached to the Fifth Regiment of the Kentucky Volunteer Militia and left for the Northwest in August 1812 , where it became part of Army of the Northwest under General James Winchester . In January 1813 , a detachment was sent to the defense of Frenchtown , Michigan Territory as part of an effort to retake Detroit from the British . Frenchtown residents had sent word to the Americans asking for relief from an occupying force of the British and their Native American allies . 
 During the First Battle of Frenchtown on January 18 , 1813 , the American forces under Lt. Colonel William Lewis were successful in forcing the retreat of the small British force stationed there . The British commander of the Fort Malden garrison in Amherstburg , Colonel Henry Procter , made plans to take back Frenchtown and he ordered troops to the area . 
 On the morning of January 22 , 1813 , Procter 's forces , including hundreds of Native American warriors , attacked the American troops and overwhelmed the right flank of regulars under Winchester , forcing him and much of the general staff to surrender . The Kentucky militia under the command of Major George Madison on the left flank fought on and thought the flag of truce presented by the enemy was a British flag of surrender . During this second Battle of Frenchtown , 397 Americans were killed . Hart was wounded and was among the 547 survivors who surrendered to Procter upon orders of Winchester . Not many more than 30 Kentucky troops escaped death or capture . 
 William Elliott , Hart 's former Princeton classmate who had become a Captain in the British Army , promised the wounded man safe passage to Fort Malden , but did not carry out his pledge . Elliot borrowed a horse , bridle and saddle from Major Benjamin Franklin Graves , an American officer , promising to send help to the American wounded , but none arrived . Acting American captain William Caldwell wrote the next month that he heard Elliott tell General Winchester and Major Madison that " the Indians were very excellent surgeons ( and ought to kill all the officers and men ) . " In one official letter , the eye @-@ witness says that Elliott 's broken promise included an offer to take Hart in Elliott 's " own sleigh to Malden that evening " and that Hart could stay at Elliott 's home for his recovery . 
 Unable to march with the able @-@ bodied prisoners who were being directed to Fort Malden , Hart paid a friendly Indian to take him to the fort . Along the way they encountered other Native Americans , who shot and scalped Hart . Hart and an estimated 30 – 100 unarmed prisoners were killed by Native Americans on January 23 , the day after the battle , in what became known as the River Raisin Massacre . 
 The high fatalities of the Americans in the Battle of Frenchtown and the subsequent Massacre of prisoners became fuel for pro @-@ war political factions known as War Hawks , and for anti @-@ British sentiment of the era . The phrase " Remember the Raisin ! " entered the lexicon of the day as a flashpoint for popular sentiment , becoming a battle cry for American troops , especially the ones on the western frontier . The fact that many of the murdered men were well @-@ known and well @-@ connected members of Kentucky 's elite increased the public outcry . Among the dead was Colonel John Allen , Henry Clay 's law @-@ partner and co @-@ counsel in Aaron Burr 's conspiracy trial at Frankfort . Hart 's death is remembered in modern times as " The Murder of Captain Hart . " Major Benjamin Franklin Graves of Lexington was another officer apparently killed while a prisoner of the Potawatomi , who were overseeing him and others marching to Detroit . Many American prisoners disappeared or were killed while being force @-@ marched back to British @-@ held territory . 
 = = Aftermath of Hart 's death and memorials = = 
 Owing to their high casualties and status as prisoners , surviving Americans were not able to properly bury their fallen comrades . The remains of the American dead at this site were not interred until months later . In 1818 , the remains were transferred from Monroe , Michigan to Detroit . Isaac Baker , an American ensign who survived the Massacre and served as an official US Agent for the prisoners , stated in a report to General Winchester that : 
 The dead of our army are still denied the rites of <unk> . ... I was told the hogs were eating them . A gentleman told me he had seen them running about with skulls , arms , legs and other parts of the human system in their mouths . The French people on the Raisin buried Captains Hart , Woolfolk , and some others , but it was more than their lives were worth to have been caught paying this last <unk> tribute to mortality . " 
 In 1834 , the box containing the commingled American remains ( including tomahawked skulls ) , were moved from their former Detroit resting @-@ place and re @-@ interred in Detroit 's City Cemetery . These remains are asserted to have received final burial in the State Cemetery of Frankfort , Kentucky . As late as 1849 , a mass grave from the battle was excavated during road construction in Monroe , which developed in the area of the battlefield . Some writers state that those skeletons , along with the City Cemetery remains , were returned to Kentucky for final and proper burial that year . A 2004 archeological investigation at the State Monument found no evidence of remains from men of the River Raisin events . 
 Matthew Harris Jouett , a man who painted noted portraits of Thomas Jefferson , George Rogers Clark and Lafayette , was one of the Kentucky volunteers and among the survivors of the River Raisin Massacre . The company payroll of $ 6000 disappeared during the slaughter . Jouett restored the missing funds to the militia , based on his earnings as a painter . He also painted portraits of his fellow soldiers from memory , including Hart and Colonel Allen .

 In 1819 , the state of Kentucky named its 61st county as Hart County in Nathaniel Hart 's honor . 
 Hart was listed among officers on the Kentucky War Memorial in Frankfort Cemetery in the capital of Frankfort . 
 In 1904 residents of Monroe , Michigan , which includes much of the area of the battlefield , erected a monument to the Kentuckians who died defending their settlement during the various River Raisin engagements . Some unidentified victims were buried here . 
 In 2009 , the River Raisin National Battlefield Park was established , the only such park to commemorate the War of 1812 , and one of four battlefield parks in the nation . It had earlier been recognized as a state historic site and was previously listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

 " Ricardio the Heart Guy " was storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Cole Sanchez , from a story by Patrick McHale , Kent Osborne , and Pendleton Ward . It was directed by Larry Leichliter . Sugar , the eventual creator of the Cartoon Network series Steven Universe , began working on said program 's pilot episode while she was storyboarding this episode . 
 The episode features the recurring villain Ricardio , played by George Takei , a character that Tom Kenny later called " the valentine from Hell " . Takei later previously played the role in the season one episode " Ricardio the Heart Guy " . Sugar felt that Bubblegum , in the episode , was the victim of sexual harassment by Ricardio , and that the only way for her to solve the problem was for her to turn the situation around and somehow over come Ricardio . In the episode , this was metaphorically depicted by having Bubblegum best him in combat . Sugar reveled in the fact that she got to draw Bubblegum ripping off Ricardio 's leg and beating him with ; she noted that she had been wanting to featuring such a scene in her art since she was in high school . The climactic scene with Ricardio was also supposed to have featured more body imagery . Ricardio was originally slated to have been seated on a giant hand @-@ throne , and the hole in the Ice King 's chest was to have been more graphic . 
 The episode reveals that Lady Rainicorn is pregnant with Jake 's children . This plot point would later be brought to the forefront in the fifth season episode " Jake the Dad " . In the first draft of the ending , Lady Rainicorn was supposed to break up with Jake because he was causing her to be too stressed . However , the crew decided this was a bad idea , and it was changed to Rainicorn telling Jake that she is pregnant . It was originally planned for the pregnancy reveal to be in Korean , but the crew felt that the meaning of the ending would be lost on most of the audience . 
 Several video games inspired elements of the episode . Ricardio 's bioengineered body was based on the finale incarnation of Majora , a character from the eponymous 2000 video game The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask . The general look of Ricardio 's dungeon was inspired by the 2002 video games Eternal Darkness : Sanity 's Requiem and the 2010 game Amnesia : The Dark Descent . Robert Ryan Cory , a character designer most known for his work on the Nickelodeon series SpongeBob SquarePants , storyboarded the panels featuring Princess Bubblegum stomping on Ricardio and grinding her foot into his face . Because he drew the panels , lead character designer Andy Ristaino also allowed Cory to finalize the character designs for the scene . He later posted them on his official Flickr account .

 " Boys and Girls " is the fifteenth episode of the second season of the American comedy television series The Office , and the show 's twenty @-@ first episode overall . It was written by B. J. Novak and directed by Dennie Gordon and first aired on February 2 , 2006 on NBC . The episode guest stars Melora Hardin as Jan Levinson , Craig Robinson as Daryl Philbin , and Patrice O 'Neal as Lonny . 
 The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In this episode , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) becomes frustrated when he is not allowed to listen in on a " women in the workplace " seminar that Jan is conducting , so he conducts his own " men in the workplace " seminar in the warehouse , where talk of a warehouse union emerges . Meanwhile , Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) considers graphic design . 
 The genesis for the episode came from an idea cast members Angela Kinsey and Fischer had while spending time together on the set of the series . During the filming , Carell and the warehouse men were filmed on one set and Fischer and the office women filmed on another . The episode was viewed by 5 @.@ 42 million viewers , which was the lowest number since the first season finale " Hot Girl " . " Boys and Girls " received largely positive reviews from critics .

 Jan Levinson ( Melora Hardin ) leads the female Dunder Mifflin employees in a " women in the workplace " seminar . <unk> at being excluded , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) conducts a competing men in the workplace seminar in the warehouse . Roy approaches Jim under the belief that Jim used to like Pam . Darryl Philbin ( Craig Robinson ) and his equally irritated crew are forced to participate in Michael 's shenanigans , which culminates in Michael trying to drive a forklift , and knocking down several shelves . 
 Michael 's recklessness makes a complete mess of the warehouse while jeopardizing the employees ' safety . Michael 's plans to hold his own seminar backfire when the warehouse workers ' gripe session leads to them deciding to form a union . Jan intimidates them into reconsidering , citing a liquidation of the branch if it were to unionize . 
 Jan urges Pam to take a corporate training program in graphic design in New York when Pam reveals that she wants to be a graphic designer , but Roy squashes the idea . Jim rebukes Pam for listening to Roy when he is clearly wrong and acting selfish , which creates tension between them . Pam then tells the camera she is happy with her life now , and that they don 't even make her dream house in Scranton . She then breaks down and cries in front of the camera . As the day comes to a close , Michael leaves the warehouse in complete disarray .

 " Boys and Girls " was directed by Dennie Gordon ; it was written by B.J. Novak , who plays Ryan Howard on the show . The genesis for the episode came from cast members Angela Kinsey and Jenna Fischer . The two originally formulated an idea while spending time together on the set of The Office : " What if Jan came into the office and did a ' Women in the Workplace ' seminar , and Michael got all jealous ? " They presented their idea to executive producer Greg Daniels , who liked the idea . Daniels subsequently assigned the idea to Novak , who crafted the final episode . Pam 's monologue on reading about a girl who lived in a house with a terrace was based on a real book from the Choose Your Own Adventure series , although not specifically identified as such in the episode read by Jenna Fischer when she was a child . When the show 's cast and crew appeared at the Paley Center , Fischer related that Novak asked her if she had any personal stories that could relate to what Pam was feeling at the time the episode was being written . She then came up with the storybook idea , which was immediately written and filmed for the episode . 
 Fischer later called the episode " both the most masculine and most feminine episode of The Office yet " . This is largely because , during the filming , the different sections were shot separately : Carell and the warehouse filmed on one set and Fischer and the office women filmed on another . The women of The Office later said that " it was great " to spend time with themselves . Fischer later claimed that the woman spent a large part of the filming time talking and " <unk> [ ing ] like seventh @-@ graders . " 
 The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Michael asking Pam and Jim for help choosing a ringtone , Roy and Dwight talking about guns , Dwight shooting his <unk> gun , and Dwight agrees that " there 's no place like home . "

 Michael compares modern working women to Ally McBeal , the titular lead of the American legal comedy @-@ drama television series of the same name .

Michael Sciannamea of AOLTV called it " another brilliant episode " , noting that Carell was " at his obnoxious and comedic best " .

 = 1954 Guatemalan coup d 'état = 
 The 1954 Guatemalan coup d 'état was a covert operation carried out by the United States Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) that deposed the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz and ended the Guatemalan Revolution . Code @-@ named Operation PBSUCCESS , it installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas , the first in a series of U.S.-backed dictators who ruled Guatemala . 
 A popular revolution against the U.S.-backed dictator Jorge Ubico in 1944 had led to Guatemala 's first democratic election and the beginning of the Guatemalan Revolution . The elections were won by Juan José Arévalo who wanted to turn Guatemala into a liberal capitalist society . He implemented social reforms which included a minimum wage law , increased educational funding and near @-@ universal suffrage . Arévalo 's defense minister Jacobo Árbenz was elected President in 1950 , and continued the social reform policies , as well as instituting land reform , which sought to grant land to peasants who had been victims of debt slavery prior to Arévalo . Despite their moderate policies , the Guatemalan Revolution was widely disliked by the United States government , which was predisposed by the Cold War to see it as communist , and the United Fruit Company ( UFC ) , whose hugely profitable business had been affected by the end to brutal labor practices . The attitude of the U.S. government was also influenced by a propaganda campaign carried out by the UFC . 
 U.S. President Harry Truman authorized Operation PBFORTUNE to topple Árbenz in 1952 , with the support of Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza García , but the operation was aborted when too many details became public . Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected U.S. President in 1952 , promising to take a harder line against communism ; the close links that his staff members John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles had to the UFC also predisposed him to act against Árbenz . Subsequently declassified CIA documents stressed the importance of physically eliminating " Communists and collaborators " perceived as loyal to Árbenz . Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953 . The CIA armed , funded , and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas . The force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954 , backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare , including bombings of Guatemala City and an anti @-@ Árbenz radio station claiming to be genuine news . The invasion force fared poorly militarily , but the psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army , which refused to fight . Árbenz resigned on 27 June , and following negotiations in San Salvador , Carlos Castillo Armas became President on 7 July 1954 . 
 The coup was widely criticized internationally , and created lasting anti @-@ U.S. sentiment in Latin America . Castillo Armas quickly took dictatorial powers , banning all political parties , torturing and imprisoning political opponents , and reversing the social reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution . A series of U.S.-backed authoritarian governments ruled Guatemala until 1996 . The repression sparked off the Guatemalan Civil War between the government and leftist guerrillas , during which the military committed massive human rights violations against the civilian population , including a genocidal campaign against the Maya peoples . The coup has been described as the definitive deathblow to democracy in Guatemala . 
 = = Historical background = = 
 = = = Monroe Doctrine = = = 
 The Monroe Doctrine was a philosophy of foreign policy articulated by U.S. President James Monroe in 1823 . It warned the European powers not to indulge in further colonization in Latin America . The stated aim of the doctrine was to maintain order and stability , and to make certain that access to resources and markets was not limited . Historian Mark <unk> states that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language , which likened Latin American countries to fighting children . 
 The U.S. did not initially have the power to enforce the Monroe Doctrine . Over the course of the 19th century many European powers withdrew from Latin America , and the U.S. expanded its sphere of influence . In 1895 , Grover Cleveland laid out a more militant version of the doctrine , stating that the U.S. was " practically sovereign " on the continent . Following the Spanish – American War in 1898 , this aggressive interpretation was used to create a U.S. economic empire across the Caribbean , such as with the 1903 treaty with Cuba that was heavily tilted in the U.S. ' favor . U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt believed that the U.S. should be the main beneficiary of production in Central America . The U.S. enforced this hegemony with armed interventions in Nicaragua ( 1912 – 33 ) , and Haiti ( 1915 – 34 ) . The U.S. did not need to use its military might in Guatemala , where a series of dictators were willing to accommodate U.S. economic interests in return for U.S. support . From 1890 to 1920 , economic control of Guatemalan resources and economy shifted away from Britain and Germany to the United States , which became the dominant Guatemalan trade partner . The Monroe Doctrine continued to be applied to the country , and was used to justify the coup in 1954 . 
 = = = Authoritarian governments = = = 
 The surge in global coffee demand in the late 19th century led to the Guatemalan government making numerous concessions to plantation owners , such as by passing legislation that dispossessed the communal landholdings of the indigenous population and allowed coffee growers to purchase it . Manuel Estrada Cabrera , president of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920 , was one of several rulers who made huge concessions to foreign companies , including the United States @-@ based United Fruit Company ( UFC ) , which purchased large areas of land at favorable prices . U.S. historian William Blum describes UFC 's role in Guatemala as a " state within a state " : the company had a monopoly over the highly lucrative banana trade , and due to its close relationships with the Guatemalan dictators , also controlled the docks , the railroad , and the communications in the country . The U.S. government was also closely involved with the Guatemalan state , frequently dictating financial policies , and ensuring that U.S. companies were granted several exclusive rights . When Cabrera was overthrown in 1920 , the U.S. sent an armed force to make certain that the new president remained friendly to the United States . 
 Fearing a popular revolt following the unrest created by the Great Depression of 1929 , wealthy Guatemalan landowners lent their support to Jorge Ubico , who had become known for his efficiency and ruthlessness as a provincial governor . Ubico won an uncontested election in 1931 , with the United States also lending him heavy political support . Ubico 's regime quickly became one of the most repressive in the region . He abolished debt peonage , replacing it with a vagrancy law , which stipulated that all landless men of working age needed to perform a minimum of 100 days of forced labor annually . He authorized landowners to take any actions against their workers , including executions . Ubico was a big admirer of European fascists like Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler , but was driven to ally with the United States for geopolitical reasons . Following the American lead he declared war against Germany and Japan in 1941 , and arrested all people of German descent in the country . He continued to make massive concessions to the United Fruit Company , such as giving it 200 @,@ 000 hectares ( 490 @,@ 000 acres ) of public land , and exempting it from all taxes . 
 Ubico amassed a large personal wealth , claiming an annual salary equivalent to 215 @,@ 000 U.S. dollars . He was strongly anti – communist , reacting to several peasant rebellions with incarcerations and massacres . He held the indigenous Maya people in high contempt , likening them to donkeys . Ubico continued to receive support from the U.S. right through his period in power . 
 = = = Guatemalan Revolution and Presidency of Arévalo = = = 
 The repressive policies of the Ubico government resulted in a popular uprising led by university students and middle @-@ class citizens in 1944 . Ubico fled , handing over power to a three @-@ person junta led by Federico Ponce Vaides . The junta continued Ubico 's policies until it was toppled by the October Revolution . The movement had the aim of transforming Guatemala into a liberal capitalist society . The largely free election that followed installed a philosophically conservative university professor , Juan José Arévalo , as the President of Guatemala . Arévalo 's administration drafted a more liberal labor code , built health centers , and increased funding to education . It stopped short of drastically changing labor relations in the countryside . Arévalo enacted a minimum wage , and created state @-@ run farms to employ landless laborers . He also cracked down on the communist party , and in 1945 criminalized all unions in workplaces with less than 500 workers . By 1947 , the remaining unions had grown strong enough to pressure him into drafting a new labor code , which made workplace discrimination illegal and created health and safety standards , but Arévalo nonetheless refused to advocate land @-@ reform of any kind . Despite Arévalo 's anti @-@ communism , the United States was suspicious of him , and worried that he was under Soviet influence . Another cause for U.S. worry was Arévalo 's support of the Caribbean Legion , a group of progressive exiles , and revolutionaries who aimed to overthrow U.S. backed dictatorships across Central America , whose members included Fidel Castro . 
 The government also faced opposition from within the country . Although popular among Guatemalan nationalists , Arévalo was disliked by the Catholic church and the military , and faced at least 25 unsuccessful coup attempts during his presidency . A notable example was a coup attempt in 1949 led by Francisco Arana , one of the military leaders of the October 1944 coup . The attempt was foiled in an armed shootout between Arana 's supporters and a force led by Jacobo Árbenz , another leader of the 1944 coup , and had served as defense minister to Arévalo . Arana was among those killed , but details of the coup were never made public . Arévalo was prevented from contesting the 1950 elections by the constitution . The largely free elections were won by the popular . Árbenz promised to continue and expand the reforms begun under Arévalo . Despite having personal ties to some members of the communist Guatemalan Party of Labour which was legalized during his government , Árbenz did not try to turn Guatemala into a communist country , instead choosing a moderate capitalist approach . The communist movement did grow stronger during his presidency , partly due to Arévalo releasing its imprisoned leaders , and also through the strength of its teachers ' union . 
 = = = Presidency of Árbenz and land reform = = = 
 Under Árbenz , Guatemala constructed an Atlantic port and a highway to compete with United Fruit 's holdings , and built a hydro @-@ electric plant to offer cheaper energy than the US @-@ controlled electricity monopoly . Arbenz 's strategy was to limit the power of foreign companies through direct competition rather than through nationalization , except when it was impossible because a quantity was fixed , like land . 
 The biggest component of Árbenz ' policy was his agrarian reform bill . Árbenz drafted the bill himself , while also seeking advice from numerous economists from across Latin America . A strong influence on Árbenz ' policy was José Manuel Fortuny , a well @-@ known Guatemalan communist , who was one of his main advisers during his government . The focus of the program was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to their poverty stricken laborers , who would then be able to begin a viable farm of their own . Árbenz was also motivated to pass the bill because he needed to generate capital for his public infrastructure projects within the country . At the behest of the United States , the World Bank had refused to grant Guatemala a loan in 1951 , which made the shortage of capital more acute . 
 The official title of the agrarian reform bill was Decree 900 . It expropriated all uncultivated land from landholdings that were larger than 673 acres ( 272 ha ) . If the estates were between 672 acres ( 272 ha ) and 224 acres ( 91 ha ) in size , uncultivated land was expropriated only if less than two @-@ thirds of it was in use . The owners were compensated with government bonds , the value of which was equal to that of the land expropriated . The value of the land itself was the value that the owners had declared in their tax returns in 1952 . Of the nearly 350 @,@ 000 private land @-@ holdings , only 1710 were affected by expropriation . The law itself was cast in a moderate capitalist framework ; it was implemented with great speed , which resulted in occasional arbitrary land seizures . There was also some violence , directed at land @-@ owners , as well as at peasants that had minor landholdings . 
 By June 1954 , 1 @.@ 4 million acres of land had been expropriated and distributed . Approximately 500 @,@ 000 individuals , or one @-@ sixth of the population , had received land by this point . The decree also included provision of financial credit to the people who received the land . The National Agrarian Bank ( Banco Nacional Agrario , or BNA ) was created on 7 July 1953 . The BNA developed a reputation for being a highly efficient government bureaucracy . The loans had a high repayment rate ; of the 3 @,@ 371 @,@ 185 U.S. dollars paid out between March and November 1953 , 3 @,@ 049 @,@ 092 dollars had been repaid by June 1954 . The law also nationalized roads that passed through redistributed land , which greatly improved the connectivity of rural communities . 
 Contrary to the predictions made by detractors of the government , the law resulted in a slight increase in Guatemalan agricultural productivity , and to an increase in cultivated area . Purchases of farm machinery also increased . Overall , the law resulted in a significant improvement in living standards for many thousands of peasant families , the majority of whom were indigenous people . Historian Piero Gleijeses stated that the injustices corrected by the law were far greater than the injustice of the relatively few arbitrary land seizures . Historian Greg Grandin stated that the law was flawed in many respects ; among other things , it was too cautious and deferential to the planters , and it created communal divisions among peasants . Nonetheless , it represented a fundamental power shift in favor of those that had been marginalized before then .

 = = = History = = = 
 The United Fruit Company ( UFC ) had been formed in 1899 by the merger of two large American corporations . The new corporation held large tracts of land across Central America , and also controlled the railroads in the region , which it used to support its business of exporting bananas . By 1900 it had become the largest exporter of bananas in the world . By 1930 it had an operating capital of 215 million U.S. dollars , and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years . Under the dictatorships of Manuel Estrada Cabrera and Jorge Ubico , the company had been granted a large number of economic and legal concessions in Guatemala that allowed it to massively expand its business . These concessions frequently came at the cost of tax revenue for the Guatemalan government . The company supported Jorge Ubico in the leadership struggle that occurred from 1930 to 1932 , and upon assuming power , Ubico expressed willingness to create a new contract with it . This new contract was immensely favorable to the company . It included a 99 @-@ year lease to massive tracts of land , exemptions from virtually all taxes , and a guarantee that no other company would receive any competing contract . Under Ubico , the company paid virtually no taxes , which greatly hindered the Guatemalan government 's ability to deal with the Great Depression of 1929 – 32 . Ubico requested the UFC to cap the salary of its workers at only 50 cents a day , so that workers in other companies would be less able to demand higher wages . The company also virtually owned Puerto Barrios , Guatemala 's only port to the Atlantic Ocean , allowing the company to make profits from the flow of goods through the port . By 1950 , the company 's annual profits were 65 million U.S. dollars , twice as large as the revenue of the government of Guatemala .
