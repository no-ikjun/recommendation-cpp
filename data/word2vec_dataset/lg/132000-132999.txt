 The new fleet captured many more sloops , including one Low kept , naming it the Fortune . During a trial on 10 July 1723 for a number of Low 's crew , a sailor on board the Fortune named John Welland recalled how Low stripped his boat , including gold to the value of £ 150 , then beat him and cut off his ear with a cutlass . 
 Following this , Low 's fleet captured a Portuguese ship called the Nostra <unk> de Victoria on 25 January 1723 . The Victoria 's Portuguese captain allowed a bag containing approximately 11 @,@ 000 gold <unk> ( worth at the time around £ 15 @,@ 000 ) to fall into the sea rather than see it captured . One of Low 's most noted episodes of cruelty followed : in his rage , he slashed off the Portuguese captain 's lips with a cutlass , broiled them , and forced the victim to eat them while still hot . He then murdered the remaining crew . Low 's own men described him as " a maniac and a brute " . 
 A story describes Low burning a French cook alive , saying he was a " greasy fellow who would fry well " , and another tells he once killed 53 Spanish captives with his cutlass . Some historians , including David Cordingly , believe this was deliberately done to cultivate a ferocious image . Historian Edward Leslie described Low as a psychopath with a history filled with " mutilations , <unk> , decapitations , and slaughter " . 
 Low , like other pirates of the time , tried to intimidate his victims into surrendering , by threatening to kill or torture them . The crew of the targeted ship would hinder the officers from defending the ship , so afraid were they of reprisals . One failed torture session led to one of Low 's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth . <unk> surgery left Low scarred . 
 A snow called the Unity was added to the fleet , and used as a tender , but was abandoned during an encounter with a man of war named the Mermaid . As Low 's success increased in the Caribbean , so did his notoriety . Eventually , a bounty was placed on his head , and Low set out for the Azores , again teaming up with Charles Harris . As they terrorised the Azores , the pressure increased from the authorities , who by then had taken special notice of Edward Low , despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time . 
 = = = A defeat = = = 
 Low , Harris and their ships left the Azores for the Carolinas . On 10 June 1723 , they suffered a resounding defeat in a battle with HMS Greyhound , a heavily armed man of war . Greyhound had been dispatched under the command of Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet . Low fled in the Fancy with a skeleton crew and £ 150 @,@ 000 in gold on board and headed back to the Azores , leaving Harris and the Ranger behind . 
 Twenty @-@ five of the crew of the Ranger , including the ship 's doctor , were tried between 10 July and 12 July , with Solgard giving evidence and recounting the battle . The men were hanged for felony , piracy and robbery , near Newport , Rhode Island , on 19 July 1723 . Harris was sent back to England and hanged at Execution Dock in Wapping . When Solgard returned to New York , he was presented with the freedom of the city and a gold <unk> for his part in bringing some of Low 's crew to justice . 
 = = = End of Low 's career = = = 
 Low , still captaining the Fancy , sailed north . He captured a whaling vessel 80 miles ( 130 km ) out at sea , and in a foul mood following the encounter with the Greyhound and the loss of his right @-@ hand man , Harris , tortured the captain before shooting him through the head . He set the whaler 's crew adrift with no provisions , intending them to starve to death ( they were lucky , and reached Nantucket after a difficult journey ) . 
 Remaining off the coast of North America , his crew took a fishing boat near Block Island . Low decapitated the ship 's master , and sent the crew ashore . When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island , his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen . 
 Heading south again , Low captured a 22 @-@ gun French ship and a large Virginian merchant vessel , the Merry Christmas , in late June 1723 . Following the defeat by the Greyhound , Low became " peculiarly cruel " to his English victims . His fleet of three ships rejoined forces with George Lowther in July . In late 1723 , Low and Lowther 's fleet captured the Delight off the coast of Guinea , mounting fourteen guns on her , with command being given to Spriggs . Two days later , Spriggs and Lowther both abandoned Low , leaving him the Merry Christmas , by now mounted with 34 guns , as his sole ship . 
 = = = Fate = = = 
 There are conflicting reports on the circumstances of Edward Low 's death . Charles Johnson — considered by some to be Daniel Defoe writing under a pseudonym — stated in his A General History of the Pyrates , at odds with other sources , that Edward Low and the Fancy were last sighted near the Canaries and Guinea , but at the time of his 1724 book no further reports had surfaced . He noted one rumour that Low was sailing for Brazil and another that Low 's ship sank in a storm with the loss of all hands . The National Maritime Museum in London states that he was never caught , ending his days in Brazil . 
 The Pirates Own Book and Ossian both suggest that Low was set adrift without provisions by the crew of the Merry Christmas , in a mutiny brought about by Low 's murdering of a sleeping subordinate following an argument . Low was subsequently rescued by a French ship ; when the French authorities learned of his identity he was brought to trial , and was hanged in Martinique , in 1724 . 
 = = Flags = = 
 Initially , Low used the same flag as Edward Teach ( " Blackbeard " ) . Later , he used his own flag , a red skeletal figure on a black background , which became notorious . He first flew his own flag in late July 1723 . 
 Low also used a green silk flag with a yellow figure of a man blowing a trumpet ; this Green Trumpeter was hoisted on the mizzen peak to call his fleet 's captains to meetings aboard the flagship . 
 = = Articles = = 
 Low had a set of Articles , a code of conduct and an ironic reference to the Royal Navy 's own Articles of War . The Articles listed below are attributed to Low by the Boston News @-@ Letter . The first eight of these articles are essentially identical to those attributed to Lowther by Charles Johnson . 
 It is likely that both reports are correct and that Low and Lowther shared the same articles , with Low 's two extra articles being an <unk> , or amendment , adopted after the two crews separated . 
 I. The Captain is to have two full Shares ; the [ Quarter ] Master is to have one Share and one Half ; The Doctor , Mate , Gunner and Boatswain , one Share and one Quarter . 
 II . He that shall be found guilty of taking up any <unk> Weapon on Board the Privateer or any other prize by us taken , so as to Strike or Abuse one another in any regard , shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall see fit .

 = = Legacy = = 
 Edward Low 's acts , along with those of other pirates of the period such as Edward Teach , Bartholomew Roberts ( " Black Bart " ) , and William Fly , led to a great increase in the military presence to protect shipping lanes , resulting in the effective end of the Golden Age of Piracy . 
 By 1700 , the European states had enough troops and ships at their disposal , following the end of a number of wars , to begin better protecting their important colonies in the West Indies and in the Americas , without relying on the aid of privateers . Pirates based in the Caribbean were chased from the seas by a new British Royal Navy squadron based at Port Royal , Jamaica , and a smaller group of Spanish privateers , sailing from the Spanish Main , known as the Guarda de Costa ( Coast Guard in English ) , or simply the Guarda . 
 Less is recorded of Low than of other equally prolific pirates such as Teach and Stede Bonnet . Howard Pyle , in an 1880 children 's book on pirates , said : " No one stood higher in the trade than [ Low ] , and no one mounted to more lofty altitudes of bloodthirsty and unscrupulous wickedness . ' Tis strange that so little has been written and sung of this man of might , for he was as worthy of story and of song as was Blackbeard . " Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , in his work The Green Flag , described Low as " savage and desperate " , and a man of " amazing and grotesque brutality " . The New York Times said " Low and his crew became the terror of the Atlantic , and his depredations were committed on every part of the ocean , from the coast of Brazil to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland " . 
 Low has featured on stamps and commemorative currency around the Caribbean . A postage stamp featuring Low was commissioned by the Cayman Islands in 1975 , and in 1994 the government of Antigua and Barbuda featured Edward Low and his brigantine , Rebecca , on a legal tender one hundred @-@ dollar bill made of gold leaf . 
 " Ned Low " is one of the pirates featured on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at the Disneyland theme park in California . A duplicate of Low 's flag was used for the flag of the fictional pirate Sao Feng in Disney 's Pirates of the Caribbean films . Ned Low is played by Tadhg Murphy in the Starz TV series Black Sails . 
 Some of Low 's haunts , such as the waters around the Isles of Shoals off New Hampshire and Isle Haute in Nova Scotia , attract treasure hunters who seek artifacts in the ships he sank . 
 = Henry Rollins = 
 Henry Rollins ( born Henry Lawrence Garfield ; February 13 , 1961 ) is an American musician , actor , television and radio host , and comedian . He hosts a weekly radio show on KCRW , and is a regular columnist for LA Weekly and Rolling Stone Australia . 
 After performing for the short @-@ lived Washington , D.C. band State of Alert in 1980 , Rollins fronted the California hardcore punk band Black Flag from August 1981 until mid @-@ 1986 . Following the band 's breakup , Rollins established the record label and publishing company 2 @.@ 13 @.@ 61 to release his spoken word albums , and formed the Rollins Band , which toured with a number of lineups from 1987 until 2003 , and during 2006 . 
 Since Black Flag disbanded , Rollins has hosted numerous radio shows , such as Harmony in My Head on Indie 103 , and television shows such as The Henry Rollins Show , MTV 's 120 Minutes , and Jackass . He had recurring dramatic roles in the second season of Sons of Anarchy , in the final seasons of the animated series The Legend of Korra as Zaheer , and has also had roles in several films . Rollins has campaigned for various political causes in the United States , including promoting LGBT rights , World Hunger Relief , the West Memphis Three and an end to war in particular . 
 As of 2013 , Rollins is the host of the educational history television series 10 Things You Don 't Know About , joining the show for its second and third seasons . New episodes air weekly on H2 in the U.S. 
 = = Early life = = 
 Rollins was born in Washington , D.C. , the only child of Iris and Paul Garfield . When he was three years old , his parents divorced and he was raised by his mother in Glover Park , an affluent neighborhood of Washington . As a child and teenager , Rollins was sexually assaulted . He suffered from depression and low self @-@ esteem . In the fourth grade , he was diagnosed with hyperactivity and took Ritalin for several years so that he could focus during school . He attended The Bullis School , an all @-@ male preparatory school in Potomac , Maryland ( Bullis became co @-@ educational in 1981 after Rollins graduated ) . According to Rollins , the Bullis School helped him to develop a sense of discipline and a strong work ethic . It was at Bullis that he began writing . In 1987 , Rollins said he had not seen his father since he was 18 .

 = = = State of Alert = = = 
 After high school , Rollins attended American University in Washington D.C. for one semester , but dropped out in December 1979 . He began working minimum @-@ wage jobs , including a job as a courier for kidney samples at the National Institutes of Health . Rollins developed an interest in punk rock after he and his friend Ian MacKaye procured a copy of The Ramones 's eponymous debut album ; he later described it as a " akin to shooting heroin . " From 1979 to 1980 , Rollins was working as a roadie for Washington bands , including Teen Idles . When the band 's singer Nathan Strejcek failed to appear for practice sessions , Rollins convinced the Teen Idles to let him sing . Word of Rollins 's ability spread around the punk rock scene in Washington ; Bad Brains singer H.R. would sometimes get Rollins on stage to sing with him . 
 In 1980 , the Washington punk band the <unk> lost their frontman Lyle <unk> to Minor Threat . Rollins joined the rest of the band to form State of Alert ( S.O.A. ) , and became its frontman and vocalist . He put words to the band 's five songs and wrote several more . S.O.A. recorded their sole EP , No Policy , and released it in 1981 on MacKaye 's Dischord Records . S.O.A. disbanded after a total of a dozen concerts and one EP . Rollins had enjoyed being the band 's frontman , and had earned a reputation for fighting in shows . He later said , " I was like nineteen and a young man all full of steam and loved to get in the dust @-@ ups . " By this time , Rollins had become the manager of the Georgetown Häagen @-@ Dazs ice cream store ; his steady employment had helped to finance the S.O.A. EP . 
 = = = Black Flag = = = 
 In 1980 , a friend gave Rollins and MacKaye a copy of Black Flag 's Nervous Breakdown EP . Rollins soon became a fan of the band , exchanging letters with bassist Chuck Dukowski and later inviting the band to stay in his parents ' home when Black Flag toured the East Coast in December 1980 . When Black Flag returned to the East Coast in 1981 , Rollins attended as many of their concerts as he could . At an impromptu show in a New York bar , Black Flag 's vocalist Dez Cadena allowed Rollins to sing " <unk> In " , a song Rollins had asked the band to play in light of the fact that he had to drive back to Washington , D.C. to begin work . 
 Unbeknownst to Rollins , Cadena wanted to switch to guitar , and the band was looking for a new vocalist . The band was impressed with Rollins ' singing and stage demeanor , and the next day , after a semi @-@ formal audition at Tu Casa Studio in New York City , they asked him to become their permanent vocalist . Despite some doubts , he accepted , in part because of MacKaye 's encouragement . His high level of energy and intense personality suited the band 's style , but Rollins ' diverse tastes in music were a key factor in his being selected as singer ; Black Flag 's founder Greg Ginn was growing restless creatively and wanted a singer who was willing to move beyond simple , three @-@ chord punk . 
 After joining Black Flag in 1981 , Rollins quit his job at Häagen @-@ Dazs , sold his car , and moved to Los Angeles . Upon arriving in Los Angeles , Rollins got the Black Flag logo tattooed on his left biceps and also on the back of his neck , chose the stage name of Rollins , a surname he and MacKaye had used as teenagers . Rollins played his first show with Black Flag on August 21 , 1981 at Cuckoo 's Nest in Costa Mesa , California . Rollins was in a different environment in Los Angeles ; the police soon realized he was a member of Black Flag , and he was hassled as a result . Rollins later said : " That really scared me . It freaked me out that an adult would do that . [ ... ] My little eyes were opened big time . " 
 Before concerts , as the rest of the band tuned up , Rollins would stride about the stage dressed only in a pair of black shorts , grinding his teeth ; to focus before the show , he would squeeze a pool ball . His stage persona impressed several critics ; after a 1982 show in Anacortes , Washington , Sub Pop critic Calvin Johnson wrote : " Henry was incredible . Pacing back and forth , lunging , lurching , growling ; it was all real , the most intense emotional experiences I have ever seen . " 
 By 1983 , Rollins ' stage persona was increasingly alienating him from the rest of Black Flag . During a show in England , Rollins assaulted a member of the audience , who attacked Ginn ; Ginn later scolded Rollins , calling him a " macho asshole " . A legal dispute with Unicorn Records held up further Black Flag releases until 1984 , and Ginn was slowing the band 's tempo down so that they would remain innovative . In August 1983 , guitarist Dez Cadena had left the band ; a stalemate lingered between Dukowski and Ginn , who wanted Dukowski to leave , before Ginn fired Dukowski outright . 1984 's heavy metal music @-@ influenced My War featured Rollins screaming and wailing throughout many of the songs ; the band 's members also grew their hair to confuse the band 's hardcore punk audience . 
 Black Flag 's change in musical style and appearance alienated many of their original fans , who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth , stabbing him with pens , or scratching him with their nails , among other methods . He often fought back , dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them . During a Black Flag concert , Rollins punched a fan repeatedly in the face that had continuously reached for his microphone . Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience ; in his tour diary , Rollins wrote " When they spit at me , when they grab at me , they aren 't hurting me . When I push out and mangle the flesh of another , it 's falling so short of what I really want to do to them . " During the Unicorn legal dispute , Rollins had started a weight @-@ lifting program , and by their 1984 tours , he had become visibly well @-@ built ; journalist Michael Azerrad later commented that " his powerful physique was a metaphor for the impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself . " Rollins has since replied that " no , the training was just basically a way to push myself . " 
 = = = Rollins Band and solo releases = = = 
 Before Black Flag disbanded in August 1986 , Rollins had already toured as a solo spoken word artist . He released two solo records in 1987 , Hot Animal Machine , a collaboration with guitarist Chris Haskett , and Drive by Shooting , recorded as " Henrietta Collins and the <unk> <unk> " ; Rollins also released his second spoken word album , Big Ugly Mouth in the same year . Along with Haskett , Rollins soon added Andrew Weiss and Sim Cain , both former members of Ginn 's side @-@ project Gone , and called the new group Rollins Band . The band toured relentlessly , and their 1987 debut album , Life Time , was quickly followed by the outtakes and live collection Do It . The band continued to tour throughout 1988 ; in 1989 another Rollins Band album , Hard Volume was released . Another live album , Turned On , and another spoken word release , Live at McCabe 's , followed in 1990 . 
 In 1991 the Rollins Band signed a distribution deal with Imago Records and appeared at the Lollapalooza festival ; both improved the band 's presence . However , in December 1991 , Rollins and his best friend Joe Cole were accosted by two armed robbers outside Rollins 's home . Cole was murdered by a gunshot to the head , Rollins escaped without injury but police suspected him in the murder and detained him for ten hours . Although traumatized by Cole 's death , as chronicled in his book Now Watch Him Die , Rollins continued to release new material ; the spoken @-@ word album Human Butt appeared in 1992 on his own record label , 2 @.@ 13 @.@ 61 . The Rollins Band released The End of Silence , Rollins 's first charting album . 
 The following year , Rollins released a spoken @-@ word double album , The Boxed Life . The Rollins Band embarked upon the End of Silence tour ; bassist Weiss was fired towards its end and replaced by funk and jazz bassist Melvin Gibbs . According to critic Steve Huey , 1994 was Rollins 's " breakout year " . The Rollins Band appeared at Woodstock 94 and released Weight , which ranked on the Billboard Top 40 . Rollins released Get in the Van : On the Road with Black Flag , a double @-@ disc set of him reading from his Black Flag tour diary of the same name ; he won the Grammy for Best Spoken Word Recording as a result . Rollins was named 1994 's " Man of the Year " by the American men 's magazine Details and became a contributing columnist to the magazine . With the increased exposure , Rollins made several appearances on American music channels MTV and VH1 around this time , and made his Hollywood film debut in 1994 in The Chase playing a police officer . 
 In 1995 , the Rollins Band 's record label , Imago Records , declared itself bankrupt . Rollins began focusing on his spoken word career . He released Everything , a recording of a chapter of his book Eye Scream with free jazz backing , in 1996 . He continued to appear in various films , including Heat , Johnny Mnemonic and Lost Highway . The Rollins Band signed to Dreamworks Records in 1997 and soon released Come in and Burn , but it did not receive as much critical acclaim as their previous material . Rollins continued to release spoken @-@ word book readings , releasing Black Coffee Blues in the same year . In 1998 , Rollins released Think Tank , his first set of non @-@ book @-@ related spoken material in five years . 
 By 1998 , Rollins felt that the relationship with his backing band had run its course , and the line @-@ up disbanded . He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior , and invited them to form a new incarnation of the Rollins Band . Their first album , Get Some Go Again , was released two years later . The Rollins Band released several more albums , including 2001 's Nice and 2003 's Rise Above : 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three . After 2003 , the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work . During a 2006 appearance on Tom Green Live ! , Rollins stated that he " may never do music again " , a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to Trebuchet magazine . In an interview with Culture Brats , Henry admitted he had sworn off music for good – " ... and I must say that I miss it every day . I just don 't know honestly what I could do with it that 's different . " 
 In 2014 , Rollins admitted a disdain for rehashing old music for the sake of it - " I don ’ t want to play old music . To me , it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior . For me , I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again . If others want to , that ’ s for them . For myself , I have to move on . Life is too short to live in the past . There is a lot to be done . " On the same topic , Henry more recently said in 2016 " For me , music was a time and a place . I never really enjoyed being in a band . It was in me and it needed to come out , like a 25 @-@ year exorcism . One day , I woke up , and I didn ’ t have any more lyrics . I just had nothing to contribute to the form , and I was done with band practice and travelling in groups . " 
 = = = Musical style = = = 
 As a vocalist , Rollins has adopted a number of styles through the years . He was noted in the Washington , D.C. hardcore scene for what journalist Michael Azerrad described as a " compelling , raspy howl . " With State of Alert , Rollins " spat out the lyrics like a bellicose auctioneer . " He adopted a similar style after joining Black Flag in 1981 . By their album Damaged , however , Black Flag began to incorporate a swing beat into their style . Rollins then abandoned his State of Alert " bark " and adopted the band 's swing . Rollins later explained : " What I was doing kind of matched the vibe of the music . The music was intense and , well , I was as intense as you needed . " 
 In both incarnations of the Rollins Band , Rollins combined spoken word with his traditional vocal style in songs such as " Liar " ( the song begins with a one @-@ minute spoken diatribe by Rollins ) , barked his way through songs ( such as " Tearing " and " Starve " ) , and employed the loud @-@ quiet dynamic . Rolling Stone 's Anthony DeCurtis names Rollins a " screeching hate machine " and his " hallmark " as " the sheets @-@ of @-@ sound assault " . 
 With the Rollins Band , his lyrics focused " almost exclusively on issues relating to personal integrity , " according to critic Geoffrey Welchman .

 In the 1980s , Henry Rollins produced an album of acoustic songs for the famed convict Charles Manson titled Completion . The record was supposed to be released by SST Records , but the project was canceled because the label received death threats for working with Manson .

 Rollins and his best friend Joe Cole , son of actor Dennis Cole , were involved in a shooting when they were assaulted by robbers in December 1991 outside their shared Venice Beach , California , home . Cole died after being shot in the face , but Rollins escaped . The murder remains unsolved . 
 In an April 1992 Los Angeles Times interview , Rollins revealed he kept a plastic container full of soil soaked with the blood of Joe Cole . Rollins said " I dug up all the earth where his head fell — he was shot in the face — and I 've got all the dirt here , and so Joe Cole 's in the house . I say good morning to him every day . I got his phone , too , so I got a direct line to him . So that feels good . " 
 In a 2001 interview with Howard Stern , Rollins was asked about rumors that he had Joe Cole 's brain in his house . Rollins stated that he only has the soil from the spot Cole was killed . During the interview , Rollins also speculated that the reason they were targeted may have been because days prior to the incident , record producer Rick Rubin - who was a fan of Rollins Band - had requested to hear the then newly recorded album , The End of Silence , and turned up and parked outside their Venice Beach home in his Rolls @-@ Royce , carrying a cell phone . Because of the notoriety of the neighborhood , Rollins suspected that this would bring trouble because of the implication that they had a lot of money in the home ; he even wrote in his journal the night of Rubin 's visit : " My place is going to get popped " . 
 Rollins has included Cole 's story in his spoken word performances .

 = Mulder and Scully ( song ) = 
 " Mulder and Scully " is a song by Catatonia , released as a single from their 1998 album , International Velvet . The song makes direct reference to fictional FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , the two main characters of the popular sci @-@ fi TV series The X @-@ Files who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In an interview Cerys Matthews , co @-@ writer of the song , explained that while she was not a serious fan of the show , the basic premise of the series matched the conceit of what she was trying to express . 
 " Mulder and Scully " was released as the second single from the band 's album International Velvet . Originally , it was supposed to be the first single , but was delayed due to circumstances beyond the band 's control . The song was Catatonia 's first single in the United States . " Mulder and Scully " became the group 's break @-@ out hit and received a mixed to positive from the music press ; many critics felt that , musically , the song was well played , but that the track 's pop culture references were out of place . 
 A music video was released that featured the band performing the track while Mulder and Scully , played by look @-@ alikes , search the concert venue with torches . It was popular in both the United Kingdom and the United States . The song reached number three in the UK Singles Chart , making it Catatonia 's highest UK charting song . It also charted in Ireland , peaking at number 17 .

 The song makes direct reference to FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , the two main characters of the popular sci @-@ fi TV series The X @-@ Files who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Although the title and refrain reference the popular show , the song has little to do with the two characters . The use of Mulder and Scully are used to represent a metaphor for a relationship being so " strange " that it could be " a case for Mulder and Scully " , a reference to the paranormal cases — the titular X @-@ Files — the two investigate on the show . Cerys Matthews , the co @-@ writer of the song , explained that the conceit of the song was " about asking Mulder and Scully to figure out this thing called love . I like the idea of two people going round the planet investigating odd phenomena , in this case love " . 
 Matthews later admitted that she was not a serious fan of the show , but that she only used the line because it adequately described the type of relationship she was singing about . In an interview with the Daily Record , she explained , " I 'm not a big fan of [ The X @-@ Files ] but I got the line about things getting strange for Mulder and Scully from watching the odd episode " . After questioning , she later said that she would " prefer to go out for a night on the town with Gazza and Chris Evans than meet [ The X @-@ Files ] stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny " . Matthews also related that " I 'm sure loads of people bought the record by mistake , but who cares ? They should be flattered we wrote a song about [ The X @-@ Files ] anyway " . 
 = = Release and acclaim = = 
 The song was met with mixed to positive reviews from critics ; many reviewers lauded the band 's musical composition , but maligned the track for its heavy reliance on pop culture references . The Sunday Mirror wrote positively of the song and called it " hard rockin ' " . Ben Myers from the now @-@ defunct music magazine Melody Maker named the song the " Single of the Week " and called it " fantastic " . He noted that " they 've damn near written a perfect pop song . The first best single of the year " . Jerry Rubino , host of the popular radio show " Left of Center " , named the song one of his favorite " Brit Things " . A review from PopMatters noted that the song was built around " somewhat silly X @-@ Files references " , but that it possessed " hooks to die for " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine , from AllMusic gave the song a relatively positive review and singled it out as an " AllMusic Pick " . He also praised the song 's " terrific [ hook ] " but was slightly critical of the " self @-@ conscious pop culture references " . Despite this , he noted the band was successfully able to " bring memorable melodies to the [ song ] " . A subsequent review by AllMusic awarded the single , by itself , two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . NME called the song " little more than fodder for nostalgia TV " , written by a " lazy television researcher 's imagination " . 
 Cerys Matthews and the band were extremely pleased with the final product , calling it a " better song " than " All Around the World " by Oasis , the single 's main competitor at the time . Matthews later said that the lyrics for " Mulder and Scully " were " good , top to bottom " . Catatonia later released the song as part of their 2002 greatest hits album , And the song was later included on various Britpop compilations , including the Common People : The Britpop Story album , and the 100 Hits of the 90s album , released by the BBC .

 Originally , Catatonia wished to release " Mulder and Scully " during the summer of 1997 . However , due to complications , these plans were scrapped and the song " I Am the Mob " was released instead . " Mulder and Scully " was eventually released in January 1998 and , due to heavy promotion via BBC Radio 1 , soon became the band 's break @-@ out hit , propelling them " into the limelight [ … ] numerous interviews and television appearances " . The band 's record label , Blanco y Negro Records , promoted the single with a press release that described the song as " [ s ] <unk> but spiky " and a " clever grower of a track " . The song debuted on the United Kingdom chart on 31 January 1998 and made its last appearance on 4 April 1998 . During its first week of release , the single performed exceptionally well . Music stores reported that the physical release of " Mulder and Scully " was selling slightly fewer copies than Usher 's single " You Make Me Wanna ... " . Cerys Matthews later told Melody Maker that the single out @-@ sold Oasis " for two days " . During its first week , " Mulder and Scully " peaked on the chart at number three and spent a total of 10 weeks on the chart . The song also charted on the Irish Singles Chart , entering the charts on 2 May 1998 . It peaked at number 17 and spent five weeks charting . Later , a Japanese EP was released under the name " Mulder and Scully EP " . It combined tracks from the title single , as well as the " I Am the Mob " and " Road Rage " singles .

 The music video for " Mulder and Scully " was directed by Gerald McMorrow and features the band performing at a venue intercut with scenes of life on a tour bus at night .

Eventually , the agents begin passionately kissing while Catatonia plays their song on a stage . The video was filmed at T.J. ' s , a rock concert venue in Newport , Wales . A call was made for fans of the band to arrive and play the part of the audience . While actor Rhys Ifans , one year before his breakout performance in Notting Hill , features prominently . The entire video shoot took a full day to film . The video for " Mulder and Scully " was extremely popular ; according to Billboard magazine , the video for " Mulder and Scully " received " heavy rotation " and was played " 30 to 35 " times weekly in the United Kingdom . The video was heavily promoted in the United States , due in part to its direct allusion to The X @-@ Files , and it received decent airplay .

 Cynfarwy was a Christian in the 7th century about whom little is known . He was venerated by the early church in Wales as a saint , although he was never formally canonised . St Cynfarwy 's Church in Anglesey is dedicated to him , and his name is also preserved in the name of the settlement around the church , Llechgynfarwy ( or sometimes " <unk> " ) . His feast day is in November , although the date varies between sources . 
 = = Life and commemoration = = 
 Little is known for certain about Cynfarwy ; his dates of birth and death are not given in the <unk> y Saint ( a Welsh genealogical tract compiled in the late 18th century using material from older manuscripts ) . According to the 19th @-@ century Celtic scholar Robert Williams , Cynfarwy was active in the 7th century . According to the <unk> y Saint , he was the son of the otherwise unknown " <unk> ab <unk> , Lord of Cornwall " . 
 Cynfarwy is venerated as a saint , although he was never canonized by a pope : as the historian Jane Cartwright notes , " In Wales sanctity was locally conferred and none of the medieval Welsh saints appears to have been canonized by the Roman Catholic Church " . 
 = = Church and feast day = = 
 Cynfarwy is the patron saint of St Cynfarwy 's Church , Llechgynfarwy in Anglesey , north Wales . According to the 19th @-@ century Welsh historian Angharad Llwyd , he established the first church there in about 630 . The present church ( which is a Grade II listed building ) mainly dates from the 19th century , but has some medieval fabric and a 12th @-@ century font . 
 Until the 19th century , there was a stone more than 9 feet ( 3 m ) high in the field next to church , known Maen Llechgynfarwy ( maen meaning " stone " , <unk> meaning " slate " and " ‑ <unk> " being a modified form of the saint 's name ) . The settlement around the church , which is about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from the port of Holyhead , is known as Llechgynfarwy ( or sometimes as " <unk> " ) . 
 The traditional date for the feast of St Cynfarwy varies between antiquarian sources , although all place it in November . Some manuscripts say that it falls on the 10th , some on the 11th , whilst according to Angharad Llwyd and others the festival is marked on the 7th . 
 = Carl Michael Bellman = 
 Carl Michael Bellman ( listen ; 4 February 1740 – 11 February 1795 ) was a Swedish poet , songwriter , composer and performer . Bellman is a central figure in the Swedish song tradition and remains a powerful influence in Swedish music , as well as in Scandinavian literature , to this day . 
 Bellman is best known for two collections of poems set to music , Fredman 's songs ( Fredmans sånger ) and Fredman 's epistles ( Fredmans epistlar ) . Each consists of about 70 songs . The general theme is drinking , but the songs " most ingeniously " combine words and music to express feelings and moods ranging from humorous to elegiac , romantic to satirical . 
 Bellman 's patrons included the King , Gustav III of Sweden , who called him the master improviser . Bellman has been compared to Shakespeare , Beethoven , Mozart , and Hogarth , but his gift , using elegantly rococo classical references in comic contrast to sordid drinking and prostitution , which are at once regretted and celebrated in song , is unique . 
 Bellman 's songs continue to be performed and recorded by musicians from Scandinavia and in other languages including English , French , German , Italian and Russian . Several of his songs including <unk> Noak and Fjäriln vingad are known by heart by many Swedes . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Carl Michael Bellman was born on 4 February 1740 in the Stora Daurerska house , which was one of the finest in the Södermalm district of Stockholm . The house was the property of his maternal grandmother , Catharina von <unk> , who had brought up his father , orphaned as a small child . Carl Michael 's parents were Johan Arndt Bellman , a civil servant , and Catharina <unk> , daughter of the priest of the local Maria parish . Her family was wholly Swedish , whereas Johan 's family had German origins : they had come from Bremen in about 1660 . When Carl Michael was four the family moved to a smaller , single storey dwelling called the Lilla Daurerska house . He briefly went to a local school , but was educated mainly by private tutors . He was the eldest of 15 children who lived long enough for their births to be registered . His parents had intended him to become a priest , but he fell ill with a fever , and on recovering found he could express any thought in rhyming verse . His parents appointed a tutor called <unk> who Bellman called " a genius " . Bellman was taught French , German , Italian , English and Latin . He read Horace and Boileau ; <unk> taught him to write poetry and to translate French and German hymns . He was familiar with stories from the Bible including the Apocrypha , many of which found their way into the songs he composed in later life . However , expenses including the Swedish tradition of hospitality left the family with no money to start him off in life with a journey to the south of Europe , such as to Spain to visit his uncle , Jacob Martin Bellman , who was the Swedish Consul in Cádiz . Carl Michael translated a French book by Du Four and dedicated it to his uncle , but the hint was ignored . Deep in debt , at the end of 1757 the family sent Carl Michael to the State Bank as an unpaid trainee . He had no aptitude for numbers , instead discovering the taverns and brothels which were to figure so largely in his songs . 
 As the banking career was not working out – and as trainees were ( after a period with a relaxed regime ) again required to sit an exam , for which Bellman was ill equipped – he took a break in 1758 , going to the university of Uppsala , where Linnaeus was professor of botany . The idea of attending lectures was no more congenial than banking , and he stayed only one term ; one of his songs ( FS 28 ) records that " He contemplated Uppsala — the beer stung his mouth — love distracted his wits ... " However , he met young men ( such as Carl Bonde ) from wealthy and noble families , went drinking with them , and started to entertain them with his songs . Bellman returned to the bank job , and seems quickly to have fallen into financial difficulty : " a jungle of debts , sureties and bondsmen began to proliferate around him . " The character of bailiff Blomberg appears in his songs ( e.g. FS 14 ) , constantly trying to track down debtors and seize all their property . The law allowed the bankrupt only one way to escape from debtors ' prison : to leave Sweden . In 1763 , Bellman ran away to Norway . From the safety of Halden ( then called <unk> ) he writes to the Council applying first for a passport , and then for a safe @-@ conduct , both of which were granted . Meanwhile , his father had first mortgaged the Lilla Daurerska house , and then sold it : the family 's finances were no better than his own . Even worse , by April 1764 the Bank had become tired of the riotous behaviour of its young men : its investigations showed that Bellman had been the ringleader , leading them ( the Bank wrote ) into " gambling , masquerades , picnics and <unk> " . Bellman resigned , his safe banking career at an end . 
 = = = Poetry and song = = = 
 In 1765 , Bellman 's parents died ; deeply moved , he wrote a religious poem . Then his fortunes improved : someone found him a job , first in the Office of Manufactures , then in the Customs , and he was able once again to live happily in Stockholm , observing the people of the city , with at least a modest salary . In 1768 his life 's work as we now know it got under way : 
 Bellman had begun to compose an entirely new sort of song . A genre which ' had no model and can have no successors ' ( Kellgren ) , these songs were to grow swiftly in number until they made up the great work on which Bellman 's reputation as a poet chiefly rests . 
 Bellman mostly played the cittern , becoming the most famous player of this instrument in Sweden . His portrait by Per Krafft shows him playing an oval instrument with twelve strings , arranged as six pairs . His first songs were " parody songs " , a common form of entertainment at the time . 
 Between 1769 and 1773 , Bellman wrote 65 of 82 of his Epistles , as well as many poems . He attempted to publish the poems in 1772 , but was unable to obtain the permission of the king , Gustav III , as a political coup intervened . He finally managed to obtain the permission in 1774 , but soon discovered that the cost of printing , especially as he was determined to publish the sheet music alongside the text , was prohibitive given his ruinous finances , and he was forced to put off his plans . In 1776 the king gave him a sinecure job as secretary to the national lottery ; this supported him for the rest of his life . 
 On 19 December 1777 , at the age of 37 , he married the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Lovisa <unk> in Klara Church . They had four children , Gustav , Elis , Karl and Adolf ; Elis died young . Throughout his life , but especially during the 1770s , Bellman also wrote religious poetry , seeing no conflict with his bacchanalian works ; he published collections of his religious poems in 1781 and 1787 . He wrote some ten plays ( none with particularly strong plots ) as <unk> , some of them later serving as entertainments at the royal court . The plays fill Volume 6 of his collected works . In 1783 , Bellman brought out The Temple of Bacchus ( Bacchi Tempel ) , perhaps hoping to establish his reputation as a poet , rather than the merry entertainer that he was in fact known as at the time ; but he always stood out in people 's minds as unique , a different kind of writer and performer . 
 Bellman 's main works are the 65 Fredman 's songs ( Fredmans sånger , 1790 ) and the 82 Fredman 's epistles ( Fredmans epistlar , 1791 ) . Their themes include the pleasures of drunkenness and sex . Against this backdrop , Bellman deals with themes of love , death , and the transitoriness of life . The settings of his songs reflect life in 18th century Stockholm , but often refer to Greek and Roman mythological characters such as the goddess of love , Venus ( or her Swedish equivalent , Fröja ) , Neptune and his retinue of water @-@ nymphs , the love @-@ god Cupid , the ferryman Charon and Bacchus , the god of wine and pleasure . Many of Fredman 's Epistles are peopled by a cast which includes the clockmaker Jean Fredman , the prostitute or " nymph " Ulla Winblad , the alcoholic ex @-@ soldier Movitz , and Father Berg , a virtuoso on several instruments . Some of these were based on living models , others probably not . Ulla Winblad was widely believed to have been closely based on Maria Kristina <unk> , though the real woman , a silk worker once arrested for alleged prostitution , was not the ideal romantic figure of Bellman 's songs . Fredman 's songs also include Old Testament figures such as Noah and Judith . 
 Bellman achieved his effects of rococo elegance and humour through precisely organised incongruity . For example , Epistle 25 , " <unk> nu alla ! " ( All blow now ! ) , begins with Venus crossing the water , as in François Boucher <unk> of Venus , but when she disembarks , Bellman transforms her into a lustful Ulla Winblad . Similarly , the ornate and civilized minuet melody of " Ack du min Moder " ( Alas , thou my mother ) contrasts with the text : Fredman is lying with a hangover in the gutter outside a tavern , complaining bitterly about life . Ulla Winblad ( " <unk> " ) recurs through the Epistles ; Britten Austin comments that 
 Ulla is at once a nymph of the taverns and a goddess of a rococo universe of graceful and hot imaginings . 
 The songs are " most ingeniously " set to music , the melodies accentuated by the bold construction of music , word pictures and choice of words , while the music brings out a hidden dimension not seen if the words are simply read as verse . The poems themselves , far from being the brilliant improvisations that they appear , are striking in their " formal virtuosity " . They may be drinking songs in name , but in structure they are tightly woven into a precise metre , situating the " frenzied <unk> within a strict and decorous rococo frame . " 
 Bellman was a gifted entertainer and mimic . He was able to 
 go into a room apart and behind a half @-@ open door mimic twenty or thirty people at the same time , a crowd pushing its way on to one of the Djurgården ferries , perhaps , or the uproarious atmosphere of a seaman 's tavern . The illusion was so startling , his listeners could have sworn a mob of ' shoe @-@ <unk> , customs spies , seamen … <unk> , washerwomen … herring packers , tailors and bird @-@ catchers ' had burst into the next room . 
 In 1790 , the Swedish Academy awarded Bellman its annual <unk> prize of 50 <unk> for the most interesting piece of literature of the year . Although Fredman 's Epistles was neither exactly literature as understood by the academy , nor meeting the standards of elegant taste , Johan Henric Kellgren and the King ensured that Bellman won the prize . 
 = = = Later life = = = 
 After the assassination of the King at the Stockholm opera in 1792 , support for the liberal arts was withdrawn . Bellman , already in poor health from alcoholism , went into decline , drinking increasingly heavily . His drinking very likely contributed to his gout , which troubled him badly in 1790 . He also caught tuberculosis : the disease had already killed his mother , and by the winter of 1792 , he was seriously ill . 
 As well as being ill , he was imprisoned — after struggling with debts and haunted by the threat of ruin and imprisonment all his life — " for a wretched [ ly small ] debt of 150 <unk> " . The rumour was that a former Customs colleague , E. G. <unk> , had had his advances to Louise Bellman rejected , and in revenge had sued Bellman for the debt , knowing he was penniless : he owed a total of almost 4 @,@ 000 <unk> . On 11 February 1795 , he died in his sleep in his house in Gamla <unk> . He was buried in Klara churchyard with no gravestone , its location now unknown . The Swedish Academy belatedly placed a memorial in the churchyard in 1851 , complete with a bronze medallion by Johan Tobias Sergel . 
 = = Reception = = 
 King Gustav III called Bellman " Il signor <unk> " ( The master improviser ) . 
 Bellman has been compared with poets and musicians as diverse as Shakespeare and Beethoven . Åse Kleveland notes that he has been called " Swedish poetry 's Mozart , and Hogarth " , observing that 
 The comparison with Hogarth was no accident . Like the English portrait painter , Bellman drew detailed pictures of his time in his songs , not so much of life at court as of ordinary people 's everyday . 
 Paul Britten Austin says instead simply that : 
 Bellman is unique among great poets , I think , in that virtually his entire opus is conceived to music . Other poets , of course , notably our Elizabethans , have written songs . But song was only one branch of their art . They did not leave behind , as Bellman did , a great musical @-@ literary work nor paint in words and music a canvas of their age . Nor are their songs dramatic . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Bellman 's poetry continued to be read and sung throughout the nineteenth century , contrary to the widespread belief among researchers that he was largely forgotten during this period . His songs were sung especially by the urban bourgeoisie and in fraternities , but also in aristocratic circles and ordinary people in the countryside . The Orphei Drängar Vocal Society , named after a phrase in Epistle 14 , was founded in Uppsala in 1853 ; the song became their trademark . The Epistles and Songs were published in chapbooks , sung at festivals and performed in a variety of concerts and entertainments . Figures such as Fredman , Ulla Winblad and Movitz , as well as Bellman himself were painted on tavern walls and memorabilia such as plates , beer tankards and <unk> . Curiously , Bellman was celebrated at least as enthusiastically in polite and abstemious circles , though with bowdlerized versions of the songs . 
 Major interpreters of Bellman 's songs include the modern Swedish singer Fred Åkerström and the Dutch @-@ born Cornelis Vreeswijk . Other recordings have been made by Evert Taube and his son Sven @-@ Bertil Taube , and as rock music by Joakim <unk> , Candlemass or Marduk . They are also performed as choral music and as drinking songs . 
 Bellman has been translated into at least 20 languages , including English , most notably by Paul Britten Austin , and into German , for example by Hannes <unk> . German Communist leader Karl Liebknecht liked Bellman 's songs and translated some into German . Hans Christian Andersen was one of the first to translate Bellman into Danish . Bellman 's songs have been translated and recorded in Icelandic ( by <unk> ) , Italian , French , Finnish ( for instance by Vesa @-@ Matti Loiri ) , Russian , Chuvash and Yiddish . English interpretations have been recorded by William Clauson , Martin Best , Freddie <unk> made some Norwegian translations in 2008 . Sven @-@ Bertil Taube , Roger Hinchliffe and Martin Bagge . Schoolchildren two hundred years on still learn some of his songs , and several including <unk> Noak and Fjäriln vingad are known by heart by many Swedes . 
 Books in English with translations of Bellman 's work have been written by Charles Wharton Stork in 1917 , Hendrik Willem van Loon in 1939 , Paul Britten Austin in 1967 and 1990 , and the historian Michael Roberts in 1977 – 1991 . In English the most thorough treatment of Bellman 's life is also by Britten Austin . Van Loon 's The Last of the Troubadours : The Life and Music of Carl Michael Bellman ( 1740 – 1795 ) was inspired by a visit to Sweden , and tried to introduce the unknown Bellman to an American audience , but critics felt his version of twenty of the songs was " stiff and often ungraceful " , not doing justice to their composer . 
 Bellman was the subject of an 1844 ballet choreographed by August <unk> . Bellman features as a character , along with Ulla Winblad and King Gustav III , in the first episode of the Swedish television series " Nisse <unk> <unk> <unk> " ( Nisse Hult 's historical slips ) by SVT Drama . Bellman appears with his cittern and various objects from Fredman 's Epistles and Fredman 's Songs on a 100 Swedish kroner postage stamp issued in 2014 and designed by Beata <unk> ; he was shown on earlier Swedish stamps in 1940 and 1990 , commemorating the 200th and 250th anniversaries of his birth , and again in 2006 . <unk> in Stockholm 's Södermalm district is named for Bellman ; Stieg Larsson places the apartment of his Millennium trilogy hero Mikael Blomkvist in <unk> , which Dan Burstein and Arne de Keijzer suggest is meant to provide Bellman associations . 
 Swedish schoolchildren tell Bellman jokes about a person named Bellman , an antihero or modern @-@ day trickster with little or no connection to the poet . The first known Bellman joke is in a book from 1835 , which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman . 19th century Bellman jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman 's life at court ; they often related to sex . In the 20th century , the ' Bellman ' character became generic , the jokes were told by schoolchildren , and often related to bodily functions . The jokes have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s .

 Stora <unk> , also called the Bellman museum ( <unk> ) for its small permanent Bellman exhibition , celebrates his life and work with paintings , replica objects and a beachside café in a 17th @-@ century Stockholm house . The place , beside the beach at <unk> , was in Bellman 's time called Lilla <unk> ( The Small Lake @-@ Customs House ) where farmers from Lake Mälaren had to pay a toll on the goods they were taking to market in Stockholm 's Gamla stan .

 The Bellman Society ( <unk> ) , founded in Stockholm on the anniversary of Bellman 's birth in 1919 , fosters interest in Bellman and supports research into the man and his work . To these ends it organises concerts , lectures and excursions . It produces the series of <unk> , starting in 1924 , so far running to 24 volumes , as well as facsimile prints of Bellman documents , essay collections , and Yngve Berg 's Bellman porcelain . It has published recordings including Alla Fredmans Epistlar ( All Fredman 's Epistles ) and Alla Fredmans <unk> ( All Fredman 's Songs ) . The Society 's newsletter is called <unk> <unk> ? .

 = Lions ( album ) = 
 Lions is the sixth studio album by American rock band The Black Crowes . It was released in 2001 as their first album on V2 Records following their departure from Columbia , and is their only studio album to feature guitarist Audley Freed . Lions was recorded in New York City in January and February of that year , and was produced by Don Was . Bass guitar duties were shared by Rich Robinson and Was , as Greg Rzab had left the band and was not replaced until the tour that followed the release of the album . 
 The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at its peak position of 20 , selling more than 53 @,@ 000 copies in its first week . Lions received mixed reviews ; although the overall sound of the album generally garnered praise , a frequent complaint was the lack of " memorable " songs . The critics who rated Lions lowest considered it a poor imitation of the band 's influences , such as Led Zeppelin . 
 The band supported Lions with two North American tours ( one with Oasis co @-@ headlining ) , and a short tour of Europe and Japan in between . <unk> recordings of several concerts were available for download to those who owned the album . Following the tour , the band went on hiatus until 2005 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Black Crowes began writing songs for the follow @-@ up to their 1999 album By Your Side as free agents , having left Columbia Records through a loophole in their contract . The decision to leave was driven by Columbia 's promotion of By Your Side . According to band member Rich Robinson , " That record was destined to fail because ... [ Columbia executives ] just said , ' It 's not going to do well ... It 's no use wasting time or money . ' " The band also was frustrated by the label 's request for albums sounding similar to their first , 1990 's Shake Your Money Maker . 
 In late 1999 , lead vocalist Chris Robinson began a relationship with Kate Hudson , which would influence subtly the lyrics on Lions . The pair met at a Friday night party in Manhattan , which led to a Saturday stroll through Central Park and a Sunday move @-@ in . Their wedding at the Aspen , Colorado , ranch of Kurt Russell and Kate 's mother , Goldie Hawn , followed on December 31 , 2000 . 
 Before the 2000 tour with Jimmy Page , bassist Sven Pipien was fired after arriving late for a performance and missing the return flight . Rich said it was not enough to warrant termination , but Pipien 's defensiveness when confronted about the incident was too much to handle . Greg Rzab and Andy Hess were considered as replacements ; the band chose Rzab because he had more touring experience than Hess . Rzab , however , departed before the recording of Lions . 
 In mid @-@ 2000 , the band signed with Richard Branson 's V2 Records . Rich explained , " The cool thing about V2 , the reason that we chose them , is that they told us , ' You guys go make the record you want to make . Then give it to us and we 'll sell it . ' That 's what we needed to hear . " The freedom V2 afforded through its hands @-@ off approach influenced not only the music , but the album title as well . According to Chris , " Lions is a symbol that stands for the fierce feeling and freedom that music allows you . " 
 = = Writing and production = = 
 Chris Robinson granted that the experience of playing Led Zeppelin songs with Jimmy Page influenced Lions , but not on a song @-@ by @-@ song basis . " Led Zeppelin 's music is very dramatic and very dynamic . That 's something we 've attempted to do with our style also . I think it definitely affected how we make our music . " Funk and R & B were bigger influences than on past albums , and " Miracle to Me " was influenced by Nick Drake . 
 Chris claimed Kate Hudson 's influence on his lyrics was subtle : " More so than a literal reference to her , it 's the vantage point from where I 'm writing . It 's the reasons that I 'm singing and it 's the feeling . That is an influence far greater than the literal influence . " He did grant , however , that " Soul Singing " and " Miracle to Me " were written with Hudson in mind , and explained that the album 's track order roughly follows a path from confusion to clarity that mirrored his own . Producer Don Was said of Chris , " I realized he was taking on something that was significant . He was writing about becoming a man ... There 's a lot of old man / young man symbolism that 's a self @-@ conversation ... I don 't know that anyone has actually chronicled being 33 [ years old ] as well as this album . " 
 Heated discussions during the writing of Lions were rare , owing to the Robinson brothers ' usual method in which Rich writes the music and Chris writes the lyrics . " Soul Singing " was the only song to cause disagreement ; " I 'd written this part where although the vocals changed the music stayed the same throughout . I thought we should add something or just not finish it , but Chris thought it was already a song , and a good one . So we talked about that one for a while " , Rich recalled . 
 The Black Crowes had previously sent Was demos to interest him in producing By Your Side , but Was believed the demos were good enough to be the album . Columbia Records disagreed with Was ' assessment , however , leading to Kevin Shirley 's hiring . With complete artistic control under V2 Records , the band was free to hire Was for Lions . Recording took place in January and February 2001 at Montana Rehearsal Studios and Theater 99 Recording in New York City . The recording sessions progressed as smoothly as the writing ; only " Come On " caused conflict between the band and Was . Rich acknowledged , " We must have recorded ' Come On ' about five times in different ways ... Then [ Was ] just took it away with him and came back with this different mix " , which impressed the band , leading to its inclusion on the album . The band ultimately was satisfied by the recording experience , finding that Was was devoted to helping realize their vision for the album rather than imposing his own . 
 The sessions were recorded on tape and Pro @-@ Tools simultaneously ; the band ultimately chose to use the tape version , as they preferred its sound quality . Most songs were recorded live with the band members playing together in one room , and microphones set up to capture the overall sound rather than that of individual instruments . Was felt this approach best approximated the feel of a Black Crowes concert , later noting that the Lions songs debuted at a private show in February 2001 " sounded exactly like the record . " Most of the recordings that comprise the album were recorded during preproduction , the purpose of which was to test arrangements . " [ W ] e didn 't think we were recording the record . And it turned out to be great " said Rich . Audley Freed played guitar on only three tracks because Rich did not want " the meat of the song , which is the riff " , to get lost in a " wall of sound " . Though Rich brought his entire collection of guitars and a number of amplifiers , he mostly recorded with a 1954 Fender Esquire through a Harry Joyce amp . To achieve a resonator @-@ like tone on " Soul Singing " , he used a James <unk> metal @-@ bodied electric . Since Andy Hess did not join The Black Crowes until the above private show , the band did not have a bassist during the recording sessions ; Rich thus played bass on most tracks . On " Lay It All on Me " , however , Rich played piano , leaving the bass guitar duties to Don Was . 
 A total of twenty songs were recorded during the Lions sessions . Of the seven cut from the album , four were mixed and mastered for potential release ; three ( " Last Time Again " , " Love Is Now " and " <unk> " ) appeared as B @-@ sides , and the other ( " The Pretty Gurl Song " ) circulates on a bootleg recording . 
 = = Promotion and release = = 
 Soon after the Lions sessions , V2 Records threw a " completion party " at The Bank in New York City , at which The Black Crowes performed four songs from the new album , five songs from their catalog and a cover of Fleetwood Mac 's " Oh Well " . The band then played scattered dates in the U.S. and UK , including an appearance on Later ... with Jools Holland , ahead of Lions ' release . During this sequence of concerts , every song from the album was performed except " Losing My Mind " and " Ozone Mama " ; the remaining two would be played on the album @-@ supporting tour . 
 Lions was released on May 7 , 2001 , in the UK and a day later in the U.S. ; it subsequently debuted at its peak position of number 20 on the Billboard 200 chart , and sold over 53 @,@ 000 copies in its first week . As of January 2002 , the album had sold 192 @,@ 000 copies in the U.S. 
 Around the album 's release , band members made numerous promotional appearances . Chris Robinson guested on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart the day before the album was released in the U.S. , and Chris and Steve Gorman appeared on The Howard Stern Show the following day . The band performed " Soul Singing " on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on May 10 , and was inducted into Hollywood 's RockWalk four days later . A second late night television performance of " Soul Singing " took place on June 6 , this time on the Late Show with David Letterman . 
 " Lickin ' " was the first single from the album ; it peaked at number 9 on Billboard 's Mainstream Rock Tracks on May 19 . The song 's promotional video was a compilation of various takes of a static , low @-@ angle shot of the band performing the song on a tiny stage . Second single " Soul Singing " peaked at number 12 on the same chart on August 18 ; its promotional video featured the band playing in a grassy field as the sun rises in the sky . A third single , " Miracle to Me " , was canceled , but not before a promotional video was shot of the band ostensibly recording the song in a studio . Videos also were filmed for " Come On " , " Greasy Grass River " and " Cypress Tree " . Despite not playing on the album , Andy Hess appears in some of these videos , all of which are available as streaming media on the band 's official website . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Media reviews of Lions were mixed . Numerous writers detected a Led Zeppelin influence ( which was praised by some , but panned by others ) and attributed it to The Black Crowes ' recent tour with Jimmy Page . Dave McKenna , writing for The Washington Post , compared Steve Gorman 's drumming to that of John Bonham and found analogs to specific guitar and keyboard tones in Led Zeppelin albums . Nigel Williamson of The Times found similarities in Chris Robinson 's voice on " Come On " to that of Robert Plant , and wrote that the song " could almost be a Led Zeppelin II cast off . " Other reviewers noted similarities to Aerosmith ; Howard Cohen of The Miami Herald called " Lickin ' " " the best Aerosmith single that band hasn 't recorded in years . " The perceived lack of originality , though , turned off some critics . The Herald Sun 's Andrew <unk> inferred " The Black Crowes are unaware it 's no longer the ' 70s and after one listen to Lions ... it 's clear someone should tell them . " Everett True of Playlouder concurred , writing " It 's blindingly obvious the Crowes are imitators , and always will be " , though Elysa Gardner , writing for USA Today , recognized the band " exhibit an energy and dexterity that compensate — at least somewhat — for their lack of invention . " 
 Many reviewers praised the sound of Lions but felt the songs were weak . Writing for <unk> , John Mulvey highlighted the " gutsy , no @-@ messing sound " , but appreciated " Cosmic Friend " for being " as impressively mad as you 'd hope , too , beginning like Beatles psychedelia , taking in massive Brazilian drumming and a touch of pedal steel , before coalescing into furious heavy rock . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described Lions as a " powerful , textured hard rock record that covers a lot of ground , surging from powerful riffs to gospel choruses and funkier @-@ than @-@ expected riffs " , though he also complained that " the songs can seem incomplete . " Critics disagreed on which songs were lacking , though . " Losing My Mind " and " Young Man , Old Man " were called " highlights " by Jane Stevenson of the Toronto Sun , though elsewhere the former was called " woeful " and the latter a " ' Freddie 's Dead ' vamp " that should have been skipped . 
 The lyrics of Lions were another target for the critics . Mark Beaumont of NME stated that the eloquence ends at the " Come awn come awn ! / Everyone ! " chorus of " Come On " , and Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club bemoaned that " hoary tropes abound " . 
 = = Concert tours = = 
 Shortly after the release of Lions , The Black Crowes and Oasis , with opening band Spacehog , embarked on a co @-@ headlining tour of North American theaters and amphitheaters . The Black Crowes had previously met Liam and Noel Gallagher and hit it off ; " ... so we called them and asked them if they were interested [ in touring together ] . And so they were like , ' Yeah , we 'd love to ! ' " said Rich . The Black Crowes performed last each night , and their seventy @-@ five @-@ minute set always included numerous songs from Lions . Members of Oasis typically would join them for an encore cover such as " Lucifer Sam " , " Can 't You Hear Me Knocking " or " Road Runner " . 
 The Black Crowes followed the tour with one @-@ off dates and festivals across Europe and Japan , including shows opening for Neil Young . Most of these shows , as well as most of the dates with Oasis , were made available by V2 Records as soundboard recordings . With Lions loaded in a CD @-@ ROM drive , one could stream each show , as well as download one live track per week and one show in its entirety . 
 Following a month @-@ long break , the group returned to the road in late August for their Listen Massive Tour , with Beachwood Sparks as the opening band . The tour was billed as a return to two @-@ hour shows featuring a rotating set list . The September 11 show at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles was canceled , but the band performed the next evening in Tucson , Arizona , as scheduled . All profits and merchandise sales from the following week 's three shows at the Beacon Theatre in New York City were donated to the New York State World Trade Center Relief Fund and the New York City Public / Private Initiative . While in New York City , Chris and Rich performed " By Your Side " on Late Night with Conan O 'Brien . The Listen Massive Tour concluded with a 140 @-@ minute show at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston , Massachusetts , on October 31 . This would be Andy Hess and Audley Freed 's last show as band members , as The Black Crowes went on hiatus shortly thereafter .

 = Above All State Park = 
 Above All State Park is an undeveloped Connecticut state park located in the town of Warren . Founded in 1927 , the park became the site of a military radar installation from 1957 to 1968 . Remnants of the Cold War defense installation may be seen . The park 's only amenities are unmarked , informal trails that are not maintained by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection . 
 = = History = = 
 In his book on Connecticut 's state parks , author Joseph Leary traces the name to when the land was used by the Stone family , who claimed it was the highest working farm by elevation in all of Connecticut . During the 19th century , the site was considered for the " Above @-@ All Mountain House , " a holiday resort that was never built . Leary writes that despite its name , the park is not " above all " in terms of scale , views or elevation and cites the scale of Lake <unk> State Park , the views of Mount Tom State Park , and the elevation of Dennis Hill State Park . According to Connecticut : A Guide to Its Roads , Lore , and People , the park 's name came from its " top of the world " isolation . 
 The park was founded in 1927 when the heirs of Seymour Strong gifted three acres of land to the state . The State of Connecticut decided to purchase 28 additional acres from the Stanley estate in December 1927 . Above All State Park was the 36th state park to be designated . From June 1957 to June 1968 , the state park became a military installation known as the New Preston Gap @-@ Filler RADAR Annex P @-@ 50A / Z @-@ 50A . In 1968 , a dirt road and cinder block building , a bunker , were added to the top of the hill as part of an upgrade to the site . Located behind the bunker was the launchpad for the Nike missiles , each carrying a 2 @-@ to @-@ 40 kiloton nuclear warhead . The site also functioned as the command and control center , but Bedell states that it was the command center for the twelve Nike sites across Connecticut . However , the site is also described as an unmanned gap @-@ filler that " providing low altitude coverage " that " consisted of the radar and tower along with the building which contained the radar equipment and a diesel generator . " Bedell states that the park reappeared on the maps after its decommissioning , but has since reverted to secrecy . This claim of secrecy is countered by it being listed on the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection website . 
 In 1981 , the park was the subject of a study by Northeast Utilities as a possible wind power site . An anemometer and wind vane were placed atop a 65 @-@ foot ( 20 m ) tower to record wind data for no less than one year . 
 = = Status = = 
 The Above All State Park is managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection , but it is unmarked and undeveloped . The location of the military site is the subject of debate because the website <unk> states that the site is " not within a state park as earlier reported , " but proceeds to give the same directions and description as Leary and Bedell . Photos included on the <unk> website show the condition of the site in 2001 and 2006 : both show the buildings are extant in " excellent condition , " but the site says the radar tower and chain @-@ link fencing are missing . The site has been vandalized by graffiti . 
 The park is accessed off Connecticut Route 341 and requires passing a barred gate . There are no markers , toilets , or other facilities at the Above All State Park ; there are some informal trails near the top of the park that are not maintained or marked by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection .

 After a two @-@ year career with the Penticton Panthers , in which he was named Canadian Junior A Player of the Year in 1992 , Kariya joined the college ranks with the University of Maine 's Black Bears men 's ice hockey team . In his freshman year , he received the Hobey Baker Award while leading his team to the 1993 NCAA title . Selected fourth overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft by the Mighty Ducks , he joined the team in 1994 – 95 and was named to the NHL All @-@ Rookie Team . During his nine @-@ year tenure with Anaheim , Kariya formed an effective duo with fellow winger Teemu Selänne that helped him to three NHL First All @-@ Star Team distinctions , while also finishing as the first runner @-@ up for the Hart Memorial Trophy in 1997 . Not an aggressive player , he won back @-@ to @-@ back Lady Byng Trophies in 1996 and 1997 as the League 's most gentlemanly player . Serving as a captain for seven seasons , he led the Mighty Ducks to the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals , where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in seven games . After a single @-@ season stint with the Avalanche for the purpose of reuniting with Selänne , who had previously been traded away from Anaheim , Kariya signed with the Predators in August 2005 . He played two seasons in Nashville , setting team records for assists and points scored in a single @-@ season in 2005 – 06 . Kariya then finished his career playing three seasons with the Blues . 
 Internationally , Kariya represented Canada on numerous stages and at different levels . He won gold at the 1993 World Junior Championships , his second appearance at the tournament . He made his first appearance at the Winter Olympics in 1994 as an amateur , winning silver . Eight years later , he helped Canada win gold at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City . In between Olympic appearances , he won gold and silver at the 1994 and 1996 World Championships , respectively . 
 Throughout his NHL career , Kariya struggled with concussions , which eventually forced his retirement in June 2011 after sitting out the 2010 – 11 season because of post @-@ concussion syndrome . Psychiatrist Daniel Amen provided diagnosis and therapy for Kariya , advising him to retire as a professional , which he did .

 Kariya played two seasons of Junior A with the Penticton Panthers of the British Columbia Junior Hockey League ( BCJHL ) , beginning in 1990 – 91 . Recording 45 goals and 112 points over 54 games in his first season , he was awarded the Vern Dye and Bruce Allison Memorial Trophies as the Interior Conference 's most valuable player ( MVP ) and rookie of the year , respectively . The following season , he improved to 46 goals and 132 points over 40 games and was awarded the Vern Dye Memorial Trophy for a second consecutive year ; he was also further distinguished as the Canadian Junior A Player of the Year . 
 During his second BCJHL season , in November 1991 , he verbally committed to joining the Maine Black Bears of the National Collegiate Athletics Association ( NCAA ) ' s Hockey East conference for the 1992 – 93 campaign . Before deciding to join the University of Maine , Kariya was also accepted and had visited Boston University and Harvard University for their respective programs , while entertaining offers from several other NCAA teams . He also turned down major junior teams from the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) . His WHL rights originally belonged to the Victoria Cougars before they were traded to the Tri @-@ City Americans in October 1991 . 
 In his first year with the Black Bears , Kariya scored 100 points ( 25 goals and 75 assists ) in 39 games . He was named Hockey East 's Rookie and Player of the Year , becoming the second player to receive both awards in the same year after Brian Leetch did so with Boston College in 1987 . Kariya also received Hockey East First All @-@ Star Team honours alongside teammates Jim Montgomery , Chris Imes and Mike Dunham . Nationally , Kariya was recognized with the Hobey Baker Award as the NCAA 's top player , becoming the first freshman in history to earn the distinction . During the Black Bears ' playoff run , Head Coach Shawn Walsh heralded him as one of the top three college players all @-@ time . Kariya 's efforts led Maine to a record of 42 wins , one loss and two ties , en route to the Lamoriello Trophy as the Hockey East 's playoff champion and the NCAA title as the country 's top college team . Facing Lake Superior State University in the NCAA final , Kariya registered three assists in the third period to help Maine overcome a two @-@ goal deficit ; they won the game 5 – 4 . 
 A top prospect heading into the off @-@ season , Kariya was projected to be selected between second and fifth overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft . Kariya went on to be chosen fourth overall by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim , one of the League 's two expansion teams . In addition to becoming Anaheim 's first @-@ ever draft pick , he also became the second @-@ highest pick from Vancouver ( after Barry Beck was chosen by the Colorado Rockies second overall in 1977 ) . Following his draft , Kariya returned to the University of Maine for his sophomore year as team captain . He had been voted by his teammates for the role , along with defenceman Chris Imes . With Imes joining the United States ' national team full @-@ time in 1993 – 94 , however , Kariya returned as the lone captain . Kariya was also committed to the Canadian national team in preparation for the 1994 Winter Olympics and left the Black Bears in December 1993 . Following the Olympics , Kariya chose not to return to Maine , foregoing his remaining college hockey eligibility to turn professional with the Mighty Ducks . He finished the season with seven goals and 41 points over 23 games with the national team , as well as eight goals and 24 points over 12 games with Maine . 
 Five years after his tenure with the Black Bears , Kariya was selected for induction into the University of Maine Sports Hall of Fame . The ceremony was held on October 15 , 1999 , at Wells Conference Center on the University 's Orono campus . Two years later , in July 2001 , Kariya 's number 9 was retired by the Black Bears .

 Upon returning from the 1994 Olympics , Kariya began contract negotiations with the Mighty Ducks in hopes of joining the team for the remainder of the 1993 – 94 NHL season . However , a deal failed to materialize and there was speculation in the media that he would instead play in Europe . It was reported that Kariya was seeking a US $ 12 million contract over five years from the Ducks . As both sides continued contract talks leading up to training camp for the 1994 – 95 season , Kariya agreed to a three @-@ year , $ 6 @.@ 5 million deal on August 31 , 1994 . The majority of the contract consisted of a signing bonus worth $ 4 @.@ 775 million , while the annual base salary was valued at $ 575 @,@ 000 . Clarification regarding Kariya 's free agency status had he not signed was required from the League before the contract was agreed upon ; it was ruled that he would have become a free agent on June 1 , 1995 , had the Mighty Ducks not signed him by then . 
 Garnering a great degree of attention from the Mighty Ducks ' fanbase , Kariya 's first public practice at Arrowhead Pond drew an attendance of 9 @,@ 000 , while 16 @,@ 000 fans watched his first exhibition game . Due to the NHL lockout , resulting from a dispute between players and owners , his regular season debut was delayed until January 1995 and the campaign was shortened to 48 games . During the suspension , Kariya participated in a charity tournament held in Hamilton , Ontario , sponsored by the National Hockey League Players ' Association ( NHLPA ) . 
 As NHL play resumed , Kariya made his debut against the Edmonton Oilers . He later scored his first career NHL goal on January 21 , 1995 , against Winnipeg Jets goaltender Tim <unk> . The goal came after a scramble around the crease knocked the puck loose in front of the net on a power play ; Anaheim won the game 4 – 3 . During his rookie season , he played on a line with Stéphan <unk> and Shaun Van Allen . Early in the campaign , Kariya held the scoring lead amongst League rookies , but was later overtaken by Quebec Nordiques centre Peter Forsberg . Playing in 47 games , Kariya finished the season with a team @-@ leading 18 goals and 39 points . As a team , however , the Mighty Ducks struggled in their second year since joining the NHL , finishing last in the Western Conference . Nominated for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the League 's rookie of the year , Kariya lost the award to Forsberg . Despite being edged out , Kariya was named to the NHL All @-@ Rookie Team . His play during his first NHL season earned him comparisons to Wayne Gretzky for his vision and Pavel Bure for his speed , while also earning accolades from Gretzky himself . 
 During Kariya 's second season , he was chosen to play for the Western Conference in the 1996 All @-@ Star Game as the lone Ducks representative . At the time of his selection , in January 1996 , he was ranked 14th in League scoring with 51 points ( 23 goals and 28 assists ) over 42 games . He later replaced the injured Pavel Bure of the Vancouver Canucks on the West 's starting lineup . Kariya scored a goal and an assist for the Western Conference in a 5 – 4 loss to the Eastern Conference . Less than a month after the All @-@ Star Game , the Mighty Ducks acquired Finnish winger Teemu Selänne in a trade with the Winnipeg Jets . Despite Kariya 's efforts , the Ducks were low @-@ scoring as a team ; the deal was designed to give Kariya offensive support . Following the trade , Ducks centre Steve Rucchin commented , " Paul had a lot of pressure on him ... He singlehandedly won some games for us this year ... Now that we have Teemu , there 's no way everybody can just key on Paul . " Selänne was immediately placed on Kariya 's line ; centred by Rucchin , the two wingers formed one of the League 's most high @-@ scoring duos for several seasons . In the last month of the 1995 – 96 campaign , Kariya achieved the 100 @-@ point single @-@ season mark with a goal and three assists in a 5 – 3 win against the San Jose Sharks on April 7 , 1996 . A week later , he became the 14th @-@ youngest NHL player to register 50 goals in one season , scoring twice in the final game of the campaign , a 5 – 2 win over Winnipeg . With seven goals and seven assists over the final seven games of the season , Kariya was named NHL Player of the Month for April . He finished the season with 50 goals and 58 assists for 108 points , tying him with Selänne for seventh overall in NHL scoring . His three overtime goals set a team record . With 20 penalty minutes over 82 games , Kariya won the Lady Byng Trophy as the League 's most gentlemanly player and was also named to the season @-@ ending NHL First All @-@ Star Team . Following the addition of Selänne , the Mighty Ducks pushed for a playoff spot , winning 12 of their final 15 games , but finished the season ninth place in the West ( the top eight teams qualify for the playoffs ) ; they had an equal 78 points to the eighth @-@ ranked Jets , but finished a spot below them by virtue of having fewer wins . 
 Following the 1995 – 96 season , Ducks captain Randy Ladouceur retired , leaving the team 's leadership position vacant . After serving as an alternate captain the previous year , Kariya was chosen as the third captain in team history , following <unk> and Troy Loney . At 21 years old , he was the youngest active captain in the NHL and remained so until defenceman Bryan McCabe became captain of the New York Islanders two years later . Also during the off @-@ season , there was speculation that the Mighty Ducks would acquire Wayne Gretzky , whose contract had expired with the St. Louis Blues . Gretzky 's agent had publicly declared that the All @-@ Star centre had interest in joining the Ducks , particularly to play with Kariya and Selänne , though the team had not contacted him with an offer . Instead , the Ducks signed 36 @-@ year @-@ old centre Jari Kurri from the New York Rangers . Following the signing , Ducks Head Coach Ron Wilson commented that " A veteran player is much better prepared to play with guys like Teemu and Paul . " ( Though Kariya began the season centred by Kurri , the Finnish veteran did not often play on the top line in his lone season with the team . ) 
 As the ensuing 1996 – 97 season began , Kariya was out of the lineup with a pulled abdominal muscle . After missing the first 11 games of the season , he returned to the lineup at the end of October 1996 . Two weeks after his return , however , he was injured again after suffering a concussion during a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 13 , 1996 , after opposing defenceman Mathieu Schneider hit Kariya in the head with his elbow . While the play was not penalized during the game , Schneider was suspended by the League following the contest . Kariya missed two games as a result of the hit . In the 13 games that he was out of the Ducks ' lineup , the team won one game , lost ten and tied two . Later in the season , Kariya was voted in by fans to the West 's starting lineup in the 1997 All @-@ Star Game . Receiving 210 @,@ 015 votes , he was second among Western Conference wingers to Brett Hull 's 254 @,@ 414 . Joining him on the Western squad were Ducks teammates Selänne and Guy Hebert . During the Game , he scored one goal in an 11 – 7 loss to the East . Returning to club play with the Ducks , he scored the fastest goal to start a game in team history , eight seconds into a match against Colorado on March 9 , 1997 . The contest ended in a 2 – 2 tie . Kariya finished the season with 44 goals and 55 assists , one point short of reaching the 100 @-@ point mark for the second consecutive year . Limited to 69 games due to his injuries , he still ranked third in League point @-@ scoring , behind Selänne and Pittsburgh Penguins captain Mario Lemieux . His + 36 plus @-@ minus rating and ten game @-@ winning goals set Ducks records ( the latter mark was tied by Selänne twice in 1997 – 98 and 2006 – 07 , then broken by Corey Perry 's 11 game @-@ winning goals in 2010 – 11 ) . Nominated for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the League 's MVP , alongside Lemieux and Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hašek , Kariya finished as a runner @-@ up to Hašek . Kariya did , however , win the Lady Byng Award after recording six penalty minutes during the season . In doing so , he became the third player in NHL history to win the award in consecutive years after Mike Bossy ( 1983 and 1984 ) and Wayne Gretzky ( 1991 and 1992 ) . He was also named to the NHL First All @-@ Star Team once more , an honour he shared with Selänne . His efforts helped the Ducks achieve a winning record ( 36 wins , 33 losses and 13 ties ) and reach the playoffs for the first time in team history . Trailing three @-@ games @-@ to @-@ two against the Phoenix Coyotes in the opening round of the 1997 playoffs , the Ducks faced elimination in Game 6 of the series . Kariya scored two goals in the contest , including the overtime @-@ winner , leading the Ducks to a 3 – 2 win . In the ensuing Game 7 , Anaheim won 3 – 0 to eliminate Phoenix . Facing the ( eventual Stanley Cup champions ) Detroit Red Wings in the second round , they were swept in four games . Of the four @-@ game series , one went to overtime , one went to double overtime and one went to triple overtime . Playing 11 games in his first NHL playoff season , Kariya had seven goals and 13 points , which ranked first in team scoring . 
 With his original NHL contract expiring in the off @-@ season , Kariya and the Ducks struggled to agree on a new deal . As a result , Kariya missed the first 32 games of the 1997 – 98 campaign . After making $ 2 @.@ 1 million the previous season , he was reportedly asking for a three @-@ year deal worth $ 27 million , while the Ducks countered with five @-@ year , $ 25 million and seven @-@ year , $ 49 million contracts . Both sides eventually agreed on a two @-@ year , $ 14 million deal in December 1997 . While the initial year of the contract paid Kariya a pro @-@ rated salary of $ 5 @.@ 5 million ( it was also agreed in contract negotiations that Kariya would donate $ 2 million of his first year 's salary to Orange County charities ) , the second year of the contract paid him $ 8 @.@ 5 million , making him the second @-@ highest paid player in League history ( behind Mario Lemieux 's $ 11 million salary in 1996 – 97 ) . During his absence from the Ducks , Kariya trained with the Canadian national team in preparation for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano , Japan . Due to the contract impasse , he missed an opportunity to play in his father 's home country , Japan , as the Mighty Ducks opened the season with a two @-@ game series against the Vancouver Canucks in Tokyo — an effort on the NHL 's part to attract attention to the sport ahead of the Olympics . In his first game back , he recorded two goals and two assists , helping the Mighty Ducks rally from a three @-@ goal deficit to beat the Washington Capitals 6 – 4 . During the second period of the contest , he took a team record seven shots on goal . 
 With several weeks remaining until the start of the Olympics , Kariya suffered another concussion after receiving a cross @-@ check to the face from Chicago Blackhawks defenceman Gary Suter during a game on February 1 , 1998 . Kariya had scored a goal and was standing still at the side of the Blackhawks ' net when Suter hit him . As a result , the Blackhawks defenceman received a four @-@ game suspension from the League . There was wide speculation in the media that the incident was an intentional effort to keep Kariya from playing for Canada at the Olympics ; Suter and teammate Chris Chelios were both members of the United States ' national team . In the past , Suter was also accused of intentionally injuring Wayne Gretzky during a game between Canada and the United States in the 1991 Canada Cup . Canada 's general manager , Bobby Clarke , called the hit a " cheap shot " and publicly echoed the sentiment that Suter wanted to eliminate Kariya from Olympic play . While Kariya was initially expected to recover in time for the Olympics , the injury ( his fourth concussion in three years ) ultimately sidelined him from the competition , as well as the remaining three months of NHL play . Limited to 22 games in 1997 – 98 , Kariya recorded 17 goals and 31 points . 
 Following Suter 's return from suspension , NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke was supposed by Ducks Head Coach Pierre Pagé to have said that he would have given Suter a longer ban if the extent of Kariya 's injuries were immediately known . Later in the season , prior to a game between the Blackhawks and Maple Leafs in April 1998 , Suter received a death threat , presumably for his actions against Kariya , forcing the NHL to position added security at the Blackhawks bench for the contest . With Kariya away from the team for extended periods of time , the Ducks struggled and finished second @-@ last in the West . 
 Suffering from post @-@ concussion syndrome , Kariya experienced headaches and a loss of short @-@ term memory . During his recovery , he was personally encouraged by fellow NHL players Eric Lindros and Pat <unk> , who were also dealing with serious concussions . He was not permitted by doctors to begin training until May 1998 . Leading up to the 1998 – 99 season , Kariya told reporters he was ready to play a rougher style to protect himself from the opposition , including " getting [ his ] stick up " against oncoming players . He also adopted a helmet with increased protection , featuring extra padding and a tighter chin strap . In a similar effort , the Ducks additionally acquired enforcers Stu <unk> and Jim McKenzie during the off @-@ season . During his recovery , Kariya was outspoken regarding the culture of the league regarding excessive physicality , as well as the lack of deterrence . In an article from the Sporting News , he commented that , " There 's too much of a lack of respect players have for one another ... If the league wants to stop that kind of conduct , it will have to punish players ... Ten @-@ game suspensions ... and more , have to be brought back to help wake up players . " He also added that " There probably isn 't a player in the league who hasn 't had a concussion . "

 Fully recovered for the start of the 1998 – 99 season , Kariya returned to NHL play in October 1998 . During a 3 – 2 loss against the Red Wings in November 1998 , he put a team @-@ record 12 shots on goal . Kariya established several other Ducks records in the first half of the campaign , including a 17 @-@ game point @-@ scoring streak on home ice that ended on January 15 , 1999 . He finished with the second 100 @-@ plus point season of his career with 39 goals and a personal best 62 assists . His assists total set a Ducks record that stood for ten years until Ryan Getzlaf recorded 66 in 2008 – 09 . He ranked third in point @-@ scoring among League scorers , behind Selänne and leader Jaromír Jágr of the Pittsburgh Penguins , while ranking first in the League with 429 shots on goal . Ranked sixth in the West , the Mighty Ducks drew the Red Wings in the opening round of the 1999 playoffs . In Game 3 , Kariya blocked a shot with his skate , breaking his right foot . Unavailable for Game 4 , the Ducks lost to the Red Wings and were eliminated . Prior to his injury , Kariya had a goal and four points over three games . Kariya 's comeback season following injury was capped off with his third NHL First Team All @-@ Star distinction , receiving 47 of the possible 58 first @-@ place votes for the left wing position from the Professional Hockey Writers ' Association . Kariya was also nominated for the League 's Bill Masterton Trophy , awarded for perseverance , sportsmanship and dedication to hockey ; he lost to Tampa Bay Lightning forward John Cullen , who attempted to return to the NHL after missing the previous season with non @-@ Hodgkin lymphoma . While Selänne finished as second runner @-@ up for the Lady Byng Trophy , Kariya finished sixth in voting . 
 Having played the final year of his contract , Kariya agreed on a new three @-@ year deal with the Ducks , reported to be worth between $ 32 and $ 33 million , during the ensuing summer . The contract was signed on June 30 , 1999 , one day before he was set to become a restricted free agent . In the three seasons that ensued , Kariya 's offensive production decreased , a period that coincided with the Mighty Ducks failing to qualify for the playoffs each year . 
 During the 1999 – 2000 season , Kariya 's younger brother Steve Kariya began playing for the Vancouver Canucks . On December 8 , 1999 , the Ducks and Canucks met for a contest , marking the first time that the brothers played against each other at any level . Steve recorded an assist on the Canucks ' first goal of the game , before being called for a penalty . On the ensuing Ducks power play , Kariya scored to tie the game at a final score of 2 – 2 . Later in the season , Kariya was speared by San Jose Sharks defenceman Bryan Marchment during a game in March 2000 . Kariya was not injured on the play , though Marchment received a three @-@ game suspension from the NHL . Kariya finished the season with the third @-@ highest goals total of his career with 42 , though his points total dipped to 86 . Nevertheless , he ranked fourth in League scoring , behind Jaromír Jágr , Pavel Bure and Mark Recchi . In the NHL 's season @-@ ending awards , Kariya was named to the NHL Second All @-@ Star Team , having been outvoted for left wing on the First Team by Red Wings forward Brendan Shanahan . He also ranked seventh in Lady Byng voting . 
 During pre @-@ season play in September 2000 , Kariya received a one @-@ game suspension after slashing Minnesota Wild player Aaron <unk> , though he was able to serve the suspension during exhibition play . Several months into the 2000 – 01 season , Kariya suffered a broken right foot after blocking a shot from Tampa Bay Lightning defenceman Pavel <unk> during a game in December 2000 . Missing 15 games , he returned to the lineup in late @-@ January 2001 . The Ducks struggled as a team while both Kariya and Selänne 's paled in comparison to previous years . In March 2001 , Selänne was traded to the San Jose Sharks , marking the end of his duo with Kariya . Despite he and Kariya 's success playing with each other , the Ducks had advanced to the second round of the playoffs just once in their tenure together . While disappointed with the trade , Kariya later commented that with the tandem constituting nearly half of the Ducks ' $ 39 million payroll , " If [ he ] were running the business , [ he ] would have done something too . " Kariya finished the season with 67 points ( 33 goals and 34 assists ) over 66 games . In addition to losing Selänne via trade , Kariya played the majority of the season without centre Steve Rucchin , who was suffering from post @-@ concussion syndrome . 
 Without Selänne for a full season in 2001 – 02 , Kariya 's points total continued to decrease . During the opening month of the campaign , he went ten consecutive game without a goal . Nevertheless , at mid @-@ season , he was named to his sixth NHL All @-@ Star Game in January 2002 ( although it marked the first time he had been named to the All @-@ Star Game without being voted in as a starter by fans ) . Kariya played on a line with Mario Lemieux and Joe Sakic ( a trio that remained intact two weeks later for the 2002 Winter Olympics ) and notched an assist in an 8 – 5 victory for the North American All @-@ Stars . Shortly thereafter , Kariya played in his 500th career NHL game , against the Philadelphia Flyers , a contest in which he recorded a hat @-@ trick to lead his team to a 5 – 4 win . Though he finished with a team @-@ leading 57 points over 82 games , the 2001 – 02 season marked Kariya 's worst statistical year as a Duck and the third @-@ straight year his points total had decreased . The Ducks also suffered as a team , finishing with the third @-@ worst record in the West . Losing fan support , the team drew the worst attendance in franchise history at home games during the season . During the season , he was often asked by reporters how long he was willing to remain with the Ducks while the franchise floundered . In the Canadian media especially , there was a widespread position that Kariya should be moved to a better club . 
 During the off @-@ season , Kariya became a restricted free agent before re @-@ signing with the Ducks to a one @-@ year , $ 10 million contract in July 2002 . Prior to the signing , the Ducks made two key acquisitions , signing playmaking centre Adam Oates to a one @-@ year deal and trading for winger Petr Sýkora from the New Jersey Devils . Both acquisitions were made with Kariya 's input , as well as with the expectation they would play on a line with him . Although Oates was injured at the beginning of the season ( during which time Kariya played with his usual centre , Rucchin ) , the trio formed the Ducks ' top line . Despite playing under a defensive system , implemented by new head coach Mike Babcock , the arrival of Kariya 's new linemates coincided with a resurgence in offensive production for him in 2002 – 03 . Several months into the campaign , however , his father died of a heart attack . The Ducks gave Kariya the option to sit out the following game against the Vancouver Canucks , which he played nonetheless on December 28 , 2002 . He recorded an assist in a 7 – 3 loss . At mid @-@ season , Kariya was selected as a reserve to his seventh and final NHL All @-@ Star Game , held in February 2003 . He scored the deciding shootout goal for the Western Conference , as his team beat the East 6 – 5 . While his 25 goals marked the lowest total of his career since his 22 @-@ game 1997 – 98 season , his 56 assists approached a personal best . With 81 points over 82 games , he led the Ducks in scoring for the fifth time . His efforts helped the Mighty Ducks to the seventh seed in the West , marking the team 's return to the playoffs for the first time in four years . Matching up against the second @-@ seeded Red Wings in the first round , Kariya opened the playoffs with a triple @-@ overtime winner in Game 1 , resulting in a 2 – 1 Ducks win . Anaheim went on to sweep the Red Wings in four games ; Kariya scored his second goal of the series in the deciding contest , a 3 – 2 overtime win . It marked the second time in league history that a team eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champion in four @-@ straight games in the first round . The Mighty Ducks went on to eliminate the Dallas Stars and Minnesota Wild in the next two rounds to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history . During Game 6 of the series against New Jersey , a contest in which the Ducks faced elimination , Kariya received a hard open @-@ ice hit from opposing defenceman Scott Stevens . Laying motionless on the ice for several minutes , he needed to be helped to the dressing room . Many felt Kariya 's equipment changes following his first concussion may have saved him from being rendered unconscious from the Stevens hit . Four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes of playing time later , he returned to the game . Following his return , he scored on a slapshot while skating down the wing to give the Ducks a 4 – 1 lead . Anaheim went on to win the game 5 – 2 to force a Game 7 ; Kariya finished the contest with a goal and two assists . Reactions regarding Stevens ' hit were divided following the game . Kariya told reporters that after looking at replays that Stevens had used his elbow , while Ducks Head Coach Mike Babcock described it as a late hit . The play was not penalized during the game , however , and Stevens received no disciplinary measures from the League . Playing the deciding Game 7 in New Jersey , the Ducks lost the Stanley Cup by a 3 – 0 score . Over 21 games , Kariya finished third on the team in playoff scoring ( behind Adam Oates and Petr Sýkora ) , scoring six goals and 12 points . Much of Anaheim 's success was predicated on goaltender Jean @-@ Sébastien Giguère 's performance , who was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP . Kariya , meanwhile , was often singled out for his lack of consistent impact throughout the playoffs . As the highest @-@ profile player on the Ducks , he drew matchups against opposing teams top defencemen during the post @-@ season , such as Willie Mitchell against the Wild and Stevens against the Devils . He had also played part of the post @-@ season with a separated shoulder . 
 Game 7 of the Finals marked Kariya 's last game as a Mighty Duck . After nine seasons , he left Anaheim as the team 's all @-@ time leader in games played ( 606 ) , goals ( 300 ) , assists ( 369 ) , points ( 669 ) , short handed goals ( 16 ) and shots ( 2 @,@ 455 ) . His seven seasons as team captain also set a Ducks record . After Selänne returned to the Ducks in 2005 , Kariya 's marks in games played , goals , assists and points were all broken .

 Following the Mighty Ducks ' Stanley Cup run , Kariya became an unrestricted free agent in the off @-@ season . With Kariya requiring a $ 10 million qualifying offer from Anaheim to remain the team , General Manager Bryan Murray let him go to free agency . Murray went on record saying , " We understand that he is an important player for the franchise ... but when you are trying to build a team it 's hard to have one player at $ 10 million when your payroll is the mid to low ( $ 40 million range ) . " It was reported that the team had tried negotiating a longer @-@ term deal with a decreased salary , while Murray told media at the time that he would remain in negotiations with Kariya to sign him for less . With former linemate Teemu Selänne also entering unrestricted free agency that summer after three years with San Jose ( he decided to opt out of his final year , valued at $ 6 @.@ 5 million ) , the duo agreed to reunite and sign with the same team . Together , they approached the Colorado Avalanche , having decided the team had the best chance of winning the Stanley Cup . On July 3 , 2003 , the Avalanche announced the signing of Kariya and Selänne to one @-@ year contracts . In order for the team to afford both players , Kariya took an $ 8 @.@ 8 million paycut from his $ 10 million salary with Anaheim the previous year , marking the highest decrease in compensation for a player in NHL history . At $ 1 @.@ 2 million , his salary was below the NHL average , ensuring that he would have the freedom of unrestricted free agency at the end of the season . Selänne , meanwhile , signed for $ 5 @.@ 8 million . Their deals were partially facilitated by goaltender Patrick Roy 's retirement , which freed up $ 8 @.@ 5 million in salary . 
 Kariya and Selänne joined an already high @-@ powered Avalanche team that included such forwards as Joe Sakic , Peter Forsberg , Milan Hejduk and Alex Tanguay . Despite high expectations for the duo 's reunion , Kariya and Selänne both struggled in their sole years with Colorado . After beginning the 2003 – 04 season on a line with Selänne centred by Joe Sakic , Kariya suffered a sprained right wrist in a game against the Boston Bruins on October 21 , 2003 . After being sidelined for ten games , he returned in mid @-@ November , but re @-@ injured his wrist in his first contest back . Due to the injury , Kariya missed playing against the Ducks for the first time in a home game on November 18 . Still recovering a month later , he remained sidelined for a return to Anaheim 's Arrowhead Pond on December 20 . Kariya 's departure from the Ducks drew criticism from his previous team 's fans . In anticipation of the Avalanche @-@ Ducks game on December 20 , Anaheim fans began a fund that raised over $ 1 @,@ 200 to be given to the favourite charity of the Ducks player who scores the game @-@ winning goal against Colorado . The idea was precipitated by reports that Kariya had given Selänne $ 3 @,@ 000 for scoring the game @-@ winning goal against the Ducks on November 18 ( it is an informal tradition in the NHL for players to offer rewards to teammates who score against former teams ) . Kariya returned to the Avalanche lineup in time for their next game against the Ducks on January 13 , 2004 , at the Pepsi Center . He scored one goal in a 3 – 1 win . Later that month , he played his first game against the Ducks in Anaheim on January 30 . <unk> every time he touched puck , he recorded two assists , as the Avalanche lost 4 – 3 in overtime . Limited by injuries , Kariya scored below his career pace with 11 goals and 36 points over 51 games . Selänne recorded 32 points , while playing in 78 games . In the final game of the regular season , Kariya injured his right ankle against the Nashville Predators on April 4 . As a team , Colorado lost their division for the first time in nine years to the Vancouver Canucks . Qualifying for the 2004 playoffs as the fourth seed in the West , they lost in the second round to the Sharks . Kariya returned to the Colorado lineup in time for Game 6 against the Sharks , recording an assist as the Avalanche were eliminated by a score of 3 – 1 .

 Due to the NHL lockout , Kariya was professionally inactive for the 2004 – 05 season , using the time to recover from several nagging injuries . He incorrectly predicted that the dispute would last " a year @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half [ or ] two years , " as the players and owners agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement ( CBA ) in July 2005 . With NHL play set to resume for the 2005 – 06 season , Kariya became an unrestricted free agent in August 2005 . Entertaining offers from 10 different teams , Kariya signed a two @-@ year , $ 9 million contract with the Nashville Predators on August 5 , 2005 , making him the highest @-@ paid player in team history . Four days later , he was officially introduced as a member of the Predators at a news conference . Predators General Manager David Poile heralded the acquisition as " unquestionably the biggest signing in [ the ] club 's history . " He ultimately chose the Predators for their style of play emphasizing skating and speed . Following the lockout , the NHL adopted several rule changes meant to benefit fast and skilled players such as Kariya . He was one of many NHL players who had publicly spoken out regarding the League 's failed attempts in the past to reduce obstruction . During an earlier League @-@ sponsored conference call with the media , Kariya criticized league rules , stating , " As an offensive player , I 'm going through the neutral zone , and I have a player tugging me the whole way . If I don 't go down , I 'm not going to get a call because they are not going to make the call . " Having come off the worst statistical season of his career in 2003 – 04 , Kariya was admittedly looking to have a bounce @-@ back season . 
 During the Predators ' training camp in September 2005 , Kariya suffered separate ankle and groin injuries that limited his participation in team practices and pre @-@ season games . Recovering in time for the season @-@ opener , he debuted with the Predators on October 5 , 2005 , at home against the San Jose Sharks . Early in the game , Kariya was routinely cheered by fans when he touched the puck . Trailing 2 – 1 in the third period , he scored on goaltender Evgeni Nabokov to the tie the game , en route to a 3 – 2 win . The following game , Kariya participated in his first NHL shootout ( the tie @-@ breaker was newly implemented by the League for the 2005 – 06 season ) after the Predators remained tied with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 2 – 2 following overtime . The last of three shooters for the Predators , Kariya was the lone player to score in the shootout , leading Nashville to a 3 – 2 win . The two wins helped Nashville go undefeated in their first eight games , two wins shy of the League 's record for consecutive victories to start a season . On April 18 , 2006 , the last day of the regular season , Kariya scored a hat @-@ trick against the Detroit Red Wings in a 6 – 3 win , helping the Predators secure the fourth seed in the Western Conference . In his first season with Nashville , Kariya set team records with 31 goals , 54 assists and 85 points . His 14 power play goals also tied defenceman Andy Delmore 's team record set in 2002 – 03 , while his 245 shots came within three of Cliff Ronning 's mark set in 1998 – 99 . With five shootout goals over seven attempts , Kariya ranked fourth in the NHL in shootout scoring percentage at 71 @.@ 4 % ( among players who had taken at least five attempts ) . On a team basis , the Predators set franchise records with 49 wins and 106 points , ranking fourth in the West . Matching up against the San Jose Sharks in the first round of the 2006 playoffs , Kariya opened the post @-@ season with four assists in Game 1 to lead Nashville to a 4 – 3 win . After taking Game 1 , the Predators went on to lose the next four contests and were eliminated from the playoffs . The team was markedly weakened for the playoffs with starting goaltender Tomáš Vokoun unavailable due to injury and Kariya 's linemate Steve Sullivan playing hurt . Kariya had two goals and seven points over the series . 
 After the Predators ' regular season success in 2005 – 06 , the team bolstered their lineup by acquiring centre Jason Arnott and winger Jean @-@ Pierre Dumont . In response to Arnott 's signing , Kariya commented that the centre position , as well as size , were weaknesses for the team the previous year , especially when they matched up against the Sharks ' top two centres , Joe Thornton and Patrick Marleau , in the playoffs . Leading up to the 2006 – 07 season , the Predators were picked by many analysts in the media ( including those from The Globe and Mail and ESPN ) to contend for the Stanley Cup . Prior to the start of the campaign , the Predators announced defenceman Kimmo Timonen as the team 's new captain , while naming Kariya and Steve Sullivan as alternates ( the two served in that role the previous season , as well , but not on a permanent basis ) . With Kariya leading the team in scoring , the team boasted the top record in the league by the All @-@ Star break . At the NHL trade deadline , the team further bolstered their lineup by acquiring high @-@ profile centre Peter Forsberg from Philadelphia . Forsberg joined Kariya on the top line , though not consistently . With 76 points ( 24 goals and 52 assists ) — the second highest total in team history — over 82 games , Kariya led the Predators in scoring for a second @-@ straight year . His seven shootout goals ( over 11 attempts ) tied for second in the league , one behind Erik Christensen of the Pittsburgh Penguins . The Predators continued to improve and finished with a new team record of 51 wins and 110 points . Despite ranking as the second @-@ best team in the West , Nashville seeded fourth in their conference ( divisional winners within the conference take the top three seeds ; Detroit beat the Predators by there points in the Central Division ) . Playing against the San Jose Sharks for the second consecutive year , the Predators were once again eliminated in five games . Kariya struggled with two assists during the series . 
 During the off @-@ season , Predators owner Craig <unk> put the team up for sale ; two of the leading candidates to buy the franchise both had plans to relocate the team . With Kariya 's contract expiring , he chose not to re @-@ sign with Nashville , citing the team 's uncertain future . 
 = = = St. Louis Blues = = = 
 On July 1 , 2007 , Kariya signed a three @-@ year contract worth $ 18 million with the St. Louis Blues . In similar fashion to his signing with Nashville , his arrival in St. Louis marked one of the team 's first notable free agent acquisitions in a while ( arguably since the team signed Brendan Shanahan in 1991 ) . While the Predators were a team on the rise when he joined them , the Blues had contrastingly missed the playoffs in the previous two seasons . 
 Although Blues winger Jay McClement was in possession of the jersey number 9 upon Kariya 's arrival in the off @-@ season , he surrendered it so Kariya could retain his usual number . Assigned as an alternate captain for the team , Kariya rotated the position with Keith Tkachuk , and Barret Jackman throughout the 2008 – 09 season . Kariya debuted with the team on October 4 , 2007 , registering an assist in a 3 – 2 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes . After recording six assists in his first four games as a Blue , Kariya scored his first goal with St. Louis on October 17 , 2007 , in a 3 – 1 win against the Chicago Blackhawks . Two months later , Kariya recorded his tenth career NHL hat @-@ trick against the Dallas Stars on December 29 , scoring the Blues ' final three goals , including the game @-@ tying marker with ten seconds remaining in regulation . He was stopped in the shootout , however , by Mike Smith as the Stars won the game 5 – 4 . With the hat trick , Kariya reached the 900 @-@ point mark in his NHL career . Despite a decrease in offensive production , Kariya tied winger Brad Boyes for the team lead in scoring with 65 points ( 16 goals and 49 assists ) over 82 games . The Blues finished with the second @-@ worst record in the Western Conference with 33 wins and 79 points . 
 A month into 2008 – 09 season , Kariya suffered a hip injury after being hit from behind in a game against the Anaheim Ducks on November 5 , 2008 , tearing muscle fibers near the top his left thigh . The injury was initially undisclosed at the time and was erroneously reported as having resulted from a blocked shot . At the time of the injury , he had 15 points ( 2 goals and 13 assists ) over 11 games , tying him for sixth in NHL scoring . After nearly two months of recovery , he began practicing with the Blues , but had a setback in late @-@ December ; a subsequent MRI exam revealed additional hip damage . Undergoing surgery for a torn acetabular labrum on January 5 , 2009 , the team listed him as sidelined indefinitely , while Blues President John Davidson told reporters he might be back late that season or the next . The following month , another MRI revealed a torn labrum in the opposite side of his hip , as well , requiring a second surgery . Despite the loss of Kariya , the Blues made the playoffs for the first time since 2004 . With the Blues matching up against the Vancouver Canucks in the first round , Kariya began practicing with the team in hopes of a comeback for the playoffs . He told reporters that he felt " stronger that [ he had ] ... since 1999 . " The Blues were swept in four games however , before Kariya could return . 
 Fully recovered by the start of the 2009 – 10 season , Kariya made his return to the Blues lineup on October 2 , 2009 , a game played in Stockholm . He scored two goals in a 4 – 3 win against the Detroit Red Wings . On March 18 , 2010 , Kariya scored the 400th goal of his NHL career , against the New York Rangers . A week later , he recorded the 402nd and final goal of his career , in a 3 – 1 win against the Los Angeles Kings . Kariya played his last NHL game on April 11 , 2010 , against his former team , the Nashville Predators . With the Blues trailing by one goal in the third period , Kariya helped set up David Backes ' game @-@ tying goal , marking his 25th assist of the season and final point of his career . The Blues went on to lose the game 2 – 1 in a shootout . 
 During his last season in the NHL , the League began expanding their efforts to eliminate hits to the head with new rules and stiffer penalties . League officials also began looking to penalize " blindside hits , " defined as a bodycheck against a player from the side , where he cannot see the ensuing player coming . At the time , Kariya called the pending rule changes " long overdue , " adding that , " hav [ ing ] been through so much with that ... It 's something that should 've been in place years and years ago . " 
 With his contract expiring in the off @-@ season , Teemu Selänne , who had since returned to the Ducks , was reportedly in talks with team management to sign Kariya . On August 27 , 2010 , however , on the advice of doctors who refused to clear him to play , Kariya announced that he would sit out the 2010 – 11 season with post @-@ concussion syndrome . While the symptoms eventually did subside somewhat , the same doctors advised Kariya that it was too risky to try to play again , and Kariya officially announced his retirement from hockey on June 29 , 2011 , through the NHLPA . He continued to be outspoken regarding the prevalence of concussions among hockey players ; in an interview with the Globe and Mail , he commented , " The thing I worry about is that you 'll get a guy who is playing with a concussion , and he gets hit , and he dies at centre ice . " 
 = = International career = = 
 In the summer of 1991 , Kariya joined the Canadian Under @-@ 18 Selects Team at the Phoenix Cup , the inaugural tournament of what would go on to become the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament . Kariya led all scorers with ten points in six games while being named to the Tournament All @-@ Star Team . Canada won the silver medal , losing out to the Soviet Union . 
 The following year , he moved up to the Canadian under @-@ 20 team for the 1992 World Junior Championships in Germany . The youngest player on the team , he recorded a goal and an assist over six games as Canada finished in sixth place . Playing in the tournament a second consecutive year in 1993 , Kariya improved to two goals and eight points over seven games , ranking second in team scoring behind Martin Lapointe . Helping Canada to a record of six <unk> one loss , they tied Sweden for first overall in the standings , but won the gold medal by way of their 5 – 4 win against them in their second game . The championship marked Kariya 's first international gold medal and began a streak of five consecutive gold medals for Canada at the tournament . He was named to the Tournament All @-@ Star Team , alongside Canadian goaltender Manny Legace and defenceman Brent Tully . Nearly ten years later , TSN held a fan @-@ voted poll on the Internet to select Canada 's all @-@ time World Junior team . The poll garnered in excess of 350 @,@ 000 votes with Kariya chosen as one of 13 forwards on the team . 
 Four months later , in April 1993 , Kariya debuted with the Canadian men 's team in the IIHF World Championships , held in Germany . At 18 years and six months , he became the youngest player in Canadian history to play at the tournament . He scored nine points in eight games as Canada finished in fourth place . 
 Later that year , in December 1993 , Kariya left his college team , the Maine Black Bears , to join the Canadian national team in preparation for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer , Norway . At the start of the tournament , Canada was seeded seventh overall and were not considered favourites to do well . Playing on a line with Chris Kontos and Petr Nedved , Kariya led his team in scoring with three goals and seven points over eight games , helping Canada to a silver medal . Tied with the Czech Republic 2 – 2 in the quarterfinal , Kariya scored the game @-@ winning goal after 16 minutes of overtime play to help the Canadians advance . In the gold medal game , Kariya scored the first goal as Canada went on to lose 3 – 2 in a shootout to Sweden . With a chance to tie the shootout after Swedish forward Peter Forsberg scored , Swedish goaltender Tommy Salo stopped Kariya with a glove save . 
 Two months later , Kariya joined Team Canada for the 1994 Men 's World Championships in Italy . He was the lone player on the team to have continued on from the Olympics , as well as the youngest , while playing on a line with Jason Arnott and Brendan Shanahan . During round @-@ robin play , he netted a hat trick against Austria in a 6 – 1 win . In the quarterfinal , he added a goal and an assist in a win over the Czech Republic . Canada advanced to the final , where they defeated Finland 2 – 1 to capture the gold medal . It marked the first championship at the tournament for Canada in 33 years . Kariya finished the tournament with a team @-@ high five goals and 12 points over eight games and received Best Forward and All @-@ Star Team honours on the latter , he was joined by Canadian goaltender Bill Ranford . With his success at the 1994 Winter Olympics and World Championships , Wayne Gretzky heralded Kariya as the next NHL superstar . 
 In January 1996 , Kariya finished as a runner @-@ up to Wayne Gretzky for the inaugural Jean Beliveau Award , an annual distinction from Hockey Canada for players who have demonstrated " outstanding playing ability and international experience while maintaining the fundamentals of sportsmanship and fair play . " Unlike most annual awards , the distinction did not take into account players ' performances in the prior year , but their contributions on a career @-@ basis . The initial three nominees were chosen by a selection committee , while the winner was determined by fan vote . Randy Gregg was the other nominee . 
 Following his second NHL season , Kariya was named to Canada 's team for the 1996 World Championships in Vienna . During the round @-@ robin , he scored a hat @-@ trick against the United States , helping Canada to a 5 – 1 win , qualifying them for the quarterfinals . During their semifinal against Russia , Kariya scored in the shootout to help Canada to a 3 – 2 win . Advancing to the gold medal game , they lost 4 – 2 to the Czech Republic . Kariya finished the competition with four goals and seven points over eight games , earning him a spot as Canada 's lone representative on the Tournament 's First All @-@ Star Team . Over three World Championship appearances , Kariya recorded 28 points ( 11 goals and 17 assists ) over 24 games , which at the time , ranked him at third all @-@ time among Canadian scorers , behind Steve Yzerman 's 39 points and Marcel Dionne 's 32 . 
 Prior to the World Championships , Canada also named Kariya to their team for the 1996 World Cup , which was held in August and September . However , Kariya was kept from competing due to a groin inflammation . During a news conference , he called his withdrawal the " biggest disappointment of [ his ] hockey career . " The World Cup would have marked his first international appearance in a best @-@ on @-@ best tournament , as the competition did not interfere with the Stanley Cup playoffs as the World Championships did . Kariya was replaced in the lineup by New York Rangers winger Adam Graves . Canada went on to finish as runner @-@ up to the United States in the tournament . 
 In June 1997 , Kariya was again nominated for the Jean Beliveau Award , alongside Gregg , but lost to Bobby Orr . 
 Four years after his first Olympic appearance as an amateur , the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano , Japan , were set to become the first Games in which NHL players could compete in ice hockey . While Kariya was involved in a contract dispute with the Mighty Ducks , causing him to miss the start of the 1997 – 98 NHL season , Hockey Canada contacted Kariya , asking him to provide a training regimen by December 1 , 1997 , ensuring that he would be physically ready to play in the Olympics , given his inactivity in the NHL . Before agreeing to a contract with the Ducks in December , he joined the Canadian national team in training . On November 29 , 1997 , Canadian General Manager Bobby Clarke announced his roster for the Games , which included Kariya . He was the youngest player named to the team , behind defenceman Chris Pronger , who was born six days earlier . Less than a month to go before the start of the tournament , held in February 1998 , however , he suffered a concussion , resulting from an on @-@ ice <unk> to the head from Chicago Blackhawks defenceman Gary Suter . The hit received much publicity as Suter , a member of the United States ' national team , was accused by many in the media , as well as Bobby Clarke for targeting Kariya specifically in order to sideline him for the Olympics . He again described the missed opportunity as the " biggest disappointment of [ his ] career , " adding that he was looking forward to playing in Japan , having family there . 
 Leading up to the next Winter Olympics , Kariya was chosen as one of eight initial players to Canada 's roster on March 23 , 2001 . Playing on the top line with Mario Lemieux , Kariya scored three goals and one assist over six games , tying for fourth in Canadian point @-@ scoring . He registered his first goal of the tournament in Canada 's second game , a 3 – 2 win against Germany . His second came against Belarus in the semi @-@ final , qualifying Canada for the gold medal game . Playing the United States in the final , Kariya scored Canada 's first goal of the game , tying the score at 1 – 1 in the first period . Canada went on to win 5 – 2 , capturing their first Olympic gold medal since 1952 . Canada 's roster was later inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame under the team category on March 26 , 2009 , during a ceremony in Vancouver . 
 Despite Kariya 's success with Canada at the 2002 Olympics , he had come off the worst statistical season of his career prior to the national team 's summer development camp in preparation for the 2006 Winter Olympics . His omission was singled out by the media ; General Manager Wayne Gretzky , who selected the camp 's participants , explained publicly , " Paul is a great player , but at some point you have to have a cutoff , " while also asserting that he had spoken to Kariya personally regarding the situation . After a strong start to the 2005 – 06 NHL season , Kariya was one of 49 forwards chosen in October 2005 to Canada 's preliminary list of players to be selected from for the final roster . When the team was announced in December 2005 , however , he was not chosen . 
 During his career , Kariya became involved with Hockey Canada off the ice , as well . In the late 1990s , he joined the organization as a national spokesperson with women 's team forward Jayna <unk> for the Initiation Program , promoting a safe and positive experience for children first becoming involved with hockey . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Kariya was known for his skilled and entertaining style of play . An offensive player , he was a fast skater with strong puck @-@ handling and passing abilities . Prior to and early in his NHL career , Kariya drew comparisons to Wayne Gretzky . During the 1994 Winter Olympics , American Head Coach Tim Taylor likened his skating and playmaking ability to Gretzky 's , while Kariya 's linemate , Chris Kontos , described his on @-@ ice vision as " Gretzky @-@ like . " Canadian Head Coach Tom Renney heralded him as " think [ ing ] and play [ ing ] at a better speed than anybody else , " adding that his teammates " are usually a half @-@ step behind him . " His speed made him particularly adept in international competition , as games were played on a larger ice surface in comparison to the NHL . Following his first NHL goal against Winnipeg , Jets Head Coach John Paddock told reporters , " like with Gretzky the puck seems to following him around ... It looks like he 's cherry @-@ picking , but he 's not . That 's just great instinct . " Kariya himself cited Gretzky , as well as Brett Hull , Jeremy Roenick and Pavel Bure as players he liked patterning his game after . Kariya was also recognized for his " hockey sense " and the cerebral aspect of his game , which included analyzing the game at a high level . His first NHL coach , Ron Wilson , also once described Kariya as " the hardest @-@ working athlete [ he 's ] ever been associated with . " 
 While recognized primarily as a playmaker leading up to his NHL career , Kariya was forced into shooting more as the Mighty Ducks lacked scorers in his first two seasons with the team . During his third NHL season , he commented that , " If Teemu [ Selänne ] had been here right off the bat , then maybe I wouldn 't have focused so much on shooting . " Kariya was able to put many shots on goal due to his quick release . In 1998 – 99 , he led the League with 429 shots on goal , which at the time was the second @-@ highest recorded total in NHL history . Nonetheless maintaining his passing ability , Kariya was particularly adept at making plays from deep in the offensive zone and beside the opposing team 's net .

 " Simpson and Delilah " is the second episode of The Simpsons ' second season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 18 , 1990 . Homer uses the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant medical insurance plan to buy ' Dimoxinil ' , a miracle hair growth formula . Homer grows hair , and is given a promotion at work which allows him to hire a secretary named Karl . The episode was directed by Rich Moore and written by Jon Vitti , and guest starred Harvey Fierstein as Karl . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Homer sees an advertisement for Dimoxinil , a new " miracle breakthrough " for baldness . He visits a store which sells Dimoxinil , but at $ 1000 it is far out of Homer 's price range . At work , Lenny suggests Homer pay for Dimoxinil through the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant medical insurance plan . The druggist yells that Dimoxinil is a frivolous product that is not covered by any medical insurance , but whispers to Homer that he will arrange an under @-@ the @-@ table trade . Homer successfully applies the drug , and after using it , he wakes up the next day to the thrill of having a full head of hair , and runs throughout the town blissfully . At work , Mr. Burns surveys the security monitors to find a new person to promote to an executive position . He sees Homer with hair and , mistaking him for a young go @-@ getter , chooses Homer for the job . 
 As he is about to become an executive , Homer tries to look for a good secretary , but all the applicants fail due to being seductive young women – until Homer finds a man named Karl , who earnestly persuades Homer to tell himself that he deserves everything he has and is the finest creature God ever created . Homer eventually picks Karl , and they go shopping for a suit . At an executive board meeting , Homer is singled out by an impressed Burns to give a suggestion to increase worker productivity , and Homer meekly suggests that he give more tartar sauce in the lunch room , which Mr. Burns does . Following the increase in tartar sauce distribution , Mr. Burns is glad to hear that workplace safety is on the up @-@ and @-@ up and accidents are down . Smithers remarks that all the past accidents were either caused by Homer or believed to be traced to him . However , Burns tells Smithers to stop being negative and even accuses him of harboring jealousy towards Homer . Homer forgets his wedding anniversary , but Marge forgives him due to his new demanding schedule . Karl covers for Homer by hiring a singing telegram service to serenade Marge with " You Are So Beautiful " , which Marge loves . 
 Homer becomes successful and receives the honor of being given the key to the executive washroom . Smithers begins to feel jealous of Homer for his high standing with Mr. Burns and searches Homer 's file , finding the damaging information he seeks in the case of insurance fraud that gave Homer hair in the first place . Smithers gleefully prepares to fire Homer for the fraud , but Karl takes the blame for Homer and writes the $ 1000 check to repay the company . Frustrated , Smithers is instead forced to fire Karl , who has sacrificed his own job to save Homer 's . Homer is deeply saddened to see Karl go after all Karl had done for him , including lending Homer his umbrella before finally leaving in the rain . Homer is invited to give a speech at the next meeting , and Smithers does his best to ruin Homer 's confidence . Homer is nervous about giving the speech without Karl , but reasons that as long as he has hair , everything will be fine . 
 Meanwhile , at home , Bart uses some of the Dimoxinil in a misguided attempt to grow a beard . When Homer enters and catches Bart , Bart accidentally drops the Dimoxinil , spilling it all onto the floor . By the next day , Homer has lost all his hair and , bald again , arrives at the meeting .

Burns angrily summons Homer , threatening to fire him , but reveals photographs of himself with strawberry curly hair in his younger years when girls flocked to him until he went bald , and as a fellow sufferer of male pattern baldness , sympathizes with Homer 's situation and merely demotes him back to his old position rather than terminating him . 
 At home later that night , Homer confesses to Marge he is afraid that his life has returned to a dead @-@ end job , that his kids will be disappointed because he can no longer buy the things for them he promised he would , and most of all that Marge will no longer love him as much .

Marge then reaffirms her love for Homer as they sing " You Are So Beautiful " together into the night .

 Homer 's hair product Dimoxinil is a spoof on a similar product , <unk> , which fascinated the writers . After growing hair , the production staff tried to give Homer a new hair design in every scene . The character Karl was played by openly gay actor Harvey Fierstein . Groening had originally intended to design Karl to look like Fierstein , who objected to the idea because he felt he did not " look like gay people , how they 're supposed to look . " Fierstein suggested that the character be made " blond , and tall , and gorgeous , and skinny , and [ given ] a beautiful place to live . " 
 The episode features a kiss between Homer and Karl , which occurred a decade prior to US television 's first real man @-@ on @-@ man kiss on Dawson 's Creek . In the episode , Karl is implied to be homosexual ; creator Matt Groening says that when people began asking " was he gay ? " the day after the episode aired , his response was " he 's whatever you want him to be . " However , Groening points out , " he does kiss Homer : He does give him a nice pat on the butt " which is " beyond [ what ] any other cartoon " had done at the time . 
 Karl was originally supposed to return for a cameo appearance in the season 14 episode " Three Gays of the Condo " . In the script , Homer was thrown out of the house by Marge , and encountered Karl . The purpose of the appearance was to introduce a gay couple that Homer would live with . Fierstein however felt that " the script was a lot of very clever gay jokes , and there just wasn 't that Simpsons twist " and turned the role down .

 Opus Dei , formally known as The Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei ( Latin : <unk> Sanctae Crucis et <unk> Dei ) , is an institution of the Roman Catholic Church that teaches that everyone is called to holiness and that ordinary life is a path to sanctity . The majority of its membership are lay people , with secular priests under the governance of a prelate ( bishop ) elected by specific members and appointed by the Pope . Opus Dei is Latin for " Work of God " ; hence the organization is often referred to by members and supporters as the Work . 
 Founded in Spain in 1928 by the Catholic saint and priest Josemaría Escrivá , Opus Dei was given final Catholic Church approval in 1950 by Pope Pius XII . In 1982 , by the apostolic constitution Ut sit , St. John Paul II made it a personal prelature — that is , the jurisdiction of its own bishop covers the persons in Opus Dei wherever they are , rather than geographical dioceses . 
 As of 2015 , members of the Prelature numbered 93 @,@ 986 . Lay persons , men and women , numbered 91 @,@ 020 while there were 2 @,@ 094 priests . These figures do not include the diocesan priest members of Opus Dei 's Priestly Society of the Holy Cross , estimated to number 2 @,@ 000 in the year 2005 . Members are in more than 90 countries . About 70 percent of Opus Dei members live in their private homes , leading traditional Catholic family lives with secular careers , while the other 30 per cent are celibate , of whom the majority live in Opus Dei centres . Opus Dei organizes training in Catholic spirituality applied to daily life . Aside from personal charity and social work , Opus Dei members are involved in running universities , university residences , schools , publishing houses , and technical and agricultural training centers . 
 Opus Dei has been described as the most controversial force within the Catholic Church . According to several journalists who researched Opus Dei separately , many criticisms against Opus Dei are based on fabrications by opponents , and Opus Dei is considered a sign of contradiction . Several popes and other Catholic leaders have endorsed what they see as its innovative teaching on the sanctifying value of work , and its fidelity to Catholic beliefs . In 2002 , Pope John Paul II canonized Escrivá , and called him " the saint of ordinary life . " Criticism of Opus Dei has centered on allegations of secretiveness , controversial recruiting methods , strict rules governing members , elitism and misogyny , and support of or participation in authoritarian or right @-@ wing governments , especially the Francoist Government of Spain until 1978 . The mortification of the flesh practiced by some of its members is also criticized . Within the Catholic Church , Opus Dei is also criticized for allegedly seeking independence and more influence . In recent years , Opus Dei has received international attention due to the novel The Da Vinci Code and its film version of 2006 , both of which prominent Christians and non @-@ believers criticized as misleading , inaccurate and anti @-@ Catholic . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = <unk> period = = = 
 Opus Dei was founded by a Catholic priest , Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer , on 2 October 1928 in Madrid , Spain . According to Escrivá , on that day he experienced a vision in which he " saw Opus Dei " . He gave the organization the name " Opus Dei " , which in Latin means " Work of God " , in order to underscore the belief that the organization was not his ( Escrivá 's ) work , but was rather God 's work . Throughout his life , Escrivá held that the founding of Opus Dei had a supernatural character . Escrivá summarized Opus Dei 's mission as a way of helping ordinary Christians " to understand that their life ... is a way of holiness and evangelization ... And to those who grasp this ideal of holiness , the Work offers the spiritual assistance and training they need to put it into practice . " 
 Initially , Opus Dei was open only to men , but in 1930 , Escrivá started to admit women , based on what he believed to be a communication from God . In 1936 , the organization suffered a temporary setback with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War , as many Catholic priests and religious figures , including Escrivá , were forced into hiding ( the Catholic Church actively supported the Nationalist rebels ) . The many atrocities committed during the civil war included the murder and rape of religious figures by anti @-@ Franco Anarchists . After the civil war was won by General Francisco Franco , Escrivá was able to return to Madrid . Escriva himself recounted that it was in Spain where Opus Dei found " the greatest difficulties " because of traditionalists who he felt misunderstood Opus Dei 's ideas . Despite this , Opus Dei flourished during the years of the <unk> , spreading first throughout Spain , and after 1945 , expanding internationally . 
 In 1939 , Escrivá published The Way , a collection of 999 maxims concerning spirituality for people involved in secular affairs . In the 1940s , Opus Dei found an early critic in the Jesuit Superior General <unk> <unk> , who told the Vatican that he considered Opus Dei " very dangerous for the Church in Spain , " citing its " secretive character " and calling it " a form of Christian Masonry . " 
 In 1947 , a year after Escrivá moved the organization 's headquarters to Rome , Opus Dei received a decree of praise and approval from Pope Pius XII , making it an institute of " pontifical right " , i.e. under the direct governance of the Pope . In 1950 , Pius XII granted definitive approval to Opus Dei , thereby allowing married people to join the organisation , and secular clergy to be admitted to the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross . 
 = = = Post @-@ foundational years = = = 
 In 1975 , Escriva died and was succeeded by Álvaro del Portillo . In 1982 , Opus Dei was made into a personal prelature . This means that Opus Dei is part of the universal Church , and the apostolate of the members falls under the direct jurisdiction of the Prelate of Opus Dei wherever they are . As to " what the law lays down for all the ordinary faithful " , the lay members of Opus Dei , being no different from other Catholics , " continue to be ... under the jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop " , in the words of John Paul II 's Ut Sit . In 1994 , Javier Echevarria became Prelate upon the death of his predecessor . 
 One @-@ third of the world 's bishops sent letters petitioning for the canonization of Escrivá . Escriva was beatified in 1992 in the midst of controversy prompted by questions about Escriva 's suitability for sainthood . In 2002 , approximately 300 @,@ 000 people gathered in St. Peter 's Square on the day Pope John Paul II canonised Josemaría Escrivá . According to one author , " Escrivá is ... venerated by millions " . 
 There are other members whose process of beatification has been opened : Ernesto <unk> , a father of five children and a pioneer in paediatric research in Guatemala ; Montserrat <unk> , a teenage Catalan student who died of cancer ; Toni Zweifel , a Swiss engineer ; Tomás Alvira and wife , Paquita Domínguez , a Spanish married couple ; Isidoro <unk> , an Argentinian engineer ; Dora del Hoyo , a domestic worker ; and Father José Luis <unk> de Miguel . 
 During the pontificate of John Paul II , two members of Opus Dei , Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne and Julián Herranz Casado , were made cardinals . 
 In September 2005 , Pope Benedict XVI blessed a newly installed statue of Josemaría Escrivá placed in an outside wall niche of St Peter 's Basilica , a place for founders of Catholic organisations . 
 During that same year , Opus Dei received some unwanted attention due to the extraordinary success of the novel The Da Vinci Code , in which both Opus Dei and the Catholic Church itself are depicted negatively . The film version was released globally in May 2006 , further polarising views on the organisation . 
 In 2014 , Pope Francis through a delegate beatified Alvaro del Portillo and said that " he teaches us that in the simplicity and ordinariness of our life we can find a sure path to holiness . 
 At the end of 2014 , the prelature has been established in 69 countries , while its members are present in 90 countries .

 = = = Doctrine = = = 
 Opus Dei is an organisation of the Catholic Church . As such , it shares the doctrines of the Catholic Church and has " no other teaching than the teaching of the Magisterium of the Holy See " , as per the founder . 
 Opus Dei places special emphasis on certain aspects of Catholic doctrine . A central feature of Opus Dei 's theology is its focus on the lives of the ordinary Catholics who are neither priests nor monks . Opus Dei emphasises the " universal call to holiness " : the belief that everyone should aspire to be a saint , as per Jesus ' commandment to " Love God with all your heart " ( Matthew 22 : 37 ) and " Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect . " ( Matthew 5 : 48 ) Opus Dei also teaches that sanctity is within the reach of everyone , not just a few special individuals , given Jesus ' teaching that his demands are " easy " and " light , " as his divine assistance is assured . ( Matthew 11 : 28 – 30 ) 
 Opus Dei does not have monks or nuns , and only a minority of its members are priests . Opus Dei emphasizes uniting spiritual life with professional , social , and family life . Members of Opus Dei lead ordinary lives , with traditional families and secular careers , and strive to " sanctify ordinary life " . Indeed , Pope John Paul II called Escrivá " the saint of ordinary life " . 
 Similarly , Opus Dei stresses the importance of work and professional competence . While some religious institutes encourage their members to withdraw from the material world , Opus Dei exhorts its members and all lay Catholics to " find God in daily life " and to perform their work excellently as a service to society and as a fitting offering to God . Opus Dei teaches that work not only contributes to social progress but is " a path to holiness " , and its founder advised people to : " Sanctify your work . Sanctify yourself in your work . Sanctify others through your work . " 
 The biblical roots of this Catholic doctrine , according to the founder , are in the phrase " God created man to work " ( Gen 2 : 15 ) and Jesus 's long life as an ordinary carpenter in a small town . Escrivá , who stressed the Christian 's duty to follow Christ 's example , also points to the gospel account that Jesus " has done everything well " ( Mk 7 : 37 ) . 
 The foundation of the Christian life , stressed Escrivá , is divine filiation : Christians are children of God , identified with Christ 's life and mission . Other main features of Opus Dei , according to its official literature , are : freedom , respecting choice and taking personal responsibility ; and charity , love of God above all and love of others . 
 At the bottom of Escrivá 's understanding of the " universal call to holiness " are two dimensions , subjective and objective , according to Fernando <unk> , a Catholic theologian and Vicar General of Opus Dei . The subjective is the call given to each person to become a saint , regardless of his place in society . The objective refers to what Escrivá calls Christian materialism : all of creation , even the most material situation , is a meeting place with God , and leads to union with Him . 
 Different qualifiers have been used to describe Opus Dei 's doctrine : radical , reactionary , faithful , revolutionary , ultraconservative , most modern , <unk> and liberal . 
 = = = Prayers = = = 
 All members – whether married or unmarried , priests or laypeople – are trained to follow a ' plan of life ' , or ' the norms of piety ' , which are some traditional Catholic devotions . This is meant to follow the teaching of the Catholic Catechism : " pray at specific times ... to nourish continual prayer , " which in turn is based on Jesus ' " pray at all times " ( Luke 18 : 1 ) , echoed by St. Paul 's " pray without ceasing " ( 1 Thessalonians 5 : 17 ) . According to Escriva , the vocation to Opus Dei is a calling to be a " contemplative in the middle of the world , " who converts work and daily life into prayer . 
 Daily norms : 
 Heroic minute , waking up punctually and saying " <unk> ! " ( Latin : I will serve ) 
 Morning offering , fixing one 's intentions to do everything for the glory of God 
 Spiritual reading and reading the New Testament , a practice recommended by St. Paul and other saints 
 Mental prayer , conversation with God 
 Mass , Communion and Thanksgiving after Communion 
 Rosary , a traditional Catholic devotion to Christ and to Mary 
 The <unk> ( the common prayer of Opus Dei ) 
 Angelus , a Marian prayer which recalls Christian belief in God 's becoming man 
 <unk> prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary offered for the Opus Dei member in most need at that exact moment 
 Visit to the Blessed Sacrament , a Catholic practice of greeting Jesus in the Eucharist 
 Examination of conscience at the end of the day 
 Three Hail Marys before bed to pray for the virtue of purity 
 Short , spontaneous prayers throughout the day , offering up to God one 's work , sufferings etc . 
 Weekly norms : 
 Confession , in pursuit of the Catholic recommendation on frequent confession 
 a group meeting of spiritual formation ( " the Circle " ) 
 the praying of a Marian antiphon on Saturdays 
 making Psalm 2 the basis of mental prayer on Tuesdays 
 making the <unk> te devote the basis of mental prayer on Thursdays 
 Additionally , members should participate yearly in a spiritual retreat ; a three @-@ week seminar every year is obligatory for numeraries , and a one @-@ week seminar for supernumeraries . Also members are expected to make a day @-@ trip pilgrimage where they recite 3 5 @-@ decade rosaries on the month of May in honour of Mary . 
 = = = Mortification = = = 
 Much public attention has focused on Opus Dei 's practice of mortification — the voluntary offering up of discomfort or pain to God ; this includes fasting , or in some circumstances self @-@ inflicted pain such as self @-@ flagellation . Mortification has a long history in many world religions , including the Catholic Church . It has been endorsed by Popes as a way of following Christ , who died in a bloody crucifixion and who gave this advice : " let him deny himself , take up his cross daily and follow me . " ( <unk> 9 : 23 ) Supporters say that opposition to mortification is rooted in having lost ( 1 ) the " sense of the enormity of sin " or offense against God , and the consequent penance , both interior and exterior , ( 2 ) the notions of " wounded human nature " and of <unk> or inclination to sin , and thus the need for " spiritual battle , " and ( 3 ) a spirit of sacrifice for love and " supernatural ends , " and not only for physical enhancement . 
 As a spirituality for ordinary people , Opus Dei focuses on performing sacrifices pertaining to normal duties and to its emphasis on charity and cheerfulness . Additionally , Opus Dei celibate members practise " corporal <unk> " such as sleeping without a pillow or sleeping on the floor , fasting or remaining silent for certain hours during the day . 
 = = Organization and activities = = 
 = = = Governance = = = 
 In Pope John Paul II 's 1982 decree known as the Apostolic constitution Ut Sit , Opus Dei was established as a personal prelature , a new official structure of the Catholic Church , similar to a diocese in that it contains lay people and secular priests who are led by a bishop . However , whereas a bishop normally has a territory or diocese , the prelate of Opus Dei is pastor to the members and priests of Opus Dei worldwide , no matter what diocese they are in . To date , Opus Dei is the only personal prelature in existence . In addition to being governed by Ut Sit and by the Catholic Church 's general law , Opus Dei is governed by the Church 's Particular Law concerning Opus Dei , otherwise known as Opus Dei 's statutes . This specifies the objectives and workings of the prelature . The prelature is under the Congregation for Bishops . 
 The head of the Opus Dei prelature is known as the Prelate . The Prelate is the primary governing authority and is assisted by two councils — the General Council ( made up of men ) and the Central Advisory ( made up of women ) . The Prelate holds his position for life . The current prelate of Opus Dei is Javier Echevarría Rodríguez , who became the second Prelate of Opus Dei in 1994 . The first Prelate of Opus Dei was Álvaro del Portillo , who held the position from 1982 until his death in 1994 . 
 Opus Dei 's highest assembled bodies are the General Congresses , which are usually convened once every eight years . There are separate congresses for the men and women 's branch of Opus Dei . The General Congresses are made up of members appointed by the Prelate , and are responsible for advising him about the prelature 's future . The men 's General Congress also elects the Prelate from a list of candidates chosen by their female counterparts . After the death of a Prelate , a special elective General Congress is convened . The women nominate their preferred candidates for the prelate and is voted upon by the men to become the next Prelate — an appointment that must be confirmed by the Pope . 
 = = = Membership = = = 
 Based on the language of Catholic Church law and theology , the prelature calls the people under the pastoral care of the prelate as " faithful of the prelature " , since the term member connotes an association rather than a hierarchical structure such as a prelature or a diocese . 
 As of 2015 , the faithful of the Opus Dei Prelature numbered 93 @,@ 986 of which 91 @,@ 892 are lay persons , men and women , and <unk> priests . These figures do not include the priest members of Opus Dei 's Priestly Society of the Holy Cross , estimated to number 2 @,@ 000 in the year 2005 . 
 About 60 per cent of Opus Dei faithful reside in Europe , and 35 per cent reside in the Americas . According to the study of John Allen , for the most part , Opus Dei faithful belong to the middle to low levels in society , in terms of education , income , and social status . 
 Opus Dei is made up of several different types of faithful : 
 <unk> , the largest type , currently account for about 70 % of the total membership . Typically , supernumeraries are married men and women with careers . <unk> devote a portion of their day to prayer , in addition to attending regular meetings and taking part in activities such as retreats . Due to their career and family obligations , supernumeraries are not as available to the organisation as the other types of faithful , but they typically contribute financially to Opus Dei , and they lend other types of assistance as their circumstances permit . 
 Numeraries , the second largest type of the faithful of Opus Dei , comprise about 20 % of total membership . Numeraries are celibate members who usually live in special centers run by Opus Dei . Both men and women may become numeraries , although the centers are strictly gender @-@ segregated . Numeraries generally have careers and devote the bulk of their income to the organisation . 
 <unk> assistants are unmarried , celibate female faithful of Opus Dei . They live in special centres run by Opus Dei but do not have jobs outside the centres — instead , their professional life is dedicated to looking after the domestic needs of the centers and their residents . 
 Associates are unmarried , celibate faithful who typically have family or professional obligations . Unlike numeraries and <unk> assistants , the associates do not live in Opus Dei centres . 
 The Clergy of the Opus Dei Prelature are priests who are under the jurisdiction of the Prelate of Opus Dei . They are a minority in Opus Dei — only about 2 % of Opus Dei members are part of the clergy . Typically , they are numeraries or associates who ultimately joined the priesthood . 
 The Priestly Society of the Holy Cross consists of priests associated with Opus Dei . Part of the society is made up of the clergy of the Opus Dei prelature — priests who fall under the jurisdiction of the Opus Dei prelature are automatically members of the Priestly Society . Other members in the society are diocesan priests — clergymen who remain under the jurisdiction of a geographically defined diocese . These priests are considered full members of Opus Dei who are given its spiritual training . They do not however report to the Opus Dei Prelate but to their own diocesan bishop . As of 2005 , there were roughly two thousand of these priests . 
 The <unk> of Opus Dei are non @-@ members who collaborate in some way with Opus Dei — usually through praying , charitable contributions , or by providing some other assistance . <unk> are not required to be celibate or to adhere to any other special requirements . Indeed , cooperators are not even required to be Christian . There were 164 @,@ 000 cooperators in the year 2005 . 
 In accordance with Catholic theology , membership is granted when a vocation , or divine calling is presumed to have occurred . 
 = = = Activities = = = 
 Leaders of Opus Dei describe the organization as a teaching entity whose main activity is to train Catholics to assume personal responsibility in sanctifying the secular world from within . This teaching is done by means of theory and practice . 
 Its lay people and priests organize seminars , workshops , retreats , and classes to help people put the Christian faith into practice in their daily lives . Spiritual direction , one @-@ on @-@ one coaching with a more experienced lay person or priest , is considered the " paramount means " of training . Through these activities they provide religious instruction ( doctrinal formation ) , coaching in spirituality for lay people ( spiritual formation ) , character and moral education ( human formation ) , lessons in sanctifying one 's work ( professional formation ) , and know @-@ how in evangelizing one 's family and workplace ( apostolic formation ) . 
 The official Catholic document which established the prelature states that Opus Dei strives " to put into practice the teaching of the universal call to sanctity , and to promote at all levels of society the sanctification of ordinary work , and by means of ordinary work . " Thus , the founder and his followers describe members of Opus Dei as resembling the members of the early Christian Church — ordinary workers who seriously sought holiness with nothing exterior to distinguish them from other citizens . 
 Opus Dei runs residential centres throughout the world . These centers provide residential housing for celibate members , and provide doctrinal and theological education . Opus Dei is also responsible for a variety of non @-@ profit institutions called " Corporate Works of Opus Dei " . A study of the year 2005 , showed that members have cooperated with other people in setting up a total of 608 social initiatives : schools and university residences ( 68 % ) , technical or agricultural training centres ( 26 % ) , universities , business schools and hospitals ( 6 % ) . The University of Navarra in Pamplona , Spain is a corporate work of Opus Dei which has been rated as one of the top private universities in the country , while its business school , <unk> , was adjudged one of the best in the world by the Financial Times and the Economist Intelligence Unit . The total assets of non @-@ profits connected to Opus Dei are worth at least $ 2 @.@ 8 billion . 
 = = Relations with Catholic leaders = = 
 Leopoldo <unk> y Garay , the bishop of Madrid where Opus Dei was born , supported Opus Dei and defended it in the 1940s by saying that " this opus is truly Dei " ( this work is truly God 's ) . Contrary to attacks of secrecy and heresy , the bishop described Opus Dei 's founder as someone who is " open as a child " and " most obedient to the Church hierarchy . " 
 In the 1950s , Pope Pius XII told the most senior Australian bishop , Cardinal Norman Gilroy that Escriva " is a true saint , a man sent by God for our times " . Pius XII gave Opus Dei the canonical status of " pontifical right " , an institution depending directly and exclusively on the Vatican in its internal governance . 
 In 1960 , Pope John XXIII commented that Opus Dei opens up " unsuspected horizons of apostolate " . Furthermore , in 1964 , Pope Paul VI praised the organization in a handwritten letter to Escrivá , saying : 
 Opus Dei is " a vigorous expression of the perennial youth of the Church , fully open to the demands of a modern apostolate ... We look with paternal satisfaction on all that Opus Dei has achieved and is achieving for the kingdom of God , the desire of doing good that guides it , the burning love for the Church and its visible head that distinguishes it , and the ardent zeal for souls that impels it along the arduous and difficult paths of the apostolate of presence and witness in every sector of contemporary life . " 
 The relationship between Paul VI and Opus Dei , according to Alberto Moncada , a doctor of sociology and ex @-@ member , was " stormy " . After the Second Vatican Council concluded in 1965 , Pope Paul VI denied Opus Dei 's petition to become a personal prelature , Moncada stated . 
 Pope John Paul I , a few years before his election , wrote that Escrivá was more radical than other saints who taught about the universal call to holiness . While others emphasized monastic spirituality applied to lay people , for Escrivá " it is the material work itself which must be turned into prayer and sanctity " , thus providing a lay spirituality . 
 Criticisms against Opus Dei have prompted Catholics like Piers Paul Read and Vittorio Messori to call Opus Dei a sign of contradiction , in reference to the biblical quote of Jesus as a " sign that is spoken against . " Said John Carmel Heenan , Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster : " One of the proofs of God 's favour is to be a sign of contradiction . Almost all founders of societies in the Church have suffered . Monsignor Escrivá de Balaguer is no exception . Opus Dei has been attacked and its motives misunderstood . In this country and elsewhere an inquiry has always vindicated Opus Dei . " 
 One of Opus Dei 's most prominent supporters was Pope John Paul II . John Paul II cited Opus Dei 's aim of sanctifying secular activities as a " great ideal . " He emphasized that Escrivá 's founding of Opus Dei was ductus divina <unk> , led by divine inspiration , and he granted the organisation its status as a personal prelature . Stating that Escrivá is " counted among the great witnesses of Christianity , " John Paul II canonized him in 2002 , and called him " the saint of ordinary life . " Of the organisation , John Paul II said : 
 " [ Opus Dei ] has as its aim the sanctification of one 's life , while remaining within the world at one 's place of work and profession : to live the Gospel in the world , while living immersed in the world , but in order to transform it , and to redeem it with one 's personal love for Christ . This is truly a great ideal , which right from the beginning has anticipated the theology of the lay state of the Second Vatican Council and the post @-@ conciliar period . " 
 One @-@ third of the world 's bishops petitioned for the canonisation of Escrivá . During the canonisation , there were 42 cardinals and 470 bishops from around the world , generals superior of many religious institutes , and representatives of various Catholic groups . During those days , these Church officials commented on the universal reach and validity of the message of the founder . For his canonisation homily , John Paul II said : With the teachings of St. Josemaría , " it is easier to understand what the Second Vatican Council affirmed : ' there is no question , then , of the Christian message inhibiting men from building up the world ... on the contrary it is an incentive to do these very things ' ( Vatican II , Gaudium et spes , n . 34 ) . " 
 Concerning the group 's role in the Catholic Church , critics have argued that Opus Dei 's unique status as a personal prelature gives it too much independence , making it essentially a " church within a church " and that Opus Dei exerts a disproportionately large influence within the Catholic Church itself , as illustrated , for example , by the unusually rapid canonisation of Escrivá , which some considered to be irregular . In contrast , Catholic officials say that Church authorities have even greater control of Opus Dei now that its head is a prelate appointed by the Pope , and its status as a prelature " precisely means dependence . " Allen says that Escriva 's relatively quick canonization does not have anything to do with power but with improvements in procedures and John Paul II 's decision to make Escriva 's sanctity and message known . 
 Pope Benedict XVI has been a particularly strong supporter of Opus Dei and of Escrivá . Pointing to the name " Work of God " , Benedict XVI ( then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ) , wrote that " The Lord simply made use of [ Escrivá ] who allowed God to work . " Ratzinger cited Escrivá for correcting the mistaken idea that holiness is reserved to some extraordinary people who are completely different from ordinary sinners : Even if he can be very weak , with many mistakes in his life , a saint is nothing other than to speak with God as a friend speaks with a friend , allowing God to work , the Only One who can really make the world both good and happy . 
 Ratzinger spoke of Opus Dei 's " surprising union of absolute fidelity to the Church 's great tradition , to its faith , and unconditional openness to all the challenges of this world , whether in the academic world , in the field of work , or in matters of the economy , etc . " He further explained : 
 " the <unk> of Escrivá ... means this confidence in the fact that God is working now and we ought only to put ourselves at his disposal ... This , for me , is a message of greatest importance . It is a message that leads to overcoming what could be considered the great temptation of our times : the pretense that after the ' Big Bang ' God retired from history . " 
 Pope Francis is " the first Pope who has dealt with Opus Dei closely as a bishop " , and according to James V. Schall , S.J. , is a " friend of Opus Dei . " Francis referred to St. Josemaria as " a precursor of Vatican II in proposing the universal call to holiness . " In the analysis of John Allen , Pope Francis ' strong dislike for clericalism , which he calls " one of the worst evils " in the Church is a key factor for " what Francis admires about Opus Dei , since Escrivá ’ s emphasis on the dignity of the laity was a challenge to the ultra @-@ clerical ethos of Spanish Catholicism in the late 1920s . " He has a devotion to St. Josemaria , and he prayed before his relics for 45 minutes , when he once visited the church of the prelature in Rome . Francis beatified Alvaro del Portillo , the successor of Escriva . What <unk> most liked about Opus Dei was the work done for the poor by one of its schools in Buenos Aires . He thanks Opus Dei for its work to further the holiness of priests in the Roman Curia . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 Throughout its history , Opus Dei has been criticized from many quarters , prompting journalists to describe Opus Dei as " the most controversial force in the Catholic Church " and founder Saint Josemaría Escrivá as a " polarizing " figure . 
 The organisation has been criticized for issues relating to the Catholic Church , especially the practice of mortification of the flesh . Controversies about Opus Dei have centered around criticisms of its behaviours , such as alleged secretiveness , aggressive recruiting methods , and its strict rules governing members . The organization 's members have also been categorized by critics as right @-@ leaning elitists , with some individuals supporting fascist governments , such as the Francoist Government of Spain until 1978 . 
 = = = Supporting views = = = 
 According to several journalists who have worked independently on Opus Dei , such as John Allen , Jr . , Vittorio Messori , Patrice de Plunkett , <unk> Whitehouse , Noam Friedlander many of the criticisms against Opus Dei are myths and unproven tales . Allen , Messori , and Plunkett say that most of these myths were created by its opponents , with Allen adding that he perceives that Opus Dei members generally practise what they preach . 
 Allen , Messori , and Plunkett also state that accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded . These accusations stem from a clerical paradigm which expects Opus Dei members to behave as monks and clerics , people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness . In contrast , these journalists continue , Opus Dei 's lay members , like any normal Catholic professional , are ultimately responsible for their personal actions , and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education . Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen , Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself . These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei can be found in influential clerical circles . 
 As to its alleged participation in right @-@ wing politics , especially the Francoist regime , British historians Paul Preston and Brian Crozier state that the Opus Dei members who were Franco 's ministers were appointed for their talent and not for their Opus Dei membership . Also , there were notable members of Opus Dei who were vocal critics of the Franco Regime such as Rafael Calvo Serer and Antonio Fontán , who was the first President of the Senate in Spain , following the adoption of a democratic Constitution . The German historian and Opus Dei member Peter <unk> calls any connection made between Opus Dei and Franco 's regime a " gross slander . " At the end of Franco 's regime , Opus Dei members were 50 : 50 for and against Franco , according to John Allen . Similarly Álvaro del Portillo , the former Prelate of Opus Dei , said that any statements that Escrivá supported Hitler were " a patent falsehood , " that were part of " a slanderous campaign " . He and others have stated that Escriva condemned Hitler as a " rogue " , a " racist " and a " tyrant " . Opus Dei spokespersons also deny claims that Opus Dei members worked with General Pinochet . Various authors state that Escriva was staunchly non @-@ political , and detested dictatorships . Allen wrote that , compared with other Catholic organizations , Opus Dei 's stress on freedom and personal responsibility is extraordinarily strong . There are many Opus Dei members who are identified with left @-@ wing politics , including Ruth Kelly , Jorge Rossi <unk> and Jesus Estanislao . 
 While Opus Dei spokespersons have admitted mistakes in dealing with some members and do not , as a rule , contest their grievances , supporters have rejected generalisations merely based on negative experiences of some members . Sociologists like Bryan R. Wilson write about some former members of any religious group who may have psychological motivations such as self @-@ justification to criticise their former groups . Wilson states that such individuals are prone to create fictitious " atrocity stories " which have no basis in reality . Many supporters of Opus Dei have expressed the belief that the criticisms of Opus Dei stem from a generalised disapproval of spirituality , Christianity , or Catholicism . Expressing this sentiment , one Opus Dei member , Cardinal Julián Herranz , stated " Opus Dei has become a victim of <unk> . " Massimo Introvigne , author of an encyclopedia of religion , argues that critics employ the term " cult " in order to intentionally stigmatize Opus Dei because " they could not tolerate ' the return to religion ' of the secularized society " . 
 Opus Dei is not " elitist " in the sense in which people often invoke the term , meaning an exclusively white @-@ collar phenomenon , concluded John Allen . He observed that among its members are barbers , bricklayers , mechanics and fruit sellers . Most supernumeraries are living ordinary middle @-@ class lives , he said . 
 Regarding alleged misogyny , John Allen states that half of the leadership positions in Opus Dei are held by women , and they supervise men . The Catholic Church defends its male priesthood by saying that " the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven are not the ministers but the saints . " 
 = = = Critical views = = = 
 In the English @-@ speaking world there is an internet @-@ based blogging website called the Opus Dei Awareness Network ( <unk> ) whose Web page is sub @-@ headed " Bringing light to Opus Dei 's Questionable Practices " . Critics of Opus Dei include María del Carmen Tapia , an ex @-@ member who was a high @-@ ranking officer of Opus Dei for many years , liberal Catholic theologians such as Fr . James Martin , a Jesuit writer and editor , and supporters of Liberation theology , such as journalist Penny <unk> and Michael Walsh , a writer on religious matters and former Jesuit . 
 Critics state that Opus Dei is " intensely secretive " — for example , members generally do not disclose their affiliation with Opus Dei in public . Further , under the 1950 constitution , members were expressly forbidden to reveal themselves without the permission of their superiors . This practice has led to much speculation about who may be a member . 
 Opus Dei has been accused of deceptive and aggressive recruitment practices such as showering potential members with intense praise ( " Love bombing " ) , and instructing numeraries to form friendships and attend social gatherings explicitly for recruiting purposes . 
 Critics allege that Opus Dei maintains an extremely high degree of control over its members — for instance , past rules required numeraries to submit their incoming and outgoing mail to their superiors for inspection , and members are forbidden to read certain books without permission from their superiors . Critics charge that Opus Dei pressures numeraries to sever contact with non @-@ members , including their own families . Exit counselor David Clark has described Opus Dei as " very cult @-@ like " . 
 Critics assert that Escrivá and the organisation supported radical right @-@ wing governments , such as those of Franco , Augusto Pinochet and Alberto Fujimori of Peru during the 1990s . Both Pinochet 's and Fujimori 's ministries and prominent supporters allegedly included members of Opus Dei , but there are also prominent Opus Dei members in parties that opposed those governments . Likewise , among Opus Dei members there were also strong detractors of Franco , such as Antonio Fontán . There have also been allegations that Escrivá expressed sympathy for Adolf Hitler . One former Opus Dei priest , Vladimir <unk> , who has become a vocal Opus Dei critic , says that Escrivá once remarked that Hitler had been " badly treated " by the world and he further declared that " Hitler couldn 't have been such a bad person . He couldn 't have killed six million [ Jews ] . It couldn 't have been more than four million . " 
 Opus Dei has also been accused of elitism through targeting of " the intellectual elite , the well @-@ to @-@ do , and the socially prominent . " 
 As a part of the Roman Catholic Church , Opus Dei has been open to the same criticisms as Catholicism in general — for example female members of Opus Dei cannot become priests or prelates . Specifically , Opus Dei 's position has been " to oppose sexual freedoms and promote conservative morals , " according to an investigative report produced by the advocacy group Catholics for Choice The report further cites a study from sociologist Marco Burgos alleging Opus Dei interference in sex education programs in Honduras . 
 After conducting a critical study of Opus Dei , journalist John L. Allen , Jr. concluded that Opus Dei should ( 1 ) be more transparent , ( 2 ) collaborate with members of religious institutes , and ( 3 ) encourage its members to air out in public their criticisms of the institution . 
 = = = Other views = = = 
 Sociologists Peter Berger and Samuel Huntington suggest that Opus Dei is involved in " a deliberate attempt to construct an alternative modernity , " one that engages modern culture while at the same time is resolutely loyal to Catholic traditions . Van <unk> of Time magazine emphasises Opus Dei 's Spanish roots as a source of misunderstandings in the Anglo @-@ Saxon world , and suggests that as the United States becomes more Hispanic , controversies about Opus Dei ( and similar Catholic organizations ) will decrease . 
 In her 2006 book on Opus Dei , <unk> Whitehouse , a non @-@ Catholic journalist , argues that the relative autonomy of each director and centre has resulted in mistakes at the local level . She recommends greater consistency and transparency for Opus Dei , which she sees as having learned the lesson of greater openness when it faced the issues raised by The Da Vinci Code and other critics .

 Jerry Pournelle 's 1974 Science Fiction story " Enforcer " centers on a fictional coup d 'état in Argentina , whose moving spirit , a Colonel Ortiz , is affiliated to Opus Dei as well as Catholic Action . Though he is the story 's antagonist , <unk> is depicted rather sympathetically as an honest and dedicated officer - who tries ( and eventually fails ) to defend Argentine sovereignty against a giant multi @-@ national corporation employing the " Enforcer " of the title . 
 In the 1997 novel The Genesis Code by John Case the leader of Umbra Domini , which is the author 's version of Opus Dei , is portrayed as the novel 's antagonist . In the novel , Umbra Domini members are sent on a mission to execute children who were conceived using genetically engineered oocytes . 
 In another 1997 book , the detective novel " The Death of Faith " which is the seventh in the <unk> Brunetti series by Donna Leon , the book 's mystery turns out to involve sinister activities by Opus Dei . The book ends with the protagonist Brunetti feeling certain that a priest who is an Opus Dei member was responsible for several murders - but has no way to prove it in court , and feels that Opus Dei is too powerful to touch . 
 Since 2003 , Opus Dei has received world attention as a result of Dan Brown 's novel The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the novel . In The Da Vinci Code , Opus Dei is portrayed as a Catholic organization that is led into a sinister international conspiracy . In general , The Da Vinci Code has been sharply criticised for its numerous factual inaccuracies , by a wide array of scholars and historians . According to the Anglican Bishop of Durham , the Rt Rev Dr Tom Wright , the novel is a " great thriller " but " lousy history " . For example , Silas , a major villain in The Da Vinci Code is a monk who is a member of Opus Dei — but in reality there are no monks in Opus Dei . The Da Vinci Code implies that Opus Dei is the Pope 's personal prelature — but the term " personal prelature " does not refer to a special relationship to the Pope : It means an institution in which the jurisdiction of the prelate is not linked to a geographic territory but over persons , wherever they be . Nonetheless , Brown stated that his portrayal of Opus Dei was based on interviews with members and ex @-@ members , and books about Opus Dei . An Opus Dei spokesman questioned this statement . 
 A Franco @-@ Belgian comic book ( bande dessinée ) on the life of Escrivá was published by <unk> BD in 2005 . The title is Through the mountains , in reference to Escriva 's escape from the Republican zone through the mountains of Andorra during the Spanish Civil War . 
 In the bestselling Ashwin <unk> thriller The <unk> Line ( 2007 ) , mention of Opus Dei and Illuminati are frequent . <unk> , often termed the Indian Dan Brown , created an intricate plot revolving around themes of Jesus ' tomb and nuclear bombs and the events , though global , have India as an important theatre . 
 Camino , a 2008 Spanish film directed by Javier <unk> , allegedly based on the real story of Alexia González @-@ Barros , a girl who died from spinal cancer at fourteen in 1985 and awaits canonisation . <unk> portrays the Opus Dei in a negative way , depicting it as an extreme cult destroying families , suggesting that Opus Dei manipulated the tragedy of the young Camino 's painful death for its own ends . 
 There Be Dragons , an historical epic film released in the spring of 2011 , includes the early life of Escrivá . It is directed by Roland Joffé , and stars Charlie Cox , Wes Bentley , Derek Jacobi , Golshifteh Farahani , Dougray Scott , Olga Kurylenko , and Lily Cole .

 John Alan Coey ( 12 November 1950 – 19 July 1975 ) was an American soldier who served in the Rhodesian Army as one of " the Crippled Eagles " , a loosely organised group of US expatriates fighting for the unrecognised government of Rhodesia ( today Zimbabwe ) during that country 's Bush War . A devout Christian and fervent anti @-@ communist — the African @-@ American historian Gerald Horne described him as a white supremacist of the political ultra @-@ right — he was the first American fatality of the war . He moved to Rhodesia to join its army in 1972 , the day after graduating from college in his home town of Columbus , Ohio , and served until he was killed in action in 1975 . He kept a journal throughout his service that was posthumously published as A Martyr Speaks . 
 Coey received United States Marine Corps officer training during his studies and was on track to receive a commission when he requested discharge and left for Rhodesia , asserting that the US government had been infiltrated by a " revolutionary conspiracy of internationalists , collectivists and communists " and that fighting for Rhodesia would allow him to better defend Western interests . He joined the Rhodesian Special Air Service ( SAS ) and passed out with the rank of trooper in November 1972 , receiving recognition as one of the army 's best recruits of the year . However , his political views led to an acrimonious fall from favour within the SAS , his expulsion from its officer training programme in October 1973 and ultimately to his leaving the unit four months later . He redeployed to the Rhodesian Army Medical Corps , from which he was posted to the Rhodesian Light Infantry ( RLI ) heliborne commando battalion in July 1974 , concurrently with his promotion to corporal . He thereafter served an instructor and commando medic in the RLI . 
 Though not an officer , Coey exerted some influence on tactical doctrine , making numerous suggestions to his superiors and pioneering the combat medic role in the Rhodesian Army , which caused him to be nicknamed " the Fighting Doc " . He was killed in action in the <unk> Tribal Trust Lands in the country 's north on 19 July 1975 , shot through the head while running into the open to treat two fallen comrades . His remains , originally buried in Que Que in central Rhodesia , were reinterred in Ohio in 1979 . His journal and some of his letters home were compiled into A Martyr Speaks by his mother soon after he died , and published in 1988 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Alan Coey was born in Columbus , Ohio , on 12 November 1950 to George and Phyllis Coey , both devout Christians . While growing up , John was a keen Boy Scout and attained the organisation 's top rank , Eagle Scout . He attended Ohio State University 's campus in his home town , studying forestry , and during his studies enlisted in the United States Marine Corps ' officer training program as a cadet in its Platoon Leaders Class . During this time he also taught at a local Sunday school . 
 Like his parents , Coey was a fervent Christian , and held forthright views on communism , which he believed was an inherently evil system of government , geared towards the ultimate destruction of Christianity and the West ; he later wrote of the " murder " of 65 million people by communists in China and the Soviet Union since the October Revolution of 1917 , " and the souls of millions more ... indoctrinated with atheism " . In Coey 's opinion , only the retention of a society rooted in traditional Western culture and Christian faith would prevent this from happening elsewhere . 
 = = Military career = = 
 = = = Motivations = = = 
 Coey was on track to receive an officer 's commission into the Marines as soon as he graduated from college , but he became severely disillusioned by the course of the Vietnam War . Puzzled by America 's failure to win the war , he developed a theory that the United States government had been infiltrated by a " revolutionary conspiracy of internationalists , collectivists and communists " , which he claimed was deliberately bringing about defeat in Vietnam to demoralise Americans as a precursor to bringing the United States under a totalitarian world government . His attention was caught by the situation in Rhodesia ( today Zimbabwe ) , where a war pitted the unrecognised government , made up predominantly of the country 's minority whites , against communist @-@ backed black nationalist guerrilla groups . Coey interpreted this as Rhodesia " holding the line " on the behalf of Christendom against communism , and surmised that he would better serve the United States and the Western world if he fought in the Rhodesian Army rather than the US Marine Corps . He successfully requested a discharge from the Marines just before he would have received his commission , and flew to southern Africa the day after he graduated from Ohio State in late March 1972 to join the Rhodesian Army . 
 Foreigners like Coey who volunteered for the Rhodesian Army received the same pay and conditions of service as local regulars . Ideologically and religiously motivated , Coey viewed himself as a kind of latter @-@ day crusader . He kept a thorough journal of his thoughts and experiences throughout his army service . " I believe God intended me to come here for some purpose , " he wrote soon after enlisting . " This action has cost me an Officer 's Commission , and ... my citizenship may be revoked , [ but ] this is the most I can do for my country under the circumstances . " He told the historian Gerald Horne that he believed communists had already compromised top levels of the US government , and that by serving in Rhodesia he was helping to unify " his people " against a foreign conspiracy . His religious views also affected his views on Zionism : he believed that the State of Israel 's existence prior to the Second Coming of Christ was contrary to scriptural prophecies , and that it should therefore be destroyed . 
 = = = Special Air Service = = = 
 Though foreign soldiers in the Rhodesian Army were only required to immediately commit to three years ' service , Coey volunteered on arrival for at least five . He joined the Special Air Service ( SAS ) , an elite commando unit . He was one of several foreigners in his barrack room , and they decorated their quarters with the flags of their home countries . Coey performed well during his initial training , and was recognised as one of the Rhodesian Army 's top recruits of 1972 ; after passing out in November that year with the rank of trooper , he was picked out in January 1973 for instruction as an officer . While training for this new role , he contributed articles to various Rhodesian and South African publications , sending work to the latter under the Afrikaans pseudonym " Johann Coetzee " . The political and religious views reflected in his journal continued : on 18 September 1973 , he expressed profound joy at the overthrow of Chile 's Marxist President Salvador Allende , and painted the incident as a victory for Christianity and the West . 
 In October 1973 , Coey submitted an inflammatory article detailing his views on America 's foreign policy to the army magazine , <unk> ; the firmly anti @-@ establishment piece , " The Myth of American Anti @-@ communism " , was deemed " subversive " by the army , which blocked its publication . Coey was removed from the officer training programme soon after , officially because of his " temperament " . Though disappointed by his expulsion , and suspicious about the true reasoning behind it , Coey did not complain , writing that as an ordinary trooper he would be free to broadcast his views to the public unhindered . 
 Coey first saw combat action in November 1973 , in a covert external operation in Portuguese Mozambique 's north @-@ western Tete Province . He enjoyed it , comparing the experience to the American Indian Wars of the 19th century . The following month , however , he was informed by his commanding officer that he would be not be used as a paratrooper , and would not be going on patrol again , as he was , in the commander 's words , " not worth it " . Coey felt so humiliated that he considered leaving , but resolved to stay and fight on . Despite his commander 's order to remain on base , he joined a patrol into Mozambique and crossed the border on 7 January 1974 . The commanding officer flew into a rage when he discovered Coey 's insubordination two weeks later , and immediately had him brought back . Meanwhile , Coey persevered with " The Myth of American Anti @-@ communism " , and secured its publication in the conservative , nationally distributed journal Property and Finance on 7 February 1974 . Five days later , he was barred from taking part in a parachute exercise with his unit , and on 14 February he was instructed to choose another army corps or regiment by the 18th ; the SAS no longer wanted him . 
 = = = Rhodesian Light Infantry = = = 
 Coey 's request to transfer to the Rhodesian Army Medical Corps was granted , and he was accordingly placed in a three @-@ month medical course in Bulawayo , starting in April 1974 . On its completion in July , he was promoted to corporal and posted to the Rhodesian Light Infantry ( RLI ) heliborne commando battalion , where he was installed as an instructor . He expressed pride in teaching " as we did at Quantico — the Marine way ! " He was pleased to meet other Americans in the RLI , particularly when they were fellow US Marines . The American expatriates in the Rhodesian forces tended to try to stay together and associate with each other . They were later informally dubbed " the Crippled Eagles " by the American author Robin Moore , who moved to Salisbury in August 1976 and became their unofficial patron . Coey liked and respected his fellow soldiers , who in turn regarded him as strong , capable and brave , but there was mutual animosity concerning their respective lifestyles while off @-@ duty . " They live for pleasure mostly , " Coey wrote in his journal , " drinking and whoring . The Christian soldier is sometimes despised and ridiculed . " 
 Coey acquitted himself well in the eyes of his superiors following his move to the RLI , and soon after joining the unit mustered into Support Group as a specialist in tracking , mortars and armoured vehicle driving , while also working as a medic . He took part in over 60 Fireforce missions in this capacity , and became nicknamed " the Fighting Doc " because of his vehement insistence on joining such combat excursions . Although his political views had prevented him from becoming an officer , he continued to make tactical suggestions to his superiors , some of which were adopted ; for example , combat medics were introduced to RLI patrols at his suggestion , and following his example . However , other ideas of Coey 's — such as his proposed use of <unk> weapons and the " weapon of starvation " against Mozambicans and <unk> — were less well received . 
 On recovering his journal , Coey 's family discovered that portions of it which discussed army operations in too much detail — sometimes brief passages , but occasionally whole months at a time — had been censored by the army , and in some cases removed entirely . Apart from an entry on 26 December 1974 , in which Coey wrote about his loneliness at Christmas and desire to get married , not a word remained after 11 November 1974 . Having become engaged to a young Rhodesian woman , Coey successfully filed for Rhodesian citizenship while on leave in June 1975 , then renewed his US passport in South Africa . " What a chuckle , " he wrote to a friend , " filling out those papers under a portrait of Henry Kissinger ! "

 On 19 July 1975 , a unit from the Rhodesian Territorial Force ( TF ) contacted a group of guerrillas near a river in the <unk> Tribal Trust Lands , north @-@ east of Mount Darwin in the area covered by Operation Hurricane . After the Territorials killed two of the insurgents without loss , the cadres fell back and set up an ambush position underneath the roots of some overhanging trees on the riverbank . The TF patrol summoned a Fireforce made up of 7 and 10 Troops , 2 Commando , RLI from Mount Darwin , which arrived soon after . Coey , who was attached to 2 Commando at the time , accompanied 7 Troop as the patrol 's combat medic . 
 The <unk> and 10 Troop made a sweep of the river line , but on rounding a bend in the stream were suddenly fired upon by the hidden guerrillas . A sergeant from the TF was killed , as well as Rifleman Hennie <unk> of the RLI . RLI Rifleman Ken Lucas suffered a gunshot wound to the leg . The insurgents now held their fire to prevent giving their position away . Incorrectly believing from the inactivity that the cadres had fled , and thinking that the two fallen soldiers were still alive , Major Hank Meyer ordered the leader of 7 Troop , Lieutenant Joe du Plooy , to sweep around the river and send Coey out to treat the men . 
 Lieutenant du Plooy led his men around the bend , carefully keeping them behind cover , then sent Coey out into the open riverbed to give treatment . With his Red Cross flag clearly visible , Coey came out from cover and made for the bodies on the ground . The concealed cadres immediately opened fire and fatally shot him through the head . His lifeless body fell at du Plooy 's feet . Coey was the first American fatality of the Rhodesian Bush War . The contact in which he died eventually ended with du Plooy and two other Rhodesians being wounded and a further Rhodesian soldier , Corporal Jannie de Beer , being killed . The insurgents escaped without any further loss to their number . 
 = = Reactions to death , funeral and burial = = 
 Coey 's parents received letters of consolation from across the world , including one from Lester Maddox , the segregationist Governor of Georgia , and another from the secretary of the far @-@ right Liberty Lobby . Coey was never a member of any radical political group , but his life and death were still used as propaganda by some such movements : according to The Nation , Coey was " eulogized in the American Nazi paper " , and , on 4 July 1976 , Willis Carto of the Liberty Lobby announced a posthumous award to Coey to commemorate the bicentenary of the United States . Members of the Rhodesian public donated money to help the Coey family travel to Rhodesia to attend his funeral service . On arrival , Coey 's parents told the Salisbury Sunday Mail that they believed his death had not been in vain , as he had fallen defending " the last bastion for fighting communism that is left in the Western world " . 
 On 28 July 1975 , Coey received a full military funeral and was buried in the central Rhodesian town of Que Que , where he had been living . With his parents standing by , Coey 's brother , Edward , gave a eulogy that strongly stressed his family 's religious and ideological beliefs — he said that his brother had achieved " the greatest of Christian virtues : sacrifice " . 
 When the family returned to Ohio , Phyllis Coey compiled her son 's journal and a selection of his letters home into a book entitled A Martyr Speaks , which she first attempted to have published in 1975 . Because of the controversial views it contained ( including Coey 's dedication of his journal " to the 100 @,@ 000 American dead of Korea and Vietnam who were betrayed by their own government " ) , the book was turned down by publishers for over a decade . Coey 's remains were reburied in Ohio in 1979 , near to his family home . A Martyr Speaks was released in 1988 , 13 years after his death , by the New Puritan Library , a religious press in North Carolina .

 State Route 247 ( SR 247 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California in San Bernardino County . The road passes through the Mojave Desert , connecting SR 62 in Yucca Valley to Interstate 15 ( I @-@ 15 ) . SR 247 was designated by the California State Legislature in 1969 ; the county roads along that route were given to the state in 1972 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 247 begins at a junction with SR 62 in the town of Yucca Valley , where it is signed as Old Woman Springs Road . From Yucca Valley , the two @-@ lane highway heads northwestward through desert , much of it through Johnson Valley , briefly passing through Flamingo Heights and the western tip of Landers . 
 In the town of Lucerne Valley , SR 18 and SR 247 do not actually intersect , but the highways are less than 0 @.@ 125 miles ( 0 @.@ 201 km ) apart , connected by a short continuation road to extend SR 18 to SR 247 . A right turn at this intersection changes SR 247 's path due north as Barstow Road towards Barstow and its northern terminus at I @-@ 15 , passing by Barstow Community College . However , continuing straight on Old Woman Springs Road , instead of turning right at this intersection , leads to SR 18 , heading west by northwest to Apple Valley and Victorville . 
 SR 247 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System , but is not part of the National Highway System , a network of highways that are essential to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . The route is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System , but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation . In 2013 , SR 247 had an annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) of 1 @,@ 700 between Stoddard Wells Road and the Barstow city limits , and 18 @,@ 000 at the northern terminus with I @-@ 15 , the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway . 
 = = History = = 
 The California State Legislature defined Route 26 as a route from Lucerne Valley to <unk> Valley in 1959 . SR 247 was designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering as a route from SR 62 in Yucca Valley to SR 18 near Lucerne Valley , and then from there to I @-@ 15 in Barstow . That year , the Lucerne Valley Chamber of Commerce began an effort to have a state highway designated from Lucerne Valley to Yucca Valley along Old Woman Springs Road . By 1969 , county roads had been constructed from Barstow to Lucerne Valley , and from there to Yucca Valley . Barstow Road and Old Woman Springs Road were given to the state by San Bernardino County in 1972 , although the county had agreed to perform some improvements on the two roads after the state began to maintain them . 
 Parts of the SR 247 roadway buckled in the Landers earthquake of 1992 , and 10 miles ( 16 km ) of the highway was closed while repairs took place .

 Tubas has been identified as the ancient town of Thebez / <unk> / — a Canaanite town famous for revolting against King Abimelech . During the late 19th century , during Ottoman rule in Palestine , Arab clans living in the Jordan Valley came to live in Tubas , and it became a major town in the District of Nablus , particularly known for its timber and cheese @-@ making . It came under the British Mandate of Palestine in 1917 , was annexed by Jordan after their capture of the town in the 1948 Arab – Israeli War , and then occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six @-@ Day War . The Palestinian National Authority has had complete control of Tubas since the city was transferred to its jurisdiction in 1995 .

 The city 's name Tubas derives from the Canaanite word Tuba <unk> or " illuminating star " . Tubas was identified by Edward Robinson to be the Canaanite / Israelite town of " Thebez " mentioned in the Bible . Thebez was ruled by the Israelite King Abimelech of Shechem . When the people of Shechem ( at that time a Canaanite city ) revolted against him , Thebez joined the revolt . A Biblical story relates that Abimelech attempted to destroy Thebez in response to its participation in the revolt and when he and his army attacked a tower in the town , a woman hurled a millstone at Abimelech , killing him . 
 Archaeological remains such as cemeteries and olive presses indicate that Tubas was inhabited during the Roman era of rule in Palestine . Jerome mentioned Thebez being 13 Roman miles east of Neapolis ( Nablus ) . Besides the Biblical story , nothing has been known about Thebez before or after the revolt .

 In 1596 it appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as " Tubas " , in the nahiya of Jabal Sami in the <unk> of Nablus . It had a population of 41 households and 16 bachelors , all Muslim . Taxes were paid on wheat , barley , summer crops , olive trees , occasional revenues , goats , beehives , and a press for olives or grapes . 
 In the late 19th century during Ottoman rule in Palestine , groups of Arabs belonging to the Daraghmeh clan — mostly shepherds and farmers who lived in the Jordan Valley — migrated northward to the site because of its fertile ground , proximity to several springs , and its high elevation compared to the Jordan Valley and Wadi al @-@ Far 'a plain ; Mount Gerizim was visible from the area . The Daraghmeh clan had lived in the Jordan Valley since the 15th century and in addition to Tubas , they founded or inhabited the nearby hamlets of <unk> , al @-@ <unk> , Khirbet al @-@ Malih , <unk> , <unk> , and Ras al @-@ Far 'a . Soon after being established in Tubas , Arabs from Najd , Syria , Transjordan , Hebron and nearby Nablus came to settle in the area . During this period , Tubas became the site of clashes between the ' Abd al @-@ Hadi and Tuqan clans of Nablus and suffered incursions by Bedouins from areas east of the city . The Jarrar clan did not inhabit , but administrated Tubas , as it was located within the nahiya ( " subdistrict " ) of <unk> al @-@ Jarrar . 
 Tubas was one of the largest villages in the District of Nablus . Most of the inhabitants resided in mud @-@ built houses or tents in order to work on their distant lands in the Jordan Valley and to graze their sheep and goat flocks . According to traveler Herbert Rix , compared to other towns of its size in Samaria , Tubas was " well @-@ to @-@ do " and had abundant amounts of timber which was harvested for firewood . Tubas , unlike the villages in the rest of the district , depended on livestock and not olives for income . Livestock products included cheese , clarified butter , woolen rugs , tents , ropes , and cloth bags . In 1882 a boys ' school was established in the town . 
 In 1877 Lieutenant Kitchener , of the Palestine Exploration Fund survey team , reported uncovering an Arabic inscription buried in the wall of the village mosque recording its building and dedication . He also wrote that the villagers had paid a bribe of £ 100 in gold to the Pasha of Nablus to avoid their young men being conscripted into the Turkish army fighting in Crimea . He noted that they would probably have to repeat the payment . 
 The Palestine Exploration Fund noted that the Samaritans believed that the tomb of Asher , known locally as Nabi Tota ( " the good prophet " ) , was located in Tubas . The tomb served as a shrine in local Muslim tradition .

 In 1917 , the British captured Palestine from the Ottomans , and in 1922 – 23 Tubas was incorporated into the British Mandate of Palestine . In 1947 , the United Nations drew up a partition plan to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab states ; Tubas and the surrounding villages and hamlets were to be included in the Arab state . During the 1948 Arab – Israeli War , Fawzi al @-@ Qawuqji led 750 Arab Liberation Army ( ALA ) soldiers to Tubas from Transjordan and set up base there ; Tubas would serve as the ALA 's headquarters in central Palestine throughout the war . Transjordan ( became Jordan in April 1949 ) annexed the city along with the entire West Bank , after gaining control of it during the war . In 1955 the first girls ' school was opened . Tubas was under their control until 1967 , when Israel occupied the West Bank during the Six @-@ Day War . 
 Tubas was transferred to Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) control in 1995 under the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . During the Jordanian and Israeli periods , the city was under the administration of the Nablus Governorate , but in 1996 , the PNA declared Tubas and the immediate area to be an electoral district , and later , an independent administrative area — the Tubas Governorate . 
 Tubas did not see as much violence in the Israeli – Palestinian conflict as nearby Nablus and Jenin , but a number of incidents occurred during the Second Intifada , which began in 2000 . In April 2002 , the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) killed six active Hamas members in the town , including Ashraf <unk> Daraghmeh — the chief Hamas commander in Tubas and the surrounding area . On August 31 , 2002 , an Israeli Apache helicopter fired four Hellfire missiles at a civilian car suspected of carrying a local al @-@ Aqsa Martyrs Brigades commander and a nearby home . The strike instead killed five civilians , including two children , two teenagers and a 29 @-@ year @-@ old Fatah activist accused of being a member of the al @-@ Aqsa Brigades . The Israeli Defense Minister , <unk> Ben @-@ Eliezer , issued a statement expressing " regret " over " harming " civilians in Tubas . Ben @-@ Eliezer described the raid in Tubas as a " mistake " , and promised that the army would investigate the incident . On August 21 , 2009 , a clash between the Sawafta clan and another city clan left a member of the former dead and 38 others injured . Five homes were also burnt and Palestinian Security Forces arrested five people in connection to the death .
