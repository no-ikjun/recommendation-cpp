 = Fort Ricasoli = 
 Fort Ricasoli ( Maltese : Forti <unk> ) is a bastioned fort in Kalkara , Malta , which was built by the Order of Saint John between 1670 and 1698 . The fort occupies a promontory known as Gallows ' Point and the north shore of Rinella Bay , commanding the entrance to the Grand Harbour along with Fort Saint Elmo . It is the largest fort in Malta , and it has been on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1998 , as part of the Knights ' Fortifications around the Harbours of Malta . 
 Fort Ricasoli saw use during the French invasion of Malta in 1798 and the subsequent Maltese insurrection , after which it ended up in British hands . Ricasoli was the site of the Froberg mutiny in 1807 , and it was also used as a military hospital during the 19th century . It saw use once again in World War II , when parts of it were destroyed by aerial bombardment . After it was decommissioned in the 1960s , the fort was used for industrial purposes . Today , the fort remains mostly intact but in a dilapidated state , and it is used as a filming location and a tank cleaning facility .

 Fort Ricasoli stands on the easternmost peninsula on the east side of the Grand Harbour . The promontory was originally known as Rinella Point or Punta <unk> . In 1531 , two slaves who had tried to take over Fort St. Angelo were hanged on the peninsula , which became known as Gallows ' Point afterwards . During the Great Siege of Malta in 1565 , the Ottomans built an artillery battery on the peninsula in order to bombard Fort St. Elmo . 
 On 18 January 1629 , the Italian knight Alessandro Orsi financed the construction of a tower on Gallows ' Point . The tower was officially called Torre San Petronio , but it was commonly known as Orsi Tower or Torri <unk> by the locals . The tower was round , and it was built to prevent the escape of slaves from the island . A semi @-@ circular battery , which was known as Orsi Battery or San Petronio Battery , was later built around the tower . The tower and battery were protected by a sea @-@ filled ditch and a drawbridge . They remained standing until they were destroyed by waves in a storm on 8 February 1821 , and today only the rock @-@ hewn ditch of the battery remains . 
 In 1644 , Giovanni de ’ Medici proposed that Fort St. Angelo in Birgu be abandoned and a new fort be constructed on Orsi Point . The new fort would have been also called Fort St. Angelo , and would be manned with the garrison of the old fort . He drew up plans for the proposed fort , but they were never implemented . 
 = = = Construction and modifications = = = 
 In 1669 , fears of an Ottoman attack rose after the fall of Candia , and the following year Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner invited Antonio Maurizio Valperga , the military engineer of the House of Savoy , to improve Malta 's fortifications . Valperga designed a new fort to be built on the headland , and despite some criticism from within the Order , the decision was eventually approved . The Florentine knight Fra Giovanni Francesco Ricasoli donated 20 @,@ 000 scudi to construct the fort , and it was named in his honour . The first stone was laid down on 15 June 1670 , and the initial stages of construction were supervised by Valperga himself . The fort received a skeleton garrison in June 1674 , although it was still incomplete . In 1681 , the Flemish engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh proposed some changes to the design of the fort , and these recommendations were implemented . The barracks , chapel and other buildings within the fort were constructed in the 1680s and 1690s , and the fort was officially declared complete and armed in May 1698 . 
 In 1714 , the French engineers René Jacob de Tigné , Charles François de Mondion and Philippe de Vendôme criticized the small size of the fort 's bastions , which they deemed ineffective . De Tigné proposed a number of alterations , including repairing the existing parapets and embrasures , as well as constructing a retrenchment within the fort . Vendôme proposed the construction of a canal separating the fort from the mainland . In 1722 , the repairs proposed by de Tigné were implemented , although the retrenchment and canal were never built due to a lack of funds . The fort was in a bad state by the mid @-@ 18th century , and some maintenance work was done in 1761 . 
 In 1785 , Ricasoli was armed with eighty cannon , including forty @-@ one 24 @-@ pounders , making it the most heavily armed fort in Malta . Parts of the fort 's enceinte were rebuilt under the direction of Antoine Étienne de Tousard in the 1790s . 
 The fort was also used as a prison prior to the construction of the Corradino Correctional Facility .

 Fort Ricasoli saw use during the French invasion of Malta in June 1798 , during the French Revolutionary Wars . At the time , it was commanded by the Bali de Tillet , and was garrisoned by the Cacciatori , who were a volunteer chasseur light infantry regiment . The fort repelled three French attacks , before surrendering after Grand Master Hompesch officially capitulated to Napoleon . 
 In the subsequent Maltese uprising and blockade , the fort remained in French hands . It continually fired at the insurgents ' San Rocco Battery , which was located about 700 metres ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) away . 
 = = British rule = = 
 The fort continued to be an active military installation throughout the British period . It was the scene of a mutiny in 1807 when Albanian soldiers of the Froberg Regiment revolted and shut themselves up in Fort Ricasoli . Despite attempts at negotiation they eventually blew up the main gunpowder magazine , causing extensive damage to the fort in the process . The mutiny was quashed by loyal troops , and some of the mutineers were condemned to death by court martial . The damaged parts of the fort were repaired , but were not rebuilt to their original design . A new magazine was built in 1829 to replace the one destroyed in the mutiny . 
 The fort was also used as a temporary naval hospital in the late 1820s and early 1830s , before <unk> Hospital was opened . During the cholera epidemic of 1837 , patients who had contracted the disease at the <unk> in Floriana were transferred to Ricasoli . Most of them died within a few days , and they were buried within the nearby Wied <unk> cemetery . Another cholera epidemic broke out at Ricasoli in 1865 . 
 In 1844 , the fort was manned by 500 men . In 1848 , Sir John Fox Burgoyne inspected Malta 's fortifications , and considered Ricasoli as " impregnable . " In the 1850s , artillery of a higher calibre was introduced to the fort , and the guns were replaced a number of times over the following decades . The seaward enceinte had been completely overhauled by 1878 , and by the 1900s , new gun emplacements , searchlights and a torpedo station had been installed . In the 1930s , concrete fire control towers were built on No. 2 , No. 3 and No. 4 Bastions , and further searchlights were installed . 
 Fort Ricasoli was active in the defence of Malta during World War II , and on 26 July 1941 its guns helped repel an Italian attack on the Grand Harbour . In April 1942 , the gate and Governor 's House were destroyed by German aerial bombardment . After the war , the fort was commissioned as HMS Ricasoli between 1947 and 1958 , and was used as a naval barracks . In 1958 , the gate was rebuilt , although the design was slightly different from the original . The Governor 's House was never reconstructed , mainly for financial reasons . In 1964 , the Admiralty transferred control of the fort to the Government of Malta .

 = = = Industrial use = = = 
 After the fort was handed over to the Maltese government , it was initially abandoned but it later became a container depot for raw material arriving in Malta . In 1976 , part of the ditch near the Left Ravelin was filled in , and St. Dominic Demi @-@ Bastion was breached to make way for a new road . 
 In 1964 , the fort 's ditch became a tank cleaning farm for the Malta <unk> . The depot , which is known as Ricasoli Tank Cleaning Facilities , treats liquid waste from ships arriving in the Grand Harbour and removes oil and other chemicals prior to releasing the waste into the sea . The facility was privatized in 2012 , and it is currently under the management of Waste Oils Co . Ltd . 
 The area around the fort eventually became an industrial park , which was known as Ricasoli Industrial Estate after the fort . The industrial estate was demolished in 2007 to make way for SmartCity Malta . 
 = = = Filming location = = = 
 Most of the fort is leased to the Malta Film Commission , and it has been used extensively as a location for various films and serials . In recent years , huge sets were built within its walls for the films Gladiator ( 2000 ) , Troy ( 2004 ) and Agora ( 2009 ) . In these films , the fort stood in as Rome , Troy and Alexandria respectively . The fort was also used in the filming of Assassin 's Creed ( 2016 ) . 
 The TV miniseries Julius Caesar ( 2002 ) and Helen of Troy ( 2003 ) were also partially filmed at Fort Ricasoli . A set dubbed as the Roman Road was built for Julius Caesar and this has been retained and used for other films . 
 The first season of HBO 's adaptation of George R. R. Martin 's Game of Thrones used various parts of the fort to represent the Red Keep .

 Today , Fort Ricasoli remains largely intact , although it is in a dilapidated state . The headland that it is built upon is prone to coastal erosion , and some of the walls between No. 3 and No. 4 Bastions have already collapsed into the sea . In 2004 , the Restoration Unit of the Ministry of Resources and Infrastructure removed , restored and re @-@ attached part of the fort 's walls , but nothing has been done to restore the entire fort . 
 In May 2015 , the Democratic Alternative and some NGOs suggested that the campus of the proposed American University of Malta should be split up between Fort Ricasoli and the nearby Fort Saint Rocco and Fort San Salvatore . This proposal will not be implemented , as the campus is to be split up between Dock No. 1 in <unk> and <unk> Point in Marsaskala . 
 As of 2015 , there is no public access to Fort Ricasoli .

 Fort Ricasoli has an irregular plan following the coastline of the peninsula it is built upon . The fort consists of a bastioned land front and its outworks , an enceinte facing the sea , and a tenaille trace facing Rinella Bay of the Grand Harbour . 
 = = = Land front = = = 
 The land front consists of the following bastions and demi @-@ bastions , which are linked together by curtain walls : 
 St. Dominic 's Demi @-@ Bastion , also known as Left Demi @-@ Bastion or No. 5 Bastion – the demi @-@ bastion at the northern end of the land front . It was damaged during the Froberg mutiny of 1807 , when its magazine was blown up . 
 St. Francis Bastion , also known as Central Bastion or No. 6 Bastion – a pentagonal bastion at the centre of the land front . It contains a traverse and a covered <unk> . 
 St. John 's Demi @-@ Bastion , also known as Right Demi @-@ Bastion or No. 7 Bastion – the demi @-@ bastion at the southern end of the land front . 
 The land front contains casemates , which were used as barracks . 
 The land front is further protected by the following outworks : 
 a faussebraye in the form of a crownwork encircling the entire land front . 
 St. Dominic Counterguard – a casemated counterguard near the left extremity of the land front . It was heavily damaged by the action of seawater , with half of the structure having collapsed . 
 two triangular ravelins between the St. Francis Bastion and either of the demi @-@ bastions . The Left Ravelin contains a 6 @-@ inch ( <unk> ) breech @-@ loading ( BL ) gun emplacement . 
 two caponiers leading from the land front to each of the ravelins . Extensive modifications were made to their structures by the British . 
 The outworks are surrounded by a ditch , a covertway and a glacis . 
 = = = Sea front enceinte = = = 
 The enceinte facing the open sea is made up of the following bastions and curtain walls : 
 No. 1 Bastion – a demi @-@ bastion linked to a tenaille , forming Point Battery . It originally contained an echaugette but this was dismantled to make way for a Directing Station for the Brennan Torpedo System . A gun emplacement for a RML 12 @.@ 5 inch 38 ton gun is located on the bastion 's face . 
 No. 1 Curtain – curtain wall between No. 1 and No. 2 Bastions , containing a casemated battery and a searchlight emplacement . 
 No. 2 Bastion – an asymmetrical bastion containing embrasures , and various British gun emplacements , magazines and a Fire Control Tower . 
 No. 2 Curtain – curtain wall between No. 2 and No. 3 Bastions , containing embrasures , an expense magazine ( where ammunition intended for immediate use was stored ) and a searchlight emplacement . 
 No. 3 Bastion – a flat @-@ faced bastion , containing embrasures and various British gun emplacements , magazines and a Fire Control Tower . 
 a curtain wall near No. 4 Bastion , containing embrasures , magazines and a sally port . Part of the curtain wall has collapsed into the sea . 
 No. 4 Bastion – a small bastion , containing a gun emplacement , magazine , gun crew shelters and a Fire Control Tower . 
 No. 5 Curtain – curtain wall between No. 4 Bastion and St. Dominic Demi @-@ Bastion of the land front , containing gun emplacements , magazines and gun crew shelters . 
 A shallow rock @-@ hewn ditch extends from No. 1 to No. 3 Bastions .

 The enceinte along Rinella Bay is made up of a tenaille trace with high walls . The fort 's main gate is located within the enceinte . The Governor 's House ( now demolished ) and Chapel of St. Nicholas are located within the fort , close to the main gate . The fort also contained a windmill , which does not exist anymore . 
 The rock @-@ hewn ditch of Orsi Battery can still be seen at the northern end of the tenaille , at the tip of the peninsula . 
 The British built a Brennan Torpedo Station near the trace in the late 19th century .

 Donald Patrick " Don " Dufek , Jr . ( born April 28 , 1954 ) is a former American football player who played safety and special teams for eight seasons with the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League ( NFL ) . He had previously played for the Michigan Wolverines football team in Ann Arbor from 1973 – 1975 . He was chosen to serve as team captain for both the Seahawks and Wolverines . 
 At Michigan , he was following in the footsteps of his father Don Dufek , Sr. who had been a Wolverine team Most Valuable Player . As a graduate of Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor , Dufek was able to stay close to home while performing as a two @-@ sport star at the University of Michigan where he played for the Michigan Wolverines football and hockey teams . In football , he was a member of back @-@ to @-@ back Big Ten Conference championship teams at Michigan and became an All @-@ American as well as a team captain . 
 Dufek , was sought after as a professional athlete in two sports : Dufek was drafted by teams in the National Hockey League , World Hockey Association and National Football League . He opted for football and played his entire professional career with the Seahawks . He endured several unsuccessful seasons in Seattle , but the team made the playoffs in his final two years . In his role as a special teams player , he again became a team captain . 
 = = Youth = = 
 Dufek grew up in Ann Arbor , the son of former fullback , Don Dufek , Sr. , who was named Most Valuable Player of the 1950 Michigan Wolverines football team and the MVP of the 1951 Rose Bowl . In 1971 , Dufek played linebacker for Ann Arbor Pioneer High School and was one of only three unanimous picks for the major All @-@ State football teams in the State of Michigan , as selected by the United Press International ( UPI ) , Associated Press ( AP ) , and Detroit Free Press . The coach of Pioneer 's cross @-@ town rival Huron High School said of Dufek in 1971 : " He 's the best I 've seen . " 
 In a 2003 interview with the Grand Rapids Press , Dufek recalled growing up in Ann Arbor and meeting his father 's Michigan teammates . " Living in Ann Arbor , and seeing all the things that embody a great university , you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics , and it just made you want to feel a part of it . Then , as you got older , and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself , you just hoped that you had a chance to play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium , that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you . "

 Michigan provided Dufek with the opportunity that he had hoped for . He played defensive back for the Wolverines from 1973 to 1975 and was named a team co @-@ captain and an All @-@ American as a member of the 1975 Wolverines team . He was chosen as a first @-@ team All @-@ American by the Football Writers Association of America , and the Walter Camp Football Foundation , and as a second @-@ team All @-@ American by UPI . Twice named an All @-@ Big Ten safety , Dufek had 249 tackles , nine fumble recoveries and four interceptions for the Wolverines . Although the 1973 and 1974 Michigan teams were Big Ten co @-@ champions , the Ohio State Buckeyes advanced to the Rose Bowl both years , and Dufek 's only bowl game appearance was in a 14 – 6 loss to the Oklahoma in the 1976 Orange Bowl . 
 = = = Hockey = = = 
 In addition to receiving three varsity letters in football , Dufek also received four letters as a left wing for the Michigan Wolverines hockey team . Dufek played with the hockey team only after the football season ended , and he managed to score about 10 goals a year in the shortened seasons he played . Dufek made a sufficiently solid showing in his freshman and sophomore years at Michigan that the Detroit Red Wings selected him in the sixth round of the 1974 NHL Amateur Draft . He was also drafted by the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the World Hockey Association with the 162nd overall selection in the eleventh round of the 1974 WHA Amateur Draft . 
 In a 1975 interview , Dufek noted his love of both sports : " There are times when I 've thought of dropping one or the other , but heck , I 've been doing this since high school and it would be pretty tough to quit them both now . " Dufek added : " Hockey is a more relaxed thing . It 's a smaller atmosphere and you have to deal with only one or two coaches . You can be more individual and flashy . Football has certain assignments and you can 't really express yourself . " In the end , however , Dufek chose the NFL over the NHL . He explained : " I 've decided to pursue professional football because I would probably have an extensive tour in the hockey minor leagues and I don 't want that . " 
 = = Seattle Seahawks = = 
 Dufek was drafted by the Seahawks with the second selection of fifth round and 126th overall selection of the 1976 NFL Draft . Dufek was one of the original Seahawks in 1976 , the franchise 's first year in the NFL , and he played for them until 1984 . He was the captain of the Seahawks ' special teams units in 1981 and 1982 . During both of these seasons he was co @-@ captain along with eventual Pro Football Hall of Famer and four @-@ term representative in United States House of Representatives , Steve Largent , the captain of the offensive unit and Keith Simpson , captain of the defensive unit . Over the course of his career he had three interceptions , two quarterback sacks , a fumble recovery and thirteen kickoff returns . Sportswriter Richard <unk> once wrote : " Don Dufek was the kind of guy who just won 't take ' No ' for an answer . He was released in training camp four times during his eight @-@ year Seahawks career . But each time , Seattle had a change of heart , bringing him back . Today , he is remembered as one of the best special teams performers the team has had . " 
 After numerous seasons under Jack Patera from 1976 @-@ 1982 and interim coach Mike McCormack in 1982 , the Seahawks finally reached the playoffs in Dufek 's final two seasons under Chuck Knox . During the 1983 NFL season , the Seahawks went 9 @-@ 7 and reached the AFC Championship Game where they lost to the Oakland Raiders . Then , during the 1984 NFL season , the Seahawks went 12 @-@ 4 and failed to reach the Conference Championships during the 1984 @-@ 85 Playoffs . 
 Dufek was interviewed by the Ann Arbor News in 2006 about life in Seattle . He said : " It 's a bigger version of Ann Arbor . It 's overcast , and it 's green and clean . " And there 's the coffee . " It 's really comical , " says Dufek of all the coffee stops in Seattle . " Even the gas stations have coffee bars . "

 Dufek now lives in Ann Arbor with his wife Candy Dufek . Dufek ran his own construction company , Dufek Wolverine Construction .

Jeff Gordon took over the lead on lap 163 , before Earnhardt became the leader on the 181st lap and maintained this position until Edwards regained it 14 laps later . The race was stopped for 17 minutes when Gordon crashed on lap 262 , and car parts were strewn into the path of other drivers , requiring officials to clean the track . Edwards maintained the lead at the restart and held it to win the race . There were eleven cautions and 19 lead changes by nine different drivers during the race . 
 The race was Edwards ' second consecutive win of the season , and the ninth of his career . Edwards was later issued with a 100 @-@ point penalty after his car was found to violate NASCAR regulations , dropping him from first to seventh in the Drivers ' Championship . Kyle Busch increased his lead over Ryan Newman to 20 points as a consequence . Ford took over the lead of the Manufacturers ' Championship , five points ahead of Dodge .

 The UAW @-@ Dodge 400 was the third scheduled stock car race of the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series , out of 36 . It was held on March 2 , 2008 , in Las Vegas , Nevada , at Las Vegas Motor Speedway , one of ten intermediate tracks to hold NASCAR races ; the others are Atlanta Motor Speedway , Charlotte Motor Speedway , Chicagoland Speedway , Darlington Raceway , Homestead @-@ Miami Speedway , Kansas Speedway , Kentucky Speedway , New Hampshire Motor Speedway , and Texas Motor Speedway . The standard track at Las Vegas Motor Speedway is a four @-@ turn 1 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) oval . Its turns are banked at twenty degrees and both the front stretch ( the location of the finish line ) and the back stretch are banked at nine degrees . 
 Before the race , Kyle Busch led the Drivers ' Championship with 335 points , ahead of Ryan Newman in second and Tony Stewart third . Kurt Busch and Carl Edwards were fourth and fifth , and Kasey Kahne , Kevin Harvick , Jimmie Johnson , Greg Biffle , Jeff Burton , Brian Vickers and Martin Truex Jr. rounded out the top twelve . In the Manufacturers ' Championship , Dodge and Ford were tied for the lead with twelve points each ; their rivals Chevrolet and Toyota were tied for third place with ten points each . Johnson was the race 's defending champion . 
 In preparation for the race , NASCAR held the second of its two pre @-@ season tests for Sprint Cup entrants on January 28 – 29 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway . Sessions began at 9 : 00 a.m. EST , paused from 12 : 00 to 1 : 00 p.m. , and concluded at 5 : 00 p.m. Sixty @-@ seven cars participated in the January 28 morning session ; Denny Hamlin was quickest with a top speed of 178 @.@ 265 miles per hour ( 286 @.@ 890 km / h ) , while Kyle Busch was quickest in the afternoon session , with a top speed of 183 @.@ 350 miles per hour ( 295 @.@ 073 km / h ) . Several incidents occurred during the second session ; Regan Smith spun leaving turn @-@ two and damaged his car 's nose after hitting the inside wall ; Sam Hornish Jr. heavily damaged his car after scraping the wall hard ; and Dario Franchitti heavily damaged his Dodge 's rear @-@ end after spinning . Jacques Villeneuve spun but did not damage his car ; David Ragan wrecked after spinning off turn @-@ two ; and Mark Martin damaged the front @-@ end of his vehicle when he hit a cement piling after swerving to avoid a tow truck . During the third session with seventy @-@ four cars , Edwards had the fastest speed of 184 @.@ 256 miles per hour ( 296 @.@ 531 km / h ) , and Burton damaged the right @-@ hand side of his car after hitting the wall . Juan Pablo Montoya recorded the fastest speed of the two days , at 186 @.@ 761 miles per hour ( 300 @.@ 563 km / h ) in the fourth and final session . 
 Edwards was looking forward to the race weekend and felt that his result would be good . Biffle was confident he could secure a top @-@ five finishing position , and stated if his car 's handling was good , he believed he could be in contention for winning the race . Having won twice at the track in the early 2000s , Kenseth stated that he enjoyed racing at Las Vegas Motor Speedway and hoped the Roush Fenway Racing cars would be able to contend for race victories . Johnson was considered by some bookmakers to be the favorite to win the race , and in the event he succeeded , he would have become the first person to secure four consecutive victories in a NASCAR Cup Series racing event since Gordon won the Southern 500 four times between 1995 and 1998 . He said that it would be " great " if he took the victory but would not approach the event differently than at a track where he had not won a race . 
 There was one change of driver before the race . Jon Wood , the grandson of retired driver Glen Wood , was originally scheduled to replace 1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion Bill Elliott in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing car , but withdrew because of a lack of experience with the Car of Tomorrow , and former Haas CNC Racing driver Johnny Sauter took over his seat . Wood said he felt Sauter was a better qualifier and Elliott was not available to drive . Kahne developed a sinus infection two days before the event , and his team had Nationwide Series driver Jason Keller ready to replace him if he could not compete .

 Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race , one on Friday and two on Saturday . The first session lasted 90 minutes , the second 45 minutes and the third 60 minutes . In the first practice session , Kyle Busch was fastest with a time of 30 @.@ 009 seconds ; Jeff Gordon was second and Johnson third . Stewart took fourth , and David Reutimann was placed fifth . Dale Earnhardt Jr . , Edwards , Elliott Sadler , Kurt Busch , and Jeremy Mayfield rounded out the session 's top ten fastest drivers . Hornish made contact with the turn @-@ two barrier , while Reed Sorenson and Patrick Carpentier spun in turn @-@ four but avoided damaging their cars . Montoya switched to a back @-@ up car after heavily colliding with the turn @-@ two wall , and Bobby Labonte did the same after he lost control in turn @-@ four and damaged his left @-@ rear quarter . Kahne made light contact with the turn @-@ four wall , repaired by his team . 
 Although 47 drivers were entered in the qualifier , according to NASCAR 's qualifying procedure only 43 could race . Each driver ran two laps , with the starting order determined by the competitor 's fastest times . Drivers who recorded their lap times early in the session were at an advantage because the track was cooler and thus gave more grip . Edwards felt his car had oversteer during his run . Kyle Busch won the third pole position of his career with a time of 29 @.@ 613 seconds . He was joined on the grid 's front row by Edwards , who was 0 @.@ 125 seconds slower and had the pole position until Kyle Busch 's lap . Martin qualified third , Gordon fourth , and Mike Skinner fifth . Biffle , Scott Riggs , Earnhardt , Kurt Busch , and Sadler completed the top ten qualifiers . The four drivers that failed to qualify were A. J. Allmendinger , Joe Nemechek , John Andretti , and Sauter ( who crashed at turn @-@ two on his first qualifying lap ) . Burney Lamar withdrew from the race prior to qualifying . After the qualifier Busch said his team was aware of the car 's potential which was displayed in Friday 's sole practice session and the January test session ; he was worried about his vehicle being very tight going into the first and second turns having been on the accelerator pedal throughout his fastest lap . 
 On Saturday afternoon , Matt Kenseth was fastest in the second practice session with a time of 30 @.@ 321 seconds , ahead of Clint Bowyer and Earnhardt . Travis Kvapil was fourth @-@ fastest ; David Gilliland was fifth and Biffle sixth . Johnson , Newman , Hornish and Edwards followed in the top ten . Kyle Busch scraped the outside wall while driving up the track ; he sustained minor damage and did not switch to a back @-@ up car . Later that day , Kahne paced the final practice session with a time of 30 @.@ 580 seconds ; Edwards was second and Paul Menard third . Gordon was fourth @-@ fastest , ahead of Hendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Earnhardt . Reutimann was seventh @-@ fastest , Biffle eighth , Bowyer ninth , and Dave Blaney tenth . Bowyer moved to the outside of the track but was unable to steer left and hit the outside wall leaving turn @-@ two and into the backstretch ; he came down the track and Kyle Petty hit Bowyer and damaged his front @-@ left fender before Bowyer 's car stopped after he made contact with the inside wall . Bowyer was required to use a back @-@ up car but Petty was able to repair his chassis .

 Live television coverage of the race began at 3 : 30 p.m. EST in the United States on Fox . Around the start of the race , weather conditions were sunny , between 54 and 64 ° F ( 12 and 18 ° C ) , and no rain was expected . Gusty winds from the north created strong headwinds on the back straight . Kenny Farmer , chaplain of Las Vegas Motor Speedway , began pre @-@ race ceremonies with an invocation . Actress Carol <unk> Johnson of the stage production Mamma Mia ! performed the national anthem , and John Byers , co @-@ director of UAW @-@ Chrysler National Training Center , commanded the drivers to start their engines . During the pace laps , two drivers moved to the rear of the field because of unapproved changes : Bowyer had switched to a back @-@ up car , and Kahne had changed his engine . 
 The race started at 4 : 48 p.m. ; Kyle Busch maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first corner and led the field on the first lap . Carpentier went up the track on the same lap but avoided hitting the barriers , while Reutimann did the same and scraped the outside wall , causing right @-@ rear damage to his car . He was black @-@ flagged by NASCAR because debris was dangling from his vehicle . Reutimann 's right @-@ rear tire exploded while entering the pit road on lap five but no debris was left on the track . On lap eight , Bowyer hit the wall , causing Kahne to drive down the track . He also made contact with Jamie McMurray , who slid through the infield frontstretch grass , causing the first caution flag and the appearance of the pace car . During the caution , most drivers elected to make pit stops for tires , and eighteen drivers remained on the track . 
 Kyle Busch stayed out and led the field back up to speed on the lap twelve restart . Four laps later , Edwards started to challenge Kyle Busch for the lead . Jeff Gordon moved up to third on lap 18 , and Martin moved from third to eighth by the same lap . Kyle Busch and Edwards ran alongside each other in the battle for the first position on lap 20 ; the battle concluded after Edwards passed Kyle Busch on the following lap . Gordon was passed by Biffle for third place on lap 22 , while Kurt Busch moved up to fifth on the same lap . By lap 28 , Biffle had closed the gap to Kyle Busch and passed him for second position two laps later . Edwards had a 1 @.@ 3 @-@ second lead over teammate Biffle on the same lap . Kyle Busch fell to fourth place after Gordon passed him on the 33rd lap . Kyle Busch reclaimed the third position from Gordon two laps later ; Kurt Busch had moved into third after moving ahead of Gordon on the same lap . By the 42nd lap , Edwards and teammate Biffle had opened a three @-@ second lead over Kyle Busch . Riggs and Kurt Busch both moved in front of Kyle Busch for third and fourth positions on lap 45 . 
 Green @-@ flag pit stops began on lap 48 . Edwards and Biffle made pit stops on lap 49 , handing the lead to Riggs . Hornish hit the turn @-@ two outside wall on the following lap after his right @-@ front tire went down in the tri @-@ oval , and sustained damage to his right @-@ front quarter panel , but no debris came off his car . After the pit stops , Edwards regained the lead and held a five @-@ second lead over Kyle Busch ; Martin moved into third place , Riggs regained fourth place , and Harvick moved up to fifth place by lap 65 . Three laps later , a second caution was needed when debris was spotted at turn @-@ two . Most of the leaders , including Edwards , made pit stops . Jeff Burton chose to remain on the track and led on the lap @-@ 75 restart , ahead of Earnhardt and Kyle Busch . On lap 78 , Kyle Busch moved ahead of Earnhardt to take second place and began to close the gap to Burton . Kyle Busch passed Burton to reclaim the lead three laps later , and opened up a 1 @.@ 3 @-@ second advantage over Burton by the 92nd lap . Earnhardt was passed by Edwards for fifth place on lap 94 and Biffle got ahead of Gordon for seventh on the same lap . Edwards gained fourth place when he passed Stewart on the 96th lap , and Burton lost second to Kenseth two laps later . On lap 102 , Burton fell to fourth place after Edwards passed him . 
 By lap 105 , Kyle Busch held a 3 @.@ 1 @-@ second lead over Kenseth . Three laps later , the third caution was triggered when Stewart 's car made heavy contact with the turn @-@ two wall after his right @-@ front tire burst . Stewart grazed his foot and climbed out of his car ; emergency workers helped take him to a waiting car that took him to the infield medical center for further examination . All of the race leaders , including Edwards , chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments under caution . NASCAR required Edwards to fall back to the end of the longest line because one of his crew members had allowed one of his tires to roll away from his pit box during his stop . Kyle Busch maintained the lead at the restart on lap 114 ; he was followed by Kenseth and Gordon . Kenseth passed Kyle Busch to take the lead on lap 117 . On the same lap , Gordon passed Busch . By lap 135 , Kenseth had opened up a 2 @.@ 2 @-@ second lead over Gordon . Biffle moved in front of Burton for fourth place on the 139th lap . On lap 144 , Robby Gordon 's right @-@ front tire blew , causing him to hit the turn @-@ two wall , and the fourth caution was triggered . All of the race leaders made pit stops during the caution . 
 Kenseth remained the leader at the lap @-@ 149 restart ; he was followed by Gordon . The fifth caution was deployed twelve laps later when Carpentier was squeezed towards the backstretch outside wall by Newman , causing Carpentier to slide down the track and hit the inside wall . During the caution , the leading drivers , including Kenseth , elected to make pit stops for tires . Gordon took the lead and maintained it at the lap @-@ 165 restart . Biffle and his teammate Kenseth drove alongside each other in a battle for second place on lap 166 , until Biffle escaped and ran onto the apron on the next lap . Mayfield burst his right @-@ front tire on lap 171 , but no debris came off his car , avoiding the need for a caution . Six laps later , Biffle passed Kyle Busch to take fifth place . Riggs experienced oversteer in the fourth turn while running down the inside of Labonte ; Franchitti ran into Riggs , causing the sixth caution on lap 179 . All of the leaders , including Kenseth , elected to make pit stops for tires . Earnhardt led the field on the lap @-@ 183 restart ; he was followed by Harvick and Edwards . Gordon moved into fifth place by lap 188 . Harvick fell to fourth place when Edwards and Kenseth passed him . 
 Edwards passed Earnhardt to reclaim the lead on lap 195 , while Earnhardt lost a further position after Kenseth got ahead of him on the same lap . Ten laps later , Biffle moved ahead of Harvick to take fifth place , while his teammate Kenseth had a 1 @.@ 5 @-@ second lead over the second @-@ place Edwards by the 211th lap . Three laps later , the seventh caution was issued when officials located debris in the turn @-@ two groove . The leaders , including Edwards , chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments . One tire from Edwards ' car went outside his pit box but he was not penalized because a cameraman blocked Edwards ' crew from retrieving the tire . Kenseth led the field back up to speed on the lap @-@ 219 restart ; Earnhardt was in second place and Edwards third . Casey Mears hit Vickers , who spun and triggered the eighth caution on lap 224 ; both drivers avoided contacting the wall . Kenseth maintained the lead on the lap @-@ 227 restart . Edwards drove up the track in an attempt to take the lead on lap 229 , but Kenseth kept the position . Four laps later , the ninth caution was needed when Dale Jarrett spun and hit the turn @-@ two outside wall . Kenseth remained the leader at the restart on lap 236 . Edwards passed teammate Kenseth for the lead two laps later , and began to pull away . Earnhardt caught up to Kenseth by lap 243 and ten laps later he passed Kenseth for second . 
 Kurt Busch 's right @-@ front tire exploded , causing him to hit the wall between turns three and four , and the tenth caution was shown on lap 256 . Kurt Busch retired from the race because of his crash . Edwards remained in the lead for the lap @-@ 262 restart . Earnhardt spun his tires , forcing Kenseth onto the outside lane and Gordon to the inside where he passed Earnhardt . Kenseth moved in front of Earnhardt and then made contact with Gordon , who was sent into the inside backstretch retaining wall , which had no SAFER barrier installed . Gordon 's car 's radiator flew out from its chassis and into the path of oncoming traffic . Kenseth slid but was able to straighten his car and continue . The final caution was initially waved before a red @-@ flag was shown , which stopped the race to allow officials to remove debris from the track . The race resumed 17 minutes later , with Edwards leading Earnhardt and Biffle . Edwards maintained the lead for the remaining two laps to secure his second consecutive win and the ninth of his career . Earnhardt finished second , ahead of Biffle in third place , Harvick in fourth , and Burton in fifth . Ragan , Kahne , Kvapil , Hamlin , and Martin rounded out the top ten finishers . The race had eleven cautions and nineteen lead changes among nine drivers . Edwards led four times for a total of 86 laps , more than any other competitor . 
 = = = Post @-@ race comments = = = 
 Edwards appeared in victory lane in front of the crowd of 153 @,@ 000 people to celebrate his second victory of the season , earning him $ 425 @,@ 675 . He was pleased with the result , saying it was " a very special win " and that he felt he was close to the form he had achieved in 2005 : " I tried hard to stay calm . And I 'm not the best at it sometimes . We all know that . " He added , " We do this to win . Winning these races is the greatest . Winning a championship would be the ultimate . What we ’ re trying to do is win the championship this year . That ’ s our number @-@ one goal . ” Second @-@ place finisher Earnhardt was disappointed , saying he had his car in his chosen position but the red @-@ flag period prevented him from winning the race : " Carl wasn 't going to get beat today . He had it in the bag . He was so strong ... I was terrible on cold tires . I wish all of you knew what that felt like . I hate it . " Biffle was philosophical as he argued that he had the fastest car but did not gain the track position he needed to challenge Edwards because he slid on pit road . 
 Despite his injury , Stewart said he hoped to participate in a planned two @-@ day test session at Phoenix International Raceway . He also said he was worried about his crash because his legs and hips were tingling and his lower back was in pain . Stewart said the crash scared him and the tingling in his legs had improved after leaving the infield care center . Gordon said his crash on lap 264 was " probably the hardest hit I 've ever taken " and admitted fault for causing the crash . According to Kenseth , " I knew he was going to get a run on me , so I laid back a little bit ... We came off [ turn ] 2 and I was up as high as I thought I could , and Jeff just came across . Whether it was on purpose or not , it just kind of wiped us out . " Gordon said he hoped Speedway Motorsports chairman and chief executive Bruton Smith ( the owner of Las Vegas Motor Speedway ) would install SAFER barriers along the inside retaining walls around the track . Biffle said there should have been no open gaps in the circuit barriers and that all NASCAR tracks should have SAFER barriers installed . After consultation with NASCAR officials , construction crews installed a 1 @,@ 700 @-@ foot ( 520 m ) long SAFER barrier along the inside backstretch wall in August 2008 . 
 After the race , NASCAR announced it had found a problem with the lid on the oil reservoir encasement during a post @-@ race inspection on Edwards ' car , which was later taken to the NASCAR Research and Development Center in Concord , North Carolina , for further analysis . Three days after the race , Roush Fenway Racing was given penalties for " actions detrimental to stock car racing " , " car , car parts , components and / or equipment used do not conform to NASCAR rules " , and a device or duct work that permitted air to pass through the car from one area of the interior of the car to another , or to the outside of the car . The penalties included a $ 100 @,@ 000 fine and a six @-@ race suspension for Edwards ' crew chief Bob Osborne , who was suspended from NASCAR until April 30 , 2008 , and placed on probation until December 31 , 2008 . Roush Fenway Racing chief engineer Chris Andrews took over Osborne 's role at the next race weekend . Edwards and car owner Jack Roush incurred the loss of 100 driver and owner points . In the event that Edwards qualified for the Chase for the Sprint Cup , he would not receive ten bonus points awarded to him for winning the race which was used to determine the seeding order . Edwards was allowed to keep the victory ; he moved from first to seventh in the Drivers ' Championship . On March 12 , Roush Fenway Racing announced it would not appeal the penalties . 
 Roush Fenway Racing president Geoff Smith said a bolt that held the oil lid together did not work because of vibration harmonics generated by Edwards ' car and the Las Vegas race track . Edwards said the infraction was " an absolute mistake " and that his team had no intention of cheating . Edwards ' teammate Biffle and Newman agreed the penalties were justified . According to Sadler , the penalties were not severe enough ; he argued that the driver should be penalized or required to miss one event . Toyota Racing Development General Manager Lee White said Roush Fenway Racing had modified Edwards ' car to enhance downforce by 240 lb ( 110 kg ) , which increased the car 's horsepower leaving the corners . Roush felt White 's comments were motivated by results . White later issued a statement in which he apologized for his comments . An internal investigation found no evidence that another person had intentionally caused the bolt to come loose , and that the team enacted protective measures to ensure the oil lid would stay fastened in future events . 
 The result meant Kyle Busch maintained his lead in the Drivers ' Championship , twenty points ahead of Newman in second place . Kahne 's seventh @-@ place finish allowed him to advance into third place , sixteen points in front of Harvick , who also moved up three positions . Biffle was in fifth place on 427 points . Burton , Edwards , Truex , Sadler , Earnhardt , Stewart and Kurt Busch rounded out the top twelve . Ford moved into the lead of the Manufacturers ' Championship , five points ahead of Dodge . Chevrolet moved three points clear of Toyota . The event had a television audience of 12 @.@ 1 million viewers ; it took three hours , eight minutes , and eight seconds to complete the race , and the margin of victory was 0 @.@ 504 seconds .

 = The Boat Race 1953 = 
 The 99th Boat Race took place on 28 March 1953 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . The race , in which the Oxford crew was slightly heavier than their opponents , was umpired by former rower Gerald Ellison . Cambridge won by eight lengths in a time of 19 minutes 54 seconds . It was their sixth win in seven years and took the overall record in the event to 54 – 44 in their favour . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and , as of 2014 , broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1952 race by a canvas , with Cambridge leading overall with 53 victories to Oxford 's 44 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Cambridge were coached by James Crowden ( who had represented Cambridge in the 1951 and 1952 races ) , David Jennens ( who rowed three times between 1949 and 1951 ) , Roy Meldrum ( a coach for Lady Margaret Boat Club ) and R. H. H. Symonds ( who had rowed in the 1931 race ) . Oxford 's coaches were A. J. M. Durand ( who had rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1920 race ) , Hugh " Jumbo " Edwards ( who rowed for Oxford in 1926 and 1930 ) , R. D. Hill ( who rowed in the 1940 wartime race ) and J. H. Page . The race was umpired for the second time by former Oxford rower and Bishop of Willesden Gerald Ellison . 
 In the build @-@ up to the race , opinions were divided on which crew was favourite to win . According to the rowing correspondent of The Manchester Guardian , upon arrival at Putney , Oxford demonstrated " great superiority " over Cambridge , yet the Light Blues had improved , and had " the pace , if not the form , to win " . The Times had declared " Oxford the stronger crew " on the day of the race . Queen Mary had died four days prior to the race ; the coxes wore black armbands and the flag post on the umpire 's launch was draped in black as marks of respect . The umpire was accompanied on his launch by the Chancellor of the University of Cambridge Lord Tedder . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 13 lb ( 81 @.@ 9 kg ) , 3 pounds ( 1 @.@ 4 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Cambridge saw two rowers return to their crew : J. S. M. Jones at number two and G. T. Marshall at number four . Oxford 's crew contained three rowers with Boat Race experience : A. J. Smith , M. L. Thomas and H. M. C. Quick . Two of the participants in the race were registered as non @-@ British : Oxford 's Smith was Australian while Cambridge 's L. B. <unk> was from the United States . The rowing correspondent for The Times described Oxford 's crew as containing " no outstanding individuals " yet " no weak links " . Conversely , Cambridge 's crew was " variable " in quality but in former Harvard University rower Louis <unk> , they had the " outstanding oarsman in either crew " . 
 = = Race = = 
 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . On a poor tide and in a strong south @-@ westerly wind , umpire Ellison started the race at 12 noon . Both crews rated 36 for the first minute , after which the Light Blues held a quarter @-@ length lead . Passing Beverley Brook , the bend in the river began to favour Oxford but Cambridge continued to pull away and were clear by a length as the crews passed the Mile Post . They increased the lead by a further half @-@ length as they passed the Crab Tree pub , and although Oxford made several bursts , they passed below Hammersmith Bridge six seconds behind the Light Blues , and fell in behind them , the " first visible gesture of despair " according to The Manchester Guardian 's rowing correspondent . 
 Pushing away from the bridge , Oxford stayed in touch with Cambridge for a brief period , although could not reduce their lead . Rowing into rough water towards Chiswick Eyot , Cambridge moved across to seek shelter closer to the Surrey shore , while Oxford continued in the difficult conditions . A lead of 14 seconds by Chiswick Steps was calmly extended to 20 seconds by the time the crews passed below Barnes Bridge . Cambridge won by eight lengths in a time of 19 minutes 54 seconds , a time which " could have been shortened by at least half a minute had the winners been pressed " . It was their sixth victory in the past seven and the fastest winning time since the 1949 race . The rowing correspondent for The Times described the result as a " spectacular reversal of form " having failed to show the pace they demonstrated in practice . 
 = Dresden Triptych = 
 The Dresden Triptych ( or Virgin and Child with St. Michael and St. Catherine and a Donor , or Triptych of the Virgin and Child ) is a very small hinged @-@ triptych altarpiece by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck . It consists of five individual panel paintings : a central inner panel , and two double @-@ sided wings . It is signed and dated 1437 , and in the permanent collection of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister , Dresden , with the panels still in their original frames . The only extant triptych attributed to van Eyck , and the only non @-@ portrait signed with his personal motto , ALC IXH XAN ( " I Do as I Can " ) . the triptych can be placed at the midpoint of his known works . It echoes a number of the motifs of his earlier works while marking an advancement in his ability in handling depth of space , and establishes iconographic elements of Marian portraiture that were to become widespread by the latter half of the 15th century . Elisabeth Dhanens describes it as " the most charming , delicate and appealing work by Jan van Eyck that has survived " . 
 The paintings on the two outer wings become visible when the triptych is closed . They show the Virgin Mary and Archangel Gabriel in an Annunciation scene painted in grisaille , which because of their near @-@ monochrome colouring give the impression that the figures are sculpted . The three inner panels are set in an ecclesiastical interior . In the central inner panel Mary is seated and holds the Christ Child on her lap . On the left hand wing Archangel Michael presents a kneeling donor , while on the right St. Catherine of Alexandria stands reading a prayer book . The interior panels are outlined with two layers of painted bronze frames , inscribed with mostly Latin lettering . The texts are drawn from a variety of sources , in the central frames from biblical descriptions of the assumption , while the inner wings are lined with fragments of prayers dedicated to saints Michael and Catherine . 
 The work may have been intended for private devotion , perhaps as a portable altarpiece for a migrant cleric . That the frames are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates that the donor , whose identity is lost , was highly educated and cultured . Because of a lack of surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15th century @-@ Northern painting , the identities of donors are often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians . In this work , damaged coats of arms on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the Giustiniani of Genoa – an influential <unk> active from 1362 – who established trade links with Bruges as early as the mid @-@ 14th century . 
 = = Provenance and attribution = = 
 The Dresden Triptych was probably in the possession of the Giustiniani family in the mid- to late @-@ 15th century . It is mentioned in a May 10 , 1597 record of a purchase by Vincenzo Gonzaga , Duke of Mantua , and was then sold with the Gonzaga Collection to Charles I of England in 1627 . After Charles 's fall and execution , the painting went to Paris and was owned by Eberhard <unk> , the Cologne @-@ based banker and art dealer for Louis XIV and Cardinal Mazarin . A year after <unk> 's death in 1695 , it passed to the Elector of Saxony , and next appears in a 1754 inventory of the Dresden Collection , attributed to Albrecht Dürer , until the German historian Aloys Hirt in 1830 established it as a van Eyck . In the mid @-@ 19th century the Dresden catalogues first attribute it to Hubert van Eyck ( d . 1426 ) and a few years later to Jan. 
 Van Eyck signed , dated and added his motto to the central panel , a fact only discovered when the frame was removed in the course of a mid @-@ 20th century restoration , and confirmed with the 1959 discovery of the signature which is placed along with the words <unk> DE <unk> ME FECIT ET C [ OM ] <unk> ANNO D [ <unk> <unk> IXH XAN ( " Jan Van Eyck Made And Completed Me In The Year 1437 . As I Can " ) . The word " completed " ( <unk> ) may suggest the completion date , but as master painters of the era typically had workshops to assist on major works , the wording can be seen as aggressively socially ambitious ; perhaps an arrogant master painter indicating his workshop assistants had little material involvement in the panels , and that he was primarily responsible for its design and execution . This view is reinforced by the fact that it is the only non @-@ portrait to contain van Eyck 's motto , ALC IXH XAN . Until the discovery of the signature the piece was variously dated to an early piece from the 1420s to his later period in the late 1430s . Because the panels are so definitely attributed they are often used as a touchstone to date van Eyck 's other works ; there are a number of evident stylistic developments , including the type of stained glass windows and mouldings around the arcades , and his ability at handling perspective , which can be used to determine if other works at least pre @-@ date the triptych . 
 The central panel has often been compared to his unsigned and undated Lucca Madonna of c . 1436 . That work echoes the central panel of the Dresden triptych in a number of aspects , including the dark green canopy , the figuration and positioning of Mary , her heavily @-@ folded dress , the orange and brown pigments of the floor , the geometric carpet and the wooden carvings . The Lucca Madonna is thought to be a portrait of the artist 's much younger wife , Margaret . 
 = = Description = = 
 The work measures 33 by 27 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 13 @.@ 0 in × 10 @.@ 8 in ) including the frames . Given this miniaturist scale , the triptych probably functioned as a portable devotional piece , or <unk> <unk> . Members of the upper @-@ classes and nobility acquired these through papal dispensation , to use during travel and typically during pilgrimage . Van Eyck 's patron and employer Philip the Good owned at least one portable triptych of which fragments survive . 
 The three inner panels comprise a typical sacra <unk> , a form established in Italy in the latter half of the 14th century with a patron saint presenting the donor , usually kneeling , to an enthroned " Deity or Mother of God " . John Ward believes the rich and complex iconography and symbolic meaning van Eyck employed in his religious panels served to highlight the co @-@ existence the artist saw between the spiritual and material worlds . In his earlier paintings , subtle iconographical features – referred to as disguised symbolism – are typically woven into the work , as " relatively small , in the background , or in the shadow [ details ] " . These elements include the apparition of the Virgin before the donor , whose panel contains carvings that seem to be reflective of events of his life . In his religious panels after 1436 , van Eyck 's reliance on iconographical or symbolic elements is greatly reduced . Ward speculates the reduced size of the work or the wishes of the commissioner influenced this choice , or he " decided that he had exhausted the most interesting possibilities and .... much of his carefully planned symbolism went unappreciated by patrons or by viewers . " According to Jacobs , the work reflects a system of symbolism in so far as heavenly and earthly objects are juxtaposed . This is most evident in the disparity between the monochromatic exterior and vivid inner panels . 
 = = = Frames = = = 
 The triptych retains its original frames , which are both ornate and served to protect the piece from the effects of light and smoke during travel and when in situ . The inner frames have recessed mouldings and are carved with gilded inscriptions , and the top corners of the two wing panels each bear a carved set of coat of arms . The lettering and phrases in Latin serve a dual purpose . They are decorative , similar to margins in medieval manuscripts , and set the context for the imagery ; van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison . Writing about Early Netherlandish triptychs , Jacobs says the inscriptions serve to distinguish and separate between the worldly and spiritual spheres , with the panels showing earthly images while the inscriptions on the frames act as reminder of heavenly influence . The letterings reinforce the duality between the earthly and heavenly , with St. Catherine 's a reminder of ascetic piety while the figure herself is depicted in sumptuous garments and jewels . 
 The inscriptions on the central panel are fragments from the Book of Wisdom ( 7 : 26 and 7 : 29 ) , and Ecclesiastes ( 24 : 23 – 24 ) . Those on the wing panels are taken from texts referring directly to the two saints . 
 = = = Inner panels = = = 
 = = = = Virgin and Child = = = = 
 In the central panel the Virgin and Child are enthroned in a church nave within a columned basilica running on either side . The columns are painted using a variety of dark red , orange and grey pigments , a colour scheme which Peter Heath describes as lending to a " sense of airy silence " . The throne is positioned on a dais , before a lavishly detailed oriental carpet lying on a similarly geometrically designed tiled floor . The arms of the canopied throne and the arches to either side contain carved or sculptured figures , including tiny representations of Isaac , and David and Goliath , although art historian Antje Maria Neuner reads this carving as showing Jephthah sacrificing his daughter . Mary wears a richly embroidered and as is typical for van Eyck , voluminous red robe , which effectively serves as a cloth of honour . The robe is placed over a blue square @-@ cut underdress edged with a jewelled border . In van Eyck 's Marian paintings , he almost always clothes her in red writes Pächt , which makes her seem to dominate the space . The Christ Child is naked and holds towards the donor a banderole adorned with a phrase from the Gospel of Matthew ( 11 : 29 ) , <unk> A ME , <unk> <unk> SUM ET <unk> <unk> ( " Learn of me , for I am meek and lowly in heart " ) . 
 Mary 's presence in the church is symbolic ; she and the child occupy the area where the altar would normally be situated . Like van Eyck 's two other late Madonna portraits ( Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele of 1436 and Madonna in the Church of c . 1438 – 40 ) , Mary is unrealistically large and out of proportion to her surroundings . This reflects the influence of 12th- and 13th @-@ century Italian artists such as Cimabue and Giotto , who in turn drew on the tradition of monumental depictions of Mary from Byzantine icons . According to Lorne Campbell , Mary is presented as if about to " rise from her throne and advance into the same plane as St. Michael and St. Catherine , she would tower above them and also above the columns of the church . " This idea is in keeping with van Eyck 's tendency in such portraits to present Mary as if she was an apparition materialising before the donor in response to his prayer and devotion . Van Eyck 's Mary is here monumental , but less overwhelmingly large than in 13th century works . She is disproportionate to the architecture in her panel , but approximately proportional to the figures in the wings . This restraint evidences the beginning of van Eyck 's mature phase , most evidently seen in the composition 's " greater spatial depth " . 
 Christ 's pose closely follows that of the Paele Madonna ; his body still leans towards the donor but here his head faces the viewer more directly . 
 = = = = Saints and donor wings = = = = 
 St. Catherine and the Archangel Michael occupy the right and left hand panels respectively . They appear to stand in either the aisles or <unk> , and a few bays to the fore compared to the central panel . Their depictions are in keeping with the artist 's evolving style : the aisles convey spaciousness , especially by the implied spaces out of view , while both saints subtly lean close to Mary . The use of perspective makes the saints appear small ; according to Pächt they are " less solid than the massive figures in the Paele Madonna . It was this Gothic <unk> that led many scholars ... to place this among Jan van Eyck 's early work " . The two side panels are filled with light streaming through the windows that reflects off the saints ' accoutrements , glinting from St. Michael 's armour and St. Catherine 's bejewelled steel sword . 
 On the right panel St. Catherine is presented as almost the essence of a gothic princess . She stands reading a book in " ravishing modesty " , with unbound blonde hair , which is topped with an elaborate jewelled crown very similar to that in the Madonna of Chancellor Rolin , combined with her rich blue gown and tabard of white draped ermine showing her as the princess she was . A golden chain with a jewelled pendant hangs from her neck . The attributes associated with her are included in her depiction . In her right hand , she holds the sword used for her beheading and at her feet lies the breaking wheel on which she was tortured . Like the woman in van Eyck 's Arnolfini Portrait she is " fashionably pear @-@ shaped " ; Heath describes her attire as " more dazzling than the Virgin 's " , mirroring St. Michael 's splendid armour on the opposite panel . 
 St. Catherine 's presence can be attributed to a number of factors . At that period her reputation and popularity were second to Mary 's ; she was both an educated and outspoken woman during her lifetime – characteristics that perhaps mirrored the donor 's . She is absorbed in her book in a contemplative manner , which might be reflective of a donor with a similar temperament . The frame of her wing is inscribed with the words <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> . <unk> EST <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> EST <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> EST <unk> ECT ( " The prudent virgin has longed for the starry throne where she has made her place ready ; leaving the world 's threshing floor , she saved the grain for herself by winnowing the chaff . The young girl has been steeped in heavenly learning . Stripped of everything , with sure footsteps she followed Christ until she was delivered from earthly affairs " ) . 
 A landscape can be seen through the window behind St. Catherine . Because of the miniature scale of the painting it can be seen only at close up . The view is built with extremely fine brushwork and shows a number of highly detailed buildings and hills before <unk> mountains . 
 A lance rests against the shoulder of a youthful @-@ looking St. Michael . Michael is dressed in elaborately jewelled and coloured armour , his left arm holding his helmet , while his right hand rests on the shoulder of the donor as he is presented to Mary . The donor kneels in prayer before the Virgin , with his hands held upwards as if in prayer , although they are not clasped . He wears a gold ring on his right small finger , and is dressed in a long olive @-@ green <unk> , at the time the height of fashion and an indicator of status within the Burgundian court . The gown has a fur @-@ lined high collar and deep baggy sleeves , also lined with fur . The donor 's bowl @-@ shaped haircut , rounded at the fringe but cut above his ears , is also typical of mid @-@ 1430s Netherlandish fashion . Except for the red hood , the garment closely resembles that worn by the groom in the Arnolfini Portrait . 
 The capital of the pillar above the donor 's head is lined with carvings of military scenes . Similar carvings are seen near the donor in van Eyck 's earlier van der Paele and Madonna of Chancellor Rolin , and where they depict events or personal circumstances from the donor 's life . Those in the present work likely serve a similar role , however because the donor is unidentified it is unknown as to what they may refer . Elisabeth Dhanens speculates that they might depict the sarcophagus of Hippolytus in Pisa , which she believes adds credibility to the belief the donor was of Italian origin ; she also notes the military scene reflects St. Michael 's status as military commander . Ward compares the carving to a similar one found in the Washington Annunciation . Unlike in van Eyck 's earlier votive portraits the donor is positioned at a remove from the Marian apparition , and at a much smaller scale to Mary on a triptych wing . 
 The lettering running along the edges of the panel 's frame consists of a prayer fragment from the liturgy for the feast of St. Michael . The extract reads HIC EST <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> HONOR <unk> <unk> <unk> ET <unk> <unk> AD <unk> <unk> . HIC <unk> <unk> DEI <unk> DE <unk> <unk> . <unk> DEI <unk> <unk> IN <unk> <unk> . A <unk> ( " This is Michael the Archangel , leader of the angelic hosts , whose privilege it is to grant favours to the people , and whose prayer leads them to the Kingdom of Heaven . The Archangel Michael is God 's messenger for the souls of the just . By the grace of God , that great victor has taken his place in Heaven , on the side of peace ' " ) . 
 = = = Outer panels = = = 
 When the triptych is closed , the outer wings reveal an Annunciation scene with the Archangel Gabriel and Mary painted in grisaille . The figures form an illusionistic imitation of sculpture , a conceit which van Eyck extends by placing them on octagonal pedestals . The figures are illuminated by light from the left , a device van Eyck often used to imply the presence of God . A dove , representing the Holy Spirit , hovers above Mary . Because the dove is also in grisaille but not attached to a pedestal and apparently floating unfixed above the saints , its presence serves to highlight that the viewer is not looking at sculpture but at a painted representation of sculpture . 
 The annunciation dominates any other theme on the outer wings of Northern 15th @-@ century polyptychs . The tradition originates from Byzantine art , with van Eyck largely responsible for re @-@ popularising the practice . Along with his Ghent Altarpiece , the Dresden Triptych is one of the earliest surviving examples of the technique , and on this basis he is usually credited as the innovator of a motif that became almost standard from the mid @-@ 15th century . As the annunciation marks the incarnation of Christ , its representation on the outer wings gives symmetry to the scenes of his life typically detailed on the inner panels . 
 The outer wings of 15th @-@ century diptychs and triptychs typically contained Annunciation scenes painted in grisaille . Molly Teasdale Smith believes the practice echoes the tradition of covering religious imagery with grey cloth during the then @-@ 46 day lenten period leading up to Easter . There is a symmetry with this in how polyptychs were typically kept closed except for Sundays or church holidays , when they were opened to reveal the more colourful and expansive inner panels . 
 According to Dhanens , the sculptural depictions on the outer panels are a " brilliant success ... in imparting a sense of life to the supposed statues . " The wings continue van Eyck 's innovation in placing two grisaille outer panels wings of polyptychs ; the earliest extant example being the Annunciation wings of the Ghent Altarpiece . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The depicted church is of a Romanesque style with Gothic elements . There are pointed canopies above Mary , and the nave is narrow , barely wide enough to contain her . It is walled by a colonnade joined by entablatures and capped with rounded arches . The columns are variously of pink , red and purple marble . Each of the capitals is decorated with faux carvings , some showing representations of the twelve apostles under a small baldachin . The vaulting is visible in the aisles but not in the central nave . There are a number of implied spaces not visible to the viewer . The central panel contains two on either side of the pillars , others lead from the balcony above the throne , and there are unseen exits to hallways at the rear of the two wing panels . The east facing windows in the right hand wing resemble those in van Eyck 's Rolin Madonna . 
 The centre panel 's spatial depth marks an advancement in van Eyck 's technique , especially when compared to his similar 1436 Diptych of the Annunciation or van der Paele panel , both of which are comparatively flat . The depth of space is accomplished through such devices as placing the Virgin at the far end of the pictorial space , making her appear both smaller and seemingly at a remove and accentuating the receding lines of the carpets by setting them against the parallels of the folds of her gown . The recessional perspective is further achieved by the sequence of columns stretching back from the throne . This is particularly noticeable with the positioning of the throne in comparison to the Lucca Madonna and van der Paele panels . 
 As with van Eyck 's earlier paintings of interiors , the building is not based on a particular place , but is an imagined and idealised formation of what he viewed as a perfect and representational architectural space . This is evidenced by a number of features that would be unlikely in an actual contemporary church such as the sculptures that were more secular in nature . In detailing the structure he pays close attention to contemporary models , which he possibly combined with elements from ancient buildings . The columns contain " high prismatic bases " found in early churches and on the Arch of Constantine . Craig Harbison believes that because the interior is not based on an actual building , the viewer is not burdened by preconceptions , a device which perhaps opens up the painting 's " physiological " impact . In his view , the panels capture the moment when the donor 's prayer and piety is rewarded by an apparition of the Virgin and Child . The novelty and unworldliness of the situation is highlighted by the unrealistic size of the Virgin compared to her surroundings . 
 Light plays a central role in all panels , to an extent almost comparable to van Eyck 's Madonna in the Church . The arches and columns are bathed in daylight , echoed by the text of the inscriptions around the central frame allude to light and illumination . Van Eyck pays close attention to the saturating effects and gradations of the light , which enters from the left and spreads across the middle ranges of each panel . He often used light to indicate a divine ethereal presence . Because the implied spaces found on either side of Mary and leading into each of the wing panels are bathed in this light , they can be seen as conduits for the divine . 
 The triptych influenced Rogier van der Weyden 's 1445 – 50 Seven Sacraments Altarpiece in a number of aspects , most obviously in its disregard of scale , especially with Mary 's size relative to the other figures and surrounding architecture . Van der Weyden develops the idea further , placing a large crucifixion towering above the figures and almost spanning the height of the central panel . 
 = = Donor = = 
 The identity of the donor has not been established , although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years . Harbison suggests the work 's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work , and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy . Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant . This belief has been fed by the triptych 's similarity to Giovanni <unk> 's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli , Tuscany , which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century . Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family , known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries . If not commissioned by that family , historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century . In the early 1800s , Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor , however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437 , and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430 . 
 Mid @-@ twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design , perhaps as early as the 15th century , whose <unk> and history is now lost . Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine , advancing that they were a member of the Italian <unk> family , whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine . Their daughter , also named Catherine , married the Italian merchant Michel <unk> ( <unk> in Flemish ) from Lucca , who was active in Bruges . From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple . Documents show weavers in <unk> paid taxes to Catherine <unk> and in September 1434 , when Michele <unk> was tax collector in that town , van Eyck received a stipend funded by local tax receipts , suggesting a connection . Dhanens admits the donor 's identity is lost , but she says of the piece that " it could have been a gift from the husband to the wife , a pledge of his affection during his absences ; or it could have been a gift from the wife to the husband , by way of protection on his travels . "

 The triptych is in poor condition , having suffered damage and heavy paint loss , and has undergone a number of restorations . The outer wooden frames , originally painted in grey and yellow marbling , were later overpainted in a design of black and red in the 16th or 17th centuries when " a faux turtle @-@ shell design , imitating the then @-@ fashionable veneer , replaced the earlier scheme of <unk> paint " . An ebony surround was added to the inner frames for protection in the 1840s . There has been extensive repair work on the paint forming Mary 's dress , with large areas of her gown repaired in 1844 by painter Eduard Bendemann . The badly damaged coats of arms have been retouched , while the frames have sustained impairment and are overpainted in areas . The painting was looted and taken to Moscow during the Second World War . It was returned in 1959 when it was cleaned , restored and underwent examination in a laboratory . This process revealed the ALC IXH XAN inscription on the inner moulding of the central frame in front of the tiled floor when a coat of brown paint was stripped away . The surround was removed during the 1959 restoration . 
 = Hurricane Richard = 
 Hurricane Richard was a damaging hurricane that affected areas of Central America in October 2010 . It developed on October 20 from an area of low pressure that had stalled in the Caribbean Sea . The system moved to the southeast before turning to the west . The storm slowly organized , and the system intensified into a tropical storm . Initially , Richard only intensified slowly in an area of week steering currents . However , by October 23 , wind shear diminished , and the storm intensified faster as it headed toward Belize . The next day , Richard intensified into hurricane status , and further into its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane , reaching maximum winds of 100 mph ( 150 km / h ) . The hurricane made its only landfall on Belize at peak intensity . Over land , Richard quickly weakened , and later degenerated into a remnant low on October 25 . 
 Hurricane Richard caused an estimated $ 80 million ( 2010 USD ) in damages in its path , much of which was in Belize . In Honduras , damage was mostly limited to power outages and landslides . In Belize , most of the damage was attributed to damage to crops . Power outages were also widespread across the country . Two fatalities occurred in Belize , one direct and the other indirect . One person drowned after his ship capsized during the storm and another was mauled to death by a jaguar that had escaped its cage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane Richard can be traced back to a tropical wave that moved off the African coast on October 4 and moved westward , stalling over Venezuela on October 13 . Over the next 3 days , it drifted into the extreme southwestern Caribbean Sea , and soon developed an area of low pressure , until it stalled just north of Panama . On October 16 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) began to monitor that area of disturbed weather in association with a weak trough of low pressure over the southwestern Caribbean Sea , which persisted across the region as Hurricane Paula dissipated over Cuba on the same day . By October 17 , the easterly and northerly trade winds flowed into the low , producing a disorganized area of convection , or thunderstorms across the region . For several days the system moved generally west @-@ northwestward toward Central America . Convection increased over the low on October 18 , and the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of further organization due to favorable environmental conditions . Later that day , it passed near the eastern coast of Nicaragua . The storm became more organized as it turned to a north @-@ northwest drift in the northwestern Caribbean Sea . 
 The Hurricane Hunters investigated the system on October 19 and indicated the development of a low @-@ level circulation . As such , the NHC noted that the storm was very close to tropical depression strength . The next day , after the system turned to the east , strong upper @-@ level wind shear impeded its further development , but such conditions were expected to abate . Early on October 21 , the convection had organized and increased near the center of circulation despite still being in an area of moderate wind shear . Due to the organization , the NHC classified it as Tropical Depression Nineteen about 125 miles ( 200 km ) south of Grand Cayman . At the time , the depression was drifting eastward , located near the base of a mid @-@ level trough and toward the west of a subtropical ridge . In the hours after its formation , the center remained located along the western portion of a cyclonically curved rainband as the convection increased . The wind shear decreased , and despite the presence of dry air to its northwest , the depression intensified to Tropical Storm Richard by 1500 UTC on October 21 , based on confirmation from the Hurricane Hunters . However post – operational analysis revealed that the depression became a tropical storm slightly earlier , at 1200 UTC . 
 Upon intensifying to tropical storm status , Richard was moving southeastward , still in an area of weak steering currents and in the midst of undergoing a loop in its track . Two hurricane models predicted for the storm to intensify to major hurricane status over the western Caribbean . The official forecast was for the storm to make landfall on Belize with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) . As Richard continued generally southward early on October 22 , its convection became ragged and linear , preventing any initial strengthening . Additionally , the circulation became elongated as the thunderstorms deteriorated , due to the continued presence of dry air and wind shear . After turning westward , Richard moved parallel just offshore the Honduras coast , and its circulation became difficult to locate on satellite imagery . 
 On October 23 , Tropical Storm Richard began strengthening again , after the shear diminished and the storm took advantage of the warm waters of the western Caribbean . Later that day , a mid @-@ level eye feature became evident on satellite imagery . Additionally , the outflow gradually improved and became more symmetrical throughout the circulation . On October 24 , Hurricane Hunters indicated that Richard attained hurricane status , based on surface winds of 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) . In addition , radar from Belize at the time indicated a nearly @-@ closed eyewall . The hurricane continued intensifying to peak winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) , and the minimum central pressure dropped to 977 millibars ( 28 @.@ 9 inHg ) , making it a Category 2 hurricane , despite the fact that it was operationally classified as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) and a pressure of 981 millibars ( 29 @.@ 0 inHg ) . 
 At around <unk> UTC on October 25 , Hurricane Richard made landfall about 20 miles ( 35 km / h ) south @-@ southeast of Belize City , Belize at peak intensity , and just after moving ashore , the eye briefly became better defined . Within a few hours however , the inner core lost definition as the eye dissipated . The winds rapidly diminished , and Richard weakened to tropical depression status after crossing into northern Guatemala . By then , there was little deep convection remaining , and after emerging into the Bay of Campeche Richard degenerated into a remnant low on October 26 , but then turned back east as the system was forced to because of the strong wind shear . After the storm reached the Yucatán Peninsula , the system began turning north until it reached the Gulf of Mexico . The remnants of Hurricane Richard continued to move north over the Gulf of Mexico as it weakened , until the system dissipated completely , late on October 27 .

 Starting late on October 21 , the Government of Honduras issued a tropical storm watch for then @-@ Tropical Storm Richard , which covered the north coast of Honduras from Limón to the border with Nicaragua . When Richard finally began to head westward on October 22 , the tropical storm watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warnings ; a hurricane watch was also issued for the same location . By 1500 UTC on October 23 , the Government of Honduras had issued a tropical storm warning from Limón heading westward toward Puerto Cortés ; the tropical storm warning also included the three Bay Islands of Guanaja , Roatán , and Útila . As Richard was predicted to brush the coast of Honduras just offshore , the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning . 
 At the time Richard had intensified into a hurricane , it had moved away from eastern Honduras , and the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was discontinued from Limón to the border with Nicaragua . While Hurricane Richard was approaching Belize on October 24 , the Government of Honduras discontinued all watches and warning that had been issued in association with the storm as was no longer considered a possible threat for landfall . 
 While passing to the north of the country , Richard knocked down trees and power lines on the northern Honduras coast . Some power outages occurring in areas resulted from the fallen power lines . In addition , mudslides triggered by rainfall cut off an estimated 15 @,@ 000 people in 40 small towns . Four coastal Honduran provinces were declared areas of maximum alert by the government after the storm . The offshore Bay Islands also experienced heavy rainfall due to Richard . Winds on the islands peaked at 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) on Roatán .

 The Government of Belize began warning of the threat of Richard on October 22 , starting with a tropical storm watch issued for the entire east coast of the country . As Tropical Storm Richard was rapidly intensifying , the tropical storm watch on the coast of Belize was replaced with a tropical storm warning , which had been upgraded at 1500 UTC October 23 . Only three hours after the replacement of the tropical storm watch to warning , Richard was nearing hurricane status , and the tropical storm warning in place on the east coast of Belize upgraded to a hurricane warning . The hurricane warning associated with Hurricane Richard remained in place for the east coast of Belize as landfall was occurring , since the storm made landfall to the south @-@ southeast of Belize City . Prior to the storm 's landfall , an estimated 10 @,@ 000 people took refuge in storm shelters and churches . 
 Throughout Belize , Hurricane Richard damaged thousands of homes and leaving many without power . The Belize Zoo and Tropical Education Center , a major attraction for ecotourists and <unk> , was in the path and heavily damaged forcing it to close to remove debris and repair their animal exhibits . Overall damage was BZ $ 33 @.@ 8 million ( $ 17 @.@ 4 million 2010 USD ) , most of which from crop damage , especially to citrus fruits . The entire grapefruit harvest was lost , an estimated 25 % of orange crops were lost , and several large trees were downed . In addition , about 200 homes were destroyed .

 The Government of Mexico also gave warnings of the approaching Richard , first issuing a hurricane watch also the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula from Punta Gruesa southward to the city of Chetumal , which is on the border with Belize . In addition to the hurricane watch issued for that portion for the Yucatán Peninsula , a tropical storm warning was set in effect for the same area . Although Hurricane Richard approached closely to the Mexican portion of the Yucatán Peninsula , there were no changes to the watches and warning from 1500 UTC October 23 to the time of landfall in Belize . After Hurricane Richard made landfall in Belize , the Government of Mexico discontinued the hurricane watch from Punta Gruesa southward to Chetumal , although the tropical storm warnings have been cancelled . 
 Governor of Quintana Roo Félix González Canto declared Chetumal as the highest state of alert prior to Richard . However , areas on the northeastern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula were put on only minimum alert by the government . 
 = Agrippina ( opera ) = 
 Agrippina ( HWV 6 ) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel with a libretto by Cardinal Vincenzo Grimani . Composed for the 1709 – 10 Venice Carnevale season , the opera tells the story of Agrippina , the mother of Nero , as she plots the downfall of the Roman Emperor Claudius and the installation of her son as emperor . Grimani 's libretto , considered one of the best that Handel set , is an " anti @-@ heroic satirical comedy " , full of topical political allusions . Some analysts believe that it reflects Grimani 's political and diplomatic rivalry with Pope Clement XI . 
 Handel composed Agrippina at the end of a three @-@ year sojourn in Italy . It premiered in Venice at the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo on 26 December 1709 . It proved an immediate success and an unprecedented series of 27 consecutive performances followed . Observers praised the quality of the music — much of which , in keeping with the contemporary custom , had been borrowed and adapted from other works , including the works of other composers . Despite the evident public enthusiasm for the work , Handel did not promote further stagings . There were occasional productions in the years following its premiere but Handel 's operas , including Agrippina , fell out of fashion in the mid @-@ 18th century . 
 In the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America . Performances of the work have become more ever common , with innovative stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007 . Modern critical opinion is that Agrippina is Handel 's first operatic masterpiece , full of freshness and musical invention which have made it one of the most popular operas of the ongoing Handel revival . 
 = = Background = = 
 Handel 's earliest opera compositions , in the German style , date from his Hamburg years , 1704 – 06 , under the influence of Johann Mattheson . In 1706 he traveled to Italy where he remained for three years , developing his compositional skills . He first settled in Florence where he was introduced to Alessandro and Domenico Scarlatti . His first opera composed in Italy , though still reflecting the influence of Hamburg and Mattheson , was Rodrigo ( 1707 , original title <unk> se <unk> ê la <unk> <unk> ) , was presented there . It was not particularly successful , but was part of Handel 's process of learning to compose opera in the Italian style and to set Italian words to music . 
 Handel then spent time in Rome , where the performance of opera was forbidden by Papal decree , and in Naples . He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios ; at that time there was little difference ( apart from increasing length ) between cantata , oratorio and opera , all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo . Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata <unk> , Galatea e <unk> , written in Naples . While in Rome , probably through Alessandro Scarlatti , Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani , a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time , and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts . He was evidently impressed by Handel and asked him to set his new libretto , Agrippina . Grimani intended to present this opera at his family @-@ owned theatre in Venice , the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo , as part of the 1709 – 10 Carnevale season . 
 = = Writing history = = 
 = = = Libretto = = = 
 Grimani 's libretto is based on much the same story used as the subject of Monteverdi 's 1642 opera L 'incoronazione di Poppea . Grimani 's libretto centres on Agrippina , a character who does not appear in Monteverdi 's darker version . Grimani avoids the " moralizing " tone of the later opera seria libretti written by such acknowledged masters as Metastasio and Zeno . According to the critic Donald Jay Grout , " irony , deception and intrigue pervade the humorous escapades of its well @-@ defined characters . " All the main characters , with the sole exception of Claudius 's servant <unk> , are historical , and the broad outline of the libretto draws heavily upon Tacitus 's Annals and Suetonius ' Life of Claudius . It has been suggested that the comical , <unk> character of the Emperor Claudius is a caricature of Pope Clement XI , to whom Grimani was politically opposed . Certain aspects of this conflict are also reflected in the plot : the rivalry between Nero and Otho mirror aspects of the debate over the War of the Spanish Succession , in which Grimani supported the Habsburgs and Pope Clement XI France and Spain . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 According to John Mainwaring , Handel 's first biographer , Agrippina was composed in the three weeks following Handel 's arrival in Venice in November 1709 , a theory supported by the autograph manuscript 's Venetian paper . In composing the opera Handel borrowed extensively from his earlier oratorios and cantatas , and from other composers including Reinhard Keiser , Arcangelo Corelli and Jean @-@ Baptiste Lully . This practice of adapting and borrowing was common at the time but is carried to greater lengths in Agrippina than in almost all of Handel 's other major dramatic works . The overture , which is a French @-@ style two @-@ part work with a " thrilling " allegro , and all but five of the vocal numbers , are based on earlier works , though subject in many cases to significant adaptation and reworking . 
 Examples of recycled material include Pallas 's " Col <unk> <unk> " , which is based on Lucifer 's aria from La <unk> ( 1708 ) , " O voi dell ' <unk> " , which was itself adapted from Reinhard Keiser 's 1705 opera Octavia . Agrippina 's aria " Non ho cor che per amarti " was taken , almost entirely unchanged , from " Se la morte non <unk> " in Handel 's earlier dramatic cantata Qual ti <unk> , oh Dio ( 1707 ) ; Narcissus 's " <unk> " is an adaptation of " Sai <unk> " from another 1707 cantata , <unk> , <unk> e <unk> ; and parts of Nero 's Act 3 aria " Come nube che fugge dal vento " are borrowed Handel 's oratorio Il trionfo del tempo ( all from 1707 ) . Later , some of Agrippina 's music was used by Handel in his London operas Rinaldo ( 1711 ) and the 1732 version of Acis and Galatea , in each case with little or no change . The first music by Handel presented in London may have been Agrippina 's " Non ho cor che " , transposed into Alessandro Scarlatti 's opera Pirro è <unk> which was performed in London on 6 December 1710 . The Agrippina overture and other arias from the opera appeared in <unk> performed in London between 1710 and 1714 , with additional music provided by other composers . Echoes of " Ti vo ' <unk> " ( one of the few arias composed specifically for Agrippina ) can be found in the air " He was despised " , from Handel 's Messiah ( 1742 ) . 
 Two of the main male roles , Nero and Narcissus , were written for castrati , the " superstars of their day " in Italian opera . The opera was revised significantly before and possibly during its run . One example is the Act III duet for Otho and Poppaea , " No , no , ch 'io non <unk> " , replaced with two solo arias before the first performance . Another is Poppaea 's aria " <unk> " , replaced during the run with another of extreme virtuosity , " Pur <unk> chi m 'ha <unk> " , either to emphasise Poppaea 's new @-@ found resolution at this juncture of the opera or , as is thought more likely , to flatter <unk> by giving her an additional opportunity to show off her vocal abilities . 
 The instrumentation for Handel 's score follows closely that of all his early operas : two recorders , two oboes , two trumpets , three violins , two cellos , viola , timpani , contrabassoon and harpsichord . By the standards of Handel 's later London operas this scoring is light , but there are nevertheless what Dean and Knapp describe as " moments of splendour when Handel applies the full concerto grosso treatment . " Agrippina , Handel 's second Italian opera , was probably his last composition in Italy .

 On hearing that her husband , the Emperor Claudius , has died in a storm at sea , Agrippina plots to secure the throne for Nero , her son by a previous marriage . Nero is unenthusiastic about this project , but consents to his mother 's wishes ( " Con <unk> tuo <unk> " ) . Agrippina obtains the support of her two freedmen , Pallas and Narcissus , who hail Nero as the new Emperor before the Senate . 
 With the Senate 's assent , Agrippina and Nero begin to ascend the throne , but the ceremony is interrupted by the entrance of Claudius 's servant <unk> . He announces that his master is alive ( " <unk> ! Claudio <unk> ! " ) , saved from death by Otho , the commander of the army . Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him the throne as a mark of gratitude . Agrippina is frustrated , until Otho secretly confides to her that he loves the beautiful Poppaea more than he desires the throne . Agrippina , aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea , sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero . She goes to Poppaea and tells her , falsely , that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he , Otho , gains the throne but gives Poppaea to Claudius . Agrippina advises Poppaea to turn the tables on Otho by telling the Emperor that Otho has ordered her to refuse Claudius 's attentions . This , Agrippina believes , will make Claudius revoke his promise to Otho of the throne . 
 Poppaea believes Agrippina . When Claudius arrives at Poppaea 's house she denounces what she believes is Otho 's treachery . Claudius departs in fury , while Agrippina cynically consoles Poppaea by declaring that their friendship will never be broken by deceit ( " Non ho cor che per amarti " ) .

 Pallas and Narcissus realize that Agrippina has tricked them into supporting Nero and decide to have no more to do with her . Otho arrives , nervous about his forthcoming coronation ( " <unk> il crin d <unk> " ) , followed by Agrippina , Nero and Poppaea , who have come to greet Claudius . All combine in a triumphal chorus ( " Di timpani e <unk> " ) as Claudius enters . Each in turns pays tribute to the Emperor , but Otho is coldly rebuffed as Claudius denounces him as a traitor . Otho is devastated and appeals to Agrippina , Poppaea , and Nero for support , but they all reject him , leaving him in bewilderment and despair ( " Otton , qual <unk> <unk> " followed by " Voi che <unk> il mio lamento " ) . 
 However , Poppaea is touched by her former beloved 's grief , and wonders if he might not be innocent ( " Bella pur nel mio <unk> " ) . She devises a plan and when Otho approaches her , she pretends to talk in her sleep recounting what Agrippina has told her earlier . Otho , as she intended , overhears her and fiercely protests his innocence . He convinces Poppaea that Agrippina has deceived her . Poppaea swears revenge ( " <unk> una sol volta " , alternate aria " Pur <unk> chi m 'ha <unk> " ) but is distracted when Nero comes forward and declares his love for her . Meanwhile Agrippina , having lost the support of Pallas and Narcissus , manages to convince Claudius that Otho is still plotting to take the throne . She advises Claudius that he should end Otho 's ambitions once and for all by abdicating in favour of Nero . Claudius agrees , believing that this will enable him to win Poppaea . 
 = = = Act 3 = = = 
 Poppaea now plans some deceit of her own , in an effort to divert Claudius 's wrath from Otho with whom she has now reconciled . She hides Otho in her bedroom with instructions to listen carefully . Soon Nero arrives to press his love on her ( " Coll <unk> del tuo bel core " ) , but she tricks him into hiding as well . Then Claudius enters ; Poppaea tells him that he had earlier misunderstood her : it was not Otho but Nero who had ordered her to reject Claudius . To prove her point she asks Claudius to pretend to leave , then she summons Nero who , thinking Claudius has gone , resumes his passionate wooing of Poppaea . Claudius suddenly reappears and angrily dismisses the crestfallen Nero . After Claudius departs , Poppaea brings Otho out of hiding and the two express their everlasting love in separate arias . 
 At the palace , Nero tells Agrippina of his troubles and decides to renounce love for political ambition ( " Come nube che fugge dal vento " ) . But Pallas and Narcissus have by now revealed Agrippina 's original plot to Claudius , so that when Agrippina urges the Emperor to yield the throne to Nero , he accuses her of treachery . She then claims that her efforts to secure the throne for Nero had all along been a ruse to safeguard the throne for Claudius ( " Se vuoi pace " ) . Claudius believes her ; nevertheless , when Poppaea , Otho , and Nero arrive , Claudius announces that Nero and Poppaea will marry , and that Otho shall have the throne . No one is satisfied with this arrangement , as their desires have all changed , so Claudius in a spirit of reconciliation reverses his judgement , giving Poppaea to Otho and the throne to Nero . He then summons the goddess Juno , who descends to pronounce a general blessing ( " V <unk> le <unk> i <unk> delle stelle " ) . 
 = = Performance history = = 
 = = = Premiere = = = 
 The date of Agrippina 's first performance , about which there was at one time some uncertainty , has been confirmed by a manuscript newsletter as 26 December 1709 . The cast consisted of some of Northern Italy 's leading singers of the day , including Antonio Carli in the lead bass role ; Margherita <unk> , who had recently sung the role of Mary Magdalene in Handel 's La <unk> ; and Diamante <unk> , whose great success at Bologna in the 1697 <unk> Perseo inspired the publication of a volume of eulogistic verse entitled La <unk> del Diamante . 
 Agrippina proved extremely popular and established Handel 's international reputation . Its original run of 27 performances was extraordinary for that time . Handel 's biographer John Mainwaring wrote of the first performance : " The theatre at almost every pause resounded with shouts of Viva il caro Sassone ! ( ' Long live the beloved Saxon ! ' ) They were thunderstruck with the grandeur and sublimity of his style , for they had never known till then all the powers of harmony and modulation so closely arranged and forcibly combined . " Many others recorded overwhelmingly positive responses to the work . 
 = = = Later performances = = = 
 Between 1713 and 1724 there were productions of Agrippina in Naples , Hamburg , and Vienna , although Handel himself never revived the opera after its initial run . The Naples production included additional music by Francesco Mancini . In the later 18th , and throughout the 19th centuries , Handel 's operas fell into obscurity , and none were staged between 1754 and 1920 . However , when interest in Handel 's operas awakened in the 20th century , Agrippina received several revivals , beginning with a 1943 production at Handel 's birthplace , Halle , under conductor Richard Kraus at the Halle Opera House . In this performance the alto role of Otho , composed for a woman , was changed into a bass accompanied by English horns , " with calamitous effects on the delicate balance and texture of the score " , according to Winton Dean . The Radio <unk> <unk> produced a live radio broadcast of the opera on 25 October 1953 , the opera 's first presentation other than on stage . The cast included Magda László in the title role and Mario Petri as Claudius , and the performance was conducted by Antonio <unk> . 
 A 1958 performance in Leipzig , and several more stagings in Germany , preceded the British première of the opera at Abingdon , Oxfordshire , in 1963 . In 1983 the opera returned to Venice , for a performance under Christopher Hogwood at the Teatro Malibran . In the United States a concert performance had been given on 16 February 1972 at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia , but the opera 's first fully staged American performance was in Fort Worth , Texas , in 1985 . That same year it reached New York , with a concert performance at Alice Tully Hall , where the opera was described as a " genuine rarity " . The Fort Worth performance was quickly followed by further American stagings in Iowa City and Boston . The historically informed performance movement inspired two period instrument productions of Agrippina in 1985 and 1991 respectively . Both were in Germany , the first was in the <unk> Schwetzingen , the other at the Göttingen International Handel Festival . 
 = = = 21st century revivals = = = 
 There have been numerous productions in the 21st century , including a 2002 ultramodern staging by director Lillian <unk> at the New York City Opera . This production , revived in 2007 , was described by the New York Times critic as " odd ... presented as broad satire , a Springtime for Hitler version of I , Claudius " , although the musical performances were generally praised . In Britain , the English National Opera ( ENO ) staged an English @-@ language version in February 2007 , directed by David McVicar , which received a broadly favourable critical response , although critic Fiona Maddocks identified features of the production that diminished the work : " Music so witty , inventive and humane requires no extra gilding " . Some of the later revivals used countertenors in the roles written for castrati . 
 = = Music = = 
 Agrippina is considered Handel 's first operatic masterpiece ; according to Winton Dean it has few rivals for its " sheer freshness of musical invention " . Grimani 's libretto has also been praised : The New Penguin Opera Guide describes it as one of the best Handel ever set , and praises the " light touch " with which the characters are vividly portrayed . Agrippina as a whole is , in the view of the scholar John E. Sawyer , " among the most convincing of all the composer 's dramatic works " . 
 = = = Style = = = 
 Stylistically , Agrippina follows the standard pattern of the era by alternating recitative and da capo arias . In accordance with 18th @-@ century opera convention the plot is mainly carried forward in the recitatives , while the musical interest and exploration of character takes place in the arias — although on occasion Handel breaks this mould by using arias to advance the action . With one exception the recitative sections are secco ( " dry " ) , where a simple vocal line is accompanied by continuo only . The anomaly is Otho 's " Otton , qual <unk> <unk> " , where he finds himself robbed of the throne and deserted by his beloved Poppaea ; here the recitative is accompanied by the orchestra , as a means of highlighting the drama . Dean and Knapp describe this , and the Otho 's aria which follows , as " the peak of the opera " . The 19th @-@ century musical theorist Ebenezer Prout singles out Agrippina 's " Non ho cor che per amarti " for special praise . He points out the range of instruments used for special effects , and writes that " an examination of the score of this air would probably astonish some who think Handel 's orchestration is wanting in variety . " 
 Handel made more use than was then usual of orchestral accompaniment in arias , but in other respects Agrippina is broadly typical of an older operatic tradition . For the most part the arias are brief , there are only two short ensembles , and in the quartet and the trio the voices are not heard together . However , Handel 's style would change very little in the next 30 years , a point reflected in the reviews of the Tully Hall performance of Agrippina in 1985 , which refer to a " string of melodious aria and ensembles , any of which could be mistaken for the work of his mature London years " . 
 = = = Character = = = 
 Of the main characters , only Otho is not morally contemptible . Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer ; Nero , while not yet the monster he would become , is pampered and hypocritical ; Claudius is pompous , complacent , and something of a buffoon , while Poppaea , the first of Handel 's sex kittens , is also a liar and a flirt . The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self @-@ serving and salacious . All , however , have some redeeming features , and all have arias that express genuine emotion . The situations in which they find themselves are sometimes comic , but never farcical — like Mozart in the Da Ponte operas , Handel avoids laughing at his characters . 
 In Agrippina the da capo aria is the musical form used to illustrate character in the context of the opera . The first four arias of the work exemplify this : Nero 's " Con <unk> " , in a minor key and with a descending figure on the key phrase " il <unk> <unk> " ( " I will ascend the throne " ) characterises him as weak and <unk> . Pallas 's first aria " La mia sorte <unk> " , with its " wide @-@ leaping melodic phrasing " introduces him as a bold , heroic figure , contrasting with his rival Narcissus whose introspective nature is displayed in his delicate aria " Volo <unk> " which immediately follows . Agrippina 's introductory aria " L <unk> mia " has a mock @-@ military form which reflects her outward power , while subtle musical phrasing establishes her real emotional state . Poppaea 's arias are uniformly light and rhythmic , while Claudius 's short love song " Vieni O cara " gives a glimpse of his inner feelings , and is considered one of the gems of the score . 
 = = = Irony = = = 
 Grimani 's libretto is full of irony , which Handel reflects in the music . His settings sometimes illustrate both the surface meaning , as characters attempt to deceive each other , and the hidden truth . For instance , in her Act I aria " Non ho cor che per amarti " Agrippina promises Poppaea that deceit will never mar their new friendship , while tricking her into ruining Otho 's chances for the throne . Handel 's music illuminates her deceit in the melody and minor modal key , while a simple , emphasised rhythmic accompaniment hints at clarity and openness . In Act III , Nero 's announcement that his passion is ended and that he will no longer bound by it ( in " Come nube che fugge dal vento " ) is set to bitter @-@ sweet music which suggests that he is deceiving himself . In Otho 's " <unk> il crin " the agitated nature of the music is the opposite of what the " euphoric " tone of the libretto suggests . Contrasts between the force of the libretto and the emotional colour of the actual music would develop into a constant feature of Handel 's later London operas .

 = 2002 – 03 Australian region cyclone season = 
 The 2002 – 03 Australian region cyclone season included Cyclone Inigo , which tied Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 as the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian basin . It began on 1 November 2002 and ended on 30 April 2003 . The regional tropical cyclone operational plan also defines a tropical cyclone year separately from a tropical cyclone season , which runs from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Australian region , which is defined as in the southern hemisphere between 90 ° E and 180 ° E. The season 's ten tropical depressions existed within these dates , with the first , designated as Tropical Cyclone 07S , entering the basin on 27 December 2002 . The last system , Cyclone Epi , dissipated on 6 June 2003 . Tropical cyclones in this area were monitored by four Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres ( TCWCs ) : the Australian Bureau of Meteorology ( BOM ) in Perth , Darwin , and Brisbane and one in Port Moresby , Papua New Guinea . 
 Tropical cyclogenesis in the season began when a tropical low developed in the Arafura Sea on 5 January and last until 24 January , after meandering over northern and Western Australia . On 1 February , weakening Cyclone Beni entered the Australian region and brought severe flooding to Queensland , before dissipating on 5 February . Severe Tropical Cyclone Fiona formed north of Western Australia on 3 February and later peaked as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale . Cyclone Graham developed offshore Western Australia on 24 February and made landfall in a rural area of that state on 28 February , producing flooding in the area . Tropical Cyclone Harriet existed offshore of Western Australia from 1 March to 11 March . 
 On 1 March , Cyclone Erica formed offshore Queensland and strengthened as it moved in a parabolic path , before leaving the Australian region on 12 March . Erica caused only minor damage in Queensland . Cyclone Craig originated offshore Northern Territory on 8 March . The system subsequently struck the territory and eventually made another landfall in Queensland on 12 March , after crossing the Gulf of Carpentaria . Impact from Craig was generally minor . Cyclone Inigo formed on 30 March and caused severe impact in Indonesia , especially in Flores , Sumba , and West Timor . Inigo later deepened into the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region , tied with Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 . Inigo weakened significantly before striking Western Australia on 8 April and dissipating shortly thereafter . The final system , Tropical Cyclone Epi developed east of Papua New Guinea on 5 June and dissipated on the following day . Overall , the tropical cyclones of this season caused 60 deaths and about $ 12 million ( 2003 USD ) in damage . 
 = = Seasonal summary = = 
 The season began on 1 November 2002 and ended on 30 April 2003 , while the regional tropical cyclone operational plan also defines a tropical cyclone year from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 . Eight cyclones entered or formed in the Australian region , which was below the 1970 @-@ 71 to 2001 @-@ 02 average of 13 per season . There was a major shift in tropical cyclone activity from the Australian region to the South Pacific , because of a moderate El Niño event . Only two cyclones occurred between 125 ° E and 150 ° E , which is east of Australia , and six formed between 150 ° E and 160 ° E. All of the tropical cyclone developed during Madden – Julian oscillation ( MJO ) pulses or Equatorial Rossby ( ER ) pulses . Overall , the tropical cyclones of this season resulted in 60 deaths and slightly less than $ 12 million in damage . 
 Activity began in December 2002 , when Tropical Cyclone 07S entered the Australian region from the southwestern Indian Ocean basin on 27 December . In January , an unnamed tropical cyclone existed for more than three weeks over the Arafura Sea , Northern Territory , and Western Australia . The basin became more active in February , with South Pacific Cyclone Beni entering the area on 1 February . This was followed by the development of Fiona on 3 February and Graham on 24 February ; both formed north of Western Australia . Two tropical cyclones – Harriet and Erica – both originated on 1 March ; the former developed northwest of Western Australia and the latter formed east of Queensland . About a week later , 8 March , Cyclone Craig developed near the coast of Northern Territory . The strongest tropical system of the season , Cyclone Inigo , originated over the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia on 30 March . At peak intensity , Inigo had a minimum barometric pressure of 900 mbar ( 27 inHg ) , making the most intense tropical cyclone in the Australian region on record , tied with Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 . Activity remained dormant until the development of Cyclone Epi on 5 June , which dissipated on the following day .

 Tropical Cyclone 07S developed in the southwestern Indian Ocean on 25 December , while located about 1345 km ( 835 mi ) west @-@ northwest of Cocos Islands . It initially drifted southwest and then turned eastward on 27 December . Around this time , 07S entered Perth 's Area Of Responsibility ( AOR ) . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) estimated that 07S peaked with 1 @-@ minute maximum sustained winds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 006 mbar ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) . The storm drifted erratically and by 1800 UTC on 28 December , the JTWC issued its final warning on 07S , while situated about 465 km ( 290 mi ) west @-@ northwest of Cocos Islands . However , TCWC Perth continued Tropical Weather Outlooks ( TWOs ) on the system until 3 January . 
 = = = Unnamed tropical cyclone = = = 
 A tropical low developed over the Arafura Sea on 4 January and strengthened into a tropical cyclone before passing near Elcho Island , Northern Territory . The storm then made landfall in Arnhem Land on 5 January . At 0900 UTC , the system peaked with winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . It meandered over Northern Territory and the Gulf of Carpentaria for a few weeks . The system remained inland until moving offshore Kimberley on 21 January . A deep trough generated wind shear , which inhibited significant intensification . However , deep convection began to develop late on 24 January as it approached the north coast of Western Australia . Around 0300 UTC on 25 January , the storm made landfall near Port Hedland with winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . The system quickly weakened and dissipated by 1200 UTC . 
 Gale force winds caused damage vegetation , trees , vehicles , and buildings in Elcho Island , <unk> , Maningrida , and Ramingining . Wind @-@ driven waves at the mouth of the Rose River inundated workshops near <unk> . Torrential rains fell in the Roper @-@ McArthur River district , peaking at 880 mm ( 35 in ) at Wollogorang . A temporary evacuated occurred along the Waterhouse River at Beswick . Other rivers that overflowed inundated portions of highways such as the Carpentaria Highway and Tablelands Highway . After regenerating into a tropical cyclone , the storm brought up to 146 @.@ 6 mm ( 5 @.@ 77 in ) of rainfall in a 24 ‑ hour period in the Port Hedland area . This caused the Yule River to overflow its banks , which flooded the North @-@ West Highway . Operationally , the storm was thought to have been two separate systems and to have remained below tropical cyclone intensity . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Beni = = = 
 Beni originated from the South Pacific region in late January and its remnants crossed into the Australian region by 1 February . Upon reaching the Coral Sea , the remnants of Beni slowly began to redevelop . After strong convective bands formed , Brisbane TCWC initiated gale warnings . Located offshore Queensland on 4 February , the remnants of Beni regenerated into a tropical cyclone . However , strong vertical wind shear caused Beni to dissipated on 5 February , while situated offshore of Queensland near the city of Mackay . 
 Heavy rainfall accompanied Beni and its remnants , reaching 500 mm ( 20 in ) near Gladstone . One person drowned due to the flooding rains . Runoff on the Fitzroy River caused by Cyclone Beni resulted in a moderate flood with an estimated return period of four years at Rockhampton . The cyclone 's heavy rains helped ease drought problems in Queensland . Nine shires in Central Queensland were declared disaster areas . Additionally , strong winds left power outages in Agnes Water and 1770 . Overall , Beni resulted in damages of at least A $ 10 million ( US $ 6 million ) in Queensland .

 = = = Severe Tropical Cyclone Fiona = = = 
 An area of convection began developing into a tropical low on 3 February , while located about 970 km ( 600 mi ) north of Karratha , Western Australia . Poorly @-@ defined convection was noted as well as good outflow and a weak circulation . The system drifted westward with minimal development until late on 4 February , when satellite imagery showed increasing convection near the center . Subsequently , the JTWC issued a TCFA for the system . With the developing low located in an environment of weak to moderate wind shear , TCWC Perth issued a warning . At 0700 UTC on 5 February , Perth named the system Fiona . The JTWC issued their first advisory on Fiona about five hours later . Fiona strengthened steadily and reached tropical cyclone intensity at 0600 UTC on 6 February . Continuing to intensify , TCWC Perth upgraded the storm to severe tropical cyclone status early on 7 February . 
 Early on 8 February , an eye became embedded within partial concentric convective bands . Later that day , TCWC Perth reported a peak intensity of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) at 1000 UTC . Shortly thereafter , the storm began weakening as dry air increased . By 1000 UTC on 9 February , TCWC Perth reduced the intensity of Fiona to 170 km / h ( 105 mph ) . Deep convection weakened somewhat and the eye had become cloud @-@ filled . Although the eye briefly redeveloped , water vapor imagery showed cooler and drier air entering the southern portion of the storm . Fiona began to turn southwestward as it neared the 90 ° E longitude . By late 12 February , Fiona weakened below gale force intensity . Moving steadily southward , it then re @-@ curved south @-@ southeastward along the 91 ° E. With the storm rapidly weakening , JTWC issued their final warning early on 13 February and Perth followed suit four hours later . The remnants of Fiona moved into the Great Australian Bight , leading to significant amounts of rainfall . The Eyre Peninsula and Adelaide recorded more rain in 24 hours than they had in 2002 and 2001 combined . The New South Wales saw major flooding events in towns such as Tamworth . Flooding also closed the Pacific Highway . Over 100 houses along the Gold Coast were damaged due to the torrential rains . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Graham = = = 
 In late February , an area of convection situated inland for roughly a week emerged over open waters along the northern coast of Australia . A tropical low formed on 24 February , and developed a banding feature by 25 February . Despite strong wind shear , the BOM began issuing warnings while the low was located several hundred kilometers north @-@ northeast of Port Hedland . The disturbance was initially nearly stationary . At 0700 UTC on 27 February , the JTWC designated the storm as Tropical Cyclone Graham . According to the JTWC , the storm had intensified late on 28 February , though the BOM noted the slight weakening of the storm . Graham reached its peak intensity that day with winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) , while nearing the coast . The storm made landfall at Eighty Mile Beach , Western Australia at 1400 UTC on 28 February . Graham weakened and dissipated on 1 March . 
 The storm dropped rainfall in Western Australia , with 175 mm ( 6 @.@ 9 in ) recorded at Telfer . The heavy rain caused flooding and road closures , and swelled a river passing through Fitzroy Crossing , though the river only topped its banks slightly . In nearby Blue Bush Creek , two men drowned as their group of people attempted to cross floodwaters . Both men were rescued , though one died before emergency services arrived . In addition to the flooding , a number of trees were downed . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Harriet = = = 
 A tropical low developed southwest of Christmas Island on 28 February . Perth TCWC issued a TWO on 1 March , which indicated an eastward @-@ moving 1 @,@ 005 mb ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) low . At 0600 UTC on 2 March , the JTWC initiated warnings on Tropical Cyclone 21S , estimating winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . The system maintained a well @-@ defined circulation , although deep convection diminished somewhat on 2 March . Later that day , Perth began issuing gale warnings on the low as it was expected to develop into a tropical cyclone . Moving eastward , convection increased near the center , though dry air inhibited much development . At 0400 UTC on 4 March , the TCWC Perth named the system Tropical Cyclone Harriet . 
 On 5 March , JTWC briefly decreased the intensity of Harriett to 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) , as deep convection diminished , probably due to persistent dry air . By late on 5 March , convection increased in coverage . Based on this , TCWC Perth upped their intensity to 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) . Late on 5 March , Harriet moved slowly southward and curved west @-@ southwestward . Although convection fluctuated , the cyclone maintained its intensity . After deep convection decreased slightly , the JTWC lowered the intensity of Harriett to 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . However , TCWC Perth suggested otherwise and on 8 March , Harriet peaked with winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) , while located over 480 km ( 300 mi ) north @-@ northwest of Carnarvon . Early on 9 March , JTWC issued their final advisory on Harriet . The storm became extratropical at 1000 UTC on 9 March , while located about 580 km ( 360 mi ) west @-@ northwest of Carnarvon . Strong winds from Harriet contributed to a large bushfire near Walpole , Western Australia . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Cyclone Erica = = = 
 A monsoon trough strengthened into a tropical low on 1 March . The low then significantly organized and was named Erica on 4 March , just offshore Queensland . Early on 5 March , the JTWC began classifying the system as Tropical Cyclone 22S . Moving slowly southeastward and then northward under the influence of a weak mid @-@ level ridge to the east , Erica attained 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . However , Erica soon weakened due to strong wind shear . On 7 March , the cyclone degenerated into a tropical low . After the remnants curved eastward and then southeastward , wind shear abated and became favorable for tropical cyclogenesis . As a result , the low regenerated into a tropical cyclone . After attaining the equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale , Erica entered the South Pacific basin on 12 March . 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Erica was a powerful cyclone that severely affected New Caledonia and was considered the worst to affect the country since Cyclone Beti in 1996 . Early in its existence while just offshore Queensland , the predecessor to Erica brought strong winds to the coast . Several trees were uprooted , and others were <unk> . Power lines were also damaged . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Craig = = = 
 TCWC Darwin began monitoring a tropical low that developed west of Darwin on 5 March . Early on 8 March , the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 24S . At 0300 UTC on 9 March , the storm became Tropical Cyclone Craig , while situated northwest of Cape Fourcroy . The storm deepened and drifted eastward and then southeastward . On 10 March , Craig made landfall on Melville Island with winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . Upon emerging into the Van Diemen Gulf on 10 March , Craig peaked with sustained winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) . Craig struck the Coburg Peninsula and began to slowly weaken inland . The storm reached the Gulf of Carpentaria on 11 March , where it accelerated southeastward . On 12 March at 0600 UTC , the cyclone made landfall south of Kowanyama . After moving inland , the storm quickly weakened and dissipated later that day . 
 In advance of the storm , tropical cyclone advisories were issued for communities between Weipa and Mornington Island . The government of the Tiwi Islands evacuated some residents to shelters . In the Darwin area , certain schools were closed temporarily as a precaution . Impact from Craig was generally minor . At Ramingining , 164 mm ( 6 @.@ 5 in ) of rain fell in just 24 hours . Storm surge ran 2 to 2 @.@ 5 m ( 6 @.@ 6 to 8 @.@ 2 ft ) on Goulburn Island and the Cobourg Peninsula , while tides were estimated at 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) at <unk> . Strong winds at Maningrida and Kowanyama downed numerous trees , with one striking a house in the latter . Craig inflicted minor damage to small craft in the northwestern Gulf of Carpentaria . Throughout the region , roads were cut by the cyclone . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Cyclone Inigo = = = 
 An area of disturbed weather was located within the near @-@ equatorial trough near Papua New Guinea in late March . Despite easterly wind shear , a tropical low developed on 30 March , shortly before crossing the island of Flores . Decreasing wind shear allowed the low to strengthen into a tropical cyclone while crossing the Savu Sea on 1 April . Later that day , the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 26S . On 2 April , BOM classified the low as Tropical Cyclone Inigo . An eye feature gradually organized as winds increased to 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) early on 3 April . As a result , the BOM began classifying Inigo as a severe tropical cyclone . Later on 3 April , low wind shear and strong divergence allowed the cyclone to undergo rapid intensification as the eye became well @-@ defined . 
 At 0600 UTC 4 April , Inigo peaked with sustained winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , according to BOM . Based on the pressure @-@ wind relationship , it was estimated that Inigo reached a minimum barometric pressure of 900 mbar ( 27 inHg ) . Thus , the storm tied with Cyclone Gwenda as the most intense tropical cyclone in the Australian cyclone region . Simultaneously , JTWC indicated the Inigo peaked with sustained winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) . However , later on 4 April , increasing wind shear began to weaken Inigo . On the following day , the eye became cloud @-@ filled and by 7 April , Inigo weakened to Category 2 status . Inigo made landfall in the Pilbara region of Western Australia on 8 April with winds of 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) . The circulation dissipated within 12 hours after moving ashore . 
 The precursor tropical disturbance dropped heavy rainfall in eastern Indonesia . In Kupang on West Timor , the system destroyed hundreds of homes and large fields of corn , bean , and rice crop . Heavy damage was reported near Ende , where flooding and mudslides destroyed 20 houses and destroyed the roads connecting to East Flores . In Ende , a total of 294 animals were killed . In East Flores Regency in eastern Flores Island , the system left 75 destroyed houses , along with 77 severely damaged and a further 56 receiving light damage . Damage in Indonesia totaled less than $ 6 million , and 102 injuries were reported . In addition , 58 fatalities were reported . In Australia , the storm dropped 128 mm ( 5 @.@ 04 in ) of rain in 80 minutes .

 In early June , an area of fairly persistent convection stretched from Papua New Guinea to just north of Fiji . Around 0630 UTC on 5 June , Epi developed near <unk> Island , unusually close to the Equator . Initially , the storm appeared to be undergoing rapid deepening , prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA . However , strong wind shear caused the system to quickly become less organized and the TCFA was soon cancelled . A very short lived cyclone , a Papua New Guinea warning during the late morning hour of 5 June placed Epi 's center about 130 km ( 80 mi ) northeast of <unk> Island . Never recognized as a tropical cyclone by the JTWC , the third and final warning was issued later that day after winds fell below gale force .

 " Love Machine " is a song recorded by British girl group Girls Aloud from their second studio album , What Will the Neighbours Say ? ( 2004 ) . It was released by Polydor Records on 13 September 2004 , as the second single from the album . The song was written by Miranda Cooper , Brian Higgins , Tim Powell , Nick Coler , Lisa Cowling , Myra Boyle , and Shawn Lee . The instrumentation was inspired by The Smiths , and created by Powell and Coler . " Love Machine " is an uptempo pop rock and teen pop song with elements of the 1980 synthpop . The single was received favourably by contemporary music critics , who deemed it as joyful track that was different from the single releases by other artists at the time . According to research carried out for Nokia in 2006 , " Love Machine " is the second " most exhilarating " song ever . 
 " Love Machine " debuted and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart , continuing the band 's string of hits by becoming their sixth consecutive single to chart within the top three . The song also peaked inside the top ten in Europe and Ireland . The accompanying music video was directed by Stuart Gosling , and portrays the five members in a nightclub / restaurant scene dancing and sipping champagne whilst singing their pop number . Girls Aloud performed " Love Machine " on all of their tours and on several live appearances , including at Disney Channel Kids Awards , TMF Awards 2005 , and at The Girls Aloud Party TV special in 2008 . English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys covered the song on BBC Radio 1 's Live Lounge .

 Following a brief hiatus , Polydor Records enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania to produce Girls Aloud 's second album in its entirety , following the success of their debut album Sound of the Underground . Higgins explained that Polydor were not going to continue with the group 's contract unless he produced songs for the album . He continued , saying that his initial reaction was that he thought he would only be required to produce a couple of songs , however Polydor insisted that he produce the album in its entirety and that they thought only he understood what they wanted . The album was recorded from April to September 2004 , although its lead single " The Show " was released in June 2004 . Bandmate Nicola Roberts said that " Love Machine " was recorded in 18 parts over three days . Roberts also revealed that the band initially was in disagreement with Polydor regarding its release as a single , with Sarah Harding adding that all the girls wanted to release " Deadlines & Diets " instead . 
 However , " Love Machine " was picked as the second single from What Will the Neighbours Say ? , being released on 13 September 2004 . " The pressure to come up with singles was , as always , immense . But [ ... ] we were able to have a lot of fun working on ideas that were maybe a little too odd to be on the radio , " Higgins said . It was released on three different CD single formats , as well as an additional 7 " picture disc , making it Girls Aloud 's first single available on vinyl . The first disc included a Flip & Fill remix of " The Show " . For the sleeve of the second CD , Artwork design group Form invented five fake magazines , one for each member , and used " Love Machine " lyrics as the headlines . The disc included an exclusive previously unreleased b @-@ side entitled " Androgynous Girls " , which had been initially considered to be released as the lead single of the album . The Gravitas Disco Mix of " Love Machine " was also included . The maxi @-@ CD also included a task @-@ based game , created by design agency Holler . The 7 " picture disc included the radio edit and Tony Lamezma Remix of " Love Machine " .

 " Love Machine " was written by Miranda Cooper , Brian Higgins , Tim Powell , Nick Coler , Lisa Cowling , Myra Boyle , Shawn Lee . They came up with some of the song 's lyrics by singing " nonsense lyrics " over a backing track , which eventually evolved into real <unk> . The instrumentation track was inspired by The Smiths , and created by Powell and Coler . It is a pop rock and teen pop written in C major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 88 beats per minute . The vocal range from the band members spans from F3 to B4 . An early demo of " Love Machine " was included on the compilation album Popjustice : 100 % Solid Pop Music , and later on an official Girls Aloud singles boxset ; this version was sung by band members Cheryl Cole , Nadine Coyle and Sarah Harding only , and featured radically different lyrics from the released version , even excluding the phrase " Love Machine " . One of the song 's lyrics , " What will the neighbours say / This time ? " inspired the album 's title , and it is a reference to Girls Aloud 's debut single , where Cole sings , " Neighbours banging on the bathroom wall " . MusicOMH contributor John Murphy noted the track uses " a guitar line that sounds like it 's been nicked from an old rockabilly tune " , and compared its composition to other " ' 80s synth pop songs . "

 The track received generally favourable reviews from music critics . Alexis Petridis of The Guardian considered " The Show " and " Love Machine " as the " perfect examples of Xenomania 's uniquely rousing approach to pop , " adding that the latter " sounds , incredibly , like the Smiths ' Rusholme Ruffians colliding head @-@ on with that band 's musical nemesis , chirpy 1980s synth @-@ pop . " A reviewer for Virgin Media stated the song 's " bouncy drums , perky guitars and ditsy lyrics will probably cause a seizure , " and commented further , saying that " it sounds so unlike anything else in the charts right now ... proving once again that they 're still one of the most exciting bands in pop right now . " The song was a Track Pick from the Allmusic review of What Will the Neighbours Say ? by Sharon Mawer , while Robert Copsey of Digital Spy stated that , despite having many previous releases , it wasn 't until " Love Machine " , " a swinging , big band track with ludicrous lyrics – that they were thrust into the wider public consciousness . " A BBC Music critic , however , called it " upbeat but not particularly tuneful " . According to research carried out for Nokia in 2006 , " Love Machine " is the second " most exhilarating " song ever , after " Song 2 " by Blur .

 On the week ending 2 October 2004 , " Love Machine " debuted at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart , being held of the top spot by " Call on Me " by Eric Prydz .

The song also reached number six on the UK Downloads Chart , and eventually became the band 's 7th best @-@ selling single in the UK . " Love Machine " also debuted and peaked at number 8 on the European Hot 100 Singles , staying on the top ten for two weeks . In Ireland , the song debuted at number nine on 16 September 2004 , and remained at the same position for three weeks , becoming Girls Aloud 's first single to fail to enter the top five . It spent one last week in the top ten at number ten . " Love Machine " also entered the Dutch chart Single Top 100 on 14 May 2005 at number 52 , before falling of the chart after 4 weeks .

 The accompanying music video for " Love Machine " was directed by Stuart Gosling for Image Dynamic Pictures , and filmed at the Titanic restaurant on London 's Brewer Street . Gosling shot the project on 35mm film to give it the desired sleek , stylised , polished and glossy look . Girls Aloud members stopped in at Camden Post to view the footage and were impressed with the final results of it . The video depicts a nightclub / restaurant scene with the five women dancing and sipping champagne at the location whilst singing their pop number . A caption at the start of the video identifies the location as " The Eskimo Club " , which explains the otherwise meaningless song lyrics " Let 's go eskimo " .

 The Doug Anthony All Stars ( or Doug Anthony Allstars , DAAS , <unk> or stylised as D <unk> A † A <unk> S ) are an Australian musical comedy , alternative rock and vocal group who initially performed together between 1984 and 1994 . The band is an acoustic trio , originally comprising Paul McDermott and Tim Ferguson on main vocals and Richard Fidler on guitar and backing vocals . The 2014 DAAS Live reformation tour features Paul Livingston ( aka Flacco ) on guitar and vibes . 
 DAAS are known for their aggressive , provocative style ; their habit of involving audience members and their tendency to attack topical and sometimes controversial issues in their comedy . 
 DAAS began performing as buskers on the streets of Canberra in 1984 , while they were attending university . After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival , the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne , but it was not until they travelled to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1987 that they first achieved success . They quickly gained popularity in the United Kingdom , where they made numerous television appearances , but remained virtually unknown in Australia until 1989 when they were made regular performers on the Australian comedy show The Big Gig . These appearances gained them recognition , and they remained a popular feature of the show until 1991 when they left to create their own ABC comedy series , DAAS Kapital . 
 The group have released four live recordings and one studio album , DAAS Icon , which achieved some independent success in Australia but was briefly banned in Britain . They also released a collection of dark short stories in 1989 , entitled Book , which took a markedly different tone from their comedic stage performances . They also made two live concert videos and one film , The Edinburgh Years . The group split up in 1994 , following a final farewell tour of Australia . Although they reunited in 2003 to perform together at a benefit concert , were interviewed together in 2008 in support of their DVD , and reunited for a one @-@ off show to launch the DAAS Kapital DVD in 2013 , the three ruled out the suggestion of a reunion tour at the time . 
 In December 2013 , McDermott and Ferguson announced they would be performing " as DAAS " for the group 's 30th anniversary , at the Canberra Comedy Festival in March 2014 , with Paul Livingston performing the role of Fidler . This current line @-@ up has announced subsequent shows in Hobart , Melbourne , Wollongong , Perth , Brisbane and Bendigo , with more dates to follow . 
 = = Style = = 
 DAAS employ an aggressive , confrontational style , which author and journalist Geoff Bartlett describes as " [ pushing ] the boundaries of humour and good taste to their absolute limits " . They frequently delve into topical and taboo subject matter with songs such as " <unk> for Christ " and " I Fuck Dogs " . " Long before anyone knew the term , one of our greatest driving forces was to be politically incorrect , " said Ferguson . Each band member developed distinctive onstage characters , with McDermott adopting a nasty , mean persona , while Ferguson played a narcissistic character who was " gorgeous but stupid " . Fidler initially played the straight man , but as the group became more aggressive he developed into a character who was naturally happy and caring but frequently victimised by his fellow band members . 
 The group drew inspiration from short @-@ lived punk bands like the Fat <unk> , The Lone Reagans and Forbidden Mule , whom Ferguson describes as " like all punk bands ... very fast and furious . " Much of the band 's provocative style emerged from their origins as street performers , where to get people 's attention they resorted to outrageous or theatrical tactics — the group would sometimes walk into the street and stop traffic to get noticed . " Sometimes we have to do really ugly or horrendous things to get people 's attention , and we 're not afraid to do that . We 'll hit someone if it gets a bit of discourse going , " said McDermott . 
 Neil Pigot , who did some work with the group , describes their style as " a sort of extension of the Python tradition , but very much in an Australian context . " He says that DAAS were " crucially important " in the development of Australian comedy , directly contributing to the styles of successful comedy shows such as The D @-@ Generation , Fast Forward and <unk> Out of Work . At the time DAAS emerged , Pigot says , comedy in Australia was dominated by joke @-@ tellers and impersonators . By contrast , DAAS were belligerent and confrontational , frequently attacking topical issues , invading people 's personal space and involving the audience in their act . Mark Trevorrow , who frequently collaborated with the group , described their work as " true genius . " " Their great shows were among the greatest evenings I 've witnessed in my life and their worst shows were among the worst , " he said . " They 'd whip up an audience and appeal to people 's darker side . It was very Dada , what they were doing . And what happens with that is you 're just as often likely to have people who want to kill you as applaud you . " In addition , ABC comedy producer Ted Robinson says that the group played an important role in raising the profile of Australian comedy overseas , particularly in Britain where DAAS were very popular . British comedian Al Murray said of seeing the group at the Edinburgh Festival in 1988 , " they came onstage with the attitude of feral invaders and left it with no taboo untouched . " Describing the All Stars as " an insanely hot act from Oz who sang , cursed , sweated and insulted each other and their audiences with a level of commitment and polish that seemed exotically charged and almost transgressive in the late 80s . " 
 DAAS were known for continuing to act , or to remain in character , during interviews . Much of this was just banter , but they also had serious messages . DAAS were often criticising the media and part of this was to tell outrageous lies to journalists during interviews and attempt to see them published as fact . In one of the best @-@ known instances of this , the group told British reporters that their namesake , former Australian politician Doug Anthony , was a much @-@ loved Prime Minister of Australia who had been assassinated on 11 November 1975 , by right wing extremists . ( In fact , Anthony is a former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia who had led the right @-@ of @-@ center National Party of Australia from 1971 to 1984 . ) The lie was printed in The Times , The Guardian and The Independent . This game continued undetected until in 1990 the group told a reporter that they had been cast in Batman and had become great friends with Jack Nicholson , both lies . The story was reported as fact in newspapers around Australia and appeared as a cover story in the TV guide of Melbourne 's Herald Sun before the media realised the hoax .

 Tim Ferguson met Richard Fidler busking on the streets of Canberra in 1984 , while they were both attending university . Ferguson recalls : " Richard was playing the guitar — something from Cat Stevens — one day and I walked up to him and we did ' Wild Thing ' . I sang a few lyrics and jumped about like a mad thing . Lo and behold we made a stack of money in ten minutes . " The two began performing together and joined with another friend , Robert Piper , to form the Doug Anthony All Stars . They derived their name from Doug Anthony , a former Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia . According to Fidler , during their earlier gigs in clubs and as street performers , Ferguson was " a bit of an explosive hippie " while Fidler and Piper were more reserved . Robert Piper left the group in 1985 due to other commitments . Piper has gone on to a successful career with the United Nations and is now Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and the humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory . 
 With Piper 's departure , Paul McDermott , who performed at one of DAAS 's regular clubs , was invited to join . He accepted , although he did not like their material , which he considered too sweet . Fidler says McDermott changed the group 's dynamic ; he wrote the majority of their songs and prompted a darker tone . After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival , the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne , where they based themselves with a regular gig at the Prince Patrick Hotel in Collingwood , in an effort to save enough money to travel to the Edinburgh Fringe . Initially DAAS found that Melbourne audiences did not respond to their act and to provoke a reaction they became more aggressive , with McDermott and Ferguson adopting more abusive personas and often picking on Fidler 's naturally happy but stupid character . They made their first overseas performance at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1987 , to sold out crowds . 
 = = = Successes = = = 
 Following their Edinburgh Fringe shows , the group enjoyed considerable success in the United Kingdom , making appearances on numerous BBC comedy shows . In 1988 , the group was nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award for their performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe . Fidler says that the British people were more receptive to their act at the time than Australians had been . " The whole thing exploded for us when we got there , it was quite incredible . Within a very short time we were doing national television appearances in front of millions of people and playing these enormous shows , " he says . They played extensively in Canada , Germany , America and Britain , and finished their time in Britain by appearing on the final episode of the successful Friday Night Live . However , despite the acclaim they were receiving overseas , when they returned to Australia at the end of 1988 they remained unknown . Upon arriving in Melbourne , they struggled to gain a following and went back to busking on the streets . 
 This changed in 1989 when ABC comedy producer Ted Robinson invited them to appear on a new comedy show , The Big Gig . They became a popular feature on the series and appeared in every episode until 1991 . In 1989 the group also released a book entitled Book , which was a collection of dark short stories . Many of the stories had been written several years prior , even before the three had started performing together , and adopted a markedly different tone to their comedic , largely ad libbed live shows . Ferguson said that they had wanted to write something that people could read and enjoy without having seen DAAS perform . Book sold 30 @,@ 000 copies in England within the first two weeks of publication before being banned when DAAS refused to release an edited version of the book or permit a warning sticker on the cover . The issue was taken to court in the same year , where the ban was overturned . 
 DAAS released their first official album , DAAS Icon , in 1990 . Two of the featured songs , " I Want to Spill the Blood of a Hippy " and " Bottle " , were also released as singles . Icon went on to become the highest selling independent album in Australia , but was banned in the UK due to a reference to the IRA in the song " <unk> " . This was later overturned by a British court . The group continued to appear weekly on The Big Gig until 1991 when their own series , DAAS Kapital , premiered on the ABC . A futuristic half @-@ hour @-@ long sitcom about the band 's adventures in an underwater history museum , DAAS Kapital ran for two seven @-@ episode seasons between 1991 and 1992 despite a poor critical reaction . From 1992 they became UK @-@ based , returning to Australia for a short time in 1993 to promote Dead & Alive , a live recording of one of their London shows which was released on CD and VHS . They played at the opening of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and appeared regularly on Britain 's Channel 4 variety show Viva Cabaret . 
 = = = Break @-@ up and reformation = = = 
 The group held a final farewell tour of Australia in 1994 , which was recorded and released on CD by ABC Records as DAAS : The Last Concert . The break @-@ up sparked rumours of a falling out among the trio , although all three denied this , stating that it was simply time to move on . Richard Fidler described it as a matter of practicality : Ferguson wanted to return to Australia to be closer to his young family , while McDermott and Fidler wished to continue working in Britain as they felt they had done everything they had wanted to do in Australia . 
 In June 2010 , Tim Ferguson revealed that the break @-@ up was due in large part to personal health issues . Unknown to the public at the time , Ferguson had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996 after experiencing symptoms for several years including a few severe episodes while touring in 1993 . The symptoms affected his mobility , causing him to struggle with choreography and physical routines onstage and eventually , he says , " it was clear I couldn 't remain a Doug Anthony Allstar with whatever this was " . Still coming to terms with his diagnosis , Ferguson chose to keep it private , telling few people outside of his close friends and family . " I didn 't want other people to know , " he says . " I didn 't want it to be coming up in conversation with strangers . " 
 In July 2003 , DAAS reunited for the first time since their break @-@ up to perform at a special gala comedy event called " For Holly " . Dedicated to the memory of Holly Robinson — a casting director for Home and Away and the daughter of The Big Gig 's Ted Robinson — who had died of cancer the month before , the concert was a fundraising benefit for research into the disease . At Holly 's request , the three also performed the Hunters & Collectors ' " Throw Your Arms Around Me " , a song they had frequently covered in the group 's later years , at her funeral . 
 A DAAS DVD entitled The Unlimited <unk> Sterling Deluxe Edition , a 2 @-@ disc collection of their performances from the first two seasons of The Big Gig , was released on 6 November 2008 . Ferguson , Fidler and McDermott recorded a commentary track for the DVD and made several media appearances together to promote its release , but the three ruled out the prospect of a reunion tour . " We certainly catch up for barbecues , but not as a comedy group , " McDermott said . 
 DAAS reunited for a one @-@ off show to launch the DVD of the TV series DAAS Kapital on 13 April 2013 as part of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival . 
 McDermott , Ferguson and Paul Livingston ( performing the role of Fidler ) performed " as DAAS " for their 30th anniversary at the Canberra Comedy Festival , held in March 2014 . They have since permanently reformed the band , and are doing an Australia @-@ wide tour . Although Fidler had been advocating for the group to reform for years , his work commitments with ABC Radio prevented him from participating and Livingston again filled his place as the group 's guitarist . 
 = = = Subsequent work = = = 
 Initially , McDermott was not interested in further pursuing comedy , which he came to regard as an " aberration " . However , in 1996 he returned to television after being recruited by Ted Robinson to host the satirical news @-@ based quiz show Good News Week . McDermott hosted the show until its cancellation in 2000 and returned to this role when the series was renewed in 2008 . He reunited with Robinson again in 2007 when he was named host of a new ABC variety program , The Sideshow , a show described as a successor to The Big Gig . Although it quickly built a strong cult audience , the show did not rate well and was cancelled after its initial run of 26 episodes . 
 In addition to his television work , McDermott has continued to be involved in live comedy . He has frequently participated in the Melbourne International Comedy Festival , having often captained one of the two competing teams in the festival 's Great Debate since his first debate appearance in 1994 . At the 2002 festival he not only presented a solo comedy show titled " <unk> " , but also performed with Cameron Bruce and Mick Moriarty in a music @-@ based comedy trio called GUD . McDermott described GUD as being in a similar vein to DAAS in that it revolved around music , comedy and the inter @-@ relationships between the band members onstage . 
 Ferguson also continued to pursue a career in television . In 1995 he hosted the Nine Network 's short @-@ lived game show Don 't Forget Your <unk> , and after the show 's cancellation Nine kept him on to develop new television pilots . However , the network was not sure how best to use his talents , and Ferguson left to pursue other work . During this time he wrote his first novel , Left , Right and Centre : A Tale Of Greed , Sex And Power , a political satire . His subsequent television credits have included Unreal TV , Big Brother , Funky Squad and Shock Jock , a 2001 cable sitcom which he also wrote and produced . He has also built a strong career as a corporate event performer and is a sessional lecturer at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology , where he teaches Narrative Comedy for the Professional Screenwriting Advanced Diploma and has run short courses on comedy writing since 2008 . In 2010 , he released a guide to comedy writing , The Cheeky Monkey : Writing Narrative Comedy . In 2010 , Ferguson hosted and co @-@ produced WTF – With Tim Ferguson , a comedy chat show on community television station <unk> Melbourne . 
 After leaving DAAS , Fidler became heavily involved in computers and multimedia . In 1996 he wrote the award @-@ winning CD @-@ ROM Real Wild Child , a history of Australian rock and roll . Fidler also wrote a regular monthly column for <unk> magazine on the digital media world , and contributed an essay to the Australian Constitutional Convention website [ 1 ] . Although he had not initially intended to return to television , he has hosted various TV shows since 1996 , including Race Around the World , Aftershock , <unk> Off and Vulture ; and spent three years in management as an editor of ABC TV comedy before deciding he " wasn 't cut out to be a manager " . In 2005 Fidler ventured into radio , fronting the 7 – 10pm shift on ABC Local Radio station 612 ABC Brisbane . Since 2006 , he has hosted the 11 am – 3pm shift on 612 ABC Brisbane , with the show 's first hour — known as The Conversation Hour — also broadcast on 702 ABC Sydney . He currently hosts Conversations with Richard Fidler [ 2 ] on ABC 's Radio National . In 2011 , Fidler co @-@ wrote a satirical book on Australian politics titled , Jack the Insider : The Insider 's Guide to Power in Australia , released by Random House Books , New Zealand [ 3 ] . 
 Original and founding member Robert Piper entered into a very successful career with the United Nations , serving in Cambodia , New York , Serbia , and other countries , and later worked for the Clinton Administration .

 " Castle Walls " is a song by American singers T.I. and Christina Aguilera , from T.I. ' s seventh studio album No Mercy ( 2010 ) . Alex da Kid produced the song and co @-@ wrote it along with Skylar Grey and T.I. The song was initially produced for Diddy 's album Last Train to Paris , but Diddy felt that " Castle Walls " would be better suited to T.I. ; Aguilera was later chosen as the featured artist on the song . A hip hop and electro number , " Castle Walls " received mixed response from music critics , some of whom picked it as a highlight from No Mercy , and some others criticized the song 's lyrics . Despite not being released as a single , the track still managed to appear on record charts of several nations , including on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles , where it peaked at number five . 
 = = Background = = 
 Originally , " Castle Walls " belonged to Diddy , who had commissioned the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money . But Diddy told T.I. , " Yeah , this is my record , but you know what , I think this is a better fit for you . I think you should rock out on this one . I think this speaks volumes to where you are , what you going through , what you living and how you feel . " Consequently , Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song , which appeared on T.I. ' s album No Mercy . Alex da Kid , producer of the song , said about the collaboration , " I love it . I think it 's amazing . It 's my sound , just kind of an evolution of that . I think it 'll cater to a lot of different people . " T.I. told RapFix Live about the track 's inspiration : 
 I live the life that most would die for , but there 's a lot of things that come with this life . People don 't take that into consideration . There are a lot of things in this life that I would trade in a minute just for a slice of normalcy [ ... ] I just listed a few things that they probably never viewed from that particular perspective . Because I think people need to see things another way ; they need to see it other than just celebrity . 
 In November 2010 , Alex da Kid announced that " Castle Walls " would be released as a single from No Mercy . However , the song was not released . A 30 @-@ second snippet of the song featuring Aguilera 's part was released onto YouTube later that month .

 " Castle Walls " lasts for a duration of 5 : 29 ( five minutes and twenty nine seconds ) and is a hip hop and electro song . The song features a Europop keyboard in its arrangement . Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club wrote that the lyrics of " Castle Walls " " offer similarly incisive and only occasionally self @-@ pitying commentary on the tragedy and triumph of being young , black , rich , famous , and a repeat felon . " The song begins with the chorus , in which Aguilera sings , " Everyone thinks that I have it all / But it 's so empty living behind these castle walls ( These castle walls ) / If I should tumble if I should fall / Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls ? / There 's no one here at all , behind these castle walls . " After the chorus , T.I. raps the verse " See with the Phantoms and Ferraris in the driveway / But you see it came in exchange of a sane man 's sanity / Your vision jaded by the Grammys on the mantlepiece / Just switch your camera lenses , you will see the agony " over a " warbling " electronic background and hip hop beats . Towards the song 's conclusion , there is a " sad " string arrangement and an electronica @-@ influenced " triumphantly striding beat . " An editor from HipHopDX compared " Castle Walls " to " Love the Way You Lie " by Eminem featuring Rihanna , which was also produced by da Kid . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Castle Walls " received mixed reviews from music critics . Becky Bain from Idolator called " Castle Walls " a " bright spot " for both T.I. and Aguilera " after the not @-@ so @-@ great years both artists have had . " Steve Jones , an editor from USA Today , praised Aguilera 's appearance on the track and picked it as one of the highlights on No Mercy . Likewise , Slava <unk> of HipHopDX and The Boston Globe 's Ken Capobianco labelled " Castle Walls " a standout from No Mercy and applauded Aguilera 's vocals . Chase McMullen from One Thirty BPM thought that the song " epitomizes the album nearly perfectly " , but opined that Justin Timberlake should be the guest vocalist rather than Aguilera . Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly simply deemed the track " mournful , lonely " and described the chorus on the song as " melancholy " . 
 David Amidon writing for PopMatters wrote a mixed review , calling " Castle Walls " " heartfelt [ ... ] but it also feels like a hip @-@ hop version of late @-@ period Phil Collins , a sort of end so inoffensive and far removed from the life force of hip @-@ hop as to appear a sick joke . " Critic Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone was displeased with the lyrics of the song , deeming it " an icky bit of self @-@ pity from a rich and famous man . " Sean Fennessey of The Washington Post named it an " unfortunately regal perspective " , while Pitchfork Media 's Tom Breihan called it " downright insulting . " Prefix Magazine 's Dave Park described " Castle Walls " as " cloying " and opined that the track bore an " embarrassing resemblance " to Britney Spears ' song " Lucky " ( 2001 ) . 
 Despite not being released as an official single , " Castle Walls " still managed to enter the record charts of several countries . The track was a success in South Korea , where it debuted at number six on the Gaon International Singles Chart during the week of 5 December 2010 .

 = Peter 's Progress = 
 " Peter 's Progress " is the 16th episode and the season finale of the seventh season of Family Guy . It originally aired on Fox in the United States on May 17 , 2009 . In the episode , a psychic reads Peter 's palms and discovers he led a fascinating past life as Griffin Peterson , a dignified gentleman in 17th @-@ century England , who was the original founder of Quahog . 
 The episode was written by Wellesley Wild and directed by Brian Iles . It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references . According to Nielsen ratings , it was viewed in 7 @.@ 33 million homes in its original airing . The episode featured guest performances by John Ross Bowie , Neil Patrick Harris , Brody Hutzler , <unk> Jordan , Keri Lynn Pratt , David Pressman , Josh Radnor , Martin Savage , Jason Segel , Alexander Siddig and Erik von Detten , along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series . This episode marks Cleveland Brown 's final regular appearance on Family Guy until the episode ' He 's <unk> @-@ ack ! ' in season 12 where he made his official return to the show . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Cleveland introduces his Jamaican cousin Madame Claude to Peter , Joe , and Quagmire saying she is a psychic . Cleveland offers to have her read their palms and determine past lives they have had . Madame Claude then determines that Joe was once an octopus whose tentacles were bitten off by a shark , and Quagmire was Jack the Ripper . When Claude reads Peter 's palm , she discovers that he was Griffin Peterson , the supposed founder of Quahog where the previously @-@ mentioned history of Quahog was a myth . Most of the episode follows the story of this past life , the main characters therein having the appearance of regular Family Guy characters . 
 In 17th @-@ century England , Griffin Peterson proposes to the love of his life Lady Redbush ( Lois ) upon getting the approval from Carter Redbush . The ruthless King Stewart III ( Stewie ) has the court jester ( Brian ) tell him some jokes after " deleting " How I Met Your Mother from his " TiVo " ( represented as archers killing Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , and Neil Patrick Harris ) . While being carried around in his litter , King Stewart spots Lady Redbush strolling through town with Griffin Peterson and decides that she should marry him instead . While Griffin Peterson is on the way to his wedding , Stewart secretly kidnaps him , exiling him to the New World on one of the outgoing ships . As Lady Redbush waits in growing angst , King Stewart walks into the church . He tells Lady Redbush that Griffin Peterson is dead and proceed to marry her himself . 
 At sea , Griffin Peterson meets fellow exiles Joe ( exiled for pleasuring himself in front of a carving ) , Quagmire ( exiled for having sex with an underage girl ) , and Seamus . Upon reaching the New World , Griffin Peterson establishes the colony of Quahog , which eventually grows into a thriving settlement . Griffin Peterson moves on with his life , even marrying another woman ( Meg ) . 
 Back in London , Later Redbush suffers a dull sexless marriage with King Stewart since they 're never available to each other . Lady Redbush continues to lament Griffin 's supposed death until the jester reveals the truth by showing her the newspaper about Quahog 's founding . The jester stated that he was to keep quiet about this under threat of execution . Lady Redbush and the jester immediately depart for Quahog on one of the slave ships . In Quahog , Griffin Peterson has grown irritated with his current wife until Lady Redbush arrives . Griffin Peterson and Lady <unk> are reunited and Griffin " divorces " his current wife by killing her with a musket . 
 Six months later , King Stewart learns that Redbush is gone and he makes his way to Quahog to reclaim his wife and kill Griffin Peterson . King Stewart 's army arrives in Quahog where they terrorize the colony ( similar to a scene from Blazing Saddles ) . King Stewart orders Cockney First Lieutenant ( Chris ) to search every house for them . Upon being discovered by the First Lieutenant , Griffin Peterson and Lady Redbush are confronted by King Stewart . Griffin Peterson threatens to kill the officer , while King Stewart threatens to kill Redbush . After exchanging threats without getting anywhere , Griffin and Stewart decide to settle their dispute with a talent show , with the winner winning Lady Redbush 's hand in marriage , and ownership of the town of Quahog . For his act , King Stewart steals his jester 's mostly unfunny jokes about his Aunt Frieda . However , Griffin , Quagmire , Joe , Cleveland , Mort , and Seamus effectively steal the show with a techno @-@ rock number from Revenge of the Nerds . This was enough to defeat King Stewart in the talent show . After King Stewart and his army leaves , Griffin and Redbush remain in Quahog to live happily ever after . 
 After the story is told , Peter , Quagmire , Cleveland , Joe , and Madame Claude see a promo @-@ ad for " Cross @-@ Armed Opposites "

 The episode was written by Wellesley Wild and directed by Brian Iles . The live action sequences used throughout the episode to promote supposed shows on Fox was directed by Bones director Steve Beers . The night the episode aired , the " Animation Domination " block was co @-@ hosted by an animated version of rapper Eminem and Stewie Griffin . Eminem , who provided his own voice , said that it was a " thrill to work with Stewie " and that he is a " big fan of talking babies and their humor " . 
 In addition to the main cast , Josh Radnor , Jason Segel and Neil Patrick Harris guest starred in the episode as their characters from the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother . Family Guy writer John Viener was the voice of Cleveland 's cousin , Madame Claude . Recurring guest voice actor John G. Brennan and writers Alec Sulkin , Danny Smith , Tom Devanney and Mark Hentemann made minor appearances in the episode . Alexander Siddig , Martin Savage , John Ross Bowie , Brody Hutzler , <unk> Jordan , Keri Lynn Pratt , David Pressman and Erik von Detten guest starred as well . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The title is a reference to The Pilgrim 's Progress . When Madame Claude tells everyone who they were in a past life , she reveals that Quagmire was Jack the Ripper . Also , when Madame Claude first speaks , Peter says that she sounds like Sebastian the crab from Disney 's The Little Mermaid King Stewart III orders to kill the cast of How I Met Your Mother after he is displeased with their performance . Griffin Peterson 's act in the talent show is a reference to the act the Lambda Lambda <unk> perform at the homecoming in the 1984 film Revenge of the Nerds . As a running gag throughout the episode , Fox promos appear on the bottom of the screen for made up shows including <unk> ' Buddies , Slowly Rotating Black Man , and Cross @-@ Armed Opposites , parodying stereotypical types of Fox mid @-@ show advertising . Griffin says that he is " the happiest guy in the world because he 's got a girl and is 290 years away from the films of Kevin Smith " . A clip is shown of Madonna celebrating her sixteenth birthday , suggesting she is over 300 years old . During King Stewart 's invasion of the settlement the music and lyrics are identical to that of Mel Brooks ' Blazing Saddles , with Rock Ridge changed to Quahog . A lady says of King Stewart , " I didn 't vote for him , " alluding to Monty Python and the Holy Grail . Harry <unk> from the film Bye Bye Birdie makes an appearance . Peter 's appearance is similar to Kajagoogoo frontman Limahl .

 In its original airing in the United States , " Peter 's Progress " was watched by 7 @.@ 33 million homes , which was up from the previous episode , and was the most watched show in the " Animation Domination " block , beating the season finales of The Simpsons , American Dad ! and King of the Hill . It acquired a 3 @.@ 7 rating in the 18 – 49 demographic , finishing third in its timeslot after the season finales of Survivor : Tocantins and Desperate Housewives . 
 The episode received mixed reviews from critics . Ahsan Haque of IGN said that " Family Guy has never really done anything particularly special for the last episode of any season [ ... ] and despite the obvious efforts to increase the animation quality and try to tell a complete story in this episode , it didn 't turn out to be the winning effort that will keep fans eagerly awaiting the show 's return next season " . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a D , and called it an " unfortunate and unfunny flashback [ ... ] with lots of incest gags [ that ] was genuinely queasy @-@ making , but not in a way that made anyone laugh from the shock of recognition or anything like that " , but said that Family Guy can be " damn funny when it wants to be " , referring to the Fox promos that take up the bottom quarter of the screen . Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a positive review , stating : " Good fun story , good fun jokes " , but said that the end " felt flat " because of the Revenge of the Nerds music sequence . 
 = New York State Route 446 = 
 New York State Route 446 ( NY 446 ) is a state highway in the Southern Tier of New York in the United States . The highway extends for 6 @.@ 76 miles ( 10 @.@ 88 km ) on a northeast – southwest alignment from an intersection with NY 16 north of the hamlet of Hinsdale to a junction with NY 305 in the village of Cuba . It parallels the Southern Tier Expressway ( NY 17 and Interstate 86 or I @-@ 86 ) very closely for its entire length . NY 446 was originally designated as part of Route 4 , an unsigned legislative route , in 1908 . The Hinsdale – Cuba highway received its first posted designation in 1924 when it was included as part of NY 17 . It was renumbered twice , becoming part of NY 63 in 1930 and NY 408 in the 1940s , before gaining its current designation c . 1975 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 446 begins at an intersection with NY 16 in the Hinsdale hamlet of <unk> , located a quarter @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 40 km ) north of exit 27 on the Southern Tier Expressway ( I @-@ 86 and NY 17 ) and roughly one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of the larger community of Hinsdale . The route heads northeast through the town of Hinsdale along the base of a valley surrounding Oil Creek . While NY 446 follows the north bank of the creek , the Southern Tier Expressway and the adjacent Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad ( WNYP ) run along the southern bank . 
 Near the Cattaraugus – Allegany county line , Route 446 , Oil Creek , and the WNYP all turn east toward Cuba ; however , the expressway continues on a northeasterly alignment to bypass the village to the north . Upon entering Allegany County , NY 446 passes under the Southern Tier Expressway and becomes known as Water Street as it enters Cuba from the west upon traversing Oil Creek . The route continues eastward for three blocks to NY 305 ( Genesee Street ) , where both Water Street and NY 446 terminate approximately a quarter @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 40 km ) south of exit 28 on the Southern Tier Expressway . 
 = = History = = 
 All of modern NY 446 was originally designated as part of Route 4 , a cross @-@ state unsigned legislative route defined by the New York State Legislature in 1908 . Route 4 continued south from Hinsdale on what is now NY 16 and east from the village of Cuba on County Route 20 . The legislative route system was replaced by the modern state route system in 1924 , at which time most of Route 4 was designated NY 17 , including from Hinsdale to Cuba . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , NY 17 was moved onto a more southerly alignment ( now NY 417 ) between Olean and Wellsville . Its former routing between Hinsdale and the Amity hamlet of Belvidere became the southwesternmost part of the new NY 63 , which continued north from Belvidere to the Lake Ontario shoreline . 
 NY 63 was rerouted south of Mount Morris in the early 1940s to follow its current alignment to Wayland . The former alignment of NY 63 from Hinsdale to Mount Morris was redesignated as NY 408 . In the early 1970s , construction began on the portion of the Southern Tier Expressway between Olean and Corning . From Hinsdale to Belvidere , the new highway closely followed NY 408 . By 1974 , the highway was open from Olean to Hinsdale and from Almond to Corning . The segment between Hinsdale and NY 19 in Belvidere was completed by January 1975 , and the leg between Belvidere and Almond opened to traffic on January 30 , 1975 , completing the Olean – Corning portion of the expressway . The bypassed section of NY 408 between Cuba and Belvidere was subsequently transferred to Allegany County , and NY 408 was truncated to its current southern terminus in Nunda as a result . The portion of NY 408 's former routing between Hinsdale and Cuba was retained as a state highway and renumbered to NY 446 .

 = Mesozoic mammals of Madagascar = 
 Several mammals are known from the Mesozoic of Madagascar . The Bathonian ( middle Jurassic ) Ambondro , known from a piece of jaw with three teeth , is the earliest known mammal with molars showing the modern , tribosphenic pattern that is characteristic of marsupial and placental mammals . Interpretations of its affinities have differed ; one proposal places it in a group known as Australosphenida with other Mesozoic tribosphenic mammals from the southern continents ( Gondwana ) as well as the monotremes , while others favor closer affinities with northern ( Laurasian ) tribosphenic mammals or specifically with placentals . At least five species are known from the Maastrichtian ( late Cretaceous ) , including a yet undescribed species known from a nearly complete skeleton that may represent a completely new group of mammals . The gondwanathere Lavanify , known from two teeth , is most closely related to other gondwanatheres found in India and Argentina . Two other teeth may represent another gondwanathere or a different kind of mammal . One molar fragment is one of the few known remains of a multituberculate mammal from Gondwana and another ( UA 8699 ) has been interpreted as either a marsupial or a placental . 
 = = Jurassic = = 
 Ambondro mahabo was described from the middle Jurassic ( Bathonian , about 167 million years ago ) of northwestern Madagascar in 1999 . It is known from a single lower jaw fragment with three teeth , probably the last premolar and first two molars . The molars have been interpreted as showing the tribosphenic pattern that is characteristic of modern mammals ; Ambondro is the oldest known mammal with such a pattern . This led its discoverers to propose that the ancestors of tribosphenic mammals arose in the south ( Gondwana ) , not , as generally assumed , in the north ( Laurasia ) . In 2001 , however , paleontologist Zhe @-@ Xi Luo and colleagues alternatively proposed that Ambondro was part of a clade with Ausktribosphenos from the Cretaceous of Australia and the monotremes that developed <unk> independently from other mammals ( Boreosphenida ) . This clade , Australosphenida , has since been expanded with more recently discovered species from Argentina ( Asfaltomylos and Henosferus ) and Australia ( Bishops ) . Other paleontologists have disagreed with this interpretation and proposed different models ; for example , in 2001 Denise <unk> @-@ Russell and colleagues proposed that although Ausktribosphenos and monotremes were related , Ambondro was not and was in fact more similar to boreosphenidans , and in 2003 Michael Woodburne and colleagues excluded monotremes from Australosphenida and placed the remaining australosphenidans close to placentals . The deposits that produced Ambondro have yielded some reptiles , but no other mammals . 
 = = Cretaceous = = 
 The Mahajanga Basin of northwestern Madagascar has produced a rich late Cretaceous fauna , including various dinosaurs and crocodyliforms as well as mammals , found by the team of David W. Krause since 1993 . Many of these taxa show affinities with similarly aged South American and Indian animals , also parts of Gondwana . The mammalian fauna consists of several taxa known only by isolated teeth and a single reasonably complete skeleton , none of which can be plausibly related to the Recent Madagascar fauna ( see list of mammals of Madagascar ) . The fossils come from the Maastrichtian ( latest Cretaceous ) of the <unk> Member of the Maevarano Formation . 
 Two teeth , one complete and one damaged , form the known material of the gondwanathere Lavanify , first described in 1997 . The teeth are high @-@ crowned and curved ; one contains a deep cementum @-@ filled furrow and the other at least one deep pit ( infundibulum ) . Lavanify appears to be most closely related to the Indian gondwanathere Bharattherium and more distantly to the other gondwanatheres , which are known from Argentina . Two other teeth , not yet fully described , may represent different tooth positions of another gondwanathere . One , a fragmentary molariform ( molar or molar @-@ like premolar — the identities of gondwanathere tooth are poorly understood ) is larger and lower @-@ crowned than the Lavanify teeth and the other , which is complete and unworn , is yet lower @-@ crowned and has the surface obliquely oriented . Its crown consists of a W @-@ shaped ridge with the parts separated by deep infundibula . This second tooth may also represent a completely different , yet unknown mammalian group . 
 A fragmentary molar , preserving two cusps , is identified as from a multituberculate . Although multituberculates are common in nearly contemporaneous deposits in Laurasia , this tooth is one of the few records from Gondwana ; a few fragmentary remains , the multituberculate affinities of some of which are disputed , are also known from South America ( Argentodites ) , Africa ( <unk> ) , and Australia ( <unk> ) . Another fragmentary tooth , UA 8699 , is recognizable as a tribosphenic lower molar . Krause identified it in 2001 as a marsupial , but in 2003 a group led by Alexander Averianov instead argued that the tooth was placental and related to zhelestids ( a primitive group possibly related to ungulates ) . Both placentals and marsupials are mostly known from Laurasia during the Cretaceous . 
 In addition to these fragmentary teeth , the Maevarano Formation has also yielded a nearly complete , articulated skeleton of an immature , cat @-@ sized mammal that has not yet been fully described . It is the most complete mammal known from the Mesozoic of Gondwana . Its skull is damaged , but its unusual dentition is preserved . The incisors ( two on each side of the upper and one on each side of the lower jaw ) project forwards and are separated from the three or four cheektooth in each side of the lower and upper jaws by a large diastema ( gap ) . It shows primitive features , such as the presence of <unk> bones ( in the pelvis ) , a <unk> ( a small bone placed between the premaxilla and the maxilla in the upper jaw ) , and a deep zygomatic arch ( cheekbone ) . On the other hand , it has derived traits like the presence of a well @-@ developed trochlea on the distal ( far ) end of the humerus ( upper arm bone ) , the absence of a rim at the dorsal ( upper ) margin of the acetabulum ( the opening in the pelvis which receives the head of the femur ) , a small lesser trochanter of the femur ( upper leg bone ) , reduced contact between the fibula ( the smaller of the two lower leg bones ) and the calcaneum ( heel bone ) , and the dentition . In a 2000 abstract , Krause identified it as a therian ( a member of the group that includes marsupials , placentals , and their closest extinct relatives ) more derived than the early Cretaceous <unk> of Argentina , but in 2006 he and colleagues instead refused to place it in any existing higher @-@ order mammalian group and claimed that " it represents a major new <unk> clade " . 
 = Suillus spraguei = 
 Suillus spraguei is a species of fungus in the Suillaceae family . It is known by a variety of common names , including the painted slipperycap , the painted suillus or the red and yellow suillus . Suillus spraguei has had a complex taxonomical history , and is also frequently referred to Suillus pictus in the literature . The readily identifiable fruit bodies have caps that are dark red when fresh , dry to the touch , and covered with mats of hairs and scales that are separated by yellow cracks . On the underside of the cap are small , yellow , angular pores that become brownish as the mushroom ages . The stalk bears a grayish cottony ring , and is typically covered with soft hairs or scales . 
 Suillus spraguei grows in a mycorrhizal association with several pine species , particularly eastern white pine , and the fruit bodies grow on the ground , appearing from early summer to autumn . It has a disjunct distribution , and is found in eastern Asia , northeastern North America , and Mexico throughout the range of the host tree . The mushroom is edible , although opinions about its quality vary . The mushroom bears a resemblance to several other Suillus species , including the closely related S. decipiens , although the species can be differentiated by variations in color and size . 
 = = Taxonomy , phylogeny , and naming = = 
 Suillus spraguei has had a complex taxonomic history . Although the first specimen was originally collected in New England in 1856 by Charles James Sprague , a formal scientific description was not published until 1872 when Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis called it Boletus spraguei . In a publication that appeared the following year , American mycologist Charles Horton Peck named the species Boletus pictus . Berkeley and Curtis had also described what they believed to be a new species — Boletus <unk> — although this was later considered by Rolf Singer to be merely a younger version of their Boletus spraguei . Although Peck 's description appeared in print in 1873 , the date stamp on the original publication revealed that he had sent his documents to the printer before the appearance of the 1872 Berkeley and Curtis publication , thus establishing nomenclatural priority under the rules of fungal naming . However , in 1945 Singer reported that the name Boletus pictus was illegitimate because it was a homonym , already being used for a polypore mushroom described by Carl Friedrich Schultz in 1806 . The name was officially switched to Suillus spraguei in 1986 ( Otto Kuntze had previously transferred the taxon to Suillus in 1898 ) . 
 A 1996 molecular analysis of 38 Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus . The results indicate that S. spraguei is most closely related to S. decipiens . The species S. granulatus and S. placidus lie on a branch sister to that containing S. spraguei . These results were corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various Suillus , including S. spraguei . The analysis supported the hypothesis that Chinese and U.S. S. spraguei and S. decipiens were each other 's closest relatives , and the clade that contained them could be divided into four distinct subgroups : S. decipiens , U.S. S. spraguei , China ( Yunnan ) S. spraguei , and China ( Jilin ) S. spraguei . 
 The specific epithet spraguei is an homage to the collector Sprague , while pictus means " painted " or " colored " . Suillus spraguei is commonly known as the " painted slipperycap " , the " painted suillus " , or the " red and yellow suillus " . It is also called the " eastern painted Suillus " to contrast with the " western painted Suillus " ( Suillus lakei ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of the fruit body is 3 to 12 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 4 @.@ 7 in ) in diameter , and depending on its age , is either conic to convex , to somewhat flattened at maturity . The cap margin is initially rolled downward before straightening out , often with hanging remnants of partial veil ( appendiculate ) . The cap surface is covered with densely matted filaments that are rough and scale @-@ like . The scales are pink to brownish red , fading to a pale brown @-@ gray or dull yellow in maturity . Under the scales , the cap surface is yellow to pale yellow @-@ orange . While many other Suillus species have a sticky or slimy cap , S. spraguei is dry . The flesh is yellow . 
 The pores on the underside of the cap are yellowish and angular , measuring 0 @.@ 5 to 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 02 to 0 @.@ 20 in ) wide , and formed by tubes that extend 4 to 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 3 in ) deep . These pores have a slightly decurrent attachment to the stem ( extending down its length ) . Young specimens have a whitish fibrous partial veil that protects the developing pores ; as the cap expands it rips the veil , which remains as a grayish ring on the stem . The stem is 4 to 12 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 4 @.@ 7 in ) long , and 1 to 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 0 in ) thick , roughly cylindrical in shape , or sometimes with a bulbous bottom so as to be somewhat club @-@ shaped . The stem surface is tomentose , with scales at the top , and a ring on the upper half of the stem . Below the ring the stem is fibrillose , covered with a mat of soft hairs . Its color at the top is yellow , but with wine @-@ red to reddish @-@ brown scales below , underlaid with a pale yellow to grayish color . The stem is usually solid , rarely hollow . The tissue of all parts of the fruit body — cap , pores , and stem — will turn brownish shortly after being bruised or injured . 
 In deposit , such as with a spore print , the spores of S. spraguei appear olive @-@ brown in color , although this changes to clay or tawny @-@ olive after drying . Microscopically , the spores have smooth surfaces , measuring 9 – 11 by 3 – 4 @.@ 5 µm ; in side profile they have asymmetrical sides and a suprahilar depression ( a surface indentation formed where the spore attaches to the basidia ) , while in face view they appear oblong . The spores are not amyloid , meaning that they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer 's reagent . The basidia ( the spore @-@ bearing cells in the hymenium ) are thin @-@ walled , four @-@ spored , and have dimensions of 17 – 19 by 5 – 7 @.@ 8 µm . In the presence of potassium hydroxide , they appear hyaline ( translucent ) , and they become pale yellow to nearly hyaline in Melzer 's reagent . 
 Various parts of the mushroom display characteristic color reactions to chemical tests commonly used in mushroom identification . The cap cuticle will turn a blackish color with the application of a drop of potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) , iron sulfate ( FeSO4 ) solution , or ammonia solution . The mushroom flesh turns grayish @-@ green to greenish black with a drop of FeSO4 , and olive to greenish black with KOH or NH4OH . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Suillus spraguei is an edible mushroom . Its taste is not distinctive , although the odor has been described as " slightly fruity " . Although it turns a blackish color when cooked , some consider it choice , and " among the better edibles in the genus Suillus . " In contrast , another source on mushrooms of Québec described the mushroom as a poor edible ( " <unk> <unk> " ) , and warned of a slightly acidic taste and disagreeable flavor . Michael Kuo 's 2007 book 100 Edible Mushrooms rates the taste as mediocre , suggesting " its <unk> consistency has all the palatability of <unk> gelatin . " The book recommends frying the thinly sliced mushroom in butter or oil until it acquires a crispy texture . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 S. spraguei is a popular edible among novice mushroom hunters as it is readily identifiable due to both its appearance and its association with White Pine . Although this distinctiveness renders it unlikely to be confused with other species , it does share similar characteristics with several other Suillus species . S. spraguei bears some resemblance to the rosy larch bolete ( S. <unk> ) , but the latter species has a darker spore print , a thicker stem , and grows in association with larch . S. <unk> , another associate of larch trees , is more brownish and has a hollow stalk . S. lakei is less brightly colored than S. spraguei , has a shorter stalk , and usually grows with Douglas fir . S. decipiens has a less intensely red cap when young , but the color of older specimens fade and can resemble S. spraguei . S. decipiens generally has a smaller stature , with a cap ranging from 4 to 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter , and stem that is typically 4 – 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) long by 0 @.@ 7 – 1 @.@ 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 6 in ) thick . Further , its pores are irregular in shape , measuring 0 @.@ 5 – 1 mm in diameter at maturity , and stain a shade of hazel rather than reddish to brownish . It is found in the southeastern United States , from New Jersey south to Florida and west to Texas . 
 = = Ecology , habitat and distribution = = 
 In nature , Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with five @-@ needled pine species . This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the trees , enabling the fungus to receive moisture , protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree , and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients . S. spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae ( covered with wart @-@ like projections ) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind , and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath . The fungus has ecological host specificity , and in natural soils can only associate with white pine , a grouping of trees classified in subgenus <unk> of the genus Pinus . However , under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory , S. spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine , Pitch Pine , and <unk> Pine . Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine , Chinese White Pine , Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White Pine . In North America , fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes , as early as June ( bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July – September ) , although they may be found as late as October . Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces <unk> . In the asexual stage of H. <unk> , it appears initially as patches of whitish mold on the surface of the cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia ( asexual spores ) . In the sexual stage , the mold changes color , progressing from yellow @-@ brown to brown , greenish @-@ brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia , asci @-@ containing sexual structures that produce ascospores . The perithecia are <unk> and give the surface a roughened texture . 
 A Japanese field study found that S. spraguei was the dominant fungus in a 21 @-@ year @-@ old stand of Korean Pine , both in terms of ectomycorrhizae ( measured as percentage of biomass present in soil samples ) and by fruit body production ( comprising over 90 % of dry weight of total fruit bodies collected of all species ) . The production of S. spraguei fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter , without much variance during the four @-@ year study period . The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November , tended to grow in clumps , and the spatial distribution of clumps was random — the location of the clumps was not <unk> with appearances in previous years . The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average , suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat . The results also suggested that S. spraguei prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low litter accumulation , a finding corroborated in a later publication . This study also determined that the fungus propagates mainly by vegetative growth ( extension of underground mycelia ) , rather than by colonization of spores . 
 Suillus spraguei has a disjunct distribution and is known from several localities in Asia , including China , Japan , Korea , and Taiwan . In North America , its range extends from eastern Canada ( Nova Scotia ) south to the Carolinas , and west to Minnesota . It has also been collected in Mexico ( Coahuila and Durango ) . Furthermore , the species has been introduced to Europe ( Germany , Lower Saxony ; Netherlands ) .

 Maryland Route 404 ( MD 404 ) is a major highway on Maryland 's Eastern Shore in the United States . It runs 24 @.@ 61 miles ( 39 @.@ 61 km ) from MD 662 in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne 's and Talbot counties , southeast to the Delaware state line in Caroline County , where the road continues as Delaware Route 404 ( DE 404 ) to Nassau ( near Rehoboth Beach ) . The Maryland and Delaware state highways together cross the width of the Delmarva Peninsula and serve to connect the cities west of the Chesapeake Bay by way of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and U.S. Route 50 ( US 50 ) with the Delaware Beaches . Along the way , MD 404 passes through mostly farmland and woodland as well as the towns of Queen Anne , Hillsboro , and Denton . The road is a two @-@ lane undivided highway for most of its length with the exception of the bypass around Denton and a section near Hillsboro , which is a four @-@ lane divided highway . 
 MD 404 was designated by 1933 to run from Matapeake ( where the Annapolis @-@ Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis ) , east along present @-@ day MD 8 , US 50 , and MD 662 to Wye Mills , where it followed its current routing to the Delaware border . By 1946 , the route ’ s western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis , where it headed east across the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point @-@ Matapeake ferry . The western terminus was cut back to Wye Mills in 1949 , having been replaced with US 50 west of there . The route was realigned to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro in 1960 and Denton in 1987 . 
 Since MD 404 is the main route for travelers between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches , the road has a high accident rate . To improve on this situation , the Maryland State Highway Administration is planning to widen the two @-@ lane portions of the route into a four @-@ lane divided highway . A portion of the road east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County received $ 7 @.@ 7 million for widening as a part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009 .

 MD 404 begins at an intersection with MD 662 ( Old Wye Mills Road ) in Wye Mills on the border of Queen Anne 's and Talbot Counties , heading to the east on Queen Anne 's Highway , a two @-@ lane undivided road . It heads east through farmland along the Queen Anne 's / Talbot County border before reaching an intersection with US 50 ( Ocean Gateway ) . Upon crossing US 50 , MD 404 becomes a part of the main route between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Delaware Beaches . MD 404 continues east through farmland with some residences and wooded areas as a two @-@ lane road , approaching the town of Queen Anne . 
 Further east , Old Queen Anne Road splits from MD 404 , with MD 404 crossing entirely into Queen Anne 's County . It resumes east through some farmland before coming to an intersection with MD 309 ( Starr Road ) . Past MD 309 , the route intersects the northern terminus of MD 303 ( Main Street ) , which intersects the route as a northbound @-@ only road that provides access to eastbound MD 404 . From MD 303 , the road heads into wooded areas adjacent to Tuckahoe State Park before crossing the Tuckahoe Creek . 
 MD 404 enters Caroline County upon crossing the Tuckahoe Creek , where it becomes Shore Highway . It widens into a four @-@ lane divided highway and emerges from the woods into agricultural areas , intersecting MD 480 ( Ridgely Road ) near Hillsboro . Past that intersection , the route heads through a mix of woods and residences , narrowing back into a two @-@ lane undivided road , before intersecting MD 404 Alt . ( Hillsboro Road ) , where MD 404 heads into a mix of farms and woodland . Unsigned MD 485 ( Saathoff Road ) loops to the south of MD 404 , returning to the route before the intersection with the southern terminus of MD 312 ( Downes Station Road ) . The route continues to the southeast through farms , heading toward Denton . As the road approaches Denton , it widens into a four @-@ lane divided highway that heads through rural areas with some residences and businesses . MD 404 Bus . ( Meeting House Road ) splits from MD 404 to head through the center of Denton while MD 404 continues east to bypass Denton to the north . 
 The route continues east through fields before intersecting MD 328 ( New Bridge Road ) . Past this intersection , MD 404 crosses over the Choptank River . It continues east as a limited @-@ access road with a diamond interchange with MD 313 ( Greensboro Road ) and unsigned MD 619 ( Sixth Street ) , where some businesses are located . MD 313 forms a concurrency with MD 404 and the two routes turn south , heading along the eastern side of Denton through woodland and then past residential neighborhoods . It turns to the southwest , heading into woods and intersecting MD 404 Bus . ( Franklin Street / Gay Street ) at an at @-@ grade intersection . MD 313 and MD 404 continue as a surface road that turns south and heads through some commercial areas . 
 The road heads south into farmland , passing by <unk> State Park . It crosses over Watts Creek and comes to an intersection with MD 16 ( Harmony Road ) , with that route joining MD 313 and MD 404 for a three @-@ way concurrency . The three routes continue southeast , narrowing into a two @-@ lane undivided road that heads through a mix of woods and farms with some homes . The road turns more to the east @-@ southeast , with MD 313 splitting from MD 16 and MD 404 by heading south on Federalsburg Highway in Andersontown . The road turns southeast and in a short distance , MD 16 splits from MD 404 by heading east on Greenwood Road . Past this intersection , MD 404 continues southeast through farmland and woodland to the Delaware border , where the road continues as DE 404 , which runs east to an intersection with DE 1 in Five Points ( near Rehoboth Beach ) . 
 MD 404 is a part of the main National Highway System for its entire length except for the portion from MD 662 to US 50 in Wye Mills . 
 = = History = = 
 By 1921 , what would become MD 404 was built as a state highway within Queen Anne , from Hillsboro to a point between Hillsboro and Denton , and between West Denton and Denton . The state highway between Queen Anne and Denton was completed by 1927 . By 1933 , MD 404 was designated onto a state highway between Matapeake , where the Annapolis @-@ Matapeake ferry across the Chesapeake Bay connected the route to Annapolis in Anne Arundel County , and the Delaware border southeast of Denton . The route headed east across Kent Island to Queenstown , where it turned southeast to Wye Mills and continued east through Queen Anne , Hillsboro , and Denton . By 1946 , the route 's western terminus was moved to MD 2 north of Annapolis in Anne Arundel County , crossing the Chesapeake Bay on the Sandy Point @-@ Matapeake ferry , roughly where the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is now , and continuing west through Skidmore to MD 2 . MD 404 was rerouted to bypass Wye Mills in 1948 , with part of the former alignment through the community becoming part of MD 662 . 
 A year later , the western terminus of MD 404 was moved to MD 662 in Wye Mills . West of Wye Mills , the route was replaced by an extended US 50 . The former alignment of MD 404 west of Wye Mills is now the US 50 approaches to the Chesapeake Bay Bridge , with the part between Matapeake and Stevensville now a part of MD 8 . In 1950 , MD 404 was rerouted to bypass Queen Anne and Hillsboro to the north , with the former alignment now MD 404 Alt . A portion of the route between Hillsboro and Denton was bypassed in 1960 . This former alignment of MD 404 is now known as Saathoff Road and has the unsigned MD 485 designation . In 1972 , MD 404 and MD 313 were relocated to a one @-@ way pair , eastbound Franklin Street and westbound Gay Street , through Denton . The routes previously headed south out of Denton on Sixth Street and Fifth Avenue . The former alignment along Sixth Street became MD 619 by 1978 . In the early 1980s , construction began to widen MD 404 to a divided highway . By 1985 , construction was underway for the four @-@ lane divided bypass of Denton between MD 404 west of Denton and MD 313 north of Denton . In 1987 , MD 313 and MD 404 were rerouted to bypass Denton along the newly completed four @-@ lane divided bypass . The former alignment of MD 404 through Denton became MD 404 Bus . The divided highway portion of MD 404 in the Denton area was extended further in the 2000s from the south end of Denton to the Sennett Road intersection east of where MD 16 joins the route . This project received $ 3 million from the federal government in 2001 . 
 On May 29 , 2011 , the Route 404 Memorial Garden , located near Denton , was dedicated , honoring those who were killed in car accidents along MD 404 . The memorial consists of a flagpole surrounded by a circular path with bricks bearing the names of people who died along the route . 
 = = Future = = 
 The Maryland State Highway Administration is working on improvements to MD 404 in order to provide relief to travelers driving to the ocean resorts , notably by widening the remainder of the route into a four @-@ lane divided highway . The primary motive behind the widening is the high accident rate that plagues the two @-@ lane road , brought on by beach traffic . As part of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17 , 2009 , $ 7 @.@ 7 million went to widening a portion of MD 404 east of Tuckahoe Creek in Caroline County , creating 221 jobs . On May 21 , 2014 , groundbreaking took place to widen MD 404 between west of MD 309 and Cemetery Road . The project to widen this section of will cost a total of $ 39 million . On June 25 , 2015 , Governor Larry Hogan announced that state funding would be allocated to finish widening MD 404 between US 50 and Denton , among other projects across the state . A total of $ 160 million in funds would go to widening MD 404 .

 Maryland Route 404 Alternate ( MD 404 Alt . ) is a 2 @.@ 69 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 33 km ) long alternate route of MD 404 in Talbot and Caroline counties . The route runs along the former alignment of MD 404 through the towns of Queen Anne and Hillsboro . The route begins at an intersection with MD 309 ( Cordova Road ) near Queen Anne , Talbot County , where it heads east on two @-@ lane undivided Millsboro Denton Road . West of MD 309 , Old Queen Anne Road continues west to MD 404 . MD 404 Alt. passes through woodland , crossing under the abandoned Chesapeake Railroad before coming to MD 303 ( Lewistown Road ) . At this point , the route turns north to form a concurrency with MD 303 along Talbot Avenue , and the two routes enter Queen Anne as it turns to the east . MD 303 splits from MD 404 Alternate by turning north on Main Street , while MD 404 Alt. continues east past homes , intersecting MD 518 ( First Street ) . As the road runs a short distance to the south of the Tuckahoe Creek , there is an industrial building on the south side of the road . Upon crossing the Tuckahoe Creek , MD 404 Alt. enters Hillsboro in Caroline County and becomes Hillsboro Road . The route continues through residential areas of the town . Upon leaving Hillsboro , the road heads into agricultural areas with a few homes and a patch of woods . MD 404 Alt. ends at an intersection with MD 404 east of Hillsboro .

 " Outta My Head " is a song recorded by British singer @-@ songwriter Leona Lewis for her second studio album Echo ( 2009 ) . The track was written by Savan Kotecha , Max Martin and Johan " Shellback " Schuster , and produced by the latter two . It is an electropop and Eurodance song , and its compositional structure is noticeably different from the other songs on Echo . The instrumentation consists of keyboard riffs and beats , instead of pianos and guitars which are used on the other songs . The chorus of " Outta My Head " was compared to the works of Australian singer Kylie Minogue and German singer Cascada due to its Eurodance style . It debuted and peaked at number 98 on the Slovakian Singles Chart upon the release of Echo . Lewis has performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live ! and it was included on the set list of her debut concert tour , The Labyrinth ( 2010 ) .

 " Outta My Head " was written by Savan Kotecha , Max Martin and Shellback , with production done by the latter two , for Lewis 's second studio album , Echo ( 2009 ) . It was recorded by Ann <unk> in Maratone Studios , Stockholm , Sweden and at Germano Studios , New York . She was assisted in the process by Christian Baker . It was mixed by Serban <unk> at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach , VA . The Pro Tools engineer for the mixing was John Hanes , and his assistant was Tim Roberts . " Outta My Head " is an electropop and Eurodance song which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 39 seconds ; it appears as the fifth song on the standard United Kingdom track list of Echo . On the US edition , it runs for one second less and is included as the sixth track . The instrumentation of " Outta My Head " is different from the rest of the songs on Echo and does not follow the same styles of production . Instead of using pianos and guitars , it employs " stuttering keyboard riffs " and " cheap beats " . The lyrics of the song contain a " F * * k you ! " sentiment . 
 " Outta My Head " moves at a tempo of 130 beats per minute in the key of C major . Lewis ' vocals span from G3 to A5 . The song follows a chord progression of F – C – Em .

 " Outta My Head " garnered mixed reviews from music critics . Nick Levine for Digital Spy described " Outta My Head " as a " genuine surprise " because of its uptempo style and how different it is to the rest of the songs on Echo , which Levine thought often sounded the same from song to song . He further wrote that the chorus is something which would suit German Eurodance singer Cascada . Writing for The Independent , Andy Gill praised the song for its " fast , juddering " style and wrote that it is the edgiest song on the album . Although , he thought that it did not deviate from " the chunky , machine @-@ like reliability " which is present on the rest of Echo . Michael Cragg for musicOMH complimented the song for lifting Echo 's overall feel of being " mundane " , and that it is an " obvious highlight " of the album . He continued to write that the chorus is " brilliantly camp " and would be well suited to Kylie Minogue . Nate Chinen for The New York Times thought that Lewis was trying to show musical relevance with songs such as " Outta My Head " and " Love Letter " , but achieves it with mixed results . " But Ms. Lewis strives for relevance here too , with mixed results . " Love Letter " is Kelly Clarkson without the spunk ; " Outta My Head " is Lady Gaga without the smirk . " 
 Mike Diver for BBC Music thought that the song represents " cheesy " Eurodance and almost achieves being a credible dance song , if it was not for the slightly " too cheap @-@ sounding , too tinny of production " . As part of his review of Echo , Matthew Cole for Slant Magazine wrote that he was unimpressed by the " novelty " of Lewis ' impressive vocals , writing that she uses the higher registers of her voice too much . " The fact that Lewis can sing isn 't a novelty here — it 's the premise of the album . On nearly every track she can be found cooing impossibly high melodies over bouncing club beats ( ' Can 't Breathe , ' ' Outta My Head ' ) or imbuing the ballads with thick , powerful choruses to match their outsized string arrangements ( ' Broken ' ) . Hugh Montgomery , writing for The Guardian , was critical of the song , writing that it is the " only serious misfire " on the album and that it confirms how " Lewis does sexy and upbeat like Jedward do singing in tune . " Although he thought Lewis ' vocals are " technically unimpeachable " on " Outta My Head " , it is the artistry behind it which fails to deliver .

 = The True Cost = 
 The True Cost is a 2015 documentary film directed by Andrew Morgan that focuses on fast fashion . It discusses several aspects of the garment industry from production — mainly exploring the life of low @-@ wage workers in developing countries — to its after @-@ effects such as river and soil pollution , pesticide contamination , disease and death . Using an approach that looks at environmental , social and psychological aspects , it also examines consumerism and mass media , ultimately linking them to global capitalism . The documentary is a collage of several interviews with environmentalists , garment workers , factory owners , and people organizing fair trade companies or promoting sustainable clothing production . 
 Morgan 's attention was drawn to the topic after the 2013 Savar building collapse , when a commercial building in Bangladesh named Rana Plaza toppled and killed over a thousand workers . Starting the project in October of that year , he traveled to thirteen countries to collect information and conduct interviews . The film was funded by Kickstarter and premiered at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival in early May 2015 before its release in select American and British theaters later that month . Critics have been both positive and dismissive , with reviews ranging from " vitally important documentary " to " vague liberal agitprop " . 
 = = Content = = 
 In The True Cost , Morgan examines the garment industry — specifically the fast fashion business — and links it to consumerism , globalization , capitalism , structural poverty , and oppression . In the film , it is stated that in the 1960s , the American fashion industry produced 95 % of the clothes its people wore , while now only 3 % percent are produced in the United States , with the rest produced in developing countries . Operating in countries such as Bangladesh , India , Cambodia , and China , major brand manufacturers minimize costs and maximize profits by having companies in those countries competing against each other . The international brands pressure the factory owners , threatening to close and move production to another country if the clothes are not cheap enough ; the owners in turn pressure their workers and , as one owner says , " They 're hampering me , I 'm hampering my workers " . 
 According to Morgan , despite garment manufacturing being a three @-@ trillion @-@ dollar industry , the working conditions in those countries are poor . In addition to having to work in those conditions and live on low salaries , these workers have a difficult time demanding their rights ; Bangladeshi workers in Dhaka may be beaten by their employers while Cambodians are shot by police . In Dhaka , workers must work in hot and chemical @-@ ridden environments and structurally unsound buildings . The film shows the events of the 2013 Savar building collapse when an eight @-@ story commercial building named Rana Plaza collapsed . Just prior to that , workers had been forced into the factory even though a crack was seen in the walls . 
 The film shows how the demand for cotton in India has led to the planting of genetically modified ( GM ) cotton , and how the monopoly inherent in its use by seed companies causes an increase in the price of cotton , leading to suicides among farmers who lose their land to these companies because they cannot pay the higher seed prices . GM crops need more pesticides , causing environmental damage , birth defects leading to mental and physical disabilities among the Punjab people , and an increased rate of cancer . The film claims that sometimes the companies that produce the pesticides are the same ones that produce the needed medications . A similar scenario occurs in contaminated cotton fields in Texas , where pesticides are causing brain tumors . The garment industry is the second @-@ most @-@ polluting industry the world , according to the film , which is illustrated by leather tanneries pouring chromium into the Ganges River in Kanpur , India . 
 In the film , the focus returns to America , where it looks at how media affects the desire of people — especially teenagers — to buy and create an identity focused on consumption . This is borne out by a 500 % worldwide increase in clothing consumption compared to the 1990s . However , clothes are quickly disposed of ; an average American wastes 82 lb ( 37 kg ) of textiles a year . Only 10 % percent of donated clothes go to thrift shops ; the rest go to landfills , such as those in Port @-@ au @-@ Prince , Haiti . Aside from weakening local industries by this constant disposal of clothes , land and water are polluted because most apparel is made from non @-@ biodegradable materials . 
 Throughout the film , Morgan shows people who defend the low @-@ cost prices such as Benjamin Powell of the Free Market Institute at Texas Tech University and Kate Ball @-@ Young , former sourcing manager of Joe Fresh . Ball @-@ Young says that , in comparison to more precarious alternative work , the fashion industry is a good choice for workers . Powell argues sweatshops are " part of the very process that raises living standards and leads to better working conditions over time " . In contrast , the film shows a Texas organic cotton farmer , eco fashion activist Livia Firth and her sustainability @-@ focused consulting firm , and people who manage fair trade clothing companies , such as animal @-@ rights activist Stella McCartney , People Tree 's Safia <unk> , Redress 's Christina Dean , and Patagonia 's Vincent Stanley . 
 Other individuals interviewed and appearing in the film include : television personalities Stephen Colbert and John Oliver , economist Richard D. Wolff , John Hilary of the charity War on Want , professor of media studies Mark Crispin Miller , psychologist Tim <unk> , physician <unk> Singh , and environmentalists Rick Ridgeway and Vandana Shiva . 
 = = Production = = 
 The documentary 's budget of US $ 500 @,@ 000 was obtained through individual investors and Kickstarter , with Kickstarter crowd funders contributing US $ 76 @,@ 546 . Morgan refused to accept money from companies , non @-@ governmental organizations , and foundations to keep the project " autonomous " . During a two @-@ year period beginning in October 2013 , Morgan traveled to twenty @-@ five cities in thirteen countries , where he collected information and conducted interviews . Some of the interviews were made possible through the efforts of executive producer Livia Firth , who introduced Morgan to eco fashion . Morgan had planned to interview Firth , but when she learned about the project she became interested in it and recommended people for him to talk to . Firth became heavily involved with the project , and after completing several interviews with her , Morgan showed Firth the final cut and made her an executive producer for the film . He had also planned to conduct interviews with 25 " major " brands , but none of them agreed to appear in the film . 
 With no knowledge of the fashion industry , Morgan decided to make a film on the topic after being shocked by the news of the collapse of Rana Plaza . After spending several days getting information , and discovering the industry 's human rights violations and " staggering environmental impacts " , he was sure he had to make the film . He had also previously had an appreciation for the genre , saying he was " actually fascinated by those [ fashion ] films that follow one person " . Like Morgan a non @-@ connoisseur of fashion , executive producer and eco activist Lucy <unk> said that she does not like such films as they are usually limited to exploring the aesthetic aspects of the industry . It is The True Cost differential in her opinion ; it " goes there and then some ‍ — ‌ it unravels the grim , gritty , global supply chain of fast fashion " . Nevertheless , the film purposely does not give viewers a clear answer on how to solve the problems as there are " no straightforward answers " . Morgan commented , " I 'm probably most proud that we avoided easy answers and instead chose to trust people to both feel and think deeply about the issues raised . " 
 Regarding the ultimate objectives behind the making of the film , Morgan said he was not trying to blame just a single company nor the fast fashion industry as " it did not invent a very irresponsible way of manufacturing , it did not invent <unk> the consumption of things . " The director said the film was intended to be a caution on the " incessant consumption of mediocre stuff " and an incentive to view shopping as something more than a hobby , adding that buying is " a moral act and there is a chain reaction of consequences " . He commented he was not trying to be " anti @-@ business or anti @-@ market " but was just reaffirming basic human rights and showing the limits of natural resources . 
 Morgan said his main hope for the film was that it would spark a debate on the topic and make people " more mindful and choose things that support life and not take it away . " Morgan thought he had included a good number of counter @-@ examples of how people can make a difference , so the film does not simply show " the destructive ways this industry operates but also the opportunity to reinvent it " through " small choices [ that ] actually impact those [ big problems ] . " Ultimately , he considered his film an introduction to the topic that was able to connect several elements , any one of which would be worth being covered in a film .

 To coincide with Fashion Revolution Day , which seeks transparency in clothes production , the trailer of The True Cost was released on April 24 , 2015 . It premiered at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival on May 15 , when film producer Harvey Weinstein said , " This movie 's going to shock the fashion world " . A week before the official release , the crowd funders received personal links to allow them watch the film . It was released on May 29 through iTunes , video on demand services , DVD , Blu @-@ Ray , and in select theaters in Los Angeles , New York , and London , and has since been translated into 19 languages . After its release , companies that were subjects of the film , including H & M and Zara , defended themselves in a CNBC article . The film has been subject to dissonant reviews that ranged from extremely positive to very dismissive . Aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes says there were five positive reviews and three negative reviews ‍ — ‌ which indicates that 63 % of critics were favorable ‍ — ‌ and that it received an average score of 6 @.@ 3 . Based on one positive , two mixed , and one negative review , Metacritic assigns an average score of 46 out of 100 . It also received an Environmental Media Awards nomination for Best Documentary Film . 
 The New York Times reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis praised it for avoiding the dichotomy of " corporate greed versus environmental well @-@ being " , adding that instead of being an exposé , " Under the gentle , humane investigations of its director , what emerges most strongly is a portrait of exploitation that ought to make us more nauseated than elated over those $ 20 jeans " . Tamsin Blanchard of the Daily Telegraph called it a work that will " do for the fast fashion business what Food Inc did for fast food " . The Hollywood Reporter 's Frank Scheck commended it for approaching an issue often " untouched by major news organizations " . He said the film was " more despair @-@ inducing than instructive " , but was optimistic about its possible impact on the fashion culture , citing the effect that films such as Super Size Me and Fast Food Nation had on the fast food industry . Carson <unk> of Paste also compared it to the former film . David Noh of Film Journal International called it a " vitally important documentary " that contains scenes that " are enough to make you never want to go shopping again " . Gabrielle Wilson of MTV stated it is " hard to swallow but never feels preach @-@ y or like a barrage of depressive factoids " and will empower viewers to change their shopping habits . Casey Jarman said she was disappointed by " the only solution offered : eliminating global capitalism " ; however , ultimately , she wrote for Willamette Week that it is a " compelling film , which is , above all else , a badly needed conversation @-@ starter " . 
 Alan Scherstuhl wrote a very critical piece for The Village Voice ; he called the film predictable and repetitive , and said it contained several facts that have been clearly " common knowledge for years " . Scherstuhl said it is scattershot , " a litany of Things We Can All <unk> Are Bad " , but ultimately jumps between several topics ‍ — ‌ without sufficient detail , in his opinion ‍ — ‌ but comes to no conclusion or alternative . Scherstuhl said not even common people would have their beliefs challenged and that they would " dismiss it as the vague liberal agitprop that it is " . Similarly , while saying the film discusses important issues , both Genevieve Koski of The Dissolve and Jennie Kermode of Eye for Film said it deals with several themes quickly but does not expand upon any of them . Koski said , " The True Cost is methodical to a fault " , while Kermode said it is " a good starting point " on the topic . Fashion critic Vanessa Friedman said it has an " easy @-@ to @-@ swallow accessibility " but that it " <unk> " some aspects of the industry . In addition to commenting on the lack of attribution for " lots of eye @-@ popping statements " , she said , " trying to do everything , he skirted a lot of things " . The Los Angeles Times 's Martin Tsai criticized Morgan for interviewing his own executive producers , saying " the effects of fertilizers ... don 't appear quite as tangible " , and faulted Morgan for not exploring " retailer markups that could have gone toward improving sweatshop conditions instead of profit margins " , but appreciated that he had interviewed people with both pro and con views . Lizzie Crocker of The Daily Beast said Morgan had socialist views and that the film implies he wants to go back to the 1960s . She also criticized some interviewees , such as Miller , whom she called a " conspiracy theorist " , and Wolff , whom she called a " Marxist idealist " . Crocker was dismissive of the film , saying , " the film loses focus and credibility , criticizing not just the fashion industry but the global capitalist system that supports it " . 
 = Edward Ford ( physician ) = 
 Colonel Sir Edward Ford OBE , FRACP , FRCP ( 15 April 1902 – 27 August 1986 ) was an Australian soldier , academic and physician . He played an important role in the anti @-@ malaria campaign in the South West Pacific Area during the Second World War , and in preventative medicine in Australia after the war , but is best known for his Bibliography of Australian Medicine . 
 After the war , Ford wrote a thesis on malaria control in the South West Pacific , for which he was awarded his Doctor of Medicine ( MD ) degree by the University of Melbourne in 1946 . He became Director of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney in 1946 , and Professor of Preventive Medicine in 1947 , concurrently holding these two positions until his 1968 retirement . 
 = = Education and early life = = 
 Edward ( Ted ) Ford was born in <unk> , Victoria , on 15 April 1902 , the son of Edward John Knight Ford and his wife Mary <unk> , née Armstrong . His first job after leaving Clunes Higher Elementary School was as a telegraph boy at the Postmaster @-@ General 's Department ( PMG ) , which he joined in April 1917 , later working in its accounts branch . After he matriculated at the age of 24 he enrolled in an arts course at the University of Melbourne , but soon switched to medicine . He supported himself by continuing to work for the PMG by night . He graduated with his Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery ( MBBS ) degrees in 1932 , and did his residency at Melbourne Hospital . 
 Ford became a lecturer in anatomy at the university in 1933 , and became a senior lecturer in anatomy and histology in 1934 . While there he met Frederic Wood Jones , who shared and encouraged a passion for books . Ford would later dedicate his Bibliography of Australian Medicine 1790 – 1900 to Jones . Ford became interested in physical anthropology , and later tropical medicine . He moved to Sydney where he became a lecturer at the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney , from which he obtained a Graduate Diploma in Tropical Medicine in 1938 . 
 That year , he travelled to Papua where he conducted a study of sexually transmitted disease among the people of the Trobriand Islands , Goodenough Island and the D 'Entrecasteaux Islands for the Papuan administration . When he returned to Australia in 1939 , he became the Medical Officer in Charge of the Commonwealth Laboratory in Darwin . 
 = = Military career = = 
 In June 1940 , in the early months of the Second World War , Ford volunteered for service with the Second Australian Imperial Force and was commissioned as a major in the Australian Army Medical Corps , receiving the service number <unk> . In March 1941 he was sent to the Middle East as commanding officer of the 1st Australian Mobile Bacteriological Laboratory , and was soon engaged in the diagnosis of a variety of hitherto uncertain diseases . In July 1941 , Ford 's unit moved to Syria , where it was attached to the 2 / 3rd Casualty Clearing Station , providing the latter with the diagnostic capabilities of a larger general hospital , of which none were available . 
 Ford returned to Australia in March 1942 , and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August . He was appointed Assistant Director of Pathology , I Corps and New Guinea Force . To combat the danger of dysentery , Ford had all available supplies of sulphaguanidine in Australia shipped up to New Guinea , where Australian forces were fighting a desperate campaign against the Japanese . This was a new drug that Neil Hamilton Fairley had tested in the Middle East , and found to be effective . An initial dose of 4g followed by 2g doses at four hourly intervals was found to rapidly relieve the symptoms and permit the sufferers to travel . 
 New Guinea had numerous tropical diseases that posed a threat to the health and fitness of the troops fighting there , but the biggest medical problem was malaria . In December Ford took his case to the Commander in Chief ( and commander of New Guinea Force ) , General Sir Thomas Blamey . After being lectured by Ford for about an hour on the history and dangers of malaria , and what needed to be done , Blamey said : " I think I understand you , Colonel Ford . If I don 't do these things , my troops will suffer . " " What I have been trying to tell you , Sir , " Ford replied , " is that if you don 't do these things , you won 't have any bloody troops to suffer . " 
 Blamey liked officers who spoke to him like that . The effect was soon felt : 
 The over @-@ night appearance of a growing labour force , the clearing up of the hitherto obscure delays in supplies , the provision of a special officer to speed on these vital items to their destination and the emphasis laid on personal responsibility of all ranks brought about welcome changes . Of great importance too was the recognition of the principle that patients suffering from malaria should be as far as possible retained for treatment in New Guinea , and not sent back to Australia . 
 Blamey even wrote an article on malaria in New Guinea Force 's newspaper , Guinea Gold , in which he exhorted his men to take proper precautions against malaria . " Our worst enemy in New Guinea is not the Nip , " he wrote , " it 's the bite . " Gradually , the incidence of the once epidemic disease began to drop . For his part , Ford was mentioned in despatches for " gallant and distinguished services " . 
 In March 1943 , Ford was appointed <unk> at Allied Land Forces Headquarters ( LHQ ) in Melbourne . Here he was charged with responsibility for co @-@ ordinating the Army 's overall effort against malaria . In March 1945 , he became Director of Hygiene , Pathology and Entomology at LHQ , and in May he was promoted to colonel . For his services he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( Military Division ) on 19 July 1945 for his " skill , energy and initiative of a high order " . He was transferred to the Reserve of Officers on 25 June 1946 . After the war he served in the part @-@ time Citizen Military Forces , and was Director of Army Health from 1953 to 1964 .

 After the war , Ford wrote a thesis on malaria control in the South West Pacific , for which he was awarded his Doctor of Medicine ( MD ) degree by the University of Melbourne in 1946 . He received a Rockefeller Fellowship that allowed him to study at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , where he gained a Diploma of Public Health with distinction in 1947 . Ford became Director of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney in 1946 , and Professor of Preventive Medicine in 1947 , concurrently holding these two positions until his 1968 retirement . In addition , he was the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and a Fellow of the Senate from 1953 to 1957 , and was Acting Vice @-@ Chancellor of the University of Sydney from November 1960 until March 1961 . He was involved in the establishment of the medical school at the University of Western Australia , and was a member of the council of Macquarie University . 
 His wartime Army service was recognised in 1946 by his appointment as a fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians ( RACP ) in 1946 . He later served as its Vice @-@ President from 1970 to 1972 . He became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians ( RCP ) in London in 1958 , and also of the Royal Australian College of Medical Administrators , the Zoological Society , London , and the Royal Sanitary Institute , London . He was made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of <unk> of Australia in 1971 , and of the Royal Australian Historical Society in 1957 . On 1 January 1960 , he was created a knight bachelor . In 1969 the RCP and the RACP awarded him the Neil Hamilton Fairley medal , and he was granted an honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Sydney in 1971 . 
 Ford collected books , and he was a curator of the RACP library from 1958 until his death in 1986 . He donated some 2 @,@ 200 items to the library . Today other books from his collection can be found in the libraries of Latrobe University , Macquarie University and the University of Sydney , where the Burkitt @-@ Ford library is named in his honour . In 1976 , he published his Bibliography of Australian Medicine 1790 – 1900 . Benedetto ( " Ben " ) Haneman predicted that this work would be " one reason Ford 's name will be permanently recalled in any study of the historiography of Australian medicine . " Ford , who never married , died at his home in Potts Point , New South Wales , on 27 August 1986 and was cremated . Some of his papers are in the Mitchell Library in Sydney , while others can be found in the National Archives of Australia in Sydney . 
 = Kicking Television : Live in Chicago = 
 Kicking Television : Live in Chicago is a live album by Chicago alternative rock band Wilco , released on November 15 , 2005 by Nonesuch Records . The album consists of material from four live shows at Chicago 's Vic Theater recorded May 4 , 2005 to May 7 , 2005 . Although the band filmed the concerts , they decided not to release the footage as a DVD . It was the band 's first album with an expanded lineup featuring Nels Cline and Pat Sansone . 
 Kicking Television debuted on the Billboard 200 at number forty @-@ seven , and has since sold over 114 @,@ 000 copies . Critical reception to the album was generally positive . Publications such as The A.V. Club and Pitchfork Media lauded the band 's performance of material from Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost Is Born . 
 On April 17 , 2010 , for Record Store Day Wilco released an audiophile , 180 @-@ gram vinyl pressing of Kicking Television . The vinyl pressing , spread across four LP 's , included eight previously unreleased tracks recorded in May 2005 . 
 = = Production = = 
 Shortly after the release of A Ghost Is Born , Wilco 's fifth studio album , multi @-@ instrumentalist Leroy Bach left the band to pursue a career in theater production . To replace him , the band added jazz rock guitarist Nels Cline and multi @-@ instrumentalist Pat Sansone to their lineup . The lineup was expanded because lead singer Jeff Tweedy was concerned that the other members were multi @-@ tasking on instruments . This made performing material live from Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot difficult . While touring in support of Ghost , Wilco decided to record their first live album . 
 Wilco decided to use concerts from their hometown of Chicago " because [ they ] wanted to be really comfortable " . They chose a string of four consecutive shows from May 4 to May 7 , 2005 at The Vic Theater in Chicago , Illinois . The band recorded the four shows on a 24 @-@ track digital recorder . The shows were filmed for a potential DVD release , but the band decided not to release the footage . According to Tweedy , the band was disappointed by how the footage " sapped " the energy out of the performances . On September 13 , 2005 , the band announced that the album would be released on November 1 , 2005 . The release date was later delayed two weeks . 
 Most of the material from the album — 16 of 23 songs — is from Wilco 's two Nonesuch Records releases : Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost Is Born . The title track was an outtake from the Ghost recording sessions because the band considered it to be one of their most exciting songs live . Tweedy explained why it was chosen for the title : 
 A rock concert is " kicking television . " If you 're out of the house and with a bunch of people enjoying something together , that 's kicking television to me . I don 't think very many people , myself included , will ever kick television cold turkey , but I certainly think more people should be aware of what it 's doing to them . 
 Two live tracks from Summerteeth were also included on the album , as well as one song each from Being There , Mermaid Avenue and Mermaid Avenue Vol . II . The final track was a cover of " Comment ( If All Men Are Truly Brothers ) " , originally performed by Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band . " How to Fight Loneliness " ( from Summerteeth ) and " Monday " ( from Being There ) were included with purchase of the album on iTunes . 
 Guitarist Jeff Tweedy provided the lead vocals for the album and John Stirratt , the only other original member of the band , played bass guitar and added backing vocals . Lead guitarist Nels Cline and multi @-@ instrumentalist Pat Sansone performed here on a Wilco album for the first time . Glenn Kotche performed on the drums and other percussion instruments , and Mikael Jorgensen played keyboards . Other instrumentation was provided by Patrick Newbery ( trumpet and flugelhorn ) , Nick <unk> ( trombone ) , and Rick Parenti ( baritone sax ) .

 Kicking Television was well received by critics ; according to Metacritic , it was given a score of 85 out of 100 based on " universal acclaim " . Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club called the album " stellar " and expressed surprise over how well the A Ghost Is Born songs sounded live . Allmusic editor Mark Deming lauded the " new muscle and force " of the songs , and commented that " the élan of this band in full flight shows that the fun has been put back in Wilco . " Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media called the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot songs " still awesome " and remarked that " this is what A Ghost Is Born is supposed to sound like . " Hogan gave the album an 8 @.@ 3 out of 10 rating . Q named the album one of the top 20 live albums of all time . It also gave the album four stars out of five and said that " Live albums rarely come equipped with such a strong pulse . " 
 E ! Online gave the album an A and said that Wilco " [ turn ] each song up to 11 and [ let their ] rabid hometown fans provide thousand @-@ strong backing vocals . It 'll make you want to yell ' <unk> ! ' too . " Spin also gave it an A and stated : " Not since Grateful Dead 's Europe ' 72 has there been a live double album in which intimacy and expansiveness , guitar mess and piano reflection commingle this sweetly . " Billboard gave it a favorable review and said that Wilco had " never sounded better " . Ben Gilbert of Yahoo ! Music UK gave it eight stars out of ten and that the album " documents a band on fire and a frontman in clarion clear voice . " Under the Radar also gave it eight stars out of ten and said the album " Captures a band at the height of their creative powers . " Uncut gave it four stars out of five and said , " In this live setting , fascinatingly , the brutality to which the songs are subjected only serves to underscore their poignancy . " Blender also gave it four stars out of five and said it " sounds like a greatest hits set . " 
 Although most reviews applauded the effort , critics also expressed discontent with elements of the album . Hogan noted in his Pitchfork review that Tweedy 's banter was " ho @-@ hum " , and stated that " Kicking Television " and " The Late Greats " should have been cut from the album . Andrew <unk> of Stylus Magazine gave the album a B rating , but was disappointed with how the songs " find the band holding serve " .

 = Polonnaruwa Vatadage = 
 The Polonnaruwa Vatadage is an ancient structure dating back to the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa of Sri Lanka . It is believed to have been built during the reign of Parakramabahu I to hold the Relic of the tooth of the Buddha or during the reign of Nissanka Malla of Polonnaruwa to hold the alms bowl used by the Buddha . Both these venerated relics would have given the structure a great significance and importance at the time . Located within the ancient city of Polonnaruwa , it is the best preserved example of a <unk> in the country , and has been described as the " ultimate development " of this type of architecture . Abandoned for several centuries , excavation work at the Polonnaruwa Vatadage began in 1903 . 
 Built for the protection of a small stupa , the structure has two stone platforms decorated with elaborate stone carvings . The lower platform is entered through a single entrance facing the north , while the second platform can be accessed through four doorways facing the four cardinal points . The upper platform , surrounded by a brick wall , contains the stupa . Four Buddha statues are seated around it , each facing one of the entrances . Three concentric rows of stone columns had also been positioned here , presumably to support a wooden roof . The entire structure is decorated with stone carvings . Some of the carvings at the Polonnaruwa Vatadage , such as its sandakada <unk> , are considered to be the best examples of such architectural features . Although some archaeologists have suggested that it also had a wooden roof , this theory is disputed by others . 
 = = History = = 
 Theories vary among archaeologists and historians regarding who built the Polonnaruwa Vatadage , and when . One such theory suggests that it was built by Parakramabahu I during his reign in the 12th century . The Culavamsa , an ancient chronicle , mentions that he built a circular stone shrine to hold the tooth relic of the Buddha . Archaeologist Harry Charles Purvis Bell believed that this shrine is the Polonnaruwa Vatadage . This is contradicted by several ancient sources of the island , including Rajavaliya and <unk> , which mention that it was built by Nissanka Malla . However , according to the studies of Arthur Maurice <unk> , Nissanka Malla only renovated an already existing building and made some additions such as the entrance and outer porch . Wilhelm Geiger , who translated the ancient Mahavamsa , and historian H. W. Codrington both agree with this theory . A nearby stone inscription set by Nissanka Malla lists the Vatadage among his constructions . In this , he claims that it was built by one of his generals under his own direction . 
 A unique feature of architecture of ancient Sri Lanka , <unk> were built for the protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground . If the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is the shrine built by Parakramabahu I , the relic of the tooth of the Buddha would have been enshrined within it . Another possibility is that the alms bowl used by the Buddha may have been enshrined here . Both these relics were important objects in ancient Sri Lankan culture , and would have made the Polonnaruwa Vatadage one of the most significant and venerated buildings in the country . 
 The Kingdom of Polonnaruwa ended in 1215 with an invasion from South India . The Polonnaruwa Vatadage appears to have been abandoned with the fall of the kingdom , and there is no mention of it in the chronicles in later periods . It was not until 1903 that the Department of Archaeology began excavation work at the site under Bell , who noted that it was " only a mound of earth " at the time . 
 = = Location and appearance = = 
 The Polonnaruwa Vatadage is located in a quadrangular area known as the <unk> <unk> in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa . The <unk> <unk> contains some of the oldest and most sacred monuments of the city . The Polonnaruwa Vatadage , which occupies most of the south western area of it , is a prominent structure among them . It is the best preserved example of a Vatadage in the country , and is somewhat similar in design to those belonging to the Anuradhapura period , especially <unk> and <unk> . 
 The building has been built around a small stupa with a base diameter of 27 feet 8 inches ( 8 @.@ 43 m ) . The Vatadage has two levels ; the lower platform and the raised upper platform that contains the stupa . The upper platform is 80 feet ( 24 m ) in diameter , and the lower one 120 feet ( 37 m ) . The lower platform is 4 feet 3 inches ( 1 @.@ 30 m ) from ground level , and the upper platform is 5 feet 3 inches ( 1 @.@ 60 m ) from the lower . 
 The circular lower platform is entered through a single entrance on the northern side . Four elaborately constructed doorways lead from it to the upper platform , which is surrounded by a brick wall on its edge . These entrances are oriented to the four cardinal directions . The center of this platform is occupied by the stupa , which has four Buddha statues seated around it , each facing one of the entrances . Each of these statues are 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) high , and are seated on stone seats with a height of 2 feet 10 inches ( 0 @.@ 86 m ) each . Three concentric rows of stone columns had existed on the upper platform . Two of these rows , of which nothing remain , were within the brick wall , while the third row is just outside it . The inner row had consisted of 16 columns , the middle row of 20 , and the outer row of 32 . The existing stone columns of the outer ring are about 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) in height . 
 = = Architecture and stonemasonry = = 
 Employing citizens in construction and repairing works was done in ancient Sri Lanka as a form of tax payment . Such labour may also have been used in the construction of the Polonnaruwa Vatadage . However , the quality of the works indicate that most of the task may have been carried out by skilled craftsmen . Architecture of <unk> type structures was at its peak during the Polonnaruwa period , and the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is considered to be its " ultimate development " . Some of the most striking features of the structure are its elaborate stone carvings . The sandakada <unk> ( <unk> ) at the northern entrance and the two <unk> ( guard stone ) at the eastern entrance are considered to be the best examples of such architectural features belonging to the Polonnaruwa period . These <unk> elements were commonly placed at entrances to monastic buildings of ancient Sri Lanka , and historians believe that sandakada <unk> depict the cycle of Saṃsāra in Buddhism . According to Bell , the carvings on the sides of the upper platform are " unrivalled , whether at Anuradhapura or Polonnaruwa , and probably in any other Buddhist shrine of Ceylon " . 
 The straight , symmetrical stone columns found in the Polonnaruwa Vatadage are quite similar to those seen in buildings of the Anuradhapura period . The foot of each column is carved in the shape of a lotus flower . Archaeologist <unk> Paranavithana has suggested that these stone columns had supported a wooden roof . This is widely accepted , and nails and roof tiles found in excavations seem to support this . However , another theory is that the Vatadage did not have a roof , and the stone columns were used to hang lamps , curtains or Buddhist symbols . 
 The brick wall around the platform is in a considerably preserved state as well , although parts of it have broken off . It is quite thick — 2 feet 6 inches ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) — and was presumably constructed to protect the stupa from the sides . There is evidence that inner surface of the wall had been adorned with paintings . Its lower portion is covered by stone panels with carvings of a flower design . Below the wall , the side of the upper platform itself is decorated with carvings , as is the side of the lower platform . 
 The four Buddha statues , which depict the Dhyana mudra , are also carved from solid rock . Two of them are more or less intact today , while only parts of the other two remain . The stupa in the middle appears to have been of the <unk> ( bubble shaped ) design commonly seen in Sri Lanka . The upper part has been destroyed , and only the dome shaped lower part now remains . However , it has only two <unk> ( the rings found at the base of stupas ) rather than the traditional three .

 Liverpool Football Club ( / <unk> / ) is a Premier League association football club based in Liverpool , Merseyside , England . The club has won five European Cups , three UEFA Cups , three UEFA Super Cups , 18 League titles , seven FA Cups , a record eight League Cups , and 15 FA Community Shields . 
 The club was founded in 1892 and joined the Football League the following year . The club has played at Anfield since its formation . Liverpool established itself as a major force in both English and European football during the 1970s and 1980s when Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley led the club to 11 League titles and seven European trophies . Under the management of Rafa Benítez and captained by Steven Gerrard Liverpool became European champion for the fifth time , winning the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final against Milan in spite of being 3 – 0 down at half time . 
 Liverpool was the ninth highest @-@ earning football club in the world for 2013 – 14 , with an annual revenue of € 306 million , and the world 's eighth most valuable football club in 2015 , valued at $ 982 million . The club holds many long @-@ standing rivalries , most notably the North West Derby against Manchester United and the Merseyside derby with Everton . 
 The club 's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies . The first was the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985 , where escaping fans were pressed against a collapsing wall in the Heysel Stadium , with 39 people — mostly Italians and Juventus fans — losing their lives , after which English clubs were given a five @-@ year ban from European competition . The second was the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 , where 96 Liverpool supporters lost their lives in a crush against perimeter fencing . The team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all @-@ red home strip in 1964 which has been used ever since . The club 's anthem is " You 'll Never Walk Alone " . 
 = = History = = 
 Liverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding , club president and owner of the land at Anfield . After eight years at the stadium , Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield . Originally named " Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd " ( Everton Athletic for short ) , the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later , after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton . The team won the Lancashire League in its début season , and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893 – 94 season . After finishing in first place the club was promoted to the First Division , which it won in 1901 and again in 1906 . 
 Liverpool reached its first FA Cup Final in 1914 , losing 1 – 0 to Burnley . It won consecutive League championships in 1922 and 1923 , but did not win another trophy until the 1946 – 47 season , when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex @-@ West Ham Utd centre half George Kay . Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950 , playing against Arsenal . The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953 – 54 season . Soon after Liverpool lost 2 – 1 to non @-@ league Worcester City in the 1958 – 59 FA Cup , Bill Shankly was appointed manager . Upon his arrival he released 24 players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could discuss strategy ; here , Shankly and other " Boot Room " members Joe Fagan , Reuben Bennett , and Bob Paisley began reshaping the team . 
 The club was promoted back into the First Division in 1962 and won it in 1964 , for the first time in 17 years . In 1965 , the club won its first FA Cup . In 1966 , the club won the First Division but lost to Borussia Dortmund in the European Cup Winners ' Cup final . Liverpool won both the League and the UEFA Cup during the 1972 – 73 season , and the FA Cup again a year later . Shankly retired soon afterwards and was replaced by his assistant , Bob Paisley . In 1976 , Paisley 's second season as manager , the club won another League and UEFA Cup double . The following season , the club retained the League title and won the European Cup for the first time , but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final . Liverpool retained the European Cup in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979 . During Paisley 's nine seasons as manager Liverpool won 21 trophies , including three European Cups , a UEFA Cup , six League titles and three consecutive League Cups ; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup . 
 Paisley retired in 1983 and was replaced by his assistant , Joe Fagan . Liverpool won the League , League Cup and European Cup in Fagan 's first season , becoming the first English side to win three trophies in a season . Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985 , against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium . Before kick @-@ off , Liverpool fans breached a fence which separated the two groups of supporters , and charged the Juventus fans . The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse , killing 39 fans , mostly Italians . The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster . The match was played in spite of protests by both managers , and Liverpool lost 1 – 0 to Juventus . As a result of the tragedy , English clubs were banned from participating in European competition for five years ; Liverpool received a ten @-@ year ban , which was later reduced to six years . Fourteen Liverpool fans received convictions for involuntary manslaughter . 
 Fagan had announced his retirement just before the disaster and Kenny Dalglish was appointed as player @-@ manager . During his tenure , the club won another three League Championships and two FA Cups , including a League and Cup " Double " in the 1985 – 86 season . Liverpool 's success was overshadowed by the Hillsborough disaster : in an FA Cup semi @-@ final against Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 , hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed against perimeter fencing . Ninety @-@ four fans died that day ; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later and the 96th died nearly four years later , without regaining consciousness . After the Hillsborough disaster there was a government review of stadium safety . The resulting Taylor Report paved the way for legislation that required top @-@ division teams to have all @-@ seater stadiums . The report ruled that the main reason for the disaster was overcrowding due to a failure of police control .
