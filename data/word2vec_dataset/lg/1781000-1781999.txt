 Scully was a writer and co @-@ executive producer on Everybody Loves Raymond for part of season seven and all of season eight , winning an Emmy for his work . Scully co @-@ created ( with wife Julie Thacker ) The Pitts for Fox and Complete Savages for ABC , which was produced by Mel Gibson . The Pitts was a sitcom about a family suffering from bad luck . Thacker stated the show was designed " as a companion piece for The Simpsons . It had a very cartoony feel to it . We always knew the initial audience for the show would be 12 @-@ year @-@ olds to start , and then when families saw that the writing was very Simpsons - like , because many of the writers were from The Simpsons , [ we thought ] families would start to watch it together . " It was canceled after six episodes ; Scully and Thacker laid the blame for this on the show 's timeslot , 9 : 30 P.M. , which was too late for the target audience . Complete Savages , which Thacker and Scully wrote with the " Simpsons sensibility " of layered jokes , was canceled in January 2005 due to low ratings and network anger at Scully and Thacker 's decision to write to TV critics in what the Hartford Courant labelled " unsanctioned promoting " . A fan of NRBQ , Scully produced , with Thacker , a documentary about the band in 2003 entitled NRBQ : Rock ' n ' Roll 's Best Kept Secret ; Scully employed the group as the " unofficial house band " of The Simpsons during his tenure as showrunner . Scully also created a pilot for Fox called Schimmel in 2000 , starring Robert Schimmel , which was dropped after Schimmel was diagnosed with cancer . 
 Scully served as a consulting producer on the NBC series Parks and Recreation , and wrote the episodes " Ron and Tammy " in 2009 , and " The Possum " in 2010 . Scully also had a cameo role in the episode " Eagleton " as a speaker at the Pawnee community meeting . 
 In 2012 , Scully co @-@ produced and co @-@ wrote an animated TV version of the film Napoleon Dynamite , which was canceled after six episodes . That May , Scully signed a seven @-@ figure , multi @-@ year overall deal with 20th Century Fox Television to develop several projects . He served as co @-@ executive producer on the single @-@ season NBC sitcom The New Normal ( 2012 – 2013 ) , alongside Allison Adler and Ryan Murphy . Scully held the same title for Fox 's Dads ( which debuted in 2013 ) .

 = Boyle Roche = 
 Sir Boyle Roche , 1st Baronet ( October 1736 – 5 June 1807 ) was an Irish politician . After a distinguished career in North America with the British Army , Roche became a member of the Irish House of Commons in 1775 , generally acting in support of the viceregal government . He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politics — they were riddled with mixed metaphors ( " Mr Speaker , I smell a rat ; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky ; but I 'll nip him in the bud " ) , malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase ( " Why we should put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity , for what has posterity ever done for us ? " ) . Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan 's model for Mrs <unk> . While arguing for a bill , Roche once said , " It would surely be better , Mr. Speaker , to give up not only a part , but , if necessary , even the whole , of our constitution , to preserve the remainder ! " 
 While these Irish bulls have led many writers to portray Roche as a buffoon , other biographers have interpreted them not as blunders , but as calculated attempts to disarm opposition to ministerial policies through humour . Roche ended his political career with the passage of the Act of Union 1800 , which he supported . He chose not to attempt to enter the British House of Commons and retired on a government pension until his death , married but childless , in 1807 . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Early life , family background and military service = = = 
 Boyle Roche was born , the youngest of three sons , to Jordan Roche and Ellen White in County Galway in 1736 . His was an old and respectable Protestant family , said to be a junior branch of the ancient baronial house of Roche , Viscount Fermoy from which Diana , Princess of Wales , descended . The family were also no strangers to politics : Roche 's great @-@ grandfather had been elected mayor of Limerick four times . Roche 's older brother was Tiger Roche , a celebrated duellist and adventurer . 
 Boyle Roche entered the army at an early age , and served in the so @-@ called American war ( that is , the American portion of the Seven Years ' War ) . There are reports of a Lieutenant Boyle Roche in Rogers ' Rangers who was captured by the French during The Battle on Snowshoes ( near what is now Lake George , New York in March 1758 ) and later returned to his regiment . It is possible that Roche served with Wolfe at the Siege of Quebec in 1759 ; it is a certainty that he distinguished himself in 1762 during the capture of El Morro in Havana . By 1770 he had become a major in the 28th Foot . He was knighted for his bravery at El Morro in 1776 . 
 Retiring from the army , he obtained an office in the Irish revenue department in 1775 . In the same year , Boyle Roche entered the Irish House of Commons as Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Tralee , a seat he held until 1776 . 
 Although he was one of the first volunteers to fight the rebellious colonials in 1776 , his contribution to that conflict was mainly in the area of recruitment — he successfully enlisted 500 volunteers in one weekend in Limerick alone , a feat which so gratified Lord Kenmare that he paid Roche an additional bounty of half a guinea per man . Roche 's flamboyant recruiting methods were described by the Edinburgh Advertiser as follows : 
 Yesterday Major <unk> Roche , representative in parliament for Tralee ( who is raising a body of men for his Majesty 's service ) began recruiting here , and met with great success , which is not surprising , if we consider his connexions , and the uncommon support he has received from the noblemen and gentlemen of this province . His method of enlisting was as uncommon as it was pleasing to those who viewed the procession , which was as follows : Major Roche , bearing a large purse of gold . Captain Cowley . A great number of likely recruits . An elegant band of music , consisting of French horns , <unk> [ oboes ] , <unk> , and bassoons , playing God Save the King . A large brewer 's dray , with five @-@ barrels of beer , the horse richly caparisoned and ornamented with <unk> . Two <unk> with cockades to serve the beer , The recruiting serjeant . Drums [ and ] fifes . Another division of recruits . The returning soldiers . Prodigious concourse of [ spectators ? ] . The following speech was made by Major Roche to the populace : Being appointed , through the favour of [ our ] most excellent governor , to raise a body of men for the service of his Majesty , I think it [ a ] most happy circumstance of my life to be the instrument of leading you to honour and renown . The laurels fought for and obtained in all parts [ of ] the globe [ through ] war , have procured us a fame so glorious as not to be equalled by people in any fame not to be sullied by the assaults of prejudice , nor the effects of time : not an action in which we were not victorious , not a siege in which we were not honoured . Will you , my dear countrymen , permit those laurels to fade , or those actions to be forgotten ? No , forbid it , heaven ! Let us now that we have it in our power convey to later posterity a renewal of our fidelity , and a confirmation of our loyalty . A more critical period never presented itself , nor had we ever a fairer opportunity of shewing our attachment to the illustrious house of Hanover , than the present , as his Majesty 's deluded subjects in America are in open rebellion , and like unnatural children , wound their ever indulgent parent , forgetting the torrents of blood spilt , and heap of treasure expended for their preservation . His Sacred Majesty now calls and our fidelity obliges us , and I hope your instinct prompts you , to obey the dictates of so [ grand ] a master . Let us then , my brave and loyal countrymen , join hearts and hands and cheerfully step forth in the glorious cause of our Creator , our King and our Country . 
 In Dublin , Roche was a member of the Kildare Street Club . 
 = = = Member of Parliament = = = 
 Roche continued on in the Grattan Parliament , representing Gowran from 1777 to 1783 , <unk> from 1784 to 1790 , Tralee ( again ) from 1790 to 1798 and Old <unk> from 1798 until the union with Great Britain in 1801 . From the beginning of his parliamentary career Roche ranged himself on the side of the government , and for his services he was granted a pension , appointed chamberlain to the viceregal court , and on 30 November 1782 was created a baronet . For the office of chamberlain he was thought to be " eminently qualified by his handsome figure , graceful address and ready wit , qualities which were set off by a frank , open and manly disposition . " 
 It was during this period ( in 1782 ) that Roche coined the term " Protestant Ascendancy " . 
 Apparently , members of the cabinet wrote speeches for Sir Boyle which he somewhat imperfectly committed to memory , in general mastering the substance but frequently producing , through his love of language and ornament , travesties on the original words . Through this he gained his lasting reputation as an inveterate perpetrator of Irish bulls . 
 Boyle 's memory was indeed excellent . On one occasion he illustrated both the accuracy of his memory and the audacity of his character at the expense of a brother member . Edmond Stanley , anxious to produce an effect in an important debate , had been at pains to reduce his speech to writing . Unluckily , Stanley happened to drop his manuscript in the coffee @-@ room , and walked back into the House unconscious of his loss . Sir Boyle , finding the document , speedily mastered its contents , and , rising at the first opportunity , delivered the speech almost verbatim in the hearing of its dismayed and astonished author . His apology afterward only added insult to injury : 
 Here , my dear Stanley , is your speech again , and I thank you kindly for the loan of it . I never was so much at a loss for a speech in the whole course of my life , and sure it is not a pin the worse for the wear . 
 On another occasion , he amused and relieved the House , irritated by the prospect of being obliged to listen to the reading of a mass of documents as a preliminary to a resolution , by suggesting that a dozen or so clerks be called in who might read the documents simultaneously and thus dispose of the business in a few minutes . 
 Beyond these efforts , he was also the author of a bill to enact , among other things , that " Every quart bottle should contain a quart . " 
 = = = The Volunteer Convention = = = 
 The chief service Boyle Roche rendered his government was in connection with the Volunteer Convention of November 1783 , in which he " acted a part only less remarkable than his immunity from the opprobrium which might have been expected to attach to it . " The question of admitting the Roman Catholics to the franchise was at the time being agitated , and found many warm supporters in the convention . The proposal was extremely obnoxious to the Irish government , and on the second day of the meeting the secretary of state , George Ogle , announced that the Roman Catholics , in the person of Lord Kenmare , had relinquished the idea of making any claim further than the religious liberty they then enjoyed , and gave as his authority for this extraordinary statement Sir Boyle Roche , by whom it was confirmed ! 
 Ten days later Lord Kenmare ( who had not been in Dublin at the time ) denied that he had given the least authority to any person to make any such statement in his name . However , his disavowal came too late : the anti @-@ Catholic party in the convention had found time to organize themselves , and when the intended Reform Bill took shape it was known that the admission of Roman Catholics to the franchise was not to form part of the scheme . 
 Several months later ( on Valentine 's Day ) , Sir Boyle explained himself in a public letter , starting with a description of his alarm upon hearing that the bishop of Derry ( then Frederick Hervey ) and his associates were bent on extending the legislative privilege : 
 I thought a crisis was arrived in which Lord Kenmare and the heads of that body should step forth to disavow those <unk> projects , and to profess their attachment to the lawful powers . Unfortunately , his lordship was at a great distance , and most of my other friends were out of the way . I therefore resolved on a bold stroke , and authorized only by the sentiments of the persons in question , [ took action ] . 
 He added that while he regretted that his message had been disowned by Lord Kenmare , that was of less consequence , since his manoeuvre had succeeded to admiration . Some believe that Sir Boyle , who was related to Lord Kenmare and often represented his views in Commons , was also stating Lord Kenmare 's true views on this occasion and doing so with his full knowledge , but in a way that provided Kenmare plausible deniability . 
 Sir Boyle fought hard for the Union : 
 Gentlemen may tither , and tither , and tither , and may think it a bad measure ; but their heads at present are hot , and will so remain till they grow cool again , and so they can 't decide right now , but when the day of judgement comes then honourable gentlemen will be satisfied with this most excellent union . 
 For himself , he declared that his love for England and Ireland was so great that he " would have the two sisters embrace like one brother . " 
 = = = His life in politics = = = 
 Those who placidly accept the judgement that Boyle Roche was " the Fool of the Grattan Parliament " should reflect on the fact that for almost 25 years he served as Gentleman Usher and Master of Ceremonies to the Irish Court , " an office for which a dignified and decorous demeanor is among the chief essentials . " 
 Roche was also capable of humour which was both subtle and unquestionably intentional . Once , upon hearing his opponent John Philpot Curran <unk> that he could be " the guardian of his own honour " , Sir Boyle offered his " congratulations to the honourable member on his possession of a sinecure . " On another occasion , when the Opposition tried to cough him down in a debate , Sir Boyle met the interruption by producing some bullets , with the observation " I have here some excellent pills to cure a cough . " His personal courage being beyond dispute , this jest was quite sufficient in those duelling days to procure attention for the remainder of his speech . 
 = = = Marriage , retirement and death = = = 
 On 20 October 1778 , Boyle Roche married Mary Frankland of Great <unk> Hall , near Thirsk , Yorkshire , daughter of Admiral Sir Thomas Frankland , Bt , whose family name goes back to the time of William the Conqueror . Although childless , Boyle and Lady Mary appeared to have lived a life of uninterrupted happiness . 
 After the Union and the dissolution of the Irish Parliament , Boyle received a £ 400 pension , and in addition £ 300 annually in his capacity as " Surveyor of Kenmare River , " a post which had been invented as a reward and required no work . Thus provided for , he was able to spend the rest of his days in comfort . 
 Boyle Roche died at his house in 63 Eccles Street , Dublin , on 5 June 1807 , and was buried in St. Mary 's Church , Dublin , on 9 June . Mary lived on until 1831 . 
 = = Boyle Roche 's bird = = 
 Roche is perhaps best known for once excusing an absence in Parliament thus : " Mr. Speaker , it is impossible I could have been in two places at once , unless I were a bird . " This quotation was referenced by Ambrose Bierce in The Devil 's Dictionary in his definition of ubiquity : 
 In recent times ubiquity has not always been understood — not even by Sir Boyle Roche , for example , who held that a man cannot be in two places at once unless he is a bird . 
 But Roche was not uttering a <unk> here , he was quoting , and quoting correctly . The line appears in <unk> ’ s play , The Devil of a Wife , as follows : 
 Wife : I cannot be in two places at once . 
 Husband ( Rowland ) : Surely no , unless thou <unk> a bird . 
 = Battle of Messines ( 1917 ) = 
 The Battle of Messines ( 7 – 14 June 1917 ) was an offensive conducted by the British Second Army , under the command of General Sir Herbert Plumer , on the Western Front near the village of Messines in West Flanders , Belgium , during the First World War . The Nivelle Offensive in April and May had failed to achieve its more ambitious aims , led to the demoralisation of French troops and the dislocation of the Anglo @-@ French strategy for 1917 . The offensive at Messines forced the Germans to move reserves to Flanders from the Arras and Aisne fronts , which relieved pressure on the French . The tactical objective of the attack at Messines was to capture the German defences on the ridge , which ran from Ploegsteert ( Plugstreet ) Wood in the south , through Messines and Wytschaete to Mt . Sorrel , to deprive the German 4th Army of the high ground south of Ypres . The ridge commanded the British defences and back areas further north , from which the British intended to conduct the " Northern Operation " , to advance to Passchendaele Ridge , then capture the Belgian coast up to the Dutch frontier . 
 The Second Army had five corps , of which three conducted the attack and two remained on the northern flank , not engaged in the main operation ; the XIV Corps was available in General Headquarters reserve ( GHQ reserve ) . The 4th Army divisions of Gruppe Wijtschate ( Group Wytschaete ) held the ridge , which were later reinforced by a division from Gruppe Ypern . The battle began with the detonation of a series of mines beneath German lines , which created 19 large craters and devastated the German front line defences . This was followed by a creeping barrage 700 yards ( 640 m ) deep , covering the British troops as they secured the ridge , with support from tanks , cavalry patrols and aircraft . The effectiveness of the British mines , barrages and bombardments was improved by advances in artillery survey , flash @-@ spotting and centralised control of artillery from the Second Army headquarters . British attacks from 8 – 14 June advanced the front line beyond the former German Sehnen ( Oosttaverne ) line . The Battle of Messines was a prelude to the much larger Third Battle of Ypres campaign , the preliminary bombardment for which began on 11 July 1917 . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = British plans 1916 – 1917 = = = 
 In 1916 , the British planned to clear the German army from the Belgian coast to prevent them from using the coastal ports as bases from which to attack merchant ships and troop transports in the North Sea and English Channel . In January 1916 , General Sir Herbert Plumer recommended to Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig the capture of Messines Ridge ( part of the southern arc of the Ypres Salient ) before an operation to capture the Gheluvelt plateau further north . 
 The Flanders campaign was postponed , because of the German offensive at Verdun and the demands of the Battle of the Somme . When it became apparent that the Nivelle Offensive ( 16 April – 9 May 1917 ) had failed to achieve its most ambitious objectives , Haig instructed the Second Army to capture the Messines – Wytschaete Ridge as soon as possible . Haig intended to force the Germans to move troops away from the French armies on the Aisne front , where demoralisation amid the failure of the Nivelle Offensive had led to a number of mutinies . British operations in Flanders would relieve pressure on the French Army , as the Battle of the Somme had done . The capture of Messines Ridge would give the British control of the strategically important ground on the southern flank of the Ypres Salient , shorten the front , deprive the Germans of observation over British positions further north and would occupy ground from which the British could observe the southern slope of Menin Ridge at the west end of the Gheluvelt plateau , in preparation for a larger offensive in the Ypres Salient . 
 The front line around Ypres had changed relatively little since the end of the Second Battle of Ypres ( 22 April – 25 May 1915 ) . The British held the city , while the Germans held the high ground of the Messines – Wytschaete Ridge to the south , the lower ridges to the east and the flat ground to the north . The Ypres front was a salient bulging into the German lines but was overlooked by German artillery observers on the higher ground . The British had little ground observation of the German rear areas and valleys east of the ridges . 
 The ridges ran north and east from Messines , 264 feet ( 80 m ) above sea @-@ level at its highest point , past " Clapham Junction " at the west end of the Gheluvelt plateau , 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) from Ypres at 213 feet ( 65 m ) and Gheluvelt which was above 164 feet ( 50 m ) to Passchendaele , 5 @.@ 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) from Ypres at 164 feet ( 50 m ) above sea @-@ level , declining from there to a plain further north . <unk> varied from negligible , to 1 : 60 at Hooge and 1 : 33 at Zonnebeke . Underneath the soil was London clay , sand and silt . Since the First Battle of Ypres in 1914 , much of the drainage in the area had been destroyed by artillery @-@ fire , although some repairs had been achieved by army Land Drainage Companies brought from England . The area was considered by the British to be drier than Loos , Givenchy and Plugstreet Wood further south .

 = = = British offensive preparations = = = 
 The Second Army devised a centralised artillery plan of great sophistication , following the practice established at the Battle of Arras in April 1917 . The use of field survey , gun calibration , weather data and a new and highly accurate 1 : 10 @,@ 000 scale map , gave British artillery much improved accuracy . Target @-@ finding became systematic , with the use of new sound @-@ ranging equipment , better organisation of flash @-@ spotting and the communication of results through the Army Report Centre at Locre Château . Second Army counter @-@ battery artillery bombardments increased from twelve in the week ending 19 April , to 438 in the last ten days before the attack . A survey of captured ground after the battle found that 90 percent of the German artillery positions had been plotted . The 2nd Field Survey Company also assisted the mining companies by establishing the positions of objectives within the German lines , using intersection and a special series of aerial photographs . The company surveyed advanced artillery positions , so that guns moving forward to them once the battle had begun could begin firing as soon as they arrived at the positions . 
 The British had begun a mining offensive against the German @-@ held Wijtschate ( sic ) salient in 1916 . Sub @-@ surface conditions were especially complex and separate ground water tables made mining difficult . To overcome the technical difficulties , two military geologists assisted the miners from March 1916 , including Edgeworth David , who planned the system of mines . Sappers dug the tunnels into a layer of " blue clay " 80 – 120 feet ( 24 – 37 m ) below the surface , then drifted galleries for 5 @,@ 964 yards ( 5 @,@ 453 m ) to points deep underneath Group Wytschaete 's front lines , despite German counter @-@ mining . German tunnellers came within metres of several British mine chambers , found the mine at La Petite Douve Farm and wrecked the chamber with a <unk> . The British diverted the attention of German miners from their deepest galleries , by making many secondary attacks in the upper levels . Co @-@ ordinated by tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers , Canadian , Australian , New Zealand and British miners laid 26 mines with 447 long tons ( 454 t ) of ammonal explosive . The British knew of the importance the Germans placed on holding the Wijtschate salient , after a captured corps order from Gruppe Wijtschate stating " that the salient be held at all costs " was received by Haig on 1 June . In the week before the attack , 2 @,@ 230 guns and howitzers bombarded the German trenches , cut wire , destroyed strong @-@ points and conducted counter @-@ battery fire against 630 German artillery pieces , using 3 @,@ 561 @,@ 530 shells . 
 In May , the 4th Australian , 11th and 24th divisions were moved north from Arras , to become reserve divisions for those corps in the Second Army which were preparing to attack Messines Ridge . Seventy @-@ two of the new Mark IV tanks also arrived in May and were hidden south @-@ west of Ypres . British aircraft began to move north from the Arras front , the total rising to about 300 operational aircraft in II Brigade in the Second Army area . The mass of artillery to be used in the attack was supported by many artillery observation and photographic reconnaissance aircraft , in corps squadrons which had been increased from twelve to eighteen aircraft . Strict enforcement of wireless procedures allowed a reduction of the minimum distance between observation aircraft from 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) at Arras in April 1917 to 400 yards ( 370 m ) at Messines , without mutual wireless interference . Wire @-@ cutting began on 21 May and an extra two days were added to the bombardment for more counter @-@ battery fire . The main bombardment began on 31 May , with only one day of poor weather before the attack . Two flights of each observation squadron concentrated on counter @-@ battery observation and one became a " bombardment flight " , working with particular artillery ' " bombardment groups " for wire @-@ cutting and trench @-@ destruction ; these flights became " contact @-@ patrol flights " intended to observe the positions of British troops once the assault began . The attack barrage was rehearsed on 3 June to allow British air observers to plot masked German batteries , which mainly remained hidden but many minor flaws in the British barrage were reported . A repeat performance on 5 June induced a larger number of hidden German batteries to reveal themselves . 
 The 25th Division made its preparations on a front from the Wulverghem – Messines road to the Wulverghem – Wytschaete road , facing 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) of the German front line , which tapered to the final objective 700 yards ( 640 m ) wide at the near crest of the ridge , 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) distant , behind nine German defensive lines . The advance would begin up a short rise to the near edge of the Steenbeek Valley , then up the steep rise from the valley floor between Hell and Sloping Roof Farms to Four Huns , Chest and Middle Farms on the main ridge , with Lumm Farm on the left flank of the objective . Artillery emplacements for the 25th divisional artillery and 112th Army Field Brigade were built and the Guards Division field artillery was placed in concealed forward positions . Road making and the construction of dug @-@ outs and communication trenches took place between 12 – 30 April and between 11 May – 6 June . An assembly trench was dug 150 yards ( 140 m ) from the German front line , in three hours on the night of 30 / 31 May , complete with communication trenches and barbed wire . Bridges and ladders were delivered in the two days before the attack . 13 @,@ 000 yards ( 12 @,@ 000 m ) of telephone cable was dug in at least 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) deep , which withstood fifty German artillery hits before the British attack . 
 Large numbers of posts , from which machine @-@ guns were to fire an overhead barrage were built and protective pits were dug for mules , which were to carry loads of 2 @,@ 000 rounds of ammunition to advanced troops . Three field companies of engineers with a pioneer battalion were kept in reserve , to follow up the attacking infantry and rebuild roads and work on defensive positions as ground was consolidated . The artillery in support of the division devised a creeping and standing barrage plan and time @-@ table , tailored to the estimated rates of advance of the infantry units . The standing barrage lifts were to keep all trenches within 1 @,@ 500 yards ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) of the infantry under continuous fire and targets fired on by 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch howitzer , 6 @-@ inch howitzer and 8 @-@ inch howitzers were to change from them only when infantry got within 300 yards ( 270 m ) . The 18 @-@ pounder field gun standing barrages would then jump over the creeping barrages , to the next series of objectives . The concealed guns of the Guards Division field artillery were to join the creeping barrage for the advance at 4 : 50 a.m. and at 7 : 00 a.m. the 112th Army Field Brigade was to advance to the old front line , to be ready for an anticipated German counter @-@ attack by 11 : 00 a.m. 
 The 47th Division planned to attack with two brigades , each reinforced by a battalion from the reserve brigade , along either side of the Ypres – Comines Canal . Large numbers of machine @-@ guns were organised to fire offensive and defensive barrages and signal detachments were organised to advance with the infantry . An observation balloon was reserved for messages by signal lamp from the front line , as insurance against the failure of telephone lines and message @-@ runners . The divisional trench mortar batteries were to bombard the German front line opposite the 142nd Brigade , where it was too close for the artillery to shell without endangering British troops . Wire @-@ cutting began in mid @-@ May , against considerable local retaliation by German artillery . At the end of May the two attacking brigades began training at <unk> , on practice courses built to resemble the German positions to be attacked , using air reconnaissance photographs to mark the positions of machine @-@ gun posts and hidden barbed wire . Divisional intelligence summaries were used to plan the capture of German company and battalion headquarters . The 140th Brigade with four tanks attached , was to occupy White Château and the adjacent part of <unk> , while the 142nd Brigade attacked the spoil heaps and the canal bank to the left . On 1 June , the British artillery began the intense stage of preparatory bombardment for trench @-@ destruction and wire cutting and the two attacking brigades assembled for the attack from 4 – 6 June . 
 British fighter aircraft tried to prevent German aircraft observing for their artillery , by dominating the air from the British front line to the German balloon line , about 10 @,@ 000 yards ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) beyond . Better aircraft like the Bristol Fighter , S.E.5a and the naval Sopwith Triplane had entered service since Arras and matched the performance of the German Albatros D.III and Halberstadt <unk> fighters . The " barrage line " was patrolled all day for the week before the attack , by fighters at 15 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) with more at 12 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) in the centre of the attack front . No British corps aircraft were shot down by German aircraft until 7 June , when 29 corps aircraft were able to direct artillery fire simultaneously over the three attacking corps . Behind the barrage line lay a second line of defence , which used wireless interception to take bearings on German artillery observation aircraft and guide British aircraft into areas where German flights were most frequent . By June 1917 , each British army had a control post of two aeroplane compass stations and an aeroplane intercepting station , linked by telephone to the army wing headquarters , fighter squadrons , the anti @-@ aircraft commander and the corps heavy artillery headquarters . 
 The new anti @-@ aircraft communication links allowed areas threatened by German bombardment to be warned , German artillery spotting aircraft to be attacked and German artillery batteries to be fired on when they revealed themselves . From 1 – 7 June , II Brigade had 47 calls through wireless interception , shot down one German aircraft , damaged seven and stopped 22 German artillery bombardments . Normal offensive patrols continued beyond the barrage line out to a line from Ypres to Roulers and Menin , where large formations of British and German aircraft clashed in long dogfights , once German air reinforcements began operating in the area . Longer @-@ range bombing and reconnaissance flights concentrated on German @-@ occupied airfields and railway stations and the night bombing specialists of No. 100 Squadron RFC attacked trains around Lille , Courtrai , Roulers and Comines . Two squadrons were reserved for close air support on the battlefield and low attacks on German airfields . 
 = = = Plan of attack = = = 
 The British planned to advance on a 17 @,@ 000 @-@ yard ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) front , from St. Yves to Mt . Sorrel east to the Oosttaverne line , a maximum depth of 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) . Three intermediate objectives to be reached a day at a time became halts , where fresh infantry would leap @-@ frog through to gain the ridge in one day . In the afternoon a further advance down the ridge was to be made . The attack was to be conducted by three corps of the Second Army ( General Sir Herbert Plumer ) : II Anzac Corps in the south @-@ east was to advance 800 yards ( 730 m ) , IX Corps in the centre was to attack on a 5 @,@ 000 yards ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) front , which would taper to 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) at the summit and X Corps in the north had an attack front of 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) . The corps planned their attacks under the supervision of the army commander , using as guides , the analyses of the Somme operations of 1916 and successful features of the attack at Arras on 9 April . Great care was taken in the planning of counter @-@ battery fire , the artillery barrage time @-@ table and machine @-@ gun barrages . 
 German artillery positions and the second ( Höhen ) line were not visible to British ground observers . For observation over the rear slopes of the ridge , 300 aircraft were concentrated in II Brigade RFC and eight balloons of II Kite Balloon Wing were placed 3 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 – 1 @,@ 520 m ) behind the British front line . The Second Army artillery commander , Major @-@ General George Franks , co @-@ ordinated the corps artillery plans , particularly the heavy artillery arrangements to suppress German artillery , which were devised by the corps and divisional artillery commanders . The Second Army Report Centre at Locre Château was linked by buried cable to each corps report centre , corps heavy artillery headquarters , divisional artillery headquarters , RFC squadrons , balloon headquarters , survey stations and wireless stations . Responsibility for counter @-@ battery fire was given to a counter @-@ battery staff officer with a small staff , who concentrated exclusively on the defeat of the German artillery . A conference was held each evening by the counter @-@ battery staffs of divisions and corps , methodically to collate the day 's reports from observation aircraft and balloons , field survey companies , sound ranging sections and forward observation officers . Each corps had a counter @-@ battery area , which was divided into zones and allotted to heavy artillery groups . Each heavy artillery group headquarters divided their zones into map squares , which were allotted to artillery batteries , required to be ready swiftly to open fire on them . 
 The attacking corps organised their heavy artillery within the army plan according to local conditions . II Anzac Corps created four counter @-@ battery groups , each with one heavy artillery group and IX Corps arranged four similar groups and five bombardment groups , one for each of the three IX Corps divisions making the initial attack and two ( with the heaviest howitzers ) in reserve , under the control of the corps heavy artillery commander . A Heavy Artillery Group Commander was attached to each divisional artillery headquarters , to command the heavy artillery once the infantry attack began . Field artillery arrangements within corps also varied , in IX Corps groups and sub @-@ groups were formed so that infantry brigades had an artillery liaison officer and two sub @-@ groups , one with six 18 @-@ pounder batteries and one with six 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch howitzer batteries . Surplus field artillery brigade headquarters planned forward moves for the guns and were kept ready to replace casualties . It was expected that much of the artillery would need to switch rapidly from the bombardment plan to engage counter @-@ attacking German infantry . It was planned that the Forward Observation Officers of the divisions in the first attack onto the ridge would control the artillery which had remained in place and the reserve divisions advancing down the far slope to the Oosttaverne line would control the artillery hidden close to the front line and the artillery which advanced into no @-@ man 's @-@ land . 
 Franks planned to neutralise German guns within 9 @,@ 000 yards ( 8 @,@ 200 m ) of the attack front . On the flanks of the British attack front of 17 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) , 169 German guns had been located , for which 42 British guns ( 25 percent of the German total ) were set aside . The 299 German guns in the path of the attack were each to be engaged by a British gun , a formula which required 341 British guns and howitzers to be reserved for counter @-@ battery fire . Every 45 yards ( 41 m ) of front had a medium or heavy howitzer for bombardment , which required 378 guns , with 38 super @-@ heavy guns and howitzers ( 5 percent ) deployed with the field artillery that was due to fire the creeping and standing barrages . Franks devised a bombardment timetable and added arrangements for a massed machine @-@ gun barrage . The 756 medium and heavy guns and howitzers were organised in forty groups and the 1 @,@ 510 field guns and howitzers in sixty @-@ four field artillery brigades within the attacking divisions and thirty @-@ three Army field artillery brigades , divided among the three attacking corps . Ammunition weighing 144 @,@ 000 long tons ( 146 @,@ 000 t ) was delivered with 1 @,@ 000 shells for each 18 @-@ pounder , 750 shells per 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch howitzer , 500 rounds for each medium and heavy piece and another 120 @,@ 000 gas and 60 @,@ 000 smoke shells for the 18 @-@ pounder field guns . 
 Two thirds of the 18 @-@ pounders were to fire a creeping barrage of shrapnel immediately ahead of the advance , while the remainder of the field guns and 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch howitzers were to fire a standing barrage , 700 yards ( 640 m ) further ahead on German positions and lift to the next target , when the infantry came within 400 yards ( 370 m ) of the barrage . Each division was given four extra batteries of field artillery , which could be withdrawn from the barrage at the divisional commander 's discretion to engage local targets . The field batteries of the three reserve divisions were placed in camouflaged positions , close to the British front line . As each objective was taken by the infantry , the creeping barrage was to pause 150 – 300 yards ( 140 – 270 m ) ahead and become a standing barrage , while the infantry consolidated . During this time the pace of fire was to slacken to one round per @-@ gun per @-@ minute , allowing the gun @-@ crews a respite , before resuming full intensity as the barrage moved on . The heavy and super @-@ heavy artillery was to fire on German artillery positions and rear areas and 700 machine @-@ guns were to fire a barrage over the heads of the advancing troops . 
 At 03 : 00 a.m. the mines would be detonated , followed by the attack of nine divisions onto the ridge . The blue line ( first objective ) was to be occupied by zero + 1 : 40 hours followed by a two @-@ hour pause . At zero + 3 : 40 hours the advance to the black line ( second objective ) would begin and consolidation was to start by zero + 5 : 00 hours . Fresh troops from the unengaged brigades of the attacking divisions or from the reserve divisions would then pass through , to attack the Oosttaverne line at zero + 10 : 00 hours . As soon as the black line was captured , all guns were to bombard the Oosttaverne line , conduct counter @-@ battery fire and place a standing barrage beyond the black line . All operational tanks were to join with the 24 held in reserve , to support the infantry advance to the Oosttaverne line . 
 = = = German defensive preparations = = = 
 The Messines defences were on a forward slope , overlooked from Haubourdin Hill ( Hill 63 ) south of the Douve valley and Kemmel Hill , 5 @,@ 000 yards ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) west of Wijtschate , an arrangement which the experience of 1916 showed to be obsolete . A new line incorporating the revised principles of defence derived from the experience of the Battle of the Somme , known as Flandern I , was begun in February 1917 . The first section began 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) behind Messines Ridge , running north from the Lys to <unk> then <unk> and <unk> , where the nearest areas giving good artillery observation to the west were found . In April , Field Marshal Crown Prince Rupprecht and his chief of staff , Lieutenant @-@ General Hermann von Kuhl , favoured withdrawal to the Warneton ( third ) line , before a British attack . The local divisional commanders objected , due to their belief that counter @-@ mining had neutralised the British underground threat and the inadequacy of the Warneton line . The convex eastern slope limited artillery observation and the Ypres – Comines canal and the river Lys restricted the space below the ridge where infantry could manoeuvre for counter @-@ attacks . British observation from the ridge would make the ground to the east untenable as far as Flandern I 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) beyond . A withdrawal that far would uncover the southern slopes of Menin Ridge , which was the most vital part of the Flandern position . Rupprecht re @-@ examined the Warneton ( third ) line and the extra Sehnen line ( Oosttaverne line to the British ) between the Warneton Line and the <unk> ( second ) line and dropped the withdrawal proposal . 
 Gruppe Wijtschate with three divisions under the command of the headquarters of XIX Corps ( General Maximilian von Laffert ) , held the ridge , as part of the 4th Army ( General Friedrich Bertram <unk> von Armin ) . The ridge garrison was reinforced with the 24th Division in early May . The 35th and 3rd Bavarian divisions were brought up as Eingreif divisions and Gruppe Wijtschate was substantially reinforced with artillery , ammunition and aircraft . The vulnerability of the northern end of Messines Ridge , where it met the Menin Ridge , led to the German command limiting the frontage of the 204th ( Württemberg ) Division to 2 @,@ 600 yards ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) . The 24th Division to the south held 2 @,@ 800 yards ( 2 @,@ 600 m ) and the 2nd Division at Wijtschate held 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) . In the south @-@ east , 4 @,@ 800 yards ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) of the front line either side of the river Douve , was defended by the 40th Division . The front @-@ line was lightly held , with fortifications distributed up to 0 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) behind the front line . At the end of May , British artillery fire was so damaging that the 24th and 40th divisions were relieved by the 35th and 3rd Bavarian ( Eingreif ) divisions , which were replaced by the 7th and 1st Guard Reserve divisions in early June and relief of the 2nd Division was promised for 7 / 8 June . 
 The German front line regiments held areas 700 – 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 640 – 1 @,@ 100 m ) wide with one ( Kampf ) battalion forward , one ( <unk> ) battalion in support and the third in reserve 3 – 4 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 – 6 @.@ 4 km ) back . The Kampf battalion usually had three companies in the front system ( which had three lines of breastworks called " Ia " , " Ib " and " Ic " ) and one in the Sonne ( intermediate ) line ( with a company of the support battalion , available for immediate counter @-@ attack ) between the front system and the Höhen ( second ) line on the ridge crest . The other three companies of the support battalion sheltered in the Höhen ( second ) line . About 32 machine @-@ gun posts per regimental sector were dispersed around the defensive zone . The German defence was intended to be mobile and <unk> in " Ic " the third breastwork , were to conduct immediate counter @-@ attacks to recapture " Ia " and " Ib " . If they had to fall back , the support battalions would advance to restore the front system , except at <unk> Hill , which due to its importance was to be held <unk> <unk> ( at all costs ) . 
 On 8 May , the British preliminary bombardment began and on 23 May became much heavier . The breastworks of the front defences were demolished and concrete shelters on both sides of the ridge were systematically destroyed . Air superiority allowed the British artillery observation aircraft to cruise over the German defences , despite the defensive efforts of the Richthofen Circus . On 26 May , the German front garrisons were ordered to move forward 50 yards ( 46 m ) into shell @-@ holes in no @-@ man 's @-@ land at dawn and return to their shelters at night . When the shelters were destroyed , shell @-@ hole positions were made permanent as were those of the companies further back . Troops in the Höhen ( second ) line were withdrawn behind the ridge and by the end of May , the front battalions were being changed every two days instead of every five , due to the effect of the British bombardment . Some German troops on the ridge were convinced of the mine danger and their morale was depressed further by the statement of a prisoner taken on 6 June , that the attack would be synchronised with mine explosions . On 1 June , the British bombardment became more intense and nearly every German defensive position on the forward slope was obliterated . The Luftstreitkräfte effort reached its maximum from 4 – 5 June , when German aircraft observed 74 counter @-@ battery shoots and wireless interception by the British showed 62 German aircraft , escorted by up to seven fighters each , directing artillery fire against the Second Army . British air observation on the reverse slope was less effective than in the foreground but Mesen and Wijtschate villages were demolished , as were much of the Höhen and Sehnen lines , although many pill boxes survived . Long @-@ range fire on Comines , Warneton , <unk> and villages , road junctions , railways and bridges caused much damage and a number of ammunition dumps were destroyed .

 Fine weather was forecast for 4 June , with perhaps a morning haze ( between 15 May – 9 June the weather was fair or fine except for 16 , 17 and 29 May , when it was very bad ) . Zero Day was fixed for 7 June , with zero hour at 3 : 10 a.m. , when it was expected that a man could be seen from the west at 100 yards ( 91 m ) . There was a thunderstorm in the evening of 6 June but by midnight the sky had cleared and at 2 : 00 a.m. , British aircraft cruised over the German lines to camouflage the sound of tanks as they drove to their starting points . By 3 : 00 a.m. , the attacking troops had reached their jumping @-@ off positions unnoticed , except for some in the II Anzac Corps area . Routine British artillery night @-@ firing stopped around half an hour before dawn and birdsong could be heard and at 3 : 10 a.m. the mines began to detonate . After the explosions , the British artillery began to fire at maximum rate . A creeping barrage in three belts 700 yards ( 640 m ) deep began and counter @-@ battery groups bombarded all known German artillery positions with gas shell . The nine attacking divisions and the three in reserve began their advance as the German artillery reply came scattered and late , falling on British assembly trenches after they had been vacated . 
 = = = = First objective ( blue line ) = = = = 
 The II Anzac Corps objective was the southern part of the ridge and Messines village . The 3rd Australian Division on the right , had been disorganised by a German gas bombardment on Ploegsteert ( Plugstreet ) Wood around midnight , which caused 500 casualties during the approach march but the attack between St. Yves and the river Douve began on time . The 9th and 10th Brigades benefitted from four mine explosions at Trenches 122 and 127 , which were seven seconds early and left craters 200 feet ( 61 m ) wide and 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) deep . The craters disrupted the Australian attack formation , some infantry lines merging into a wave before reforming as they advanced . The New Zealand Division approached over Hill 63 and avoided the German gas bombardment . The two attacking brigades crossed the dry river bed of the <unk> and took the German front line , despite the abandonment of the mine at La Petite Douve Farm and then advanced towards Messines village . On the left of the corps , the 25th Division began its advance 600 yards ( 550 m ) further back than the New Zealand Division but quickly caught up , helped by the mine at Ontario Farm . 
 On the right of IX Corps , the 36th ( Ulster ) Division attack on the front of the 107th Brigade , was supported by three mines at <unk> and the big mine at <unk> , 800 yards ( 730 m ) further north . The 109th Brigade on the left was helped by a mine at Peckham House . The devastated area was crossed without resistance , German survivors being stunned by the mine explosions . The 16th ( Irish ) Division attacked between <unk> Farm and the <unk> – Wytschaete road . The mines at <unk> and the two at Petit Bois devastated the defence ; the mines at Petit Bois on the left were about 12 seconds late and knocked over some of the advancing British infantry . On the left of IX Corps , the 19th Division , north of the <unk> – Wytschaete road , attacked with two brigades into the remains of Grand Bois and Bois <unk> . Three mine explosions at <unk> allowed the infantry to take a dangerous salient at Nag 's Nose , as German survivors surrendered or retreated . 
 X Corps had a relatively short advance of 700 yards ( 640 m ) to the crest and another 600 yards ( 550 m ) across the summit , which would uncover the German defences further north on the southern slope of the Gheluvelt plateau and the ground back to Zandvoorde . The German defences had been strengthened and had about double the normal infantry garrison . The German artillery concentration around Zandvoorde made a British attack in the area highly vulnerable but the British counter @-@ battery effort suppressed the German artillery , its replies being late and ragged . On the night of 6 / 7 June , gaps were cut in the British wire to allow the troops to assemble in no @-@ man 's @-@ land , ready to attack at 3 : 10 a.m. The 41st Division attacked with two brigades past a mine under the St. Eloi salient , finding the main obstacle to be wreckage caused by the explosion . The 47th and 23rd divisions formed the left defensive flank of the attack , advancing onto the ridge around the Ypres – Comines canal and railway , past the mines at Caterpillar and Hill 60 . The cuttings of the canal and railway were a warren of German dug @-@ outs but the 47th Division , advancing close up to the creeping barrage , crossed the 300 yards ( 270 m ) of the German front position in 15 minutes , German infantry surrendering along the way . Soft ground in the valley south of Mt . Sorrel , led the two infantry brigades of the 23rd Division to advance on either side up to the near crest of the ridge , arriving while the ground still shook from the mines at Hill 60 . 
 In the areas of the mine explosions , the British infantry found dead , wounded and stunned German soldiers . The attackers swept through the gaps in the German defences as Germans further back hurriedly withdrew . About 80 @,@ 000 British troops advanced up the slope , helped by the creeping bombardment , which threw up lots of smoke and dust , blocking the view of the remaining German defenders . The barrage moved at 100 yards ( 91 m ) in two minutes , which allowed the leading troops to rush or outflank German strong points and machine @-@ gun nests . Where the Germans were able to resist , they were engaged with rifle @-@ grenades , Lewis guns and trench mortars , while riflemen and bombers worked behind them . <unk> fighting tactics had been a great success at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April and in training for the attack at Messines , the same methods were adopted along with emphasis on mopping @-@ up captured ground , to ensure that bypassed German troops could not engage advancing troops from behind . In the smoke and dust , direction was kept by compass and the German forward zone was easily overrun in the 35 minutes allotted , as was the Sonne line , half way to the German Höhen ( second ) line on the ridge . The two supporting battalions of the attacking brigades leap @-@ frogged through , to advance to the second objective on the near crest of the ridge 500 – 800 yards ( 460 – 730 m ) further on . The accuracy of the British barrage was maintained and local German counter @-@ attack attempts were stifled . As the infantry approached the German second line , resistance increased . 
 = = = = Second objective ( black line ) = = = = 
 In the II Anzac Corps area , the 3rd Australian Division consolidated the southern defensive flank of the attack , digging @-@ in astride the river Douve with its right in the new craters at Trench 122 , defeating several hasty German counter @-@ attacks ; the left flank of the division was anchored by a captured German strong @-@ point . The New Zealand Division attacked Messines village , the southern bastion of the German defences on the ridge . The village had been fortified with a line of trenches around the outskirts and an inner defence zone comprising five pillboxes and all the house cellars , which had been converted into shell @-@ proof dug @-@ outs . Two machine @-@ gun posts on the edge of the village were rushed but fire from Swayne 's Farm 400 yards ( 370 m ) north held up the advance , until a tank drove through it and caused 30 German troops to surrender . The New Zealanders penetrated the outer trenches behind the creeping barrage , which slowed to 100 yards ( 91 m ) in 11 minutes ; the German garrison defended the village with great determination , before surrendering when the garrison commander was captured . The 25th Division took the Messines – Wytschaete road on the ridge , north of the New Zealand Division with little opposition except at Hell Farm , which was eventually overrun . 
 In the IX Corps area , the 36th ( Ulster ) Division captured the wreckage of two woods and Bogaert Farm in between , finding that the artillery fire had cut the masses of barbed wire and destroyed many strong @-@ points . Further north , the 16th ( Irish ) and 19th divisions advanced through the remains of Wytschaete wood and Grand Bois , which had been hit by a 2 @,@ 000 oil drum Livens Projector bombardment on the night of 3 / 4 June and by standing barrages on all the known German positions in the woods . A German force at L <unk> held out despite being by @-@ passed , until 6 : 48 a.m. and the objective was reached just after 5 : 00 a.m. 
 German positions at <unk> , which ran from the St. Eloi road to White Château , in the X Corps area , fell to the 41st Division after a long fight . White Château was attacked by the 47th Division as it advanced to the first objective , covered by smoke and <unk> shells fired on the German positions further to the north , along the Comines Canal . The German garrison fought hard and repulsed two attacks , before surrendering after a trench @-@ mortar bombardment at 7 : 50 a.m. The northern defensive flank was maintained by the 23rd Division , with an advance of 300 yards ( 270 m ) in twenty minutes . A German force at the head of the <unk> re @-@ entrant , south of Mt . Sorrel where the two attacking brigades met , held out until forced to surrender by volleys of rifle @-@ grenades . 
 Just after 5 : 00 a.m. all of the British second intermediate objective , the first trench of the German Höhen ( second ) line , on the near crest of the ridge , had been taken . German documents gleaned from the battlefield showed that they expected the forward crest of the ridge to be held until the Eingreif divisions arrived to counter @-@ attack ; the effect of the mines , artillery and British infantry tactics had been underestimated by the German command . The next objective was the rear trench of the German Höhen ( second ) line and the rear crest of the ridge , 400 – 500 yards ( 370 – 460 m ) away . There was a pause of two hours , for fresh battalions to move forward and the captured ground to be consolidated . About 300 yards ( 270 m ) beyond the forward positions , a protective bombardment by 18 @-@ pounders swept back and forth , while the heavier artillery stood ready to respond with SOS barrages . Pack animals and men carrying Yukon packs , brought supplies into the captured ground and engineers supervised the digging and wiring of strong @-@ points . At 7 : 00 a.m. the protective bombardment increased in intensity and began to creep forward again , moving at 100 yards ( 91 m ) in three minutes , as some divisions used battalions from their third brigade and other divisions those that had attacked earlier . Most of the tanks still operational were outstripped but some caught up the infantry . 
 Fresh battalions of the New Zealand Division leap @-@ frogged through those which had attacked earlier and advanced either side of Messines , where some German posts still held out . A German artillery headquarters at <unk> Molen ( blue windmill ) , 500 yards ( 460 m ) beyond Messines , was captured and a tank broke into a strong point at Fanny 's Farm , causing a hundred Germans to surrender . The reserve brigade of the 25th Division continued the advance to the north except at Lumm Farm , which was eventually taken with assistance from the right flank troops of the 36th ( Ulster ) Division . Helped by two tanks , the rest of the 36th ( Ulster ) Division advanced to the right of Wytschaete village and captured a German battalion headquarters . Wytschaete had been fortified like Messines but special bombardments fired on 3 June had demolished the village . Two battalions of the 16th ( Irish ) Division overran the German survivors and on the left , the reserve brigade of the 19th Division took the area from Wytschaete village to Oosttaverne Wood with little resistance . 
 X Corps had greater difficulty reaching some of its final objectives ; the loss of White Château disorganised the German defenders adjacent to the south . The 41st Division easily crossed the summit and reached the rear slope of the ridge 500 yards ( 460 m ) away , which overlooked the eastern slope and <unk> valley , taking many prisoners at Denys and Ravine woods . North of the canal , the 47th Division had to capture a spoil heap 400 yards ( 370 m ) long , where several German machine @-@ gun nests had been dug in . The British attacks established a footing on the heap at great cost , due to machine @-@ gun fire from the spoil heap and others in Battle Wood further north . At 9 : 00 a.m. the infantry withdrew to allow the area to be bombarded from 2 : 30 to 6 : 55 p.m. for an attack by a reserve battalion at 7 : 00 p.m. The 23rd Division had many casualties caused by flanking machine @-@ gun fire from the spoil heap while clearing Battle Wood , which took until the evening . 
 In the centre of the attack , a company from each battalion advanced behind the barrage , to an observation line several hundred yards down the east slope of the ridge , at 8 : 40 a.m. assisted by eight tanks and patrols of cavalry . Most German troops encountered surrendered quickly , except at Leg Copse and Oosttaverne Wood where they offered slight resistance . British aircraft added to German difficulties , with low @-@ level machine @-@ gun attacks . The second objective ( the observation line ) from <unk> Farm to south of Messines , <unk> Farm and Oosttaverne Wood , was reached with few casualties . Ground markers were put out for the three divisions due to attack in the afternoon and the area consolidated . The defensive frontages of the British units on the ridge had been based on an assumption that casualties in the advance to the first intermediate objective ( blue line ) would be 50 percent and in the advance to the ridge ( black line ) would be 60 percent . There were far fewer British casualties than anticipated , which caused congestion on the ridge , where the attacking troops suffered considerable casualties from German long @-@ range machine @-@ gun and artillery fire . The British planners expected that the two German Eingreif divisions behind the ridge , would begin organised counter @-@ attacks at about 11 : 00 a.m. and arranged for a long pause in the advance down the eastern slope , to enable them to be defeated from consolidated defensive positions , rather than encountered in the open while the British were still advancing . The masked batteries of the three reserve divisions were used to add to the protective barrage in front of the infantry but no Germans could be seen . 
 = = = = Final objective ( Oosttaverne line ) = = = = 
 A pause of five hours was considered necessary to defeat the German Eingreif divisions , before resuming the advance on the Oosttaverne ( Sehnen ) line . The pause was extended by two hours to 3 : 10 p.m. , after Plumer received reports on the state of the ground . More artillery joined the masked batteries close to the front line and others moved as far into no @-@ man 's @-@ land as the terrain allowed . On the <unk> of the ridge , 146 machine @-@ guns were prepared , to fire an overhead barrage and each division placed sixteen more guns in the observation line on the eastern slope . The 24 tanks in reserve began to advance at 10 : 30 a.m. to join II Anzac Corps and IX Corps on the flanks . Surviving tanks of the morning attack in X Corps , were to join in from Damm and Denys woods . 
 The 4th Australian Division continued the attack on the II Anzac Corps front , the right hand brigade reaching the assembly areas by 11 : 30 a.m. , before learning of the postponement . The brigade had to lie on open ground under German artillery and machine @-@ gun fire , which caused considerable loss but the left brigade was informed in time to hold back until 1 : 40 p.m. The bombardment began to creep down the slope at 3 : 10 p.m. at a rate of 100 yards ( 91 m ) in three minutes . The right brigade advanced on a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ yard ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) front towards the Oosttaverne line , from the river Douve north to the Blauwepoortbeek ( Blue Gate Brook ) . German machine @-@ gunners in the pillboxes of the Oosttaverne line caused many casualties but with support from three tanks the Australians reached the pillboxes , except for those north of the Messines – Warneton road . As the Australians outflanked the strongpoints , the Germans tried to retreat through the British barrage , which had stopped moving 300 yards ( 270 m ) beyond the rear trench of the Oosttaverne line . The left brigade was stopped on its right flank by fire from the German pillboxes north of the Messines – Warneton road up to the Blauwepoortbeek , 500 yards ( 460 m ) short of the Oosttaverne line , with many casualties . The left battalion , unaware that the 33rd Brigade ( 11th Division ) to the north had been delayed , veered towards the north @-@ east to try to make contact near Lumm Farm , which took the battalion across the <unk> Spur instead of straight down . The objective was easily reached but at the <unk> , 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) north of the intended position . The Australians extended their line further north to Polka <unk> trying to meet the 33rd Brigade , which arrived at 4 : 30 p.m. with four tanks . The brigade took <unk> and Van Hove farms beyond the objective , silencing the machine @-@ guns being fired from them . 
 On the IX Corps front , the 33rd Brigade ( 11th Division ) had been ordered to advance to Vandamme Farm at 9 : 25 a.m. but the message was delayed and the troops did not reach the assembly area at <unk> Farm until 3 : 50 p.m. , half an hour late . To cover the delay , the corps commander ordered the 57th Brigade ( 19th Division ) from reserve , to take the Oosttaverne line from Van Hove Farm to Oosttaverne village then to Bug Wood , so that only the southern 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) were left for the 33rd Brigade . These orders were also delayed and the 19th Division commander asked for a postponement , then ordered the 57th Brigade to advance without waiting for the 33rd Brigade . The troops only knew that they were to advance downhill and keep up to the barrage but were able to occupy the objective in 20 minutes against light opposition , meeting the Australians at Polka <unk> . 
 Two brigades of the 24th Division in Corps reserve , advanced into the X Corps sector and reached <unk> on time . The brigades easily reached their objectives around Bug Wood , Rose Wood and <unk> Farm , taking unopposed many German pillboxes . The brigades captured 289 Germans and six field guns for a loss of six casualties , advancing 800 yards ( 730 m ) along the <unk> valley , then took Ravine Wood unopposed on the left flank . The left battalion was drawn back to meet the 47th Division , which was still held up by machine @-@ gun fire from the spoil bank . The final objectives of the British offensive had been taken , except for the area of the Ypres – Comines canal near the spoil bank and 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) of the Oosttaverne line , at the junction of the II Anzac Corps and IX Corps . Despite a heavy bombardment until 6 : 55 p.m. , the Germans at the spoil bank repulsed another infantry attack . The reserve battalion which had been moved up for the second attack on the spoil bank , had been caught in a German artillery bombardment while assembling for the attack . The companies which attacked then met with massed machine @-@ gun fire during the advance and only advanced half @-@ way to the spoil bank . The 207 survivors of the original 301 infantry , were withdrawn when German reinforcements were seen arriving from the canal cutting and no further attempts were made . 
 The situation near the Blauwepoortbeek worsened , when German troops were seen assembling near <unk> Farm , close to the Warneton road . A British SOS barrage fell on the 12th Australian Brigade , which was inadvertently digging @-@ in 250 yards ( 230 m ) beyond its objective . The Australians stopped the German counter @-@ attack with small @-@ arms fire but many survivors began to withdraw spontaneously , until they stopped in relative safety on the ridge . As darkness fell and being under the impression that all the Australians had retired , New Zealand artillery observers called for the barrage to be brought closer to the observation line , when they feared a German counter @-@ attack . The bombardment fell on the rest of the Australians , who withdrew with many casualties , leaving the southern part of the Oosttaverne line unoccupied , as well as the gap around the Blauwepoortbeek . An SOS barrage on the IX Corps front stopped a German counter @-@ attack from the <unk> valley but many shells fell short , precipitating another informal withdrawal . Rumour led to the barrage being moved closer to the observation line , which added to British casualties until 10 : 00 p.m. , when the infantry managed to get the artillery stopped and were then able to re @-@ occupy the positions . Operations to re @-@ take the Oosttaverne line in the II Anzac Corps area started at 3 : 00 a.m. on 8 June . 
 = = = Air operations = = = 
 As the infantry moved to the attack contact @-@ patrol aircraft flew low overhead , two being maintained over each corps during the day . The observers were easily able to plot the positions of experienced troops , who lit flares and waved anything to attract attention . Some troops , poorly trained and inexperienced , failed to co @-@ operate , fearing exposure to the Germans so aircraft flew dangerously low to identify them , four being shot down in consequence . Although air observation was not as vital to German operations because of their control of commanding ground , the speed by which reports from air observation could be delivered , made it a most valuable form of liaison between the front line and higher commanders . German infantry proved as reluctant to reveal themselves as the British so German flyers also had to make visual identifications . Reports and maps were dropped at divisional headquarters and corps report centres , allowing the progress of the infantry to be followed . During the pause on the ridge crest , an observer reported that the Oosttaverne line was barely occupied , at 2 : 00 p.m. a balloon observer reported a heavy German barrage on the II Anzac Corps front and a counter @-@ attack patrol aircraft reported German infantry advancing either side of Messines . The German counter @-@ attack was " crushed " by artillery fire by 2 : 30 p.m. Each corps squadron kept an aircraft on counter @-@ attack patrol all day , to call for barrage fire if German troops were seen in the open but the speed of the British advance resulted in few German counter @-@ attacks . Artillery observers watched for German gunfire and made 398 zone calls but only 165 managed to have German guns engaged . The observers regulated the bombardment of the Oosttaverne line and the artillery of VIII Corps to the north of the attack , which was able to enfilade German artillery opposite X Corps . 
 Fourteen fighters were sent to strafe from low altitude , German ground targets ahead of the British infantry , roving behind German lines , attacking infantry , transport , gun @-@ teams and machine @-@ gun nests ; the attacks continued all day , with two of the British aircraft being shot down . Organised attacks were made on the German airfields at <unk> and <unk> near Courtrai and the day bombing squadrons attacked airfields at <unk> Chin , <unk> , <unk> ( again ) and <unk> . Reconnaissance reports of German troops concentrating from Quesnoy – Warneton , led to aircraft setting out to attack them within minutes . German fighters made a considerable effort to intercept corps observation aircraft over the battlefield but were frustrated by patrols on the barrage line and offensive patrols beyond ; only one British corps aircraft was shot down by German aircraft during the day . After dark , the night @-@ bombing specialists of 100 Squadron bombed railway stations at Warneton , Menin and Courtrai . Ignorance of the situation at the northern end of the II Anzac Corps <unk> was resolved by air reconnaissance at dawn on 8 June .

 At 2 : 50 a.m. on 7 June , the British artillery bombardment ceased ; expecting an immediate infantry assault , the German defenders returned to their forward positions . At 3 : 10 a.m. the mines were detonated , killing c . 10 @,@ 000 German soldiers and destroying most of the middle breastwork Ib of the front system , paralysing the survivors of the eleven German battalions in the front line , who were swiftly overrun . The explosions occurred while some of the German front line troops were being relieved , catching both groups in the blasts and British artillery fire resumed at the same moment as the explosions . Some of the <unk> ( <unk> ) in breastwork Ic were able to counter @-@ attack but were overwhelmed quickly , as the British advanced on the Sonne line , which usually held half of the support battalions but had been reduced to about 100 men and six machine @-@ guns , in each 800 yards ( 730 m ) regimental zone . Smoke and dust from the British barrage limited visibility to 100 yards ( 91 m ) and some defenders thought that figures moving towards them were German soldiers , retreating <unk> and were also overrun . After a pause , the British continued to the Höhen line , held by half of the support battalions , a company of each reserve battalion and 10 – 12 machine @-@ guns per regimental sector . Despite daylight , German defenders only saw occasional shapes in the dust and smoke , as they were deluged by artillery fire and machine @-@ gunned by swarms of British aircraft . The German defence in the south collapsed and uncovered the left flank of each unit further north in turn , forcing them to retire to the Sehnen ( Oosttaverne ) line . Some German units held out in Wijtschate and near St. Eloi , waiting to be relieved by counter @-@ attacks which never came . The garrison of the <unk> ( Caterpillar or spoil heap to the British ) held on for 36 hours until relieved . 
 Laffert had expected that the two Eingreif divisions behind Messines Ridge , would reach the Höhen ( second ) line before the British . The divisions had reached assembly areas near Gheluvelt and Warneton by 7 : 00 a.m. and the 7th Division was ordered to move from Zandvoorde to Hollebeke , to attack across the Comines canal , towards Wijtschate into the British northern flank . The 1st Guard Reserve Division was to move to the Warneton line east of Messines , then advance around Messines to recapture the original front system . Both Eingreif divisions were plagued by delays , being new to the area and untrained for counter @-@ attack operations . The 7th Division was shelled by British artillery all the way to the Comines canal , then part of the division was diverted to reinforce the remnants of the front divisions holding positions around Hollebeke . The rest of the division found that the British had already taken the Sehnen ( Oosttaverne ) line , by the time that they arrived at 4 : 00 p.m. The 1st Guard Reserve Division was also bombarded as it crossed the Warneton ( third ) line but reached the area east of Messines by 3 : 00 p.m. , only to be devastated by the resumption of the British creeping barrage and forced back to the Sehnen ( Oosttaverne ) line , as the British began to advance to their next objective . Laffert contemplated a further withdrawal , then ordered the existing line to be held after the British advance stopped . Most of the losses inflicted on the British infantry by the German defence came from German artillery fire . In the days after the main attack , German shellfire on the new British lines was extremely accurate and well @-@ timed , inflicting 90 percent of the casualties suffered by the 25th Division .

 = = = Analysis = = = 
 Military analysts and historians disagree on the strategic significance of the battle , although most describe it as a British tactical and operational success . In 1919 , Ludendorff wrote that the British victory cost the German army dear and drained German reserves . Hindenburg wrote that the losses at Messines had been very heavy and that he regretted that the ground had not been evacuated ; in 1922 , Kuhl called it one of the worst German tragedies of the war . In 1920 Haig 's Dispatches described the success of the British plan , organisation and results but refrained from hyperbole , referring to the operation as a successful preliminary to the main offensive at Ypres . In 1930 , Liddell Hart thought the success at Messines inflated expectations for the Third Battle of Ypres and that because the circumstances of the operations were different , attempts to apply similar tactics resulted in failure . In 1938 Lloyd George called the battle an apéritif and in 1939 , G. C. Wynne judged it to be a " brilliant success " , overshadowed by the subsequent tragedy of the Battles of Passchendaele . The Official Historian called it a " great victory " in 1948 and Prior and Wilson ( 1997 ) called the battle a " noteworthy success " but then complained about the decision to postpone exploitation of the success on the Gheluvelt plateau . Ashley Ekins referred to the battle as a great set @-@ piece victory , which was also costly , particularly for the infantry of II Anzac Corps , as did Christopher Pugsley , referring to the experience of the New Zealand Division . Heinz <unk> called it a great British success and wrote that the loss of the ridge , had a worse effect on German morale than the number of casualties . Jack Sheldon called it a " significant victory " for the British and a " disaster " for the German army , which was forced into a " lengthy period of anxious waiting " . Brown in 1996 and Simpson in 2001 concluded that extending British supply routes over the ridge , which had been devastated by the mines and millions of shells , to consolidate the Oosttaverne line and completion of the infrastructure further north in the Fifth Army area , was necessary before the " Northern Operation " ( the Third Battle of Ypres ) could begin and was the main reason for the operational pause in June and July .

In 2007 Sheldon gave 22 @,@ 988 casualties for the German 4th Army from 1 – 10 June 1917 . 
 = = = Subsequent operations = = = 
 At 3 : 00 a.m. on 8 June , the British attack to regain the Oosttaverne line from the river Douve to the Warneton road found few German garrisons as it was occupied . German artillery south of the Lys , heavily bombarded the southern slopes of the ridge and caused considerable losses among Anzac troops pinned there . Ignorance of the situation north of the Warneton road continued ; a reserve battalion was sent to reinforce the 49th Australian Battalion near the Blauwepoortbeek for the 3 : 00 a.m. attack , which did not take place . The 4th Australian Division commander , Major @-@ General William Holmes , went forward at 4 : 00 a.m. and finally clarified the situation . New orders instructed the 33rd Brigade ( 11th Division ) to side @-@ step to the right and relieve the 52nd Australian Battalion , which at dusk would move to the south and join the 49th Australian Battalion for the attack into the gap at the Blauwepoortbeek . All went well until observers on the ridge saw the 52nd Australian Battalion withdrawing , mistook it for a German counter @-@ attack and called for an SOS bombardment . German observers in the valley saw troops from the 33rd Brigade moving into the area to relieve the Australian battalion , mistook them for an attacking force and also called for an SOS bombardment . The area was deluged with artillery fire from both sides for two hours , causing many casualties and the attack was postponed until 9 June . 
 Confusion had been caused by the original attacking divisions on the ridge , having control over the artillery which covered the area occupied by the reserve divisions down the eastern slope . The arrangement had been intended to protect the ridge from large German counter @-@ attacks , which might force the reserve divisions back up the slope . The mistaken bombardments of friendly troops ended late on 9 June , when the New Zealand , 16th ( Irish ) and 36th ( Ulster ) divisions were withdrawn into reserve and the normal corps organisation was restored ; anticipated large German counter @-@ attacks had not occurred . On 10 June , the attack down the Blauwepoortbeek began but met strong resistance from the fresh German 11th Division , brought in from Group Ypres . The 3rd Australian Division advanced 600 yards ( 550 m ) either side the river Douve , consolidating their hold on a rise around Thatched Cottage , which secured the right flank of the new Messines position ; early on 11 June , the Germans evacuated the Blauwepoortbeek sector . British observation from the Oosttaverne line proved to be poor , which led Plumer to order a further advance down the slope . On 14 June , the II Anzac Corps was to push forward on the right from Plugstreet Wood to Trois Tilleuls Farm and Hill 20 and another 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) to the <unk> spur and Ferme de la Croix . IX Corps was to take <unk> Farm , the <unk> hamlet and come level with the Australians at Delporte Farm ; X Corps was to capture the Spoil Bank and the areas adjacent . The attack was forestalled by a German retirement on the night of 10 / 11 June and by 14 June , British advanced posts had been established without resistance . 
 Meticulously planned and well executed , the assault secured its objectives in fewer than twelve hours . The combination of tactics devised on the Somme and at Arras , the use of mines , artillery survey , creeping barrages , tanks , aircraft and small @-@ unit fire @-@ and @-@ movement tactics , created a measure of surprise and allowed the attacking infantry to advance by infiltration when confronted by intact defences . Well @-@ organised mopping @-@ up parties prevented by @-@ passed German troops from firing on advanced troops from behind . The British took 7 @,@ 354 prisoners , 48 guns , 218 machine @-@ guns and 60 trench mortars . The offensive secured the southern end of the Ypres salient in preparation for the British " Northern Operation " . Laffert , commander of Gruppe Wijtschate , was sacked two days after the battle . 
 Haig had discussed the possibility of rapid exploitation of a victory at Messines with Plumer before the attack , arranging for II and VIII Corps to advance either side of Bellewaarde Lake , using some of the artillery from the Messines front , which Plumer considered would take three days to transfer . On 8 June , patrols on the II and VIII Corps fronts reported strong resistance , Haig urged Plumer to attack immediately and Plumer replied that it would still take three days to arrange . Haig transferred the two corps to the Fifth Army and that evening , gave instructions to Gough to plan the preliminary operation to capture the area around Stirling Castle . On 14 June , Gough announced that the operation would put his troops into a salient and that he wanted to take the area as part of the main offensive . On 13 June , German aircraft began daylight attacks on London and the south @-@ east of England , leading to the diversion of British aircraft from the concentration of air forces for the " Northern Operation " .

 = Stella Nickell = 
 Stella Nickell ( born August 7 , 1943 ) is an American woman who was sentenced to 90 years in prison for product tampering after she poisoned Excedrin capsules with lethal cyanide , resulting in the deaths of her husband , Bruce , and Susan Snow . Her May 1988 conviction and prison sentence were the first under federal product tampering laws instituted after the Chicago Tylenol murders . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Stella Nickell was born Stella <unk> Stephenson in Colton , Oregon , to Alva Georgia " Jo " ( née Duncan ; later changed her name to Cora Lee ) and George Stephenson , and grew up poor . By age sixteen , she was pregnant with her daughter Cynthia . Nickell then moved to Southern California , married , and had another daughter . She began to have various legal troubles , including a conviction for fraud in 1968 , a charge the following year of beating Cynthia with a curtain rod , and a conviction for forgery in 1971 . She served six months in jail for the fraud charge , and was ordered into counseling after the abuse charge . 
 Stella met Bruce Nickell in 1974 . Nickell was a heavy equipment operator with a drinking habit , which suited Stella 's lifestyle , and the two were married in 1976 . In the course of their ten @-@ year marriage , Bruce Nickell entered rehab and gave up drinking . Reportedly , Stella resented this . Her bar visits were curtailed by Bruce 's sobriety , and Stella cultivated a home aquarium as a new hobby . 
 = = Deaths = = 
 On June 5 , 1986 , the couple was living in Auburn , Washington when Bruce Nickell , 52 , came home from work with a headache . According to Stella , Nickell took four Extra @-@ Strength Excedrin capsules from a bottle in their home for his headache and collapsed minutes later . Nickell died shortly thereafter at Harborview Medical Center , where treatment had failed to revive him . His death was initially ruled to be by natural causes , with attending physicians citing emphysema . 
 A second death , less than a week later , forced authorities to reconsider the cause of Nickell 's death . On June 11 , Susan Snow , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old Auburn bank manager , took two Extra @-@ Strength Excedrin capsules for an early @-@ morning headache . Snow 's husband , Paul Webking , took two capsules from the same bottle for his arthritis and left the house for work . At 6 : 30 am , the Snows ' fifteen @-@ year @-@ old daughter found Susan Snow collapsed on the floor of her bathroom , unresponsive and with a faint pulse . Paramedics were called and transported Snow to Harborview Medical Center , but she died later the same day without regaining consciousness . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 = = = Initial investigation = = = 
 During an autopsy on Susan Snow , Assistant Medical Examiner Janet Miller detected the scent of bitter almonds , an odor distinctive to cyanide . Tests verified that Snow had died of acute cyanide poisoning . Investigators examined the contents of the Snow @-@ Webking household and discovered the source of the cyanide : the bottle of Extra @-@ Strength Excedrin capsules that both Snow and Webking had used the morning of Snow 's death . Three capsules out of those that remained in the 60 @-@ capsule bottle were found to be laced with cyanide in toxic quantities . 
 A murder by cyanide was sensational news in Washington . When another tainted bottle from the same lot was found in a grocery store in nearby Kent , Washington , the manufacturers of Excedrin , Bristol @-@ Myers , responded to the discovery with a heavily @-@ publicized recall of all Extra @-@ Strength Excedrin products in the Seattle , Washington area , and a group of drug companies came together to offer a $ 300 @,@ 000 reward for the capture of the person responsible . 
 In response to the publicity , Stella Nickell came forward on June 19 . She told police that her husband had recently died suddenly , after taking pills from a 40 @-@ capsule bottle of Extra @-@ Strength Excedrin with the same lot number as the one that had killed Susan Snow . Tests by the FDA confirmed the presence of cyanide in Bruce Nickell 's remains and in two Excedrin bottles Stella Nickell had turned over to police . 
 Initial suspicions were directed at the manufacturers of the Excedrin capsules . Both Paul Webking and Stella Nickell filed wrongful death lawsuits against Bristol @-@ Myers , and the FDA inspected the Morrisville , North Carolina plant where Extra @-@ Strength Excedrin lot <unk> had been packaged , but found no traces of cyanide to explain its presence in the Washington bottles . On June 18 , Bristol @-@ Myers recalled all Excedrin capsules in the United States , pulling them from store shelves and warning consumers to not use any they may already have bought ; two days later the company announced a recall of all of their non @-@ prescription capsule products . On June 24 , a cyanide @-@ contaminated bottle of Extra @-@ Strength <unk> @-@ 3 was found at the same store where Susan Snow had bought her contaminated Excedrin . On June 27 , Washington State put into an effect a 90 @-@ day ban on the sale of non @-@ prescription medication in capsules . 
 Examination of the contaminated bottles by the FBI Crime Lab found that , in addition to containing cyanide powder , the poisoned capsules also contained flecks of an unknown green substance . Further tests showed that the substance was an <unk> used in home aquariums , sold under the brand name Algae Destroyer . 
 = = = Focusing the investigation = = = 
 With contamination of the Excedrin at the source having been ruled out , investigators began to focus their investigation on the end @-@ users of the product . The FBI began an investigation into possible product tampering having been the source of the poison . At the time , Excedrin was packaged in plastic bottles with the mouth of the bottle sealed with foil and the lid secured to the bottle with plastic wrap . 
 Both Paul Webking and Stella Nickell were asked to take polygraph examinations . Webking did so , though he complained in subsequent press about his treatment by the FBI . Nickell declined to take a polygraph exam through the lawyer representing her in the wrongful @-@ death suit she had filed , who told reporters that she was too " shaken up " to be subjected to the examination . 
 Investigators ' suspicions began to turn to Stella Nickell when they discovered that she claimed that the two contaminated Excedrin bottles that she had turned over to police had been purchased at different times and different locations . A total of five bottles had been found to be contaminated in the entire country , and it was regarded as suspicious that Nickell would happen to have acquired two of them purely by chance . 
 With investigatory focus turned to Stella Nickell , detectives uncovered more circumstantial evidence pointing to her as the culprit . Nickell had taken out a total of about $ 76 @,@ 000 in insurance coverage on her husband 's life , with an additional payout of $ 100 @,@ 000 if his death was accidental . She was also known to have , even before Susan Snow 's death , repeatedly disputed doctors ' ruling that her husband had died of natural causes . Further FBI investigation showed that Bruce Nickell 's purported signatures on at least two of the insurance policies in his name had been forged . 
 Investigators were also able to verify that Nickell had purchased Algae Destroyer from a local fish store ; it was speculated that the <unk> had become mixed with the cyanide when Nickell used the same container to crush both substances without washing it in between uses . 
 Nickell finally consented to a polygraph examination in November 1986 . She failed it and investigators narrowed their focus to her even further ; however , concrete evidence proving that Nickell had ever purchased or used cyanide was lacking , and despite their relative certainty that Stella Nickell had orchestrated the poisonings as either an elaborate cover @-@ up for an insurance @-@ motivated murder of her husband , or as a desperate attempt to force her husband 's death to be ruled an accident , to increase her insurance payout , they were unable to build a strong enough case to support an arrest . 
 = = = Breaking the case = = = 
 In January 1987 , Stella Nickell 's adult daughter , Cynthia Hamilton , approached police with information : Nickell had spoken to her daughter repeatedly about wanting her husband dead . He was a bore , Nickell said , who after having gotten sober , preferred to stay home and watch television rather than go out to bars . Nickell , Hamilton claimed , had even told her that she had tried to poison Bruce previously with foxglove . When that failed , she had begun library research into other methods and hit upon cyanide . Cynthia also claimed that Nickell had spoken to her about what the two of them could do with the insurance money if Bruce Nickell were dead . 
 Records from the Auburn Public Library , when subpoenaed , showed that Nickell had checked out numerous books about poisons , including Human Poisonings from Native and Cultivated Plants and Deadly Harvest . The former was marked as overdue in library records , indicating that Nickell had borrowed but never returned it . The FBI identified Nickell 's fingerprints on cyanide @-@ related pages of a number of the works she had checked out from the library in this period . 
 By the summer of 1987 , even Nickell 's attorneys acknowledged that she was the prime suspect in the case . 
 = = Arrest and trial = = 
 On December 9 , 1987 , Stella Nickell was indicted by a federal grand jury on five counts of product tampering , including two which resulted in the deaths of Susan Snow and Bruce Nickell , and arrested the same day . She went on trial in April , 1988 and was found guilty of all charges on May 9 , after five days of jury deliberation . 
 Despite Nickell 's legal team 's claims of jury @-@ tampering and judicial misconduct having occurred , a motion for a mistrial was denied and Nickell was sentenced to two ninety @-@ year terms for the charges relating to the deaths of Snow and Bruce Nickell , and three ten @-@ year terms for the other product tampering charges . All sentences were to run concurrently , and the judge ordered Nickell to pay a small fine and forfeit her remaining assets to the families of her victims . 
 Nickell will be eligible for parole in 2018 , when she will be 75 years old .

 Nickell continued to maintain her innocence after her trial . An appeal based on jury @-@ tampering and judicial misconduct issues was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August 1989 . A second appeal , beginning in 2001 with the assistance of Innocence Project and private detectives Al Farr and Paul <unk> , requested a new trial on the basis of new evidence having been discovered that the FBI may have withheld documents from the defense . The appeal was denied , though Nickell and her team continue to assert her innocence . She claims that her daughter Cynthia lied about Nickell 's involvement in the case in order to reap the $ 300 @,@ 000 of reward money being offered . Cynthia Hamilton eventually collected $ 250 @,@ 000 of that money . Nickell also alleges that the testimony of various smaller cogs in the case , such as the store owner who testified about her having purchased Algae Destroyer , was influenced by promises of payment . 
 = = FDA regulations = = 
 After the 1982 Tylenol murders , FDA regulations went into effect which made it a federal - rather than just a state or local - crime to tamper with consumer products . Local and state authorities are not , however , prevented from also filing charges in such cases . Under this law , Nickell 's crime was prosecutable as a federal product tampering case as well as a state murder case , and she was convicted not of murder , but of product tampering that caused death . The possibility of state charges for the actual murders of Susan Snow and Bruce Nickell continues to exist .

 A 2000 made @-@ for @-@ TV film was to be made about the Stella Nickell case , but it was cancelled shortly before production began based on strong objections from advertisers , including Johnson & Johnson , owner of the Tylenol brand of painkillers , which had featured in the Chicago Tylenol murders , a prior product @-@ tampering case . The film was to have aired on USA Network , directed by Jeff Reiner and starring Katey <unk> . 
 Seattle author Gregg Olsen wrote about the Nickell case in his book , Bitter Almonds : The True Story of Mothers , Daughters and the Seattle Cyanide Murders . The case was also featured on episodes of HBO Autopsy , Forensic Files , The New Detectives , and Snapped , as well as two episodes of Deadly Women . 
 Nickell 's murders are discussed in the Jodi <unk> novel House Rules . 
 = Admiral @-@ class battlecruiser = 
 The Admiral @-@ class battlecruisers were to have been a class of four British Royal Navy battlecruisers designed near the end of World War I. Their design began as an improved version of the Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships , but it was recast as a battlecruiser after Admiral John Jellicoe , commander of the Grand Fleet , pointed out that there was no real need for more battleships , but that a number of German battlecruisers had been laid down that were superior to the bulk of the Grand Fleet 's battlecruisers and the design was revised to counter these . The class was to have consisted of HMS Hood , Anson , Howe , and Rodney — all names of famous admirals — but the latter three ships were suspended as the material and labour required to complete them was needed for higher @-@ priority merchantmen and escort vessels . Their designs were updated to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland , but the Admiralty eventually decided that it was better to begin again with a clean @-@ slate design so they were cancelled in 1919 . No more battlecruisers would be built due to the arms limitations agreements of the interbellum . 
 Hood , however , was sufficiently advanced in construction that she was completed in 1920 and immediately became flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet . She served as the flagship of the Special Service Squadron during its round @-@ the @-@ world cruise in 1923 @-@ 24 . Hood was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936 and spent much of the next few years on Non @-@ Intervention Patrols during the Spanish Civil War , returning to the United Kingdom before the beginning of World War II and the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet . 
 Hood spent most of the early part of the war patrolling against German commerce raiders and escorting convoys . Flagship of Force H , based at Gibraltar , she bombarded French ships during the attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir . In May 1941 Hood and the battleship Prince of Wales were ordered to intercept the German battleship Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen as they attempted to break out into the North Atlantic . In the subsequent Battle of the Denmark Strait , the aft magazines of Hood exploded , sinking her within five minutes of opening fire . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 In 1915 the Admiralty was considering the next generation of warship to follow the Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships . The Director of Naval Construction ( DNC ) , Sir Eustace Tennyson @-@ d 'Eyncourt , was given instructions to prepare designs for a new battleship . The design should : " take the armament , armour and engine power of Queen Elizabeth as the standard and build around them a hull which should draw as little water as was considered practicable and safe , and which should embody all the latest protection and improvements against underwater attack . " The design ( ' A ' ) was submitted to the Admiralty on 30 November for consideration . The DNC had been able to reduce the draught in comparison to Queen Elizabeth by 22 % by widening the ship to 104 feet ( 31 @.@ 7 m ) and lengthening it to 810 feet ( 246 @.@ 9 m ) ; this had the consequence of restricting the ships to use only one dock in Rosyth and two in Portsmouth . Large anti @-@ torpedo bulges were fitted , and the secondary armament of twelve 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) guns of a new design was mounted on the forecastle deck . The resulting high freeboard gave the design a greater ratio of reserve buoyancy to displacement than in any previous British dreadnought . The design 's stretched hull form also gave her an estimated speed of 26 @.@ 5 knots ( 49 @.@ 1 km / h ; 30 @.@ 5 mph ) , about 2 @.@ 5 knots ( 4 @.@ 6 km / h ; 2 @.@ 9 mph ) faster than Queen Elizabeth had been able to reach in service . The First Sea Lord , Admiral Sir Henry Jackson , responded on 6 December that one danger of such a large ship would be start a new arms race with the Americans that Britain could ill @-@ afford , and that better deck protection was necessary to defeat plunging shells during long @-@ range engagements . 
 The Admiralty asked for the design to be reworked ( ' B ' ) with a maximum beam of 90 feet ( 27 @.@ 4 m ) , but this was deemed unsatisfactory as it compromised the ship 's underwater protection . A pair of revised designs was requested with the speed reduced to 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) to allow the hull to be shortened to better fit in existing floating docks and the minimum possible draught . The first of the two ( ' C1 ' ) was to have full bulge protection and the second ( ' C2 ' ) to have the best bulge protection possible without exceeding Queen Elizabeth 's length . ' C1 ' was shortened by 100 feet ( 30 @.@ 5 m ) in comparison with ' B ' and ' C2 ' was only 610 feet ( 185 @.@ 9 m ) in length , but draught increased by 1 foot 3 inches ( 0 @.@ 38 m ) . In both proposals it had been necessary to reduce the number of guns in the secondary armament and reduce the thickness of the armour . The Admiralty was not pleased with either design and asked for a revised version of ' A ' of the same draught , beam , armour and armament , but shortened and with the same speed as Queen Elizabeth . In addition the new five @-@ inch gun was rejected in favour of the existing 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 140 mm ) gun . 
 At least some of the designs were passed to Admiral John Jellicoe , commander of the Grand Fleet , who pointed out that there was no need for new battleships as the British superiority in numbers over the Germans was substantial , but that was not true for battlecruisers . Germany was known to be building three new Mackensen @-@ class battlecruisers with an estimated speed approaching 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) and a reported armament of 15 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 386 mm ) guns . These ships would be superior to all existing British battlecruisers , and those then under construction ( the two Renown @-@ class and the three Courageous @-@ class ' large light cruisers ' ) were equally fast , but too thinly armoured to compete with them . He also remarked that his experience with Queen Elizabeth @-@ class had persuaded him that an intermediate speed between the battleships and the battlecruisers was of little use ; he suggested that the design should be for either a 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) battleship or a thirty @-@ knot battlecruiser , preferably the latter . 
 The DNC prepared two new designs in response to Admiral Jellicoe 's comments on 1 February 1916 , each for a battlecruiser capable of thirty knots or better and armed with eight 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) guns . Design ' 1' displaced 39 @,@ 000 long tons ( 39 @,@ 626 t ) with two less inches in belt armour and a speed of thirty knots . It used the bulky large @-@ tube boilers traditional in British capital ships , which explains why the design was 9 @,@ 000 long tons ( 9 @,@ 144 t ) larger than any of the previous battleship designs . Design ' 2' was essentially a repeat of the first design except that small @-@ tube boilers were substituted . These were considerably smaller than the older type and saved 3 @,@ 500 long tons ( 3 @,@ 556 t ) over Design ' 1' and had one less foot of draught . These savings were substantial enough to overcome the Engineer @-@ in @-@ Chief 's objections that they required more frequent and expensive repairs . The DNC was asked to submit four more designs using small @-@ tube boilers which were submitted on 17 February . Design ' 3' was Design ' 2' with the machinery power increased to 160 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 120 @,@ 000 kW ) to boost the maximum speed to 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) while the other designs had either four , six or eight 18 @-@ inch ( 457 mm ) guns . Design ' 3' was selected as Admiral Jellicoe has specified that the minimum number of guns should be no less than eight as fewer caused problems in accurate fire control , and two alternatives were to be provided , one with a dozen 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns and the other with sixteen such guns . The latter proposal was selected on 7 April and orders were placed on 19 April for three ships ( Hood , Howe and Rodney ) . The order for the fourth ship , Anson , was placed on 13 June . 
 Hood was laid down on 31 May 1916 , the same day as the Battle of Jutland . The loss of three British battlecruisers during that battle caused the work on all three ships to be suspended pending an investigation into possible design flaws . Admiral Jellicoe 's investigation blamed the loss of the ships on faulty cordite handling procedures that allowed fires in the turrets or hoists to reach the ships ' magazines . It recommended anti @-@ flash equipment be installed in magazines and handling rooms and the improvement of deck armour over the magazines to prevent plunging shells or fragments from reaching the magazines . The DNC and the Third Sea Lord opposed the latter , believing that there was no direct evidence that the magazines had been directly penetrated . 
 On 5 July the DNC submitted two revised designs for the Admiral @-@ class ships . The first was a modification of the previous design with slight increases to the deck , turret , barbette , and funnel uptake armour , one @-@ inch protection for the 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ammunition hatches and hoists , and the number of electrical generators increased from four to eight . These changes increased the displacement by 1 @,@ 250 long tons ( 1 @,@ 270 t ) and draught by 9 inches ( 228 @.@ 6 mm ) . The second design drastically improved the protection and converted the ships into fast battleships . The vertical armour was generally increased by 50 % and the deck protection was slightly thickened as in the first design . These changes would have added another 4 @,@ 300 long tons ( 4 @,@ 369 t ) to the original design and increased the draught by 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) , but would have cost half a knot in speed . This design would have been equal to the Queen Elizabeths , but 7 knots ( 13 km / h ; 8 @.@ 1 mph ) faster and with much improved torpedo protection , although it was some 13 @,@ 000 long tons ( 13 @,@ 209 t ) larger than the older ships . After the DNC submitted the above designs , he was asked to consider variations with triple fifteen @-@ inch turrets , and these were submitted on 20 July . The Admiralty chose the fast battleship design , and Hood was laid down again on 1 September . 
 Later that month Hood 's armour scheme was slightly revised in light of further analysis of the results of Jutland and the deck armour was modestly increased in order to ensure that a minimum thickness of nine inches of armour would have to be penetrated by shells striking at angles of descent up to 30 ° from the horizontal . Further alterations were made in 1917 during her construction that increased the thickness of her turret faces and roofs . These changes , plus numerous others , increased her displacement by 600 long tons ( 610 t ) , her draught by 3 inches ( 76 @.@ 2 mm ) and reduced her speed to 31 knots ( 57 km / h ; 36 mph ) . The changes continued during 1918 when the thickness of her magazine crowns was increased from one inch to two ; the armour for the funnel uptakes above the forecastle deck was omitted in compensation . In May 1919 her main deck armour at the side abreast the magazines was increased to three inches ( 76 mm ) , and four 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns and their ammunition were deleted in consequence . The next month plans were approved to increase the thickness of the main deck over the forward magazines to 5 inches ( 127 mm ) and to 6 inches ( 152 mm ) over the rear magazines ; her four above water torpedo tubes and their protection were to be omitted and the wall of the torpedo control tower were to be reduced to a thickness of 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 @.@ 1 mm ) to offset the armour 's weight . However , the additional deck armour was never fitted and the torpedo tubes ( less their protection ) were retained . 
 Earlier in 1917 , however , construction of Hood 's three sisters had been suspended as the amount of labour and material they required would be better employed in the construction and repair of merchant ships and escorts needed to keep open Britain 's lines of communication in the face of the U @-@ boat blockade . Design work continued however , although Hood was too far advanced to incorporate these changes , and ultimately would have been extensive enough for the other three ships to constitute their own class . At the end of 1917 the suspended ships ' design was modified to increase the thickness of the turret roofs to six inches ( 152 mm ) , and ( unspecified ) alterations were made to the armoured bulkheads . These cost a total of 267 long tons ( 271 t ) in displacement . Other changes were a redesigned bridge structure and moving the funnels closer together and the exchange in position between the fifteen @-@ inch <unk> and magazines . This latter change would have caused the hull 's form to be filled out somewhat to accommodate the handling room of the rearmost turret at the cost of a slight loss in speed and ammunition storage . 
 Hood was the closest to completion and her construction was continued in case the Germans managed to complete any of their new battlecruisers . Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hood 's construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted , but the War Cabinet refused to approve either measure as nothing could be sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to this end . After the end of the war the three suspended ships were cancelled as they could not fully incorporate the lessons of the war . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Admiral @-@ class ships were significantly larger than their predecessors of the Renown class . They had an overall length of 860 feet ( 262 @.@ 1 m ) , a beam of 104 feet ( 31 @.@ 7 m ) , and a draught of 31 feet 6 inches ( 9 @.@ 6 m ) at deep load . This was 110 feet ( 33 @.@ 5 m ) longer and 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) wider than the smaller ships . They displaced 41 @,@ 200 long tons ( 41 @,@ 861 t ) at load and 45 @,@ 620 long tons ( 46 @,@ 352 t ) at deep load , over 13 @,@ 000 long tons ( 13 @,@ 210 t ) more than the older ships . They had a metacentric height of 4 @.@ 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) at deep load as well as a complete double bottom . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The ships had four Brown @-@ Curtis single @-@ reduction geared steam turbine sets , each of which drove one propeller shaft . They were arranged in three engine rooms . The forward engine room held the two turbines for the wing shafts , the middle compartment housed the turbines for the port inner shaft and the aft engine room contained the turbines for the starboard inner shaft . A cruising turbine was built into the casing of each wing turbine . The turbines were powered by twenty @-@ four Yarrow small @-@ tube boilers equally divided between four boiler rooms . They were designed to produce a total of 144 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 107 @,@ 000 kW ) at a working pressure of 235 psi ( 1 @,@ 620 kPa ) , but achieved more than 151 @,@ 000 shp ( 112 @,@ 601 kW ) during Hood 's trials , when she slightly exceeded her designed speed of 31 knots ( 57 km / h ; 36 mph ) . 
 They were designed to normally carry 1 @,@ 200 long tons ( 1 @,@ 219 t ) of fuel oil , but had a maximum capacity of 4 @,@ 000 long tons ( 4 @,@ 064 t ) . At full capacity , Hood could steam at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) for an estimated 7 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 890 km ; 8 @,@ 630 mi ) . They had eight 175 @-@ kilowatt ( 235 hp ) dynamos , two diesel , two turbo @-@ driven , and four reciprocating . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The Admiral @-@ class ships mounted eight BL 15 @-@ inch Mk I guns in four twin hydraulically powered Mark II turrets , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' and ' Y ' from front to rear . The guns could be depressed to − 3 ° and elevated to 30 ° ; they could be loaded at any angle up to 20 ° , although loading at high angles tended to slow the gun 's return to battery . The ships carried 120 shells per gun . They fired 1 @,@ 920 @-@ pound ( 871 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 467 ft / s ( 752 m / s ) ; this provided a maximum range of 29 @,@ 000 yd ( 26 @,@ 518 m ) with armour @-@ piercing ( AP ) shells . 
 Their secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mk I guns , which were mounted on pivot mounts on the forecastle deck , protected by gun shields . They were provided with 200 rounds per gun . The guns on their <unk> mounts had a maximum elevation of 30 ° . They fired 82 @-@ pound ( 37 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 790 ft / s ( 850 m / s ) . Their maximum range was 17 @,@ 700 yd ( 16 @,@ 200 m ) at 30 ° elevation . Their rate of fire was twelve rounds per minute . 
 The Admiral @-@ class ships were designed with four QF four @-@ inch Mark V anti @-@ aircraft guns . They had a maximum depression of -5 ° and a maximum elevation of 80 ° . They fired a 31 @-@ pound ( 14 kg ) high explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 387 ft / s ( 728 m / s ) at a rate of ten to fifteen rounds per minute . The guns had a maximum ceiling of 31 @,@ 000 ft ( 9 @,@ 400 m ) , but an effective range of much less . 
 Two 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) submerged side @-@ loading torpedo tubes were fitted forward of ' A ' turret and eight above @-@ water side @-@ loading Mark V tubes were intended to be mounted abreast the rear funnel on the upper deck , although only four of the latter were carried by Hood . They were loaded and traversed by hydraulic power ; the submerged tubes were fired by compressed air while the above @-@ water tubes used cordite charges . Thirty @-@ two warheads could be accommodated in the two magazines in the hold forward of ' A ' turret 's <unk> . Hood carried Mark IV and IV * torpedoes , each which had a warhead of 515 pounds ( 234 kg ) of TNT . They had three speed settings which governed their range ; from 8 @,@ 000 yards ( 7 @,@ 315 m ) at 35 knots ( 65 km / h ; 40 mph ) , 10 @,@ 000 yards ( 9 @,@ 144 m ) at 29 knots ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) , and 13 @,@ 500 yards ( 12 @,@ 344 m ) at 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) . 
 = = = Fire @-@ control = = = 
 The main guns of the Admiral @-@ class ships were controlled from either of the two fire @-@ control directors . The primary director was mounted above the conning tower in an armoured hood and the other was in the fore @-@ top on the foremast . ' B ' turret could also control all the main gun turrets while ' X ' turret could control the rear guns . Data from a 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) rangefinder in the armoured hood were input into a Mk V Dreyer Fire Control Table located in the Transmitting Station ( TS ) on the platform deck where they were converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns . The target 's data were also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target . The fore @-@ top was equipped with a 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) rangefinder . Each turret was provided with a thirty @-@ foot rangefinder in an armoured housing on the turret roof and a Dumaresq analogue computer for local fire @-@ control . 
 The secondary armament was primarily controlled by the 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch directors mounted on each side of the bridge . They were supplemented by the two additional control positions in the fore @-@ top , which were provided with 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) rangefinders . Each of these positions was equipped with a Dumaresq calculator for local control , but the spotting data were normally sent to the 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch TS on the lower deck much like the procedure for the fifteen @-@ inch guns , except that the firing data were calculated by two Type F fire @-@ control clocks ( analog computers ) . The anti @-@ aircraft guns were controlled by a simple 2 @-@ metre ( 6 ft 7 in ) rangefinder mounted on the aft superstructure . 
 The torpedoes initially had a similar system where various rangefinders , especially the fifteen @-@ foot rangefinder above the aft torpedo control tower , and deflection sights provided data to a Dreyer table in the torpedo TS adjacent to the 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch TS on the lower deck . However the Dreyer table was removed during Hood 's 1929 – 1931 refit and the calculations were made in the torpedo control position in the bridge . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The waterline belt of the Admiral @-@ class ships was 12 inches ( 305 mm ) thick , angled 12 ° outwards partly to keep the belt inside the bulge structure and allow torpedo hits to vent to the atmosphere . This angle also increased the armor 's relative thickness to horizontal , close @-@ range fire , albeit at the cost of reducing its relative height which increased the chance of plunging shellfire going over or under it . This sloped belt made their armor comparable to the 13 inches ( 330 mm ) found in the latest British dreadnoughts . It ran some 562 feet ( 171 @.@ 3 m ) , from the forward edge of ' A ' barbette to the middle of ' Y ' barbette . Forward of this the belt thinned to six inches before further reducing to 5 inches ( 127 mm ) and ending in a five @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) bulkhead well short of the bow . Aft of the midships section the belt reduced to six inches ( 152 mm ) ; it did not reach the stern , but terminated at a five @-@ inch bulkhead . This belt had a height of 9 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 9 m ) , which 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) was below the designed waterline . Above it was the seven @-@ inch middle belt , 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) high , and the five @-@ inch upper belt , which was 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) high . The middle belt stretched between ' A ' and ' Y ' barbettes , ending in four @-@ inch transverse bulkheads at each end . The upper belt only ran from ' A ' barbette to the end of the machinery spaces and ended in another four @-@ inch transverse bulkhead . Five of Hood 's decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from .75 to 3 inches ( 19 to 76 mm ) , with the greatest thicknesses over the magazines and the steering gear . Immediately adjacent to ' A ' and ' Y ' barbettes the main deck was five inches thick to protect the magazines . 
 The turret faces were fifteen inches thick while their sides ranged from 11 to 12 inches ( 279 to 305 mm ) in thickness , and the roof was five inches thick . The barbettes had a maximum of twelve inches of armour , but were reduced in thickness in stages below decks , although the outer faces of ' A ' and ' Y ' barbettes were considerably thicker below decks than the other barbettes . The conning tower armour was nine to eleven inches thick , and it was the largest yet fitted to a British capital ship as it weighed 600 long tons ( 610 t ) . The primary fire @-@ control director atop the conning tower was protected by an armoured hood . The face of the hood was six inches thick , its sides were two inches thick , and its roof was protected by three inches of armour . A communications tube with six @-@ inch sides ran from the conning tower down to the lower conning position on the main deck . The three torpedo bulkheads were 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) , 1 inch ( 25 mm ) and .75 inches ( 19 mm ) thick . 
 The anti @-@ torpedo bulges of the Admiral @-@ class battlecruisers were the first fitted on a British capital ship to fully incorporate the lessons learned from a series of experiments begun before World War I. They consisted of an outer air space , an inner buoyancy space and the 1 @.@ 5 @-@ inch protective bulkhead . The buoyancy space was filled with sealed steel crushing tubes intended to distribute the force of an explosion over as wide an area as possible as well as absorb as much of its force as possible . However , tests conducted after Hood was completed showed that filling the buoyancy space with water was equally as effective and considerably cheaper .

 Shortly after commissioning on 15 May 1920 Hood became flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet , under the command of Rear Admiral Sir Roger Keyes . She made a cruise to Scandinavian waters that year . She visited the Mediterranean in 1921 and 1922 to show the flag and to train with the Mediterranean Fleet , before sailing on a cruise to Brazil and the West Indies in company with the Battlecruiser Squadron . 
 In November 1923 Hood , accompanied by the battlecruiser Repulse and a number of Danae @-@ class cruisers of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron , set out on a world cruise from west to east via the Panama Canal . They returned home ten months later in September 1924 . The Battlecruiser Squadron visited Lisbon in January 1925 to participate in the Vasco da Gama celebrations before continuing on the Mediterranean for exercises . Hood would continue this pattern of a winter training visit to the Mediterranean for the rest of the decade . 
 Hood was given a major refit from 1 May 1929 to 10 March 1931 and afterwards resumed her role as flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron . Later that year her crew participated in the Invergordon Mutiny over pay cuts for the sailors . It ended peacefully and Hood returned to her home port afterwards . The Battlecruiser Squadron made a Caribbean cruise in early 1932 . The next year she resumed her previous practice of a winter cruise in the Mediterranean . While en route to Gibraltar for one of these cruises she collided with the battlecruiser Renown on 23 January 1935 , but was only lightly damaged . Hood participated in King George V 's Silver <unk> Fleet Review at Spithead the following August . She was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet shortly afterward and stationed at Gibraltar at the outbreak of the Second Italo @-@ Abyssinian War and the Spanish Civil War . On 23 April 1937 she escorted three British merchantmen into Bilbao harbour despite the presence of the Nationalist cruiser Almirante Cervera that attempted to blockade the port . She returned to Portsmouth in January 1939 for an overhaul that lasted until 12 August . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 In June 1939 , she was assigned to the Home Fleet ’ s Battlecruiser Squadron while still refitting ; when war broke out later that year , she was employed principally in patrolling the vicinity of Iceland and the Faroe Islands to protect convoys and intercept German raiders attempting to break out into the Atlantic . In September 1939 , she was hit by a 250 kg ( 550 lb ) aircraft bomb with minor damage . By early 1940 Hood 's machinery was in dire shape and limited her best speed to 26 @.@ 5 knots ( 49 @.@ 1 km / h ; 30 @.@ 5 mph ) ; she was refitted between 4 April and 12 June . 
 Hood and the aircraft carrier Ark Royal were ordered to Gibraltar to join Force H on 18 June where Hood would become the flagship . As such , she took part in the destruction of the French Fleet at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kebir in July 1940 . Just eight days after the French surrender , the British Admiralty had issued an ultimatum to the French Fleet at Oran to ensure they would not fall into German or Italian hands . The terms were rejected and the Royal Navy opened fire on the French ships berthed there . The results of Hood 's fire are not known exactly , but she damaged the French battleship Dunkerque , which was hit by four fifteen @-@ inch shells and was forced to beach herself . Hood was straddled during the engagement by Dunkerque ; shell splinters wounded two men . Dunkerque 's sister ship Strasbourg managed to escape from the harbour and Hood with several light cruisers gave chase , but gave up after two hours after Hood had dodged a salvo of torpedoes from the a French sloop and she had stripped a turbine reaching 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) . 
 Hood was relieved as flagship of Force H by Renown on 10 August after returning to Scapa Flow . After a short refit she resumed her previous role in patrolling against German commerce raiders and convoy escort . This lasted until January 1941 when she began a refit that lasted until March . Upon its completion she was ordered to sea in an attempt to intercept the German battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst . Unsuccessful , she was ordered to patrol the Bay of Biscay against any breakout attempt by the German ships from Brest . Hood was ordered to the Norwegian Sea on 19 April when the Admiralty received a false report that the Bismarck had sailed from Germany . Afterwards she patrolled the North Atlantic before putting into Scapa Flow on 6 May .

 On the evening of 21 May 1941 Hood and the newly completed battleship Prince of Wales sailed from Scapa Flow to join the heavy cruisers Norfolk and Suffolk patrolling the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland on the news that Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen had sortied into the North Atlantic . They had not yet reached the Strait when Suffolk spotted the German ships north of Iceland in the early evening on 23 May . Hood and Prince of Wales altered course and increased their speed to intercept . The British squadron spotted the Germans at 5 : 37 a.m. , but the Germans were already aware of their presence . The British opened fire at 05 : 52 with Hood engaging Prinz Eugen , the lead ship in the German formation , and the Germans returned fire 05 : 55 , both ships concentrating on Hood . Prinz Eugen ( probably ) was the first ship to score when a shell hit Hood 's boat deck , between her funnels , and started a large fire among the ready @-@ use ammunition for the anti @-@ aircraft guns and rockets of the Unrotated Projectile mounts . Right before 06 : 00 , while Hood was turning 20 ° to port to unmask her rear turrets , she was hit again on the boat deck by a shell from Bismarck 's fifth salvo . The exact location and sequence of events is unknown , but her aft fifteen @-@ inch magazines exploded . This broke her back and she sank with the loss of all but three of her crew .

 Fighting Tommy Riley is a 2004 American independent film that tells the story of Tommy Riley and Marty Goldberg , a boxer and his trainer , as they work to secure a title shot for Tommy . Their plans are complicated by the unrequited feelings Marty develops for Tommy . When a big @-@ time promoter seeks to acquire Tommy 's contract , Tommy endangers his future career because of his loyalty to Marty . Marty , seeing only one way to free Tommy to take his shot , takes his own life . 
 Directed by Eddie O 'Flaherty , the film was written by J. P. Davis , who sold the script only on the condition that he himself would play Tommy . It also stars Eddie Jones as Marty , Christina Chambers as Stephanie , Diane Tayler as Diane Stone , and Paul Raci as Bob Silver . 
 Fighting Tommy Riley opened in limited release on May 6 , 2005 to generally positive reviews , with Jones 's performance as Marty frequently singled out for praise . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Tommy Riley ( J. P. Davis ) stands in boxing gear in a dingy dressing room . There is a knock at the door and a voice calls out , " Are you ready ? " 
 The film flashes back seven months . Tommy is a former boxer who almost made the 2000 U.S. Olympic boxing team as a middleweight . He works laying computer cable and earns money on the side as a sparring partner in a local gym . His lack of motivation has led his girlfriend Stephanie ( Christina Chambers ) to move out . 
 Marty ( Eddie Jones ) is a former boxer , now a high school teacher and boxing trainer / manager who had previously coached a fighter to a title shot , only to have the fighter leave him just before the fight . Marty and his business partner Diane ( Diane Tayler ) arrive at the gym where Tommy spars to scout his sparring partner . The fighter 's manager instructs Tommy to make his fighter look good , but after he suffers a low blow , Tommy knocks the fighter out with one punch . The manager and the gym 's owner angrily order Tommy from the gym but Marty and Diane chase after him , inviting him to train with Marty . 
 Tommy 's reputation and news of his return to the ring spark interest from promoters . After training some time , Marty and Diane set up a fight so that promoters can see him in action . He wins the fight but the promoter at ringside shows no enthusiasm . 
 Diane gives Marty a tape of Tommy 's 1999 Olympic trial fight . Tommy was ahead after two rounds but quit before round three because of a hand injury . Marty realizes that Tommy faked his injury because of the poor coaching and abuse coming from his stepfather , who was serving as his cornerman . Marty and Tommy talk about Tommy 's stepfather and Marty 's former fighter . Marty tells Tommy that boxing is a team sport and that Tommy will never be alone in the ring . Tommy 's renewed motivation as a fighter leads to a reconciliation with Stephanie . 
 Leroy Kane ( Don Wallace ) , the fighter who went to the Olympics instead of Tommy , wants a " tune @-@ up " fight before his fight for the middleweight title . His scheduled opponent is injured and Diane sets Tommy up for the bout instead . The fight is in four weeks , so Tommy and Marty go to Marty 's cabin in the woods to train without distractions .

 J. P. Davis was inspired to write the script after observing an older trainer working with a young boxer in a Brooklyn gym : " I watched the guy spar . You could tell he wasn 't going anywhere , but you could never convince the trainer . He 's almost a caretaker . He 's watching out for you completely . You could see the devotion involved . " Drawing upon material originally created for his critically acclaimed one @-@ man off @-@ Broadway show " Dreamer Awakens , " Davis completed the script in 1999 and moved to Los Angeles . 
 Unrepresented by management , Davis sent his script out unsolicited to agents and studios over the course of the next three years . Davis secured representation through his efforts and received a number of studio offers , but , in a story reminiscent of Sylvester Stallone 's experience with Rocky , he refused to sell the script unless he was signed to play the title role . He also resisted demands that Marty be made heterosexual . While Davis and director O 'Flaherty honed the script , Davis trained as a boxer to add to the film 's authenticity . The film was shot in Los Angeles on high @-@ definition digital video on a budget of $ 200 @,@ 000 and was O 'Flaherty 's feature debut . 
 The part of Marty was originally to be played by Rod Steiger , but Steiger died in 2002 , before filming could begin .

 Fighting Tommy Riley received generally positive reviews , with Eddie Jones frequently singled out for his performance . Variety gave the film an overall favorable review , citing Jones in particular for " personally push [ ing ] the movie to a higher emotional plane . " Davis and Tayler are also praised , the former for " grow [ ing ] into [ the ] role " and the latter for her " pro job at playing counterpoint " to Jones . Collectively the cast , but especially Jones , is said to elevate the picture above being a " standard drama on the sweet science with the usual tropes . " 
 The San Francisco Chronicle largely agreed , calling Davis " a Van Damme who can act " and Jones " never less than convincing " as well as praising director O 'Flaherty for " coach [ ing ] solid performances from his small cast and mak [ ing ] the most of the handful of up @-@ close , well @-@ choreographed fight montages . " The Los Angeles Times was even more effusive , citing Jones as " unforgettable " and " in such command of his acting skills that Marty 's every gesture , look and movement is expressive and revealing , " Davis ' script as " exceptional " and his performance " no less fully realized " and O 'Flaherty 's direction as " subtle ... intense and convincing . " Tayler and Chambers are also lauded , Tayler for creating a " well drawn " character and Chambers for delivering an " effective " performance . Sports Illustrated called the film " stylish and well @-@ paced " despite its limited budget and echoes others ' praise for Jones 's " nuanced , intense performance , " but ( without mentioning the plot point of Marty 's sexual advance ) pinpoints the retreat to Marty 's cabin as when the script " starts to look and sound like beginners ' work . " 
 When asked to name that year 's notable indie films and directors , famed film critic Roger Ebert stated " First @-@ time director Eddie O ’ Flaherty was able to work outside the system to make Fighting Tommy Riley , a film that I think can play in any theater or any multiplex . And yet it ’ s a boxing picture that is quite different from any formula boxing picture you ’ ve ever seen . In the final analysis , it ’ s not even really about boxing . " 
 Strongly dissenting was the Village Voice , calling the film " [ o ] <unk> sentimental and retrograde " and in need of " serious vetting by [ LGBT media watchdog organization ] GLAAD . " The Voice compared Marty 's fate to that of other cinematic " self @-@ loathing homosexuals " like Martha Dobie of The Children 's Hour . However , writing for the LGBT @-@ interest Advocate magazine , gay film researcher David Ehrenstein praised the film for " speak [ ing ] volumes about those whom the gay rights revolution never touched and about the lives of older gays and lesbians in general .

 = The Hunger Games ( novel ) = 
 The Hunger Games is a 2008 dystopian novel by the American writer Suzanne Collins . It is written in the voice of 16 @-@ year @-@ old Katniss Everdeen , who lives in the future , post @-@ apocalyptic nation of Panem in North America . The Capitol , a highly advanced metropolis , exercises political control over the rest of the nation . The Hunger Games is an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12 – 18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death . 
 The book received mostly positive responses from major reviewers and authors . It was praised for its plot and character development . In writing The Hunger Games , Collins drew upon Greek mythology , Roman gladiatorial games , and contemporary reality television for thematic content . The novel won many awards , including the California Young Reader Medal , and was named one of Publishers Weekly 's " Best Books of the Year " in 2008 . 
 The Hunger Games was first published in hardcover on September 14 , 2008 , by Scholastic , featuring a cover designed by Tim O 'Brien . It has since been released in paperback and also as an audiobook and ebook . After an initial print of 200 @,@ 000 , the book had sold 800 @,@ 000 copies by February 2010 . Since its release , The Hunger Games has been translated into 26 languages , and publishing rights have been sold in 38 territories . The novel is the first in The Hunger Games trilogy , followed by Catching Fire ( 2009 ) and Mockingjay ( 2010 ) . A film adaptation , directed by Gary Ross and co @-@ written and co @-@ produced by Collins herself , was released in 2012 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Collins has said that the inspiration for The Hunger Games came from channel surfing on television . On one channel she observed people competing on a reality show and on another she saw footage of the invasion of Iraq . The two " began to blur in this very unsettling way " and the idea for the book was formed . The Greek myth of Theseus served as a major basis for the story , with Collins describing Katniss as a futuristic Theseus , and Roman gladiatorial games provided the framework . The sense of loss that Collins developed through her father 's service in the Vietnam War was also an influence on the story , with Katniss having lost her father at age 11 , five years before the story begins . Collins stated that the deaths of young characters and other " dark passages " were the most difficult parts of the book to write , but that she had accepted that passages such as these were necessary to the story . She considered the moments where Katniss reflects on happier moments in her past to be more enjoyable . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Hunger Games takes place in a nation known as Panem , established in North America after the destruction of the continent 's civilization by an unknown apocalyptic event . The nation consists of the wealthy Capitol and twelve surrounding , poorer districts united under the Capitol 's control . District 12 , where the book begins , is located in the coal @-@ rich region that was formerly known as Appalachia . 
 As punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol , in which a 13th district was destroyed , one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games , an event in which the participants , the " tributes " , must fight to the death in an outdoor arena controlled by the Capitol , until only one individual remains . The story is narrated by 16 @-@ year @-@ old Katniss Everdeen , a girl from District 12 who volunteers for the 74th annual Hunger Games in place of her younger sister , Primrose . The male tribute chosen from District 12 is Peeta Mellark , a former schoolmate of Katniss who once gave her bread from his family 's bakery when her family was starving . 
 Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol , where their drunken mentor , Haymitch Abernathy , victor of the 50th Hunger Games , instructs them to watch and determine the strengths and weaknesses of the other tributes . " Stylists " are employed to make each tribute look his or her best ; Katniss 's stylist , Cinna , is the only person at the Capitol with whom she feels a degree of understanding . The tributes are publicly displayed to the Capitol audience in an interview with television host Caesar Flickerman , and have to attempt to appeal to the television audience in order to obtain " sponsors " . During this time , Peeta reveals on @-@ air his longtime unrequited love for Katniss . Katniss believes this to be a ploy to gain sponsors , who can be critical to survival because of their ability to send gifts such as food , medicine , and tools to favored tributes during the Games . 
 While nearly half the tributes are killed in the first day of the Games , Katniss relies on her well @-@ practiced hunting and survival skills to remain unharmed and concealed from the other tributes . A few days into the Games , Katniss develops an alliance with Rue , a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl from the agricultural District 11 who reminds Katniss of her younger sister . In the meantime , Peeta appears to have joined forces with the tributes from the richer districts . However , when he has the opportunity to kill Katniss , he instead saves her from the others . Katniss 's alliance with Rue is brought to an abrupt end when Rue is killed by another tribute , whom Katniss then kills in self @-@ defence with an arrow . Katniss sings to Rue until she dies and spreads flowers over her body as a sign of respect for Rue and disgust towards the Capitol . 
 Apparently because of Katniss and Peeta 's image in the minds of the audience as " star @-@ crossed lovers " , a rule change is announced midway through the Games , allowing two tributes from the same district to win the Hunger Games as a couple . Upon hearing this , Katniss begins searching for Peeta . She eventually finds him , wounded and in hiding . As she nurses him back to health , she acts the part of a young girl falling in love to gain more favor with the audience and , consequently , gifts from her sponsors . When the couple remains as the last two surviving tributes , the <unk> reverse the rule change in an attempt to force them into a dramatic finale , in which one must kill the other to win . Katniss , in an act of defiance against the Capitol , retrieves highly poisonous berries known as " <unk> " from her pouch and offers some to Peeta . Realizing that Katniss and Peeta intend to commit suicide , the <unk> announce that both will be the victors of the 74th Hunger Games . 
 Although she survives the ordeal in the arena and is treated to a hero 's welcome in the Capitol , Katniss is warned by Haymitch that she has now become a political target after defying her society 's authoritarian leaders so publicly . Afterwards , Peeta is heartbroken when he learns that Katniss 's actions in the arena were part of a calculated ploy to earn sympathy from the audience . However , Katniss is unsure of her own feelings and realizes that she is dreading the moment when she and Peeta will go their separate ways . 
 = = Themes = = 
 In an interview with Collins , it was noted that the novel " tackles issues like severe poverty , starvation , oppression , and the effects of war among others . " The novel deals with the struggle for self @-@ preservation that the people of Panem face in their districts and the Hunger Games in which they must participate . The citizens ' starvation and their need for resources , both in and outside of the arena , create an atmosphere of helplessness that the main characters try to overcome in their fight for survival . Katniss needs to hunt to provide food for her family , resulting in the development of skills that are useful to her in the Games ( such as her proficiency with the bow and arrow ) , and represents her rejection of the Capitol 's rules in the face of life @-@ threatening situations . On the subject of the Games ' parallels with popular culture , Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly writes that the book " is an incisive satire of reality television shows " , and that the character of Cinna " almost seems like a contestant on a fascist version of Project Runway , using Katniss ' outfits as a vehicle to express potentially dangerous ideas . " 
 The choices the characters make and the strategies they use are often morally complex . The tributes build a personality they want the audience to see throughout the Games . Library journal Voice of Youth Advocates names the major themes of The Hunger Games as " government control , ' big brother ' , and personal independence . " The trilogy 's theme of power and downfall , similar to that of Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar , was pointed out by its publisher Scholastic . Laura Miller of The New Yorker finds the author 's stated premise of the Games – an exercise in propaganda and a " humiliating as well as torturous [ ... ] punishment " for a failed uprising against the Capitol many years earlier – to be unconvincing . " You don 't demoralize and dehumanize a subject people by turning them into celebrities and coaching them on how to craft an appealing persona for a mass audience . " But the story works much better if the theme is vicissitudes of high school and " the adolescent social experience " . Miller writes : 
 " The rules are arbitrary , unfathomable , and subject to sudden change . A brutal social hierarchy prevails , with the rich , the good @-@ looking , and the athletic <unk> their advantages over everyone else . To survive you have to be totally fake . Adults don 't seem to understand how high the stakes are ; your whole life could be over , and they act like it 's just some " phase " ! Everyone 's always watching you , scrutinizing your clothes or your friends and obsessing over whether you 're having sex or taking drugs or getting good enough grades , but no one cares who you really are or how you really feel about anything . " 
 Donald Brake from The Washington Times and pastor Andy Langford state that the story has Christian themes , such as that of self @-@ sacrifice , which is found in Katniss ' substitution for her younger sister , analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus as a substitute for the atonement of sins . Brake , as well as another reviewer , Amy Simpson , both find that the story also revolves around the theme of hope , which is exemplified in the " incorruptible goodness of Katniss ' sister , Primrose . " Simpson also points to events similar to the Passion of Jesus ; in the Games , " Christ figure " Peeta Mellark is stabbed after warning Katniss to flee for her life , and is then buried in the ground and placed in a cave for three days before emerging with a new lease on life . Further , she finds that the Christian image of the Bread of Life is used throughout The Hunger Games ; in the story , Peeta gives Katniss a loaf of bread , saving the girl and her family from starvation .

 After writing the novel , Collins signed a six @-@ figure deal for three books with Scholastic . First published as a hardcover in the United States on September 14 , 2008 , The Hunger Games had a first printing of 50 @,@ 000 copies , which was bumped up twice to 200 @,@ 000 copies . By February 2010 , the book had sold 800 @,@ 000 copies , and rights to the novel had been sold in 38 territories worldwide . A few months later , in July , the book was released in paperback . The Hunger Games entered the New York Times Best Seller list in November 2008 , where it would feature for over 100 consecutive weeks . By the time the film adaptation of The Hunger Games was released in March 2012 , the book had been on USA Today 's best @-@ sellers list for 135 consecutive weeks and has sold over 17 @.@ 5 million copies . 
 The novel is the first in The Hunger Games trilogy ; it is followed by sequels Catching Fire ( 2009 ) and Mockingjay ( 2010 ) . In March 2012 , during the time of The Hunger Games film 's release , Scholastic reported 26 million Hunger Games trilogy books in print , including movie tie @-@ in books . The Hunger Games ( and its sequels ) have sold exceptionally well in ebook format . Suzanne Collins is the first children 's or young adult author to sell over one million Amazon Kindle ebooks , making her the sixth author to join the " Kindle Million Club " . In March 2012 , Amazon announced that Collins had become the best @-@ selling Kindle ebook author of all time . 
 An audiobook version of The Hunger Games was released in December 2008 . Read by the actress Carolyn McCormick , it has a total running time of eleven hours and fourteen minutes . The magazine AudioFile said : " Carolyn McCormick gives a detailed and attentive narration . However , she may rely too much on the strength of the prose without providing the drama young adult listeners often enjoy . " School Library Journal also praised the audiobook , stating that " McCormick ably voices the action @-@ packed sequences and Katniss 's every fear and strength shines through , along with her doomed growing attraction to one of her fellow Tributes . " 
 The Tim O 'Brien @-@ designed cover features a gold " <unk> " – a fictional bird in The Hunger Games born by crossbreeding female mockingbirds and genetically engineered male " <unk> " – with an arrow engraved in a circle . This is a depiction of the pin worn by Katniss into the arena , given to her by the District 12 mayor 's daughter , Madge <unk> . The image matches the description of the pin that is given in the novel , except for the arrow : " It 's as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it . The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips . "

 The Hunger Games has received critical acclaim . In a review for The New York Times , John Green wrote that the novel was " brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced " , and that " the considerable strength of the novel comes in Collins 's convincingly detailed world @-@ building and her memorably complex and fascinating heroine . " However , he also noted that , while allegorically rich , the book sometimes does not realize the allegorical potential that the plot has to offer and that the writing " described the action and little else . " Time magazine 's review was also positive , stating that it " is a chilling , bloody and thoroughly horrifying book " and praising what it called the " hypnotic " quality of the violence . In Stephen King 's review for Entertainment Weekly , he compared it to " shoot @-@ it @-@ if @-@ it @-@ moves videogames in the lobby of the local <unk> ; you know it 's not real , but you keep plugging in quarters anyway . " However , he stated that there were " displays of authorial laziness that kids will accept more readily than adults " and that the love triangle was standard for the genre . He gave the book a B grade . Elizabeth Bird of School Library Journal praised the novel , saying it is " exciting , poignant , thoughtful , and breathtaking by turns " , and called it one of the best books of 2008 . Booklist also gave a positive review , praising the character violence and romance involved in the book . Kirkus Reviews gave a positive review , praising the action and world @-@ building , but pointed out that " poor copyediting in the first printing will distract careful readers – a crying shame " . Rick Riordan , author of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series , claims it is the " closest thing to a perfect adventure novel " he has ever read . Stephenie Meyer ( author of the Twilight series ) endorsed the book on her website , saying , " I was so obsessed with this book ... The Hunger Games is amazing . " 
 The Hunger Games received many awards and honors . It was named one of Publishers Weekly 's " Best Books of the Year " in 2008 and a The New York Times " Notable Children 's Book of 2008 " . It was the 2009 winner of the Golden Duck Award in the Young Adult Fiction Category . The Hunger Games was also a " 2008 Cybil Winner " for fantasy and science @-@ fiction books along with The Graveyard Book , one of School Library Journal 's " Best Books 2008 " , and a " Booklist Editors ' Choice " in 2008 . In 2011 , the book won the California Young Reader Medal . In the 2012 edition of Scholastic 's Parent and Child magazine , The Hunger Games was listed as the 33rd @-@ best book for children , with the award for " Most Exciting Ending " . The novel is one of the top 5 best selling Kindle books of all time . However , the novel has also been controversial with parents ; it ranked in fifth place on the American Library Association 's list of frequently challenged books for 2010 , with " unsuited to age group " and " violence " being among the reasons cited . 
 Similarities of The Hunger Games to <unk> Takami 's 1999 novel Battle Royale have been noted . Collins stated that she " had never heard of that book or that author until my book was turned in . At that point , it was mentioned to me , and I asked my editor if I should read it . He said : ' No , I don 't want that world in your head . Just continue with what you 're doing ' . " Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that " the parallels are striking enough that Collins 's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a <unk> ripoff " of Battle Royale but argued that " there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently . " Stephen King noted that the reality TV " badlands " were similar to Battle Royale , as well as his own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk . Eric Eisenberg wrote that The Hunger Games was " not a rip off of Battle Royale , but simply a different usage of a similar idea " , pointing out various differences in both story and themes . 
 = = Film adaptation = = 
 In March 2009 , Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co @-@ production agreement for The Hunger Games with Nina Jacobson 's production company Color Force , which had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the novel a few weeks earlier . The studio , which had not made a profit for five years , raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $ 88 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 – one of its largest ever – for the film . Collins ' agent Jason Dravis remarked that " they [ Lionsgate ] had everyone but the valet call us " to help secure the franchise . Intending the film to have a PG @-@ 13 rating , Collins adapted the novel for film herself , in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross . The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel , with Ross saying he " felt the only way to make the film really successful was to be totally subjective " in its presentation of events , echoing Collins ' use of first person present in the novel . 
 Twenty @-@ year @-@ old actress Jennifer Lawrence was chosen to play Katniss Everdeen . Though Lawrence was four years older than the character when filming began , Collins felt the role demanded " a certain maturity and power " and said she would rather the actress be older than younger . She added that Lawrence was the " only one who truly captured the character I wrote in the book " and that she had " every essential quality necessary to play Katniss . " Lawrence , a fan of the books , took three days to accept the role , initially intimidated by the size of the production . Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth were later added to the cast , in the roles of Peeta and Gale , respectively . Production began in late spring 2011 and the film was released on March 23 , 2012 . The film 's opening weekend brought in a non @-@ sequel record $ 152 @.@ 5 million ( USD ) in North America . The Hunger Games : Catching Fire , based on the second novel in the series , was released the following year on November 22 , 2013 . 
 = Viper dogfish = 
 The viper dogfish or viper shark ( Trigonognathus <unk> ) is a rare species of dogfish shark in the family Etmopteridae , and the only extant member of its genus . It has been found in the Pacific Ocean off southern Japan , the Bonin Islands , and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands . This species inhabits upper continental slopes and seamounts . It may migrate vertically , shifting between bottom waters 270 – 360 m ( 890 – 1 @,@ 180 ft ) deep during the day and upper waters less than 150 m ( 490 ft ) deep at night . A slender , black shark reaching 54 cm ( 21 in ) in length , the viper dogfish can be recognized by its narrow , triangular jaws and well @-@ spaced , fang @-@ like teeth . It also has two spined dorsal fins , dermal denticles with faceted crowns , and numerous light @-@ emitting photophores concentrated on its ventral surface . 
 Feeding mainly on bony fishes , the viper dogfish captures prey by protruding its jaws and impaling them with its teeth . Its impressive gape allows it to swallow relatively large fish whole . The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism , which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks . This shark gives birth to live young , which are nourished by yolk during gestation ; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups . Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls . The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The first specimens of the viper dogfish were two immature males caught off southern Japan by the bottom trawler <unk> @-@ Maru in 1986 . The first , designated as the holotype , measured 22 cm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) long and was collected off Cape <unk> at a depth of 330 m ( 1 @,@ 080 ft ) . The second measured 37 cm ( 15 in ) long and was collected off <unk> , Tokushima at a depth of 360 m ( 1 @,@ 180 ft ) . The shark was described as a new species and genus by University of Tokyo researchers Kenji Mochizuki and Fumio Ohe in a 1990 article for the Japanese Journal of Ichthyology . They gave it the name Trigonognathus <unk> ; the generic name is derived from the Greek <unk> ( " triangle " ) and <unk> ( " jaw " ) , while the specific name honors Hiromichi <unk> , the captain of the <unk> @-@ Maru . 
 Mochizuki and Ohe originally assigned the viper dogfish to the family <unk> , which at the time was used for all members of the order Squaliformes aside from the bramble and rough sharks . In a 1992 morphological study , Shigeru Shirai and Osamu Okamura placed this species in the squalid subfamily <unk> , which most taxonomists now recognize as the separate family Etmopteridae . 
 = = Phylogeny and evolution = = 
 The position of Trigonognathus within the Etmopteridae is uncertain . Morphological and molecular phylogenetic data generally support the subdivision of the Etmopteridae into two clades , one consisting of Etmopterus and <unk> and the other consisting of Centroscyllium and <unk> . Phylogenetic analyses have variously placed Trigonognathus as closer to one clade or the other or as basal to both , depending on which morphological characters , nuclear DNA markers , and / or mitochondrial DNA markers were used . 
 Based on molecular clock estimation , Trigonognathus is thought to have originated around 41 million years ago during the Middle Eocene , as part of a larger evolutionary radiation of <unk> genera . The genus is represented in this time period by the extinct species T. <unk> , whose fossilized teeth have been recovered from Lutetian age ( 47 @.@ 8 – 41 @.@ 3 Mya ) strata in Landes , southwestern France . Fossil teeth virtually identical to those of the modern viper dogfish are known from the Cubagua Formation in northeastern Venezuela , which dates to the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene ( 11 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 6 Mya ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The viper dogfish has a slender , cylindrical body and a moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout . Behind the large oval eyes are narrow , elliptical spiracles . The nostrils are nearly vertical slits . The jaws are long and narrowly triangular , and can be protruded from the head . The teeth are distinctively fang @-@ like and widely spaced ; the most anterior teeth are grooved lengthwise . Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side , along with a single tooth row at the upper and lower symphyses ( jaw midpoints ) . The teeth are largest at the symphysis and decline in size towards the corners of the mouth . When the mouth is closed , the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower , while the lateral teeth interlock . Five gill slits are seen , with the fifth pair longer than the others . 
 The fins are small and very thin . The pectoral fins are rounded and lobe @-@ like . The two dorsal fins are positioned about between the pectoral and pelvic fins . Each dorsal fin bears a slightly grooved spine in front ; the second dorsal spine is longer than the first . The anal fin is absent , and the caudal peduncle lacks keels or notches . The upper lobe of the caudal fin is larger than the lower and has a notch in the trailing margin . The skin , excluding on the fins , is densely covered with irregularly arranged , nonoverlapping dermal denticles . Each denticle has a swollen rhombic shape with 10 – 40 facets on the crown . The viper dogfish is black with distinct darker markings on the underside . These markings contain large numbers of tiny light @-@ producing photophores ; more photophores are found sparsely scattered over the rest of the body , as well as in a translucent patch on the upper eyelid . The fins are translucent , and the tip of the caudal fin upper lobe is blackish . The largest known male is 47 cm ( 19 in ) long and weighs 0 @.@ 43 kg ( 0 @.@ 95 lb ) , and the largest female is 54 cm ( 21 in ) long and weighs 0 @.@ 76 kg ( 1 @.@ 7 lb ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Most specimens of the viper dogfish have been collected from a relatively small area of the northwestern Pacific Ocean off the Kii Peninsula in Japan . A number of specimens were also recovered from the stomachs of predatory fishes caught in the Bonin Islands . One specimen was caught from the Hancock Seamount , located some 300 km ( 190 mi ) northwest of Kure Atoll in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands . During the day , this species has been caught close to the bottom on the upper reaches of continental slopes and seamounts , at depths of 270 – 360 m ( 890 – 1 @,@ 180 ft ) . At night , it has been caught between the surface and a depth of 150 m ( 490 ft ) in water over 1 @.@ 5 km ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) deep . This pattern suggests the viper dogfish performs a diel vertical migration , spending the day in deeper water and rising towards the surface at night ; such daily movement may relate to feeding . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The viper dogfish feeds primarily on bony fishes , notably lanternfishes in the genera <unk> and <unk> , and also takes crustaceans . Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting , in contrast to the short jaws and saw @-@ like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat . Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws and swallowed whole ; the shark can consume fish close to 40 % as long as itself . The viper dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle , which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting . Jaw protrusion is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone , which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward . This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws , as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally . 
 Known predators of the viper dogfish include the bigeye tuna ( Thunnus obesus ) and the sickle <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) . Like other members of its family , this species is viviparous with the developing embryos sustained to term by yolk . Adult females have two functional ovaries and two functional uteri . Two of the recorded female specimens contained 25 and 26 mature ova ; in the related black dogfish ( Centroscyllium fabricii ) , the number of mature ova in a female is slightly greater than the number of resulting embryos , which suggests a litter size under 26 in the viper dogfish . Males and females mature sexually at roughly 43 and 52 cm ( 17 and 20 in ) long , respectively .

 The viper dogfish has no economic value . It is very infrequently caught in commercial purse seines and bottom trawls targeting other species , though what effect , if any , fishing has on its population is unknown . As a result , the IUCN has listed it under Data Deficient . 
 = Ernest R. Kouma = 
 Ernest Richard Kouma ( November 23 , 1919 – December 19 , 1993 ) was a soldier in the United States Army during World War II and the Korean War . He rose to the rank of Master Sergeant and received the Medal of Honor for his actions on August 31 and September 1 , 1950 , during the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge in South Korea . 
 Born in Nebraska , Kouma grew up on a family farm before enlisting in the US Army in 1940 . Kouma served as a tank commander during World War II , seeing combat in Germany with the 9th Armored Division from 1944 to 1945 . After that war , Kouma served as part of the occupation force in South Korea and Japan . 
 On the outbreak of the Korean War , Kouma commanded an M26 Pershing tank in the 2nd Infantry Division . While fighting during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter along the Naktong River , Kouma commanded his tank as it single @-@ handedly fended off repeated North Korean attempts to cross the river after units around it had withdrawn . Wounded twice , Kouma killed 250 North Korean troops in this action . 
 After receiving the medal , Kouma served as a recruiter and remained in the Army for 31 years , retiring in 1971 . He lived in Kentucky until his death , and is buried in Fort Knox , Kentucky .

 Ernest Richard Kouma was born on November 23 , 1919 , in Dwight , Nebraska , to a farming family . He spent much of his early life on the family farm before enlisting in the United States Army in June 1940 . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 When the United States entered World War II , Kouma was trained as a tank crew member . He was assigned to the 9th Armored Division . The Division landed in Normandy late in September 1944 , and moved to the front lines on October 23 . Its first mission was patrol duty in a quiet sector along the Luxembourg @-@ German frontier . When the Germans launched their winter offensive , the 9th Armored Division was quickly involved in the Battle of the Bulge with next to no experience . The Division saw very heavy action at St. Vith , Echternach and Bastogne , its units , unprepared to counter the offensive , fighting in widely separated areas . 
 The 9th Armored Division made a stand at Bastogne and held off the Germans long enough to enable the 101st Airborne Division to dig in for a defense of the city , resulting in the Battle of Bastogne . After a rest period in January 1945 , the 9th Armored Division made preparations for a drive across the Roer River . The offensive was launched on February 28 , and the 9th smashed across the Roer to <unk> , sending patrols into Remagen . The Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen was found intact , and was seized by elements of the 9th Armored Division minutes before demolition charges were set to explode on March 7 , 1945 . The division exploited the bridgehead , moving south and east across the Lahn River toward Limburg , where thousands of Allied prisoners were liberated . The Division drove on to Frankfurt and then turned to assist in the closing of the Ruhr Pocket . In April it continued east , encircled Leipzig and secured a line along the <unk> River . The division was shifting south to Czechoslovakia when the war in Europe ended on V @-@ E Day in May 1945 . 
 Following the end of the war , Kouma decided to stay in the Army . He was moved to South Korea for occupation duties before being moved to Japan for the post @-@ war occupation of that country . Eventually , Kouma was assigned as a tank commander in A Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , 2nd Infantry Division , which was stationed at Fort Lewis , Washington . By this time he had a home in Penobscot County , Maine when he was not at Fort Lewis . 
 = = = Korean War = = = 
 Following the outbreak of war between North Korea and South Korea on June 25 , 1950 , the United States mobilized a large contingent of troops to send into the beleaguered country . Initially , units occupying Japan were called into the country , but forces were eventually dispatched from the United States . In August 1950 , Kouma , who was then a Sergeant First Class , sailed for Korea along with much of the 2nd Infantry Division . It arrived there in late August and was moved into line at the Pusan Perimeter , where US troops were fighting a tight defensive line around the port city of Pusan . 
 The North Korean People 's Army , meanwhile , was preparing for a September offensive by capturing the Miryang and Samnangjin areas to cut off the US 2nd Division 's route of supply and withdrawal between Daegu and Busan . However , the North Koreans were unaware that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the US 24th Infantry Division in positions along the Naktong River . Consequently , they expected lighter resistance ; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea . They had only established their lines shortly before the North Koreans began the attack . The North Koreans began crossing the Naktong River under cover of darkness at certain points . On the southern @-@ most flank of the US 9th Infantry Regiment river line , just above the junction of the Nam River with the Naktong , A Company of the 1st Battalion was dug in on a long finger ridge paralleling the Naktong that terminates in Hill 94 at the <unk> ferry site . The river road from Namji @-@ ri running west along the Naktong passes the southern tip of this ridge and crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry . A small village called Agok lay at the base of Hill 94 and 300 yards ( 270 m ) from the river . A patrol of tanks and armored vehicles , together with two infantry squads of A Company , 9th Infantry , held a roadblock near the ferry and close to Agok . On the evening of August 31 , A Company moved from its ridge positions overlooking Agok and the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line . 
 = = = Medal of Honor action = = = 
 That evening Kouma led the patrol of two M26 Pershing tanks and two M19 Gun Motor Carriages in Agok , along the Naktong River . Kouma placed his patrol on the west side of Agok near the <unk> ferry . At 20 : 00 a heavy fog covered the river , and at 22 : 00 mortar shells began falling on the American @-@ held side of the river . By 22 : 15 this strike intensified and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company 's positions . American mortars and artillery began firing counter @-@ battery . Some of A Company 's men reported hearing noises on the opposite side of the river and splashes in the water . 
 At 22 : 30 the fog lifted and Kouma saw that a North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river directly in front of his position . Kouma 's four vehicles attacked this structure , with Kouma manning the M2 Browning .50 @-@ caliber machine gun atop the tank . As the gunner fired the tank 's main cannon , Kouma sank many of the boats attempting to cross the river with his machine gun . At 23 : 00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks . This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks heard over the field telephone that the company was withdrawing and that they should do likewise . Kouma instead opted to act as a rearguard to cover the infantry . He was wounded shortly thereafter in the foot reloading the tank 's ammunition . He quickly fought off another North Korean attack across the river with his machine gun . 
 Kouma 's force was then ambushed by a group of North Koreans dressed in US military uniforms . Kouma was wounded a second time , in the shoulder , as he beat back repeated North Korean crossings on his machine gun . Several strong attacks came within meters of the tank , but Kouma was able to drive them back despite his wounds . Eventually , the other three vehicles withdrew or were neutralized , and Kouma held the Agok crossing site until 07 : 30 the next morning with his tank . At one point , the tank was surrounded and Kouma had to engage the North Koreans from outside the tank with machine gun fire at point blank range . After the tank gun 's ammunition was expended , Kouma used his pistol and grenades to hold off the North Koreans . The tank then withdrew 8 miles ( 13 km ) to the newly established American lines , destroying three North Korean machine gun positions along the way . During his action , Kouma had killed an estimated 250 North Korean troops . His actions in this fight alone surpassed the highly decorated US Army soldier Audie Murphy , who was credited with 240 kills during World War II , and who had been the second most decorated US soldier in the war . 
 Once he returned to his unit , Kouma attempted to resupply his tank and return to the front lines . Instead , the wounded Kouma was ordered to evacuate for medical treatment . As he was being evacuated , Kouma again requested to return to the front lines . 
 = = = Subsequent career and retirement = = = 
 Kouma was returned to duty three days later . Shortly thereafter , he was promoted to Master Sergeant , and evacuated to the United States , to be presented with the Medal of Honor for his actions . Originally , Kouma had been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross , but that award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor . 
 On May 19 , 1951 , Kouma was presented the Medal of Honor by US President Harry S. Truman in a ceremony at the White House . He got his medal alongside Carl Dodd and John Pittman , two other 2nd Infantry Division soldiers who were awarded the medal . After being awarded the medal , Kouma served as a recruiter in Omaha , Nebraska . Kouma then spent the remainder of the Korean War as a tank gunnery instructor for the US Army Armor School at Fort Knox , Kentucky . 
 Following the end of the war , Kouma remained in the Army . He served a second tour of duty as a recruiter , and then two tours as a tank commander , first at a unit in Fort Carson , Colorado , and then with a second unit in Germany . Though he remained in the Army for 31 years , Kouma did not see combat after his time in Korea . Kouma retired in 1971 at the age of 52 , and lived a quiet life in McDaniels , Kentucky , after retirement . Kouma died on December 19 , 1993 , and was buried in the Fort Knox post cemetery . The Tank Platoon Gunnery Excellence competition at Fort Knox was subsequently named in Kouma 's honor . There is a dining facility named in his honor at Fort Knox on Eisenhower Road .

 M / Sgt. Kouma , a tank commander in Company A , distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy . His unit was engaged in supporting infantry elements on the Naktong River front . Near midnight on August 31 , a hostile force estimated at 500 crossed the river and launched a fierce attack against the infantry positions , inflicting heavy casualties . A withdrawal was ordered and his armored unit was given the mission of covering the movement until a secondary position could be established . The enemy assault overran 2 tanks , destroyed 1 and forced another to withdraw . Suddenly M / Sgt. Kouma discovered that his tank was the only obstacle in the path of the hostile onslaught . Holding his ground , he gave fire orders to his crew and remained in position throughout the night , fighting off repeated enemy attacks . During 1 fierce assault , the enemy surrounded his tank and he leaped from the armored turret , exposing himself to a hail of hostile fire , manned the .50 caliber machine gun mounted on the rear deck , and delivered pointblank fire into the fanatical foe . His machine gun emptied , he fired his pistol and threw grenades to keep the enemy from his tank . After more than 9 hours of constant combat and close @-@ in fighting , he withdrew his vehicle to friendly lines . During the withdrawal through 8 miles of hostile territory , M / Sgt. Kouma continued to inflict casualties upon the enemy and exhausted his ammunition in destroying 3 hostile machine gun positions . During this action , M / Sgt. Kouma killed an estimated 250 enemy soldiers . His magnificent stand allowed the infantry sufficient time to reestablish defensive positions . Rejoining his company , although suffering intensely from his wounds , he attempted to resupply his tank and return to the battle area . While being evacuated for medical treatment , his courage was again displayed when he requested to return to the front . M / Sgt. Kouma 's superb leadership , heroism , and intense devotion to duty reflect the highest credit on himself and uphold the esteemed traditions of the U.S. Army . 
 = St Mary 's Church , Bodewryd = 
 St Mary 's Church , Bodewryd is a small medieval church in the hamlet of Bodewryd , in Anglesey , north Wales . The date of construction is unknown , but there was a church on this site in 1254 and the earliest feature to which a date can be given is a doorway in a 15th @-@ century style dating to around 1500 . When the church was restored in 1867 after being struck by lightning , stained glass with Islamic @-@ influenced patterns was included in the windows , a requirement of Lord Stanley of Alderley , the church 's benefactor , who was a convert to Islam . 
 The church is used for worship by the Church in Wales , and is one of five churches in a combined parish . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " , in particular because it is a " simple , rural church of Medieval origins . " 
 = = History and location = = 
 The date of foundation of the first religious building on this site is unknown . A church was recorded here in the Norwich Taxation of 1254 , and the church was owned by the Augustinian priory at Penmon , at the south @-@ eastern corner of Anglesey , during the 13th century ; the priory also owned ( and therefore received the tithes from ) the Anglesey churches of Llanddona and St Cwyllog , Llangwyllog at this time . The current building has medieval walls , and the doorway of the porch on the north side of the church , which is of 15th @-@ century style , is the oldest dateable part of the building . A 2009 guide to the buildings of north @-@ west Wales put the date for the doorway at <unk> St Mary 's was restored in 1867 by Henry Kennedy , the architect of the Diocese of Bangor , after the previous church was struck by lightning . It was funded by Lord Stanley of Alderley , a convert to Islam , whose donations to rural churches carried the requirement that Islamic detail should be included in any restoration work . At St Mary 's , the windows have geometric patterns of small panes of coloured glass as a result . This condition was also imposed by him for the restoration work at the nearby church of St <unk> , Rhosbeirio ( now closed ) , where the new windows were also decorated with geometric patterns in glass . 
 For many years , the church was associated with the Wynn ( or Wynne ) family of Bodewryd . They had an estate at Bodewryd from 1521 until 1755 , when Edward Wynne ( Chancellor of the Diocese of Hereford from 1707 to 1754 ) died without male heirs . His uncle , Humphrey Humphreys ( who was Bishop of Bangor and then Bishop of Hereford ) , was married in St Mary 's in 1690 ; the bishop 's sister had married into the Wynne family in 1672 . 
 The church is by the side of the road in Bodewryd , in the north of Anglesey , about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from the town of Amlwch . It is surrounded by a rectangular churchyard , entered through a wooden gate . It is still in use for worship , belonging to the Church in Wales , and is part of the combined parish of <unk> with Bodewryd with Rhosbeirio with Llanfflewin and <unk> . It is within the deanery of Twrcelyn , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2012 , the rector is the Reverend Canon G W Edwards . The church was used at one time as a chapel of ease for St Eilian 's Church , Llaneilian . 
 = = Architecture and fittings = = 
 The rectangular church , which has been described as " tiny " , is said by the Diocese of Bangor to be the second @-@ smallest church in Anglesey . The nave and chancel ( which are not divided ) measure together 34 feet 9 inches by 14 feet ( about 10 @.@ 6 m by 4 @.@ 3 m ) . The church is constructed of rubble masonry , dressed with freestone and with a foundation of boulders . The roof , which has a bellcote at the west end , is made of slate ; the roof timbers can be seen from inside . The only bell , which is dated 1747 , is decorated with a vine scroll . The door to the church is on the north side through a porch ; the doorway to the porch has a rounded head and a 15th @-@ century style doorjamb , but the porch itself is more modern . The windows in the nave ( one in the north wall , one in the west wall and two in the south wall ) have rounded tops . The window at the east end of the church , which dates from the late 16th century , is rectangular with three arched lights ( vertical sections ) set in a square frame . The lights are separated by mullions and there is an external hoodmould above the window . 
 There are two fonts : one , which may be medieval in origin , is a gritstone bowl of rectangular shape ; the other , which may have been added during the 19th @-@ century restoration , is an oval alabaster bowl , with rich decoration . The south wall of the chancel has a brass tablet to mark money received from Queen Anne 's Bounty in 1720 and Robert Wynn , rector of Llantrisant , Anglesey , in 1727 . There are various memorials on the interior walls . Edward Wynne ( who is buried in the churchyard ) , his siblings and parents are commemorated by various brass tablets . The 1937 survey of the church by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire claims that seven generations of Wynne 's male ancestors were buried in the church , beginning with Rees ap Llewelyn in 1500 . The survey also recorded that the church possessed a silver cup from about 1641 donated by Wynne , a silver cup and paten donated by his sister Ellin in 1703 , and part of an oak table top with a Latin inscription and the date 1611 . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building – the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " . It was given this status on 12 May 1970 and has been listed as " a simple , rural church of Medieval origins " . Cadw ( the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) notes that it " retains Medieval fabric but is largely of 19th @-@ century character " , describing it as a " simple vernacular building . " 
 The 19th @-@ century antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the church as a " small ancient edifice " . She noted the memorials to the <unk> as well as a tablet marking Edward Wynne 's " munificence " : she recorded that he had donated 121 acres ( 49 ha ) in 1722 and a rent charge of £ 2 to endow the living , and that £ 800 was also received from Queen Anne 's Bounty . A 2006 guide to the churches of the county describes it as " one of the smallest churches in Anglesey " , and says that it stood " in a pleasant location . "

 Ned ( Sean Bean ) confronts Queen Cersei ( Lena Headey ) , telling her that he knows Prince Joffrey and his siblings are not King Robert 's ( Mark Addy ) children , but were incestuously fathered by her brother Jaime . Cersei defends her affair with Jaime , comparing it to the ancient Targaryen practice of wedding brothers to sisters and saying she tried to love Robert , but he refused to love her because he was still in love with Ned 's deceased sister , <unk> . Ned shows Cersei mercy and tells her to leave the capital with her children before he tells Robert the truth . 
 Unexpectedly , Lord Renly Baratheon ( Gethin Anthony ) returns and informs Ned that , while hunting , Robert was mortally wounded by a boar .

Ned writes down Robert 's words , but instead of using " Joffrey , " Ned writes " my rightful heir , " making the succession ambiguous . Robert signs the will without reading this change in wording and begs Ned to make Joffrey a better man . Robert also tells Ned that he was wrong to have ordered Daenerys Targaryen 's assassination and orders Ned to let her live . 
 Fearing Cersei and the Lannisters will use this time to their advantage , Renly tries to convince Ned they should raise an army and launch a coup d 'état ; however , Ned refuses him .

 " You Win or You Die " marks the first appearance of Charles Dance as Lord Tywin , the patriarch of the Lannister household . Cast in the role shortly after the production began , Dance had been the first choice of the producers and one of the fan favorites for the role . Author George R. R. Martin commented that " his commanding screen presence and steely charisma should make him the perfect Lord Tywin . " The deer that is field dressed by Tywin in the opening scene was a real dead stag . Dance had no previous experience with skinning and gutting , and before filming the scene practiced for an hour with a butcher .

 Most of the episode was shot on set at the Irish studios of The Paint Hall . The exteriors of the entrance of Vaes Dothrak were filmed in the Sandy Brae area , and for the confrontation between Eddard and Cersei taking place in the Red Keep 's gardens ( identified as a <unk> in the novels ) the production used the cloister of the St Dominic Monastery in Rabat , in Malta .

 The episode was well received by critics . Time 's reviewer James Poniewozik called " You Win or You Die " the " most thrilling and thematically rich hour to date , " AOL TV 's Maureen Ryan found it an excellent outing that " saw the stakes raised in satisfying and suspenseful ways , " and HitFix 's Alan Sepinwall called it a terrific episode and commended how " it turned the spotlight on the characters who are villains in Ned Stark 's version of the story . " 
 Poniewozik continued : " We knew this would be a significant episode if for no other reason than that it contains the scene — alluded to in the episode 's title — that gives the series its name , " a sentiment Sepinwall agreed with . Myles McNutt , writing for Cultural Learnings , also considered " You Win or You Die " a climactic moment in the series . IGN 's Matt Fowler noted that this was the episode that saw Ned Stark " unfortunately thwarted by his own honorable intentions , " but that his " stubborn nobility is what makes Ned such a great character . " 
 The final showdown with the Lannisters seizing control from Eddard was much discussed , with many commentators criticizing Ned 's ingenuity and his actions during the episode . In The Atlantic , Scott Meslow wrote that Eddard could never win the " game of thrones " because he is dedicated to playing by the rules . In his opinion , " one can 't afford to play fair " when the only outcomes are " win " or " die . " McNutt felt that the climax at the episode 's end " was really well handled by both the cast and the director ( Dan Minahan ) . " 
 As well as the final confrontation between Eddard and Cersei , other scenes were praised by the critics . The introduction of Charles Dance as Lord Tywin Lannister was considered " a beauty " by Todd VanDerWerff from the A.V. Club , who admired how a single scene depicted not only the relationship between Tywin and Jaime , but also all the dynamics of the Lannister clan . He also praised the work of Nikolaj Coster @-@ Waldau in the scene , commenting that despite having few lines , he transmitted that Jaime is cowed by his father very well . Maureen Ryan agreed with that sentiment , and also lauded Natalia Tena 's short appearance . David Sims ( a second reviewer for the A.V. Club ) highlighted the work of Mark Addy in his final scene , extending the praise to the rest of his work on the series . 
 Critics agreed that the scenes with the Dothraki were strong , with the storyline having improved significantly since the first episodes . Poniewozik stated that " this was the first week for me that the Dothraki scenes were not just absorbing but felt like the characters were as well @-@ imagined as those in Westeros , " and McNutt felt the episode " finally allows Khal Drogo to become an actual character . " Drogo 's rant vowing to give his unborn son the Iron Throne led to compliments about Jason Momoa 's intensity and Emilia Clarke 's calm and loving facial expressions . 
 However , the scene where Littlefinger exposes his motivations while hiring two whores for his brothel was largely criticized as an example of the show 's perceived abuse of conversations with prostitutes as an expository device , a situation for which Myles McNutt coined the term " <unk> . " Aidan Gillen 's acting was consistently praised and the comparison between Littlefinger 's actions and faking an orgasm was considered apt , but many agreed with Meslow 's statement that it was " annoyingly overshadowed by the series ' most gratuitous sex scene to date . " Among other criticisms were the scene 's excessive length , the repetition of the dramatic approach , and the assumption that viewers were not going to pay attention when presented with a long exposition that did not include sex . 
 = Igbo people = 
 The Igbo people , often erroneously spelled and pronounced " Ibo " ( because certain Europeans had difficulty making the / ɡ ͡ b / sound ) , are an indigenous linguistic and cultural people of southern Nigeria . Geographically , the Igbo homeland is divided into two unequal sections by the Niger River – an eastern ( which is the larger of the two ) and a western section . Culturally and linguistically , the Niger River has provided an easy means of communication and unity amongst the Igbo natives on both sides , as well as promoted ancient trade and movement of peoples between Igboland and rest of the world . 
 Known as Ndi Igbo in the Igbo language and sometimes identified by their respective Igboid dialects or <unk> , such the <unk> and the <unk> , the culture of the Igbos has been shaped primarily by Igboland 's rainforest climate , its historic trades , ancient migration folklores and social ties with its neighbours as well as far @-@ flung trading and political allies and lately with the Europeans through colonization and the entire Western World through globalization . They speak Igbo , which includes various Igboid languages and dialects . The Igbo homeland is almost surrounded on all sides by other ethnic peoples of southern and central Nigeria namely , the <unk> , Edo , <unk> , <unk> , Igala , Tiv , Yako , <unk> and Ibibio . 
 The Igbo people are one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa . In rural Nigeria , Igbo people work mostly as craftsmen , farmers and traders . The most important crop is the yam ; celebrations take place annually to celebrate its harvesting . Other staple crops include cassava and taro . The Igbos are also highly urbanized , with some of the largest cities and metropolitan areas in Igboland being Onitsha , Enugu , Aba , Asaba , Owerri , Orlu , <unk> , Port Harcourt , Umuahia , Abakaliki and <unk> . 
 Before British colonial rule , the Igbo were a politically fragmented group . There were variations in culture such as in art styles , attire and religious practices . Various subgroups were organized by clan , lineage , village affiliation , and dialect . There were not many centralized chiefdoms , hereditary aristocracy , or kingship customs except in kingdoms such as those of the Nri , Arochukwu , <unk> and Onitsha . This political system changed significantly under British colonialism in the early 20th century ; Frederick Lugard introduced Eze ( kings ) into most local communities as " Warrant Chiefs " . The Igbo became overwhelmingly Christian under colonization . Chinua Achebe 's Things Fall Apart is one of the most popular novels to depict Igbo culture and changes under colonialism . 
 By the mid @-@ 20th century , the Igbo people developed a strong sense of ethnic identity . Certain conflicts with other Nigerian ethnicities led to Igbo @-@ densely populated Eastern Nigeria seceding to create the independent state of Biafra . The Nigerian Civil War or the Nigerian @-@ Biafran War ( 6 July 1967 – 15 January 1970 ) broke out shortly after . With their defeat , the Republic of Biafra once again was part of Nigeria . <unk> , a sectarian organization formed in 1999 , continues a non @-@ violent struggle for an independent Igbo state . 
 Due to the effects of migration and the Atlantic slave trade , there are descendant ethnic Igbo populations in countries such as Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea , as well as outside Africa . Their exact population outside Africa is unknown , but today many African Americans and Afro Caribbeans are of Igbo descent . According to Liberian historians the fifth president of Liberia Edward James Roye was of Igbo descent . 
 = = Identity = = 
 The Igbo people have had fragmented and politically independent communities . Before knowledge of Europeans and full exposure to other neighbouring ethnic groups , the Igbo did not have a strong identity as one people . As in the case of most ethnic groups , the British and fellow Europeans identified the Igbo as a tribe . Chinua Achebe , among other scholars , challenged this because of its negative connotations and possible wrong definition . He suggested defining the Igbo people as a nation although the Igbo do not have an officially recognized physical state of their own . 
 Due to the effects of migration and the Atlantic slave trade , there are descendant historical Igbo populations in countries such as Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea , as well as outside Africa ; many African Americans and Afro Caribbeans are believed to be partially of Igbo descent . 
 The most common name for the Igbo in English was formerly " Ibo " . They have also been known as the " Iboe " , " ' Ebo " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " , or " <unk> " . Their territory and main settlement have often also been known by their name .

 Pottery dated at around 2500 BCE showing similarities with later Igbo work was found at Nsukka , along with pottery and tools at nearby <unk> ; the traditions of the Umueri clan have as their source the Anambra valley . In the 1970s the Owerri , <unk> , Orlu , <unk> , Udi and Awka divisions were determined to constitute " an Igbo heartland " from the linguistic and cultural evidence . 
 = = = Nri Kingdom = = = 
 The Nri people of Igbo land have a creation myth which is one of the many creation myths that exist in various parts of Igbo land . The Nri and Aguleri people are in the territory of the Umueri clan who trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king @-@ figure Eri . Eri 's origins are unclear , though he has been described as a " sky being " sent by Chukwu ( God ) . He has been characterized as having first given societal order to the people of Anambra . The historian Elizabeth Allo <unk> says " Nri and Aguleri and part of the Umueri clan , [ are ] a cluster of Igbo village groups which traces its origins to a sky being called Eri . " 
 Archaeological evidence suggests that Nri hegemony in Igboland may go back as far as the 9th century , and royal burials have been unearthed dating to at least the 10th century . Eri , the god @-@ like founder of Nri , is believed to have settled the region around 948 with other related Igbo cultures following after in the 13th century . The first Eze Nri ( King of Nri ) Ìfikuánim followed directly after him . According to Igbo oral tradition , his reign started in 1043 . At least one historian puts Ìfikuánim 's reign much later , around 1225 AD . 
 Each king traces his origin back to the founding ancestor , Eri . Each king is a ritual reproduction of Eri . The initiation rite of a new king shows that the ritual process of becoming <unk> ( Nri priest @-@ king ) follows closely the path traced by the hero in establishing the Nri kingdom .

 The Kingdom of Nri was a religio @-@ polity , a sort of theocratic state , that developed in the central heartland of the Igbo region . The Nri had seven types of taboos which included human ( such as the birth of twins ) , animal ( such as killing or eating of pythons ) , object , temporal , behavioral , speech and place taboos . The rules regarding these taboos were used to educate and govern Nri 's subjects . This meant that , while certain Igbo may have lived under different formal administration , all followers of the Igbo religion had to abide by the rules of the faith and obey its representative on earth , the Eze Nri . 
 = = = Traditional society = = = 
 Traditional Igbo political organization was based on a quasi @-@ democratic republican system of government . In tight knit communities , this system guaranteed its citizens equality , as opposed to a feudalist system with a king ruling over subjects . This government system was witnessed by the Portuguese who first arrived and met with the Igbo people in the 15th century . With the exception of a few notable Igbo towns such as Onitsha , which had kings called Obi , and places like the Nri Kingdom and Arochukwu , which had priest kings ; Igbo communities and area governments were overwhelmingly ruled solely by a republican consultative assembly of the common people . Communities were usually governed and administered by a council of elders . 
 Although title holders were respected because of their accomplishments and capabilities , they were never revered as kings , but often performed special functions given to them by such assemblies . This way of governing was immensely different from most other communities of Western Africa , and only shared by the Ewe of Ghana . Umunna are a form of <unk> maintained by the Igbo . Law starts with the Umunna which is a male line of descent from a founding ancestor ( who the line is sometimes named after ) with groups of compounds containing closely related families headed by the eldest male member . The Umunna can be seen as the most important pillar of Igbo society . 
 Mathematics in indigenous Igbo society is evident in their calendar , banking system and strategic betting game called <unk> . In their indigenous calendar , a week had four days , a month consisted of seven weeks and 13 months made a year . In the last month , an extra day was added . This calendar is still used in indigenous Igbo villages and towns to determine market days . They settled law matters via mediators , and their banking system for loans and savings , called <unk> , is also still used . The Igbo new year , starting with the month Ọ ́ <unk> ́ M ̀ <unk> ́ ( Igbo : First Moon ) occurs on the third week of February , although the traditional start of the year for many Igbo communities is around springtime in Ọ ́ <unk> ́ <unk> ́ ( June ) . Used as a ceremonial script by secret societies , the Igbo have an indigenous ideographic set of symbols called Nsibidi , originating from the neighboring <unk> people . Igbo people produced bronzes from as early as the 9th century , some of which have been found at the town of Igbo Ukwu , Anambra state . 
 A system of indentured servitude existed among the Igbo before and after the encounter with Europeans . Indentured service in Igbo areas was described by Olaudah Equiano in his memoir . He describes the conditions of the slaves in his community of Essaka , and points out the difference between the treatment of slaves under the Igbo in Essaka , and those in the custody of Europeans in West Indies : 
 … but how different was their condition from that of the slaves in the West Indies ! With us , they do no more work than other members of the community , … even their master ; … ( except that they were not permitted to eat with those … free @-@ born ; ) and there was scarce any other difference between them , … Some of these slaves have … slaves under them as their own property … for their own use . 
 The Niger coast was an area of contact between African and European traders from the years 1434 – 1807 . The Portuguese were the first traders , then the Dutch and finally the British . Prior to European contact , Igbo trade routes stretched as far as Mecca , Medina and Jeddah on the continent . 
 = = = Transatlantic slave trade and diaspora = = = 
 The transatlantic slave trade , which took place between the 16th and late 19th centuries , had huge effects on the Igbo because so many young people were taken , and warfare increased for the taking of captives . Most Igbo slaves were taken from the Bight of Biafra ( also known as the Bight of Bonny ) . This area included modern day southeastern Nigeria , Western Cameroon , Equatorial Guinea and parts of Northern Gabon . Major trade ports for goods and slaves in the area included Bonny and Calabar Town . A large number of slaves from the Bight of Biafra would have been Igbo . Slaves were usually sold to Europeans by the Aro Confederacy , who kidnapped or bought slaves from Igbo villages in the hinterland . Most Igbo slaves were not victims of slave @-@ raiding wars or expeditions , but were sometimes debtors and people who committed what their communities considered to be abominations or crimes . Igbo slaves were known to the British colonists as being rebellious and having a high rate of suicide to escape slavery . For still unknown reasons , there is evidence that traders sought Igbo women . 
 Contrary to common belief , European slave traders were fairly well informed about various African ethnicities , leading to slavers ' targeting certain ethnic groups which plantation owners preferred . Particular desired ethnic groups consequently became fairly concentrated in certain parts of the Americas . The Igbo were dispersed to colonies such as Jamaica , Cuba , Saint @-@ Domingue , Barbados , the United States , Belize and Trinidad and Tobago , among others . 
 Elements of Igbo culture can still be found in these places . For example , in Jamaican Patois , the Igbo word <unk> , meaning " you " plural , is still used . " Red Ibo " ( or " red <unk> " ) describes a black person with fair or " yellowish " skin . This term had originated from the reported prevalence of these skin tones among the Igbo but eastern Nigerian influences may not be strictly Igbo . The word Bim , a colloquial term for Barbados , was commonly used among enslaved Barbadians ( <unk> ) . This word is said to have derived from <unk> in the Igbo language meaning ' my place or people ' , but may have other origins ( see : Barbados etymology ) . A section of Belize City was named <unk> Town after its Igbo inhabitants . In the United States , the Igbo were imported most commonly to the Chesapeake Bay colonies and states of Maryland and Virginia , where they constituted the largest group of Africans . Since the late 20th century , a wave of Nigerian immigrants , mostly English and Igbo @-@ speaking , have settled in Maryland , attracted to its strong professional job market . 
 = = = Colonial period = = = 
 The 19th @-@ century British colonization effort in present @-@ day Nigeria and increased encounters between the Igbo and other ethnicities near the Niger River led to a deepening sense of a distinct Igbo ethnic identity . The Igbo proved decisive and enthusiastic in their embrace of Christianity and Western education . Due to the incompatibility of the Igbo decentralized style of government and the centralized system including the appointment of warrant chiefs required for British indirect rule , British colonial rule was marked with open conflicts and much tension . Under British colonial rule , the diversity within each of Nigeria 's major ethnic groups slowly decreased and distinctions between the Igbo and other large ethnic groups , such as the Hausa and the Yoruba , became sharper . 
 Colonial rule transformed Igbo society , as portrayed in Chinua Achebe 's novel Things Fall Apart . British rule brought about changes in culture , such as the introduction of Warrant Chiefs as Eze ( indigenous rulers ) where there were no such monarchies . Christian missionaries introduced aspects of European ideology into Igbo society and culture , sometimes shunning parts of the culture . The rumours that the Igbo women were being assessed for taxation sparked off the 1929 Igbo Women 's War in Aba ( also known as the 1929 Aba Riots ) , a massive revolt of women never encountered before in Igbo history . 
 Aspects of Igbo culture such as construction of houses , education and religion changed following colonialism . The tradition of building houses out of mud walls and thatched roofs ended as the people shifted to materials such as cement blocks for houses and zinc roofs . Roads for vehicles were built . Buildings such as hospitals and schools were erected in many parts of Igboland . Along with these changes , electricity and running water were installed in the early 20th century . With electricity , new technology such as radios and televisions were adopted , and have become commonplace in most Igbo households . 
 = = = Nigerian – Biafran War = = = 
 A series of ethnic clashes between Northern Muslims and the Igbo , and other ethnic groups of Eastern Nigeria Region living in Northern Nigeria took place between 1966 and 1967 . Elements in the army had assassinated the Nigerian military head of state General Johnson <unk> @-@ <unk> ( 29 July 1966 ) and peace negotiations failed between the military government that deposed <unk> and the regional government of Eastern Nigeria at the <unk> Talks in Ghana in 1967 . These events led to a regional council of the peoples of Eastern Nigeria deciding that the region should secede and proclaim the Republic of Biafra on May 30 , 1967 . General Emeka Odumegwu @-@ Ojukwu made this declaration and became the Head of state of the new republic . The resultant war , which became known as the Nigerian Civil War or the Nigerian @-@ Biafran War , lasted from July 6 , 1967 until January 15 , 1970 , after which the federal government re @-@ absorbed Biafra into Nigeria . Several million Eastern Nigerians died from the pogroms against them , such as the 1966 anti @-@ Igbo pogrom where between 10 @,@ 000 and 30 @,@ 000 Igbo people were killed . In their struggle for self @-@ determination , the people of Biafra earned the respect of a generation , and figures such as Jean @-@ Paul Sartre and John Lennon , who returned his British honor , MBE , partly in protest against British collusion in the Nigeria @-@ Biafra war . 
 In July 2007 the former President of Biafra , General Emeka Odumegwu @-@ Ojukwu , renewed calls for the secession of the Biafran state as a sovereign entity . " The only alternative is a separate existence ... What upsets the Igbo population is we are not equally Nigerian as the others " . 
 = = = Recent history ( 1970 to present ) = = = 
 The Nigerian – Biafran War left Igboland devastated . Fighting had completely destroyed many hospitals , schools , and homes . In addition to the loss of their savings , many Igbo people faced discrimination from other ethnic groups and from the new non @-@ Igbo federal government . Some Igbo subgroups , such as the <unk> , started disassociating themselves from the larger Igbo population after the war . In the post @-@ war era , people of eastern Nigeria changed the names of both people and places to non @-@ Igbo @-@ sounding words . For instance , the town of <unk> was anglicized to <unk> . Due to discrimination , many Igbo had trouble finding employment , and during the early 1970s , the Igbo became one of the poorest ethnic groups in Nigeria . 
 Igboland was gradually rebuilt by its citizens and some contribution from the Nigerian government over a period of twenty years and the economy prospered again due to the rise of the petroleum industry in the adjacent Niger Delta region . This led to the establishment of new factories in southern Nigeria . Many Igbo people eventually took government positions , although many were engaged in private business . Since the early 21st century , there has been a wave of Nigerian Igbo immigration to other African countries , Europe , and the Americas . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Igbo culture includes the various customs , practices and traditions of the people . It comprises archaic practices as well as new concepts added into the Igbo culture either through evolution or outside influences . These customs and traditions include the Igbo people 's visual art , use of language , music and dance forms , as well as their attire , cuisine and language dialects . Because of their various subgroups , the variety of their culture is heightened further . 
 = = = Language and literature = = = 
 The Igbo language was used by John Goldsmith as an example to justify deviating from the classical linear model of phonology as laid out in The Sound Pattern of English . It is written in the Roman script as well as the Nsibidi formalized ideograms , which is used by the Ekpe society and <unk> fraternity , but is no longer widely used . Nsibidi <unk> existed among the Igbo before the 16th century , but died out after it became popular among secret societies , who made Nsibidi a secret form of communication . Igbo language is difficult because of the huge number of dialects , its richness in prefixes and suffixes and its heavy intonation . Igbo is a tonal language and there are hundreds of different Igbo dialects and Igboid languages , such as the <unk> and <unk> languages . In 1939 , Dr. Ida C. Ward led a research expedition on Igbo dialects which could possibly be used as a basis of a standard Igbo dialect , also known as Central Igbo . This dialect included that of the Owerri and Umuahia groups , including the <unk> dialect . This proposed dialect was gradually accepted by missionaries , writers , publishers , and Cambridge University . 
 In 1789 , The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano was published in London , England , written by Olaudah Equiano , a former slave . The book featured 79 Igbo words . In the first and second chapter , the book illustrates various aspects of Igbo life based on Olaudah Equiano 's life in his hometown of Essaka . Although the book was one of the first books published to include Igbo material , Geschichte der Mission der <unk> <unk> auf den <unk> <unk> St. Thomas , St. Croix und S. Jan ( German : History of the Evangelical Brothers ' Mission in the Caribbean Islands St. Thomas , St. Croix and St. John ) , published in 1777 , written by the German missionary C. G. A. <unk> , was the first book to publish any Igbo material . 
 Perhaps the most popular and renowned novel that deals with the Igbo and their traditional life was the 1959 book by Chinua Achebe , Things Fall Apart . The novel concerns influences of British colonialism and Christian missionaries on a traditional Igbo community during an unspecified time in the late nineteenth or early 20th century . Most of the novel is set in Umuofia , one of nine villages on the lower Niger . 
 = = = Performing arts = = = 
 The Igbo people have a musical style into which they incorporate various percussion instruments : the <unk> , which is essentially designed from a clay jug ; an <unk> , which is formed from a hollowed log ; and the <unk> , a hand bell designed from forged iron . Other instruments include <unk> , a wind instrument similar to the flute , <unk> , and <unk> . Another popular musical form among the Igbo is Highlife . A widely popular musical genre in West Africa , Highlife is a fusion of jazz and traditional music . The modern Igbo highlife is seen in the works of Dr Sir Warrior , Oliver De <unk> , Bright <unk> and Chief <unk> <unk> , who were among the most popular Igbo highlife musicians of the 20th century . 
 Masking is one of the most common art styles in Igboland and is linked strongly with Igbo traditional music . A mask can be made of wood or fabric , along with other materials including iron and vegetation . Masks have a variety of uses , mainly in social satires , religious rituals , secret society initiations ( such as the Ekpe society ) and public festivals , which now include Christmas time celebrations . Some of the best known include the <unk> <unk> ( Igbo : Maiden spirit ) masks of the Northern Igbo which represent the spirits of deceased maidens and their mothers with masks symbolizing beauty and Ijele . 
 Other impressive masks include Northern Igbo Ijele masks . At 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) high , Ijele masks consist of platforms 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) in diameter , supporting figures made of coloured cloth and representing everyday scenes with objects such as leopards . Ijele masks are used for honoring the dead to ensure the continuity and well @-@ being of the community and are only seen on rare occasions such as the death of a prominent figure in the community . 
 There are many Igbo dance styles , but perhaps , Igbo dance is best known for its <unk> dance troops . These performances include acrobatic stunts such as high kicks and cartwheels , with each rhythm from the indigenous instruments indicating a movement to the dancer . 
 = = = Visual art and architecture = = = 
 There is such variety among Igbo groups that it is not possible to define a general Igbo art style . Igbo art is known for various types of masquerade , masks and outfits symbolising people , animals , or abstract conceptions . Bronze castings found in the town of Igbo Ukwu from the 9th century , constitute the earliest sculptures discovered in Igboland . Here , the grave of a well @-@ established man of distinction and a ritual store , dating from the 9th century AD , contained both chased copper objects and elaborate castings of leaded bronze . Along with these bronzes were 165 @,@ 000 glass beads said to have originated in Egypt , Venice and India . Some popular Igbo art styles include Uli designs . The majority of the Igbo carve and use masks , although the function of masks vary from community to community . 
 Igbo art is noted for Mbari architecture . 
 Mbari houses of the Owerri @-@ Igbo are large opened @-@ sided square planned shelters . They house many life @-@ sized , painted figures ( sculpted in mud to appease the Alusi ( deity ) and Ala , the earth goddess , with other deities of thunder and water ) . Other sculptures are of officials , craftsmen , foreigners ( mainly Europeans ) , animals , legendary creatures and ancestors . Mbari houses take years to build in what is regarded as a sacred process . When new ones are constructed , old ones are left to decay . Everyday houses were made of mud and thatched roofs with bare earth floors with carved design doors . Some houses had elaborate designs both in the interior and exterior . These designs could include Uli art designed by Igbo women . 
 One of the unique structures of Igbo culture was the <unk> Pyramids , at the town of <unk> , in <unk> , northern Igboland . Ten pyramidal structures were built of clay / mud . The first base section was 60 ft. in circumference and 3 ft. in height . The next stack was 45 ft. in circumference . Circular stacks continued , till it reached the top . The structures were temples for the god Ala / Uto , who was believed to reside at the top . A stick was placed at the top to represent the god 's residence . The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other . Because it was built of clay / mud like the <unk> of Nubia , time has taken its toll requiring periodic reconstruction . 
 = = = Religion and rites of passage = = = 
 Today , the majority of the Igbo people are Christian , although many also retain belief in their traditional religion . Over half of the Christians are Roman Catholic . There are a small population of Igbo Jews , who claim descent from ancient Jewish traders who married their women . This claim is based on population genetics that shows Igbos has <unk> gene which is one of the original Eve genes L1 , L2 , L3 . Recent books use <unk> and paleoanthropology to demonstrate that Hebrew language was formed from Igbo language consonants . 
 The Igbo religion and traditions are known as Odinani . In Igbo religion the supreme God is called Chukwu ( " great spirit " ) ; Chukwu created the world and everything in it and is associated with all things on Earth . They believe the Cosmos is divided into four complex parts : creation , known as Okike ; supernatural forces or deities called Alusi ; <unk> , which are spirits ; and Uwa , the world . 
 Chukwu is the supreme deity in Odinani as he is the creator , and the Igbo people believe that all things come from him and that everything on earth , heaven and the rest of the spiritual world is under his control . Linguistic studies of the Igbo language suggests the name Chukwu is a compound of the Igbo words Chi ( spiritual being ) and Ukwu ( great in size ) . Each individual is born with a spiritual guide / guardian angel or guardian principle , " Chi " , unique to each individual and the individual 's fate and destiny is determined by their Chi . Thus the Igbos say that the siblings may come of the same mother but no two people have the same Chi and thus different destinies for all . Alusi , alternatively known as Arusi or <unk> ( depending on dialect ) , are minor deities that are worshiped and served in Odinani . There are many different Alusi , each with its own purpose . When an individual deity is no longer needed , or becomes too violent , it is discarded . 
 The Igbo have traditionally believed in reincarnation . People are believed to reincarnate into families that they were part of while alive . Before a relative dies , it is said that the soon to be deceased relative sometimes give clues of who they will reincarnate as in the family . Once a child is born , he or she is believed to give signs of who they have reincarnated from . This can be through behavior , physical traits and statements by the child . A diviner can help in detecting who the child has reincarnated from . It is considered an insult if a male is said to have reincarnated as a female . 
 Children are not allowed to call elders by their names without using an honorific ( as this is considered disrespectful ) . As a sign of respect , children are required to greet elders when seeing them for the first time in the day . Children usually add the Igbo honorifics Mazi or Dede before an elder 's name when addressing them . 
 = = = = Burials = = = = 
 After a death , the body of a prominent member of society is placed on a stool in a sitting posture and is clothed in the deceased 's finest garments . Animal sacrifices may be offered and the dead person is well perfumed . Burial usually follows within 24 hours of death . In the 21st century , the head of a home is usually buried within the compound of his residence . Different types of deaths warrant different types of burials . This is determined by an individual 's age , gender and status in society . For example , children are buried in hiding and out of sight ; their burials usually take place in the early mornings and late nights . A simple untitled man is buried in front of his house and a simple mother is buried in her place of origin : in a garden or a farm @-@ area that belonged to her father . In the 21st century , a majority of the Igbo bury their dead in the western way , although it is not uncommon for burials to be practiced in the traditional Igbo ways . 
 = = = = Marriage = = = = 
 The process of marrying usually involves asking the young woman 's consent , introducing the woman to the man 's family and the same for the man to the woman 's family , testing the bride 's character , checking the woman 's family background , and paying the brides ' wealth . Marriages were sometimes arranged from birth through negotiation of the two families . 
 In the past , many Igbo men practiced polygamy . The polygamous family is made up of a man and his wives and all their children . Men sometimes married multiple wives for economic reasons so as to have more people in the family , including children , to help on farms . Christian and civil marriages have changed the Igbo family since colonization . Igbo people now tend to enter monogamous courtships and create nuclear families , mainly because of Western influence . Some Western marriage customs , such as weddings in a church , take place either before or after the <unk> cultural traditional marriage .

 Traditionally , the attire of the Igbo generally consisted of little clothing , as the purpose of clothing originally was simply to conceal private <unk> body art was used to decorate both men and women in the form of lines forming patterns and shapes on the body . 
 Women traditionally carry their babies on their backs with a strip of clothing binding the two with a knot at her chest , a practice used by many ethnic groups across Africa . This method has been modernized in the form of the child carrier . Maidens usually wore a short wrapper with beads around their waist and other ornaments such as necklaces and beads . Both men and women wore wrappers . Men would wear loin cloths that wrapped round their waist and between their legs to be fastened at their back , the type of clothing appropriate for the intense heat as well as jobs such as farming . 
 In Olaudah Equiano 's narrative , Equiano describes fragrances that were used by the Igbo in the community of Essaka ; 
 " Our principal luxury is in perfumes ; one sort of these is an odoriferous wood of delicious fragrance : the other a kind of earth ; a small portion of which thrown into the fire diffuses a most powerful odor . We beat this wood into powder , and mix it with palm oil ; with which both men and women perfume themselves . " Olaudah Equiano 
 As colonialism became more influential , the Igbo adapted their dress customs . Clothing worn before colonialism became " traditional " and worn on cultural occasions . Modern Igbo traditional attire , for men , is generally made up of the <unk> top , which resembles the <unk> worn by other African groups . <unk> ( or Ishi <unk> ) is usually patterned with lions ' heads embroidered over the clothing and can be a plain colour . It is worn with trousers and can be worn with either a ceremonial title holders hat or with the conventional striped men 's hat known as <unk> Agu . For women , a puffed sleeve blouse along with two wrappers and a head tie are worn .

 The yam is very important to the Igbo as the staple crop . There are celebrations such as the New yam festival ( Igbo : <unk> ) which are held for the harvesting of the yam . During the festival , yam is eaten throughout the communities as celebration . Yam tubers are shown off by individuals as a sign of success and wealth . Rice has replaced yam for many ceremonial occasions . Other indigenous foods include cassava , <unk> , maize and plantains . Soups or stews are included in a typical meal , prepared with a vegetable ( such as okra , of which the word derives from the Igbo language , <unk> ) to which pieces of fish , chicken , beef , or goat meat are added . <unk> rice is popular throughout West Africa and Palm wine is a popular alcoholic traditional beverage .

 The Igbo in Nigeria are found in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Anambra , Benue , Cross River , <unk> , Edo , Enugu , Imo , Delta and Rivers State . The Igbo language is predominant throughout these areas , although Nigerian English ( the national language ) is spoken as well . Prominent towns and cities in Igboland include Aba , Enugu ( considered the ' Igbo capital ' ) , Onitsha , Owerri , Abakaliki , Asaba and Port Harcourt among others . A significant number of Igbo people have migrated to other parts of Nigeria , such as the cities of Lagos , Abuja , and Kano . 
 The official data on the population of ethnic groups in Nigeria continues to be controversial as a minority of these groups have claimed that the government deliberately deflates the official population of one group , to give the other numerical superiority . The CIA World Factbook puts the Igbo population of Nigeria at 18 % of a total population of 177 million , or approximately 32 million people . 
 Southeastern Nigeria , which is inhabited primarily by the Igbo , is the most densely populated area in Nigeria , and possibly in all of Africa . Most ethnicities that inhabit southeastern Nigeria , such as the closely related <unk> and Ibibio people , are sometimes regarded as Igbo by other Nigerians and ethnographers who are not well informed about the southeast .

 After the Nigerian @-@ Biafran War , many Igbo people emigrated out of the indigenous Igbo homeland in southeastern Nigeria due to an absence of federal presence , lack of jobs , and poor infrastructure . In recent decades the Igbo region of Nigeria has suffered from frequent environmental damage mainly related to the oil industry . Igbo people have moved to both Nigerian cities such as Lagos and Abuja , and other countries such as Gabon , Canada , the United Kingdom and the United States . Prominent Igbo communities outside Africa include those of London in the United Kingdom and Houston , Baltimore , Chicago , Detroit , Seattle , Atlanta and Washington , D.C. in the United States . 
 About 21 @,@ 000 Igbo people were recorded in Ghana in 1969 . A small number ( 8 @,@ 680 ) in Bioko island in 2002 . Small numbers live in Japan making up the majority of the Nigerian immigrant population based in Tokyo . A large amount of the African population of Guangdong , China , are Igbo @-@ speaking and are mainly businessmen trading between factories in China and southeastern Nigeria , particularly Enugu . Other Igbo immigrants are found in the Americas ( Igbo Canadian , Igbo American , Igbo Jamaican ) and elsewhere . 
 = = Genetics = = 
 Genetic studies have shown the Igbo to cluster most closely with other Niger @-@ Congo @-@ speaking peoples . With genealogy tracing by means of DNA testing , the roots of the African diaspora is being uncovered by descendants of the victims of the Atlantic slave trade who are researching their family history . In the 2003 PBS programme African American Lives , Bishop T.D. Jakes had his DNA analyzed ; his Y chromosome showed that he is descended from the Igbo . American actors Forest Whitaker , Paul Robeson , and Blair Underwood have traced their genealogy back to the Igbo people . 
 = = Organizations = = 
 The 1930s saw the rise of Igbo unions in the cities of Lagos and Port Harcourt . Later , the Ibo Federal Union ( renamed the Ibo State Union in 1948 ) emerged as an umbrella pan @-@ ethnic organization . Headed by Nnamdi Azikiwe , it was closely associated with the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons ( <unk> ) , which he co @-@ founded with Herbert Macaulay . The aim of the organization was the improvement and advancement ( such as in education ) of the Igbo and their indigenous land and included an Igbo " national anthem " with a plan for an Igbo bank . 
 In 1978 after Olusegun <unk> 's military regime lifted the ban on independent political activity , the <unk> Ndi Igbo organization was formed , an elite umbrella organization which speaks on behalf of the Igbo people . Their main concerns are the marginalization of the Igbo people in Nigerian politics and the neglect of indigenous Igbo territory in social amenities and development of infrastructure . Other groups which protest the perceived marginalization of the Igbo people are the Igbo Peoples Congress ( IPC ) . Even before the 20th century there were numerous Igbo unions and organizations existing around the world , such as the Igbo union in Bathurst , Gambia in 1842 , founded by a prominent Igbo trader and ex @-@ soldier named Thomas <unk> . Another was the union founded by the Igbo community in Freetown , Sierra Leone by 1860 , of which Africanus Horton , a surgeon , scientist and soldier , was an active member . 
 Decades after the Nigerian @-@ Biafran war , the Movement for the <unk> of the Sovereign State of Biafra ( <unk> ) , a secessionist group , was founded in September 1999 by Ralph <unk> for the goal of an independent Igbo state . Since its creation , there have been several conflicts between its members and the Nigerian government , resulting in the death of members . After the 2015 Nigerian general elections a group known as the Indigenous People of Biafra ( <unk> ) became the most prominent vocal group for the agitation of the creation of an independent state of Biafra through a radio station named Radio Biafra . For the promotion of the Igbo language and culture , the Society for Promoting Igbo Language and Culture ( <unk> ) was founded in 1949 by Frederick <unk> <unk> , and has since created a standard dialect for Igbo . 
 = Ann T. Bowling = 
 Ann Trommershausen Bowling ( June 1 , 1943 – December 8 , 2000 ) was one of the world 's leading geneticists in the study of horses , conducting research in the areas of molecular genetics and cytogenetics . She was a major figure in the development of testing to determine animal parentage , first with blood typing in the 1980s and then DNA testing 1990s . She later became known for her studies of hereditary diseases in horses and equine coat color genetics , as well as research on horse evolution and the development of horse breeds . She studied the population genetics of feral horses , did considerable work to help preserve the Przewalski 's horse , and was one of the founding members of the international project to map the horse genome . She was an adjunct professor at the University of California , Davis ( UCD ) , and at the time of her death in 2000 was the executive associate director of the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory ( VGL ) there . Her unexpected death on December 8 , 2000 at age 57 was attributed to a massive stroke . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Ann Bowling ( née Trommershausen ) was born June 1 , 1943 in Portland , Oregon , to Claire Bowen and William Ernest Trommershausen , who worked for the Bonneville Power Administration . After the <unk> moved to Boulder , Colorado , Bowling attended Boulder High School and was class valedictorian . She obtained her undergraduate degree at Carleton College in Minnesota , graduating magna cum laude . 
 Bowling earned her PhD in 1969 at the University of California , Davis , completing her thesis on the genetics of plants under the supervision of G. Ledyard Stebbins . She joined the faculty of Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1968 , then was hired by UC Davis in 1973 , and at the time of her death in 2000 was an adjunct professor and executive associate director of the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory ( VGL ) at UC Davis . 
 She married Michael Bowling in 1981 . Both members of the couple shared a strong interest in genetics ; prior to their marriage , Ann used Michael 's stud book research in her own 1980 study of genetic diseases . Michael Bowling wrote a number of articles on Arabian horse genetics for general @-@ interest publications , and the pair collaborated on a study of mtDNA in Arabian bloodlines . Their daughter Lydia attended veterinary school and UC Davis and became a veterinarian . 
 = = Animal parentage identification = = 
 Bowling developed some of the first blood typing and DNA parentage tests for horses , and became a genetics consultant to several horse breed registries , including The Jockey Club , Arabian Horse Association ( originally Arabian Horse Registry of America ) , American Quarter Horse Association , and the American Morgan Horse Association . Beginning in 1976 , she published research on animal blood types , and developed tests using blood type to establish parentage . She advocated for adopting blood typing for parentage verification of registered animals . Numerous breed registries did so . In the course of this research , she also studied the phenomenon of <unk> , which sometimes created inconsistent results in parentage testing . 
 By the late 1990s , as the science of parentage testing evolved , she researched the effectiveness of DNA typing and concluded that it was as effective as blood typing for verifying parentage . Her lab pioneered the DNA @-@ based parentage verification of horses and camelids — species for which Bowling herself had conducted research — using microsatellites as biomarkers . This testing program also expanded to include eight other types of mammals . 
 Bowling applied her work on identifying parentage to help preserve the genetic diversity of the Przewalski 's horse . Among other work , she reconstructed the herd book of the captive <unk> Nova herd in Ukraine using parentage testing data . She studied the genetics of Mustangs in the Great Basin and located genetic markers linking them to other domesticated horse breeds . She also performed research on the blood types of the Paso Fino breed . 
 Some of the more unusual work the VGL performed was a 1996 investigation by Scotland Yard , which sought help from the lab to identify the source of a blood sample associated with a murder . The lab identified the sample as being from a dog that was at the crime scene , and this information helped crack the case by leading investigators to a suspect who was the owner of the dog . Bowling was the director of the laboratory at the time , and as a result of this work , expanded the lab 's scope so it could continue to help identify animals present at crime scenes and those animals which themselves were victims of crimes such as theft or animal abuse . From this beginning , the VGL also later helped create a national canine database used to prosecute cases of dogfighting . Bowling also published articles on parentage in mules , including a case where she proved the rare occurrence of a fertile mule mare by parentage testing . 
 = = Genetic disease and equine coat color research = = 
 From very early in her career , Bowling wrote about educating horse breeders on genetic diseases in purebred animals and how to deal with these conditions . She performed a number of studies on the Arabian horse breed , including research into one of the genetic diseases that affects Arabians , cerebellar abiotrophy ( CA ) . In 1985 , she created a breeding herd at UCD of horses known to carry CA , and this small group provided preliminary DNA data for researchers . Bowling 's own studies of CA were unpublished at the time of her death , but she is credited with demonstrating that the condition had a recessive mode of genetic inheritance and was likely the result of a single mutated allele . A DNA marker test for the condition was developed by her successors at UCD , which became available to the public in 2008 . In 2011 , the causative mutation for cerebellar abiotrophy was identified , and the condition was conclusively established as an autosomal recessive . 
 Bowling also studied genetic conditions in other horse breeds , including <unk> periodic paralysis ( HYPP ) in the American Quarter Horse . In 1996 , her research found that the origin of this genetically dominant disorder traced to a single stallion , later identified publicly as Impressive . 
 Bowling 's study of equine coat color genetics originally coincided with her studies of animal parentage . Research related to equine coat colors dovetailed with genetic disease research when she studied overo spotting patterns seen in Paint horses . She was part of a research team that studied lethal white syndrome ( LWS ) , a fatal condition in newborn foals . She had authored an early study in 1977 that ruled out neonatal <unk> as a cause of death . In 1983 , the team linked LWS to a coat color spotting pattern , later identified as frame overo , which is seen in the American Paint Horse and related breeds . In 1997 Bowling was one of three researchers to identify the gene responsible for LWS , and in the process identified the condition as the equine version of Hirschsprung disease . 
 While researching lethal white syndrome , Bowling also studied the phenomenon of <unk> ; spotted offspring born from two minimally @-@ marked parents . She also worked with the team that mapped the cream gene , which is a dilution gene with no deleterious effects , though a misconception exists that cream colors might be linked to lethal white syndrome . 
 In addition to her work on deleterious mutations associated with horse genetics , Bowling studied genetic disorders in the Australian shepherd dog that appeared to be linked to the merle coat color .

 In the 1990s , Bowling was one of the leaders in the horse genome project . This work was also important to human medicine , as there are at least 90 genetic conditions that can affect both humans and horses . The horse genome was first sequenced in 2006 , and was fully mapped by 2009 . 
 = = Horse breeding = = 
 Bowling owned Arabian horses , and was a co @-@ founder of the New Albion Stud along with her husband Michael and her parents , Bill and Claire Trommershausen . Ann and her parents had owned half @-@ Arabians when they lived in Colorado ; Michael Bowling had owned Arabians since 1962 . They started the farm in September 1980 , about the same time that Ann and Michael married , and placed an emphasis on bloodlines descended from the Crabbet Arabian Stud . The farm continued to be operated by her husband and daughter after Bowling 's death . Bowling 's study of mitochondrial DNA in Arabians found that pedigree records kept by the American registry for Arabian horses were generally reliable from the time of importation forward . But her work also brought into question a belief commonly held by Arabian breeders that horses imported from the desert identified by specific historic dam lines or " strains " in their pedigrees actually traced to specific matrilineal groups . Bowling also found that some mare lines claimed to originate from the same desert @-@ bred " strain " were not related at all , and some mares whose pedigrees claimed they were of different strains turned out to be distantly related .

 # 1 to Infinity is the sixth compilation album by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey . It was released by Sony Music Entertainment on May 15 , 2015 . It features Carey 's eighteen U.S. number @-@ one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 . A new recording called " Infinity " was released as the only single on April 27 , 2015 . In January 2015 , the singer announced that she had signed a residency deal to perform at The Colosseum at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas in May and July 2015 , and would perform all of her number @-@ ones . As a result , she decided to re @-@ release her first compilation , # 1 's , from 1998 with an updated list of subsequent chart toppers . Carey promoted the album with her Mariah Carey # 1 's residency and with live performances at the Billboard Music Awards , Jimmy Kimmel Live ! and Live ! with Kelly and Michael .

 Following the release of Mariah Carey 's fourteenth studio album , Me . I Am Mariah … The Elusive Chanteuse , in May 2014 , she parted ways with her record label Def Jam Recordings , her publicist Cindi Berger and her manager Jermaine Dupri . She signed a new record contract with L.A. Reid at Epic Records ( who co @-@ executively produced Carey 's tenth album The Emancipation of Mimi in 2005 ) , sought a new publicist with Chris Chambers of the Chamber Group and hired new managers Stella <unk> and Brian Sher . Writers Shirley Halperin and Andrew Hampp of Billboard attributed Carey 's decision to seek new a new label and management to the low sales of Me . I Am Mariah … The Elusive Chanteuse , which at a total of 117 @,@ 000 units since its release , is Carey 's lowest selling album in the United States . Carey secured a multi @-@ album record deal with Epic in January 2015 , a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment , meaning that # 1 to Infinity would be her first album since her seventh studio album Rainbow in 1999 to be released with Sony . 
 Following the release of Rainbow , Carey left Sony and signed an $ 80 million , four @-@ album contract with EMI 's Virgin Records , wishing to severe all ties with Sony and its chairman , her former husband Tommy Mottola . Halperin and Hampp believe that following a prolonged period of absence from Sony and re @-@ signing with them is a positive situation for Carey : " Doug Morris , current chairman / CEO of Sony Music , brought Carey to Island Def Jam in 2003 when he was running Universal Music Group . Reid , then head of Island Def Jam , oversaw her Mimi @-@ powered 2005 comeback . Joey <unk> , a collaborator of Carey 's during the making of the six @-@ times platinum [ The Emancipation of Mimi ] , is now executive vp A & R at Epic . " Furthermore , Carey released seven studio albums , a live EP and four compilation / greatest hits albums with Sony , which have sold a total of 43 @.@ 9 million units in the US combined . Although Halperin and Hampp note that " Carey 's legacy is undisputed , her recent stumbles have not gone unnoticed , " with regard to her divorce from Nick Cannon , the low sales of Me . I Am Mariah … The Elusive Chanteuse and its failure to garner a top @-@ ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 and hiring and firing three managers : Dupri , Randy Jackson and Kevin Giles ( the last of whom Carey has kept as a consultant ) . As a result , several record labels were reluctant to offer Carey a contract . According to Billboard , many other critics felt that reuniting with Reid is Carey 's best chance of re @-@ establishing herself on the charts .

 In January 2015 , Carey announced that she would re @-@ release # 1 's ( 1998 ) with an updated version featuring her songs that had in the meantime reached number @-@ one : " Heartbreaker " featuring Jay @-@ Z ( 1999 ) , " Thank God I Found You " featuring Joe and 98 Degrees ( 2000 ) , " We Belong Together " ( 2005 ) , " Don 't Forget About Us " ( 2005 / 06 ) and " Touch My Body " ( 2008 ) . The North American track listing of # 1 to Infinity features Carey 's eighteen U.S. number @-@ one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and one new recording called " Infinity " . Instead of including the original studio version of her third number @-@ one " Someday " ( 1991 ) , the live recording from her MTV Unplugged EP ( 1992 ) features instead . Carey explains in the liner notes of # 1 to Infinity that she felt the studio version was overproduced . The Bad Boy Fantasy remix of her ninth number @-@ one " Fantasy " featuring Ol ' Dirty Bastard was included instead of the original solo version . Carey describes the remix as a " turning point " in her career . 
 " Someday " , " I Don 't Wanna Cry " and " Thank God I Found You " were omitted from the international track listing . They were replaced with Carey 's cover of Badfinger 's song " Without You " ( number @-@ one in New Zealand , the United Kingdom , and several European territories ) , her " Endless Love " duet with Luther Vandross ( number @-@ one in New Zealand ) and " Against All Odds " featuring Westlife ( number @-@ one in the United Kingdom ) . " Thank God I Found You " was also omitted from the Japanese track listing , and replaced with " All I Want for Christmas Is You " . For the album artwork , Carey launched a social media campaign on April 12 , 2015 , whereby fans had to share a link to her website in order to reveal the cover which was concealed by a curtain . Using the hashtag " <unk> " , the more shares the link received , the quicker the cover was revealed . Fans unlocked the final image a day later on April 13 .

 " Infinity " was released as the only single from the album , and was the only new recording to be included on the track list . It is a mid @-@ tempo R & B song written by Carey , Eric Hudson , Priscilla Renea , Taylor Parks and Ilsey Juber . Lyrically , the song is about Carey freeing herself and emancipation , however many critics speculated that the lyrics were specifically about her separation from her second husband , Nick Cannon . In response , Carey said that the song was not a reflection of her personal life , but even if it was , she would not publicly confirm who it was written about . Critical response to the song was positive , with many critics praising Carey 's vocals and her comical songwriting , specifically with regard to the reference about Fritos . " Infinity " reached number 82 on the Billboard Hot 100 , becoming her forty @-@ seventh entry since her debut in 1990 .

 = Prostitution of children = 
 Prostitution of children or child prostitution is prostitution involving a child , and it is a form of commercial sexual exploitation of children . The term normally refers to prostitution of a minor , or person under the legal age of consent . In most jurisdictions , child prostitution is illegal as part of a general prohibition on prostitution . 
 Prostitution of children usually manifests in the form of sex trafficking , in which a child is kidnapped or duped into becoming involved in the sex trade , or " survival sex " , in which the child engages in sexual activities to procure basic essentials such as food and shelter . Prostitution of children is commonly associated with child pornography , and they often overlap . Some people travel to foreign countries to engage in child sex tourism . Research suggests that there may be as many as 10 million children involved in prostitution worldwide . The problem is most severe in South America and Asia , but prostitution of children exists globally , in undeveloped countries as well as developed . Most of the children involved with prostitution are girls , despite an increase in the number of young boys in the trade . 
 The United Nations has declared the prostitution of children to be illegal under international law , and various campaigns and organizations have been created to protest its existence . 
 " Most of the victimized children who face prostitution are vulnerable children who are exploited . Many predators target runaways , sexual assault victims , and children who have been harshly neglected by their biological parents . Not only have they faced traumatic violence that affects their physical being , but become intertwined into the violent life of prostitution . " – U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole . 
 = = Definitions = = 
 Several definitions have been proposed for prostitution of children . The United Nations defines it as " the act of engaging or offering the services of a child to perform sexual acts for money or other consideration with that person or any other person " . The Convention on the Rights of the Child 's Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children , Child Prostitution , and Child Pornography defines the practice as " the act of obtaining , procuring or offering the services of a child or inducing a child to perform sexual acts for any form of compensation or reward " . Both emphasize that the child is a victim of exploitation , even if apparent consent is given . The Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention , 1999 , ( Convention No 182 ) of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) describes it as the " use , procuring or offering of a child for prostitution " . 
 According to the International Labour Office in Geneva , prostitution of children and child pornography are two primary forms of child sexual exploitation , which often overlap . The former is sometimes used to describe the wider concept of commercial sexual exploitation of children ( CSEC ) . It excludes other identifiable manifestations of CSEC , such as commercial sexual exploitation through child marriage , domestic child labor , and the trafficking of children for sexual purposes . 
 The terminology applied to the practice is a subject of dispute . The United States Department of Justice states , " The term itself implies the idea of choice , when in fact that is not the case . " Groups that oppose the practice believe that the terms " child prostitution " and " child prostitute " carry problematic connotations because children are generally not expected to be able to make informed decisions about prostitution . As an alternative , they use the terms " prostituted children " and " the commercial sexual exploitation of children " . Other groups use the term " child sex worker " to imply that the children are not always " passive victims " . 
 = = Causes and types = = 
 Children are often forced by social structures and individual agents into situations in which adults take advantage of their vulnerability and sexually exploit and abuse them . Structure and agency commonly combine to force a child into commercial sex : for example , the prostitution of a child frequently follows from prior sexual abuse , often in the child 's home . Many believe that the majority of prostituted children are from Southeast Asia and the majority of their clients are Western sex tourists , but sociologist Louise Brown argues that , while Westerners contribute to the growth of the industry , most of the children 's customers are Asian locals . 
 Prostitution of children usually occurs in environments such as brothels , bars and clubs , homes , or particular streets and areas ( usually in socially run down places ) . According to one study , only about 10 % of prostituted children have a pimp and over 45 % entered the business through friends . Maureen Jaffe and Sonia Rosen from the International Child Labor Study Office write that cases vary widely : " Some victims are runaways from home or State institutions , others are sold by their parents or forced or tricked into prostitution , and others are street children . Some are amateurs and others professionals . Although one tends to think first and foremost of young girls in the trade , there is an increase in the number of young boys involved in prostitution . The most disquieting cases are those children who are forced into the trade and then incarcerated . These children run the possible further risk of torture and subsequent death . " 
 = = = Human trafficking = = = 
 Human trafficking is defined by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) as " the recruitment , transport , transfer , harbouring or receipt of a person by such means as threat or use of force or other forms of coercion , of abduction , of fraud or deception for the purpose of exploitation " . The UNODC approximates the number of victims worldwide to be around 2 @.@ 5 million . UNICEF reports that since 1982 about 30 million children have been trafficked . Trafficking for sexual slavery accounts for 79 % of cases , with the majority of victims being female , of which an estimated 20 % are children . Women are also often perpetrators as well . 
 In 2007 the UN founded United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking ( UN.GIFT ) . In cooperation with UNICEF , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , and the United Nations Development Fund for Women ( <unk> ) the United Nations took a grant from the United Arab Emirates to establish <unk> UN.GIFT aims to fight human trafficking through a mutual support from its stakeholders which includes governments , businesses , and other large global actors . There first initiative is to spread the word that human trafficking is immoral and has become a growing problem that it will take a global cooperation to cease its continuation . UN.GIFT strives to lower the demand for this exploitation and create a safe environment for potential victims . 
 In some cases , victims of sex trafficking are kidnapped by strangers , either by force or by being tricked into becoming involved through lies and false promises . In other cases , the children 's families allow or force them to enter the industry as a result of severe poverty . In cases where they are taken out of the country , traffickers prey on the fact that the children are often unable to understand the language of their new location and are unaware of their legal rights . 
 Research indicates that traffickers have a preference for females age 12 and under because young children are more easily molded into the role assigned to them and because they are assumed to be virgins , which is valuable to consumers . The girls are then made to appear older , and documents are forged as protection against law enforcement . Victims tend to share similar backgrounds , often coming from communities with high crime rates and lack of access to education . However , <unk> is not limited to this , and males and females coming from various backgrounds have become involved in sex trafficking . 
 <unk> Mary De <unk> identifies five stages in the process of sex trafficking : vulnerability , recruitment , transportation , exploitation , and liberation . The final stage , De <unk> writes , is rarely completed . Murder and accidental death rates are high , as are suicides , and very few trafficking victims are rescued or escape . 
 Sex trafficking is a lucrative business due to the low risk and high demand for its existence . The return of high profits acts as a primary incentive driving the spread of human trafficking . Today , most markets are operated online disguised as salon parlors making it harder to enforce sex trafficking laws . Examples are online escort services , residential brothels , brothels disguised as massage businesses or spas , many of which enslave children to their services . 
 = = = Survival sex = = = 
 The other primary form of prostitution of children is " survival sex " . The US Department of Justice states : 
 " Survival sex " occurs when a child engages in sex acts in order to obtain money , food , shelter , clothing , or other items needed in order to survive . In these situations , the transaction typically only involves the child and the customer ; children engaged in survival sex are usually not controlled or directed by pimps , madams , or other traffickers . Any individual who pays for sex with a child , whether the child is controlled by a pimp or is engaged in survival sex , can be prosecuted . 
 A study commissioned by UNICEF and Save the Children and headed by sociologist <unk> <unk> conducted research on prostitution of children in post @-@ war Bosnia and Herzegovina . <unk> reported that poverty was a strong contributing factor . She stated , " The global sex trade is as much a product of everyday people struggling to survive in dire economic straits as it is an organized crime problem . Attacking the crime and not the poverty is treating the symptom but not the disease ... It 's not uncommon for girls to know what they 're entering into , and to enter voluntarily to some degree . Maybe they think they 'll be different and able to escape , or maybe they 'd rather take the risk than feel powerless staying at home in poverty . " Jaffe and Rosen disagree and argue that poverty alone does not often force children into prostitution , as it does not exist in a large scale in several impoverished societies . Rather , a number of external influences , such as poor family situations and domestic violence , factor into the problem . 
 Prostitution of children in the form of survival sex occurs in both undeveloped and developed countries . In Asia , underage girls sometimes work in brothels to support their families . In Sri Lanka parents will more often have their sons prostitute themselves rather than their daughters , as the society places more weight on sexual purity among females than males . Jaffe and Rosen write that prostitution of children in North America often results from " economic considerations , domestic violence and abuse , family disintegration and drug addiction " . In Canada , a young man was convicted of charges relating to the prostitution of a 15 @-@ year @-@ old girl online in 2012 ; he had encouraged her to prostitute herself as a means of making money , kept all of her earnings , and threatened her with violence if she did not continue .

 <unk> children are often forced to work in hazardous environments without proper hygiene . They face threats of violence and are sometimes raped and beaten . Researchers Robin E. Clark , Judith Freeman Clark , and Christine A. <unk> write that they " suffer a great deal of abuse , unhappiness , and poor health " in general . For example , Derrick Jensen reports that female sex trafficking victims from Nepal are " ' broken in ' through a process of rapes and beatings , and then rented out up to thirty @-@ five times per night for one to two dollars per man " . Another example involved mostly Nepalese boys who were lured to India and sold to brothels in Mumbai , Hyderabad , New Delhi , Lucknow , and Gorakhpur . One victim left Nepal at the age of 14 and was sold into slavery , locked up , beaten , starved , and forcibly circumcised . He reported that he was held in a brothel with 40 to 50 other boys , many of whom were castrated , before escaping and returning to Nepal . 
 Criminologist Ronald Flowers writes that prostitution of children and child pornography are closely linked ; up to one in three prostituted children have been involved in pornography , often through films or literature . Runaway teenagers , he states , are frequently used for " porn flicks " and photographs . In addition to pornography , Flowers writes that , " Children caught up in this dual world of sexual exploitation are often victims of sexual assaults , sexual perversions , sexually transmitted diseases , and inescapable memories of sexual misuse and bodies that have been compromised , brutalized , and left forever tarnished . "

 According to <unk> , an NGO that opposes the prostitution of children , the practice causes injuries such as " vaginal tearing , physical after @-@ effects of torture , pain , infection , or unwanted pregnancy " . As clients seldom take precautions against the spread of HIV , prostituted children face a high risk of contracting the disease , and the majority of them in certain locations contract it . Other sexually transmitted diseases pose a threat as well , such as syphilis and herpes . High levels of tuberculosis have also been found among prostituted children . These illnesses are often fatal . 
 Former prostituted children often deal with psychological trauma , including depression and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Other psychological effects include anger , insomnia , sexual and personality confusion , inability to trust adults , and loss of confidence . Drug @-@ related health problems included dental problems , hepatitis B and C , and serious liver and kidney problems . Other medical complications included reproductive problems and injuries from sexual assaults ; physical and neurological problems from violent physical attacks ; and other general health issues including respiratory problems and joint pains .

 Prostitution of children is illegal under international law , and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , Article 34 , states , " the State shall protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse , including prostitution and involvement in pornography . " The convention was first held in 1989 and has been ratified by 193 countries . In 1990 , the United Nations appointed a Special Rapporteur on the sale of children , child prostitution , and child pornography . While the legality of adult prostitution varies between different parts of the world , the prostitution of minors is illegal in most countries , and all countries have some form of restrictions against it . 
 There is a dispute surrounding what constitutes a prostituted child . International law defines a child as any individual below the age of 18 , but a number of countries legally recognize lower ages of consent and adulthood , usually ranging from 13 to 17 years of age . Thus , law enforcement officers are sometimes hesitant to investigate cases because of the differences in age of consent . The laws of some countries do , however , distinguish between prostituted teenagers and prostituted children . For example , the Japanese government defines the category as referring to minors between 13 and 18 . 
 Consequences for offenders vary from country to country . In the People 's Republic of China , all forms of prostitution are illegal , but having sexual contact with anyone under the age of 14 , regardless of consent , will result in a more serious punishment than raping an adult . In the United States , the legal penalty for participating in the prostitution of children includes five to twenty years in prison . The FBI established " Innocence Lost " , a new department working to free children from prostitution , in response to the strong public reaction across the country to the news of Operation Stormy Nights , in which 23 minors were released from forced prostitution . 
 = = Prevalence = = 
 Prostitution of children exists in every country , though the problem is most severe in South America and Asia . The number of prostituted children is rising in other parts of the world , including North America , Africa , and Europe . Exact statistics are difficult to obtain , but it is estimated that there are around 10 million children involved in prostitution worldwide . 
 Note : this is a list of examples ; it does not cover every country where child prostitution exists . 
 By 1999 , it was reported that in Argentina prostitution of children was increasing at an alarming rate and that the average age was decreasing . The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women ( <unk> ) fact book says Argentina is one of the favored destinations of pedophile sex tourists from Europe and the United States . Argentina 's Criminal Code criminalizes the prostitution of minors of eighteen years of age or younger , but it only sanctions those who " promote or facilitate " prostitution , not the client who exploits the minor .

 Anthropologist Heather Montgomery writes that society has a largely negative perception of prostitution of children , in part because the children are often viewed as having been abandoned or sold by their parents and families . The International Labour Organization includes the prostitution of children in its list of the " worst forms of child labour " . At the 1996 World Congress Against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children it was called " a crime against humanity " , " torture " , and " slavery " . Virginia Kendall , a district judge and expert on child exploitation and human trafficking , and T. Markus Funk , an attorney and law professor , write that the subject is an emotional one and that there are various perspectives about its prevention : 
 The topic of proscribing and punishing child exploitation triggers intense emotions . While there is general consensus that child sexual exploitation , whether through the Internet , forced prostitution , the international or domestic trafficking of children for sex , or molestation , is on the rise , observers in the United States and elsewhere find little common ground on the questions of how serious such conduct is , or what , if anything , must be done to address it . 
 Investigative journalist Julian Sher states that widespread stereotypes about the prostitution of children continued into the 1990s , when the first organized opposition arose and police officers began working to dispel common misconceptions . Criminologist Roger Matthews writes that concerns over pedophilia and child sexual abuse , as well as shifting perceptions of youth , led the public to see a sharp difference between prostitution of children and adult prostitution . While the latter is generally frowned upon , the former is seen as intolerable . Additionally , he states , children are increasingly viewed as " innocent " and " pure " and their prostitution as paramount to slavery . Through the shift in attitude , the public began to see minors involved in the sex trade as victims rather than as perpetrators of a crime , needing rehabilitation rather than punishment .

 Though campaigns against prostitution of children originated in the 1800s , the first mass protests against the practice occurred in the 1990s in the United States , led largely by <unk> ( End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism ) . The group , which historian Junius P. Rodriguez describes as " the most significant of the campaigning groups against child prostitution " , originally focused on the issue of children being exploited in Southeast Asia by Western tourists . Women 's rights groups and anti @-@ tourism groups joined to protest the practice of sex tourism in Bangkok , Thailand . The opposition to sex tourism was spurred on by an image of a Thai youth in prostitution , published in Time and by the publication of a dictionary in the United Kingdom describing Bangkok as " a place where there are a lot of prostitutes " . Cultural anthropologists Susan Dewey and Patty Kelly write that though they were unable to inhibit sex tourism and rates of prostitution of children continued to rise , the groups " galvanized public opinion nationally and internationally " and succeeded in getting the media to cover the topic extensively for the first time . <unk> later expanded its focus to protest child prostitution globally . 
 The late 1990s and early 2000s also saw the creation of a number of shelters and rehabilitation programs for prostituted children , and the police began to actively investigate the issue . The National Human Trafficking Resource Center ( <unk> ) was later established by the Polaris Project as a national , toll @-@ free hotline , available to answer calls from anywhere in the United States , 24 hours a day , seven days a week , every day of the year . Operated by Polaris Project , the hotline was designed to allow callers to report tips and receive information on human trafficking . 
 The opposition to prostitution of children and sexual slavery spread to Europe and elsewhere , and organizations pushed for prostituted children to be recognized as victims rather than offenders . The issue remained prominent in the following years , and various campaigns and organizations continued into the 2000s and 2010s . 
 = = History = = 
 Prostitution of children dates to antiquity . <unk> boys were commonly prostituted in brothels in ancient Greece and Rome . According to Ronald Flowers , the " most beautiful and highest born Egyptian maidens were forced into prostitution ... and they continued as prostitutes until their first menstruation . " Chinese and Indian children were commonly sold by their parents into prostitution . Parents in India sometimes dedicated their female children to the Hindu temples , where they became " devadasis " . Traditionally a high status in society , the devadasis were originally tasked with maintaining and cleaning the temples of the Hindu deity to which they were assigned ( usually the goddess Renuka ) and learning skills such as music and dancing . However , as the system evolved , their role became that of a temple prostitute , and the girls , who were " dedicated " before puberty , were required to prostitute themselves to upper class men . The practice has since been outlawed but still exists . 
 In Europe , child prostitution flourished until the late 1800s ; minors accounted for 50 % of individuals involved in prostitution in Paris . A scandal in 19th @-@ century England caused the government there to raise the age of consent . In July 1885 , William Thomas Stead , editor of the Pall Mall Gazette , published " The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon " , four articles describing an extensive underground sex trafficking ring that reportedly sold children to adults . Stead 's reports focused on a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl , Eliza Armstrong , who was sold for £ 5 ( the equivalent of around £ 500 in 2012 ) , then taken to a midwife to have her virginity verified . The age of consent was raised from 13 to 16 within a week of publication . During this period , the term white slavery came to be used throughout Europe and the United States to describe prostituted children . 
 = Bismuth = 
 Bismuth is a chemical element with the symbol Bi and the atomic number 83 . Bismuth , a pentavalent post @-@ transition metal , chemically resembles arsenic and antimony . Elemental bismuth may occur naturally , although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores . The free element is 86 % as dense as lead . It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced , but is often seen in air with a pink tinge owing to surface oxidation . Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic element , and has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity among metals . 
 Bismuth metal has been known since ancient times , although it was often confused with lead and tin , which share some physical properties . The etymology is uncertain , but possibly comes from Arabic bi <unk> , meaning having the properties of antimony or German words weiße Masse or <unk> ( " white mass " ) , translated in the mid @-@ sixteenth century to New Latin <unk> . 
 Bismuth has long been considered the element with the highest atomic mass that is stable . However , in 2003 it was discovered to be weakly radioactive : its only primordial isotope , bismuth @-@ 209 , decays via alpha decay with a half life more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe . 
 Bismuth compounds account for about half the production of bismuth . They are used in cosmetics , pigments , and a few pharmaceuticals , notably bismuth subsalicylate , used to treat diarrhea . Bismuth 's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses , such as in casting of printing type . Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal . As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years , there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys ( presently about a third of bismuth production ) as a replacement for lead . 
 = = History = = 
 The name bismuth is from ca . 1660s , and is of uncertain etymology . It is one of the first 10 metals to have been discovered . Bismuth appears in the 1660s , from obsolete German Bismuth , <unk> , <unk> ( early 16th century ) ; perhaps related to Old High German <unk> ( " white " ) . The New Latin <unk> ( due to Georgius Agricola , who Latinized many German mining and technical words ) is from the German <unk> , perhaps from weiße Masse , " white mass " . The element was confused in early times with tin and lead because of its resemblance to those elements . Bismuth has been known since ancient times , so no one person is credited with its discovery . Agricola , in De Natura <unk> ( ca . 1546 ) states that bismuth is a distinct metal in a family of metals including tin and lead . This was based on observation of the metals and their physical properties . Miners in the age of alchemy also gave bismuth the name tectum <unk> , or " silver being made , " in the sense of silver still in the process of being formed within the Earth . 
 Beginning with Johann Heinrich Pott in 1738 , Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Torbern Olof Bergman , the distinctness of lead and bismuth became clear , and Claude François Geoffroy demonstrated in 1753 that this metal is distinct from lead and tin . Bismuth was also known to the Incas and used ( along with the usual copper and tin ) in a special bronze alloy for knives .

 Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white , silver @-@ pink hue , often occurring in its native form , with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue . The spiral , stair @-@ stepped structure of bismuth crystals is the result of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges . The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection , thus displaying a rainbow of colors . When burned in oxygen , bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes . Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table , such as lead , antimony , and polonium . 
 No other metal is verified to be more naturally diamagnetic than bismuth . ( <unk> is a different physical phenomenon . ) Of any metal , it has one of the lowest values of thermal conductivity ( after manganese , and maybe neptunium and plutonium ) and the highest Hall coefficient . It has a high electrical resistance . When deposited in sufficiently thin layers on a substrate , bismuth is a semiconductor , despite being a post @-@ transition metal . 
 Elemental bismuth is denser in the liquid phase than the solid , a characteristic it shares with antimony , germanium , silicon and gallium . Bismuth expands 3 @.@ 32 % on solidification ; therefore , it was long a component of low @-@ melting typesetting alloys , where it compensated for the contraction of the other alloying components , to form almost isostatic bismuth @-@ lead eutectic alloys . 
 Though virtually unseen in nature , high @-@ purity bismuth can form distinctive , colorful hopper crystals . It is relatively nontoxic and has a low melting point just above 271 ° C , so crystals may be grown using a household stove , although the resulting crystals will tend to be lower quality than lab @-@ grown crystals . 
 At ambient conditions bismuth shares the same layered structure as the metallic forms of arsenic and antimony , crystallizing in the rhombohedral lattice ( Pearson symbol <unk> , space group <unk> No. 166 ) , which is often classed into trigonal or hexagonal crystal systems . When compressed at room temperature , this Bi @-@ I structure changes first to the monoclinic Bi @-@ II at 2 @.@ 55 GPa , then to the tetragonal Bi @-@ III at 2 @.@ 7 GPa , and finally to the body @-@ centered cubic Bi @-@ IV at 7 @.@ 7 GPa . The corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical conductivity ; they are rather reproducible and abrupt , and are therefore used for calibration of high @-@ pressure equipment .

 It reacts with fluorine to make bismuth ( V ) fluoride at 500 ° C or bismuth ( III ) fluoride at lower temperatures ( typically from Bi melts ) ; with other halogens it yields only bismuth ( III ) halides . The trihalides are corrosive and easily react with moisture , forming oxyhalides with the formula <unk> .

 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 The only primordial isotope of bismuth , bismuth @-@ 209 , was traditionally regarded as the heaviest stable isotope , but it had long been suspected to be unstable on theoretical grounds . This was finally demonstrated in 2003 , when researchers at the Institut d <unk> <unk> in Orsay , France , measured the alpha emission half @-@ life of 209Bi to be 1 @.@ 9 × 1019 years , over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe . Owing to its extraordinarily long half @-@ life , for all presently known medical and industrial applications , bismuth can be treated as if it is stable and nonradioactive . The radioactivity is of academic interest because bismuth is one of few elements whose radioactivity was suspected and theoretically predicted before being detected in the laboratory . Bismuth has the longest known alpha decay half @-@ life , although tellurium @-@ 128 has a double beta decay half @-@ life of over 2 @.@ 2 × 1024 years . 
 Several isotopes of bismuth with short half @-@ lives occur within the radioactive disintegration chains of actinium , radium , and thorium , and more have been synthesized experimentally . Bismuth @-@ 213 is also found on the decay chain of uranium @-@ 233 . 
 Commercially , the radioactive isotope bismuth @-@ 213 can be produced by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator . In 1997 , an antibody conjugate with bismuth @-@ 213 , which has a 45 @-@ minute half @-@ life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle , was used to treat patients with leukemia . This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment , for example , in the targeted alpha therapy ( TAT ) program .
