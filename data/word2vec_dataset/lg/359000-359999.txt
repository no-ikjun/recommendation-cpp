 In his relations with them , Sayf al @-@ Dawla befitted from the fact that he was an ethnic Arab , unlike most of the contemporary rulers in the Islamic Middle East , who were Turkish or Iranian warlords who had risen from the ranks of the military slaves ( ghilman ) . This helped him win support among the Arab tribes , and the bedouins played a prominent role in his administration . However , in accordance with the usual late Abbasid practice familiar to Sayf al @-@ Dawla and common across the Muslim states of the Middle East , the Hamdanid state was heavily reliant on and increasingly dominated by its non @-@ Arab , mostly Turkish , ghilman . This is most evident in the composition of his army , which , alongside Arab tribal cavalry , made heavy use of Daylamites as infantry and Turks as horse archers . 
 After winning recognition by the Ikhshidids , Sayf al @-@ Dawla began a series of campaigns of consolidation . His main target was to establish firm control over the Syrian littoral , as well as the routes connecting it to the interior . The operations there included a difficult siege of the fortress of <unk> in 947 – 948 , which was held by a Kurdish brigand leader , who from there controlled the lower Orontes valley . In central Syria , a Qarmatian @-@ inspired revolt of the Kalb and Tayyi erupted in late 949 , led by a certain Ibn <unk> al @-@ <unk> . The rebels enjoyed initial success , even capturing the Hamdanid governor of Homs , but they were quickly crushed . In the north , the attempts of the Hamdanid administrators to keep the bedouin from interfering with the more settled Arab communities resulted in regular outbreaks of rebellion between 950 and 954 , which had to be suppressed by Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's army . 
 Finally , in 955 a major rebellion broke out which involved all tribes , both bedouin and sedentary , including the Hamdanids ' close allies , the Kilab . Sayf al @-@ Dawla was able to resolve the situation quickly , initiating a ruthless campaign of swift repression that included driving the tribes into the desert to die or capitulate , coupled with diplomacy that played on the divisions among the tribesmen . Thus the Kilab were offered peace and a return to their favoured status , and were given additional lands at the expense of the Kalb , who were evicted from their homes along with the Tayyi and fled south to settle in the plains north of Damascus and the Golan Heights , respectively . At the same time , the <unk> were also expelled and encouraged to resettle in the Jazira around Harran . 
 The suppression of the great tribal revolt marked , in the words of Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy , " the high point of Sayf al @-@ Dawla ’ s success and power " . For a short time , during that year , his suzerainty was also acknowledged in parts of Azerbaijan around Salmas , where the Kurd <unk> established brief control until evicted and finally captured by Marzuban ibn Muhammad . 
 = = = Wars with the Byzantines = = = 
 Through his assumption of control over the Syrian and Jaziran borderlands ( the Thughur ) with Byzantium in 945 / 946 , Sayf al @-@ Dawla emerged as the chief Arab prince facing the Byzantine Empire , and warfare with the Byzantines became his main preoccupation . Indeed , much of Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's reputation stems from his unceasing , though ultimately unsuccessful war with the Empire . 
 By the early 10th century , the Byzantines had gained the upper hand over their eastern Muslim neighbours . The onset of decline in the Abbasid Caliphate after 861 ( the " Anarchy at Samarra " ) was followed by the Battle of Lalakaon in 863 , which had broken the power of the border emirate of Malatya and marked the beginning the gradual Byzantine encroachment on the Arab borderlands . Although the emirate of Tarsus in Cilicia remained strong and Malatya continued to resist Byzantine attacks , over the next half @-@ century the Byzantines managed to overwhelm the Paulician allies of Malatya and advance to the Upper Euphrates , occupying the mountains north of the city . Finally , after 927 , peace on their Balkan frontier enabled the Byzantines , under John Kourkouas , to turn their forces east and begin a series of campaigns that culminated in the fall and annexation of Malatya in 934 , an event which sent shock @-@ waves among the other Muslim emirates . Arsamosata followed in 940 , and Qaliqala ( Byzantine Theodosiopolis , modern Erzurum ) in 949 . 
 The Byzantine advance evoked a great emotional response in the Muslim world , with volunteers , both soldiers and civilians , flocking to participate in the jihad against the Empire . Sayf al @-@ Dawla was also affected by this atmosphere , and became deeply impregnated with the spirit of jihad . The rise of the Hamdanid brothers to power in the frontier provinces and the Jazira is therefore to be regarded against the backdrop of the Byzantine threat , as well as the manifest inability of the Abbasid government to stem the Byzantine offensive . In Hugh Kennedy 's words , " compared with the inaction or indifference of other Muslim rulers , it is not surprising that Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's popular reputation remained high ; he was the one man who attempted to defend the Faith , the essential hero of the time " . 
 = = = = Early campaigns = = = = 
 Sayf al @-@ Dawla entered the fray against the Byzantines in 936 , when he led an expedition to the aid of Samosata , at the time besieged by the Byzantines . A revolt in his rear forced him to abandon the campaign , and he only managed to send a few supplies to the town , which fell soon after . In 938 , he raided the region around Malatya and captured the Byzantine fort of <unk> . Some Arab sources report a major victory over Kourkouas himself , but the Byzantine advance does not seem to have been affected . His most important campaign in these early years was in 939 – 940 , when he invaded southwestern Armenia and secured a pledge of allegiance and the surrender of a few fortresses from the local princes — the Muslim <unk> of Manzikert and the Christian <unk> of Taron and Gagik Artsruni of Vaspurakan — who had begun defecting to Byzantium , before turning west and raiding Byzantine territory up to Koloneia . This expedition temporarily broke the Byzantine leaguer around Qaliqala , but Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's preoccupation with his brother 's wars in Iraq over the next years meant that it was not followed up . This was a major missed chance ; as the historian Mark Whittow comments , a more sustained policy could have made use of the Armenian princes ' distrust of Byzantine expansionism , to form a network of clients and contain the Byzantines . Instead , the latter were given a free hand , which allowed them to press on and capture Qaliqala , cementing their dominance over the region . 
 = = = = Failures and victories , 945 – 955 = = = = 
 After establishing himself at Aleppo in 944 , Sayf al @-@ Dawla resumed warfare against Byzantium in 945 / 946 . From this time until the time of his death , he was the Byzantines ' chief antagonist in the East — by the end of his life Sayf al @-@ Dawla was said to have fought against them in over forty battles . Nevertheless , despite his frequent and destructive raids against the Byzantine frontier provinces and into Asia Minor , and his victories in the field , his mode of warfare was essentially defensive , and he never seriously attempted to challenge Byzantine control of the crucial mountain passes or conclude alliances with other local rulers in an effort to roll back the Byzantine conquests . Compared to Byzantium , Sayf al @-@ Dawla was the ruler of a minor principality , and could not match the means and numbers available to the resurgent Empire : the contemporary Arab sources report — with obvious , but nonetheless indicative , exaggeration — that Byzantine armies numbered up to 200 @,@ 000 , while Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's largest force numbered some 30 @,@ 000 . Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's origin in the Jazira also affected his strategic outlook in that , contrary to most Syria @-@ based polities in history , he neglected constructing a fleet or paying any attention at all to the Mediterranean . 
 Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's raid of winter 945 / 946 was of limited scale , and was followed by a prisoner exchange . Warfare on the frontiers then died down for a couple of years , and recommenced only in 948 . Despite scoring a victory over a Byzantine invasion in 948 , he was unable to prevent the sack of Hadath , one of the main Muslim strongholds in the Euphrates Thughur , by Leo Phokas , one of the sons of the Byzantine Domestic of the Schools ( commander @-@ in @-@ chief ) Bardas Phokas . Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's expeditions in the next two years were also failures . In 949 he raided into the theme of Lykandos but was driven back , and the Byzantines proceeded to sack Marash , defeat a <unk> army and raid as far as Antioch . In the next year , Sayf al @-@ Dawla led a large force into Byzantine territory , ravaging the themes of Lykandos and Charsianon , but on his return he was ambushed by Leo Phokas in a mountain pass . In what became known as the <unk> al @-@ <unk> , the " dreadful expedition " , Sayf al @-@ Dawla lost 8 @,@ 000 men and barely escaped himself . 
 Sayf al @-@ Dawla nevertheless rejected offers of peace from the Byzantines , and launched another raid against Lykandos and Malatya , persisting until the onset of winter forced him to retire . In the next year , he concentrated his attention on rebuilding the fortresses of Cilicia and northern Syria , including Marash and Hadath . Bardas Phokas launched an expedition to obstruct these works , but was defeated . Bardas launched another campaign in 953 , but despite having a considerably larger force at his disposal , he was heavily defeated near Marash in a battle celebrated by Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's panegyrists . The Byzantine commander even lost his youngest son , Constantine , to Hamdanid captivity . Another expedition led by Bardas in the next year was also defeated , allowing Sayf al @-@ Dawla to complete the re @-@ fortification of Samosata and Hadath . The latter successfully withstood yet another Byzantine attack in 955 . 
 = = = = Byzantine ascendancy , 956 – 962 = = = = 
 Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's victories brought about the replacement of Bardas by his eldest son , Nikephoros Phokas . Blessed with capable subordinates like his brother Leo and his nephew John Tzimiskes , Nikephoros would bring about a reversal of fortunes in Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's struggle with the Byzantines . The young general also benefited from the culmination of military reforms that created a more professional army . 
 In spring 956 , Sayf al @-@ Dawla pre @-@ empted Tzimiskes from a planned assault on Amida , and invaded Byzantine territory first . Tzimiskes then seized a pass in Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's rear , and attacked him during his return . The hard @-@ fought battle , fought amidst torrential rainfall , resulted in a Muslim victory as Tzimiskes lost 4 @,@ 000 men . At the same time , however , Leo Phokas invaded Syria and defeated and captured Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's cousin Abu <unk> ' Asa 'ir , whom he had left behind in his stead . Later in the year , Sayf al @-@ Dawla was obliged to go to Tarsus to help repel a raid by the Byzantine Cibyrrhaeot fleet . In 957 , Nikephoros took and razed Hadath , but Sayf al @-@ Dawla was unable to react as he discovered a conspiracy by some of his officers to surrender him to the Byzantines in exchange for money . Sayf al @-@ Dawla executed 180 of his ghilman and mutilated over 200 others in retaliation . In the next spring , Tzimiskes invaded the Jazira , captured Dara , and scored a victory at Amida over an army of 10 @,@ 000 led by one of Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's favourite lieutenants , the Circassian Nadja . Together with the parakoimomenos Basil Lekapenos , he then stormed Samosata , and even inflicted a heavy defeat on a relief army under Sayf al @-@ Dawla himself . The Byzantines exploited Hamdanid weakness , and in 959 Leo Phokas led a raid as far as <unk> , sacking several forts on their way . 
 In 960 , Sayf al @-@ Dawla tried to use the absence of Nikephoros Phokas with much of his army on his Cretan expedition , to re @-@ establish his position . At the head of a large army , he invaded Byzantine territory and sacked the fortress of Charsianon . On his return , however , his army was attacked and almost annihilated in an ambush by Leo Phokas and his troops . Once again , Sayf al @-@ Dawla managed to escape , but his military power was broken . The local governors now began to make terms with the Byzantines on their own , and the Hamdanid 's authority was increasingly questioned even in his own capital . Sayf al @-@ Dawla now needed time , but as soon as Nikephoros Phokas returned victorious from Crete in summer 961 , he began preparations for his next campaign in the east . The Byzantines launched their attack in the winter months , catching the Arabs off guard . They captured Anazarbus in Cilicia , and followed a deliberate policy of devastation and massacre to drive the Muslim population away . After Nikephoros repaired to Byzantine territory to celebrate Easter , Sayf al @-@ Dawla entered Cilicia and claimed direct control over the province . He began to rebuild Anazarbus , but the work was left incomplete when Nikephoros recommenced his offensive in autumn , forcing Sayf al @-@ Dawla to depart the region . The Byzantines , with an army reportedly 70 @,@ 000 strong , proceeded to take Marash , <unk> , <unk> and Manbij , thereby securing the western passes over the Anti @-@ Taurus Mountains . Sayf al @-@ Dawla sent his army north under Nadja to meet the Byzantines , but Nikephoros ignored them . Instead , the Byzantine general led his troops south and in mid @-@ December , they suddenly appeared before Aleppo . After defeating an improvised army before the city walls , the Byzantines stormed the city and plundered it , except for the citadel , which continued to hold out . The Byzantines departed , taking some 10 @,@ 000 inhabitants , mostly young men , with them as captives . Returning to his ruined and half @-@ deserted capital , Sayf al @-@ Dawla repopulated it with refugees from Qinnasrin . 
 = = = Illness , rebellions and death = = = 
 In 963 , the Byzantines remained quiet as Nikephoros was scheming to ascend the imperial throne , but Sayf al @-@ Dawla was troubled by the onset of hemiplegia as well as worsening intestinal and urinary disorders , which henceforth confined him to a litter . The disease limited Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's ability to intervene personally in the affairs of his state ; he soon abandoned Aleppo to the charge of his chamberlain , Qarquya , and spent most of his final years in Mayyafariqin , leaving his senior ghilman to carry the burden of warfare against the Byzantines and the various rebellions that sprung up in his domains . Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's physical decline , coupled with his military failures , especially the capture of Aleppo in 962 , meant that his authority became increasingly shaky among his subordinates , for whom military success was the prerequisite for political legitimacy . 
 Thus , in 961 , the emir of Tarsus , Ibn az @-@ Zayyat , unsuccessfully tried to turn over his province to the Abbasids . In 963 , his nephew , the governor of Harran , Hibat Allah , rebelled after killing Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's trusted Christian secretary in favour of his father , Nasir al @-@ Dawla . Nadja was sent to subdue the rebellion , forcing Hibat Allah to flee to his father 's court , but then Nadja himself rebelled and attacked Mayyafariqin , defended by Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's wife , with the intention of turning it over to the Buyids . He failed , and retreated to Armenia , where he managed to take over a few fortresses around Lake Van . In autumn 964 he again attempted to take Mayyafariqin , but was obliged to abandon it to subdue a revolt in his new Armenian domains . Sayf al @-@ Dawla himself travelled to Armenia to meet his former lieutenant . Nadja re @-@ submitted to his authority without resistance , but was murdered in winter 965 at Mayyafariqin , probably at the behest of Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's wife . 
 Nevertheless , despite his illness and the spreading famine in his domains , in 963 Sayf al @-@ Dawla launched three raids into Asia Minor . One of them even reached as far as Iconium , but Tzimiskes , named Nikephoros ' successor as Domestic of the East , responded by launching an invasion of Cilicia in winter . He destroyed an Arab army at the " Field of Blood " near Adana , and unsuccessfully besieged Mopsuestia before lack of supplies forced him to return home . In autumn 964 , Nikephoros , now emperor , again campaigned in the East , and met little resistance . Mopsuestia was besieged but held out , until the famine that plagued the province forced the Byzantines to withdraw . Nikephoros however returned in the next year and stormed the city and deported its inhabitants . On 16 August 965 , Tarsus was surrendered by its inhabitants , who secured safe passage to Antioch . Cilicia became Byzantine province , and Nikephoros proceeded to re @-@ Christianize it . 
 The year 965 also saw two further large @-@ scale rebellions within Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's domains . The first was led by a former governor of the coast , the ex @-@ Qarmatian Marwan al- ' Uqayli , which grew to threatening dimensions : the rebels captured Homs , defeated an army sent against them and advanced up to Aleppo , but Al- ' Uqayli was wounded in the battle for the city and died shortly after . In autumn , a more serious revolt broke out in Antioch , led by the former governor of Tarsus , Rashiq ibn Abdallah al @-@ <unk> . The rebellion was obviously motivated by Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's inability to stop the Byzantine advance . After raising an army in the town , Rashiq led it to besiege Aleppo , which was defended by Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's ghilman , <unk> and Bishara . Three months into the siege , the rebels had taken possession of part of the lower town , when Rashiq was killed . He was succeeded by a Daylamite named Dizbar . Dizbar defeated Qarquya and took Aleppo , but then departed the town to take control over the rest of northern Syria . In the same year , Sayf al @-@ Dawla was also heavily affected by the death of two of his sons , Abu 'l @-@ <unk> and Abu 'l @-@ <unk> . 
 In early 966 , Sayf al @-@ Dawla asked for and received a short truce and an exchange of prisoners with the Byzantines , which was held at Samosata . He ransomed many Muslim captives at great cost , only to see them go over to Dizbar 's forces . Sayf al @-@ Dawla resolved to confront the rebel : carried on his litter , he returned to Aleppo , and on the next day defeated the rebel 's army , helped by the defection of the Banu Kilab from Dizbar 's army . The surviving rebels were ruthlessly punished . However , Sayf al @-@ Dawla was still unable to confront Nikephoros when he resumed his advance . The Hamdanid ruler fled to the safety of the fortress of Shayzar while the Byzantines raided the Jazira , before turning on northern Syria , where they launched attacks on Manbij , Aleppo and even Antioch , whose newly appointed governor , Taki al @-@ Din Muhammad ibn Musa , went over to them with the city 's treasury . In early February 967 , Sayf al @-@ Dawla returned to Aleppo , where he died a few days later ( although a source claims that he died at Mayyafariqin ) . His body was embalmed and buried at a mausoleum in Mayyafariqin beside his mother and sister . A brick made of dust collected from his armour after his campaigns was reportedly placed under his head . He was succeeded by his only surviving son ( by his cousin Sakhinah ) , the fifteen @-@ year @-@ old Abu 'l @-@ Ma 'ali Sharif , better known as Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla . Sa 'd al @-@ <unk> 's reign was marked by internal turmoil , and it was not until 977 that he was able to secure control of his own capital . By this time , the rump emirate was almost powerless and became a bone of contention between the Byzantines and the new power of the Middle East , the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt . 
 = = Cultural activity and legacy = = 
 Sayf al @-@ Dawla surrounded himself with prominent intellectual figures , most notably the great poets al @-@ Mutanabbi and Abu Firas , the preacher Ibn <unk> , the grammarian Ibn <unk> , and the noted philosopher al @-@ Farabi . Al @-@ Mutanabbi 's time at the court of Sayf al @-@ Dawla was arguably the pinnacle of his career as poet . During his nine years at Aleppo , al @-@ Mutanabbi wrote 22 major panegyrics to Sayf al @-@ Dawla , which , according to the Arabist Margaret Larkin , " demonstrated a measure of real affection mixed with the conventional praise of premodern Arabic poetry . " The celebrated historian and poet , Abu al @-@ Faraj al @-@ Isfahani , was also part of the Hamdanid court , and dedicated his major encyclopedia of poetry and songs , Kitab al @-@ <unk> , to Sayf al @-@ Dawla . Abu Firas was Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's cousin and had been raised at his court , while Sayf al @-@ Dawla had married his sister Sakhinah and appointed him governor of Manbij and Harran . Abi Firas accompanied Sayf al @-@ Dawla on his wars against the Byzantines and was taken prisoner twice . It was during his second captivity in 962 – 966 that he wrote his famous <unk> ( " Roman " , i.e. Byzantine ) poems . Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's patronage of poets had a useful political dividend too : it was part of a court poet 's duty to his patron to celebrate him in his work , and poetry helped spread the influence of Sayf al @-@ Dawla and his court far across the Muslim world . If Sayf al @-@ Dawla paid special favour to poets , his court contained scholars versed in religious studies , history , philosophy and astronomy as well , so that , as S. Humphreys comments , " in his time Aleppo could certainly have held its own with any court in Renaissance Italy " . 
 Sayf al @-@ Dawla was also unusual for 10th @-@ century Syria in his espousal of Twelver Shi 'a Islam in a hitherto solidly Sunni country . During his reign , the founder of the Alawite sect , al @-@ <unk> , benefited from Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's patronage . Al @-@ <unk> turned Aleppo into the stable centre of his new sect , and sent preachers from there as far as Persia and Egypt with his teachings . His main theological work , Kitab al @-@ <unk> al @-@ <unk> , was dedicated to his Hamdanid patron . Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's active promotion of Shi 'ism began a process whereby Syria came to host a large Shi 'a population by the 12th century . 
 In addition , Sayf al @-@ Dawla played a crucial role in the history of the two cities he chose as his capitals , Aleppo and Mayyafariqin . His choice raised them from obscurity to the status of major urban centres ; Sayf al @-@ Dawla lavished attention on them , endowing them with new buildings , as well as taking care of their fortification . Aleppo especially benefited from Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's patronage : of special note is the great palace of <unk> outside Aleppo , as well as the gardens and aqueduct which he built there . Aleppo 's rise to the chief city in northern Syria dates from his reign . 
 = = Political legacy = = 
 Sayf al @-@ Dawla has remained to this day one of the best @-@ known medieval Arab leaders . His bravery and leadership of the war against the Byzantines , despite the heavy odds against him , his literary activities and patronage of poets which lent his court an unmatched cultural brilliance , the calamities which struck him towards his end — defeat , illness and betrayal — have made him , in the words of Th . Bianquis , " from his time until the present day " , the personification of the " Arab chivalrous ideal in its most tragic aspect " . 
 Nevertheless , the picture presented by his contemporaries on the impact of Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's policies is less favourable : the 10th @-@ century chronicler Ibn Hawqal , who travelled the Hamdanid domains , paints a dismal picture of economic oppression and exploitation of the common people , linked with the Hamdanid practice of expropriating extensive estates in the most fertile areas and practising a monoculture of cereals destined to feed the growing population of Baghdad . This was coupled with heavy taxation — Sayf al @-@ Dawla and Nasir al @-@ Dawla are said to have become the wealthiest princes in the Muslim world — which allowed them to maintain their lavish courts , but at a heavy price to their subjects ' long @-@ term prosperity . According to Hugh Kennedy " even the capital of Aleppo seems to have been more prosperous under the following Mirdasid dynasty than under the Hamdanids " , while Bianquis claims that Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's wars and economic policies both contributed to a permanent alteration in the landscape of the regions they ruled : " by destroying orchards and peri @-@ urban market gardens , by enfeebling the once vibrant <unk> and by depopulating the <unk> steppe terrain of the frontiers , the Hamdanids contributed to the erosion of the deforested land and to the seizure by semi @-@ nomadic tribes of the agricultural lands of these regions in the 11th century " . 
 His military record was also , in the end , one of failure : the Byzantine advance continued after his death , culminating in the fall of Antioch in 969 . Aleppo was transformed into a vassal state tributary to Byzantium , and for the next fifty years it would become the bone of contention between the Byzantines and a new Muslim power , the Egypt @-@ based Fatimid Caliphate . The Hamdanids ' military defeat was in the end inevitable , given the disparity of strength and resources with the Empire . This weakness was compounded by the failure of Nasir al @-@ Dawla to support his brother in his wars against Byzantium , by the Hamdanids ' preoccupation with internal revolts , and the feebleness of their authority over much of their domains . As the historian Mark Whittow comments , Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's martial reputation often masks the reality that his power was " a paper tiger , short of money , short of soldiers and with little real base in the territories he controlled " . 
 = Italian battleship Leonardo da Vinci = 
 Leonardo da Vinci was one of three Conte di Cavour @-@ class dreadnoughts built for the Regia Marina ( Italian Royal Navy ) in the early 1910s . Completed just before the beginning of World War I , the ship saw no action and was sunk by a magazine explosion in 1916 with the loss of 248 officers and enlisted men . The Italians blamed Austro @-@ Hungarian saboteurs for her loss , but it may have been accidental . Leonardo da Vinci was refloated in 1919 and plans were made to repair her . Budgetary constraints did not permit this and her hulk was sold for scrap in 1923 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Leonardo da Vinci was 168 @.@ 9 meters ( 554 ft 2 in ) long at the waterline , and 176 meters ( 577 ft 5 in ) overall . The ship had a beam of 28 meters ( 91 ft 10 in ) , and a draft of 9 @.@ 3 meters ( 30 ft 6 in ) . She displaced 23 @,@ 088 long tons ( 23 @,@ 458 t ) at normal load , and 25 @,@ 086 long tons ( 25 @,@ 489 t ) at deep load . The Conte di Cavour @-@ class dreadnoughts had a complete double bottom and their hull was subdivided by 23 longitudinal and transverse bulkheads . They had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men . 
 The ship 's machinery consisted of four Parsons steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft . Steam for the turbines was provided by 20 Blechynden water @-@ tube boilers , eight of which burned oil and twelve of which burned both fuel oil and coal . Designed to reach a maximum speed of 22 @.@ 5 knots ( 41 @.@ 7 km / h ; 25 @.@ 9 mph ) from 31 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 23 @,@ 000 kW ) , Leonardo da Vinci failed to reach this goal on her sea trials , despite generally exceeding the rated power of her turbines . The ship only made a maximum speed of 21 @.@ 6 knots ( 40 @.@ 0 km / h ; 24 @.@ 9 mph ) using 32 @,@ 800 shp ( 24 @,@ 500 kW ) . The ship could store a maximum of 1 @,@ 450 long tons ( 1 @,@ 470 t ) of coal and 850 long tons ( 860 t ) of oil that gave her a range of 4 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ; 5 @,@ 500 mi ) at 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) , and 1 @,@ 000 nmi ( 1 @,@ 900 km ; 1 @,@ 200 mi ) at 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Leonardo da Vinci 's main armament consisted of thirteen 46 @-@ caliber 305 @-@ millimeter guns , in five gun turrets . The turrets were arranged all on the centerline , with a twin @-@ gun turret superfiring over a triple @-@ gun turret in fore and aft pairs , and a third triple turret amidships . These were designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' Q ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from bow to stern . The turrets had an elevation capability of − 5 / + 20 degrees and the ship could carry 100 rounds for each gun , although 70 was the normal load . Sources disagree regarding these guns ' performance , but naval historian Giorgio Giorgerini claims that they fired 452 @-@ kilogram ( 996 lb ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) projectiles at the rate of one round per minute and that they had a muzzle velocity of 840 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 800 ft / s ) which gave a maximum range of 24 @,@ 000 meters ( 26 @,@ 000 yd ) . 
 The secondary armament consisted of eighteen 50 @-@ caliber 120 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull . These guns could depress to − 10 degrees and had a maximum elevation of + 15 degrees ; they had a rate of fire of six shots per minute . They could fire a 22 @.@ 1 @-@ kilogram ( 49 lb ) high @-@ explosive projectile with a muzzle velocity of 850 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 800 ft / s ) to a maximum distance of 12 @,@ 000 yards ( 11 @,@ 000 m ) . The ship carried a total of 3 @,@ 600 rounds for them . For defense against torpedo boats , Leonardo da Vinci carried fourteen 50 @-@ caliber 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns ; thirteen of these could be mounted on the turret tops , but they could be mounted in 30 different positions , including some on the forecastle and upper decks . These guns had the same range of elevation as the secondary guns , although their rate of fire was higher at 10 rounds per minute . They fired a 6 @-@ kilogram ( 13 lb ) AP projectile with a muzzle velocity of 815 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 670 ft / s ) to a maximum distance of 10 @,@ 000 yards ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) . The ships were also fitted with three submerged 45 @-@ centimeter ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , one on each broadside and the third in the stern . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The Conte di Cavour @-@ class ships had a complete waterline armor belt that was 2 @.@ 8 meters ( 9 ft 2 in ) high ; 1 @.@ 6 meters ( 5 ft 3 in ) of this was below the waterline and 1 @.@ 2 meters ( 3 ft 11 in ) above . It had a maximum thickness of 250 millimeters ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) amidships , reducing to 130 millimeters ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) towards the stern and 80 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) towards the bow . The lower edge of this belt was a uniform 170 millimeters ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) in thickness . Above the main belt was a strake of armor 220 millimeters ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) thick that extended 2 @.@ 3 meters ( 7 ft 7 in ) up to the lower edge of the main deck . Above this strake was a thinner one , 130 millimeters thick , that extended 138 meters ( 452 ft 9 in ) from the bow to ' X ' turret . The upper strake of armor protected the casemates and was 110 millimeters ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) thick . The ships had two armored decks : the main deck was 24 mm ( 0 @.@ 94 in ) thick in two layers on the flat that increased to 40 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) on the slopes that connected it to the main belt . The second deck was 30 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick , also in two layers . Fore and aft transverse bulkheads connected the armored belt to the decks . 
 The frontal armor of the gun turrets was 280 millimeters ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) in thickness with 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) sides , and an 85 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 3 in ) roof and rear . Their barbettes also had 230 @-@ millimeter armor above the forecastle deck that reduced to 180 millimeters ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) between the forecastle and upper decks and 130 millimeters below the upper deck . The forward conning tower had walls 280 millimeters thick those of the aft conning tower were 180 millimeters thick .

 Leonardo da Vinci , named after the artist and inventor , was built by the Odero Shipbuilding Co . , at their Sestri Ponente , Genoa shipyard . She was laid down on 18 July 1910 , launched on 14 October 1911 , and completed on 17 May 1914 . The ship saw no combat during the war and spent most of it at anchor . She capsized in Taranto harbor , in 11 metres ( 36 ft ) of water , after an internal magazine explosion on the night of 2 / 3 August 1916 while loading ammunition . Casualties included 21 officers and 227 enlisted men . The subsequent investigation blamed Austro @-@ Hungarian saboteurs , but unstable propellant may well have been responsible . 
 The Regia Marina wanted to raise the ship and rejected initial plans to demolish the wreck with explosives . They ultimately settled on a plan to make the ship 's hull airtight and raise it using compressed air and pontoons . This required that the ship 's coal , ammunition , and gun turrets be removed or cut loose , respectively , by divers to reduce her weight . A further complication was that the largest drydock in Taranto had a maximum depth of only 12 @.@ 2 metres ( 40 ft ) and the upside @-@ down Leonardo da Vinci drew 15 @.@ 2 metres ( 50 ft ) . This meant that her funnels had to be cut off as well . 
 All of this preparation required over two years and the ship was refloated on 17 September 1919 . A deep channel had been dredged from her location to the drydock and she was moved there . A special wooden framework had to be built to support her , still inverted , after the water in the drydock had been drained . Her decks were not designed to handle the stresses involved in her unique situation and had to be reinforced to withstand the weight of the hull and preliminary repairs were made in preparation for righting her . A deep spot in the harbor was dredged for this task and some 400 long tons ( 410 t ) of ballast were added in spots calculated to assist in the righting effort . The primary work was done by 7 @,@ 500 long tons ( 7 @,@ 600 t ) of water pumped into the ship 's starboard side and she was successfully righted on 24 January 1921 . The Regia Marina planned to modernize Leonardo da Vinci by replacing her center turret with six 102 @-@ millimeter ( 4 in ) AA guns , but ultimately lacked the funds to do so and sold her for scrap on 22 March 1923 .

 The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess ( Japanese : ゼルダの伝説 <unk> , Hepburn : Zeruda no Densetsu : <unk> <unk> ) is an action @-@ adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube and Wii home video game consoles . It is the thirteenth installment in the The Legend of Zelda series . Originally planned for release on the GameCube in November 2005 , Twilight Princess was delayed by Nintendo to allow its developers to refine the game , add more content , and port it to the Wii . The Wii version was released alongside the console in North America in November 2006 , and in Japan , Europe , and Australia the following month . The GameCube version was released worldwide in December 2006 . 
 The story focuses on series protagonist Link , who tries to prevent Hyrule from being engulfed by a corrupted parallel dimension known as the Twilight Realm . To do so , he takes the form of both a Hylian and a wolf , and is assisted by a mysterious creature named Midna . The game takes place hundreds of years after Ocarina of Time and Majora 's Mask , in an alternate timeline from The Wind Waker . 
 At the time of its release , Twilight Princess was considered the greatest entry in the Zelda series by many critics , including writers for 1UP.com , Computer and Video Games , Electronic Gaming Monthly , Game Informer , GamesRadar , IGN , and The Washington Post . It received several Game of the Year awards , and was the most critically acclaimed game of 2006 . As of September 2015 , 8 @.@ 85 million copies of the game have been sold worldwide , making it the best @-@ selling title in the series . In 2011 , the Wii version was rereleased under the Nintendo Selects label . A high @-@ definition remaster for the Wii U , The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess HD , was released in March 2016 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess is an action @-@ adventure game focused on combat , exploration , and puzzle @-@ solving . It uses the basic control scheme introduced in Ocarina of Time , including context @-@ sensitive action buttons and L @-@ targeting ( Z @-@ targeting on the Wii ) , a system that allows the player to keep Link 's view focused on an enemy or important object while moving and attacking . Link can walk , run , and attack , and will automatically jump when running off of or reaching for a ledge . Link uses a sword and shield in combat , complemented with secondary weapons and items , including a bow and arrows , a boomerang , and bombs . While L @-@ targeting , projectile @-@ based weapons can be fired at a target without the need for manual aiming . 
 The context @-@ sensitive button mechanic allows one button to serve a variety of functions , such as talking , opening doors , and pushing , pulling , and throwing objects . The on @-@ screen display shows what action , if any , the button will trigger , determined by the situation . For example , if Link is holding a rock , the context @-@ sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy , or place the rock on the ground if he is standing still . 
 The GameCube and Wii versions feature several minor differences in their controls . The Wii version of the game makes use of the motion sensors and built @-@ in speaker of the Wii Remote . The speaker emits the sounds of a bowstring when shooting an arrow , Midna 's laugh when she gives advice to Link , and the series ' trademark " chime " when discovering secrets . The player controls Link 's sword by swinging the Wii Remote . Other attacks are triggered using similar gestures with the Nunchuk . Unique to the GameCube version is the ability for the player to control the camera freely , without entering a special " <unk> " mode required by the Wii ; however , in the GameCube version , only two of Link 's secondary weapons can be equipped at a time , as opposed to four in the Wii version . 
 The game features nine dungeons — large , contained areas where Link battles enemies , collects items , and solves puzzles . Link navigates these dungeons and fights a boss at the end in order to obtain an item or otherwise advance the plot . The dungeons are connected by a large overworld , across which Link can travel on foot ; on his horse , Epona ; or by teleporting with Midna 's assistance . 
 When Link enters the Twilight Realm , the void that corrupts parts of Hyrule , he transforms into a wolf . He is eventually able to transform between his Hylian and wolf forms at will . As a wolf , Link loses the ability to use his sword , shield , or any secondary items ; he instead attacks by biting and defends primarily by dodging attacks . However , " Wolf Link " gains several key advantages in return — he moves faster than he does as a human ( though riding Epona is still faster ) and digs holes to create new passages and uncover buried items , and has improved senses , including the ability to follow scent trails . He also carries Midna , a small imp @-@ like creature who gives him hints , uses an energy field to attack enemies , helps him jump long distances , and eventually allows him to " warp " to any of several preset locations throughout the overworld . Using Link 's wolf senses , the player can see and listen to the wandering spirits of those affected by the Twilight , as well as hunt for enemy ghosts named <unk> . 
 The artificial intelligence ( AI ) of enemies in Twilight Princess is more advanced than that of enemies in The Wind Waker . Enemies react to defeated companions and to arrows or slingshot pellets that pass by , and can detect Link from a greater distance than was possible in previous games . 
 There is very little voice acting in the game , as is the case in most The Legend of Zelda titles to date . Link remains silent in conversation , but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised . His emotions and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions . Other characters have similar language @-@ independent <unk> , including laughter , surprised or fearful exclamations , and screams . Midna has the most voice acting — her on @-@ screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo @-@ speech , which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko <unk> .

 Twilight Princess takes place several centuries after Ocarina of Time and Majora 's Mask . The game begins with a youth named Link , who is working as a ranch hand in Ordon Village . One day , the village is attacked by <unk> , who carry off the village 's children with Link in pursuit before he encounters a wall of Twilight . A Shadow Beast pulls him beyond the wall into the Twilight @-@ shrouded forest , where he is transformed into a wolf and imprisoned . Link is soon freed by an imp @-@ like Twilight creature named Midna , who offers to help him if he obeys her unconditionally . She guides him to Princess Zelda , who explains that Zant , the King of the Twilight , infiltrated Hyrule Castle and forced her to surrender . The conquered kingdom was enveloped in Twilight , rendering all its inhabitants besides Link and Zelda spirits . In order to save Hyrule , Link must first revive the Light Spirits by entering the Twilight @-@ covered regions and , as a wolf , recovering the Spirits ' light from the Twilight beings that stole it . Once revitalized , each Spirit returns Link to his Hylian form . 
 During this time , Link also helps Midna acquire the Fused Shadows , fragments of a relic containing powerful dark magic . In return , she aids Link in rescuing Ordon Village 's children and assisting the monkeys of Faron , the Gorons of Eldin , and the Zoras of Lanayru . After restoring the Light Spirits and obtaining the Fused Shadows , Link and Midna are ambushed by Zant , who relieves Midna of the fragments . She ridicules him for abusing his tribe 's magic , but Zant reveals that his power comes from another source as he uses it to revert Link to his wolf state . Failing to seduce Midna into joining forces with him , Zant leaves her to die from the world 's light . Upon bringing a dying Midna to Zelda , Link learns he needs the Master Sword to lift Zant 's curse . Zelda sacrifices herself to heal Midna with her power before vanishing mysteriously . Moved by Zelda 's selflessness , Midna begins to care more about Link and the fate of the light world . 
 After gaining the Master Sword , Link is cleansed of the curse that kept him in wolf form . Deep within the Gerudo Desert , Link and Midna locate the Mirror of Twilight , the only known gateway between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm , but discover it is broken . The Sages there explain that Zant tried to destroy it , but merely managed to shatter it into fragments ; only the true ruler of the <unk> can completely destroy the Mirror of Twilight . They also relate that they once used it to banish Ganondorf , the Gerudo tribe leader who attempted to steal the Triforce , to the Twilight Realm when executing him failed . Link and Midna set out to retrieve the missing shards of the Mirror . Once the portal has been restored , the Sages reveal to Link that Midna is the true ruler of the Twilight Realm , usurped by Zant when he cursed her into her current form . Confronting Zant , Link and Midna learn that Zant 's coup was made possible when he forged a pact with Ganondorf , who asked for Zant 's assistance in subjugating Hyrule . After Link defeats Zant , Midna recovers the Fused Shadows and destroys Zant after learning that only Ganondorf 's death can release her from her curse . 
 Returning to Hyrule , Link and Midna find Ganondorf in Hyrule Castle , with a lifeless Zelda suspended above his head . Ganondorf fights Link by possessing Zelda 's body and by transforming into a massive boar @-@ like beast , but Link defeats him and Midna is able to resuscitate Zelda . Ganondorf then revives , and Midna teleports Link and Zelda outside the castle so she can hold him off with the Fused Shadows . However , as Hyrule Castle collapses , it is revealed that Ganondorf was victorious as he crushes Midna 's helmet . Ganondorf engages Link on horseback ; assisted by Zelda and the Light Spirits , Link eventually knocks Ganondorf off his horse and they duel on foot before Link strikes down Ganondorf and plunges the Master Sword into his chest . With Ganondorf dead , the Light Spirits revivify Midna and restore her to her true form . After bidding farewell to Link and Zelda , Midna returns home and destroys the Mirror of Twilight with a tear to maintain balance between Hyrule and the Twilight Realm . As Hyrule Castle is rebuilt , Link leaves Ordon Village , heading to parts unknown .

 In 2003 , Nintendo announced that a new The Legend of Zelda game was in the works for the GameCube by the same team that had created the cel @-@ shaded The Wind Waker . At the following year 's Game Developers Conference , director Eiji Aonuma unintentionally revealed that the game 's sequel was in development under the working title The Wind Waker 2 ; it was set to use a similar graphical style to that of its predecessor . Nintendo of America told Aonuma that North American sales of The Wind Waker were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that the game was designed for a young audience . Concerned that the sequel would have the same problem , Aonuma expressed to producer Shigeru Miyamoto that he wanted to create a realistic Zelda game that would appeal to the North American market . Miyamoto , hesitant about solely changing the game 's presentation , suggested the team 's focus should instead be on coming up with gameplay innovations . He advised that Aonuma should start by doing what could not be done in Ocarina of Time , particularly horseback combat . 
 In four months , Aonuma 's team managed to present realistic horseback riding , which Nintendo later revealed to the public with a trailer at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2004 . The game was scheduled to be released the next year , and was no longer a follow @-@ up to The Wind Waker ; a true sequel to it was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007 , in the form of Phantom Hourglass . Miyamoto explained in interviews that the graphical style was chosen to satisfy demand , and that it better fit the theme of an older incarnation of Link . The game runs on a modified The Wind Waker engine . 
 Prior Zelda games have employed a theme of two separate , yet connected , worlds . In A Link to the Past , Link travels between a " Light World " and a " Dark World " ; in Ocarina of Time , as well as in Oracle of Ages , Link travels between two different time periods . The Zelda team sought to reuse this motif in the series ' latest installment . It was suggested that Link transform into a wolf , much like he metamorphoses into a rabbit in the Dark World of A Link to the Past . The story of the game was created by Aonuma , and later underwent several changes by scenario writers Mitsuhiro Takano and Aya <unk> . Takano created the script for the story scenes , while <unk> and Takayuki Ikkaku handled the actual in @-@ game script . Aonuma left his team working on the new idea while he directed The Minish Cap for the Game Boy Advance . When he returned , he found the Twilight Princess team struggling . Emphasis on the parallel worlds and the wolf transformation had made Link 's character unbelievable . Aonuma also felt the gameplay lacked the caliber of innovation found in Phantom Hourglass , which was being developed with touch controls for the Nintendo DS . At the same time , the Wii was under development with the code name " Revolution " . Miyamoto thought that the Revolution 's pointing device , the Wii Remote , was well suited for aiming arrows in Zelda , and suggested that Aonuma consider using it . 
 = = = Wii transition = = = 
 Aonuma had anticipated creating a Zelda game for what would later be called the Wii , but had assumed that he would need to complete Twilight Princess first . His team began work developing a pointing @-@ based interface for the bow and arrow , and Aonuma found that aiming directly at the screen gave the game a new feel , just like the DS control scheme for Phantom Hourglass . Aonuma felt confident this was the only way to proceed , but worried about consumers who had been anticipating a GameCube release . Developing two versions would mean delaying the previously announced 2005 release , still disappointing the consumer . Satoru Iwata felt that having both versions would satisfy users in the end , even though they would have to wait for the finished product . Aonuma then started working on both versions in parallel . 
 Transferring GameCube development to the Wii was relatively simple , since the Wii was being created to be compatible with the GameCube . At E3 2005 , Nintendo released a small number of Nintendo DS game cards containing a preview trailer for Twilight Princess . They also announced that Zelda would appear on the Wii ( then codenamed " Revolution " ) , but it was not clear to the media if this meant Twilight Princess or a different game . 
 The team worked on a Wii control scheme , adapting camera control and the fighting mechanics to the new interface . A prototype was created that used a swinging gesture to control the sword from a first @-@ person viewpoint , but was unable to show the variety of Link 's movements . When the third @-@ person view was restored , Aonuma thought it felt strange to swing the Wii Remote with the right hand to control the sword in Link 's left hand , so the entire Wii version map was mirrored . Details about Wii controls began to surface in December 2005 when British publication NGC Magazine claimed that when a GameCube copy of Twilight Princess was played on the Revolution , it would give the player the option of using the Revolution controller . Miyamoto confirmed the Revolution controller @-@ functionality in an interview with Nintendo of Europe and Time reported this soon after . However , support for the Wii controller did not make it into the GameCube release . At E3 2006 , Nintendo announced that both versions would be available at the Wii launch , and had a playable version of Twilight Princess for the Wii . Later , the GameCube release was pushed back to a month after the launch of the Wii . 
 Nintendo staff members reported that demo users complained about the difficulty of the control scheme . Aonuma realized that his team had implemented Wii controls under the mindset of " forcing " users to adapt , instead of making the system intuitive and easy to use . He began rethinking the controls with Miyamoto to focus on comfort and ease . The camera movement was reworked and item controls were changed to avoid accidental button presses . In addition , the new item system required use of the button that had previously been used for the sword . To solve this , sword controls were transferred back to gestures — something E3 attendees had commented they would like to see . This reintroduced the problem of using a right @-@ handed swing to control a left @-@ handed sword attack . The team did not have enough time before release to rework Link 's character model , so they instead flipped the entire game — everything was made a mirror image . Link was now right @-@ handed , and references to " east " and " west " were switched around . The GameCube version , however , was left with the original orientation . The Twilight Princess player 's guide focuses on the Wii version , but has a section in the back with mirror @-@ image maps for GameCube users . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The game 's score was composed by Toru Minegishi and Asuka Ohta , with series regular Koji Kondo serving as the sound supervisor . Minegishi took charge of composition and sound design in Twilight Princess , providing all field and dungeon music . For the trailers , three pieces were written by different composers , two of which were created by Mahito Yokota and Kondo . Michiru Ōshima created orchestral arrangements for the three compositions , later to be performed by an ensemble conducted by <unk> Takemoto . Kondo 's piece was later chosen as music for the E3 2005 trailer and for the demo movie after the game 's title screen . 
 Media requests at the trade show prompted Kondo to consider using orchestral music for the other tracks in the game as well , a notion reinforced by his preference for live instruments . He originally envisioned a full 50 @-@ person orchestra for action sequences and a string quartet for more " lyrical moments " , though the final product used sequenced music instead . Kondo later cited the lack of interactivity that comes with orchestral music as one of the main reasons for the decision . Both six- and seven @-@ track versions of the game 's soundtrack were released on November 19 , 2006 , as part of a Nintendo Power promotion and bundled with replicas of the Master Sword and the Hylian Shield .

 Following the discovery of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Wii version of Twilight Princess , an exploit known as the " Twilight Hack " was developed , allowing the execution of custom code from a Secure Digital ( SD ) card on the console . A specifically designed save file would cause the game to load unsigned code , which could include <unk> and <unk> Format ( ELF ) programs and homebrew Wii applications . Versions 3 @.@ 3 and 3 @.@ 4 of the Wii Menu prevented copying exploited save files onto the console until circumvention methods were discovered , and version 4 @.@ 0 of the Wii Menu patched the vulnerability .

 A high @-@ definition remaster of the game , The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess HD , was developed by Tantalus Media for the Wii U.

The game was released in North America and Europe on March 4 , 2016 ; in Australia on March 5 , 2016 ; and in Japan on March 10 , 2016 . 
 Certain bundles of the game contain a Wolf Link Amiibo figurine , which unlocks a Wii U @-@ exclusive dungeon called the " Cave of Shadows " and can carry data over to The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild . Other Zelda @-@ related Amiibo figurines have distinct functions : Link and Toon Link replenish arrows , Zelda and Sheik restore Link 's health , and Ganondorf causes Link to take twice as much damage . A CD containing 20 musical selections from the game was available as a GameStop preorder bonus in North America ; it is included with the limited @-@ edition bundle in other regions .

 Plumb began his international competitive three @-@ day event career at the 1959 Pan American Games in Chicago , Illinois . Throughout his career he competed for the United States in several other Pan @-@ American Games , and won three gold medals , including an individual gold in 1963 and team golds in 1963 and 1967 . Plumb also competed at several Eventing World Championships , accruing four medals . In 1974 he assisted the US team to a silver , while also taking silver in the individual competition , and helped the US team to bronze medals in both 1978 and 1982 . 
 As of 2008 , Plumb was the US Olympic athlete with the greatest number of appearances in any sport at the Games . He was named to the US team in every Olympic games between 1960 ( his first ) and 1984 , as well as appearing for the last time at the 1992 Summer Olympics , and competed at all of the Games except for 1980 , when the US did not compete . During his seven Olympic appearances , he gathered multiple medals . At the 1960 Summer Olympics , Plumb took an individual 15th , while the US team did not finish the competition . At the 1964 Games , he repeated his individual performance , while the US team improved to take the silver medal . At these Games , he became the first rider ever to win a medal on a horse that he had never previously ridden in competition . Plumb had planned to ride his main event horse , Markham , but on the flight to the Games in Tokyo , the horse panicked , possibly due to a bad experience previously suffered in a horse trailer . In order to keep him from destroying his stall and potentially the aircraft , the horse was euthanized . Plumb instead rode Bold Minstrel , a horse loaned to him by another top @-@ level eventer . 
 In 1968 , at Ciudad de Mexico , Plumb took an individual 14th , while the US team again finished with a silver . In 1970 , when Jack le Goff became coach of the United States eventing team , Plumb was one of only three active US riders with international experience in the sport . Between then and 1984 , when le Goff retired , the US eventing team , with Plumb as part , amassed three team and three individual medals , as well as additional triumphs at the World Equestrian Games and Pan @-@ American Games . At the 1972 Summer Olympics , the US team took the silver medal for the third Games in a row , while Plumb finished 20th individually . At the 1976 Games , Plumb achieved his only individual medal , taking silver , while the US team took gold . Despite the US boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics , Plumb competed at the alternate games in Fontainebleau , France .

The main biological functions of lipids include storing energy , signaling , and acting as structural components of cell membranes . Lipids have applications in the cosmetic and food industries as well as in nanotechnology . 
 Lipids may be broadly defined as hydrophobic or amphiphilic small molecules ; the amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles , multilamellar / <unk> liposomes , or membranes in an aqueous environment . Biological lipids originate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or " building @-@ blocks " : ketoacyl and isoprene groups . Using this approach , lipids may be divided into eight categories : fatty acids , glycerolipids , glycerophospholipids , sphingolipids , saccharolipids , and polyketides ( derived from condensation of ketoacyl subunits ) ; and sterol lipids and <unk> lipids ( derived from condensation of isoprene subunits ) . 
 Although the term lipid is sometimes used as a synonym for fats , fats are a subgroup of lipids called triglycerides . Lipids also encompass molecules such as fatty acids and their derivatives ( including tri- , di- , monoglycerides , and phospholipids ) , as well as other sterol @-@ containing metabolites such as cholesterol . Although humans and other mammals use various biosynthetic pathways both to break down and to synthesize lipids , some essential lipids cannot be made this way and must be obtained from the diet . 
 = = Categories of lipids = = 
 = = = Fatty acids = = = 
 Fatty acids , or fatty acid residues when they are part of a lipid , are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain @-@ elongation of an acetyl @-@ CoA primer with malonyl @-@ CoA or <unk> @-@ CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis . They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group ; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar , hydrophilic end , and a nonpolar , hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water . The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids , and is commonly used as a building @-@ block of more structurally complex lipids . The carbon chain , typically between four and 24 carbons long , may be saturated or unsaturated , and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen , halogens , nitrogen , and sulfur . If a fatty acid contains a double bond , there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism , which significantly affects the molecule 's configuration . Cis @-@ double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend , an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain . Three double bonds in 18 @-@ carbon linolenic acid , the most abundant fatty @-@ acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes , render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low @-@ temperatures , and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13 @-@ C NMR spectra of chloroplasts . This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes . Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration , although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils . 
 Examples of biologically important fatty acids include the eicosanoids , derived primarily from arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid , that include prostaglandins , leukotrienes , and thromboxanes . <unk> acid is also important in biological systems , particularly with respect to sight . Other major lipid classes in the fatty acid category are the fatty esters and fatty amides . Fatty esters include important biochemical intermediates such as wax esters , fatty acid thioester coenzyme A derivatives , fatty acid thioester ACP derivatives and fatty acid carnitines . The fatty amides include N @-@ acyl <unk> , such as the cannabinoid neurotransmitter <unk> . 
 = = = Glycerolipids = = = 
 Glycerolipids are composed of mono- , di- , and tri @-@ substituted <unk> , the best @-@ known being the fatty acid triesters of glycerol , called triglycerides . The word " <unk> " is sometimes used synonymously with " triglyceride " . In these compounds , the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol are each esterified , typically by different fatty acids . Because they function as an energy store , these lipids comprise the bulk of storage fat in animal tissues . The hydrolysis of the ester bonds of triglycerides and the release of glycerol and fatty acids from adipose tissue are the initial steps in metabolizing fat . 
 Additional subclasses of glycerolipids are represented by <unk> , which are characterized by the presence of one or more sugar residues attached to glycerol via a glycosidic linkage . Examples of structures in this category are the <unk> found in plant membranes and <unk> from mammalian sperm cells . 
 = = = Glycerophospholipids = = = 
 Glycerophospholipids , usually referred to as phospholipids , are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells , as well as being involved in metabolism and cell signaling . Neural tissue ( including the brain ) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids , and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders . Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes , based on the nature of the polar headgroup at the sn @-@ 3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and <unk> , or the sn @-@ 1 position in the case of archaebacteria . 
 Examples of glycerophospholipids found in biological membranes are phosphatidylcholine ( also known as PC , <unk> or <unk> ) , phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE or <unk> ) and phosphatidylserine ( PS or <unk> ) . In addition to serving as a primary component of cellular membranes and binding sites for intra- and intercellular proteins , some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells , such as <unk> and <unk> acids are either precursors of or , themselves , membrane @-@ derived second messengers . Typically , one or both of these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long @-@ chain fatty acids , but there are also alkyl @-@ linked and 1Z @-@ alkenyl @-@ linked ( <unk> ) glycerophospholipids , as well as <unk> variants in archaebacteria . 
 = = = Sphingolipids = = = 
 Sphingolipids are a complicated family of compounds that share a common structural feature , a sphingoid base backbone that is synthesized de novo from the amino acid serine and a long @-@ chain fatty acyl CoA , then converted into ceramides , phosphosphingolipids , glycosphingolipids and other compounds . The major sphingoid base of mammals is commonly referred to as sphingosine . <unk> ( N @-@ acyl @-@ sphingoid bases ) are a major subclass of sphingoid base derivatives with an amide @-@ linked fatty acid . The fatty acids are typically saturated or mono @-@ unsaturated with chain lengths from 16 to 26 carbon atoms . 
 The major phosphosphingolipids of mammals are sphingomyelins ( ceramide <unk> ) , whereas insects contain mainly ceramide <unk> and fungi have <unk> <unk> and mannose @-@ containing headgroups . The glycosphingolipids are a diverse family of molecules composed of one or more sugar residues linked via a glycosidic bond to the sphingoid base . Examples of these are the simple and complex glycosphingolipids such as <unk> and gangliosides . 
 = = = Sterol lipids = = = 
 Sterol lipids , such as cholesterol and its derivatives , are an important component of membrane lipids , along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins . The steroids , all derived from the same fused four @-@ ring core structure , have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules . The eighteen @-@ carbon ( C18 ) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and <unk> . The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids . The <unk> , comprising various forms of vitamin D , are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure . Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates , which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of cholesterol and are synthesized in the liver . The plant equivalents are the <unk> , such as β @-@ sitosterol , stigmasterol , and <unk> ; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth . The predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes is ergosterol . 
 = = = Prenol lipids = = = 
 Prenol lipids are synthesized from the five @-@ carbon @-@ unit precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate that are produced mainly via the mevalonic acid ( MVA ) pathway . The simple isoprenoids ( linear alcohols , diphosphates , etc . ) are formed by the successive addition of C5 units , and are classified according to number of these terpene units . Structures containing greater than 40 carbons are known as <unk> . Carotenoids are important simple isoprenoids that function as antioxidants and as precursors of vitamin A. Another biologically important class of molecules is exemplified by the quinones and hydroquinones , which contain an isoprenoid tail attached to a <unk> core of non @-@ isoprenoid origin . Vitamin E and vitamin K , as well as the <unk> , are examples of this class . Prokaryotes synthesize polyprenols ( called <unk> ) in which the terminal isoprenoid unit attached to oxygen remains unsaturated , whereas in animal polyprenols ( <unk> ) the terminal isoprenoid is reduced . 
 = = = Saccharolipids = = = 
 Saccharolipids describe compounds in which fatty acids are linked directly to a sugar backbone , forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers . In the saccharolipids , a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids . The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the Lipid A component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram @-@ negative bacteria . Typical lipid A molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine , which are <unk> with as many as seven fatty @-@ acyl chains . The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in E. coli is <unk> @-@ Lipid A , a hexa @-@ acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3 @-@ deoxy @-@ D @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> acid ( <unk> ) residues . 
 = = = Polyketides = = = 
 Polyketides are synthesized by polymerization of acetyl and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes as well as iterative and multimodular enzymes that share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases . They comprise a large number of secondary metabolites and natural products from animal , plant , bacterial , fungal and marine sources , and have great structural diversity . Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified by glycosylation , methylation , hydroxylation , oxidation , and / or other processes . Many commonly used anti @-@ microbial , anti @-@ parasitic , and anti @-@ cancer agents are polyketides or polyketide derivatives , such as <unk> , tetracyclines , <unk> , and antitumor epothilones . 
 = = Biological functions = = 
 = = = Membranes = = = 
 Eukaryotic cells feature compartmentalized membrane @-@ bound organelles that carry out different biological functions . The glycerophospholipids are the main structural component of biological membranes , such as the cellular plasma membrane and the intracellular membranes of organelles ; in animal cells the plasma membrane physically separates the intracellular components from the extracellular environment . The glycerophospholipids are amphipathic molecules ( containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions ) that contain a glycerol core linked to two fatty acid @-@ derived " tails " by ester linkages and to one " head " group by a phosphate ester linkage . While glycerophospholipids are the major component of biological membranes , other non @-@ <unk> lipid components such as sphingomyelin and sterols ( mainly cholesterol in animal cell membranes ) are also found in biological membranes . In plants and algae , the <unk> , and <unk> , which lack a phosphate group , are important components of membranes of chloroplasts and related organelles and are the most abundant lipids in photosynthetic tissues , including those of higher plants , algae and certain bacteria . 
 Plant thylakoid membranes have the largest lipid component of a non @-@ bilayer forming <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , and little phospholipids ; despite this unique lipid composition , chloroplast thylakoid membranes have been shown to contain a dynamic lipid @-@ bilayer matrix as revealed by magnetic resonance and electron microscope studies . 
 A biological membrane is a form of lamellar phase lipid bilayer . The formation of lipid bilayers is an energetically preferred process when the glycerophospholipids described above are in an aqueous environment . This is known as the hydrophobic effect . In an aqueous system , the polar heads of lipids align towards the polar , aqueous environment , while the hydrophobic tails minimize their contact with water and tend to cluster together , forming a vesicle ; depending on the concentration of the lipid , this biophysical interaction may result in the formation of micelles , liposomes , or lipid bilayers . Other aggregations are also observed and form part of the polymorphism of amphiphile ( lipid ) behavior . Phase behavior is an area of study within biophysics and is the subject of current academic research . <unk> and bilayers form in the polar medium by a process known as the hydrophobic effect . When dissolving a lipophilic or amphiphilic substance in a polar environment , the polar molecules ( i.e. , water in an aqueous solution ) become more ordered around the dissolved lipophilic substance , since the polar molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds to the lipophilic areas of the amphiphile . So in an aqueous environment , the water molecules form an ordered " clathrate " cage around the dissolved lipophilic molecule . 
 The formation of lipids into <unk> membranes represents a key step in models of abiogenesis , the origin of life . 
 = = = Energy storage = = = 
 <unk> , stored in adipose tissue , are a major form of energy storage both in animals and plants . The <unk> , or fat cell , is designed for continuous synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides in animals , with breakdown controlled mainly by the activation of hormone @-@ sensitive enzyme lipase . The complete oxidation of fatty acids provides high caloric content , about 9 kcal / g , compared with 4 kcal / g for the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins . Migratory birds that must fly long distances without eating use stored energy of triglycerides to fuel their flights . 
 = = = Signaling = = = 
 In recent years , evidence has emerged showing that lipid signaling is a vital part of the cell signaling . Lipid signaling may occur via activation of G protein @-@ coupled or nuclear receptors , and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as signaling molecules and cellular messengers . These include sphingosine @-@ 1 @-@ phosphate , a sphingolipid derived from ceramide that is a potent messenger molecule involved in regulating calcium mobilization , cell growth , and apoptosis ; diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates ( <unk> ) , involved in calcium @-@ mediated activation of protein kinase C ; the prostaglandins , which are one type of fatty @-@ acid derived eicosanoid involved in inflammation and immunity ; the steroid hormones such as estrogen , testosterone and cortisol , which modulate a host of functions such as reproduction , metabolism and blood pressure ; and the <unk> such as 25 @-@ hydroxy @-@ cholesterol that are liver X receptor agonists . Phosphatidylserine lipids are known to be involved in signaling for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and / or pieces of cells . They accomplish this by being exposed to the extracellular face of the cell membrane after the inactivation of flippases which place them exclusively on the cytosolic side and the activation of scramblases , which scramble the orientation of the phospholipids . After this occurs , other cells recognize the <unk> and <unk> the cells or cell fragments exposing them . 
 = = = Other functions = = = 
 The " fat @-@ soluble " vitamins ( A , D , E and K ) – which are isoprene @-@ based lipids – are essential nutrients stored in the liver and fatty tissues , with a diverse range of functions . Acyl @-@ carnitines are involved in the transport and metabolism of fatty acids in and out of mitochondria , where they undergo beta oxidation . <unk> and their phosphorylated derivatives also play important transport roles , in this case the transport of oligosaccharides across membranes . <unk> phosphate sugars and polyprenol diphosphate sugars function in extra @-@ cytoplasmic glycosylation reactions , in extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis ( for instance , peptidoglycan polymerization in bacteria ) , and in eukaryotic protein N @-@ glycosylation . <unk> are a subclass of glycerophospholipids containing four acyl chains and three glycerol groups that are particularly abundant in the inner mitochondrial membrane . They are believed to activate enzymes involved with oxidative phosphorylation . Lipids also form the basis of steroid hormones . 
 = = Metabolism = = 
 The major dietary lipids for humans and other animals are animal and plant triglycerides , sterols , and membrane phospholipids . The process of lipid metabolism synthesizes and degrades the lipid stores and produces the structural and functional lipids characteristic of individual tissues . 
 = = = Biosynthesis = = = 
 In animals , when there is an oversupply of dietary carbohydrate , the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides . This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl @-@ CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides , a process called <unk> . Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl @-@ CoA units . The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group , reduce it to an alcohol , dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group . The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups , in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein , while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway . The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver . 
 The synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction , whereby a double bond is introduced into the fatty acyl chain . For example , in humans , the desaturation of stearic acid by <unk> @-@ CoA <unk> @-@ 1 produces oleic acid . The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid as well as the <unk> unsaturated α @-@ linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues , and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet . 
 <unk> synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum by metabolic pathways in which acyl groups in fatty acyl @-@ <unk> are transferred to the hydroxyl groups of glycerol @-@ 3 @-@ phosphate and diacylglycerol . 
 Terpenes and isoprenoids , including the carotenoids , are made by the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate . These precursors can be made in different ways . In animals and archaea , the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl @-@ CoA , while in plants and bacteria the non @-@ mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3 @-@ phosphate as substrates . One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis . Here , the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol . Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol . 
 = = = Degradation = = = 
 Beta oxidation is the metabolic process by which fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria and / or in peroxisomes to generate acetyl @-@ CoA . For the most part , fatty acids are oxidized by a mechanism that is similar to , but not identical with , a reversal of the process of fatty acid synthesis . That is , two @-@ carbon fragments are removed sequentially from the carboxyl end of the acid after steps of dehydrogenation , hydration , and oxidation to form a beta @-@ keto acid , which is split by <unk> . The acetyl @-@ CoA is then ultimately converted into ATP , CO2 , and H2O using the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain . Hence the citric acid cycle can start at acetyl @-@ CoA when fat is being broken down for energy if there is little or no glucose available . The energy yield of the complete oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate is 106 ATP . <unk> and odd @-@ chain fatty acids require additional enzymatic steps for degradation . 
 = = Nutrition and health = = 
 Most of the fat found in food is in the form of triglycerides , cholesterol , and phospholipids . Some dietary fat is necessary to facilitate absorption of fat @-@ soluble vitamins ( A , D , E , and K ) and carotenoids . Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids , such as linoleic acid ( an omega @-@ 6 fatty acid ) and alpha @-@ linolenic acid ( an omega @-@ 3 fatty acid ) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet . Both of these fatty acids are 18 @-@ carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds . Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid ( safflower , sunflower , and corn oils ) . Alpha @-@ linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants , and in selected seeds , nuts , and legumes ( in particular flax , rapeseed , walnut , and soy ) . Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer @-@ chain omega @-@ 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) . A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega @-@ 3 fatty acids on infant development , cancer , cardiovascular diseases , and various mental illnesses , such as depression , attention @-@ deficit hyperactivity disorder , and dementia . In contrast , it is now well @-@ established that consumption of trans fats , such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils , are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease . 
 A few studies have suggested that total dietary fat intake is linked to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes . However , a number of very large studies , including the Women 's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial , an eight @-@ year study of 49 @,@ 000 women , the Nurses ' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow @-@ up Study , revealed no such links . None of these studies suggested any connection between percentage of calories from fat and risk of cancer , heart disease , or weight gain . The Nutrition Source , a website maintained by the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health , summarizes the current evidence on the impact of dietary fat : " Detailed research — much of it done at Harvard — shows that the total amount of fat in the diet isn 't really linked with weight or disease . " 
 = Chelsea Manning = 
 Chelsea Elizabeth Manning ( born Bradley Edward Manning , December 17 , 1987 ) is a United States Army soldier who was convicted by court @-@ martial in July 2013 of violations of the Espionage Act and other offenses , after disclosing to WikiLeaks nearly three @-@ quarters of a million classified or unclassified but sensitive military and diplomatic documents . Manning was sentenced in August 2013 to 35 years imprisonment , with the possibility of parole in the eighth year , and to be dishonorably discharged from the Army . Manning is a trans woman who , in a statement the day after sentencing , said she had felt female since childhood , wanted to be known as Chelsea , and desired to begin hormone replacement therapy . From early life and through much of her Army life , Manning was known as Bradley ; she was diagnosed with gender identity disorder while in the Army . 
 Assigned in 2009 to an Army unit in Iraq as an intelligence analyst , Manning had access to classified databases . In early 2010 , she leaked classified information to WikiLeaks and confided this to Adrian Lamo , an online acquaintance . Lamo informed Army Counterintelligence , and Manning was arrested in May that same year . The material included videos of the July 12 , 2007 Baghdad airstrike , and the 2009 Granai airstrike in Afghanistan ; 251 @,@ 287 U.S. diplomatic cables ; and 482 @,@ 832 Army reports that came to be known as the Iraq War Logs and Afghan War Diary . Much of the material was published by WikiLeaks or its media partners between April and November 2010 . 
 Manning was ultimately charged with 22 offenses , including aiding the enemy , which was the most serious charge and could have resulted in a death sentence . She was held at the Marine Corps Brig , Quantico in Virginia , from July 2010 to April 2011 under Prevention of Injury status — which entailed de facto solitary confinement and other restrictions that caused domestic and international concern — before being transferred to Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , where she could interact with other detainees . She pleaded guilty in February 2013 to 10 of the charges . The trial on the remaining charges began on June 3 , 2013 , and on July 30 she was convicted of 17 of the original charges and amended versions of four others , but was acquitted of aiding the enemy . She is serving a 35 @-@ year sentence at the maximum @-@ security U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth . 
 Reaction to Manning 's disclosures , arrest , and sentence was mixed . Denver Nicks , one of her biographers , writes that the leaked material , particularly the diplomatic cables , was widely seen as a catalyst for the Arab Spring that began in December 2010 , and that Manning was viewed as both a 21st @-@ century Tiananmen Square Tank Man and an embittered traitor . Reporters Without Borders condemned the length of the sentence , saying that it demonstrated how vulnerable whistleblowers are . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Born Bradley Edward Manning in 1987 in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , she was the second child of Susan Fox , originally from Wales , and Brian Manning , an American . Brian had joined the United States Navy in 1974 at the age of 19 , and served for five years as an intelligence analyst . Brian met Susan in a local Woolworths while stationed in Wales at Cawdor Barracks . Manning 's older sister was born in 1976 . The couple returned to the United States in 1979 , settling first in California . After their move near Crescent , Oklahoma they bought a two @-@ story house with an above @-@ ground swimming pool and 5 acres ( 2 hectares ) of land , where they kept pigs and chickens . 
 Manning 's sister Casey , 11 years her senior , told the court @-@ martial that both their parents were alcoholics , and that their mother had drunk continually while pregnant with Chelsea . Captain David Moulton , a Navy psychiatrist , told the court that Manning 's facial features showed signs of fetal alcohol syndrome . Casey became Manning 's principal caregiver , waking at night to make a bottle for the baby . The court heard that Manning was fed only milk and baby food until the age of two . As an adult she reached 5 ft 2 in ( 1 @.@ 57 m ) and weighed around 105 pounds ( 48 kg ) . 
 Manning 's father took a job as an information technology ( IT ) manager for a rental car agency , which required travel . The family lived several miles out of town and Manning 's mother was unable to drive . She spent her days drinking , while Manning was left largely to fend for herself , playing with Legos or on the computer . Brian would stock up on food before his trips , and leave pre @-@ signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills . A neighbor said that whenever Manning 's elementary school went on field trips , she would give her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat . Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family . 
 = = = Parents ' divorce , move to Wales = = = 
 Those who knew Manning said that even as a child , she always had a mind of her own . She was an atheist who was openly opposed to religion , for example , remaining silent during the part of the Pledge of Allegiance that refers to God . In a 2011 interview Manning 's father said , " People need to understand that he 's a young man that had a happy life growing up . " He also said that Manning excelled at the saxophone , science , and computers , creating her first website at the age of ten . Manning taught herself how to use PowerPoint , won the grand prize three years in a row at the local science fair , and in sixth grade , took top prize at a statewide quiz bowl . 
 A childhood friend of Manning 's , speaking about a conversation they had when Manning was 13 , said " he told me he was gay . " The friend also said that Manning 's home life was not good and that her father was very controlling . Around this time , Manning 's parents divorced . She and her mother Susan moved out of the house to a rented apartment in Crescent , Oklahoma . Susan 's instability continued and in 1998 she attempted suicide ; Manning 's sister drove their mother to the hospital , with the 11 @-@ year @-@ old Manning sitting in the back of the car trying to make sure their mother was still breathing . 
 Manning 's father remarried in 2000 , the same year as his divorce . His new wife was also named Susan and had a son from a previous relationship . Manning apparently reacted badly when the son changed his surname to Manning too ; she started taking running jumps at the walls , telling her mother : " I 'm nobody now . " 
 In November 2001 , Manning and her mother left the United States and moved to Haverfordwest , Wales , where her mother had family . Manning attended the town 's Tasker Milward secondary school . A schoolfriend there told Ed Caesar for The Sunday Times that Manning 's personality was " unique , extremely unique . Very quirky , very opinionated , very political , very clever , very articulate . " Manning 's interest in computers continued , and in 2003 , she and a friend set up a website , <unk> , a message board that offered games and music downloads . 
 Manning became the target of bullying at the school because she was the only American and was viewed as effeminate . Manning had identified to two friends in Oklahoma as gay , but was not open about it at school in Wales . The students would imitate her accent , and apparently abandoned her once during a camping trip ; her aunt told The Washington Post that Manning awoke to an empty camp site one morning , after everyone else had packed up their tents and left without her . 
 = = = Return to the United States = = = 
 Fearing that her mother was becoming too ill to cope , in 2005 ( at the age of 17 ) Manning returned to the United States . She moved in with her father in Oklahoma City , where he was living with his second wife and her child . Manning got a job as a developer with a software company , <unk> , and was apparently happy for a time , but was let go after four months . Her boss told The Washington Post that on a few occasions , Manning had " just locked up , " and would simply sit and stare , and in the end communication became too difficult . The boss told the newspaper that " nobody 's been taking care of this kid for a really long time . " 
 By then , Manning was living as an openly gay man . Her relationship with her father was apparently good , but there were problems between Manning and her stepmother . In March 2006 , Manning reportedly threatened her stepmother with a knife during an argument about Manning 's failure to get another job ; the stepmother called the police and Manning was asked to leave the house . Manning drove to Tulsa in a pickup truck her father had given her , at first sleeping in it , then moving in with a friend from school . The two got jobs at Incredible Pizza in April . Manning moved on to Chicago before running out of money and again having nowhere to stay . Her mother arranged for Brian 's sister , Debra , a lawyer in Potomac , Maryland , to take Manning in . Nicks writes that the 15 months Manning spent with her aunt were among the most stable of her life . Manning had a boyfriend , took several low @-@ paid jobs , and spent a semester studying history and English at Montgomery College , but left after failing an exam . 
 = = Military service = = 
 = = = Enlistment in the Army = = = 
 Manning 's father spent weeks in the fall of 2007 asking her to consider joining the Army . Hoping to gain a college education through the G.I. Bill , and perhaps to study for a PhD in physics , she enlisted in September that year . She told her Army supervisor later that she had also hoped joining such a masculine environment would resolve her gender identity disorder . 
 Manning began basic training at Fort Leonard Wood , Missouri , on October 2 , 2007 . She wrote that she soon realized she was neither physically nor mentally prepared for it . Six weeks after enlisting , she was sent to the discharge unit . She was allegedly being bullied , and in the opinion of another soldier , was having a breakdown . The soldier told The Guardian : " The kid was barely five foot ... He was a runt , so pick on him . He 's crazy , pick on him . He 's a faggot , pick on him . The guy took it from every side . He couldn 't please anyone . " Denver Nicks writes that Manning , who was used to being bullied , fought back — if the drill sergeants screamed at her , she would scream at them — to the point where they started calling her " General Manning . " 
 The decision to discharge her was revoked , and she started basic training again in January 2008 . After graduating in April , she moved to Fort Huachuca , Arizona , in order to attend Advanced Individual Training ( AIT ) for Military Occupational Specialty ( MOS ) <unk> , intelligence analyst , receiving a TS / SCI security clearance ( Top Secret / Sensitive <unk> Information ) . According to Nicks , this security clearance , combined with the digitization of classified information and the government 's policy of sharing it widely , gave Manning access to an unprecedented amount of material . Nicks writes that Manning was reprimanded while at Fort Huachuca for posting three video messages to friends on YouTube , in which she described the inside of the " Sensitive <unk> Information Facility " ( <unk> ) where she worked . Upon completion of her initial MOS course , Manning received the Army Service Ribbon and the National Defense Service Medal . 
 = = = Move to Fort Drum , deployment to Iraq = = = 
 In August 2008 , Manning was sent to Fort Drum in Jefferson County , New York , where she joined the 2nd Brigade Combat Team , 10th Mountain Division , and trained for deployment to Iraq . In the fall of 2008 while stationed there , she met Tyler Watkins , who was studying neuroscience and psychology at Brandeis University , near Boston . Watkins was her first serious relationship , and she posted happily on Facebook about it , regularly traveling 300 miles ( 480 km ) to Boston on visits . 
 Watkins introduced her to a network of friends and the university 's hacker community . She also visited Boston University 's " <unk> " workshop , known as " Builds " , and met its founder , David House , the MIT researcher who was later allowed to visit her in jail . In November 2008 , she gave an anonymous interview to a high @-@ school reporter during a rally in Syracuse in support of gay marriage :

 Nicks writes that Manning would travel back to Washington , D.C. , for visits . An ex @-@ boyfriend helped her find her way around the city 's gay community , introducing her to lobbyists , activists , and White House aides . Back at Fort Drum , she continued to display emotional problems and , by August 2009 , had been referred to an Army mental @-@ health counselor . A friend told Nicks that Manning could be emotionally fraught , describing an evening they had watched two movies together — The Last King of Scotland and Dancer in the Dark — after which Manning cried for hours . By September 2009 her relationship with Watkins was in trouble ; they reconciled for a short time , but it was effectively over . 
 After four weeks at the Joint Readiness Training Center ( <unk> ) in Fort Polk , Louisiana , Manning was deployed to Forward Operating Base Hammer , near Baghdad , arriving in October 2009 . From her workstation there , she had access to <unk> ( the Secret Internet Protocol <unk> Network ) and <unk> ( the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System ) . Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq ; it was felt she was a risk to herself and possibly others , according to a statement later issued by the Army — but the shortage of intelligence analysts held sway . In November 2009 , she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist . 
 = = = Contact with gender counselor = = = 
 In November 2009 Manning wrote to a gender counselor in the United States , said she felt female , and discussed having surgery . The counselor told Steve Fishman of New York Magazine in 2011 that it was clear Manning was in crisis , partly because of her gender concerns , but also because she was opposed to the kind of war in which she found herself involved . 
 She was by all accounts unhappy and isolated . Because of the military 's " Don 't ask , don 't tell " policy ( known as DADT and in effect until September 20 , 2011 ) , Manning was unable to live as an openly gay man without risk of being discharged . But she apparently made no secret of her orientation : her friends said she kept a fairy wand on her desk . When she told her roommate she was attracted to men , he responded by suggesting they not speak to each other . Manning 's working conditions included 14- to 15 @-@ hour night shifts in a tightly packed , dimly lit room . 
 On December 20 , 2009 , during a counseling session with two colleagues to discuss her poor time @-@ keeping , Manning was told she would lose her one day off a week for persistent lateness . She responded by overturning a table , damaging a computer that was sitting on it . A sergeant moved Manning away from the weapons rack , and other soldiers pinned her arms behind her back and dragged her out of the room . Several witnesses to the incident believed her access to sensitive material ought to have been withdrawn at that point . The following month , January 2010 , she began posting on Facebook that she felt hopeless and alone .

 Manning told Amnesty International 
 These documents were important because they relate to two connected counter @-@ insurgency conflicts in real @-@ time from the ground . Humanity has never had this complete and detailed a record of what modern warfare actually looks like . Once you realize that the co @-@ ordinates represent a real place where people live that the dates happened in our recent history ; that the numbers are actually human lives – with all the love , hope , dreams , hatred , fear , and nightmares that come with them – then it 's difficult to ever forget how important these documents are . 
 = = = Release of material to WikiLeaks = = = 
 Manning said her first contact with WikiLeaks took place in January 2010 , when she began to interact with them on IRC and Jabber . She had first noticed them toward the end of November 2009 , when they posted 570 @,@ 000 pager messages from the September 11 attacks . 
 On January 5 , 2010 , Manning downloaded the 400 @,@ 000 documents that became known as the Iraq War logs . On January 8 she downloaded 91 @,@ 000 documents from the Afghanistan database , the Afghan War logs . She saved the material on CD @-@ RW , and smuggled it through security by labeling the CD @-@ RW media " Lady Gaga " . She then copied it onto her personal computer . The next day she wrote a message in a <unk> file ( see right ) , which she told the court was initially intended for The Washington Post . 
 Manning copied the files from her laptop to an SD card for her camera so that she could take it with her to the United States while on R & R leave . Army investigators later found the SD card in Manning 's basement room in her aunt 's home in Potomac , Maryland . On January 23 Manning flew to the United States via Germany for two weeks of leave . It was during this visit that she first went out dressed as a woman , wearing a wig and makeup . After her arrest , her former partner , Tyler Watkins , told Wired that Manning had said during the visit that she had found some sensitive information and was considering leaking it . 
 Manning contacted The Washington Post and The New York Times to ask if they were interested in the material ; the Post reporter did not sound interested and the Times did not return the call . Manning decided instead to pass it to WikiLeaks , and on February 3 sent them the Iraq and Afghan War logs via Tor . She returned to Iraq on February 11 , with no acknowledgement from WikiLeaks that they had received the files . 
 On or around February 18 she passed WikiLeaks a diplomatic cable , dated January 13 , 2010 , from the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavík , Iceland . They published it within hours , which suggested to Manning that they had received the other material too . She found the Baghdad helicopter attack ( " Collateral murder " ) video in a Judge Advocate 's directory , and passed it to WikiLeaks on or around February 21 . In late March she sent them a video of the May 2009 Granai airstrike in Afghanistan ; this was the video later removed and apparently destroyed by Daniel Domscheit @-@ Berg when he left the organization . Between March 28 and April 9 she downloaded the 250 @,@ 000 diplomatic cables , and uploaded them to a WikiLeaks <unk> on April 10 . 
 Manning told the court that , during her interaction with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber , she developed a friendship with someone there , believed to be Julian Assange ( although neither knew the other 's name ) , which she said made her feel she could be herself . Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats , in unallocated space on her MacBook 's hard drive , between Manning and someone believed to be Assange . She wrote in a statement that the more she had tried to fit in at work , the more alienated she became from everyone around her . The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety . 
 = = = Email to supervisor , recommended discharge = = = 
 On April 24 , 2010 , Manning sent an email to her supervisor , Master Sergeant Paul Adkins — with the subject line " My Problem " — saying she was suffering from gender identity disorder . She attached a photograph of herself dressed as a woman and with the filename <unk> She wrote : 
 This is my problem . I 've had signs of it for a very long time . It 's caused problems within my family . I thought a career in the military would get rid of it . It 's not something I seek out for attention , and I 've been trying very , very hard to get rid of it by placing myself in situations where it would be impossible . But , it 's not going away ; it 's haunting me more and more as I get older . Now , the consequences of it are dire , at a time when it 's causing me great pain in itself ... 
 Adkins discussed the situation with Manning 's therapists , but did not pass the email to anybody above him in his chain of command ; he told Manning 's court @-@ martial that he was concerned the photograph would be disseminated among other staff . Captain Steven Lim , Manning 's company commander , said he first saw the email after Manning 's arrest , when information about hormone replacement therapy was found in Manning 's room on base ; at that point Lim learned that Manning had been calling herself Breanna . 
 Manning told former " grey hat " hacker Adrian Lamo that she had set up Twitter and YouTube accounts as Breanna to give her female identity a digital presence , writing to Lamo : " I wouldn 't mind going to prison for the rest of my life [ for leaking information ] , or being executed so much , if it wasn 't for the possibility of having pictures of me ... plastered all over the world press ... as [ a ] boy ... [ ... ] the CPU is not made for this motherboard ... " On April 30 she posted on Facebook that she was utterly lost , and over the next few days wrote that she was " not a piece of equipment , " and was " beyond frustrated " and " livid " after being " lectured by ex @-@ boyfriend despite months of relationship ambiguity ... " 
 On May 7 , according to Army witnesses , Manning was found curled in a fetal position in a storage cupboard ; she had a knife at her feet and had cut the words " I want " into a vinyl chair . A few hours later she had an altercation with a female intelligence analyst , Specialist <unk> Showman , during which she punched Showman in the face . The brigade psychiatrist recommended a discharge , referring to an " occupational problem and adjustment disorder . " Manning 's supervisor removed the bolt from her weapon , making it unable to fire , and she was sent to work in the supply office , although at this point her security clearance remained in place . As punishment for the altercation with Showman , she was demoted from Specialist ( E @-@ 4 ) to Private First Class ( E @-@ 3 ) three days before her arrest on May 27 . 
 Ellen Nakashima writes that , on May 9 , Manning contacted Jonathan Odell , a gay American novelist in Minneapolis , via Facebook , leaving a message that she wanted to speak to him in confidence ; she said she had been involved in some " very high @-@ profile events , albeit as a nameless individual thus far . " On May 19 , according to Army investigators , she emailed Eric <unk> , a mathematician she had met in Boston , and told him she had been the source of the Baghdad airstrike video . Two days later , she began the series of chats with Adrian Lamo that led to her arrest . 
 = = Publication of leaked material = = 
 = = = WikiLeaks = = = 
 WikiLeaks was set up in late 2006 as a disclosure portal , initially using the Wikipedia model , where volunteers would write up restricted or legally threatened material submitted by whistleblowers . It was Julian Assange — an Australian Internet activist and journalist , and the de facto editor @-@ in @-@ chief of WikiLeaks — who had the idea of creating what Ben Laurie called an " open @-@ source , democratic intelligence agency . " The open @-@ editing aspect was soon abandoned , but the site remained open for anonymous submissions . 
 According to Daniel Domscheit @-@ Berg , a former WikiLeaks spokesperson , part of the WikiLeaks security concept was that they did not know who their sources were . The New York Times wrote in December 2010 that the U.S. government was trying to discover whether Assange had been a passive recipient of material from Manning , or had encouraged or helped her to extract the files ; if the latter , Assange could be charged with conspiracy . Manning told Lamo in May 2010 that she had developed a working relationship with Assange , communicating directly with him using an encrypted Internet conferencing service , but knew little about him . WikiLeaks did not identify Manning as their source . Army investigators found pages of chats on Manning 's computer between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange . Nicks writes that , despite this , no decisive evidence was found of Assange offering Manning any direction . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 On February 18 , 2010 , WikiLeaks posted the first of the material from Manning , the diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavík , a document now known as <unk> . On March 15 WikiLeaks posted a 32 @-@ page report written in 2008 by the U.S. Department of Defense about WikiLeaks itself , and on March 29 it posted U.S. State Department profiles of politicians in Iceland . 
 = = = Baghdad airstrike = = = 
 WikiLeaks named the Baghdad airstrike video " Collateral Murder , " and Assange released it on April 5 , 2010 , during a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington , D.C. The video showed two American helicopters firing on a group of ten men in the Amin District of Baghdad . Two were Reuters employees there to photograph an American Humvee under attack by the Mahdi Army . Pilots mistook their cameras for weapons . The helicopters also fired on a van , targeted earlier by one helicopter , that had stopped to help wounded members of the first group . Two children in the van were wounded and their father was killed . Pilots also engaged a building where retreating insurgents were holed up . The Washington Post wrote that it was this video , viewed by millions , that put WikiLeaks on the map . According to Nicks , Manning emailed a superior officer after the video aired and tried to persuade her that it was the same version as the one stored on <unk> . Nicks writes that it seemed as though Manning wanted to be caught .

 WikiLeaks and three media partners — The New York Times , The Guardian , and Der Spiegel — began publishing the 91 @,@ 731 documents that became known as the Afghan War logs on July 25 , 2010 . This was followed on October 22 , 2010 , by 391 @,@ 832 classified military reports covering the period January 2004 to December 2009 ; these became known as the Iraq War logs . Nicks writes that the publication of the former was a watershed moment , the " beginning of the information age exploding upon itself . "

 Manning was also responsible for the " <unk> " leak of 251 @,@ 287 State Department cables , written by 271 American embassies and consulates in 180 countries , dated December 1966 to February 2010 . The cables were passed by Assange to his three media partners , plus El País and others , and published in stages from November 28 , 2010 , with the names of sources removed . WikiLeaks said it was the largest set of confidential documents ever to be released into the public domain . The rest of the cables were published unredacted by WikiLeaks on September 1 , 2011 , after David Leigh and Luke Harding of The Guardian published the <unk> for a file that was still online ; Nicks writes that one Ethiopian journalist had to leave his country and the U.S. government said it had to relocate several sources . Manning was also the source of the Guantanamo Bay files leak , obtained by WikiLeaks in 2010 and published by The New York Times on April 24 , 2011 .

 Manning said she gave WikiLeaks a video , in late March 2010 , of the Granai airstrike in Afghanistan . The airstrike occurred on May 4 , 2009 , in the village of Granai , Afghanistan , killing 86 to 147 Afghan civilians . The video was never published ; Julian Assange said in March 2013 that Daniel Domscheit @-@ Berg had taken it with him when he left WikiLeaks , and had apparently destroyed it .

 = = = First contact = = = 
 On May 20 , 2010 , Manning contacted Adrian Lamo , a former " grey hat " hacker convicted in 2004 of having accessed The New York Times computer network two years earlier without permission . Lamo had been profiled that day by Kevin Poulsen in Wired magazine ; the story said Lamo had been involuntarily hospitalized and diagnosed with Asperger syndrome . Poulsen , by then a reporter , was himself a former hacker who had used Lamo as a source several times since 2000 . Indeed it was Poulsen who , in 2002 , had told The New York Times that Lamo had gained unauthorized access to its network ; Poulsen then wrote the story up for <unk> . Lamo would hack into a system , tell the organization , then offer to fix their security , often using Poulsen as a go @-@ between . 
 Lamo said Manning sent him several encrypted emails on May 20 . He said he was unable to decrypt them but replied anyway and invited the <unk> to chat on AOL IM . Lamo said he later turned the emails over to the FBI without having read them . 
 = = = Chats = = = 
 In a series of chats between May 21 and 25 , Manning — using the handle " <unk> " — told Lamo that she had leaked classified material . She introduced herself as an Army intelligence analyst , and within 17 minutes , without waiting for a reply , alluded to the leaks . 
 Lamo replied several hours later . He said : " I 'm a journalist and a minister . You can pick either , and treat this as a confession or an interview ( never to be published ) & enjoy a modicum of legal protection . " They talked about restricted material in general , then Manning made her first explicit reference to the leaks : " This is what I do for friends . " She linked to a section of the May 21 , 2010 , version of Wikipedia 's article on WikiLeaks , which described the WikiLeaks release in March that year of a Department of Defense report on WikiLeaks itself . She added " the one below that is mine too " ; the section below in the same article referred to the leak of the Baghdad airstrike ( " Collateral Murder " ) video . Manning said she felt isolated and fragile , and was reaching out to someone she hoped might understand . 
 Manning said she had started to help WikiLeaks around Thanksgiving in November 2009 — which fell on November 26 that year — after WikiLeaks had released the 9 / 11 pager messages ; the messages were released on November 25 . She told Lamo she had recognized that the messages came from an NSA database , and that seeing them had made her feel comfortable about stepping forward . Lamo asked what kind of material Manning was dealing with ; Manning replied : " <unk> ... crazy , almost criminal political <unk> ... the non @-@ PR @-@ versions of world events and crises ... " Although she said she dealt with Assange directly , Manning also said Assange had adopted a deliberate policy of knowing very little about her , telling Manning : " lie to me . " 
 Lamo again assured her that she was speaking in confidence . Manning wrote : " but im not a source for you ... im talking to you as someone who needs moral and emotional fucking support , " and Lamo replied : " i told you , none of this is for print . " 
 Manning said the incident that had affected her the most was when 15 detainees had been arrested by the Iraqi Federal Police for printing anti @-@ Iraqi literature . She was asked by the Army to find out who the " bad guys " were , and discovered that the detainees had followed what Manning said was a corruption trail within the Iraqi cabinet . She reported this to her commanding officer , but said " he didn 't want to hear any of it " ; she said the officer told her to help the Iraqi police find more detainees . Manning said it made her realize , " i was actively involved in something that i was completely against ... " 
 She explained that " i cant separate myself from others ... i feel connected to everybody ... like they were distant family , " and cited Carl Sagan , Richard Feynman and Elie Wiesel . She said she hoped the material would lead to " hopefully worldwide discussion , debates , and <unk> if not ... than [ sic ] we 're doomed as a species . " She said she had downloaded the material onto music CD @-@ <unk> , erased the music and replaced it with a compressed split file . Part of the reason no one noticed , she said , was that staff were working 14 hours a day , seven days a week , and " people stopped caring after 3 weeks . " 
 = = = Lamo approaches authorities , chat logs published = = = 
 Shortly after the first chat with Manning , Lamo discussed the information with Chet Uber of the volunteer group <unk> , which researches cybercrime , and with Timothy Webster , a friend who had worked in Army counterintelligence . Both advised Lamo to go to the authorities . His friend reported the conversation to United States Army Counterintelligence , and Lamo was contacted by counterintelligence agents shortly thereafter . He told them he believed Manning was endangering lives . He was largely ostracized by the hacker community afterwards . Nicks argues , on the other hand , that it was thanks to Lamo that the government had months to ameliorate any harm caused by the release of the diplomatic cables . 
 Lamo met with FBI and Army investigators on May 25 in California , and showed them the chat logs . On or around that date he also passed the story to Kevin Poulsen of Wired , and on May 27 gave him the chat logs and Manning 's name under embargo . He met with the FBI again that day , at which point they told him Manning had been arrested in Iraq the day before . Poulsen and Kim Zetter broke the news of the arrest in Wired on June 6 . Wired published around 25 percent of the chat logs on June 6 and 10 , and the full logs in July 2011 , after the material about Manning 's gender identity disorder had appeared elsewhere .

 Manning was arrested by the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division ( CID ) , on May 27 , 2010 , and transferred four days later to Camp <unk> in Kuwait . She was charged with several offenses in July , replaced by 22 charges in March 2011 , including violations of Articles 92 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) , and of the Espionage Act . The most serious charge was " aiding the enemy , " a capital offense , although prosecutors said they would not seek the death penalty . Another charge , which Manning 's defense called a " made up offense " but of which she was found guilty , read that Manning " wantonly [ caused ] to be published on the internet intelligence belonging to the US government , having knowledge that intelligence published on the internet is accessible to the enemy . " 
 = = = Detention = = = 
 While in Kuwait , Manning was placed on suicide watch after her behavior caused concern . She was moved from Kuwait to the Marine Corps Base Quantico , Virginia , on July 29 , 2010 , and classified as a maximum custody detainee with Prevention of Injury ( POI ) status . POI status is one stop short of suicide watch , entailing checks by guards every five minutes . Her lawyer , David Coombs , a former military attorney , said Manning was not allowed to sleep between 5 am ( 7 am on weekends ) and 8 pm , and was made to stand or sit up if she tried to . She was required to remain visible at all times , including at night , which entailed no access to sheets , no pillow except one built into her mattress , and a blanket designed not to be shredded . Manning complained that she regarded it as pretrial punishment . 
 Her cell was 6 × 12 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 x 3 @.@ 6 m ) with no window , containing a bed , toilet and sink . The jail had 30 cells built in a U shape , and although detainees could talk to one another , they were unable to see each other . Her lawyer said the guards behaved professionally , and had not tried to harass or embarrass Manning . She was allowed to walk for up to one hour a day , meals were taken in the cell , and she was shackled during visits . There was access to television when it was placed in the corridor , and she was allowed to keep one magazine and one book . Because she was in pretrial detention , she received full pay . 
 On January 18 , 2011 , after Manning had an altercation with the guards , the commander of Quantico classified her as a suicide risk . Manning said the guards had begun issuing conflicting commands , such as " turn left , don 't turn left , " and upbraiding her for responding to commands with " yes " instead of " aye . " Shortly afterwards , she was placed on suicide watch , had her clothing and eyeglasses removed , and was required to remain in her cell 24 hours a day . The suicide watch was lifted on January 21 after a complaint from her lawyer , and the brig commander who ordered it was replaced . On March 2 she was told that her request for removal of POI status — which entailed among other things sleeping wearing only boxer shorts — had been denied . Her lawyer said Manning joked to the guards that , if she wanted to harm herself , she could do so with her underwear or her flip @-@ flops . The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing . On the following morning only , Manning stood naked for inspection . Following her lawyer 's protest and media attention , Manning was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11 . 
 The detention conditions prompted national and international concern . Juan E. Mendez , United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture , told The Guardian that the U.S. government 's treatment of Manning was " cruel , inhuman and degrading . " In January 2011 Amnesty International asked the British government to intervene because of Manning 's status as a British citizen by descent , although Manning 's lawyer said Manning did not regard herself as a British citizen . The controversy claimed a casualty in March that year when State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley criticized Manning 's treatment and resigned two days later . In early April , 295 academics ( most of them American legal scholars ) signed a letter arguing that the treatment was a violation of the U.S. Constitution . On April 20 the Pentagon transferred Manning to the Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility , a new medium @-@ security facility at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , where she was placed in an 80 @-@ square @-@ foot cell with a window and a normal mattress , able to mix with other pretrial detainees and keep personal objects in her cell . 
 = = = Evidence presented at Article 32 hearing = = = 
 In April 2011 , a panel of experts , having completed a medical and mental evaluation of Manning , ruled that she was fit to stand trial . An Article 32 hearing , presided over by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Almanza , was convened on December 16 , 2011 , at Fort Meade , Maryland ; the hearing resulted in Almanza 's recommending that Manning be referred to a general court @-@ martial . She was arraigned on February 23 , 2012 , and declined to enter a plea . 
 During the Article 32 hearing , the prosecution , led by Captain <unk> Fein , presented 300 @,@ 000 pages of documents in evidence , including chat logs and classified material . The court heard from two Army investigators , Special Agent David Shaver , head of the digital forensics and research branch of the Army 's Computer Crime Investigative Unit ( <unk> ) ; and Mark Johnson , a digital forensics contractor from <unk> International , who works for the <unk> . They testified that they had found 100 @,@ 000 State Department cables on a workplace computer Manning had used between November 2009 and May 2010 ; 400 @,@ 000 military reports from Iraq and 91 @,@ 000 from Afghanistan on an SD card found in her basement room in her aunt 's home in Potomac , Maryland ; and 10 @,@ 000 cables on her personal MacBook Pro and storage devices that they said had not been passed to WikiLeaks because a file was corrupted . They also recovered 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats , in unallocated space on Manning 's MacBook hard drive , between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange . Two of the chat handles , which used the Berlin Chaos Computer Club 's domain ( <unk> ) , were associated with the names Julian Assange and Nathaniel Frank . 
 Johnson said he found SSH logs on the MacBook that showed an <unk> connection , from an IP address that resolved to Manning 's aunt 's home , to a Swedish IP address with links to WikiLeaks . Also found was a text file named " <unk> " , attached to the logs and apparently written by Manning to Assange , which called the Iraq and Afghan War logs " possibly one of the most significant documents of our time , removing the fog of war and revealing the true nature of 21st century asymmetric warfare . " The investigators testified they had also recovered an exchange from May 2010 between Manning and Eric <unk> , a Boston mathematician , in which Manning said she was the source of the Baghdad helicopter attack ( " Collateral Murder " ) video . Johnson said there had been two attempts to delete material from the MacBook . The operating system had been re @-@ installed in January 2010 , and on or around January 31 , 2010 , an attempt had been made to erase the hard drive by doing a " zero @-@ fill , " which involves overwriting material with zeroes . The material was recovered after the overwrite attempts from unallocated space . 
 Manning 's lawyers argued that the government had overstated the harm the release of the documents had caused , and had overcharged Manning to force her to give evidence against Assange . The defense also raised questions about whether Manning 's confusion over her gender identity affected her behavior and decision making . 
 = = = Guilty plea , trial , sentence = = = 
 The judge , Army Colonel Denise Lind , ruled in January 2013 that any sentence would be reduced by 112 days because of the treatment Manning received at Quantico . On February 28 , Manning pleaded guilty to 10 of the 22 charges . Reading for over an hour from a 35 @-@ page statement , she said she had leaked the cables " to show the true cost of war . " Prosecutors pursued a court @-@ martial on the remaining charges . 
 The trial began on June 3 , 2013 . Manning was convicted on July 30 , on 17 of the 22 charges in their entirety , including five counts of espionage and theft , and an amended version of four other charges ; she was acquitted of aiding the enemy . The sentencing phase began the next day . 
 Captain Michael Worsley , a military psychologist who had treated Manning before her arrest , testified that Manning had been left isolated in the Army , trying to deal with gender @-@ identity issues in a " hyper @-@ masculine environment . " David Moulton , a Navy forensic psychiatrist who saw Manning after the arrest , said Manning had narcissistic traits , and showed signs of both fetal alcohol syndrome and Asperger syndrome . He said that , in leaking the material , Manning had been " acting out [ a ] grandiose ideation . " 
 A defense psychiatrist , testifying to Manning 's motives , suggested a different agenda : 
 Well , <unk> Manning was under the impression that his leaked information was going to really change how the world views the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and future wars , actually . This was an attempt to crowdsource an analysis of the war , and it was his opinion that if ... through crowdsourcing , enough analysis was done on these documents , which he felt to be very important , that it would lead to a greater good ... that society as a whole would come to the conclusion that the war wasn 't worth it ... that really no wars are worth it . 
 On August 14 , Manning apologized to the court : " I am sorry that my actions hurt people . I 'm sorry that they hurt the United States . I am sorry for the unintended consequences of my actions . When I made these decisions I believed I was going to help people , not hurt people . ... At the time of my decisions I was dealing with a lot of issues . " 
 Manning 's offenses carried a maximum sentence of 90 years . The government asked for 60 years as a deterrent to others , while Manning 's lawyer asked for no more than 25 years . She was sentenced on August 21 to 35 years in prison , reduction in rank to private ( private E @-@ 1 or PVT ) , forfeiture of all pay and allowances , and a dishonorable discharge . She was given credit for 1 @,@ 293 days of pretrial confinement , including 112 days for her treatment at Quantico , and will be eligible for parole after serving one @-@ third of the sentence . There may also be additional credit for good behavior , which means she could be released after eight years . She is confined at the United States Disciplinary Barracks ( USDB ) at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas . 
 On April 14 , 2014 , Manning 's request for clemency was denied , as a result of which the case will go to the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals for further review . 
 = = = Request for presidential pardon = = = 
 On September 3 , 2013 , Manning 's lawyer applied for a presidential pardon for his client . Coombs filed a Petition for Pardon / Commutation of Sentence to President Obama through the pardon attorney at the Department of Justice and Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh . In the petition , which was filed with the legal name " Bradley Manning " and used male @-@ gender pronouns , Coombs contended that Manning 's disclosures did not cause any " real damage , " and that the documents in question did not merit protection as they were not sensitive . The request for a pardon included a supporting letter from Amnesty International which said that Manning 's leaks had exposed violations of human rights . Coombs 's letter touched on Manning 's role as a whistleblower , asking that Manning be granted a full pardon or that her sentence be reduced to time served .

 In April 2015 , Amnesty International posted online a letter from Manning in which she wrote , " I am now preparing for my court @-@ martial appeal before the first appeals court .

We have already had success in getting the court to respect my gender identity by using feminine pronouns in the court filings ( she , her , etc . ) . "

 The publication of the leaked material , particularly the diplomatic cables , attracted in @-@ depth coverage worldwide , with several governments blocking websites that contained embarrassing details . Alan <unk> , editor of The Guardian , said : " I can 't think of a time when there was ever a story generated by a news organisation where the White House , the Kremlin , Chávez , India , China , everyone in the world was talking about these things . ... I 've never known a story that created such mayhem that wasn 't an event like a war or a terrorist attack . " 
 United States Navy Admiral Michael Mullen , then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said the leaks had placed the lives of American soldiers and Afghan informants in danger . Journalist Glenn Greenwald argued that Manning was the most important whistleblower since Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971 . In an impromptu questioning session after a fundraiser , captured on a cell phone video , President Barack Obama said that Manning " broke the law " , which was later criticized as " unlawful command influence " on Manning 's upcoming trial . 
 Manning and WikiLeaks were credited as catalysts for the Arab Spring that began in December 2010 , when waves of protesters rose up against rulers across the Middle East and North Africa , after the leaked cables exposed government corruption . In Tunisia , where the uprisings began on December 17 , 2010 , one of the leaked cables — published around 10 days earlier — showed that the President 's daughter and her husband had their ice cream flown in from Saint @-@ Tropez . 
 A Washington Post editorial asked why an apparently unstable Army private had been able to access and transfer sensitive material in the first place . According to a biographer , Manning 's sexuality came into play by illustrating for the far right that gay people were unfit for military service , while the American mainstream thought of Manning as a gay soldier driven mad by bullying .

 In 2011 , Manning was awarded a " <unk> " by the German Section of the International Association of Lawyers against Nuclear Arms and the Federation of German Scientists . In 2012 , she was awarded " People 's Choice Award " awarded by Global Exchange . In 2013 , she was awarded the Sean MacBride Peace Prize by the International Peace Bureau . In 2014 , she was awarded the Sam Adams Award by Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence . 
 Icelandic and Swedish Pirate Party MPs nominated Manning and fellow whistleblower Edward Snowden for the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize . In a statement to the Nomination Committee , the Pirate Party members said Manning and Snowden " have inspired change and encouraged public debate and policy changes that contributed to a more stable and peaceful world " . In 2013 , Roots Action launched a petition nominating Manning for the prize that received more than 100 @,@ 000 supporting signatures . 
 In April 2015 a bronze statute of Manning , Edward Snowden , and Julian Assange was erected in Berlin 's Alexanderplatz . Germany 's Green Party sponsored the statue created by Italian sculptor David <unk> .

 On August 22 , 2013 , the day after sentencing , Manning 's attorney issued a press release to the Today show announcing that his client was a female , and asked that she be referred to by her new name of Chelsea and feminine pronouns . Manning 's statement included the following : 
 As I transition into this next phase of my life , I want everyone to know the real me . I am Chelsea Manning . I am a female . Given the way that I feel , and have felt since childhood , I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible . I hope that you will support me in this transition . I also request that , starting today , you refer to me by my new name and use the feminine pronoun ( except in official mail to the confinement facility ) . I look forward to receiving letters from supporters and having the opportunity to write back . 
 The news media split in its reaction to Manning 's request ; some organizations used the new name and pronouns , and others continued to use the former ones . Advocacy groups such as GLAAD , the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association , and the Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) encouraged media outlets to refer to Manning by her self @-@ identified name and pronoun .

 In April 2014 , the Kansas District Court considered a petition from Manning for a legal name change . The petition was granted that month . An Army spokesman stated that while the Army will update personnel records to acknowledge the name change , the military will continue to regard Manning as a male . Manning is seeking hormone therapy and the right to live as a woman while confined , consistent with her gender dysphoria , which has been confirmed by two Army medical specialists . Such treatment is provided in civilian federal prisons when it is found to be medically necessary , but it is not available in military prisons . The Pentagon policy considers transgender individuals ineligible to serve . 
 In July , the Federal Bureau of Prisons rejected a request by the Army to transfer Manning from the USDB to a civilian facility for treatment of her gender dysphoria . Instead , the Army will keep Manning in military custody and begin rudimentary gender treatment , which could include allowing her to wear female undergarments and possibly receive hormone treatments . No decision was announced regarding whether or not Manning will be transferred from the all @-@ male USDB to a female facility . 
 On August 12 , 2014 , the ACLU and Manning 's civilian attorney David Coombs said Manning was not receiving treatment for her gender identity condition as previously approved by Secretary of Defense Hagel . They notified the USDB , Hagel and other Defense Department officials that a lawsuit would be filed if they did not confirm by September 4 that treatment would be provided . On August 22 , Army spokeswoman Lt. Col. <unk> Conway told NBC News , " The Department of Defense has approved a request by Army leadership to provide required medical treatment for an inmate diagnosed with gender dysphoria . " Although Conway would not discuss " the medical needs of an individual , " she did say , " In general terms , the initial stages of treatment for individuals with gender dysphoria include psychotherapy and elements of the ' real life experience ' therapy . Treatment for the condition is highly individualized and generally is sequential and graduated . " The Army declined to say when treatment might begin . 
 In September , Manning filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Washington , D.C. , against Secretary of Defense Hagel , claiming she had " been denied access to medically necessary treatment " for gender disorder . She sued to be allowed to grow her hair longer and use cosmetics , and to receive hormone treatments " to express her female gender . " 
 = = = 2015 = = = 
 On February 12 , 2015 , USA Today reported that the commandant of the USDB wrote in a February 5 memo , " After carefully considering the recommendation that ( hormone treatment ) is medically appropriate and necessary , and weighing all associated safety and security risks presented , I approve adding ( hormone treatment ) to Inmate Manning 's treatment plan . " According to USA Today , Manning remained a soldier , and the decision to administer hormone therapy was a first for the Army . Manning was not allowed to grow her hair longer . Her ACLU attorney said that the delay in approving her hormone treatment " came with a significant cost to Chelsea and her mental health . " 
 On March 5 , in response to Manning 's request for an order compelling the military to use pronouns that conform to her chosen gender identity , the U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals ruled , " Reference to appellant in all future formal papers filed before this court and all future orders and decisions issued by this court shall either be neutral , e.g. , Private First Class Manning or appellant , or employ a feminine pronoun . " 
 On March 14 , the digital library host <unk> posted an unsigned public copy of a court document , filed March 10 , wherein the parties to Manning 's September 2014 lawsuit against Secretary of Defense Hagel agreed to stay proceedings for seven months , after which time they would address how the litigation should proceed in light of Manning 's status at that time . The document revealed that the Army was then providing Manning with weekly psychotherapy , including psychotherapy specific to gender dysphoria ; cross @-@ sex hormone therapy ; female undergarments ; the ability to wear prescribed cosmetics in her daily life at the USDB ; and speech therapy . 
 In April 2015 , Amnesty International posted online a letter from Manning in which she disclosed , 
 I finally began my prescribed regime of hormones to continue my overdue gender transition in February . It 's been such an amazing relief for my body and brain to finally come into alignment with each other . My stress and anxiety levels have tapered off quite considerably . Overall , things are beginning to move along nicely .

 In March 2015 , Bloomberg News reported that Manning can be visited only by those she had named before her imprisonment , and not by journalists . She cannot be photographed or give interviews on camera . Manning is not allowed to browse the web , but consults print news and has access to new gender theory texts . 
 In April 2015 , Amnesty International posted online a letter from Manning in which she described her daily life . " My days here are busy and very routine , " Manning wrote . " I am taking college correspondence courses for a bachelor 's degree . I also work out a lot to stay fit , and read newspapers , magazines and books to keep up @-@ to @-@ date on current events around the world and learn new things . " 
 Also that month , Cosmopolitan published the first interview with Manning in prison , conducted by mail . Cosmo reported that Manning is optimistic about recent progress but says not being allowed to grow her hair long is " painful and awkward … I am torn up . I get through each day okay , but at night , when I 'm alone in my room , I finally burn out and crash . " Manning said it was " very much a relief " to announce that she is a woman , and did not fear the public response . " Honestly , I 'm not terribly worried about what people out there might think of me . I just try to be myself . " According to Cosmo , Manning has her own cell with " two tall vertical windows that face the sun , " and can see " trees and hills and blue sky and all the things beyond the buildings and razor wire . " Manning denies being harassed by other inmates , and claims some have become confidantes .

In 2014 , The Guardian had published two op @-@ eds by Manning : " How to make Isis fall on its own sword " ( September 16 ) and " I am a transgender woman and the government is denying my civil rights " ( December 8 ) . Manning 's debut under the new arrangement , " The CIA 's torturers and the leaders who approved their actions must face the law , " appeared on March 9 , 2015 .

 = Action of 25 September 1806 = 
 The Action of 25 September 1806 was a naval battle fought during the Napoleonic Wars off the French Biscay port of Rochefort . A French squadron comprising five frigates and two corvettes , sailing to the French West Indies with supplies and reinforcements , was intercepted by a British squadron of six ships of the line that was keeping a close blockade of the port as part of the Atlantic campaign of 1806 . The British ships , under the command of Commodore Sir Samuel Hood , spotted the French convoy early in the morning of 25 September , just a few hours after the French had left port , and immediately gave chase . Although the French ships tried to escape , they were heavily laden with troops and stores , and the strong winds favoured the larger ships of the line , which caught the French convoy after a five @-@ hour pursuit , although they had become separated from one another during the chase . 
 At 05 : 00 the leading British ship , HMS Monarch , was within range and opened fire on the French squadron , which divided . One frigate went north and was intercepted by HMS Mars , while another , accompanied by the two corvettes , turned south and managed to outrun HMS Windsor Castle . The main body of the French force remained together and met the attack of Monarch and the British flagship HMS Centaur with their broadsides . Although outnumbered and outclassed by the British squadron the French ships fought hard , inflicting damage on the leading British ships and severely wounding Commodore Hood . Eventually the strength of the British squadron told , and despite a fierce resistance the French ships surrendered one by one , the British capturing four of the seven vessels in the squadron . 
 = = Background = = 
 The principal naval campaign of 1806 was fought in the Atlantic Ocean , following a raid by two large French battle squadrons on British trade routes , focused particularly on the Caribbean . The security of the French Caribbean was under severe threat during the wars , as the Royal Navy dominated the region and restricted French movements both between the islands and between the West Indies and France itself . This dominance was enforced by rigorous blockade , in which British ships attempted to ensure that no French military or commercial vessel was able to enter or leave French harbours both in Europe and in the French colonies . In the Caribbean , this strategy was designed to destroy the economies and morale of the French West Indian territories in preparation for attack by British expeditionary forces . To counter this strategy , the French government repeatedly sent convoys and individual warships to the French Caribbean islands with supplies of food , military equipment and reinforcements . These resupply efforts ranged from small individual corvettes to large battle squadrons and were under orders to avoid conflict wherever possible . Despite these orders , many were intercepted by British blockade forces , either in the Caribbean or off the French coast itself . 
 The largest French resupply effort of the Napoleonic Wars was a squadron under Contre @-@ Admiral Corentin @-@ Urbain Leissègues , sent to Santo Domingo in December 1805 with troops and supplies . In conjunction with a second squadron under Vice @-@ Admiral Jean @-@ Baptiste Willaumez , this force was then ordered to raid British trade routes and disrupt the movement of British merchant shipping across the Atlantic . Leissègues reached Santo Domingo in February 1806 , but within days a British battle squadron had intercepted and destroyed his force at the Battle of San Domingo . Willaumez was able to avoid attack by British forces during the spring of 1806 , and cruised in the Caribbean during much of the summer , but his force was eventually dispersed by a hurricane in August and the survivors forced to shelter on the American Eastern Seaboard . Unaware of the dispersal of Willaumez 's squadron , the British naval authorities sought to block its return to Europe by stationing strong battle squadrons off the principal French Atlantic ports . One of their most important targets was the city of Rochefort , heavily fortified port in which a powerful French naval force was based , and a squadron of six Royal Navy ships of the line was assigned to watch it in case Willaumez attempted to return there . In August , command of the blockade squadron was awarded to Commodore Sir Samuel Hood , a highly experience naval commander . 
 In Rochefort , an expedition was planned to carry supplies to the French West Indies while the British were distracted by Willaumez 's operations . Assigned to the operation was Commodore Eleonore @-@ Jean @-@ Nicolas Soleil , an officer who had served on Allemand 's expedition , a successful operation the year before . To carry the supplies and reinforcements , Soleil was provided with seven ships : Four large modern frigates rated at 40 @-@ guns but actually carrying 44 – 46 , a smaller and older frigate of 36 guns and two small corvettes of 16 guns each . All of the ships were heavily laden , each carrying as many as 650 men , but it was hoped that their size and speed would allow them to defeat anything smaller than they were and to escape anything larger . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Soleil 's squadron departed Rochefort on the evening of 24 September , aiming to bypass Hood 's squadron in the dark . However at 01 : 00 on 25 September , with the wind coming from the northeast , lookouts on HMS Monarch spotted sails to the east . Hood 's squadron was spread out , tacking southeast towards the <unk> Lighthouse at Saint @-@ Denis @-@ d <unk> with HMS Centaur in the centre , HMS Revenge to the east ( or windward ) and Monarch to the west . HMS Mars was also close by , with the rest of the squadron spread out in the rear . Hood 's immediate reaction was that the sails must belong to a squadron of French ships of the line , and ordered his ships to form a line of battle in anticipation . Even as the signal was raised however , lookouts on Monarch identified the strangers as frigates and Hood abandoned his previous orders and raised a new signal ordering a general chase , confident that his ships could destroy the convoy even without the power and defensive capability of a line of battle . 
 As soon as Soleil realised that he had been spotted he gave orders for his ships to sail to the southwest as fast as possible , hoping to outdistance the British squadron . However his convoy were all heavily laden and were therefore slower than they would normally be , while the heavy swell and strong winds favoured the large ships of the line . The chase continued throughout the night , until by 04 : 00 Monarch was clearly gaining on the convoy , with Centaur 8 nautical miles ( 15 km ) behind . At 05 : 00 , Captain Richard Lee was close enough to fire his bow @-@ chasers , small guns situated at the front of his ship , at the rearmost French frigate , the Armide . Captain Jean @-@ Jacques @-@ Jude Langlois returned the fire with his stern @-@ chasers and the French ships raised the Tricolour in anticipation of battle . Recognising that he was facing an overwhelming British force , Soleil split his ships , sending Thétis and the corvettes Lynx and Sylphe southwards and Infatigable to the north . This had limited success in achieving the desired effect of dividing the pursuit , with Captain William Lukin taking HMS Mars out of the British line in pursuit of Infatigable while the slow HMS Windsor Castle was sent after the three south bound ships , but the main body of the Royal Navy squadron remained on course . 
 At 10 : 00 , Soleil accepted that his remaining ships would rapidly be overhauled by Monarch and drew them together , forming a compact group with which to receive the British attack . He also ordered his captains to focus their fire on the enemy sails , rigging and masts , hoping to inflict enough damage to delay the pursuit and allow his force to escape . Within minutes Monarch was heavily engaged with Armide and Minerve but Captain Lee found himself at a disadvantage : the heavy swell that has suited his ship during the chase also prevented him from opening his lower gunports in case of flooding . This halved his available cannon and as a result his isolated ship began to suffer severe damage to its rigging and sails from the frigates ' gunnery . Within 20 minutes , Monarch was unable to <unk> , but Lee continued fighting until Centaur could reach the melee , the flagship opening fire at 11 : 00 . Hood passed the battling Monarch and Minerve , concentrating his fire on Armide and the flagship Gloire . For another 45 minutes the battle continued , Centaur suffering damage to her rigging and sails from the French shot and taking casualties from musket fire from the soldiers carried aboard . Among the wounded was Commodore Hood , who was shot in the right forearm , the ball eventually lodging in his shoulder . Hood retired below and command passed to his second in command , Lieutenant Case . 
 At 11 : 45 , Armide surrendered to Centaur , followed 15 minutes later by Minerve . Both ships had suffered heavy damage and casualties in the unequal engagement and could not hope to continue their resistance with the rest of the British squadron rapidly approaching . To the north , Infatigable had failed to outrun Mars and Captain Lukin forced the frigate to surrender after a brief cannonade . With three ships lost and the other three long disappeared to the south , Soleil determined to flee westwards , hoping the damage he had inflicted on Centaur 's sails was sufficient to prevent her pursuit . However , Gloire had also been damaged and could not distance herself from the British flagship sufficiently before support arrived in the form of Mars . With his ship undamaged , Lukin was able to easily catch the fleeing frigate and opened fire at 14 : 30 , combat continuing for half an hour before Soleil surrendered , his frigate badly damaged . To the south , Windsor Castle had proven far too slow to catch the smaller French ships , which had easily outrun the second rate and escaped . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 It took some time for the British squadron to effect repairs on their ships and prizes in preparation for the journey back to Britain . They had suffered light casualties of nine killed and 29 wounded , but among the more seriously injured was Hood , whose arm had been amputated during the battle . [ Note A ] French losses were much heavier but are unknown : Hood did not include them in his official report but promised to provide them soon afterwards in a follow up letter , which , if it was written , has never been located . All four of the captured frigates were large new vessels that were immediately purchased for service in the Royal Navy , Gloire and Armide retaining their names while Infatigable became HMS <unk> and Minerve became HMS Alceste . Although Hood and his men were commended at the time , subsequent historical focus has been on the bravery of the inexperienced French crews in resisting an attack by an overwhelming force for so long . William James wrote in 1827 of the " gallant conduct on the part of the French ships " and William Laird Clowes , writing in 1900 stated that " The resistance offered by the French to a force so superior was in every way credible " . 
 Within days of the action Hood had been promoted to rear @-@ admiral and awarded a pension of £ 500 a year , but despite his wound he continued in service , fighting a notable action with Russian ships in the Baltic Sea in 1807 and later operating off the Spanish coast in the early Peninsular War . French efforts to resupply their West Indian colonies continued throughout the next three years , costing a heavy toll of men and ships lost to the British blockade . By 1808 , the situation in the French Caribbean had become desperate and the French increased their supply convoys , losing five frigates and a ship of the line in failed reinforcement efforts during late 1808 and early 1809 . The weakened colonies were unable to resist British attack , and co @-@ ordinated invasions forced the surrender of first Martinique in January 1809 and Guadeloupe a year later , Cayenne and Santo Domingo also falling to British , Spanish and Portuguese forces .

 = Our Father ( Dexter ) = 
 " Our Father " is the third season premiere and twenty @-@ fifth overall episode of the American television drama series Dexter , which first aired on September 28 , 2008 on Showtime in the United States . The episode was written by Clyde Phillips and directed by Keith Gordon . In the episode , which takes place several months after the second season finale , Dexter Morgan ( Michael C. Hall ) mistakenly kills an innocent man but forms a friendship with the man 's brother , well @-@ known assistant district attorney Miguel Prado ( Jimmy Smits ) . Dexter 's sister Debra ( Jennifer Carpenter ) , meanwhile , has turned over a new leaf in her life and is determined to become a detective . 
 To carry the remainder of the third season , Dexter 's writers introduced Miguel as a new character so that his relationship with Dexter could serve as a " central arc " . In order to allow them to explore Dexter 's psychological and emotional reactions , the writers revealed Dexter 's girlfriend Rita Bennett ( Julie Benz ) to be pregnant . They also had Dexter kill an innocent person to develop the ongoing theme of rebellion despite initially rejecting the idea of Dexter killing " somebody who doesn 't deserve it " . Filming of the episode began in early June in Los Angeles , California at Sunset Gower Studios , though a small crew flew to Miami , Florida , where the show is set , to film short pieces of Dexter , which were integrated into " Our Father " and other episodes . The episode brought in 1 @.@ 22 million viewers , an improvement from second season 's premiere and finale , and attracted mixed reviews from critics .

 Several months after the deaths of his colleague Sgt. James Doakes and his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor Lila Tournay ( Jaime Murray ) , Dexter 's life has returned to normal . He looks up a drug dealer , Fred " Freebo " Bowman ( Mike Erwin ) , whom he believes to have killed two female college students . Pretending to want to buy heroin , Dexter visits Freebo 's house , where he sees Freebo 's girlfriend <unk> Campbell ( Jelly Howie ) . He returns to the house at night and finds Freebo fighting with another man ( Nick <unk> ) . When the man attacks Dexter , Dexter stabs and kills him in self @-@ defense . Dexter flees , shocked about breaking his father Harry 's " code " and killing an innocent person . He is called to the scene the following day and discovers that the man was Oscar Prado , the brother of well @-@ known assistant district attorney Miguel Prado . Miguel seeks an explanation and consolation from Dexter , and invites him to Oscar 's wake . Dexter attends , leaving Debra alone on their dead father 's birthday . He begins to question Harry 's code and whether his loyalty is necessary . 
 In the police department , Det . Angel Batista ( David Zayas ) is promoted to a sergeant . Debra has changed her hairstyle and given up men , alcohol and cigarettes . Det . Joey Quinn ( Desmond Harrington ) , recently transferred to the department , is being investigated by Internal Affairs . Sgt. Yuki Amado ( Liza <unk> ) asks Debra repeatedly to keep an eye on Quinn , but Debra declines even when she discovers that " snitching " may earn her a detective 's shield . She discovers from one of Quinn 's informants , Anton Briggs ( David Ramsey ) , that Oscar was a drug addict , but after she loudly divulges the information in Miguel 's presence , Lt. María LaGuerta ( Lauren Vélez ) asks that Batista remove her from the case . Batista does so and instead puts her on the case of a " Jane Doe " , who Dexter recognizes as <unk> . 
 Dexter 's personal life is going well ; his relationship with Rita has become more amorous and he is bonding with her children , Astor ( Christina Robinson ) and Cody ( Preston Bailey ) . Rita craves chocolate pudding and , recalling the last instance of this , realizes that she is pregnant . 
 = = Production = = 
 Dexter 's writing staff began meeting in March 2008 to brainstorm ideas for the third season 's storylines . Writer Clyde Phillips said that , when the writers decided to open season 3 with the revelation of Rita 's pregnancy , " we were thinking about how it would affect Dexter psychologically and emotionally to create a life when he has spent most of his adult life taking lives . " They chose to introduce Miguel as a new character with the intention for his and Dexter 's relationship to be " the central arc of the season " , according to Hall . Smits was the only actor who was considered for the role of Miguel . Smits was not initially interested in joining the cast , but after Phillips explained Miguel 's dark side to him , Smits accepted the job offer because it was an opportunity to play a character dissimilar to any he had played before . He said , " They promised upfront that this was really going to challenge me , that it would be stuff that I haven 't done before , and they 've really given me a shot . They 've delivered the goods . " In regard to Dexter 's abandonment of Harry 's Code , Hall said that " That need to rebel is a real engine for what unfolds this season . " Smits was hired to appear in ten of the season 's twelve episodes . When asked at the beginning of the second season whether there was any possibility of Dexter killing an innocent person , show runner Daniel Cerone said that by not doing so , they were " protecting the character " . He thought that it was " very important for the show that he does kill people who deserve it " . Phillips said that " We don 't want him knowingly killing somebody who doesn 't deserve it out of impulse or something , but we have explored the notion of his having killed someone without properly vetting that person and perhaps making a mistake . " 
 Production was scheduled to commence in late May , but was delayed until early June . A small crew flew to Miami with Hall and , according to producer Sara Colleton , filmed " a lot of pieces — not just Dexter walking in and out of his door or car , but also scenes that we know we 'll need and can use " , before returning to the show 's permanent sets at Sunset Gower Studios in Los Angeles .

 " Our Father " received mixed reviews from critics ; some thought that it was dull , though Smits ' performance received widespread critical acclaim .

The Australian 's Stephen <unk> felt that , with the beginning of the third season , " Dexter has gone from an eight to a six " on a scale of one to ten , saying that the show " has lost its edge " with the hypocrisy of Dexter being a supposed sociopath despite holding several relationships . Los Angeles Times critic Claire Zulkey was " not sure yet whether [ the third season 's changes are ] good " . Ray Ellis of Blogcritics felt that " the series has settled into a state of complacency " and could not " escape the feeling I 've seen this before " .

Perry discussed her role with Bliss magazine : " My vocals are actually on Breakout . I thought , ' Yes , I 'm singing on a Miley single ' . " Cyrus said naming the album Breakout was influenced by the song as it was " one of [ her ] favorite songs " on the album ; this was because the song is feminine but has appeals to different age groups : " Moms , dads , sisters , brothers can , you know , relate to it .

 = Bank Street ( football ground ) = 
 Bank Street , known for a time as Bank Lane , was a multi @-@ purpose stadium in Clayton , Manchester , England . It was mostly used for football matches and was the second home ground of Manchester United Football Club ( then known as Newton Heath Football Club ) , after North Road , which they left in 1893 . The stadium had a capacity of around 50 @,@ 000 , but the club moved to Old Trafford in 1910 because club owner John Henry Davies believed he could not sufficiently expand the ground . 
 The stadium was in poor repair towards the end of its life and , shortly after the club moved out to Old Trafford , the main stand at Bank Street blew down in a storm . The site is now occupied by the car park of the Manchester Velodrome , with a plaque on a house wall on Bank Street indicating the presence of the former ground . The site is close to the City of Manchester Stadium , the home of Manchester City Football Club . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Also known as Bank Lane , the ground was located on Bank Street in the Manchester suburb of Clayton , opposite the junction with Ravensbury Street and between the railway line and the Albion Chemical works . Known locally as the Bradford and Clayton athletic ground , it was owned by the Bradford and Clayton Athletic Company . After Newton Heath F.C. ( who became Manchester United in 1902 ) were evicted from their old ground at North Road by the Manchester Deans and Canons , who believed it to be inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground , secretary A. H. <unk> procured the use of the Bank Street ground in June 1893 . The site was let to the club for eight months of the year , with pre @-@ season training permitted on occasional nights in the summer . The ground was without stands , but , by the start of the 1893 – 94 season , two stands had been built ; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the " Bradford end " . At the opposite end , the " Clayton end " , the ground had been " built up , thousands thus being provided for " . 
 Newton Heath 's first Football League match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893 , when 10 @,@ 000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat @-@ trick , Newton Heath 's only goals in a 3 – 2 win . The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later . However , Newton Heath did not fare well in their first season at the new ground and were unable to retain their First Division status at the end of the season , finishing bottom of the 16 @-@ team division . At the time , the condition of the Bank Street pitch was well documented . On one occasion during the 1894 – 95 season , Walsall Town Swifts turned up at the ground and were greeted by what they regarded as a " toxic waste dump " . After lodging an official complaint about the pitch to the referee , they were finally persuaded to take to the field , only to be beaten 14 – 0 ( unofficially , the biggest win in the history of Manchester United ) . However , the Football League ruled in favour of Walsall and the match was ordered to be replayed , though the result was not much better for the visitors the second time round , this time losing 9 – 0 . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 In October 1895 , before the visit of Manchester City to Bank Street , the club purchased a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity stand from Broughton Rangers Rugby League Club , and put up another stand on the " reserved side " ( as distinct from the " popular side " ) . However , weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12 @,@ 000 . Improvements to the ground were restricted by the running track that encompassed the pitch , which , by the request of the Bradford and Clayton Athletic Company , could not be removed . However , the ground came into the possession of the club 's former president , Mr W. Crompton , in 1898 , allowing them to make whatever improvements to it they desired . One report in the Manchester Courier predicted the addition of a 25 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) tall stand on the side adjacent to Bank Street itself , with a refreshment stand underneath , while the opposite stand would be moved back 6 yards ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) and raised up on brickwork by around 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) , with the space underneath to be used as changing rooms for the players and referee and various rooms for the club committee . 
 These improvements would cost a lot of money , however , and this , in combination with the players ' ever @-@ increasing wages , sent the club into a period of financial turmoil . The club was presented with a winding up order in January 1902 , and Bank Street was on the brink of being repossessed until they were saved at the eleventh hour by a wealthy local brewer , John Henry Davies . He and four other men , among them club captain Harry Stafford , invested a total of £ 2 @,@ 000 in the club , now renamed Manchester United F.C. , and Davies himself paid £ 500 for the erection of a new 1 @,@ 000 @-@ seat stand at Bank Street . Within four years , the stadium had cover on all four sides , as well as the ability to hold approximately 50 @,@ 000 spectators , some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand . The stadium was even deemed worthy enough to host a match between Football League and Scottish Football League representative sides in April 1904 , hosting 25 @,@ 000 spectators as the Football League side won 2 – 1 . 
 Around the turn of the 20th century , Newton Heath pulled off a significant coup by persuading the Manchester Evening News to set up an office at Bank Street . In response to Manchester City 's relationship with the Manchester Evening Chronicle , the Heathens ' believed that their partnership with the Evening News would cultivate interest in the club , while the newspaper would benefit from increased coverage of football . 
 = = = Departure and destruction = = = 
 Following Manchester United 's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later , it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies ' ambition and the club would have to move to a new stadium five miles away in Old Trafford . Bank Street was sold to the Manchester Corporation for £ 5 @,@ 500 and leased back to the club on a monthly basis until the new stadium was complete . Bank Street played host to just 5 @,@ 000 spectators for its final game on 22 January 1910 ; a 5 – 0 home win over Tottenham Hotspur . Manchester United 's move away from Bank Street seemed to have come at the perfect time , as , only a few days after the Tottenham match , one of the stands was blown down in a storm . The roof of the grandstand was blown across the road , landing on the houses opposite , and the stand was left in tatters . The Tottenham match was meant to have been played at Old Trafford , but building problems at the new ground had caused the fixture to revert to Bank Street . Despite the destruction of the Bank Street End stand , the club 's reserve team continued to use the ground for matches until the expiry of the lease on 1 January 1912 . The remaining timber at the site was then sold to <unk> Bros. for £ 275 . The site had various industrial uses for the next 80 years , until it was cleared for inclusion in the new Manchester Velodrome in the early 1990s . The actual site occupied by the stadium now serves as the Velodrome car park , while a red plaque attached to a house opposite marks the site as part of United 's history . 
 = Juan Larrea ( politician ) = 
 Juan Larrea ( June 24 , 1782 in Catalonia , Spain – June 20 , 1847 in Buenos Aires ) was a Spanish businessman and politician in Buenos Aires during the early nineteenth century . He headed a military unit during the second British invasion of the Río de la Plata , and worked at the Buenos Aires Cabildo . He took part in the ill @-@ fated Mutiny of Álzaga . Larrea and Domingo Matheu were the only two Spanish @-@ born members of the Primera Junta , the first national government of Argentina . 
 He supported the secretary Mariano Moreno within the Junta , and was moved to the distant city of San Juan when the Morenists were removed from government . He returned as a deputy for Córdoba in the Assembly of Year XIII constituent assembly , promoting many resolutions . Together with Carlos María de Alvear , he organized the strategy for the downfall of the royalist stronghold in Montevideo , a threat to Buenos Aires during the Argentine War of Independence . Despite the victory , he faced political conflicts with admiral William Brown and an economic crisis , and was exiled from the country . 
 He moved to Bordeaux , France , but returned to Buenos Aires when his exile was lifted by the Oblivion law . He served as consul for a time , but his business declined and he committed suicide on June 20 , 1847 . He was the last surviving member of the Primera Junta . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life and Viceroyalty = = = 
 Juan Larrea was born on June 24 , 1782 , in the city of Mataró , Catalonia . His father was Martín Ramón de Larrea , who was in charge of customs operations in Mataró , and his mother was <unk> <unk> . He studied mathematics and navigation , and focused his education towards a career in commerce . His father died in 1793 , so Larrea became the patriarch of the family . They moved to Buenos Aires , where he established a warehouse for wines , leather , and sugar . He traded with Peru , Upper Peru , Paraguay , Chile and colonial Brazil . By 1806 he was a well respected businessman , and a syndic of the Royal Consulate . He promoted the role of deputies from Buenos Aires at the Madrid court , to better the representation of the Brazilian viceroyalty and reduce the privileges of peninsular merchants . 
 Buenos Aires and other nearby cities faced the British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806 and 1807 . In the absence of reinforcements from Spain , viceroy Santiago de Liniers arranged that everyone in Buenos Aires capable of bearing arms should join the resistance against the second invasion . Larrea established the Legion of Catalan Volunteers with Jaime Nadal y Guarda , Jaime <unk> and José Olaguer Reynals . Larrea was appointed captain of this military unit . The defense was successful , and the British were driven away from the viceroyalty . 
 Larrea 's business prospered , and in 1808 the Buenos Aires Cabildo appointed him to oversee a naval patrol to suppress shipments of contraband . This gave him an opportunity to put his nautical skills to use . He also participated in the secret meetings of patriots who promoted political change , and joined the 1809 Mutiny of Álzaga , which attempted to depose viceroy Liniers and replace him with a Junta . The mutiny failed , but the patriots continued to plot , and in 1810 the May Revolution succeeded in deposing the new viceroy . Larrea did not take part in the discussions at the open cabildo , but was appointed as member of the Primera Junta . 
 = = = Primera Junta = = = 
 Larrea 's prestige as an influential businessman promoted his appointment as member of the Primera Junta . However , as with the other members , the precise reasons for his inclusion are unclear . The Junta 's membership has been considered a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists . Larrea resigned his wages from his position as Junta member , and organized the resources for the upcoming war of independence . Together with Manuel de Sarratea he drafted a new code regulating business in Argentina , and he also secured the exile of former viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros by bribing the captain of the ship carrying him , the Dart , to avoid any landfall until reaching the Canary Islands on the far side of the Atlantic . He supported the execution of Liniers after the defeat of his counter @-@ revolution , and supported the secretary Mariano Moreno against the president Cornelio Saavedra . Larrea voted for the incorporation of deputies from other cities into the Junta , although he had previously indicated his opposition to the proposal . It was intended by Saavedra that this change would reduce Moreno 's influence within the Junta . 
 The proposal prevailed , and the Primera Junta became the Junta Grande by incorporating the new deputies . The resignation and death of Mariano Moreno did not reduce the conflicts between Morenists and Saavedrists . A rebellion on behalf of <unk> ensued , on 5 and 6 April 1811 , aiming at the resignation of all remaining Morenists , including Larrea . Larrea was accused of joining factions and risking public security , and was deposed . Taken prisoner , he was moved to the nearby city of Luján , and then to the distant San Juan . 
 = = = Return to politics = = = 
 Larrea resumed business activities in San Juan , avoiding politics until 1812 . The Revolution of October 8 , 1812 returned the Morenists to power , and so Larrea could return to Buenos Aires . He returned as a deputy for Córdoba to the Assembly of Year XIII constituent assembly . 
 In the assembly , Larrea promoted a customs law which taxed most imports , but made exceptions for machines , scientific tools , books , weapons and military supplies . He organized a local mint , and the supply of the Army of the North . The presidency of the assembly rotated , and Larrea presided from April 30 to June 1 , 1813 . During this time the Assembly outlawed torture and repealed all noble titles , and also chose the official Argentine National Anthem . 
 Larrea served briefly in the Second Triumvirate , replacing José Julián Pérez as finance minister , until the Assembly replaced the Triumvirate with the Supreme Director , an office placing the powers of head of state in the hands of one person . Gervasio Antonio de Posadas was chosen as the first Supreme Director . Posadas was concerned about Montevideo , a nearby city which had been under royalist control since the beginning of the war , and a constant threat to Buenos Aires . Carlos María de Alvear complemented the existing siege of Montevideo with a naval blockade , in which Larrea 's expertise was instrumental . Alvear developed the military strategy , and Larrea took care of the financial aspects . Larrea drafted a report of the nature , costs and strength of the proposed navy , and the captains and sailors that were required , and planned to negotiate with the American William White . Larrea also appointed the Irish admiral William Brown to lead the attack . The royalist forces in Montevideo were finally defeated in June , 1814 . 
 Larrea did not get on well with Brown , who blamed him for <unk> and supply shortages , and even for discontent among the sailors . Buenos Aires did not have a naval tradition , and therefore most of the people involved in the naval campaign were foreigners . As a result , their commitment to the war was often limited . After the capture of Montevideo , Larrea instructed Brown to report directly to the minister of war , and not correspond with himself . Nevertheless , the disagreements continued . Due to the economic crisis caused by the war , Larrea sold the captured ships , decommissioned the navy and sold off the government 's own ships , but the sailors complained that they had not received their wages , their reward for the military victory nor their percentage of the sale of the captured ships . Larrea and White were blamed for this . Larrea resigned by the end of the year , after signing an order for the creation of an infantry and a cavalry regiment for the Army of the Andes . Larrea blamed White for the unresolved dispute over the sailors ' wages , declaring that he had arranged that White would organize the payment of the wages . Alvear resigned in 1815 after the mutiny of Álvarez Thomas , and all the members of his administration were put on trial . Larrea was accused of abuse of power , administrative fraud and stealing from the national treasury . All his properties were confiscated , and he was exiled . 
 = = = Exile and return = = = 
 After his exile , Larrea moved to Bordeaux in France , and did business with some of his old associates . He continued correspondence with Bernardino Rivadavia , and in 1818 he moved to Montevideo , under Brazilian control at that time , and strengthened his contacts in Buenos Aires from there . He was finally able to return to Buenos Aires in 1822 due to the oblivion law . 
 Once he returned to Buenos Aires , Larrea avoided political activities and concentrated on business activities . He established a mailing service between Buenos Aires and Le Havre ( France ) , but the venture failed . He then worked in animal husbandry , both in Buenos Aires and in Montevideo . He was appointed consul of the United Provinces by governor Manuel Dorrego , and moved back to Bordeaux to strengthen commerce with France . 
 He resigned as consul in 1830 , shortly after the first appointment of Juan Manuel de Rosas as governor , and returned to private business once more . His business began to fail , and he lived at various times in Montevideo , Colonia del Sacramento and Bordeaux , before returning again to Buenos Aires . He committed suicide on June 20 , 1847 . He was the last surviving member of the Primera Junta . 
 = Transformers : Fall of Cybertron = 
 Transformers : Fall of Cybertron is a third @-@ person shooter video game developed by High Moon Studios and published by Activision . It is the sequel to the 2010 video game Transformers : War for Cybertron , and directly follows the events of that game as the Autobots struggle to defeat their Decepticon foes in a war for their home planet of Cybertron . The game was released on August 21 , 2012 , in North America and on August 24 , 2012 , in Europe for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 . 
 The game tells the story of the Transformers , fictional robotic life forms , and the final days of conflict on their home planet of Cybertron . An origins subplot for the Dinobots is also told , reimagined from the Transformers : Generation 1 continuity . Other subplots also tell an adapted story for several characters . Some of the voice cast from the 1984 series The Transformers return to reprise their roles , including Peter Cullen as Autobot leader Optimus Prime and Gregg Berger as Grimlock . Other actors return to reprise their roles from Transformers : War for Cybertron . 
 Fall of Cybertron received generally favorable reviews from critics . The Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 versions have an aggregate Metacritic score of 79 / 100 , while the PlayStation 3 version holds a score of 77 / 100 . Critics generally felt that the game was true to the Transformers franchise and provided good fan service , but some thought that the story pace slowed at times . Gameplay was mostly praised , but some reviewers cited the removal of War for Cybertron 's cooperative campaign as a low point . Graphics and audio also received broadly positive comments , though some reviewers noticed frame rate issues with the PlayStation 3 version . A tie in titled Transformers : Rise of the Dark Spark , which is partially set between War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron was released June 24 , 2014 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Transformers : Fall of Cybertron , like its predecessor Transformers : War for Cybertron , is a third @-@ person shooter . Players can control each transformer in both its robot and alternate forms . Instead of a traditional health system , the game features a system similar to the Halo series of video games . The player character has both a regenerating shield and health , the latter of which can be replenished by a health pack . The weapon selection in Fall of Cybertron is expanded , with new weapons that can take on very significant upgrades , including one that allows a weapon to fire up to 75 % faster . These are purchased through <unk> 1 kiosks found throughout the game . 
 Every character has been given their own unique ability . For example , Jazz can fire a grappling hook to reach high or distant places , Optimus Prime can command the massive Metroplex , and the Combaticons have the ability to combine into the Decepticon Bruticus . Segments in which players control Bruticus are designed to accommodate its larger size . Scale is maintained so the character towers over enemies . The Autobot Grimlock , who transforms into a dinosaur , is controlled differently than other characters . Carrying only a sword and shield , Grimlock cannot transform at will , instead accumulating rage as he battles opponents . When he gains enough rage , Grimlock is able to transform and inflict massive damage . The online cooperative campaign play featured in the first game has been removed in favor of levels that utilize each character 's specific abilities . 
 The survival mode Escalation from War for Cybertron returns . In this mode players must defend against increasingly difficult waves of enemies . As gameplay progresses , new sections of the level open , which give players access to upgraded weapons and abilities . Franchise characters are used in Escalation , while players can customize one of four character classes — Scientist , Infiltrator , Destroyer , and Titan — in competitive multiplayer . Autobot and Decepticon Transformers can be customized with parts earned through a ranking system or purchased through the game 's marketplace . Several parts from famous Transformers can be used , such as heads , torsos , legs , and arms . Hundreds of pieces and color options are available . Players can also buy and upgrade their gear .

 Transformers : Fall of Cybertron is a direct continuation of Transformers : War for Cybertron . Giant robotic life forms known as Transformers are at civil war . Two factions , the Autobots and the Decepticons , vie for control of their home world , Cybertron . The events of the previous game have left the planet unable to sustain life , and the Autobots , desperate to ensure the continued existence of the Transformer race , seek to flee the planet . The Decepticons , still bent on domination , will stop at nothing to ensure that the Autobots either submit to the Decepticons or are eliminated . Fall of Cybertron depicts the final battle between the two robot factions , which results in the desolation of their home world , forcing the Autobots to seek refuge in our galaxy , the Milky Way . The developer , High Moon Studios , hoped to show a darker tone than the original game . Game Informer 's Matt Miller stated that the game " changes and improves upon so many of the fundamental ideas that the developer considers the game a natural successor rather than a true sequel . "

 The game begins on the Ark , the spacecraft the Autobots use to flee their dying homeworld of Cybertron . On their journey , the Decepticons attack . Optimus Prime engages Megatron directly on the outer surface of the Ark . Bumblebee scrambles to his aid and finds Optimus just as Megatron is about to deliver a fatal blow . He dives in front of the shot , taking the hit for Optimus . The game then flashes back to six days earlier . 
 The Autobots defend the docked Ark from Decepticon forces . Optimus realizes they have broken through Grimlock 's post after unsuccessfully trying to contact him . Optimus leaves to help Ironhide and his forces defend the Ark . Jazz and Cliffjumper are sent to investigate , and while eliminating enemy tanks , Optimus 's turret suddenly deactivates . As he leaves to repair it the room transforms around him , leading him to a brightly lit chamber where he activates the city @-@ sized Transformer Metroplex . The titan disables two Decepticon cannons but is shot point @-@ blank by a third . Starscream and the Combaticons capture Optimus soon after and bring him before Megatron . As Megatron prepares to execute Optimus , Metroplex arrives and pummels him into the ground . Having lost Megatron , Starscream claims leadership of the Decepticons and orders a retreat . 
 Meanwhile , Jazz and Cliffjumper arrive at the Sea of Rust to locate Grimlock and his Lightning Strike Coalition Force . They find an enormous tower in a lake of energon firing a bright beam into Cybertron 's orbit . They find Shockwave at the scene and discover it is a Space Bridge . Shockwave escapes the ensuing confrontation , and Cliffjumper becomes trapped , leaving Jazz to fight off the incoming Insecticons . Cliffjumper overloads the tower , and he and Jazz are saved from the Tower 's explosion by Sideswipe . They report back to Optimus . 
 Shortly after the Autobots salvage energon from the tower , Starscream and his Combaticons arrive to reclaim it . Onslaught , the Decepticon team 's leader , briefs them on a plan to ambush the Autobot transport carrying the energon . Combaticons Vortex , Blast Off and Brawl destroy the supports of a bridge the transport must cross . Meanwhile , Swindle engages Autobot ground forces and destroys the wheel struts underneath the transport . The transport transforms into flight mode and the Autobots engage the Decepticon team . Starscream orders the Combaticons to abort the mission , but they defy him and combine to form Bruticus , who brings the transport down , inadvertently losing half the energon in the crash . Starscream arrives at the crash site and arrests the Combaticons for insubordination . 
 Elsewhere , Soundwave assembles a newer , more powerful chassis for Megatron . He awakens , frees the Combaticons , stops Starscream 's coronation as King of the Decepticons and reclaims leadership of the Decepticons . He then leads a full @-@ scale assault on the Autobot stronghold of Iacon , where the massive Decepticon Trypticon 's remains are kept . Megatron invades the facility and takes Trypticon 's power core , the heart of a transformer . He informs Trypticon that he is not being rescued as he " failed " him , but he congratulates him for destroying Iacon City and few more Autobots . Trypticon is then transformed into the Nemesis , the Decepticon flagship . 
 Starscream , having been humiliated at the hands of Megatron , infiltrates Shockwave 's base , where he finds Grimlock being held prisoner . He offers Grimlock freedom in exchange for his fealty , but Grimlock escapes by throwing Starscream into the restraint controls . He reunites with his teammates Swoop , Slug , and <unk> and defeats the defending Insecticons . Grimlock learns from Shockwave that their processors were tampered with , leaving Grimlock with a speech impairment . By way of his Space Bridge , Shockwave also found a new planet inhabited by large creatures ; these were used to inspire all of their new alternate forms . Grimlock was further modified , and now cannot transform on command , but must be in a state of rage to do so . Grimlock recalls a name that <unk> gave them , the Dinobots , and claims it as their new team name . Grimlock then notices another Space Bridge tower that Shockwave has constructed nearby . Grimlock fights his way to Shockwave , knocking him from the tower and destroying it . The crumbling tower falls , and the portal in Cybertron 's orbit begins to decay . 
 Before the launch , Metroplex sacrifices himself by transferring all of his energon to the Ark . Optimus then calls for the launch of the Ark to try and escape through the portal before it closes , but Decepticons arrive in the Nemesis to stop them . Soundwave leads the first wave of troops onto the ship through giant cables and destroys the Ark 's automated defense system . Jetfire is then launched into space to disengage the cables . Bruticus launches from the Nemesis and destroys the Ark 's fuel line before being blasted off the ship into empty space by Jazz and Jetfire . Nearby , Megatron and Optimus engage in battle . Before a winner can be declared , Optimus and Megatron are pulled off of the hull of the Ark and into the portal with both ships . The portal finally closes , leaving their home planet alone and quiet .

 Some characters who previously appeared in War for Cybertron feature updated appearances and transformation schemes , or moving parts that animate regardless of player action , similar to breathing . The character Optimus Prime was redesigned for a " more warrior @-@ type feel " , with more bulk added to his body mass . The weaponry in Fall of Cybertron was also modified and enhanced ; the designers of the game put out a call to everyone in the studio for new weapon ideas . Matt Tieger of High Moon explained that in addition to new designs , each weapon could be upgraded , continuing , " We really made a conscious choice to make every upgrade a significant improvement , so one upgrade might increase your firing speed by 75 % . We could have made the system so that there were a lot of upgrades that each improved your guns a little bit , but we wanted to make each upgrade feel like this giant thing . That way when players buy it they ’ re really going to feel the difference . "

The remixed version , called the " Power Mix " , was based on the melancholy " Sam 's Theme " version of the song , which was created for possible inclusion in the live @-@ action film Revenge of the Fallen . The credits begin with the " Power Mix " version , and segue into the 2007 version . Bush later released the " Power Mix " on iTunes the following September .

 Fall of Cybertron has received generally positive reviews . The PlayStation 3 version received an aggregate score of 77 / 100 at Metacritic , while the Xbox 360 and Windows versions both hold scores of 79 / 100 . GameRankings reports similar scores ; the Xbox 360 version has an aggregate score of 81 @.@ 40 % , the PlayStation 3 a score of 76 @.@ 48 % , and the Windows version a score of 79 @.@ 17 % Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb gave the game a 60 % approval , the lowest score reported . 
 Alec Meer of Eurogamer praised the developer 's focus on staying true to the Transformers source material : " Fall of Cybertron is a love @-@ letter to a fictional universe created in 1984 that has ... continued to this day . " Matt Miller of Game Informer agreed , calling the narrative " tightly crafted " . G4TV 's Matt Keil lauded the story , character development and voice acting . He called the game " a cinematic shooter that stands on the strength of its design and gameplay " . GameSpot 's Kevin VanOrd stated that while the game 's levels focused on flight are enjoyable and that some levels give players a sense of power , the campaign mode was " too often more exciting to watch than to play " . Corey Cohen of Official Xbox Magazine gave high marks for the variety of characters players control during the campaign . He noted that each felt unique from the others , but thought that the game could have utilized the gargantuan transformer Metroplex more . Miller cited that the variety of playable Transformers and their unique abilities kept the game interesting , adding that the control scheme suited each unique character well . 
 In a more critical review , Giant Bomb 's Jeff Gerstmann felt that the game had uneven pacing and gameplay . " The highs in Transformers : Fall of Cybertron are very high [ ... ] but it doesn 't go far enough in that direction to stand out " he stated . Gerstmann disliked the frame rate drops during heavy action sequences . IGN 's Matt Cabral also noted this , but dismissed these moments as " occasional hiccups " . Cabral gave high marks for visual presentation , including the transformations each character used to change forms . Both Cabral and Keil criticized the lack of cooperative campaign gameplay , a feature available in the game 's predecessor , as a low point of Fall of Cybertron . 
 According to the NPD Group , the game sold well during the month of its release , placing seventh in sales despite only being available during the last ten days . Fall of Cybertron sold 105 @,@ 000 copies during its North America debut according to Game Informer .

 = Chen Liting = 
 Chen Liting ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Chén <unk> ; 20 October 1910 – 27 August 2013 ) was a Chinese playwright , drama and film director , screenwriter , and film theorist . He was one of the most prominent film directors and screenwriters in pre @-@ Communist China , together with Shi Dongshan , Cai Chusheng , and Zheng Junli . His most famous film was Women Side by Side ( 1949 ) . 
 Chen was abandoned as an infant , and then lost his both foster parents during early childhood . Before becoming a film director , Chen worked mainly in drama . His patriotic play Put Down Your Whip was highly influential and performed countless times during the Japanese invasion of China . During the war he also made a famous staging of the play Qu Yuan , and wrote one of the first Chinese books on film theory . 
 After the early 1950s , Chen 's attempts at filmmaking were repeatedly thwarted by the PRC government for political reasons . He worked as general manager of Tianma Film Studio before being imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution . After his rehabilitation at the end of the period , he spent three years on the historical film Da Feng Ge , but retired after that film was also cancelled due to politics . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born in Shanghai in 1910 , Chen Liting was abandoned as an infant and adopted by foster parents . However , he lost his adoptive father at the age of four , and three years later his adoptive mother also died . Chen was brought up by his uncle , the brother of his adoptive father . He attended a boarding school in Jiangyin at the age of 12 , and in 1924 entered <unk> Middle School in Shanghai . 
 As a high school student at <unk> , Chen was influenced by the post @-@ May Fourth surge of modern drama . In 1928 , he entered Daxia University ( a predecessor of East China Normal University ) in Shanghai , where he translated , directed , and acted in The Rising of the Moon , a play by the Irish dramatist Lady Gregory . It was the first Chinese production of the play . 
 = = Put Down Your Whip = = 
 After university , Chen worked as a primary school teacher in rural <unk> County outside of Shanghai . In late 1931 , he wrote the patriotic play Put Down Your Whip ( also translated as Lay Down Your Whip ) , inspired by <unk> , an earlier play by Tian Han . It became extremely influential and was staged countless times throughout China during the Anti @-@ Japanese War . The play was staged both by amateur performers as well as famous actors . The actress Wang Ying even performed an English version of the play in the White House for President Roosevelt and his wife . The future Madame Mao , then known as Li <unk> , was also among its many performers . The play has been described in Chinese media as a " spiritual atomic bomb " against the Japanese invaders . It also inspired famous paintings by artists Xu <unk> and Situ Qiao . 
 = = Sino @-@ Japanese War = = 
 Chen returned to Shanghai in 1932 , where he wrote film reviews and translated Soviet books on filmmaking into Chinese . After the Japanese invaded China in 1937 , Chen joined the resistance movement , serving as the leader of the fourth brigade of the Shanghai Salvation Drama Troupe , which performed numerous patriotic street plays including Put Down Your Whip . The troupe fled Shanghai before it fell to the Japanese , traveling and performing for the next three years under harsh conditions through central and southwest China . 
 In 1941 , Chen arrived in Chongqing , China 's wartime capital , where he joined the China Film Studio and the Central Cinematography Studio run by the Nationalist government . However , he mainly worked in theatre , directing plays written by Wu Zuguang , Xia Yan , and Chen Baichen . His most impressive wartime contribution was the staging of Qu Yuan , a famous 1942 play by Guo Moruo . In 1942 , he also published Rules of Cinema , which is considered the first comprehensive Chinese book on film theory . 
 = = Between WWII and 1949 = = 
 After the Japanese surrender in 1945 , Chen returned to Shanghai . He joined the China Film No. 2 Studio that was newly established by the Nationalist government . He wrote and directed the film Far Away Love , whose premiere in Shanghai 's <unk> Theatre on 18 January 1947 was considered a landmark event in postwar Chinese cinema . The film starred prominent actors and actresses such as Zhao Dan , Qin Yi , and Wu Yin , and the Ministry of Defence put uniformed soldiers under Chen 's command for the filming . It was the first in a series of controversial epics on the social turmoil caused by the war . In late 1947 , he made another film Rhapsody of Happiness , written by Chen Baichen . 
 After moving to the Kunlun Film Company , a new private studio , Chen directed Women Side by Side ( also translated as Three Women or Female Fighters ) in early 1949 . Chen and the famous playwright Tian Han cowrote the screenplay . The film is his most famous and it is considered his masterpiece . 
 = = People 's Republic of China = = 
 After the founding the People 's Republic of China in 1949 , Chen directed two more films : Inescapable ( 1950 ) and Work Is Beautiful ( 1951 ) . But he worked mostly in administrative positions , serving as a member of the National People 's Congress , and general manager of Tianma Film Studio from 1957 until 1966 . 
 In the 1950s Chen was appointed director for the upcoming film Li Shizhen . However , due to his insistence that the director , rather than government administrators , have artistic control , he was dismissed and the film was directed by his friend Shen Fu . 
 In the early 1960s , Chen spent three years preparing to make a film about the life of Lu Xun , starring Zhao Dan , Yu Lan , and Sun <unk> , but the film was cancelled by the Shanghai 's Communist Party Chief Ke <unk> for political reasons . 
 Like many other intellectuals , Chen was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution ( 1966 – 76 ) . After being rehabilitated at the end of the period , Chen returned to work for the Shanghai Film Studio , where he was responsible for artistic quality . He and Chen Baichen worked together for three years to make the historical film Da Feng Ge , based on the Han Dynasty palace intrigues of Empress Lü Zhi after the death of Emperor Gaozu . However , the film was again cancelled by high @-@ ranking politicians , as it was reminiscent of the political struggles after the death of Chairman Mao Zedong . Chen Baichen had a heart attack on hearing news of the cancellation , while Chen Liting , then almost 70 years old , retired from filmmaking . 
 In 2008 , Chen Liting 's biography by Xia Yu ( <unk> ) , titled Far Away Love after his film , was published by China Film Publishing House ( ISBN <unk> ) . He was awarded a prize by Chinese President Hu Jintao for making " exceptional contributions to the art of drama " . 
 On the morning of 27 August 2013 , Chen Liting died at <unk> Hospital in Shanghai at the age of 102 .

 Chen Liting married Mao <unk> ( <unk> ) during the Great Leap Forward . After nearly 40 years of marriage , she died on 18 September 1998 . The couple had one child , a daughter named Chen <unk> ( <unk> ) , who emigrated to the United States . 
 = Gorgeous ( Kanye West song ) = 
 " Gorgeous " is a song by American hip hop recording artist Kanye West from his fifth studio album , My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ( 2010 ) . The track features a hook provided by Kid Cudi , a recording artist formerly signed to West 's label GOOD Music , and a rap verse provided by the Wu @-@ Tang Clan member Raekwon . The song was written by West , Cudi , Raekwon , No I.D. , Mike Dean and Rhymefest , and was produced by West , No I.D. and Dean . It contains elements of The Turtles 's cover version of the song " You Showed Me " . " Gorgeous " received mostly positive reviews from music critics , who generally praised the intricacy of the production , the quality of the guest features and the rock music inspired aesthetic of the song . Several critics cited West 's verses as a highlight of the track , complimenting his lyricism and delivery . 
 Before its release , West premiered an a cappella version of the song in the form of a freestyle rap on Funkmaster Flex 's Hot 97 radio show . Despite not being released as a single , the song appeared on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart . Cudi and West performed the song live at SXSW , and West performed the track at the Lollapalooza musical festival . " Gorgeous " was also utilized in West 's short film Runaway . 
 = = Background = = 
 The majority of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was recorded in Oahu , Hawaii , including " Gorgeous " . Following several media controversies , West decided to record his next album in a reclusive manner only working with artists he considered himself familiar with . The song features rapper and occasional singer Kid Cudi , a performer West once described as his favorite artist . The two had previously collaborated on West 's fourth album 808s & Heartbreak , an album that served as a big influence on Cudi . As a friend of West , Cudi was invited to Hawaii to listen to recording sessions of the album . One day when Cudi was hanging around the studio , he overheard the composition of " Gorgeous " , which he was overwhelmed by . He asked immediately to be featured on the track . While a majority of the artists who worked on the album passed their time playing games of basketball , Cudi smoked marijuana and worked @-@ out on a treadmill in preparation of the recording of his lines . On the recording of the song , Cudi mused ; 
 “ Gorgeous was one of those records that , as soon as I heard the beat , I was like , ‘ Man , this is the one . This is that ' This Can ’ t Be Life ' Kanye beat . This is that classic ‘ [ Kan ] Ye beat . I want to be on this . ’ I came up to him , and I was like , ‘ Man , are you working on this record ? Are you working on this beat ? ’ He goes , ‘ Yeah … do you got an idea for it ? ’ I was like , ‘ Yeah , I might . I didn ’ t . I was lying like a motherfucker . I was like , ‘ Yeah , man , I want to get on this joint . ” 
 Cudi commented that the way the song was recorded was similar to the way prior collaborations between the two were recorded ; West will bounce ideas off of other writers and gauge their reaction before going forward with any of his own ideas . In an interview with MTV Cudi commented , " that 's always our collab formula , and that 's just how ' Gorgeous ' came about . He just kind of told me what he was trying to say , I threw out some words , we rearranged words , and we came out with a bunch of different options before we come up with the hook . " 
 It was announced that Raekwon of the Wu @-@ Tang Clan would also be featured on the song , who West had invited to Hawaii . Raekwon initially had no interest in working with West musically , and originally only went to Hawaii to share some insight with him . According to the rapper , a lot of artists in the music industry refuse to be honest and give genuine advice because they don 't want to help their competition , comparing the mentality to a group of crabs in a barrel . One of the reasons for Raekwon 's desire to give West advice was because the frontman of the Wu @-@ Tang Clan , RZA , spoke positively of West . RZA stated that West embodied the mentality of the Wu @-@ Tang Clan , and praised his skills as a producer . RZA was a part of the recording sessions for the album in Hawaii , and contributed to the production of songs " Dark Fantasy " and " So Appalled " . Eventually after being impressed by West himself , Raekwon decided to collaborate with West on several tracks , including " Gorgeous " . Raekwon described West as a hard worker , and stated that the " first thing I can tell you about Kanye West is that he 's a hard worker . When you look at him , you can tell that he still has that whole hip @-@ hop thing in his bones . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Gorgeous " is a bluesy , rock @-@ driven song that features West 's thoughts on social injustice . Other topics such as sexual exploitation and social disillusionment are expressed throughout the track . It contains elements of The Turtles 's cover version of the song " You Showed Me " , which is where the guitar riff is derived . The song opens with a melodic electric guitar chord , erupting into the hook provided by Cudi . The production style found within the song is noticeably more subdued than average West compositions , quietly playing <unk> the lush guitar playing . West muses about social issues and comments on his past critics , rapping at a modest pace over the guitar @-@ driven production . Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented on West 's lyrical presentation on the track and compared him to rapper Jay @-@ Z , writing " on ' Gorgeous ' he sneers at the competition , ' you blowing up ? / that ’ s good / fantastic ' , maybe the <unk> blow @-@ off since ' Jay @-@ Z ’ s You got a little dough ? That ’ s cool with me . ' " Sputnikmusic 's Channing Freeman felt that the song was " <unk> slow " and that it was " driven by piano chords and a questing electric guitar . " Dan Vidal of URB commented on the intricacy of the lyrics : 
 " On ' Gorgeous , ' he treats his distorted vocals as if they were another instrument to be blended seamlessly into the mix alongside the muted electric guitar @-@ riff . He spits : Penitentiary chances , the devil dances / and eventually answers to the call of autumn / all them <unk> ’ , for the love of <unk> ’ / get caught with 30 rocks , the cop look like Alec Baldwin . This track is an excellent microcosm of the album because it exemplifies the pinnacle of Ye ’ s visionary talent . ” 
 The line " choke a South Park writer with a <unk> " is a reference to the South Park episode " Fishsticks " which parodied West . While he enjoyed the episode , it reportedly hurt his feelings . MTV highlighted the full verse , which goes ; " but this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus / Ready for the world 's games / This is my Olympics / We make ' em say ' ho ' cause the game is so <unk> / Choke a ' South Park ' writer with a fish stick . " The line " What 's a black beetle anyway , a roach ? " is a reference to The Beatles .

 The song attracted widespread praise by music critics , many of whom ranked it among West 's best songs . Pitchfork Media 's Ryan Dombal compared elements of the song to the rock band The Strokes , and stated that it contained some of the best lyrics ever written by West . Dan Vidal of URB largely praised the track , writing that it was an excellent song overall , though wrote that " in my personal opinion , I don ’ t really think Kid Cudi can sing ; and I ’ m not sure why his generally off @-@ key <unk> is appealing to people , but here it ’ s hypnotically on point – matching perfectly with the track ’ s imposing tone . " MTV wrote that the song featured West at his most boastful lyrically , musing that " while his lyrics are razor sharp , the production here is softer , resulting in a melodic finger wag to his naysayers rather than searing jabs . " David Amidon of PopMatters praised the performance by West on the song but felt that neither guest appearance ultimately left much of an impression . On the other hand , Sputnikmusic 's Channing Freeman felt that both Cudi and Raekwon fit perfectly on the guitar @-@ driven track . 
 Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield wrote " nobody else is making music this daring and weird " and described the song as " spooky space funk " . The Washington Post 's Chris Richards stated " West 's moment of post @-@ Beatles anxiety comes during ' Gorgeous , ' a song that moans and groans with a dark urgency that permeates this album . " Entertainment Weekly 's Simon Vozick @-@ Levinson described the song as " narcissistic " and noted West 's insults of his critics in the song . Alex Denney of NME praised West 's sense of humor on the song and praised the guitar work . Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine called West 's first verse on the song a " bilious rant about racial inequality " . AbsolutePunk 's Drew Beringer stated that West sounded angry on the song , and viewed that it contained some of his best lyrics . Andrew Barber of Complex stated that the track had several quotable lines , and commented that West was a " frontrunner " for hip @-@ hop 's best producers and rappers combinations . Barber called Cudi 's hook excellent , and mused that the " guitar riff on the beat will stay stuck in your head for days . " The song charted at 23 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart as reported by Billboard , however it only spent one week on the chart . The song also appeared on the South Korean Gaon Chart at 86 .

 = Hawaii hotspot = 
 The Hawaii hotspot is a volcanic hotspot located near the namesake Hawaiian Islands , in the northern Pacific Ocean . One of the most well @-@ known and heavily studied hotspots in the world , the Hawaii plume is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain , a chain of volcanoes over 5 @,@ 800 kilometres ( 3 @,@ 600 mi ) long . Four of these volcanoes are active , two are dormant , and more than 123 are extinct , many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls . The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaiʻi to the edge of the Aleutian Trench , near the eastern edge of Russia . While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries , the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries . The classic hotspot theory , first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson , proposes that a single , fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then , cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate , become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years . According to this theory , the nearly 60 ° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate . In 2003 , fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory , suggesting that hotspots are mobile , not fixed , and that the 47 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot 's motion rather than the plate 's . 
 Ancient Hawaiians were the first to recognize the increasing age and weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands . The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology , embodied in Pele , the deity of volcanoes . After the arrival of Europeans on the island , in 1880 – 1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot 's volcanics , confirming the relationship long observed by the natives . 1912 marked the founding of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar , initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands . In the 1970s , a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaii 's seafloor . 
 The hotspot has since been <unk> imaged , showing it to be 500 to 600 km ( 310 to 370 mi ) wide and up to 2 @,@ 000 km ( 1 @,@ 200 mi ) deep , and olivine and garnet @-@ based studies have shown its magma chamber is approximately 1 @,@ 500 ° C ( 2 @,@ 730 ° F ) . In its at least 85 million years of activity the hotspot has produced an estimated 750 @,@ 000 km3 ( 180 @,@ 000 cu mi ) of rock . The chain 's rate of drift has slowly increased over time , causing the amount of time each individual volcano is active to decrease , from 18 million years for the 76 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old Detroit Seamount , to just under 900 @,@ 000 for the one @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old Kohala ; on the other hand , eruptive volume has increased from 0 @.@ 01 km3 ( 0 @.@ 002 cu mi ) per year to about 0 @.@ 21 km3 ( 0 @.@ 050 cu mi ) . Overall , this has caused a trend towards more active but quickly @-@ silenced , closely spaced volcanoes — whereas volcanoes on the near side of the hotspot overlap each other ( forming such superstructures as Hawaiʻi island and the ancient Maui Nui ) , the oldest of the Emperor seamounts are spaced as far as 200 km ( 120 mi ) apart . 
 = = Theories = = 
 Tectonic plates generally focus deformation and volcanism at plate boundaries . However , the Hawaii hotspot is more than 3 @,@ 200 kilometers ( 1 @,@ 988 mi ) from the nearest plate boundary ; while studying it in 1963 , Canadian geophysicist J. Tuzo Wilson proposed the hotspot theory to explain these zones of volcanism so far from regular conditions , a theory that has since come into wide acceptance . 
 = = = Wilson 's stationary hotspot theory = = = 
 Wilson proposed that small , long lasting , exceptionally hot areas of magma exist under the Earth 's surface ; these heat centers create thermally active mantle plumes , which in turn sustain long @-@ lasting volcanic activity . This " mid @-@ plate " volcanism builds peaks that rise from relatively featureless sea floor , initially as seamounts as later as fully @-@ fledged volcanic islands . Plate tectonics cause the local tectonic plate ( in the case of the Hawaii hotspot , the Pacific Plate ) to slowly slide over the hotspot , carrying its volcanoes with it without affecting the plume . Over hundreds of thousands of years , the magma supply for the volcano is slowly cut off , eventually going extinct . No longer active enough to overpower erosion , the volcano slowly sinks beneath the waves , becoming a seamount once again . As the cycle continues , a new volcanic center manifests , and a volcanic island arises anew . The process continues until the mantle plume itself collapses . 
 This cycle of growth and dormancy strings together volcanoes over millions of years , leaving a trail of volcanic islands and seamounts across the ocean floor . According to Wilson 's theory , the Hawaiian volcanoes should be progressively older and increasingly eroded the further they are from the hotspot , and this is easily observable ; the oldest rock in the main Hawaiian islands , that of Kauaʻi , is about 5 @.@ 5 million years old and deeply eroded , while the rock on Hawaiʻi island is a comparatively young 0 @.@ 7 million years of age or less , with new lava constantly erupting at Kīlauea , the hotspot 's present center . Another consequence of his theory is that the chain 's length and orientation serves as a record direction and speed of the Pacific Plate 's movement . A major feature of the Hawaiian trail is a sudden 60 ° bend at a 40- to 50 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old section of its length , and according to Wilson 's theory , this is evidence of a major change in plate direction , one that would have initiated subduction along much of the Pacific Plate 's western boundary . This part of the theory has recently been challenged , and the bend might be attributed to the movement of the hotspot itself . 
 <unk> believe that hotspots originate at one of two major boundaries deep in the Earth , either a shallow interface in the lower mantle between an upper convecting layer and a lower non @-@ convecting layer , or a deeper D ' ' ( " D double @-@ prime " ) layer , approximately 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) thick and immediately above the core @-@ mantle boundary . A mantle plume would initiate at the interface when the warmer lower layer heats a portion of the cooler upper layer . This heated , buoyant , and less @-@ viscous portion of the upper layer would become less dense due to thermal expansion , and rise towards the surface as a Rayleigh @-@ Taylor instability . When the mantle plume reaches the base of the lithosphere , the plume heats it and produces melt . This magma then makes its way to the surface , where it is erupted as lava . 
 Arguments for the validity of the hotspot theory generally center on the steady age progression of the Hawaiian islands and nearby features : a similar bend in the trail of the Macdonald hotspot , the Austral – Marshall Islands seamount chain , located just south ; other Pacific hotspots following the same age @-@ progressed trend from southeast to northwest in fixed relative positions ; and <unk> studies of Hawaii which show increased temperatures at the core – mantle boundary , evidencing a mantle plume . 
 = = = Shallow hotspot theory = = = 
 Another hypothesis is that melting anomalies form simply as a result of lithospheric extension , which allows pre @-@ existing melt to rise to the surface . These melting anomalies are called " hotspots " in plume theory , but this name pre @-@ supposes the mantle source is unusually hot , a feature that has not been confirmed by observation . In the case of the Emperor @-@ Hawaiian seamount chain , the Pacific plate boundary system was very different at ~ 80 Ma , when the Emperor seamount chain began to form . There is evidence that the chain started on a spreading ridge ( the Pacific @-@ Kula Ridge ) that has now been subducted at the Aleutian trench . The locus of melt extraction migrated off the ridge and into the plate interior , leaving a trail of volcanism behind it . This migration may have occurred because this part of the plate was extending in order to accommodate intraplate stress . Thus , a long @-@ lived region of melt escape was sustained . Seismic tomography does not support the plume hypothesis . Notwithstanding the numerous papers that have been published citing seismological evidence for a plume in the region , these proposed plumes are all in different places , many of them tilting at high angles and in different directions , and some of them thousands of kilometers from the Big Island . No reliable image of a mantle plume extending down to the core – mantle boundary has been obtained . 
 = = = Moving hotspot theory = = = 
 The most heavily challenged element of Wilson 's theory is whether or not hotspots are indeed fixed relative to the overlying tectonic plates . Drill samples , collected by scientists as far back as 1963 , suggest that the hotspot may have drifted over time , at the relatively rapid pace of about 4 centimeters ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) per year during the late Cretaceous and early Paleogene eras ( 81 @-@ 47 Mya ) ; in comparison , the Mid @-@ Atlantic Ridge spreads at a rate of 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 0 in ) per year . In 1987 , a study published by Peter Molnar and Joann Stock found that the hotspot does move relative to the Atlantic Ocean ; however , they interpreted this as the result of the relative motions of the North American and Pacific plates rather than that of the hotspot itself . 
 In 2001 the Ocean Drilling Program ( since merged into the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program ) , an international research effort to study the world 's <unk> , funded a two @-@ month expedition aboard the research vessel <unk> Resolution to collect lava samples from four submerged Emperor seamounts . The project drilled Detroit , <unk> , and Koko seamounts , all of which are in the far northwest end of the chain , the oldest section . These lava samples were then tested in 2003 , suggested a mobile Hawaiian hotspot and a shift in its motion as the cause of the bend . Lead scientist John <unk> told National Geographic : 
 The Hawaii bend was used as a classic example of how a large plate can change motion quickly . You can find a diagram of the Hawaii – Emperor bend entered into just about every introductory geological textbook out there . It really is something that catches your eye . " 
 Despite the large shift , the change in direction was never recorded by magnetic declinations , fracture zone orientations or plate reconstructions ; nor could a continental collision have occurred fast enough to produce such a pronounced bend in the chain . To test whether or not the bend was a result of a change in direction of the Pacific Plate , scientists analyzed the lava samples ' geochemistry to determine where and when they formed . Age was determined by the radiometric dating of radioactive isotopes of potassium and argon . Researchers estimated that the volcanoes formed during a period 81 million to 45 million years ago . <unk> and his team determined where the volcanoes formed by analyzing the rock for the magnetic mineral magnetite . While hot lava from a volcanic eruption cools , tiny grains within the magnetite align with the Earth 's magnetic field , and lock in place once the rock solidifies . Researchers were able to verify the latitudes at which the volcanoes formed by measuring the grains ' orientation within the magnetite . <unk> concluded that the Hawaiian hotspot had drifted southward sometime in its history , and that , 47 million years ago , the hotspot 's southward motion greatly slowed , perhaps even stopping entirely .

 The possibility that the Hawaiian islands became older as one moved to the northwest was suspected by ancient Hawaiians long before Europeans arrived . During their voyages , seafaring Hawaiians noticed differences in erosion , soil formation , and vegetation , allowing them to deduce that the islands to the northwest ( <unk> and Kauaʻi ) were older than those to the southeast ( Maui and Hawaii ) . The idea was handed down the generations through the legend of Pele , the fiery Hawaiian Goddess of Volcanoes . 
 Pele was born to the female spirit Haumea , or Hina , who , like all Hawaiian gods and goddesses , descended from the supreme beings , Papa , or Earth Mother , and <unk> , or Sky Father . According to the myth , Pele originally lived on Kauai , when her older sister Nāmaka , the Goddess of the Sea , attacked her for seducing her husband . Pele fled southeast to the island of Oahu . When forced by Nāmaka to flee again , Pele moved southeast to Maui and finally to Hawaii , where she still lives in the Halemaumau Crater at the summit of Kīlauea . There she was safe , because the slopes of the volcano are so high that even Nāmaka 's mighty waves could not reach her . Pele 's mythical flight , which alludes to an eternal struggle between volcanic islands and ocean waves , is consistent with geologic evidence about the ages of the islands decreasing to the southeast . 
 = = = Modern studies = = = 
 Three of the earliest recorded observers of the volcanoes were the Scottish scientists Archibald Menzies in 1794 , James Macrae in 1825 , and David Douglas in 1834 . Just reaching the summits proved daunting : Menzies took three attempts to ascend Mauna Loa , and Douglas died on the slopes of Mauna Kea . The United States Exploring Expedition spent several months studying the islands in 1840 – 1841 . American geologist James Dwight Dana was on that expedition , as was Lieutenant Charles Wilkes , who spent most of the time leading a team of hundreds that hauled a pendulum to the summit of Mauna Loa to measure gravity . Dana stayed with missionary Titus Coan , who would provide decades of first @-@ hand observations . Dana published a short paper in 1852 . 
 Dana remained interested in the origin of the Hawaiian Islands , and directed a more in @-@ depth study in 1880 and 1881 . He confirmed that the islands ' age increased with their distance from the southeastern @-@ most island by observing differences in their degree of erosion . He also suggested that many other island chains in the Pacific showed a similar general increase in age from southeast to northwest . Dana concluded that the Hawaiian chain consisted of two volcanic strands , located along distinct but parallel curving pathways . He coined the terms " Loa " and " Kea " for the two prominent trends . The Kea trend includes the volcanoes of Kīlauea , Mauna Kea , Kohala , <unk> , and West Maui . The Loa trend includes <unk> , Mauna Loa , Hualālai , <unk> , Lānaʻi , and West <unk> . Dana proposed that the alignment of the Hawaiian Islands reflected localized volcanic activity along a major fissure zone . Dana 's " great fissure " theory served as the working hypothesis for subsequent studies until the mid @-@ 20th century . 
 Dana 's work was followed up by geologist C. E. Dutton 's 1884 expedition , who refined and expanded Dana 's ideas . Most notably , Dutton established that the island of Hawaii actually harbored five volcanoes , whereas Dana counted three . This is because Dana had originally regarded Kīlauea as a flank vent of Mauna Loa , and Kohala as part of Mauna Kea . Dutton also refined others of Dana 's observations , and is credited with the naming of ' a 'ā and pāhoehoe @-@ type lavas , although Dana had noted a distinction . Stimulated by Dutton 's expedition , Dana returned in 1887 , and published many accounts of his expedition in the American Journal of Science . In 1890 he published the most detailed manuscript of its day , and remained the definitive guide to Hawaiian volcanism for decades . 1909 saw the publication of two large volumes which extensively quoted from earlier works now out of circulation . 
 In 1912 geologist Thomas Jaggar founded the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory . The facility was taken over in 1919 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and in 1924 by the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) , which marked the start of continuous volcano observation on Hawaii island . The next century was a period of thorough investigation , marked by contributions from many top scientists . The first complete evolutionary model was first formulated in 1946 , by USGS geologist and hydrologist Harold T. Stearns . Since that time , advances have enabled the study of previously limited areas of observation ( e.g. improved rock dating methods and submarine volcanic stages ) . 
 In the 1970s , the Hawaiian seafloor was mapped using ship @-@ based sonar . Computed <unk> ( Synthetic Bathymetric Profiling System ) data filled holes between the ship @-@ based sonar bathymetric measurements . From 1994 to 1998 the Japan Agency for Marine @-@ Earth Science and Technology ( JAMSTEC ) mapped Hawaii in detail and studied its ocean floor , making it one of the world 's best @-@ studied marine features . The JAMSTEC project , a collaboration with USGS and other agencies , utilized manned submersibles , remotely operated underwater vehicles , dredge samples , and core samples . The Simrad <unk> multibeam side @-@ scanning sonar system collected bathymetry and <unk> data .

 The Hawaii hotspot has been imaged through seismic tomography , and is estimated to be 500 – 600 km ( 310 – 370 mi ) wide . Recent diffraction tomography and high @-@ resolution local tomography indicate a lower @-@ mantle mantle plume , and a pond of plume material is evidenced by a large low @-@ velocity zone in the upper mantle . These low seismic velocity zones often indicate hotter and more buoyant mantle material . A narrow low @-@ velocity column extending downward from 670 to 1 @,@ 500 km ( 420 to 930 mi ) under Hawaii connects with a large low @-@ velocity zone at 2 @,@ 000 km ( 1 @,@ 200 mi ) on the boundary between the core and mantle north of Hawaiʻi , showing that the plume is tilted to a certain degree , deflected toward the south by mantle flow . Uranium decay @-@ series <unk> data has shown that the actively flowing region of the melt zone is 220 ± 40 km ( 137 ± 25 mi ) km wide at its base and 280 ± 40 km ( 174 ± 25 mi ) at the upper mantle upwelling , consistent with tomographic measurements . 
 = = = Temperature = = = 
 Indirect studies found that the magma chamber is located about 90 – 100 kilometers ( 56 – 62 mi ) underground , which matches the estimated depth of the Cretaceous Period rock in the oceanic lithosphere ; this may indicate that the lithosphere acts as a lid on melting by arresting the magma 's ascent . The lava 's original temperature was found in two ways , by testing garnet 's melting point in lava and by adjusting the lava for olivine deterioration . Both USGS tests seem to confirm the temperature at about 1 @,@ 500 ° C ( 2 @,@ 730 ° F ) ; in comparison , the estimated temperature for mid @-@ ocean ridge basalt is about 1 @,@ 325 ° C ( 2 @,@ 417 ° F ) . 
 The surface heat flow anomaly around the Hawaiian Swell is only of the order of 10 mW / m2 , far less than the continental United States range of 25 to 150 mW / m2 . This is unexpected for the classic model of a hot , buoyant plume in the mantle . However , it has been shown that other plumes display highly variable surface heat fluxes and that this variability may be due to variable hydrothermal fluid flow in the Earth 's crust above the hotspots . This fluid flow <unk> removes heat from the crust , and the measured conductive heat flow is therefore lower than the true total surface heat flux . The low heat across the Hawaiian Swell indicates that it is not supported by a buoyant crust or upper lithosphere , but is rather propped up by the upwelling hot ( and therefore less @-@ dense ) mantle plume that causes the surface to rise through a mechanism known as " dynamic topography " . 
 = = = Movement = = = 
 Hawaiian volcanoes drift northwest from the hotspot at a rate of about 5 – 10 centimeters ( 2 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) a year . The hotspot has migrated south by about 800 kilometers ( 497 mi ) relative to the Emperor chain . <unk> studies support this conclusion based on changes in Earth 's magnetic field , a picture of which was engrained in the rocks at the time of their solidification , showing that these seamounts formed at higher latitudes than present @-@ day Hawaii . Prior to the bend , the hotspot migrated an estimated 7 centimeters ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) per year ; the rate of movement changed at the time of the bend to about 9 centimeters ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) per year . The Ocean Drilling Program provided most of the current knowledge about the drift . The 2001 expedition drilled six seamounts and tested the samples to determine their original latitude , and thus the characteristics and speed of the hotspot 's drift pattern in total . 
 Each successive volcano spends less time actively attached to the plume . The large difference between the youngest and oldest lavas between Emperor and Hawaiian volcanoes indicates that the hotspot 's velocity is increasing . For example , Kohala , the oldest volcano on Hawaii island , is one million years old and last erupted 120 @,@ 000 years ago , a period of just under 900 @,@ 000 years ; whereas one of the oldest , Detroit Seamount , experienced 18 million or more years of volcanic activity . 
 The oldest volcano in the chain , Meiji Seamount , perched on the edge of the Aleutian Trench , formed 85 million years ago . At its current velocity , the seamount will be destroyed within a few million years , as the Pacific Plate slides under the Eurasian Plate . It is unknown whether the seamount chain has been subducting under the Eurasian Plate , and whether the hotspot is older than Meiji Seamount , as any older seamounts have since been destroyed by the plate margin . It is also possible that a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate , explaining the hotspot chain 's bend ; the relationship between these features is still being investigated . 
 = = = Magma = = = 
 The composition of the volcanoes ' magma has changed significantly according to analysis of the strontium – niobium – palladium elemental ratios . The Emperor Seamounts were active for at least 46 million years , with the oldest lava dated to the Cretaceous Period , followed by another 39 million years of activity along the Hawaiian segment of the chain , totaling 85 million years . Data demonstrate vertical variability in the amount of strontium present in both the alkalic ( early stages ) and <unk> ( later stages ) lavas . The systematic increase slows drastically at the time of the bend . 
 Almost all magma created by the hotspot is igneous basalt ; the volcanoes are constructed almost entirely of this or the similar in composition but coarser @-@ grained gabbro and diabase . Other igneous rocks such as <unk> are present in small quantities ; these occur often on the older volcanoes , most prominently Detroit Seamount . Most eruptions are runny because basaltic magma is less viscous than magmas characteristic of more explosive eruptions such as the andesitic magmas that produce spectacular and dangerous eruptions around Pacific Basin margins . Volcanoes fall into several eruptive categories . Hawaiian volcanoes are called " Hawaiian @-@ type " . Hawaiian lava spills out of craters and forms long streams of glowing molten rock , flowing down the slope , covering acres of land and replacing ocean with new land . 
 = = = Eruption frequency and scale = = = 
 There is significant evidence that lava flow rates have been increasing . Over the last six million years they have been far higher than ever before , at over 0 @.@ 095 km3 ( 0 @.@ 023 cu mi ) per year . The average for the last million years is even higher , at about 0 @.@ 21 km3 ( 0 @.@ 050 cu mi ) . In comparison , the average production rate at a mid @-@ ocean ridge is about 0 @.@ 02 km3 ( 0 @.@ 0048 cu mi ) for every 1 @,@ 000 kilometers ( 621 mi ) of ridge . The rate along the Emperor seamount chain averaged about 0 @.@ 01 cubic kilometers ( 0 @.@ 0024 cu mi ) per year . The rate was almost zero for the initial five million or so years in the hotspot 's life . The average lava production rate along the Hawaiian chain has been greater , at 0 @.@ 017 km3 ( 0 @.@ 0041 cu mi ) per year . In total , the hotspot has produced an estimated 750 @,@ 000 cubic kilometers ( 180 @,@ 000 cu mi ) of lava , enough to cover California with a layer about 1 @.@ 5 kilometers ( 1 mi ) thick . 
 The distance between individual volcanoes has shrunk . Although volcanoes have been drifting north faster and spending less time active , the far greater modern eruptive volume of the hotspot has generated more closely spaced volcanoes , and many of them overlap , forming such superstructures as Hawaiʻi island and the ancient Maui Nui . Meanwhile , many of the volcanoes in the Emperor seamounts are separated by 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) or even as much as 200 kilometers ( 124 mi ) . 
 = = = Topography and geoid = = = 
 A detailed topographic analysis of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot as the center of a topographic high , and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot . The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain , falling with distance from the hotspot , particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones . The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain . Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time . 
 In 1953 , Robert S. Dietz and his colleagues first identified the swell behavior . It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling . Later work pointed to tectonic uplift , caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere . However , normal seismic activity beneath the swell , as well as lack of detected heat flow , caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause , in which the motion of the hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands . Understanding the Hawaiian swell has important implications for hotspot study , island formation , and inner Earth . 
 = = Volcanoes = = 
 Over its 85 million year history , the Hawaii hotspot has created at least 129 volcanoes , more than 123 of which are extinct volcanoes , seamounts , and atolls , four of which are active volcanoes , and two of which are dormant volcanoes . They can be organized into three general categories : the Hawaiian archipelago , which comprises most of the U.S. state of Hawaii and is the location of all modern volcanic activity ; the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands , which consist of coral atolls , extinct islands , and atoll islands ; and the Emperor Seamounts , all of which have since eroded and subsided to the sea and become seamounts and guyots ( flat @-@ topped seamounts ) . 
 = = = Volcanic characteristics = = = 
 Hawaiian volcanoes are characterized by frequent rift eruptions , their large size ( thousands of cubic kilometers in volume ) , and their rough , decentralized shape . Rift zones are a prominent feature on these volcanoes , and account for their seemingly random volcanic structure . The tallest mountain in the Hawaii chain , Mauna Kea , rises 4 @,@ 205 meters ( 13 @,@ 796 ft ) above mean sea level . Measured from its base on the seafloor , it is the world 's tallest mountain , at 10 @,@ 203 meters ( 33 @,@ 474 ft ) ; Mount Everest rises 8 @,@ 848 meters ( 29 @,@ 029 ft ) above sea level . Hawaii is surrounded by a myriad of seamounts ; however , they were found to be unconnected to the hotspot and its volcanism . Kīlauea has erupted continuously since 1983 through Puʻu ʻŌʻō , a minor volcanic cone , which has become an attraction for volcanologists and tourists alike . 
 = = = Landslides = = = 
 The Hawaiian islands are carpeted by a large number of landslides sourced from volcanic collapse . Bathymetric mapping has revealed at least 70 large landslides on the island flanks over 20 km ( 12 mi ) in length , and the longest are 200 km ( 120 mi ) long and over 5 @,@ 000 km3 ( 1 @,@ 200 cu mi ) in volume . These debris flows can be sorted into two broad categories : slumps , mass movement over slopes which slowly flatten their originators , and more catastrophic debris avalanches , which fragment volcanic slopes and scatter volcanic debris past their slopes . These slides have caused massive tsunamis and earthquakes , fractured volcanic massifs , and scattered debris hundreds of miles away from their source . 
 <unk> tend to be deeply rooted in their originators , moving rock up to 10 km ( 6 mi ) deep inside the volcano . Forced forward by the mass of newly ejected volcanic material , slumps may creep forward slowly , or surge forward in spasms that have caused the largest of Hawaii 's historical earthquakes , in 1868 and 1975 . Debris avalanches , meanwhile , are thinner and longer , and are defined by volcanic amphitheaters at their head and hummocky terrain at their base . Rapidly moving avalanches carried 10 km ( 6 mi ) blocks tens of kilometers away , disturbing the local water column and causing a tsunami . Evidence of these events exists in the form of marine deposits high on the slopes of many Hawaiian volcanoes , and has marred the slopes of several Emperor seamounts , such as <unk> Guyot and Detroit Seamount . 
 = = = Evolution and construction = = = 
 Hawaiian volcanoes follow a well @-@ established life cycle of growth and erosion . After a new volcano forms , its lava output gradually increases . Height and activity both peak when the volcano is around 500 @,@ 000 years old and then rapidly decline . Eventually it goes dormant , and eventually extinct . Erosion then weathers the volcano until it again becomes a seamount . 
 This life cycle consists of several stages . The first stage is the submarine preshield stage , currently represented solely by Lōʻihi Seamount . During this stage , the volcano builds height through increasingly frequent eruptions . The sea 's pressure prevents explosive eruptions . The cold water quickly solidifies the lava , producing the pillow lava that is typical of underwater volcanic activity . 
 As the seamount slowly grows , it goes through the shield stages . It forms many mature features , such as a caldera , while submerged . The summit eventually breaches the surface , and the lava and ocean water " battle " for control as the volcano enters the explosive subphase . This stage of development is exemplified by explosive steam vents . This stage produces mostly volcanic ash , a result of the waves dampening the lava . This conflict between lava and sea influences Hawaiian mythology . 
 The volcano enters the subaerial subphase once it is tall enough to escape the water . Now the volcano puts on 95 % of its above @-@ water height over roughly 500 @,@ 000 years . Thereafter eruptions become much less explosive . The lava released in this stage often includes both pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā , and the currently active Hawaiian volcanoes , Mauna Loa and Kīlauea , are in this phase . Hawaiian lava is often runny , blocky , slow , and relatively easy to predict ; the USGS tracks where it is most likely to run , and maintains a tourist site for viewing the lava . 
 After the subaerial phase the volcano enters a series of <unk> stages involving subsidence and erosion , becoming an atoll and eventually a seamount . Once the Pacific Plate moves it out of the 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) tropics , the reef mostly dies away , and the extinct volcano becomes one of an estimated 10 @,@ 000 barren seamounts worldwide . Every Emperor seamount is a dead volcano .

 " The Rapes of Graff " is the sixteenth episode of the second season of the American mystery television series Veronica Mars , and the thirty @-@ eighth episode overall . Written by John Enbom and directed by Michael Fields , the episode premiered on UPN on March 29 , 2006 . 
 The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars ( Kristen Bell ) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective . In this episode , while visiting Hearst College , Veronica runs into her old boyfriend , Troy ( Aaron Ashmore ) . He is subsequently charged with the brutal date rape of a student named Stacy ( Alia Shawkat ) . Meanwhile , Logan ( Jason Dohring ) deals with the aftermath of breaking up with Hannah ( Jessy Schram ) . 
 " The Rapes of Graff " features several notable guest appearances . Michael Cera and Alia Shawkat , two of the stars on Arrested Development , appear as two college students . Veronica Mars was previously referenced on that show , and the pair were scheduled for a guest appearance soon after Arrested Development was cancelled . In addition , Aaron Ashmore returns as Troy <unk> , a character who had not been seen since the fifth episode , " You Think You Know Somebody " . The episode received 2 @.@ 15 million viewers and was critically acclaimed , with praise focusing on the guest stars and the episode 's case @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week .

 In class , Veronica and the whole class are asked to participate in Woody Goodman 's ( Steve Guttenberg ) essay contest . Wallace ( Percy Daggs III ) invites Veronica to visit Hearst College . Logan abruptly breaks up with Hannah without giving an explanation , leaving her heartbroken . A student named Dean ( Michael Cera ) conducts Veronica and Wallace 's tour of Hearst , and the pair suddenly run into Troy . Veronica mocks Troy to his face , but he insists that he has changed his ways . At a party , one of the students hits on Veronica . The student gets more aggressive with Veronica , and when Troy begins to defend her , the student punches him . Later that night , Veronica sees Troy making out with Stacy ( Alia Shawkat ) . When Veronica is sleeping , Troy calls her unexpectedly , pleading for help , and Veronica visits him at the police station , where he has been charged in the date @-@ rape of Stacy . Meanwhile , Keith ( Enrico Colantoni ) comes to the aid of Cliff ( Daran Norris ) , from whom a briefcase of money was stolen . 
 Veronica recognizes " Daphne " , the perpetrator in Cliff 's case , as Madison Sinclair ( Amanda Noret ) . In order to prove his innocence to Veronica , Troy says that he left his name and number in Stacy 's room , arguing that a rapist would not have done such a thing . Veronica checks Stacy 's room and finds Troy 's name half @-@ erased . Stacy receives a box of someone else 's hair outside her door , and Veronica deduces that there have probably been other victims of the rapist , so she goes looking for someone who bought a wig recently , finding no one . Dean informs Veronica that the fraternity has a contest about how many girls they have had sex with , and the recruit with the lowest number of " points " is punished by being forced to shave his head . Veronica tracks down Stacy 's rape to someone named " Ice Man . " She barges into the fraternity 's basement , where she is stopped by two members . 
 Both fraternity members deny any involvement . Veronica finds another rape victim , and they both tell Stacy that Troy could not have been the rapist because he was on the other side of the country when the first girl was raped . Veronica discovers that the losing fraternity member sent the hair to Stacy , which was his own , because she made him lose the " contest . " Logan tells Hannah the truth about why they broke up , and it turns out that he only asked her out so that her father would drop the charges in the murder of Felix Toombs . Nevertheless , they reconcile , and Logan and Hannah are about to have sex before Dr. Griffith ( Rick Peters ) enters and takes her away . Wallace gets admitted into Hearst , and Hannah has been sent away to boarding school . Veronica learns that the Fitzpatricks could have framed Terrence Cook ( Jeffrey Sams ) for the bus crash .

 The episode was written by John Enbom and directed by Michael Fields , marking Enbom 's eighth writing credit and Fields 's fourth writing credit for the show . The episode 's title is a spoonerism of the title of the novel The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck . Phil Klemmer , another of the series ' writers , thought of the episode 's title . Both writers knew that this episode 's serial rapist case would later be used in the third season . The writers planned for one of Veronica 's classmates to be dating Don Lamb before they decided on Madison . The episode features guest appearances by Michael Cera and Alia Shawkat , then best known for their roles on Arrested Development as George Michael Bluth and Maeby Fünke , respectively . Their two characters had briefly mentioned the show in a season three episode titled " Family Ties " . The show had previously been alluded to on Arrested Development when some of George Michael 's dialogue is redacted and replaced by a subtitle that reads , " reference to off @-@ network high school private eye drama censored by Fox . " Series creator and executive producer Rob Thomas recalled contacting them soon after the show was cancelled and learning that Cera was a fan of the show : 
 Honestly , the day I heard they were shutting down production on that show , I called our casting director and said , ' Book them for " Veronica Mars " as soon as possible . ' I didn 't talk to Alia , but I talked to Michael and it turned out he 's a ' Veronica Mars ' fan and is excited to be doing it . So I 'm thrilled about that . 
 Both Cera and Shawkat requested that their roles not be similar to their characters on Arrested Development . Thomas reported their guest appearances to Chicago Tribune roughly two months before the episode aired . Cera was originally slated to return in season 3 , but due to scheduling conflicts , the role of Moe Flater was created instead . 
 The episode also features the return of Aaron Ashmore as Troy <unk> , a character who had not been seen since " You Think You Know Somebody " , an early season 1 episode . Ashmore enjoyed his reappearance on the show , stating in an interview that " It was kinda nice coming back and being the good guy and not the bad guy for once . " After the episode aired , Ashmore stated that " I think Veronica Mars is a great show , so if they wanted me to , I would love to [ bring back the character ] . I love the show , and I love the character of Troy , too . " However , the character would not return to the show after " The Rapes of Graff " .

The reviewer summed up by saying , " With all that going on , it could have been easy for this episode to fall apart somewhere ... " The Rapes of Graff " really managed to do everything it was trying to do quite well . It may have been missing something special to put it in the absolute top tier of Veronica Mars episodes , but it 's still a marvelous episode for pulling all those different strands together . Anais <unk> of BuzzFeed ranked the episode 27th of 64 episodes of Veronica Mars , but nevertheless gave a positive review , calling it " awesome " . She elaborated , " The banter is excellent , our main character shoots down every sexist on campus , and Michael Cera has a cameo .

 = Sticky bomb = 
 The Grenade , Hand , Anti @-@ Tank No. 74 , commonly known as the S.T. Grenade or sticky bomb , was a British hand grenade designed and produced during the Second World War . The grenade was one of a number of anti @-@ tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti @-@ tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation . Designed by a team from MIR ( c ) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae , the grenade consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives ( this added stability to the mix , as well as giving it its squash @-@ head @-@ like effect ) covered in a powerful adhesive , and surrounded by a sheet @-@ metal casing . When the user pulled a pin on the handle of the grenade , the casing would fall away and expose the sphere ; another pin would activate the firing mechanism , and the user would then attempt to attach the grenade to an enemy tank or other vehicle , ideally with enough force to break the glass ball . After it was attached , releasing the lever on the handle would activate a five @-@ second fuse , which would then detonate the nitroglycerin . 
 The grenade had several faults with its design . In tests , it failed to adhere to dusty or muddy tanks and , if the user was not careful after freeing the grenade from its casing , it could easily stick to his uniform . The Ordnance Board of the War Department did not approve the grenade for use by the British Army , but personal intervention by the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , led to the grenade going into production . Between 1940 and 1943 , approximately 2 @.@ 5 million were produced . It was primarily issued to the Home Guard , but was also used by British and Commonwealth forces in North Africa , accounting for six German tanks ; used by Allied Forces on the Anzio Beachhead , including the First Special Service Force ; as well as by Australian Army units during the New Guinea campaign . The French Resistance were also issued a quantity of the grenades . 
 = = Development = = 
 Since at least 1938 , Jefferis had been toying with the idea of a demolition or anti @-@ tank weapon that would be ideal for irregular warfare . It would work by having an explosive charge deform so that it has a substantial area of intimate contact with the surface of the target . Then , when detonated , the effect of the explosion would be focused on a small area and would rupture an armoured plate much thicker than would otherwise be the case . Sappers call such a device a " poultice " or " squash head " charge . Jefferis enlisted Drs Bauer and Schulman of the <unk> Science Department of Cambridge University , they had experimented with lengths of bicycle inner tube filled with plasticine to represent the explosive . These were fitted with wooden handles and dipped in rubber solution to make them sticky . In experiments , these prototypes proved difficult to aim and only by chance did any stick to the metal bins used to represent tanks . 
 With the end of the Battle of France and the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from the port of Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June 1940 , a German invasion of Great Britain seemed likely . However , the British Army was not well equipped to defend the country in such an event ; in the weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation it could only field twenty @-@ seven divisions . The Army was particularly short of anti @-@ tank guns , 840 of which had been left behind in France and only 167 were available in Britain ; ammunition was so scarce for the remaining guns that regulations forbade even a single round being used for training purposes . 
 Under the circumstances , Jefferis considered that his idea might have more general application for the British Army and the Home Guard . Jefferis was in charge of a department known as MIR ( c ) , which had been created to develop and deliver weapons for use by guerilla and resistance groups in Occupied Europe . MIR ( c ) was now charged with the development of the Sticky Bomb . 
 The problem of designing a sticky bomb had been delegated to the enthusiastic genius of Robert Stuart Macrae . Clearly , some sort of flexible bag was required to contain an explosive gel so that it did not matter how the bomb landed on the target . However , a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory . 
 Discussions of the problem in Macrae 's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood , a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer , but he was not directly working on the weapon . Norwood suggested that what was needed was a <unk> container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point : a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown , but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape . Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go . The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear , so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating . Having covered the bomb in glue , a non @-@ sticky handle was required ; in the handle , a delay fuse ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower 's hand ( just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade ) . 
 Meanwhile , finding a suitable adhesive was a significant problem . After unsuccessful experiments with a variety of candidates , somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck . <unk> performed better than anything previously tested , but it was still not good enough . Macrae 's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter ' K ' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer . Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd . The company 's Chief Chemist was soon working on the problem of a suitable adhesive and within a matter of weeks the problem was solved to Macrae 's satisfaction . 
 The filling for the bomb was developed by ICI . It was nitroglycerin @-@ based with a variety of additives to make it more stable and viscous . The glass flask containing the main charge held about 1 1 ⁄ 2 pounds ( 680 g ) of this explosive that was described as having the consistency of Vaseline . 
 The adhesive surface was protected by a light metal case which was released by pulling a safety pin : the case fell away as two hemispheres connected by a sprung hinge . The inside of the case was fitted with a number of rubber spikes that kept it clear of the glued surface of the grenade . Early models also had a strip of adhesive tape round the neck of the casing . 
 Development continued , but there were problems with service regulations that were not written with such an unconventional weapon in mind . The sticky bomb was inevitably rather fragile and even a specially designed box could not fully meet the army 's demanding requirements for withstanding rough handling without damage . It seemed there were problems at every turn . The Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , who was concerned with the state of the country 's anti @-@ tank defences , learnt about the grenade and urged its development . The Ordnance Board of the War Office did not approve the grenade to be used by the Army . However , Churchill ordered further tests to be conducted in July , and after personally viewing a demonstration of the grenade ordered that it immediately be put into production . His memo of October 1940 simply read " Sticky bomb . Make one million " . A couple of days later , Anthony Eden , then Secretary of State for War , added a scribbled note to a cabinet minute that recorded the order to go ahead with the bomb : 
 Anti @-@ Tank ( & indeed anti @-@ enemy generally ) bombs for Home Defence are vitally urgent and should be available in very large quantities . I don 't mind where they come from as long as we get them , home or abroad . [ emphasis as in original ] 
 In spite of top level pressure , the arguments rumbled on . Trials were disappointing , it was not possible to get the bomb to adhere to any surface that was wet or covered with even the thinnest film of dried mud " a customary condition of tanks " as Major @-@ General Ismay , on 27 June , could not resist pointing out . 
 Churchill was not amused : 
 General Ismay , I understand that the trials were not entirely successful and the bomb failed to stick on tanks which were covered in dust and mud . No doubt some more sticky mixture can be devised and Major Jefferis should persevere . Any chortling by officials who have been slothful in pushing this bomb , over the fact that at present it has not succeeded will be viewed with great disfavour by me . 
 Macrae , Ismay and Churchill all saw fit to record these arguments over the technical issue of stickiness . As Eden had pointed out , there was a lot at stake . The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke . What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate . The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available . 
 In his memoirs , Ismay recalled that he never solved the puzzle of how to convey his very genuine concerns of the time to the right people . A thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably stick to a vertical surface . However , the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto the top of a tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to twenty yards at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting . 
 Churchill considered any obstruction , however well @-@ meaning , as singularly lacking in imagination . In the event of invasion , he foresaw a desperate fight to the last and after the war , he wrote about how he envisaged the use of the sticky bomb : " We had the picture in mind that devoted soldiers or civilians would run close up to the tank and even thrust the bomb upon it , though its explosion cost them their lives . There were undoubtedly many who would have done it [ Italics added for emphasis ] . " He also later recorded how he intended to use the slogan : " You can always take one with you . " 
 Arguments rumbled on and there were endless delays . Early versions of the sticky bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport . There were understandable concerns over the explosive charge : pure nitroglycerin is notoriously susceptible to the slightest knock , but the mixture developed by ICI proved to be very safe even if it should get into the hinges of the storage boxes . By December 1940 , fewer than 66 @,@ 000 had been produced and the rate of production was disappointing at five to ten thousand per week . Further , it was suggested that the original order of one million be reduced to 200 @,@ 000 . Minor improvements to the design were made , of which the most significant was to replace the glass flask with plastic . Finally , after passing all the required tests , the sticky bomb – now the No 74 Grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board ; it was put into full @-@ scale production and it became a service issue . 
 On 14 May 1941 , Lieutenant @-@ General Sir Ian Jacob reflected : 
 The most extraordinary feature of the whole business , however , was the fact that the Secretary of State for War , in a Minute addressed to the Prime Minister on 25 November 1940 , said that the Director of Artillery and the Ordnance Board had only just been able to obtain from ICI the details of the explosive contained in the bomb . Seeing that the bomb was demonstrated in June 1940 , this statement can hardly hold water . The War Office seems to be to blame in that , up to the end of April , 1941 , no sticky bombs had been issued to any unit , nor had any dummies been provided for training . In view of our acute shortage of anti @-@ tank weapons , the whole story is discreditable . 
 Between 1940 and 1943 approximately 2 @.@ 5 million were produced . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Grenade , Hand , Anti @-@ Tank No. 74 consisted of a glass sphere in which was contained approximately 1 @.@ 25 pounds ( 0 @.@ 57 kg ) of semi @-@ liquid nitroglycerin devised by ICI . The sphere was covered in <unk> which was coated with a liberal amount of birdlime , an extremely adhesive substance from which the nickname ' sticky bomb ' was derived . A casing made out of thin sheet @-@ metal , and formed of two halves , was then placed around the sphere and held in place by a wooden handle , inside which was a five @-@ second fuse . The handle also contained two pins and a lever ; the first pin was pulled out to make the casing fall away , and the second to activate the firing mechanism in the grenade . This primed the grenade , with the lever being held down to ensure the fuse was not triggered ; then the user would run up to the tank and stick the grenade to its hull , using as much force as possible to break the sphere and spread the nitroglycerin onto the hull in a thick paste . Another alternative was for the user to throw it at the tank from a distance . Either way , the lever would be released and the fuse activated , and the grenade would then detonate . 
 The grenade did possess several problems with its design . Users were urged to actually run up to the tank and place it by hand , rather than throw it , thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process ; the user would then be placed in the unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever . It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable , which made it even more difficult to use . As the grenade was a short @-@ range weapon , users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them , and then to stick the grenade to the rear of the tank , where its armour was thinnest . Users were relatively safe from a few yards away , as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated . The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass , and a detonator instead of a cap . 
 = = Operational use = = 
 According to a War Office training pamphlet dated 29 August 1940 , the sticky bomb should be regarded as a portable demolition device which can be " quickly and easily applied " . It was reckoned to be effective against armour of up to one inch ( 25 mm ) thickness and was suitable for use against " baby " tanks , armoured cars and the vulnerable points on medium and heavy tanks . The safest and easiest application was simply to drop it from an upstairs window ; otherwise , it could be used in an ambush of mobile tanks moving along a narrow road or in an attack on tanks parked up for the night . The sticky bomb could be either thrown or slapped in place by hand , in the latter case , the advice was to use sufficient force to break the glass thereby creating a greater area of contact resulting in a more effective explosion . Finally , there was also the option of placing the bomb first and then pulling out the pin at a safe distance by means of a length of string . 
 Macrae credits the Australian army with developing the technique of slapping a sticky bomb directly onto a tank instead of throwing it from a relatively safe distance . Since the bomb used a blast effect , it was safe to do this and walk away provided only that the bomb 's handle was pointing away from the bomber – the handle would be shot away from the explosion " like a bullet . " Macrae gives no date for the development of this tactic . Macrae confirmed that placing the bomb rather than throwing it gives better adhesion and allows thicker plates to be penetrated . 
 The potential of the sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected , a good example being David Niven 's novel Go Slowly , Come Back Quickly . The unfortunate officer <unk> , while attempting to demolish a smelly privy , loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident . The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad 's Army . In the episode Fallen Idol Lance @-@ Corporal Jack Jones sticks his grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of the grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid . 
 However , the dangers inherent in the weapon were real enough , if the bomb became inadvertently stuck in mid @-@ throw , it could easily be pulled from a soldier 's hand triggering the firing mechanism and putting him in mortal danger . There were tragic accidents during training . 
 By July 1941 , 215 @,@ 000 sticky bombs had been produced . Of these , nearly 90 @,@ 000 had been sent abroad to North and South Africa , the Middle East and to Greece where it did useful service . The remainder were stored at Ordnance Depots or distributed to army and Home Guard units . There were many calls for the total production to be cut back and it is not clear how many were manufactured by the end of the war , but it was probably not much more than 250 @,@ 000 . 
 The grenade was first issued in 1940 to Home Guard units , who appeared to have taken a liking to it despite its flaws . Although the Ordnance Board had not approved the grenade to be used by Regular Army units , a quantity were provided for training purposes . However , a number of sticky bombs did find their way to British and Commonwealth units participating in the campaign in North Africa , and were used as anti @-@ tank weapons . During the Afrika Korps advance towards the town of <unk> in February 1943 , they accounted for six German tanks . They were also issued to units of the Australian Army , who used them during the Battle of Wau and the Battle of Milne Bay . They were used by various allied units on the Anzio Beachhead , namely the First Special Service Force , who obtained them from the British . A large number were also supplied to the French Resistance .

 In 1947 , the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors considered claims from Macrae and from the managing director of Kay Brothers . Macrae 's legal representative was Edward Terrell – himself a wartime inventor . At the time the crown opposed granting an award ; when Macrae was asked what elements of the sticky bomb he claimed to have invented , he replied " I am claiming no invention ; I merely claim the development of the bomb , which was my job . " However , in 1951 , the commission recommended that Macrae should receive an ex @-@ gratia payment of £ 500 [ about £ 14 @,@ 200 in 2016 ] and Norwood received £ 250 [ £ 7 @,@ 100 ] for his contribution .

 = Hurricane Jeanne ( 1980 ) = 
 Hurricane Jeanne was a moderate hurricane that formed and dissipated in the Gulf of Mexico without making landfall . The tenth tropical cyclone and eighth hurricane of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season , Jeanne developed over the southern Caribbean on November 7 . It moved swiftly northward , and it intensified to a tropical storm on November 9 . It entered the southern Gulf of Mexico on November 10 . Jeanne turned to the west on November 11 , and it rapidly intensified to its peak intensity of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . It weakened on November 12 , and its forward motion slowed ; the cyclone weakened further to a tropical storm because of dry air intrusion , and it executed a clockwise loop on November 15 . It dissipated on November 16 . 
 At the time , Jeanne was one of three November hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico ; it was the first tropical cyclone to attain hurricane strength in the Gulf of Mexico during November . The late season storm surprised maritime interests , and two barges broke free from towing vessels . Indirectly , the hurricane produced heavy precipitation that peaked at 23 @.@ 28 inches ( 591 mm ) in Key West . Minor beach erosion occurred along the Texas coast , where tides were two to four feet above normal ; coastal flooding affected the state , which was heavily impacted by tropical cyclones in August and September . Jeanne caused no deaths .

 On the late afternoon of November 7 , an area of disturbed weather organized to a tropical depression 60 miles ( 100 km ) east of <unk> Norte , Nicaragua . Its origins were traced to a tropical wave that originated over western Africa on October 26 . Atmospheric conditions resembled an early fall pattern , and a large ridge was situated over the Gulf of Mexico and Southwestern United States . The depression moved northward into the Caribbean Sea , and the environment supported further development . On November 9 , the depression strengthened to a 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) tropical storm and was given the name Jeanne . Later , an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft reported a strengthening system ; maximum sustained winds increased to 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , and a minimum pressure of 999 mbar was measured . The tropical cyclone moved northward into the southern Gulf of Mexico on November 10 . Jeanne 's northward movement was blocked by the ridge , and the cyclone slowly turned to the west . On November 11 , Jeanne quickly intensified to a minimal hurricane ; later , it attained its peak intensity of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . 
 On November 12 , Jeanne weakened to a Category 1 hurricane . It entered the western Gulf of Mexico , and its forward motion diminished as the ridge moved east . Later , Jeanne diminished to a 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) tropical storm . A developing trough remained west of Jeanne , and the cyclone was embedded in a weak pressure gradient . Although Jeanne briefly re @-@ intensified to 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , an advancing frontal boundary brought dry air over the western Gulf of Mexico . Jeanne weakened to a depression on November 14 . It executed a clockwise loop , and it merged with the frontal boundary on November 16 .

 Some residents on Dauphin Island voluntarily evacuated , spurred by memories of 1979 's Hurricane Frederic and Jeanne 's northward motion . 3 @,@ 000 workers evacuated their oil rigs because of Jeanne 's high waves . The National Hurricane Center advised small watercraft to remain in ports from Brownsville to Tarpon Springs . Forecasters expected tides of 2 feet above normal in Louisiana , which increased to 4 feet above normal along coastal Texas . In Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes , schools were closed because of uncertainties regarding Jeanne 's path . The hurricane center also expected Jeanne to make landfall in southwestern Louisiana , although the hurricane eventually stayed offshore ; thousands of residents moved inland , while Civil Defense officials remained alert . Forecasters expected locally heavy rainfall , although they suggested it would remain below 8 inches ( 203 mm ) . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The combination of a large high pressure system and Jeanne produced rough seas over the northern Gulf of Mexico ; wave heights reached 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 60 m ) . On November 11 , a ship reported sustained winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) , although this reading was discarded and attributed to intense squalls . In Key West , the storm 's outer fringes produced a record @-@ breaking 24 @-@ hour rainfall total of 23 @.@ 28 inches ( 591 mm ) ; 13 @.@ 58 inches ( 345 mm ) fell within six hours . It remains the record 24 @-@ hour November rainfall total for the city as of 2012 . The previous record was set in 1954 . The heavy precipitation was attributed to a mesoscale feature ; an inflow band intersected with an adjacent stationary front , which also contributed to the deluge . Schools and most businesses were closed , while flights were grounded at Key West International Airport ; authorities urged residents to stay home . Telephone and power services were cut to some areas of the city . 
 Elsewhere , several ships were caught off guard by the late arrival of Jeanne . The cyclone entered the Gulf of Mexico , and two barges broke loose from towing vessels via strong winds and high waves . One barge was an oil rig tender that contained 16 people ; it was carried several hundred miles across the central Gulf of Mexico . All crew members survived , and there were no maritime deaths related to the hurricane . Jeanne produced a prolonged period of rough surf and heavy swells along the Texas coast . Tides reached 2 to 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 20 m ) above normal . The hurricane caused coastal flooding ; the worst flooding occurred near Galveston . 
 Jeanne was one of only four tropical cyclones in the 20th century to attain hurricane status in the Gulf of Mexico without making landfall ; the others were Laurie of 1969 , Henri of 1979 , and Alberto of 1982 . 
 = Shikishima @-@ class battleship = 
 The Shikishima class ( <unk> , Shikishima @-@ gata senkan ) was a two @-@ ship class of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy in the late 1890s . As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself , they were designed and built in the UK . The ships participated in the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 1905 , including the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war . Hatsuse sank after striking two mines off Port Arthur in May 1904 . Shikishima fought in the Battles of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima and was lightly damaged in the latter action , although shells prematurely exploded in the barrels of her main guns in each battle . The ship was reclassified as a coast defence ship in 1921 and served as a training ship for the rest of her career . She was disarmed and hulked in 1923 and finally broken up for scrap in 1948 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Combat experience in the First Sino @-@ Japanese War convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy , and Japan embarked on a program to modernize and expand its fleet . As with the earlier Fuji @-@ class battleships , Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships , and turned again to the United Kingdom . They were ordered as part of the Ten Year Naval Expansion Programme and paid for from the £ 30 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 indemnity paid by China after losing the Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 1895 . 
 The design of the Shikishima class was a modified and improved version of the Majestic @-@ class battleships of the Royal Navy . They had the same armament and similar machinery as the Fuji class which was intended to allow them to work together as a homogenous group . The Shikishima @-@ class ships had an overall length of 412 feet ( 125 @.@ 6 m ) , a beam of 75 @.@ 5 – 76 @.@ 75 feet ( 23 @.@ 0 – 23 @.@ 4 m ) , and a normal draught of 26 @.@ 25 – 26 @.@ 5 feet ( 8 @.@ 0 – 8 @.@ 1 m ) . They displaced 14 @,@ 850 – 15 @,@ 000 long tons ( 15 @,@ 090 – 15 @,@ 240 t ) at normal load . The hull had a double bottom and was subdivided into 261 watertight compartments . The crew numbered about 741 officers and enlisted men , although this increased to 849 when serving as a flagship . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The ships were powered by two Humphrys Tennant vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one propeller , using steam generated by 25 Belleville boilers . The engines were rated at 14 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 800 kW ) , using forced draught , and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) although they proved to be faster during their sea trials . Shikishima reached a top speed of 19 @.@ 027 knots ( 35 @.@ 238 km / h ; 21 @.@ 896 mph ) using 14 @,@ 667 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 937 kW ) . The ships carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 643 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 617 long tons ) of coal which allowed them to steam for 5 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 300 km ; 5 @,@ 800 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main battery of the Shikishima class consisted of the same four Elswick Ordnance Company 40 @-@ calibre twelve @-@ inch guns as used in the Fuji class . They were mounted in twin @-@ gun barbettes fore and aft of the superstructure that had armoured hoods to protect the guns and were usually called gun turrets . The hydraulically powered mountings could be loaded at all angles of traverse while the guns were loaded at a fixed angle of + 13 @.@ 5 ° . They fired 850 @-@ pound ( 386 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 400 ft / s ( 730 m / s ) . 
 Secondary armament of the Shikishima class consisted of fourteen 40 @-@ calibre Type 41 six @-@ inch quick @-@ firing guns mounted in casemates . Eight of these guns were positioned on the main deck on the side of the ship 's hull and the other six guns were placed in the superstructure . They fired 100 @-@ pound ( 45 kg ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 300 ft / s ( 700 m / s ) . Protection against torpedo boat attacks was provided by twenty QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt guns and four 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns . The 12 @-@ pounders fired 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) , 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 359 ft / s ( 719 m / s ) . The ships were also equipped with four submerged 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes , two on each broadside . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The waterline main belt of the Shikishima @-@ class vessels consisted of Harvey armour 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) high , 3 feet 7 inches ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) of which was above the waterline at normal load , and had a maximum thickness of 9 inches ( 229 mm ) for the middle 220 feet ( 67 m ) of the ship . It was only 4 inches ( 102 mm ) inches thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six @-@ inch strake of armor that ran between the barbettes for 220 feet . The barbettes were 14 inches ( 356 mm ) thick , but reduced to 10 inches ( 254 mm ) at the level of the lower deck . The armour of the barbette hoods had a maximum thickness of 10 inches ( 254 mm ) while their roofs were three inches thick . Diagonal bulkheads 12 – 14 inches ( 305 – 356 mm ) thick connected the barbettes to the side armor , but the bulkheads were only six inches thick at the lower deck level . The casemates protecting the secondary armament were also six inches thick . The flat portion of the deck armour was 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick and four inches thick where it sloped down to the bottom of the armour belt . This significantly improved the ships ' protection as any shell that penetrated their vertical armour also had to penetrate the sloping deck before it could reach the machinery compartments or magazines . Outside the central armoured citadel , the sloped deck had a thickness of 2 inches ( 51 mm ) . The forward conning tower was protected by 14 inches of armour , but the aft conning tower only had three inches of armour .

 At the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , Hatsuse and Shikishima were assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet . They participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 when Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur . Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the Russian ships with his secondary guns . Splitting his fire proved to be a bad idea as the Japanese 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six @-@ inch guns inflicted very little damage on the Russian ships who concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect . Hatsuse was hit twice during the battle , 10 men being killed and 17 wounded , but Shikishima was only hit once with 17 men wounded . 
 Both ships participated in the action of 13 April when Tōgō successfully lured out two battleships of the Pacific Squadron . When the Russians spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division , they turned back for Port Arthur and the battleship Petropavlovsk struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night . It sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded . Emboldened by his success , Tōgō resumed long @-@ range bombardment missions , which prompted the Russians to lay more minefields . 
 On 14 May 1904 , Hatsuse , Shikishima , and the battleship Yashima , the protected cruiser Kasagi , and the dispatch boat Tatsuta put to sea to relieve the Japanese blockading force off Port Arthur . On the following morning , the squadron encountered a newly laid Russian minefield . Hatsuse struck one mine that disabled her steering and Yashima struck another when moving to assist Hatsuse . Hatsuse struck another mine while drifting about a half @-@ hour later that detonated one of her magazines and the ship sank in a little over a minute . The catastrophe claimed 496 crewmen although the escorting ships were able to rescue 336 men . 
 Shikishima was not hit during the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904 , although a shell exploded prematurely in one of her 12 @-@ inch guns , disabling it . During the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905 , she was hit nine times ; the most serious of which penetrated beneath a six @-@ inch gun , killing or wounding the entire gun crew . Again the ship had another 12 @-@ inch shell prematurely detonate in one of the forward guns , wrecking it completely . Shikishima was reclassified as a first @-@ class coast defence ship in September 1921 , and was used for training duties in various capacities until disarmed and reclassified as a transport in 1923 . Her hulk continued to be used as a training ship until she was scrapped in 1948 .

 " ' 522666 " is the fifth episode of the first season of the American crime @-@ thriller television series Millennium . It premiered on the Fox network on November 22 , 1996 . The episode was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong , and directed by David Nutter . " 522666 " featured guest appearances by Sam Anderson , Hiro Kanagawa and Joe Chrest . 
 Millennium Group consultant Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) is approached by the FBI when a series of bombs are detonated in Washington , DC . Black 's investigation soon reveals that the culprit seeks to be seen as a hero , setting off explosions in order to rescue people from the scenes ; leaving Black to track down the fame @-@ hungry bomber before more people are killed . 
 " 522666 " was one of many collaborations between Nutter , Morgan and Wong , with the three having worked together on several television series previously . The episode opens with a reference to existentialist philosopher Jean @-@ Paul Sartre , and featured Henriksen performing all of his own stunts . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Outside a bar in Washington DC , Raymond Dees ( Joe Chrest ) calls 911 on a payphone . He says nothing , simply typing the numbers 522666 on the phone 's keypad . Later , he watches the bar from a parking garage nearby , masturbating as the bomb he has left inside detonates . 
 Millennium Group consultant Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) watches the aftermath of the explosion on the news , knowing that the group will ask for his assistance with the case . Dees is among the rescuers seen on the broadcast . Black travels to DC and meets up with fellow group member Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) . The two join the FBI task force investigating the bombing , led by special agents Pierson ( Sam Anderson ) and Takahashi ( Hiro Kanagawa ) . Watts and Black quickly dismiss several false claims of responsibility by terrorist groups . Black listens to the 911 call left by Dees , deducing that the numbers dialled spell the word <unk> on a telephone keypad . 
 Black and the FBI investigate the crime scene ; Black not only realises the bomber 's proficiency with explosives , but is able to work out that he viewed the bombing from the parking garage . In a bin in the garage , they find a tissue covered in Dees ' semen . Black informs the FBI that the bomber is smart enough to be able to tap into their <unk> , and volunteers to bait him into eavesdropping on his mobile phone . Black 's deduction is correct , and as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call , he realises from Dees ' language that the bomber is seeking to become famous through his actions . Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning .
