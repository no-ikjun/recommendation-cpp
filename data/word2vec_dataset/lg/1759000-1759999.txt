 = M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage = 
 The M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage , also known as the M16 Half @-@ track , was an American self @-@ propelled anti @-@ aircraft weapon built during World War II . It was equipped with four 0 @.@ 5 inch ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) M2 Browning machine guns in a M45 Quadmount . 2700 were produced by White Motor Company from May 1943 to March 1944 , with 568 M13 <unk> and 109 T10 Half @-@ tracks being converted into M16s as well . 
 The chassis was derived from the T1E2 chassis , an earlier version of the M13 . Based on an M3 Half @-@ track chassis , it replaced the M13 MGMC half @-@ track after early 1944 . As aircraft became more advanced , the usefulness of the M16 was reduced . In the Korean War , it was relegated primarily to the ground @-@ support role , being put out of service in the U.S. Army in 1951 . 
 Nicknamed the " Meat Chopper " , the M16 was famous for downing low @-@ flying aircraft , making it extremely popular with soldiers . It was used by the United States Army , the British Commonwealth , and South Korea . A similar version of the M16 , the M17 , was based on the M5 Half @-@ track and exported via Lend @-@ Lease to the Soviet Union . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 The specifications of the M16 were similar to those of the M3 Half @-@ track . It was 21 ft 4 in ( 6 @.@ 5 m ) long ( with a wheelbase of 135 @.@ 5 in ( 3 @.@ 44 m ) ) , 7 ft 1 in ( 2 @.@ 16 m ) wide , and 7 ft 8 in ( 2 @.@ 34 m ) high and weighed 9 @.@ 9 short tons ( 9 t ) . It had suspension consisting of vertical volute spring suspension for the tracks and leaf springs for the wheels . 
 It was powered by a 128 horsepower ( 95 kW ) White 160AX 386 cubic inch ( 6 @,@ 300 cc ) 6 @-@ cylinder gasoline engine . It had a compression ratio of 6 @.@ 3 : 1 and a 60 US gallon ( 230 l ) fuel tank . It could reach a top speed of 41 @.@ 7 mph ( 67 @.@ 1 km / h ) and a range of 175 miles ( 282 km ) and a power to weight ratio of 15 @.@ 8 horsepower per tonne . It had a main armament of four 0 @.@ 5 in ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) machine guns in a M45 Quadmount and 12 millimeters of armor on the front and the sides . 
 = = Development = = 
 The M16 was an improvement on the twin .50 caliber M2 Browning heavy machine gun equipped M13 MGMC and M14 MGMC ( built on an M3 and M5 Half @-@ track chassis respectively ) . It was based on an earlier model of the M13 ( the T1E2 ) , but the M33 Maxson mount was replaced with the M45 Quadmount and the M2 Half @-@ track chassis was replaced by the M3 chassis . 
 This prototype was originally designated as the <unk> MGMC , but after trials at Aberdeen it was accepted as the M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage . A few corrections were made on a pilot vehicle in early 1943 ( including the addition of a gun shield ) before production started . 
 A total of 2 @,@ 877 were produced by the White Motor Company during the period from May 1943 to March 1944 , while 568 <unk> and 109 T10 Half @-@ tracks were also converted into M16s . Further production of the M13 and M14 was ceased in favor of production of the M16 and M17 ( an M16 built on a M5 Half @-@ track chassis ) . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The M16 Multiple Gun Carriage entered service in early 1944 , with the M13 taken out of action soon after . The M16 was nicknamed " The Meat Chopper " for its deadly firepower , and was extremely popular with troops . In addition to its anti @-@ aircraft role , the M16 was used in an infantry support role , frequently accompanied by the M15 Half @-@ track . The M17 MGMC primarily served with the Soviet Union as part of Operation Bagration and a few other battles . 
 The M16 saw service with U.S. forces in the Italian Campaign , and Operation Overlord , the Battle of <unk> , and the Ardennes Offensive in northern Europe . Small numbers were supplied to the United Kingdom and France under Lend @-@ Lease . The vehicle was also used widely in the Korean War by the South Korean army , the United States Marine Corps , and the U.S. Army . 
 As aircraft became more advanced over the M16 's lifetime , its role as a mobile anti @-@ aircraft weapon became limited . During the Korean War , it served mainly in the ground @-@ support role , at which it was highly effective . In late 1951 , it was declared as " limited standard " and largely taken out of service from the U.S. Army in Korea , although a few examples served until the end of the war . It was declared obsolete by the U.S. Army in 1958 .

 In his first full MLB season , Gilligan played for the Cleveland Blues .

" Over 52 games played , Gilligan batted a career @-@ low <unk> with 11 RBI and six doubles . Defensively , he played 27 games as catcher and 23 as an outfielder . Next season , Gilligan continued to play for the Blues , serving as backup catcher to Doc Kennedy before leaving the team at the end of the season to sign with the Providence Grays . With the Grays , he served again as a backup catcher before the starter ( Emil Gross ) became injured ; on the season , Gilligan batted .219 with 20 RBI . Next year , in 1882 , Gilligan became the starting catcher for the Grays ; his backup , Sandy Nava , was the first Mexican @-@ American baseball player . When the season was over , the Grays finished 52 – 32 , second in the National League ( NL ) , under manager Harry Wright . 
 By 1883 , Gilligan had become the Grays starting catcher .

 Blanton Long Collier ( July 2 , 1906 – March 22 , 1983 ) was an American football head coach who coached at the University of Kentucky between 1954 and 1961 and for the Cleveland Browns in the National Football League ( NFL ) between 1963 and 1970 . His 1964 Browns team won the NFL championship and remains the second most recent Cleveland professional sports team to win a title . 
 Collier grew up in Paris , Kentucky and attended Paris High School . After graduating from Georgetown College , he returned to his old high school to teach and coach sports for 16 years . Collier left the position to join the U.S. Navy in 1943 during World War II . At a naval base outside of Chicago he met Paul Brown , who was coaching a service football team there . After the war , Brown hired Collier as an assistant coach for the Browns , a team under formation in the All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) . After seven years as Brown 's top aide , a span over which the Cleveland team won five league championships , Collier took a job as head football coach at the University of Kentucky in 1954 . His Kentucky Wildcats teams amassed a 41 – 36 – 3 win @-@ loss @-@ tie record over eight seasons . 
 Collier was fired after the 1961 season and Brown re @-@ hired him as an assistant . Art Modell , the owner of the Browns , then fired Brown in 1963 and gave the head coaching job to Collier . Under Collier , the Browns reached the NFL championship game four times and won once , in 1964 . Struggling with hearing loss , Collier retired after the 1970 season , although he remained a scout and quarterbacks coach for several more years . He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1976 and retired to Texas , where he died in 1983 . Collier was well @-@ liked by players and renowned as a good sportsman and student of the game . The Kentucky chapter of the NFL Players Association in 2007 established the Blanton Collier Award in his honor . The Paris High School football field is named after him . 
 = = Early life and college career = = 
 Collier was born in Millersburg , Kentucky to O.H. and Eva ( née Long ) Collier . He attended Paris High School in Paris , Kentucky , where he played football and basketball . He worked as a tobacco @-@ picker in the summers during high school . After graduating , he enrolled at Kentucky 's Georgetown College , playing on the school 's football team and earning a bachelor of arts degree in 1927 . 
 = = High school and assistant coaching career = = 
 Collier went to work at Paris High School in 1928 as a mathematics teacher and coached several of the school 's sports teams . He got the nickname " George " when he was a teacher because he affectionately called most of his male students " George " and most of his female students " Martha " . He married Mary <unk> from Paris in 1930 and spent 16 years working at the high school before enlisting in the U.S. Navy in 1943 during World War II . Collier 's Paris football team had an overall win @-@ loss @-@ tie record of 73 – 50 – 10 . Collier was 37 years old when he joined the military ; although he likely could have avoided enlisting because he was a teacher and had a family , he felt serving in the war was his duty . 
 Collier was assigned to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside of Chicago , where he was a survival swimming instructor . It was in the Navy that Collier first had trouble with his hearing , a problem that dogged him later in life . He was once called to report to his ship over a loudspeaker but did not hear it . Doctors thought his hearing may have been damaged by teaching swimming in a tidal pool or from practicing on the shooting range . " It never became an issue until the Navy , when they figured he had less than 40 % of a normal person 's hearing , " his daughter Kay Collier @-@ <unk> said in 1997 . To compensate for his hearing loss , Collier became an expert lip @-@ reader . 
 At Great Lakes , Collier went regularly to observe the practices of the station 's service football team , the Great Lakes Bluejackets . There he met Paul Brown , who had left a head coaching job at Ohio State University to serve in the Navy and lead the Bluejackets team . Collier took notes and hoped to pick up some football knowledge he could use when he returned to Paris . Brown , however , noticed Collier 's dedication and brought him onto his staff as a volunteer assistant . 
 In 1945 , Brown was hired by Arthur B. McBride as the first coach of the Cleveland Browns , a team under formation in the new All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) . Brown hired Collier as a backfield coach for the team , which was set to begin play in 1946 . Initially his specialty was pass defense , but Brown soon rewarded Collier 's extensive football knowledge with a broader assistant coaching assignment . 
 Collier served under Brown from 1946 to 1953 , a period in which the team won all four titles in the AAFC before moving to the National Football League ( NFL ) in 1950 . That season the Browns captured the NFL title and then reached but lost the following three championship games . Collier 's coaching style was the opposite of Brown 's ; Brown was a disciplinarian whose stern nature and aloofness often brought him into conflict with players , while Collier was a friendly , warm man whose patience and <unk> endeared him to players . " Everything had to be perfect ; he was a stickler on perfection – but at the same time , he had great patience , " Browns quarterback Otto Graham said in 2007 . After the 1946 season , Brown asked Collier to analyze every play run by the offense , and Collier came up with a detailed breakdown of why each play succeeded or failed . This was the genesis of an annual grading system Collier developed to evaluate players ' performance . The Browns used it for many years . 
 = = University of Kentucky = = 
 When University of Kentucky head football coach Bear Bryant left for Texas A & M University after the 1953 season , Collier accepted an offer to succeed him . He stayed at Kentucky for eight years , a span during which the Wildcats football team had a 41 – 36 – 3 record , including a 5 – 2 – 1 record against arch @-@ rival Tennessee . Notable wins included a 1954 victory at Georgia Tech , then ranked 15th in the AP Poll , and defeats of eighth @-@ ranked Ole Miss in 1955 and 12th @-@ ranked Tennessee in 1957 . In 1954 , Collier was named the coach of the year in the Southeastern Conference . 
 Despite a winning record , Collier was fired in January 1962 , when he was making $ 17 @,@ 500 per year ( $ 136 @,@ 900 in 2016 dollars ) . He was replaced a week later by Charlie Bradshaw , an assistant to Bear Bryant at Alabama . Bryant had led the Wildcats to appearances in three major bowl games , but Collier never led the Wildcats to a bowl during his tenure . His best record was in his first year , when the team finished 7 – 2 . 
 Kentucky 's football program was overshadowed by its successful basketball program during Collier 's tenure . Collier was also criticized for his poor recruiting skills , a crucial factor for college coaches . Many fans wrote the university to complain about him and his staff . Still , several future star coaches served as assistants under Collier at Kentucky , including Don Shula , Chuck Knox , Howard Schnellenberger and Bill <unk> . Standout players under Collier included All @-@ Americans Lou Michaels and Schnellenberger . 
 = = Cleveland Browns = = 
 After losing his job at Kentucky , Collier said he was unsure what he would do next . " Right now I feel I would like to remain in football if the opportunity presents itself , " he said . Two weeks later , Brown brought him back onto the Cleveland Browns staff as an offensive assistant . Collier and Brown had remained close friends during his time at Kentucky . Collier attended the Browns ' training camps in Ohio during the summers , and Brown 's family visited Collier on occasion in Lexington . Collier said he was happy to be back with the Browns , saying it was " like returning home " . Brown praised Collier 's teaching and called him a " scientific football man " and " one of my closest friends " . 
 By the time Collier rejoined the Browns , the team was in the throes of a transition . Art Modell had bought the club in 1961 and was locked in a bitter power struggle with Brown . The two men came into conflict over Brown 's autocratic coaching style and his failure to notify Modell about personnel decisions . Without informing Modell , Brown in 1962 traded away star halfback Bobby Mitchell for the right to draft Ernie Davis , a back who won the Heisman Trophy and surpassed Jim Brown 's rushing records at Syracuse University . Davis died of leukemia before he played a down for the Browns . Brown 's relationship with Jim Brown , the team 's star fullback , was another source of tension between Modell and Paul Brown . Jim Brown grew increasingly independent as he rose to fame . He started a weekly radio show , which grated against Paul Brown 's emphasis on discipline and teamwork over individualism . Other players , including quarterback Milt Plum , openly questioned Paul Brown 's coaching and his control over the team 's play @-@ calling . 
 Brown made some changes as a result of the pressure from his players and Modell , and allowed Collier to put into place a " check off system " that allowed the quarterback to run several approved alternative plays to the ones Brown called . When Collier was praised in the Cleveland Press for instituting the system successfully , however , Brown put an end to it . " The players believed that Paul was upset when Blanton received some good press , " former Browns quarterback Jim <unk> said in 1997 . " Paul just junked Blanton 's system , as if to say , ' Hey , I 'm running the show now ' . " As Collier grew apart from Brown , he became closer to Modell , who enjoyed discussing football minutiae with him . 
 After a 7 – 6 – 1 season in 1962 , Modell fired Brown and offered the head coaching job to Collier . Collier told Modell he first needed the blessing of his wife and of Brown , to whom he still felt a sense of loyalty . He called Brown , who told him he had to take the job because he had a family to support . Collier accepted a three @-@ year contract that would pay him $ 35 @,@ 000 a year ( $ 270 @,@ 527 in 2016 dollars ) . In contrast with Brown , Collier was almost universally liked by players and other coaches . He was soft @-@ spoken , which was unusual for a head coach , but he earned the respect of the team with his extensive knowledge and his willingness to give players more freedom than Brown ever did . One significant difference was his approach to play @-@ calling . Like Brown , Collier served as his own play @-@ caller . However , he let Frank Ryan , who replaced Plum as the team 's starting quarterback in 1963 , change plays at the line of scrimmage and allowed more flexibility in pass routes and blocking schemes . 
 The changes paid off . In 1963 , the team finished 10 – 4 , and Jim Brown broke the NFL 's single @-@ season rushing record with 1 @,@ 863 yards . Brown was also voted the league 's Most Valuable Player . Cleveland , however , finished a game behind the New York Giants and did not reach the championship game . The Browns had started out 6 – 0 but faltered after racial divisions cropped up within the team . Some black players believed white teammates were getting to play ahead of them because of their race . Toward the end of the season , Collier met with the team 's leaders and told them the racism had to stop . After the season , he traded away players he thought were sowing discord and opened up a dialogue with those who remained to stamp out the tension . 
 = = = 1964 championship = = = 
 Cleveland climbed back to the top of the Eastern Conference in 1964 with a 10 – 3 – 1 record behind Jim Brown 's league @-@ leading 1 @,@ 446 yards of rushing and reached the championship game against the Baltimore Colts . Most sportswriters predicted an easy win for the Colts , who led the league in scoring behind quarterback Johnny Unitas and halfback Lenny Moore . The Browns ' defense , moreover , was suspect . The team gave up 20 more first downs than any other in the league . The teams , however , had not faced each other for three years . Before the game , Collier and Colts coach Don Shula agreed to give each other full access to video of regular @-@ season games . Ever the student , Collier took full advantage of the opportunity . The Browns had run what was dubbed a " rubber band " pass defense , allowing short throws while trying to prevent big plays . The Colts ' top receivers , however , Raymond Berry and Jimmy Orr , were not fast . They tended to pick apart defenses with short , tactical completions , which led Collier to institute a man @-@ to @-@ man pass defense for the game . This , he figured , would buy more time for the defensive line and force Unitas to scramble — not his forte . 
 The strategy worked , and in Cleveland Municipal Stadium two days after Christmas , the Browns beat the Colts 27 – 0 . The Browns scored 10 points in the third quarter and a further 17 in the fourth , clinching the team 's first title since Otto Graham 's departure after the 1955 season . 
 The Browns ended with an 11 – 3 record the following year and comfortably won the East for the second year in a row . That set up a second straight appearance in the NFL Championship game in Green Bay against the Packers . The teams battled it out on a slippery , mucky Lambeau Field on January 2 , 1966 . While score was close early on , Vince Lombardi 's team held the Browns scoreless in the second half , winning 23 – 12 in an upset on a Paul Hornung touchdown . Despite Jim Brown 's retirement after the 1965 season , the Browns had another four consecutive winning seasons and advanced to the NFL championship game in 1968 and 1969 under Collier , but lost both times . 
 Plagued by hearing problems , the 64 @-@ year @-@ old coach announced his retirement before the end of the 1970 season , which the Browns finished with a 7 – 7 record . Collier told Modell that he could no longer hear his players , and it was difficult to read their lips through new face masks that obscured their mouths . Modell tried to help by getting Collier to try new hearing aids and even sent him for acupuncture treatment , but none of it worked . Collier struggled during press conferences because he often could not hear what reporters were asking and answered the wrong questions . In eight years as coach , Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 76 – 34 – 2 record . Nick Skorich , who came to the Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964 , was named as his replacement in 1971 . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 Collier continued to work with the Browns after he stepped down , serving as a scout and quarterbacks coach until leaving the game for good in 1976 . He was the coach of the college team in the 1971 College All @-@ Star Game , a now @-@ defunct matchup between the NFL champion and a selection of the best college players from around the country , replacing former Browns quarterback Otto Graham . Georgetown College in 1970 awarded him an honorary doctorate of laws degree . 
 Collier was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1976 and retired to a house on a lake in Texas , where he played golf and visited with friends and family . He died of the disease in 1983 . His wife died in 1996 and was buried next to him in Paris , Kentucky . Collier and his wife had three daughters , Carolyn , Jane and Kay . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Collier was recognized after his death for his sportsmanship , intelligence and mild manners . He was inducted into the University of Kentucky College of Education hall of fame in 2001 . In 2007 , the Kentucky chapter of the NFL Players Association established a Blanton Collier Award given annually to a football player or players who excel both on and off the field . Past winners include Tony Dungy , Jim Brown , Gale Sayers and the Manning family : Archie , Olivia , Cooper , Peyton and Eli . A group of former Kentucky players in 2008 started the Blanton Collier Sportsmanship Group , which promotes ethics , education and integrity in sports . The non @-@ profit organization now oversees the Blanton Collier Award . The football stadium at Paris High School is named after Collier .

 = 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony = 
 The closing ceremony of the London 2012 Summer Olympics , also known as A Symphony of British Music , was held on 12 August in the Olympic Stadium . The closing ceremony was created by Kim Gavin , Es Devlin , Stephen Daldry , David Arnold and Mark Fisher . The worldwide broadcast began at 21 : 00 BST ( UTC + 1 ) and finished at 00 : 11 , lasting three hours and eleven minutes . 
 The stadium had been turned into a giant representation of the Union Flag , designed by Damien Hirst . Around 4 @,@ 100 people partook in the ceremony ; which reportedly cost £ 20 million . The 2012 Summer Olympics were officially closed by Jacques Rogge , who called London 's games " happy and glorious . " The ceremony included a handover to the next host city for the 2016 Summer Olympics , Rio de Janeiro and saw the Olympic flame extinguished and the Olympic flag lowered . The main part of the evening featured a one @-@ hour symphony of British Music as a number of British Pop acts appeared . Tributes to John Lennon and Freddie Mercury and the fashion industry were included in the section . Rio marked the handover with an eight @-@ minute section known as " Embrace " created by Cao Hamburger and Daniela Thomas , featuring Pelé . Sebastian Coe gave a speech , and the volunteers of London 2012 were thanked . 
 An average of 23 @.@ 2 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched the event , with an estimated 750 million worldwide . Critics were generally positive , but noted that it was not as good as the opening ceremony . Some of the foreign reviews questioned whether everyone would have understood the nods to British film and television . George Michael was roundly criticised for his song choice while Kate Moss , Naomi Campbell and Russell Brand were criticised for not demonstrating the Olympic ethos in their past behaviour . Some performers were initially reluctant to appear , and other high @-@ profile acts turned down invitations to perform at the ceremony . NBC in America and Prime TV in New Zealand were criticised by viewers for their broadcasts of the ceremony . There was also a concert in Hyde Park to close the Olympics , featuring Blur , New Order , and The Specials . 
 = = Production = = 
 The creative director and choreographer was Kim Gavin , with Es Devlin responsible for design and David Arnold as musical director . When Arnold was announced in his role he said that doing the closing ceremony was an honour and a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity . While Gavin stated that he was really excited and honoured to be involved . <unk> said that she was delighted to be part of the " greatest show on earth " . Hugh Robertson , Minister for Sport and the Olympics , stated that he was delighted to have a high @-@ quality team working on the ceremony . While Boris Johnson stated that we have the best of British creating the bookends to our Games . Stephen Daldry was the executive producer and Mark Fisher was in charge of production design . The ceremony cost £ 20 million , with the artists paid just £ 1 for contractual purposes . Around 4 @,@ 100 performers took part , comprising 3 @,@ 500 adult volunteers , 380 schoolchildren from the six original host boroughs , and 250 professionals . There had been around 15 rehearsals for the volunteers at the Three Mills Studio and at a full @-@ scale site in Dagenham , East London . 
 Gavin said that “ the show we are putting on is very shiny , it 's very colourful . We don 't want to bang on about our culture . We just want to have fun . ” Es Devlin added that it " has to make sense in Bognor and Bogotá . " She said that the creators had happily indulged in the chance to " visually draw on everything " that British imagination can offer . David Arnold said “ It 's going to be beautiful , cheeky , cheesy , camp , silly and thrilling " , and added that " we could have done this 15 times over , and not had the same show , and it would still have been full of amazing British music " . He thought that it should be the " greatest after party " and was “ really a celebration of Britishness in terms of [ all ] the arts " . Arnold himself had devoted two years working on the ceremony and had turned down all other work including Skyfall , but said that it was the " most fun " he had " ever had in music " . In the handover section Rio aimed to express " multicultural embrace . " Daniela Thomas stated that Rio " want to show you how sophisticated we mix things , what we do with the things you believe we are , how we mix with pop culture . " 
 The representation of the Union Flag used as an arena centrepiece was designed by Damien Hirst to celebrate the " anarchy and diversity of British pop art , and by extension the energy and multiplicity of contemporary British culture " . Hirst had been approached in November 2011 and agreed to do the design ; he called his artwork Beautiful Union Jack Celebratory Patriotic Olympic Explosion in an Electric Storm Painting . 176 photographs made up one centimetre of the stadium artwork with graphic designers having spent three months creating super @-@ high @-@ resolution images before printing . 
 Some performers had declined to perform , including The Rolling Stones , David Bowie , Sex Pistols , Kate Bush and The Libertines . According to industry insiders The Who apparently refused twice , and only agreed once they had announced a US tour . The Spice Girls were said to be reluctant to appear , feeling that the event was being staged at minimal cost , before their manager Simon Fuller persuaded them to perform . Noel Gallagher turned down the chance to perform after first being asked to play acoustically and then to mime to " Wonderwall " . 
 The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were not scheduled to attend as there is no formal role for the Head of State during the ceremony . The royal family was represented by Prince Harry , the Princess Royal and the Duchess of Cambridge .

 The ceremony began after a filmed countdown showing numbers from around London on such locations as road signs , 10 Downing Street and the Palace of Westminster clock tower , with a camera panning up the River Thames over Tower Bridge before turning left towards the stadium . The audience then completed a 10 @-@ second countdown to the start of the ceremony , to the chimes of Big Ben . The arena had been transformed into a huge representation of the Union Flag in black and white , with ramps and famous London landmarks such as the London Eye , Big Ben , Battersea Power Station and the Gherkin . Newspaper cutouts on both the set and road vehicles sought to show a " day in the life of London " , with words from British literary figures such as William Shakespeare , J. R. R. Tolkien and Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy . 
 Emeli Sandé appeared on a truck and sang a verse and the chorus of " Read All About It , Pt . III " . The Urban Voices Collective ( the choir for the ceremony ) sang The Beatles ' " Because " , which merged into cellist Julian Lloyd Webber ( sat upon the Royal Albert Hall ) playing Elgar 's Salut d 'amour , accompanied by Stomp performing on household items such as pots , pans and dustbins while suspended on the sculptures of the landmarks .

 At the same time , Winston Churchill ( Timothy Spall ) appeared at the top of Big Ben and reprised Caliban 's " Be not afeard " speech from The Tempest , first read by Kenneth Branagh in the opening ceremony . More paper @-@ covered motor vehicles entered . After Churchill finished his speech , people dressed in newspaper print began to fill the arena , ranging from office workers to school children . The beat of the music got faster and noisier , symbolising the London rush hour . As the noise reached a crescendo , Churchill cried out for all to stop , bringing this section to an end . 
 Prince Henry of Wales ( Prince Harry ) , representing the Queen , arrived with the President of the International Olympic Committee Jacques Rogge . The London Symphony Orchestra and the Urban Voice Choir performed the national anthem of the United Kingdom whilst the Union flag was raised by the armed forces and the performers waved mini Union flags in the stadium . Once the flag was raised Hirst 's artwork was revealed as the grey clouds were removed .

 This section started off with footage of Michael Caine in The Italian Job counting down from five , whereupon the Reliant Regal from Only Fools and Horses exploded with Del Boy and Rodney jumping out dressed as Batman and Robin . Caine 's words , You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off ! , echoed around the stadium . All the lorries had the newspaper removed and a colourful street party erupted , while Madness performed " Our House " . This was followed by the Massed Bands of the Household Division marching whilst playing Blur 's " Parklife " . Entering on rickshaws , the Pet Shop Boys performed their hit " West End Girls " , and then One Direction performed " What Makes You Beautiful " from the back of a lorry . Next there was another performance by Stomp .

 The centre of the arena was then cleared to reveal Britain 's Got Talent 2010 winners <unk> , who performed gymnastics to The Beatles " A Day in the Life " , were inspired by the idea of a commuter on the way to work , by forming a bed and a London Bus . Ray Davies of The Kinks arrived in a black cab and played " Waterloo Sunset " , as <unk> continued and local school children formed the Thames . The section closed with Sandé reprising " Read All About It ( Pt . III ) " as a montage of athletes crying in victory or defeat was shown on the screens .

 Greece led the Entrance of the Flags , as all 204 flags filed in to the strains of " Parade of the Athletes " ( composed by Arnold ) and marched up the central cross of the union flag , with Great Britain bringing up the rear . Meanwhile , volunteer marshals wearing blue suits and blue bowler hats with light bulbs on top marched into the stadium . The athletes then walked in from the several entrances , with some filtering down through the lower stands . As the same time Elbow performed " Open Arms " and " One Day Like This " . The volunteer marshals helped to usher the athletes into pens between the ramps of the arena . As the last athletes streamed into the stadium and the flags were moved by volunteers closer to the Olympic Flame , a reprise of some of the songs from the opening section was played . 
 = = = Here Comes the Sun ( 21 : 53 – 22 : 07 ) = = = 
 16 dhol drummers opened this segment as the performers entered carrying 303 white boxes to symbolise every event in the Olympic Games . The drumming merged into the newly recorded version of Kate Bush 's " Running Up That Hill ( A Deal With God ) " , as performers arranged the boxes to form a pyramid while video highlights from the previous 16 days of competition were shown on the screens . 
 This was followed by the victory ceremony for the Men 's Marathon , by tradition the final medal ceremony of the Games . Rogge and Lamine <unk> , president of the International Association of Athletics Federations , awarded the medals before the Ugandan national anthem was played . 
 Six athletes including Katherine Grainger and Katie Taylor presented flowers to six volunteers in a symbolic recognition of the 70 @,@ 000 volunteers ' contribution to the Games . This part of the ceremony was accompanied by The Beatles ' " Here Comes the Sun " .

 The section commenced with Queen 's " Bohemian Rhapsody " being played and a graphic equaliser being shown on the pixel screen . John Lennon then appeared on the big screens and was joined by Choirs of Liverpool in singing " Imagine " as a bust of Lennon 's face was created . Balloons were released at the end of this and George Michael followed singing " Freedom ! ' 90 " and " White Light " . A group of mods on scooters followed invading the arena ; one of them carried Ricky Wilson to the stage where his band the Kaiser Chiefs proceeded to cover The Who 's " Pinball Wizard " ; during the song the scooters continued to circle the arena . Several extracts of David Bowie songs followed , accompanied by images of Bowie ; this continued until eight billboards with artwork of models on arrived in the stadium , representing the British fashion industry . The artwork was dropped to reveal the models standing behind : Naomi Campbell ( wearing Alexander McQueen ) , Lily Cole ( wearing Erdem ) , Karen Elson ( wearing Burberry ) , Lily Donaldson ( wearing Vivienne Westwood ) , Jourdan Dunn ( wearing Jonathan Saunders ) , David Gandy ( wearing Paul Smith ) , Georgia May Jagger ( wearing Victoria Beckham ) , Kate Moss ( wearing Alexander McQueen ) and Stella Tennant ( wearing Christopher Kane ) . The models concluded the section by turning the struts of the Union Flag into a catwalk as they proceeded to the centre , walking to Bowie 's 1980 single " Fashion " . 
 A wooden boat was then carried in ; on board was Annie Lennox who proceeded to sing " Little Bird " . Ed Sheeran followed and was joined by Richard Jones of The Feeling , Nick Mason of Pink Floyd and Mike Rutherford of Genesis and Mike + The Mechanics , to cover the Floyd 's " Wish You Were Here " . Near the end of the song a performer appeared on a tightrope above the stadium , walked along it , and shook hands with a mannequin , which then burst into flames ( referencing the cover of Floyd 's 1975 album Wish You Were Here ) . A psychedelic bus then enters with Russell Brand sitting on top singing " Pure Imagination " from " Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory " then segues into " I Am the Walrus " ; before introducing Fatboy Slim , who played " Right Here Right Now " and " The <unk> <unk> " ; as the bus slowly transformed into a large inflatable Octopus . Three convertible Rolls @-@ Royce Phantom <unk> <unk> then arrived ; the roof of the first was taken down to reveal Jessie J who sang her hit " Price Tag " , as the cars did a lap of the stadium .

All three then left the cars to combine to cover the Bee Gees ' " You Should Be Dancing " . 
 A number of black cabs entered the stadium , five of which lit up with LED lights , each decorated with the Spice Girls ' individual trademark emblems , ( Posh : sparkling black , Sporty : go @-@ faster stripes , Scary : leopard print , Baby : pink and Ginger : The Union Flag ) . The Spice Girls emerged from the cabs and performed " Wannabe " and " Spice Up Your Life " . Halfway through their performance , they ascended onto the roofs of the cabs and proceeded to race around the stadium whilst singing and dancing from the roofs . Beady Eye followed by performing Oasis 's " Wonderwall " . " Mr. Blue Sky " by Electric Light Orchestra was played as a tribute to aviation was performed . Near the end of this song a human cannonball " died " and out rolled Eric Idle , who sang " Always Look on the Bright Side of Life " , accompanied variously by nuns on roller @-@ skates , Morris dancers ( Blackheath Morris and Rag Morris ) , Roman soldiers , Punjabi bhangra musicians dancers ( VP Bhangra ) , and bagpipes ( Reading Scottish Pipe Band , led by Pipe Major Ron Paterson ) before a human cannonball was fired across the arena . Muse then appeared and proceeded to sing the official song of London 2012 , " Survival " . In the darkness four trucks with screens on them entered and went to the centre of the stadium . Freddie Mercury then appeared on these and other screens around the stadium . Displayed was a vocal improvisation taken from Queen 's 1986 Wembley Stadium concert , before his bandmate Brian May performed part of the " Brighton Rock " guitar solo . May was then joined by Roger Taylor to re @-@ form Queen , as Jessie J , who wore a long yellow jacket in homage to Mercury accompanied the pair for " We Will Rock You . " More fireworks ended this section .

 The section began with the Greek national anthem being played and raising of the flag ; followed by the Olympic anthem and the lowering of the flag . The Mayor of London , Boris Johnson , then handed the Olympic Flag to Jacques Rogge , who in turn passed it to Eduardo Paes , the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro .

 Sebastian Coe and Jacques Rogge then appeared on a stage that was in the form of an arrow pointing towards Rio . Coe thanked all of the people who had helped make the Olympics happen . He said that the volunteers , who received another huge cheer , had the right to say " I made London , 2012 " . Coe thanked the country for getting behind the Games , and recalled his words from the Opening Ceremony " these will be a games for everyone " , concluding " these were a games by everyone . " He went on to thank the athletes and say that " the spirit of these Olympics will inspire a generation " , before concluding that " when our time came , Britain , we did it right ! " . 
 Rogge thanked Coe and his London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games team , saying that they had done a " superb job " . He said " we are indebted to so many tonight " , thanking the " wonderful volunteers , the much needed heroes of these Games " , as well as the British public and the athletes . Rogge said that the athletes had earned the right to be called ' Olympians ' due to the fair play and graciousness that they had shown , and he looked forward to the Paralympic Games . Rogge concluded by calling the Games " happy and glorious " , before proceeding to close the competition and calling upon the youth of the world to assemble in Rio in 2016 , ending with " Thank you , London !

 A total of 634 @,@ 500 individual LED pixels were used to create 27 images lasting 75 minutes .

 An estimated worldwide television audience of 750 million watched the event . Early data suggested that the British TV audience averaged 23 @.@ 2 million and hit a peak of 26 @.@ 2 million at 21 @.@ 35 . 
 The Daily Telegraph commented during the ceremony that , although fun , it lacked " top drawer " performers , and that Annie Lennox was " utterly underwhelming . " However One Direction , Jessie J , Tinie Tempah and Taio Cruz " shone " , while the Spice Girls " got the exuberant tone exactly right " . Tom Sutcliffe writing for The Independent said that it was " slick , impressive , often visually startling " and " eccentric , bewildering – and shameless good fun " . He added that " where Danny Boyle 's opening show had been a statement of intent and national values , this was an hour @-@ long advert for British stadium rock @-@ show design . " 
 The Guardian writer Michael Billington wrote that he was not sure how to review " a mix of pageant , pop @-@ concert , street @-@ party and presentation ceremony . " He added that it communicated the " energy of British popular culture over the past few decades and the gaiety of our Olympic ceremonies . " Billington praised Boyle , Devlin and Daldry , who had done a " tremendous job in lending what might have been orthodox Olympic rituals a blast of theatrical vitality . " While Alexis Petridis writing for the same paper said that the lack of a " gasp inducing moment " spoilt the show . Jan Moir of the Daily Mail queried whether the ceremony truly reflected Britain 's musical heritage and described the opening section as " dull , dull , dull " . She asked " how could anyone follow the Opening Ceremony for entertainment ? " , challenged " the logic " of clips of artists such as Bush and Bowie who had " declined to appear " , and said that the fashion section was " dreary " . 
 NZ Herald 's Troy <unk> @-@ Forbes wrote that there were " touches of brilliance , beauty , and bewilderment - often at the same time . " However he called Russell Brand " tuneless " , and during George Michael 's performance he thought that " if there had been remote controls here in the stadium , people might have been reaching for them . " His " undisputed champions " of the night were the Spice Girls and The Who . David Rooney of the Hollywood Reporter noted that the show " had something for every generation " and was an " all @-@ star ... crowd @-@ pleaser . " However he wonders whether non @-@ British viewers would have understood references to The Italian Job and Only Fools and Horses . Rooney concludes that the " Rio preview and the rousing Britpop marathon that preceded it were a reminder that the Olympics are as much about spectacle as sport . " 
 Gary Barlow was called " inspirational , brave and a consummate professional " after performing despite losing his fourth child on 4 August . However , George Michael attracted some criticism for singing his new song " White Light " at the ceremony . Critics saw this as shameless promotion . Michael replied that it was his one chance to thank his supporters , which he didn 't regret . It was his first appearance since almost dying from pneumonia and " White Light " was about that experience . Appearances by Russell Brand , Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss were also seen as controversial , as their previous behaviour had not always reflected Olympic ideals . 
 As with the opening ceremony , United States broadcaster NBC was criticised for its coverage , as omitting performers less @-@ known in the US . John Clarke , writing for Forbes , said it was wrong not to air performances from Ray Davies and Muse , as well as delaying the performance from The Who by an hour to broadcast the pilot of the sitcom Animal Practice followed by the late local news . While in New Zealand , Prime TV were also criticised for delayed coverage , running 20 minutes behind Sky Sport . In the Philippines , TV5 was also criticised because it only aired the first hour of coverage of the ceremony and highlights were incorporated into its morning news programme , Good Morning Club .

 = = Biography = = 
 Ernest Clayton Walker Jr. was born on August 19 , 1969 in Beaumont , Texas to Ernest and Danna Walker . The oldest of five children , Walker lived in Vidor with his father , who gave him a guitar when he was nine years old . Walker began entering talent competitions at age fifteen . After leaving his shift as nighttime desk clerk at a Super 8 Motel , he stopped at a local radio station to deliver a tape of a song that he had written . Although the morning disc jockey told him that the station 's policies prohibited playing self @-@ submitted tapes , he played Walker 's song and said that it was " too good to pass up . " 
 After graduating from Vidor High School in 1986 , Walker began working at a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant . At nineteen , he also began touring as a musician , playing various local clubs and eventually finding work as the house singer at a bar in Beaumont called the Neon Armadillo . In November 1992 , he was discovered by James Stroud , a record producer who was also the president of Warner Music Group subsidiary Giant Records . Walker signed to Giant late in the year . 
 = = Musical career = = 
 Walker released his self @-@ titled debut album in 1993 under Stroud 's production . Its first single was " What 's It to You ; " written by Robert Ellis Orrall and Curtis Wright , this song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks ( now Hot Country Songs ) charts and number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100 . Its followup " Live Until I Die " ( which Walker wrote ) , was released late in the year and became his second consecutive No. 1 in early 1994 . After those two singles came the number 11 " Where Do I Fit in the Picture " , which was originally the B @-@ side of " What 's It to You . " The album accounted for a third No. 1 hit in " Dreaming with My Eyes Open " , a song that was also featured on the soundtrack to the 1994 film The Thing Called Love . An additional cut from the album , " White Palace , " charted at number 67 on the country charts without being released as a single . 
 Clay Walker was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of one million copies . It peaked at number 8 on Top Country Albums , number 2 on Top Heatseekers and number 52 on the Billboard 200 . Larry Powell of Allmusic gave the album a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half star rating , saying that Walker had a " high @-@ energy " voice reminiscent of Conway Twitty . Walker also received two award nominations in 1994 : Star of Tomorrow award from TNN / Music City News and Top New Male Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music . 
 = = = 1994 – 96 : If I Could Make a Living and Hypnotize the Moon = = = 
 If I Could Make a Living was the title of Walker 's second album , released in 1994 . It produced two more No. 1 singles in the title track ( co @-@ written by Alan Jackson , Keith Stegall , and Roger Murrah ) and 1995 's " This Woman and This Man " . The latter song spent two weeks at No. 1 , becoming his first multi @-@ week No. 1 hit . Then came the number 16 " My Heart Will Never Know " . If I Could Make a Living went platinum in May 1995 , reaching number 2 on the country albums chart . Gordon Ely of the Richmond Times @-@ Dispatch gave a favorable review , saying that " Walker has broken loose from Nashville 's most recent crop of carefully crafted cowboys . " Walker also began touring in 1995 as a headlining act , in support of the album . 
 Late in 1995 , Walker released his third studio album , titled Hypnotize the Moon . Although none of its singles reached No. 1 , Hypnotize the Moon produced two consecutive number 2 hits in " Who Needs You Baby " ( which Walker co @-@ wrote ) and the title track , followed by the number 5 " Only on Days That End in ' Y ' " and the number 18 " Bury the Shovel " . Hypnotize the Moon was certified platinum in 1996 , making for Walker 's third consecutive platinum album . This album received a four @-@ star rating from Stephen Thomas Erlewine , who said that it was his " most assured , cohesive album to date " and that he gave a " consistently excellent performance . " Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly thought that Walker did not show a distinct musical personality , but considered the song selection strong and gave it a B + . Richard McVey II of Country Standard Time considered it a " throwback " in sound to Walker 's debut , while USA Today said that it lacked the " verve " of that album . 
 = = = 1996 – 97 : Rumor Has It = = = 
 Having just completed the tracks for his fourth album in 1996 , Walker was playing basketball with a friend , when he began to experience numbness , facial spasms , and double vision . Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that he had multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Walker subsequently began changing his diet and treating the disease with a daily injection of <unk> , sending his MS into an arrested state . 
 Also in early 1996 , Nu Millennia Media released Self Portrait , which included five of Walker 's songs in an interactive CD @-@ ROM format and 30 minutes of video footage . He then released his fourth album , 1997 's Rumor Has It , which he co @-@ produced with Stroud . Its title track , the first single , became his sixth and final No. 1 single that year . Other singles from the album included the number 18 " One , Two , I Love You " and the Top 5 hits " Watch This " and " Then What ? " at number 4 and number 2 , respectively . The latter also reached number 65 on the Hot 100 , making for his first entry on that chart since " What 's It to You . " As with his three previous studio albums , Rumor Has It was certified platinum . Larry Stephens of Country Standard Time gave this album a mostly @-@ negative review , calling the songs " cookie @-@ cutter " outside " I Need a Margarita " . Thom Owens of Allmusic also thought that it was formulaic , but said that Walker was " able to make even mediocre material sound good " , rating it three stars out of five . 
 = = = 1998 – 2000 : Greatest Hits and Live , Laugh , Love = = = 
 In April 1998 , Walker charted with a live rendition of Earl Thomas Conley 's 1983 single " Holding Her and Loving You " . This rendition spent nine weeks on the charts and peaked at number 68 . One month later , he debuted his sixteenth single , " Ordinary People " . Peaking at number 35 , it was one of two new songs included on his Greatest Hits album ; the other new track , " You 're Beginning to Get to Me " , made its debut in August 1998 and peaked at number 2 on the country chart and number 39 on the Hot 100 in January 1999 , the same month in which Greatest Hits was certified gold . Also in 1998 , Walker performed a sold @-@ out show at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo . 
 Doug Johnson , who succeeded Stroud as Giant Records ' president , produced Walker 's 1999 album Live , Laugh , Love . Regarding its production and promotion , the label 's senior director of marketing Connie Baer said that she wanted to raise Walker 's profile as an artist , as both she and Johnson thought that he did not have the same level of recognition as other artists with similar album sales and chart success . This album was led off by the number 16 country and number 74 pop hit " She 's Always Right " , which was co @-@ written by Lonestar 's lead singer Richie McDonald . After this song came the title track at number 11 country and number 65 pop . " The Chain of Love " , written by Rory Lee <unk> and Jonnie Barnett , was the album 's third and most successful single , reaching number 3 country and number 40 on the Hot 100 . Both it and " Once in a Lifetime Love " , the fourth single , first charted from unsolicited airplay received while " Live , Laugh , Love " was climbing the charts . " Once in a Lifetime Love " , upon its release , became his lowest @-@ peaking single release , reaching number 50 . The album also included a studio version of the Earl Thomas Conley cover . 
 Erlewine gave the album three stars on Allmusic , where he wrote that it " never really distinguishes itself from its predecessors " but " has its moments . " Brian Wahlert of Country Standard Time also thought that the album was inconsistent , saying that " She 's Always Right " , " The Chain of Love " , and the Conley cover were its strongest tracks , but that the rest " treads no new ground . " Deborah Evans Price of Billboard was more favorable , saying that it showed the energy of his live shows , and that he " cut loose " with soul singing on " This Time Love . " 
 In late 2000 , Walker recorded two tracks on Believe : A Christmas Collection , a multi @-@ artist Christmas music album released by Giant . These two tracks — a cover version of Elvis Presley 's " Blue Christmas " and the original song " Cowboy Christmas " — both made appearances on the country chart , reaching number 51 and number 70 , respectively . 
 = = = 2001 – 02 : Say No More and Christmas = = = 
 Walker released his twenty @-@ third single , " Say No More " , for Giant in early 2001 . It was the first single release from his sixth studio album of the same name , peaking at number 33 on the country chart ; the only other single , the Jerry Kilgore co @-@ write " If You Ever Feel Like Lovin ' Me Again " , reached number 27 . The latter song was promoted by Giant 's parent company , Warner Bros. Records Nashville , as Giant had closed in late 2001 . Walker co @-@ produced the album with veteran producers Byron Gallimore and Blake <unk> , and session guitarist Brent Mason . The album also included a song that Walker wrote in high school , and a cover of Ritchie Valens 's " La Bamba . " Maria <unk> <unk> of Allmusic rated it three stars , with her review saying that " the sensitivity on this album is so expressive that it makes you want to run right out and hug the one you love . " Country Standard Time critic Mike Clark considered it a transition to a more country pop @-@ oriented sound , describing the album as being " full of bad lyrics and overwrought production clichés . " 
 In 2002 , Walker wrote and recorded a song for the National Football League 's expansion team , the Houston Texans . Titled " Football Time in Houston , " the song was used as the team 's official fight song during its inaugural season . In an interview with CMT , he said that he donated the song to the city of Houston , and that he sings " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " at the team 's opening game every season . 
 Although he had left Warner Bros. for RCA Records ' Nashville division in May 2002 , Warner Bros. released a Christmas music album entitled Christmas in September of the same year . It included a cover of José Feliciano 's " Feliz Navidad " , which Walker took to number 49 on the country chart in January 2003 . 
 = = = 2003 – 04 : A Few Questions = = = 
 Walker 's first single release for RCA , " A Few Questions " , debuted in April 2003 . The song spent twenty @-@ seven weeks on the country charts and peaked at number 9 , making for his first top ten entry since " The Chain of Love " three years previous . This was the first single from his only RCA album , also titled A Few Questions , which he produced with Jimmy Ritchey . Its second single , " I Can 't Sleep , " also peaked at number 9 in early 2004 . This song featured backing vocals from Chely Wright , with whom Walker wrote it . The third and final single was the number 31 " Jesus Was a Country Boy " , which Walker wrote with Rivers Rutherford . A Few Questions accounted for his second @-@ highest peak on the country albums charts , reaching number 3 . 
 Erlewine rated this album two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five on Allmusic . He considered the album more country pop @-@ oriented than Walker 's work for Giant , saying that this change in sound made it not " feel like a Clay Walker album . " Dan McIntosh gave a mostly @-@ negative review for Country Standard Time , where he wrote that " even his passionate singing cannot rise above this album 's predictable lyrics and lame arrangements . " 
 = = = 2005 – 08 : Fall = = = 
 Walker was signed his third record deal in July 2005 , this time with the Asylum @-@ Curb division of Curb Records . His first single for the label , " ' Fore She Was Mama , " reached a peak of number 21 in March 2007 . It was included on his album Fall , which was produced by Keith Stegall . The album 's title cut , " Fall , " was written by Clay Mills along with former Mercury Records artist Shane Minor and former Exile member Sonny <unk> . It was the second single release from Fall , going to number 5 on the country charts and number 55 on the Hot 100 . The album 's third and final single was " She Likes It in the Morning " , with a number 43 country peak . Fall also included a duet with Freddy Fender , the first duet of Walker 's career , on a cover of Fender 's debut single " Before the Next Teardrop Falls . " Walker and Fender recorded this duet in early 2006 ; Fender died of lung cancer in October of the same year . 
 Erlewine gave a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half star rating , saying that Stegall 's production gave it a more traditional sound in comparison to A Few Questions , and that , despite having some " sappy " songs , it was his " most enjoyable collection in some time . " Engine 145 reviewer Brady <unk> rated it three stars out of five , praising Walker 's vocal performance but saying that the song selection " seemed to be lacking in everything but fluff . " Country Standard Time reviewer Jeffrey B. Remz wrote that Walker showed " a very pleasant country voice with a good sense of emotion " and that the production was more country @-@ sounding than most mainstream acts , but said that it had several " generic " songs . 
 = = = 2009 – present : She Won 't Be Lonely Long and Best Of Clay Walker = = = 
 Walker 's second album for Asylum @-@ Curb was first announced in June 2009 . Its first single , " She Won 't Be Lonely Long " , was given an official release date of December 2009 , although it had already entered the country charts in late November . In advance of his ninth album , Walker released an extended play titled She Won 't Be Lonely Long . The album , also titled She Won 't Be Lonely Long , was released on June 8 , 2010 . It includes a cover of Alabama 's 1980 single " Feels So Right " with a backing vocal from Alabama 's lead singer , Randy Owen . Allmusic reviewer Thom Jurek praised the album for its " straight @-@ up , mainstream contemporary country " sound but said that it did not reflect a change in sound from Fall . 
 " She Won 't Be Lonely Long " peaked at number 4 on the country chart in mid @-@ 2010 . The album 's second single , " Where Do I Go from You " , was released to radio on August 2 , 2010 , with " Like We Never Said Goodbye " following in late 2011 . The album 's fourth single , " Jesse James " was released in 2012 under Curb 's Sidewalk Records imprint . 
 The first compilation album for Asylum @-@ Curb titled Best Of Clay Walker was released in February 2014 . It contains 10 songs , 7 of them are new recordings of his greatest hits originally recorded for Giant label in the 1990s . No single was released from the album . 
 " Rock the Radio " will be Clay 's next release in 2015 . 
 On September 11 , 2015 , Clay released " Right Now , " a track presumably from his upcoming album . 
 = = Musical image and influences = = 
 In 1994 , Bob Cannon of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Walker 's image of a " <unk> hat , sturdy <unk> face , and very tight jeans " seemed to be from a " Country Music Handbook for Success , " but also said that he " ignores the danger of being dismissed as just another hunk in a hat . " Walker has been compared to Mark Chesnutt and Tracy Byrd , both of whom are also Beaumont , Texas natives who began their careers shortly before Walker did . Of the comparison among the three , Rick Koster wrote in the book Texas Music that Walker 's success came more quickly than that of Chesnutt or Byrd . Kurt Wolff and Orla Duane , authors of Country Music : The Rough Guide , said that he " had loads of youthful energy , a golden Texas twang , and , of course , plenty of boyish good looks . " They also called his music " relatively tame " but said that " his Texas bar @-@ room roots remain clearly visible in his voice and songs . " Regarding Walker 's onstage persona , former Warner Bros. executive Bill Mayne told Billboard magazine in 1997 that Walker has " maintained a low profile " but that he " really touches people and connects . " 
 Walker described his voice to CMT as " raspy [ and ] rugged . " He cites George Jones ( also a Beaumont native ) as a primary influence , as well as James Taylor and Bob Seger ; he has also said that , because he grew up in a largely African @-@ American neighborhood , his singing style was influenced by rhythm and blues music . In addition , he said that after his diagnosis , he realized that " you need to love your family " and said that , because he considered his songs positive in nature , he felt that he could connect to younger listeners . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Before the release of his first single , Walker married a rodeo queen named Lori Jayne Lampson . They had two daughters : <unk> <unk> , born on January 14 , 1996 , and <unk> <unk> , born on May 14 , 1999 . The couple divorced in 2003 . He married model Jessica Craig on September 28 , 2007 and had three more children with her : a son named William Clayton , born August 5 , 2008 , and a daughter named Mary Elizabeth , born December 27 , 2009 @.@ and son Elijah Craig born June ( Fathers Day 2013 ) 
 Walker has participated in several forms of charity to help raise awareness of Multiple Sclerosis following his diagnosis in 1996 , including his own non @-@ profit charity , Band Against MS , which he founded in 2003 . In 2008 , he received a Humanitarian Award for his charitable efforts in relations to MS and participated in a charity golf tournament benefiting his organization .

 = Bulgaria = 
 Bulgaria ( / <unk> , <unk> / ; Bulgarian : <unk> , tr . <unk> ) , officially the Republic of Bulgaria ( Bulgarian : <unk> <unk> , tr . Republika <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] ) , is a country in southeastern Europe . It is bordered by Romania to the north , Serbia and Macedonia to the west , Greece and Turkey to the south , and the Black Sea to the east . With a territory of 110 @,@ 994 square kilometres ( 42 @,@ 855 sq mi ) , Bulgaria is Europe 's 16th @-@ largest country . 
 Organised prehistoric cultures began developing on current Bulgarian lands during the Neolithic period . Its ancient history saw the presence of the Thracians , Greeks and Romans . The emergence of a unified Bulgarian state dates back to the establishment of the First Bulgarian Empire in 681 AD , which dominated most of the Balkans and functioned as a cultural hub for Slavs during the Middle Ages . With the downfall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in 1396 , its territories came under Ottoman rule for nearly five centuries . The Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 78 led to the formation of the Third Bulgarian State . The following years saw several conflicts with its neighbours , which prompted Bulgaria to align with Germany in both world wars . In 1946 it became a one @-@ party socialist state as part of the Soviet @-@ led Eastern Bloc . In December 1989 the ruling Communist Party allowed multi @-@ party elections , which subsequently led to Bulgaria 's transition into a democracy and a market @-@ based economy . 
 Bulgaria 's population of 7 @.@ 4 million people is predominantly urbanised and mainly concentrated in the administrative centres of its 28 provinces . Most commercial and cultural activities are centred on the capital and largest city , Sofia . The strongest sectors of the economy are heavy industry , power engineering , and agriculture , all of which rely on local natural resources . 
 The country 's current political structure dates to the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1991 . Bulgaria is a unitary parliamentary republic with a high degree of political , administrative , and economic centralisation . It is a member of the European Union , NATO , and the Council of Europe ; a founding state of the Organization for Security and Co @-@ operation in Europe ( OSCE ) ; and has taken a seat at the UN Security Council three times . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Prehistory and antiquity = = = 
 Human activity in the lands of modern Bulgaria can be traced back to the Paleolithic . Animal bones incised with man @-@ made markings from <unk> cave are assumed to be the earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans . Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the Neolithic <unk> culture , Vinča culture and the <unk> Varna culture ( fifth millennium BC ) . The latter is credited with inventing gold working and exploitation . Some of these first gold smelters produced the coins , weapons and jewellery of the Varna Necropolis treasure , the oldest in the world with an approximate age of over 6 @,@ 000 years . This site also offers insights for understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies . 
 Thracians , one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern Bulgarians , began appearing in the region during the Iron Age . In the late 6th century BC , the Persians conquered most of present @-@ day <unk> and kept it until 479 BC . With influence from the Persians , the bulk of the Thracian tribes were united in the <unk> kingdom in the 470s BC by king Teres , but were later subjugated by Alexander the Great and by the Romans in 46 AD . After the division of the Roman Empire in the 5th century the area fell under Byzantine control . By this time , Christianity had already spread in the region . A small Gothic community in Nicopolis ad <unk> produced the first Germanic language book in the 4th century , the <unk> Bible . The first Christian monastery in Europe was established around the same time by Saint Athanasius in central Bulgaria . From the 6th century the easternmost South Slavs gradually settled in the region , assimilating the Hellenised or Romanised Thracians . 
 = = = First Bulgarian Empire = = = 
 In 680 Bulgar tribes under the leadership of Asparukh moved south across the Danube and settled in the area between the lower Danube and the Balkan , establishing their capital at Pliska . A peace treaty with Byzantium in 681 marked the beginning of the First Bulgarian Empire . The Bulgars gradually mixed up with the local population , adopting a common language on the basis of the local Slavic dialect . 
 Succeeding rulers strengthened the Bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries . Krum doubled the country 's territory , killed Byzantine emperor Nicephorus I in the Battle of Pliska , and introduced the first written code of law . Paganism was abolished in favour of Eastern Orthodox Christianity under Boris I in 864 . This conversion was followed by a Byzantine recognition of the Bulgarian church and the adoption of the Cyrillic alphabet developed at Preslav which strengthened central authority and helped fuse the Slavs and Bulgars into a unified people . A subsequent cultural golden age began during the 34 @-@ year rule of Simeon the Great , who also achieved the largest territorial expansion of the state . 
 Wars with Magyars and Pechenegs and the spread of the Bogomil heresy weakened Bulgaria after Simeon 's death . Consecutive Rus ' and Byzantine invasions resulted in the seizure of the capital Preslav by the Byzantine army in 971 . Under Samuil , Bulgaria briefly recovered from these attacks , but this rise ended when Byzantine emperor Basil II defeated the Bulgarian army at Klyuch in 1014 . Samuil died shortly after the battle , and by 1018 the Byzantines had ended the First Bulgarian Empire . 
 = = = Second Bulgarian Empire = = = 
 After his conquest of Bulgaria , Basil II prevented revolts and discontent by retaining the rule of the local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold , allowing them to be paid in kind instead . He also allowed the Bulgarian Patriarchate to retain its autocephalous status and all its dioceses , but reduced it to an archbishopric . After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out , the largest being led by Peter Delyan . In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organised a major uprising which resulted in the re @-@ establishment of the Bulgarian state . Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with Tarnovo as the capital . 
 Kaloyan , the third of the Asen monarchs , extended his dominion to Belgrade and Ohrid . He acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of the pope and received a royal crown from a papal legate . The empire reached its zenith under Ivan Asen II ( 1218 – 1241 ) , when commerce and culture flourished . The strong economic and religious influence of Tarnovo made it a " Third Rome " , unlike the already declining Constantinople . 
 The country 's military and economic might declined after the Asen dynasty ended in 1257 , facing internal conflicts , constant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks and Mongol domination . By the end of the 14th century , factional divisions between the feudal landlords and the spread of <unk> had caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to split into three <unk> — Vidin , Tarnovo and Karvuna — and several semi @-@ independent principalities that fought each other , along with Byzantines , Hungarians , Serbs , Venetians and Genoese . By the late 14th century the Ottoman Turks had started their conquest of Bulgaria and had taken most towns and fortresses south of the Balkan mountains . 
 = = = Ottoman rule = = = 
 Tarnovo was captured by the Ottomans after a three @-@ month siege in 1393 . After the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396 brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom , the Ottomans conquered all Bulgarian lands south of the Danube . The nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was <unk> to Ottoman masters , with much of the educated clergy fleeing to other countries . Under the Ottoman system , Christians were considered an inferior class of people . Thus , Bulgarians , like other Christians , were subjected to heavy taxes and a small portion of the Bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete Islamisation , and their culture was suppressed . Ottoman authorities established the Rum Millet , a religious administrative community which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity . Most of the local population gradually lost its distinct national consciousness , identifying as Christians . However , the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept it alive , and that helped it to survive as in some rural , remote areas , as well as in the militant Catholic community in the northwestern part of the country . 
 Several Bulgarian revolts erupted throughout the nearly five centuries of Ottoman rule , most notably the Habsburg @-@ backed Tarnovo uprisings in 1598 and in 1686 , the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and <unk> 's Rebellion in 1689 . In the 18th century , the Enlightenment in Western Europe provided influence for the initiation of a movement known as the National awakening of Bulgaria . It restored national consciousness and became a key factor in the liberation struggle , resulting in the 1876 April Uprising . Up to 30 @,@ 000 Bulgarians were killed as Ottoman authorities put down the rebellion . The massacres prompted the Great Powers to take action . They convened the Constantinople Conference in 1876 , but their decisions were rejected by the Ottomans . This allowed the Russian Empire to seek a solution by force without risking military confrontation with other Great Powers , as had happened in the Crimean War . In 1877 Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire and defeated its forces with the help of Bulgarian volunteers . 
 = = = Third Bulgarian state = = = 
 The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire , and included a provision to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire . The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests . It was superseded by the subsequent Treaty of Berlin , signed on 13 July , provided for a much smaller state comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia , leaving large populations of Bulgarians outside the new country . This played a significant role in forming Bulgaria 's militaristic approach to foreign affairs during the first half of the 20th century . 
 The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi @-@ autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885 , proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908 . In the years following independence , Bulgaria increasingly militarised and was often referred to as " the Balkan Prussia " . 
 Between 1912 and 1918 , Bulgaria became involved in three consecutive conflicts — two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War , Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 @-@ strong army and achieving several decisive victories , at Doiran and <unk> , the country capitulated in 1918 . The war resulted in significant territorial losses , and a total of 87 @,@ 500 soldiers killed . More than 253 @,@ 000 refugees immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929 due to the effects of these wars , placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy . 
 The political unrest resulting from these losses led to the establishment of a royal authoritarian dictatorship by Tsar Boris III ( 1918 – 1943 ) . Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 as a member of the Axis but declined to participate in Operation Barbarossa and saved its Jewish population from deportation to concentration camps . The sudden death of Boris III in the summer of 1943 pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against Germany and the communist guerrilla movement gained momentum . The government of Bogdan <unk> subsequently failed to achieve peace with the Allies . Bulgaria did not comply with Soviet demands to expel German forces from its territory , resulting in a declaration of war and an invasion by the USSR in September 1944 . The communist @-@ dominated Fatherland Front took power , ended participation in the Axis and joined the Allied side until the war ended . 
 The left @-@ wing uprising of 9 September 1944 led to the abolition of monarchic rule , but it was not until 1946 that a one @-@ party people 's republic was established . It became a part of the Soviet sphere of influence under the leadership of Georgi Dimitrov ( 1946 – 1949 ) , who laid the foundations for a rapidly industrialising Stalinist state which was also highly repressive with thousands of dissidents executed . By the mid @-@ 1950s standards of living rose significantly , while political repressions were lessened . By the 1980s both national and per capita GDPs quadrupled , but the economy remained prone to debt spikes , the most severe taking place in 1960 , 1977 and 1980 . The Soviet @-@ style planned economy saw some market @-@ oriented policies emerging on an experimental level under Todor Zhivkov ( 1954 – 1989 ) . His daughter Lyudmila bolstered national pride by promoting Bulgarian heritage , culture and arts worldwide . In an attempt to erase the identity of the ethnic Turk minority , an assimilation campaign was launched in 1984 which included closing mosques and forcing ethnic Turks to adopt Slavic names . These policies ( combined with the end of communist rule in 1989 ) resulted in the emigration of some 300 @,@ 000 ethnic Turks to Turkey . 
 Under the influence of the collapsing of the Eastern Bloc , on 10 November 1989 the Communist Party gave up its political monopoly , Zhivkov resigned , and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy . The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party ( BSP , the freshly renamed Communist Party ) . A new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991 . The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth — the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s . A 1997 reform package restored economic growth , but living standards continued to suffer . After 2001 economic , political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly , and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status . It became a member of NATO in 2004 and participated in the War in Afghanistan . After several years of reforms it joined the European Union in 2007 despite continued concerns about government corruption . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Bulgaria occupies a portion of the eastern Balkan peninsula , bordering five countries — Greece and Turkey to the south , Macedonia and Serbia to the west , and Romania to the north . The land borders have a total length of 1 @,@ 808 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 123 mi ) , and the coastline has a length of 354 kilometres ( 220 mi ) . Its total area of 110 @,@ 994 square kilometres ( 42 @,@ 855 sq mi ) ranks it as the world 's 105th @-@ largest country . Bulgaria 's geographic coordinates are 43 ° N 25 ° E. 
 The most notable topographical features are the Danubian Plain , the Balkan Mountains , the Thracian Plain , and the Rhodope Mountains . The southern edge of the Danubian Plain slopes upward into the foothills of the Balkans , while the Danube defines the border with Romania . The Thracian Plain is roughly triangular , beginning southeast of Sofia and broadening as it reaches the Black Sea coast . 
 The Balkan mountains run laterally through the middle of the country . The mountainous southwest of the country has two alpine ranges — Rila and Pirin , which border the lower but more extensive Rhodope Mountains to the east . Bulgaria is home to the highest point of the Balkan peninsula , <unk> , at 2 @,@ 925 metres ( 9 @,@ 596 ft ) and its lowest point is sea level . Plains occupy about one @-@ third of the territory , while plateaus and hills occupy 41 per cent . The country has a dense network of about 540 rivers , most of which are relatively small and with low water levels . The longest river located solely in Bulgarian territory , the Iskar , has a length of 368 kilometres ( 229 mi ) . Other major rivers include the Struma and the Maritsa in the south . 
 Bulgaria has a dynamic climate , which results from its being positioned at the meeting point of Mediterranean and continental air masses and the barrier effect of its mountains . Northern Bulgaria averages 1 ° C ( 1 @.@ 8 ° F ) cooler and registers 200 millimetres ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) more precipitation annually than the regions south of the Balkan mountains . Temperature amplitudes vary significantly in different areas . The lowest recorded temperature is − 38 @.@ 3 ° C ( − 36 @.@ 9 ° F ) , while the highest is 45 @.@ 2 ° C ( 113 @.@ 4 ° F ) . Precipitation averages about 630 millimetres ( 24 @.@ 8 in ) per year , and varies from 500 millimetres ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) in Dobrudja to more than 2 @,@ 500 millimetres ( 98 @.@ 4 in ) in the mountains . Continental air masses bring significant amounts of snowfall during winter . 
 = = = Environment = = = 
 Bulgaria adopted the Kyoto Protocol and achieved the protocol 's objectives by reducing carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 to 2009 by 30 percent . However , pollution from factories and metallurgy works and severe deforestation continue to cause major problems to the health and welfare of the population . In 2013 , air pollution in Bulgaria was more severe than any other European country . Urban areas are particularly affected by energy production from coal @-@ based powerplants and automobile traffic , while pesticide usage in the agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produce extensive soil and water pollution with chemicals and detergents . Bulgaria is home to Maritsa <unk> @-@ 2 , a lignite @-@ fired power station causing the highest damage costs to health and the environment in the entire European Union according to the European Environment Agency . It is the only EU member which does not recycle municipal waste , although an electronic waste recycling plant opened in June 2010 . The situation has improved in recent years , and several government @-@ funded programs have been put into place in an attempt to reduce pollution levels . According to Yale University 's 2012 Environmental Performance Index , Bulgaria is a " modest performer " in protecting the environment . Over 75 % of surface rivers meet the standards for good quality . An improvement of water quality began in 1998 and has maintained a sustainable trend of moderate improvement . 
 = = = Biodiversity = = = 
 The interaction of climatic , hydrological , geological and topographical conditions have produced a relatively wide variety of plant and animal species . Bulgaria is one of the countries with highest biodiversity in Europe . Bulgaria 's biodiversity is conserved in three national parks , 11 nature parks and 16 biosphere reserves . Nearly 35 per cent of its land area consists of forests , where some of the oldest trees in the world , such as <unk> 's pine and the Granit oak , grow . Most of the plant and animal life is central European , although representatives of Arctic and alpine species are present at high altitudes . Its flora encompass more than 3 @,@ 800 species of which 170 are endemic and 150 are considered endangered . A checklist of larger fungi of Bulgaria reported that more than 1 @,@ 500 species occur in the country . Animal species include owls , rock partridges , <unk> and brown bears . The Eurasian lynx and the eastern imperial eagle have small , but growing populations . 
 In 1998 , the Bulgarian government approved the National Biological Diversity Conservation Strategy , a comprehensive programme seeking the preservation of local ecosystems , protection of endangered species and conservation of genetic resources . Bulgaria has some of the largest Natura 2000 areas in Europe covering 33 @.@ 8 % of its territory . 
 = = Politics = = 
 Bulgaria is a parliamentary democracy in which the most powerful executive position is that of prime minister . The political system has three branches — legislative , executive and judicial , with universal suffrage for citizens at least 18 years old . The Constitution of Bulgaria provides also possibilities of direct democracy . Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties . Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election . Normally , the prime minister @-@ elect is the leader of the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections , although this is not always the case . 
 Political parties gather in the National Assembly , which consists of 240 deputies elected to four @-@ year terms by direct popular vote . The National Assembly has the power to enact laws , approve the budget , schedule presidential elections , select and dismiss the Prime Minister and other ministers , declare war , deploy troops abroad , and ratify international treaties and agreements . The president serves as the head of state and commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the armed forces , and has the authority to return a bill for further debate , although the parliament can override the presidential veto by a simple majority vote of all members of parliament . 
 GERB @-@ backed Rosen <unk> is the elected President of Bulgaria after the presidential elections in 2011 in which he received 52 @.@ 5 per cent of the votes on the second round against 47 @.@ 5 per cent for his then @-@ Socialist Party opponent Ivaylo <unk> . 
 Until February 2013 GERB had 117 seats in the National Assembly , ruling as a minority government without support from the other political parties in the parliament . The government resigned on 20 February 2013 after nationwide protests caused by high costs of utilities , low living standards and the failure of the democratic system . The protest wave was marked by self @-@ immolations , spontaneous demonstrations and a strong sentiment against political parties . As a consequence , the Parliament was dissolved and a new provisional government was set up by the President . The subsequent snap elections in May 2013 elections resulted in a narrow GERB win . However , with no support from the other three political parties that entered the parliament , on 24 May , GERB leader Borisov returned the president 's mandate to try and form a government . The Bulgarian Socialist Party nominated ex @-@ Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski for the post of Prime Minister in May 2013 . Only two weeks after its initial formation the Oresharski government came under opposition criticism and had to deal with large @-@ scale protests some with more than 11 000 participants . The government survived five votes of no @-@ confidence before voluntarily resigning on 23 July 2014 . On 6 August , a caretaker government led by Georgi <unk> was sworn into office and the Oresharski government was officially dissolved . 
 A new round of parliamentary elections on 5 October 2014 again resulted in a GERB victory with around a third of the vote . A total of eight parties won seats , the first time since the beginning of democratic elections in 1990 that more than seven parties entered parliament . After being tasked by President Rosen <unk> to form a government , Borisov 's GERB formed a coalition and members of the parties in the Reformist Bloc ( Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria ( DSB ) , Union of Democratic Forces ( SDS ) , Bulgaria for Citizens Movement ( <unk> ) and Bulgarian Agrarian National Union ( <unk> ) ) were chosen for Minister positions . The vice chairman of the Alternative for Bulgarian Revival party Ivaylo <unk> was voted for Depute Prime Minister and Minister of Labor and Social Policy . 
 Bulgaria has a typical civil law legal system . The judiciary is overseen by the Ministry of Justice . The Supreme Administrative Court and Supreme Court of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the application of laws in subordinate courts . The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges . Bulgaria 's judiciary , along with other institutions , remains one of Europe 's most corrupt and inefficient . 
 Law enforcement is carried out by organisations mainly subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior . The National Police Service ( NPS ) combats general crime , maintains public order and supports the operations of other law enforcement agencies . NPS fields 27 @,@ 000 police officers in its local and national sections . The Ministry of Interior also heads the Border Police Service and the National Gendarmerie — a specialised branch for anti @-@ terrorist activity , crisis management and riot control . Counterintelligence and national security are the responsibility of the State Agency for National Security , established in 2008 . 
 = = = Administrative divisions = = = 
 Bulgaria is a unitary state . Since the 1880s , the number of territorial management units has varied from seven to 26 . Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces ( <unk> , singular oblast ) . A new administrative structure was adopted in parallel with the decentralisation of the economic system . It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province ( Sofia @-@ Grad ) . All areas take their names from their respective capital cities . The provinces subdivide into 264 municipalities . 
 Municipalities are run by mayors , who are elected to four @-@ year terms , and by directly elected municipal councils . Bulgaria is a highly centralised state , where the national Council of Ministers directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding . 
 = = = Foreign relations = = = 
 Bulgaria became a member of the United Nations in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non @-@ permanent member of the Security Council three times , most recently from 2002 to 2003 . Bulgaria was also among the founding nations of the Organization for Security and Co @-@ operation in Europe ( OSCE ) in 1975 . It joined NATO on 29 March 2004 , signed the European Union Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005 , and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007 . Polls carried out seven years after the country 's accession to the EU found only 15 % of Bulgarians felt they had personally benefited from membership , with almost 40 % of the population saying they would not bother to vote in the 2014 EU elections . Euro @-@ Atlantic integration became a priority for the country since the fall of Communism , although the Communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the European Communities by 1987 . 
 Bulgaria 's relationship with its neighbours since 1990 has generally been good . The country also plays an important role in promoting regional security . Bulgaria has an active tripartite economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece , maintains strong relations with EU members , the United States , and Russia , and continues to improve its traditionally good ties with China and Vietnam . The HIV trial in Libya , which followed after the imprisonment of several Bulgarian nurses in Benghazi in 1998 , had a significant impact on relations between Bulgaria , the European Union , and Libya . It resulted in the release of the nurses by Muammar Gaddafi 's government , which was granted a contract to receive a nuclear reactor and weapons supplies from France in exchange . 
 = = = Military = = = 
 Bulgaria hosted six KC @-@ 135 Stratotanker aircraft and 200 support personnel for the war effort in Afghanistan in 2001 , which was the first stationing of foreign forces on its territory since World War II . International military relations were further expanded in April 2006 , when Bulgaria and the United States signed a defence cooperation agreement providing for the usage of <unk> and Graf <unk> air bases , the Novo Selo training range , and a logistics centre in <unk> as joint military training facilities . The same year Foreign Policy magazine listed <unk> Air Base as one of the six most important overseas facilities used by the USAF due to its proximity to the Middle East . A total of 756 troops are deployed abroad as part of various UN and NATO missions . Historically , Bulgaria deployed significant numbers of military and civilian advisors in Soviet @-@ allied countries , such as Nicaragua and Libya ( more than 9 @,@ 000 personnel ) . 
 Domestic defence is the responsibility of the all @-@ volunteer military of Bulgaria , consisting of land forces , navy and air force . The land forces consist of two mechanised brigades and eight independent regiments and battalions ; the air force operates 106 aircraft and air defence systems in six air bases , and the navy operates a variety of ships , helicopters and coastal defence measures . Following a series of reductions beginning in 1990 , the number of active troops contracted from 152 @,@ 000 in 1988 to about 32 @,@ 000 in the 2000s , supplemented by a reserve force of 302 @,@ 500 soldiers and officers and 34 @,@ 000 paramilitary servicemen . The inventory is mostly of Soviet origin , such as MiG @-@ 29 fighters , SA @-@ 10 Grumble SAMs and SS @-@ 21 Scarab short @-@ range ballistic missiles . By 2020 the government will spend $ 1 @.@ 4 billion for the deployment of new fighter jets , communications systems and cyber warfare capabilities . Total military spending in 2009 cost $ 819 million . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Bulgaria has an emerging market economy in the upper middle income range , where the private sector accounts for more than 80 per cent of GDP . From a largely agricultural country with a predominantly rural population in 1948 , by the 1980s Bulgaria had transformed into an industrial economy with scientific and technological research at the top of its budgetary expenditure priorities . The loss of COMECON markets in 1990 and the subsequent " shock therapy " of the planned system caused a steep decline in industrial and agricultural production , ultimately followed by an economic collapse in 1997 . The economy largely recovered during a period of rapid growth several years later , but the average salary remains one of the lowest in the EU at 952 leva ( € 488 ) per month in March 2016 . More than a fifth of the labour force are employed on a minimum wage of € 1 per hour . Wages , however , account for only half of the total household income , owing to the substantial informal economy which amounts to almost 32 % of GDP . Bulgarian PPS GDP per capita stood at 47 per cent of the EU average in 2014 according to Eurostat data , while the cost of living was 48 per cent of the average . The currency is the lev , which is pegged to the euro at a rate of 1 @.@ <unk> <unk> for 1 euro . Bulgaria is not part of the eurozone and has abandoned its plans to adopt the euro . 
 Economic indicators have worsened amid the late @-@ 2000s financial crisis . After several consecutive years of high growth , GDP contracted 5 @.@ 5 per cent in 2009 and unemployment remains above 12 per cent . Industrial output declined 10 per cent , mining by 31 per cent , and ferrous and metal production marked a 60 per cent drop . Positive growth was restored in 2010 , although investments and consumption continue to decline steadily due to rising unemployment . The same year , intercompany debt exceeded € 51 billion , meaning that 60 per cent of all Bulgarian companies were mutually indebted . By 2012 , it had increased to € 83 billion , or 227 per cent of GDP . The government implemented strict austerity measures with IMF and EU encouragement to some positive fiscal results , but the social consequences of these measures have been " catastrophic " according to the International Trade Union Confederation . Corruption remains another obstacle to economic growth . Bulgaria is one of the most corrupt European Union members and ranks 75th in the Corruption Perceptions Index . Weak law enforcement and overall low capacity of civil service remain as challenges in curbing corruption . However , fighting against corruption has become the focus of the government because of the EU accession , and several anti @-@ corruption programs have been undertaken by different government agencies . 
 Economic activities are fostered by the lowest personal and corporate income tax rates in the EU , and the second @-@ lowest public debt of all member states at 16 @.@ 5 per cent of GDP in 2012 . In 2013 , GDP ( PPP ) was estimated at $ 119 @.@ 6 billion , with a per capita value of $ 16 @,@ 518 . Sofia and the surrounding <unk> planning area are the most developed region of the country with a per capita PPS GDP of $ 27 @,@ 282 in 2011 . Bulgaria is a net receiver of funds from the EU . The absolute amount of received funds was € 589 million in 2009 . 
 The labour force is 2 @.@ 45 million people , of whom 7 @.@ 1 per cent are employed in agriculture , 35 @.@ 2 per cent are employed in industry and 57 @.@ 7 per cent are employed in the services sector . Extraction of metals and minerals , production of chemicals , machinery and vehicle components , petroleum refining and steel are among the major industrial activities . Mining and its related industries employ a total of 120 @,@ 000 people and generate about five per cent of the country 's GDP . Bulgaria is Europe 's sixth @-@ largest coal producer . Local deposits of coal , iron , copper and lead are vital for the manufacturing and energy sectors . Almost all top export items of Bulgaria are industrial commodities such as oil products , copper products and pharmaceuticals . Bulgaria is also a net exporter of agricultural and food products , of which two @-@ thirds go to OECD countries . It is the largest global producer of perfumery essential oils such as lavender and rose oil . Agriculture has declined significantly in the past two decades . Production in 2008 amounted to only 66 per cent of that between 1999 and 2001 , while cereal and vegetable yields have dropped by nearly 40 per cent since 1990 . Of the services sector , tourism is the most significant contributor to economic growth . In recent years , Bulgaria has emerged as a travelling destination with its inexpensive resorts and beaches outside the reach of the tourist industry . Lonely Planet ranked it among its top 10 destinations for 2011 . Most of the visitors are British , Romanian , German and Russian . The capital Sofia , the medieval capital Veliko Tarnovo , coastal resorts Golden Sands and Sunny Beach and winter resorts Bansko , <unk> and <unk> are some of the locations most visited by tourists . 
 = = = Science and technology = = = 
 Bulgaria spends 0 @.@ 25 per cent of GDP on scientific research , thus having one of the lowest R & D budgets in Europe . Chronic underinvestment in research since 1990 forced many scientific professionals to leave the country . As a result , Bulgaria scores low in terms of innovation , competitiveness and high @-@ value added exports . Principal areas of research and development are energy , nanotechnology , archaeology and medicine . The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences ( BAS ) is the leading scientific establishment and employs most Bulgarian researchers in its numerous institutes . It has been active in the field of space science with <unk> @-@ 7 radiation monitoring experiments on the International Space Station and Chandrayaan @-@ 1 , and domestically developed space greenhouses on the Mir space station . Bulgaria became the sixth country in the world to have an astronaut in space with Georgi Ivanov 's flight on Soyuz 33 in 1979 . Bulgaria is an active member of CERN and has contributed to its activities with nearly 200 scientists since its accession in 1999 . 
 In the 1980s Bulgaria was known as the " Silicon Valley of the Eastern Bloc " because of its large @-@ scale computing technology exports to COMECON states . The ICT sector generates 10 per cent of GDP and employs the third @-@ largest contingent of ICT specialists in the world . A National Centre for Supercomputing Applications ( <unk> ) operates the only supercomputer in Southeastern Europe . The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences is planning to buy another supercomputer in 2015 which will be used together with Hi @-@ Tech SME 's . 
 Internet usage has increased rapidly since 2000 — the number of users grew from 430 @,@ 000 to 3 @.@ 4 million ( 48 per cent penetration rate ) in 2010 . Telephone services are widely available , and a central digital trunk line connects most regions . More than 90 per cent of fixed lines are served by the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company ( BTC ) , while mobile services are provided by three operators — <unk> , <unk> and BTC / <unk> . 
 = = = Infrastructure = = = 
 Bulgaria 's strategic geographic location and well @-@ developed energy sector make it a key European energy centre despite its lack of significant fossil fuel deposits . Nearly 34 percent of its electricity is produced by the nuclear power station at <unk> and public opinion strongly supports nuclear energy development . The rapid expansion of alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power stations make Bulgaria one of the fastest @-@ growing wind energy producers in the world . The country aims to produce 16 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020 . 
 The national road network has a total length of 40 @,@ 231 kilometres ( 24 @,@ 998 mi ) , of which 39 @,@ 587 kilometres ( 24 @,@ 598 mi ) are paved , but nearly half fall into the lowest international rating for paved roads .

Bulgaria has 6 @,@ 238 kilometres ( 3 @,@ 876 mi ) of railway track and currently a total of 81 km of high @-@ speed lines are in operation . Rail links are available with Romania , Turkey , Greece , and Serbia , and express trains serve direct routes to Kiev , Minsk , Moscow and Saint Petersburg . Sofia and Plovdiv are the country 's air travel hubs , while Varna and Burgas are the principal maritime trade ports . Varna is also scheduled to be the first station on EU territory to receive natural gas through the South Stream pipeline .

 The population of Bulgaria is 7 @,@ 364 @,@ 570 people according to the 2011 national census . The majority of the population , or 72 @.@ 5 per cent , reside in urban areas ; approximately one @-@ sixth of the total population is concentrated in Sofia . Bulgarians are the main ethnic group and comprise 84 @.@ 8 per cent of the population . Turkish and Roma minorities comprise 8 @.@ 8 and 4 @.@ 9 per cent , respectively ; some 40 smaller minorities comprise 0 @.@ 7 per cent , and 0 @.@ 8 per cent do not self @-@ identify with an ethnic group . 
 All ethnic groups speak Bulgarian , either as a first or as a second language . Bulgarian is the only language with official status and native for 85 @.@ 2 per cent of the population . The oldest written Slavic language , Bulgarian is distinguishable from the other languages in this group through certain grammatical peculiarities such as the lack of noun cases and infinitives , and a suffixed definite article . 
 Government estimates from 2003 put the literacy rate at 98 @.@ 6 per cent , with no significant difference between the sexes . Educational standards have been traditionally high , although still far from European benchmarks and in continuing deterioration for the past decade . Bulgarian students were among the highest @-@ scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001 , performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts ; by 2006 , scores in reading , math and science had deteriorated . State expenditures for education are far below the European Union average . The Ministry of Education , Youth and Science partially funds public schools , colleges and universities , sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process . The State provides free education in primary and secondary public schools . The educational process spans through 12 grades , where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level . High schools can be technical , vocational , general or specialised in a certain discipline , while higher education consists of a 4 @-@ year bachelor degree and a 1 @-@ year master 's degree . 
 The Constitution of Bulgaria defines it as a secular state with guaranteed religious freedom , but designates Orthodoxy as a " traditional " religion . The Bulgarian Orthodox Church gained autocephalous status in 927 AD , and currently has 12 dioceses and over 2 @,@ 000 priests . More than three @-@ quarters of Bulgarians subscribe to Eastern Orthodoxy . Sunni Muslims are the second @-@ largest community and constitute 10 per cent of the religious makeup , although a majority of them do not pray and find the use of Islamic veils in schools unacceptable . Less than three per cent are affiliated with other religions , 11 @.@ 8 per cent do not self @-@ identify with a religion and 21 @.@ 8 per cent refused to state their beliefs . 
 Bulgaria has a universal healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions . The National Health Insurance Fund ( <unk> ) pays a gradually increasing portion of the costs of primary healthcare . Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4 @.@ 1 per cent of GDP . The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100 @,@ 000 people , but distribution by fields of practice is uneven , there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel , and the quality of most medical facilities is poor . Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries . Bulgaria ranks 113th globally by average life expectancy , which stands at 73 @.@ 6 years for both genders . The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries , mainly cardiovascular diseases , neoplasms and respiratory diseases . 
 Bulgaria is in a state of demographic crisis . It has had negative population growth since the early 1990s , when the economic collapse caused a long @-@ lasting emigration wave . Some 937 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 people — mostly young adults — left the country by 2005 . The total fertility rate ( TFR ) was estimated in 2013 at 1 @.@ 43 children born / woman , which is below the replacement rate of 2 @.@ 1 . A third of all households consist of only one person and 75 @.@ 5 per cent of families do not have children under the age of 16 . Consequently , population growth and birth rates are among the lowest in the world while death rates are among the highest . The majority of children are born to unmarried women ( of all births 57 @.@ 4 per cent were outside marriage in 2012 ) . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Traditional Bulgarian culture contains mainly Thracian , Slavic and Bulgar heritage , along with Greek , Roman , Ottoman , Persian and Celtic influences . Nine historical and natural objects have been inscribed in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the Madara Rider , the Thracian tombs in <unk> and Kazanlak , the Boyana Church , the Rila Monastery , the Rock @-@ hewn Churches of Ivanovo , Pirin National Park , <unk> Nature Reserve and the ancient city of Nesebar . <unk> , a ritual fire @-@ dance of Thracian origin , is included in the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage . Fire is an essential element of Bulgarian folklore , used to banish evil spirits and diseases . Bulgarian folklore personifies illnesses as witches and has a wide range of creatures , including <unk> , samodiva ( <unk> ) and <unk> . Some of the customs and rituals against these spirits have survived and are still practised , most notably the <unk> and <unk> . <unk> is also widely celebrated . 
 Slavic culture was centred in both the First and Second Bulgarian Empires during much of the Middle Ages . The Preslav , Ohrid and Tarnovo literary schools exerted considerable cultural influence over the Eastern Orthodox world . Many languages in Eastern Europe and Asia use Cyrillic script , which originated in the Preslav Literary School around the 9th century . The medieval advancement in the arts and letters ended with the Ottoman conquest when many masterpieces were destroyed , and artistic activities did not re @-@ emerge until the National Revival in the 19th century . After the Liberation , Bulgarian literature quickly adopted European literary styles such as Romanticism and Symbolism . Since the beginning of the 20th century , several Bulgarian authors , such as Ivan Vazov , <unk> Slaveykov , <unk> <unk> , Yordan <unk> and Tzvetan Todorov have gained prominence . In 1981 Bulgarian @-@ born writer Elias Canetti was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature . 
 Bulgarian folk music is by far the most extensive traditional art and has slowly developed throughout the ages as a fusion of Eastern and Western influences . It contains Far Eastern , Oriental , medieval Eastern Orthodox and standard Western European tonalities and modes . The music has a distinctive sound and uses a wide range of traditional instruments , such as <unk> , <unk> ( bagpipe ) , <unk> and <unk> . One of its most distinguishing features is extended rhythmical time , which has no equivalent in the rest of European music . The State Television Female Vocal Choir is the most famous performing folk ensemble , and received a Grammy Award in 1990 . Bulgaria 's written musical composition can be traced back to the early Middle Ages and the works of Yoan <unk> ( c . 1280 – 1360 ) . Classical music , opera and ballet are represented by composers <unk> <unk> , Pancho <unk> and Georgi <unk> and singers <unk> <unk> , Boris <unk> and Nikolay <unk> . Bulgarian performers have gained popularity in several other genres like progressive rock ( FSB ) , electropop ( Mira <unk> ) and jazz ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 The religious visual arts heritage includes frescoes , murals and icons , many produced by the medieval Tarnovo Artistic School . Vladimir Dimitrov , Nikolay <unk> and Christo are some of the most famous modern Bulgarian artists . Film industry remains weak : in 2010 , Bulgaria produced three feature films and two documentaries with public funding . Cultural events are advertised in the largest media outlets , including the Bulgarian National Radio , and daily newspapers <unk> Trud , <unk> and 24 <unk> . 
 While major sections of Bulgaria 's media are controlled by state entities , including Bulgarian National Television , the Bulgarian National Radio , and the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency , reporting is generally deemed to be unbiased by direct government interference , although there is no specific legislation to maintain this . Written media has no legal restrictions , and a large number of private television and radio stations also exist . Despite this , traditional Bulgarian media outlets are experiencing negative economic and political pressures , and instances of self @-@ censorship have emerged . Meanwhile , internet media is growing in popularity due to its lack of censorship and the diversity of content and opinions it presents . 
 Bulgarian cuisine is similar to those of other Balkan countries and demonstrates a strong Turkish and Greek influence . Yogurt , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> salad , <unk> and <unk> are among the best @-@ known local foods . Oriental dishes such as moussaka , <unk> , and baklava are also present . Meat consumption is lower than the European average , given a notable preference for a large variety of salads . <unk> is a traditional fruit brandy which was consumed in Bulgaria as early as the 14th century . Bulgarian wine is known for its Traminer , Muskat and <unk> types , of which up to 200 @,@ 000 tonnes are produced annually . Until 1989 , Bulgaria was the world 's second @-@ largest wine exporter . 
 Bulgaria performs well in sports such as wrestling , weight @-@ lifting , boxing , gymnastics , volleyball , football and tennis . The country fields one of the leading men 's volleyball teams , ranked sixth in the world according to the 2013 FIVB rankings . Football is by far the most popular sport . Some famous players are AS Monaco forward Dimitar Berbatov and Hristo Stoichkov , winner of the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball and the most successful Bulgarian player of all time . Prominent domestic clubs include PFC CSKA Sofia and PFC Levski Sofia . The best performance of the national team at FIFA World Cup finals came in 1994 , when it advanced to the semi @-@ finals by defeating consecutively Greece , Argentina , Mexico and Germany , finishing fourth . Bulgaria has participated in most Olympic competitions since its first appearance at the 1896 games , when it was represented by Charles <unk> . The country has won a total of 218 medals : 52 gold , 86 silver , and 80 bronze , which puts it in 24th place in the all @-@ time ranking . 
 = Ming dynasty = 
 The Ming dynasty was the ruling dynasty of China — then known as the Empire of the Great Ming — for 276 years ( 1368 – 1644 ) following the collapse of the Mongol @-@ led Yuan dynasty . The Ming , described by some as " one of the greatest eras of orderly government and social stability in human history , " was the last dynasty in China ruled by ethnic Han Chinese . Although the primary capital of Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng ( who established the Shun dynasty , soon replaced by the Manchu @-@ led Qing dynasty ) , regimes loyal to the Ming throne – collectively called the Southern Ming – survived until 1683 . 
 The Hongwu Emperor ( ruled 1368 – 98 ) attempted to create a society of self @-@ sufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid , immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty : the empire 's standing army exceeded one million troops and the navy 's dockyards in Nanjing were the largest in the world . He also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates , <unk> his many sons throughout China and attempting to guide these princes through the Huang Ming Zu Xun , a set of published dynastic instructions . This failed spectacularly when his teenage successor , the Jianwen Emperor , attempted to curtail his uncles ' power , prompting the <unk> Campaign , an uprising that placed the Prince of Yan upon the throne as the Yongle Emperor in 1402 . The Yongle Emperor established Yan as a secondary capital and renamed it Beijing , constructed the Forbidden City , and restored the Grand Canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments . He rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the Confucian scholar @-@ bureaucrats . One , Zheng He , led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the Indian Ocean as far as Arabia and the eastern coasts of Africa . 
 The rise of new emperors and new factions diminished such extravagances ; the capture of the Zhengtong Emperor during the 1449 Tumu Crisis ended them completely . The imperial navy was allowed to fall into disrepair while forced labor constructed the Liaodong palisade and connected and fortified the Great Wall of China into its modern form . Wide @-@ ranging censuses of the entire empire were conducted <unk> , but the desire to avoid labor and taxes and the difficulty of storing and reviewing the enormous archives at Nanjing hampered accurate figures . Estimates for the late @-@ Ming population vary from 160 to 200 million , but necessary revenues were squeezed out of smaller and smaller numbers of farmers as more disappeared from the official records or " donated " their lands to tax @-@ exempt eunuchs or temples . Haijin laws intended to protect the coasts from " Japanese " pirates instead turned many into smugglers and pirates themselves . 
 By the 16th century , however , the expansion of European trade — albeit restricted to islands near Guangzhou like Macau — spread the Columbian Exchange of crops , plants , and animals into China , introducing chili peppers to Sichuan cuisine and highly productive corn and potatoes , which diminished famines and spurred population growth . The growth of Portuguese , Spanish , and Dutch trade created new demand for Chinese products and produced a massive influx of Japanese and American silver . This abundance of specie <unk> the Ming economy , whose paper money had suffered repeated hyperinflation and was no longer trusted . While traditional Confucians opposed such a prominent role for commerce and the newly rich it created , the heterodoxy introduced by Wang Yangming permitted a more accommodating attitude . Zhang Juzheng 's initially successful reforms proved devastating when a slowdown in agriculture produced by the Little Ice Age joined changes in Japanese and Spanish policy that quickly cut off the supply of silver now necessary for farmers to be able to pay their taxes . Combined with crop failure , floods , and epidemic , the dynasty collapsed before the rebel leader Li Zicheng , who was defeated by the Manchu @-@ led Eight Banner armies who founded the Qing dynasty .

 The Mongol @-@ led Yuan dynasty ( 1271 – 1368 ) ruled before the establishment of the Ming dynasty . Explanations for the demise of the Yuan include institutionalized ethnic discrimination against Han Chinese that stirred resentment and rebellion , <unk> of areas hard @-@ hit by inflation , and massive flooding of the Yellow River as a result of the abandonment of irrigation projects . Consequently , agriculture and the economy were in shambles , and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands of peasants called upon to work on repairing the dykes of the Yellow River . A number of Han Chinese groups revolted , including the Red Turbans in 1351 . The Red Turbans were affiliated with the White Lotus , a Buddhist secret society . Zhu Yuanzhang was a penniless peasant and Buddhist monk who joined the Red Turbans in 1352 ; he soon gained a reputation after marrying the foster daughter of a rebel commander . In 1356 , Zhu 's rebel force captured the city of Nanjing , which he would later establish as the capital of the Ming dynasty . 
 With the Yuan dynasty crumbling , competing rebel groups began fighting for control of the country and thus the right to establish a new dynasty . In 1363 , Zhu Yuanzhang eliminated his arch rival and leader of the rebel Han faction , Chen <unk> , in the Battle of Lake Poyang , arguably the largest naval battle in history . Known for its ambitious use of fire ships , Zhu 's force of 200 @,@ 000 Ming sailors were able to defeat a Han rebel force over triple their size , claimed to be 650 @,@ 000 @-@ strong . The victory destroyed the last opposing rebel faction , leaving Zhu Yuanzhang in uncontested control of the bountiful Yangtze River Valley and cementing his power in the south . After the dynastic head of the Red Turbans suspiciously died in 1367 while a guest of Zhu , there was no one left who was remotely capable of contesting his march to the throne , and he made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the Yuan capital Dadu ( present @-@ day Beijing ) in 1368 . The last Yuan emperor fled north to <unk> , and Zhu declared the founding of the Ming dynasty after razing the Yuan palaces in Dadu to the ground ; the city was renamed Beiping in the same year . Zhu Yuanzhang took Hongwu , or " Vastly Martial " , as his era name . 
 = = = = Reign of the Hongwu Emperor = = = = 
 Hongwu made an immediate effort to rebuild state infrastructure . He built a 48 km ( 30 mi ) long wall around Nanjing , as well as new palaces and government halls . The History of Ming states that as early as 1364 Zhu Yuanzhang had begun drafting a new Confucian law code , the Da Ming Lü , which was completed by 1397 and repeated certain clauses found in the old Tang Code of 653 . Hongwu organized a military system known as the <unk> , which was similar to the fubing system of the Tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 ) . 
 In 1380 Hongwu had the Chancellor Hu <unk> executed upon suspicion of a conspiracy plot to overthrow him ; after that Hongwu abolished the Chancellery and assumed this role as chief executive and emperor , a precedent mostly followed throughout the Ming period . With a growing suspicion of his ministers and subjects , Hongwu established the <unk> , a network of secret police drawn from his own palace guard . Some 100 @,@ 000 people were executed in a series of purges during his rule . 
 The Hongwu emperor issued many edicts forbidding Mongol practices and proclaiming his intention to purify China of barbarian influence . However , he also sought to use the Yuan legacy to legitimize his authority in China and other areas ruled by the Yuan . He adopted many Yuan military practices , recruited Mongol soldiers , and continued to request Korean concubines and eunuchs .

 In Qinghai , the Salar Muslims voluntarily came under Ming rule , their clan leaders capitulating around 1370 . Uyghur troops under Uyghur general Hala Bashi suppressed the Miao Rebellions of the 1370s and settled in Changde , Hunan . Hui Muslim troops also settled in Changde , Hunan after serving the Ming in campaigns against other aboriginal tribes . In 1381 , the Ming dynasty annexed the areas of the southwest that had once been part of the Kingdom of Dali following the successful effort by Hui Muslim Ming armies to defeat Yuan @-@ loyalist Mongol and Hui Muslim troops holding out in Yunnan province . The Hui troops under General Mu Ying , who was appointed Governor of Yunnan , were resettled in the region as part of a colonization effort . By the end of the 14th century , some 200 @,@ 000 military colonists settled some 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 mu ( 350 @,@ 000 acres ) of land in what is now Yunnan and Guizhou . Roughly half a million more Chinese settlers came in later periods ; these migrations caused a major shift in the ethnic make @-@ up of the region , since formerly more than half of the population were non @-@ Han peoples . Resentment over such massive changes in population and the resulting government presence and policies sparked more Miao and Yao revolts in 1464 to 1466 , which were crushed by an army of 30 @,@ 000 Ming troops ( including 1 @,@ 000 Mongols ) joining the 160 @,@ 000 local Guangxi ( see Miao Rebellions ( Ming dynasty ) ) . After the scholar and philosopher Wang Yangming ( 1472 – 1529 ) suppressed another rebellion in the region , he advocated single , unitary administration of Chinese and indigenous ethnic groups in order to bring about sinification of the local peoples . 
 = = = = Campaign in the North @-@ East = = = = 
 After the overthrow of the Mongol Yuan dynasty by the Ming dynasty in 1368 , Manchuria remained under control of the Mongols of the Northern Yuan dynasty based in Mongolia . Naghachu , a former Yuan official and a <unk> general of the Northern Yuan dynasty , won hegemony over the Mongol tribes in Manchuria ( <unk> province of the former Yuan dynasty ) . He grew strong in the northeast , with forces large enough ( numbering hundreds of thousands ) to threaten invasion of the newly founded Ming dynasty in order to restore the Mongols to power in China . The Ming decided to defeat him instead of waiting for the Mongols to attack . In 1387 the Ming sent a military campaign to attack Naghachu , which concluded with the surrender of Naghachu and Ming conquest of Manchuria . 
 The early Ming court could not , and did not , aspire to the control imposed upon the Jurchens in Manchuria by the Mongols , yet it created a norm of organization that would ultimately serve as the principal vehicle for the relations with peoples along the northeast frontiers . By the end of the Hongwu reign , the essentials of a policy toward the Jurchens had taken shape . Most of the inhabitants of Manchuria , except for the wild Jurchens , were at peace with China . The Ming had created many guards ( <unk> , wei ) in Manchuria , but the creation of a guard did not necessarily imply political control . In 1409 , the Ming dynasty under Yongle Emperor established the <unk> Regional Military Commission on the banks of the Amur River , and <unk> , a eunuch of <unk> Jurchen derivation , was ordered to lead an expedition to the mouth of the Amur to pacify the Wild Jurchens . After the death of Yongle Emperor , the <unk> Regional Military Commission was abolished in 1435 , and the Ming court ceased to have substantial activities there , although the guards continued to exist in Manchuria . By the late Ming period , Ming political presence in Manchuria had waned considerably . 
 = = = = Relations with Tibet = = = = 
 The Mingshi – the official history of the Ming dynasty compiled by the Qing dynasty in 1739 – states that the Ming established itinerant commanderies overseeing Tibetan administration while also renewing titles of ex @-@ Yuan dynasty officials from Tibet and conferring new princely titles on leaders of Tibetan Buddhist sects . However , Turrell V. Wylie states that censorship in the Mingshi in favor of bolstering the Ming emperor 's prestige and reputation at all costs obfuscates the nuanced history of Sino @-@ Tibetan relations during the Ming era . 
 Modern scholars debate whether the Ming dynasty had sovereignty over Tibet . Some believe it was a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the Jiajing Emperor ( r . 1521 – 67 ) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court . Others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship . Others note the Ming need for Central Asian horses and the need to maintain the tea @-@ horse trade . 
 The Ming sporadically sent armed forays into Tibet during the 14th century , which the Tibetans successfully resisted . Several scholars point out that unlike the preceding Mongols , the Ming dynasty did not garrison permanent troops in Tibet . The Wanli Emperor ( r . 1572 – 1620 ) attempted to reestablish Sino @-@ Tibetan relations in the wake of a Mongol @-@ Tibetan alliance initiated in 1578 , an alliance which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent Manchu Qing dynasty ( 1644 – 1912 ) in their support for the Dalai Lama of the Yellow Hat sect . By the late 16th century , the Mongols proved to be successful armed protectors of the Yellow Hat Dalai Lama after their increasing presence in the Amdo region , culminating in the conquest of Tibet by Güshi Khan ( 1582 – 1655 ) in 1642 , establishing the <unk> Khanate .

 The Hongwu Emperor specified his grandson Zhu Yunwen as his successor , and he assumed the throne as the Jianwen Emperor ( 1398 – 1402 ) after Hongwu 's death in 1398 . The most powerful of Hongwu 's sons , Zhu Di , then the militarily mighty disagreed with this , and soon a political showdown erupted between him and his nephew Jianwen . After Jianwen arrested many of Zhu Di 's associates , Zhu Di plotted a rebellion that sparked a three @-@ year civil war . Under the pretext of rescuing the young Jianwen from corrupting officials , Zhu Di personally led forces in the revolt ; the palace in Nanjing was burned to the ground , along with Jianwen himself , his wife , mother , and courtiers . Zhu Di assumed the throne as the Yongle Emperor ( 1402 – 1424 ) ; his reign is universally viewed by scholars as a " second founding " of the Ming dynasty since he reversed many of his father 's policies . 
 = = = = New capital and foreign engagement = = = = 
 Yongle demoted Nanjing to a secondary capital and in 1403 announced the new capital of China was to be at his power base in Beijing . Construction of a new city there lasted from 1407 to 1420 , employing hundreds of thousands of workers daily . At the center was the political node of the Imperial City , and at the center of this was the Forbidden City , the palatial residence of the emperor and his family . By 1553 , the Outer City was added to the south , which brought the overall size of Beijing to 4 by 4 ½ miles . 
 Beginning in 1405 , the Yongle Emperor entrusted his favored eunuch commander Zheng He ( 1371 – 1433 ) as the admiral for a gigantic new fleet of ships designated for international tributary missions . The Chinese had sent diplomatic missions over land since the Han dynasty ( 202 BCE – 220 CE ) and engaged in private overseas trade , but these missions were unprecedented in grandeur and scale . To service seven different tributary voyages , the Nanjing shipyards constructed two thousand vessels from 1403 to 1419 , including treasure ships measuring 112 m ( 370 ft ) to 134 m ( 440 ft ) in length and 45 m ( 150 ft ) to 54 m ( 180 ft ) in width . 
 Yongle also used woodblock printing to spread Chinese culture , and used the military ( especially cavalry ) to expand China 's borders . This included the brief occupation of Vietnam , from the initial invasion in 1406 until the Ming withdrawal in 1427 as a result of protracted guerrilla warfare led by the subsequent founder of the Vietnamese Lê dynasty . 
 = = = Tumu Crisis and the Ming Mongols = = = 
 The Oirat leader Esen <unk> launched an invasion into Ming China in July 1449 . The chief eunuch Wang Zhen encouraged the Zhengtong Emperor ( r . 1435 – 49 ) to lead a force personally to face the Oirats after a recent Ming defeat ; the emperor left the capital and put his half @-@ brother Zhu <unk> in charge of affairs as temporary regent . On 8 September , Esen routed Zhengtong 's army , and Zhengtong was captured — an event known as the Tumu Crisis . The Oirats held the Zhengtong Emperor for ransom . However , this scheme was foiled once the emperor 's younger brother assumed the throne under the era name Jingtai ( r . 1449 – 57 ) ; the Oirats were also repelled once the Jingtai Emperor 's confidant and defense minister Yu Qian ( 1398 – 1457 ) gained control of the Ming armed forces . Holding the Zhengtong Emperor in captivity was a useless bargaining chip for the Oirats as long as another sat on his throne , so they released him back into Ming China . The former emperor was placed under house arrest in the palace until the coup against the Jingtai Emperor in 1457 known as the " <unk> the Gate Incident " . The former emperor retook the throne under the new era name Tianshun ( r . 1457 – 64 ) . 
 Tianshun proved to be a troubled time and Mongol forces within the Ming military structure continued to be problematic . On 7 August 1461 , the Chinese general Cao Qin and his Ming troops of Mongol descent staged a coup against the Tianshun Emperor out of fear of being next on his purge @-@ list of those who aided him in the <unk> the Gate Incident . Cao 's rebel force managed to set fire to the western and eastern gates of the Imperial City ( doused by rain during the battle ) and killed several leading ministers before his forces were finally cornered and he was forced to commit suicide . 
 While the Yongle Emperor had staged five major offensives north of the Great Wall against the Mongols and the Oirats , the constant threat of Oirat incursions prompted the Ming authorities to fortify the Great Wall from the late 15th century to the 16th century ; nevertheless , John Fairbank notes that " it proved to be a futile military gesture but vividly expressed China 's siege mentality . " Yet the Great Wall was not meant to be a purely defensive fortification ; its towers functioned rather as a series of lit beacons and signalling stations to allow rapid warning to friendly units of advancing enemy troops .

 The financial drain of the Imjin War in Korea against the Japanese was one of the many problems — fiscal or other — facing Ming China during the reign of the Wanli Emperor ( 1572 – 1620 ) . In the beginning of his reign , Wanli surrounded himself with able advisors and made a conscientious effort to handle state affairs . His Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng ( 1572 – 82 ) built up an effective network of alliances with senior officials . However , there was no one after him skilled enough to maintain the stability of these alliances ; officials soon banded together in opposing political factions . Over time Wanli grew tired of court affairs and frequent political quarreling amongst his ministers , preferring to stay behind the walls of the Forbidden City and out of his officials ' sight . Scholar @-@ officials lost prominence in administration as eunuchs became intermediaries between the aloof emperor and his officials ; any senior official who wanted to discuss state matters had to persuade powerful eunuchs with a bribe simply to have his demands or message relayed to the emperor . 
 = = = = Role of eunuchs = = = = 
 The Hongwu Emperor forbade eunuchs to learn how to read or engage in politics . Whether or not these restrictions were carried out with absolute success in his reign , eunuchs during the Yongle Emperor 's reign and afterwards managed huge imperial workshops , commanded armies , and participated in matters of appointment and promotion of officials . The eunuchs developed their own bureaucracy that was organized parallel to but was not subject to the civil service bureaucracy . Although there were several dictatorial eunuchs throughout the Ming , such as Wang Zhen , Wang Zhi , and Liu Jin , excessive tyrannical eunuch power did not become evident until the 1590s when the Wanli Emperor increased their rights over the civil bureaucracy and granted them power to collect provincial taxes . 
 The eunuch Wei <unk> ( 1568 – 1627 ) dominated the court of the <unk> Emperor ( r . 1620 – 1627 ) and had his political rivals tortured to death , mostly the vocal critics from the faction of the Donglin Society . He ordered temples built in his honor throughout the Ming Empire , and built personal palaces created with funds allocated for building the previous emperor 's tombs . His friends and family gained important positions without qualifications . Wei also published a historical work lambasting and belittling his political opponents . The instability at court came right as natural calamity , pestilence , rebellion , and foreign invasion came to a peak . The Chongzhen Emperor ( r . 1627 – 44 ) had Wei dismissed from court , which led to Wei 's suicide shortly after . 
 = = = = Economic breakdown and natural disasters = = = = 
 During the last years of the Wanli era and those of his two successors , an economic crisis developed that was centered on a sudden widespread lack of the empire 's chief medium of exchange : silver . The Portuguese first established trade with China in 1516 , trading Japanese silver for Chinese silk , and after some initial hostilities gained consent from the Ming court in 1557 to settle Macau as their permanent trade base in China . Their role in providing silver was gradually surpassed by the Spanish , while even the Dutch challenged them for control of this trade . Philip IV of Spain ( reigned 1621 – 1665 ) began cracking down on illegal smuggling of silver from New Spain and Peru across the Pacific through the Philippines towards China , in favor of shipping American @-@ mined silver through Spanish ports . In 1639 the new Tokugawa regime of Japan shut down most of its foreign trade with European powers , cutting off another source of silver coming into China . These events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces . People began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it , forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline . In the 1630s a string of one thousand copper coins equaled an ounce of silver ; by 1640 that sum could fetch half an ounce ; and , by 1643 only one @-@ third of an ounce . For peasants this meant economic disaster , since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and crop sales in copper . 
 <unk> became common in northern China in the early 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season — effects of a larger ecological event now known as the Little Ice Age . Famine , alongside tax increases , widespread military desertions , a declining relief system , and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood @-@ control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility . The central government , starved of resources , could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities . Making matters worse , a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan , killing an unknown but large number of people . The deadliest earthquake of all time , the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556 , occurred during the Jiajing Emperor 's reign , killing approximately 830 @,@ 000 people .

 A Jurchen tribal leader named Nurhaci ( r . 1616 – 26 ) , starting with just a small tribe , rapidly gained control over all the Manchurian tribes . During the Japanese invasions of Korea in the 1590s , he offered to lead his tribes in support of the Ming and Joseon army . This offer was declined , but he was granted honorific Ming titles for his gesture . Recognizing the weakness of Ming authority north of their border , he united all of the adjacent northern tribes and consolidated power in the region surrounding his homeland as the Jurchen Jin dynasty had done previously . In 1610 , he broke relations with the Ming court , and in 1618 demanded a tribute from them to redress " Seven Grievances " . 
 By 1636 , Nurhaci 's son Huang Taiji renamed his dynasty from the " Later Jin " to the " Great Qing " at Shenyang , which had fallen to Qing forces in 1621 and was made their capital in 1625 . Huang Taiji also adopted the Chinese imperial title huangdi , declared the <unk> ( " <unk> Virtue " ) era , and changed the ethnic name of his people from " Jurchen " to " Manchu " . In 1638 the Manchu defeated and conquered Ming China 's traditional ally Joseon with an army of 100 @,@ 000 troops in the Second Manchu invasion of Korea . Shortly after , the Koreans renounced their long @-@ held loyalty to the Ming dynasty .

 A peasant soldier named Li Zicheng mutinied with his fellow soldiers in western Shaanxi in the early 1630s after the Ming government failed to ship much @-@ needed supplies there . In 1634 he was captured by a Ming general and released only on the terms that he return to service . The agreement soon broke down when a local magistrate had thirty @-@ six of his fellow rebels executed ; Li 's troops retaliated by killing the officials and continued to lead a rebellion based in <unk> , central Henan province by 1635 . By the 1640s , an ex @-@ soldier and rival to Li — Zhang Xianzhong ( 1606 – 47 ) — had created a firm rebel base in Chengdu , Sichuan , while Li 's center of power was in Hubei with extended influence over Shaanxi and Henan . 
 In 1640 , masses of Chinese peasants who were starving , unable to pay their taxes , and no longer in fear of the frequently defeated Chinese army , began to form into huge bands of rebels . The Chinese military , caught between fruitless efforts to defeat the Manchu raiders from the north and huge peasant revolts in the provinces , essentially fell apart . Unpaid and unfed , the army was defeated by Li Zicheng — now self @-@ styled as the Prince of Shun — and deserted the capital without much of a fight . On 26 May 1644 , Beijing fell to a rebel army led by Li Zicheng when the city gates were treacherously opened from within . During the turmoil , the last Ming emperor hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City . 
 Seizing opportunity , the Eight Banners crossed the Great Wall after the Ming border general Wu Sangui ( 1612 – 1678 ) opened the gates at Shanhai Pass . This occurred shortly after he learned about the fate of the capital and an army of Li Zicheng marching towards him ; weighing his options of alliance , he decided to side with the Manchus . The Eight Banners under the Manchu Prince Dorgon ( 1612 – 50 ) and Wu Sangui approached Beijing after the army sent by Li was destroyed at Shanhaiguan ; the Prince of Shun 's army fled the capital on the fourth of June . On 6 June , the Manchus and Wu entered the capital and proclaimed the young Shunzhi Emperor ruler of China . After being forced out of Xi 'an by the Qing , chased along the Han River to Wuchang , and finally along the northern border of Jiangxi province , Li Zicheng died there in the summer of 1645 , thus ending the Shun dynasty . One report says his death was a suicide ; another states that he was beaten to death by peasants after he was caught stealing their food . 
 Scattered Ming remnants held out after 1644 , including that of Koxinga ( Zheng Chenggong ) who established the Kingdom of Tungning on Taiwan ( Formosa ) . Despite the loss of Beijing and the death of the emperor , Ming power was by no means totally destroyed . Nanjing , Fujian , Guangdong , Shanxi , and Yunnan were all strongholds of Ming resistance . However , there were several pretenders for the Ming throne , and their forces were divided . Each bastion of resistance was individually defeated by the Qing until 1662 , when the last southern Ming Emperor died , the Yongli Emperor , Zhu <unk> . The last Ming Princes to hold out were the Prince of <unk> Zhu <unk> and the son of Zhu <unk> , the Prince of Lu Zhu <unk> ( <unk> ) who stayed with Koxinga 's Ming loyalists in the Kingdom of Tungning until 1683 . Zhu <unk> was acting in the name of the dead Yongli Emperor . The Qing then sent the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives . 
 Koxinga 's grandson Zheng <unk> was rewarded by the Qing Emperor with the title " Duke of <unk> " ( <unk> ) and he and his soldiers were inducted into the Eight Banners . The Qing used Koxinga 's former rattan shield troops ( <unk> ) <unk> who were placed in the Eight Banners against Russian Cossacks at <unk> . 
 In 1725 the Qing Yongzheng Emperor bestowed the hereditary title of Marquis on a descendant of the Ming dynasty Imperial family , Zhu <unk> ( <unk> ) , who received a salary from the Qing government and whose duty was to perform rituals at the Ming tombs , and was also inducted the Chinese Plain White Banner in the Eight Banners . Later the Qianlong Emperor bestowed the title Marquis of Extended Grace posthumously on Zhu <unk> in 1750 , and the title passed on through twelve generations of Ming descendants until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912 . The last Marquis of Extended <unk> was Zhu <unk> ( <unk> ) . 
 In 1912 , after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution , some advocated that a Han be installed as Emperor , either the descendant of Confucius , who was the Duke Yansheng , or the Ming dynasty Imperial family descendant , the Marquis of Extended Grace .

 The Ming emperors took over the provincial administration system of the Yuan dynasty , and the thirteen Ming provinces are the precursors of the modern provinces . Throughout the Song dynasty , the largest political division was the circuit ( lu <unk> ) . However , after the Jurchen invasion in 1127 , the Song court established four semi @-@ autonomous regional command systems based on territorial and military units , with a detached service secretariat that would become the provincial administrations of the Yuan , Ming , and Qing dynasties . <unk> on the Yuan model , the Ming provincial bureaucracy contained three commissions : one civil , one military , and one for surveillance . Below the level of the province ( sheng <unk> ) were prefectures ( fu <unk> ) operating under a prefect ( <unk> <unk> ) , followed by subprefectures ( zhou <unk> ) under a <unk> . The lowest unit was the county ( xian <unk> ) , overseen by a magistrate . Besides the provinces , there were also two large areas that belonged to no province , but were metropolitan areas ( jing <unk> ) attached to Nanjing and Beijing .

 Departing from the main central administrative system generally known as the Three Departments and Six Ministries system , which was instituted by various dynasties since late Han ( 202 BCE – 220 CE ) , the Ming administration had only one Department , the Secretariat , that controlled the Six Ministries . Following the execution of the Chancellor Hu <unk> in 1380 , the Hongwu Emperor abolished the Secretariat , the Censorate , and the Chief Military Commission and personally took charge of the Six Ministries and the regional Five Military Commissions . Thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers . The Grand Secretariat , at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork , was instituted , but without employing grand counselors , or chancellors . 
 The Hongwu Emperor sent his heir apparent to Shaanxi in 1391 to " tour and soothe " ( <unk> ) the region ; in 1421 the Yongle Emperor commissioned 26 officials to travel the empire and uphold similar investigatory and patrimonial duties . By 1430 these <unk> assignments became institutionalized as " grand coordinators " . Hence , the Censorate was reinstalled and first staffed with investigating censors , later with censors @-@ in @-@ chief . By 1453 , the grand coordinators were granted the title vice censor @-@ in @-@ chief or assistant censor @-@ in @-@ chief and were allowed direct access to the emperor . As in prior dynasties , the provincial administrations were monitored by a travelling inspector from the Censorate . Censors had the power to impeach officials on an irregular basis , unlike the senior officials who were to do so only in triennial evaluations of junior officials . 
 Although decentralization of state power within the provinces occurred in the early Ming , the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the 1420s . By the late Ming dynasty , there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys , a system which reined in the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment . 
 = = = = Grand Secretariat and Six Ministries = = = = 
 Governmental institutions in China conformed to a similar pattern for some two thousand years , but each dynasty installed special offices and bureaus , reflecting its own particular interests . The Ming administration utilized Grand Secretaries to assist the emperor , handling paperwork under the reign of the Yongle Emperor and later appointed as top officials of agencies and Grand Preceptor , a top @-@ ranking , non @-@ functional civil service post , under the <unk> Emperor ( ruled 1424 – 25 ) . The Grand Secretariat drew its members from the Hanlin Academy and were considered part of the imperial authority , not the ministerial one ( hence being at odds with both the emperor and ministers at times ) . The Secretariat operated as a coordinating agency , whereas the Six Ministries – Personnel , Revenue , Rites , War , Justice , and Public Works – were direct administrative organs of the state : 
 The Ministry of Personnel was in charge of appointments , merit ratings , promotions , and demotions of officials , as well as granting of honorific titles . 
 The Ministry of Revenue was in charge of gathering census data , collecting taxes , and handling state revenues , while there were two offices of currency that were subordinate to it . 
 The Ministry of Rites was in charge of state ceremonies , rituals , and sacrifices ; it also oversaw registers for Buddhist and Daoist priesthoods and even the reception of envoys from tributary states . 
 The Ministry of War was in charge of the appointments , promotions , and demotions of military officers , the maintenance of military installations , equipment , and weapons , as well as the courier system . 
 The Ministry of Justice was in charge of judicial and penal processes , but had no supervisory role over the Censorate or the Grand Court of Revision . 
 The Ministry of Works had charge of government construction projects , hiring of artisans and laborers for temporary service , manufacturing government equipment , the maintenance of roads and canals , standardization of weights and measures , and the gathering of resources from the countryside . 
 = = = = Bureaus and offices for the imperial household = = = = 
 The imperial household was staffed almost entirely by eunuchs and ladies with their own bureaus . Female servants were organized into the Bureau of Palace Attendance , Bureau of Ceremonies , Bureau of Apparel , Bureau of <unk> , Bureau of the Bedchamber , Bureau of Handicrafts , and Office of Staff Surveillance . Starting in the 1420s , eunuchs began taking over these ladies ' positions until only the Bureau of Apparel with its four subsidiary offices remained . Hongwu had his eunuchs organized into the Directorate of Palace Attendants , but as eunuch power at court increased , so did their administrative offices , with eventual twelve directorates , four offices , and eight bureaus . The dynasty had a vast imperial household , staffed with thousands of eunuchs , who were headed by the Directorate of Palace Attendants . The eunuchs were divided into different directorates in charge of staff surveillance , ceremonial rites , food , utensils , documents , stables , seals , apparel , and so on . The offices were in charge of providing fuel , music , paper , and baths . The bureaus were in charge of weapons , <unk> , laundering , headgear , <unk> , textile manufacture , wineries , and gardens . At times , the most influential eunuch in the Directorate of Ceremonial acted as a de facto dictator over the state . 
 Although the imperial household was staffed mostly by eunuchs and palace ladies , there was a civil service office called the Seal Office , which cooperated with eunuch agencies in maintaining imperial seals , tallies , and stamps . There were also civil service offices to oversee the affairs of imperial princes . 
 = = = Personnel = = = 
 = = = = Scholar @-@ officials = = = = 
 The Hongwu emperor from 1373 to 1384 staffed his bureaus with officials gathered through recommendations only . After that the scholar @-@ officials who populated the many ranks of bureaucracy were recruited through a rigorous examination system that was initially established by the Sui dynasty ( 581 – 618 ) . Theoretically the system of exams allowed anyone to join the ranks of imperial officials ( although it was frowned upon for merchants to join ) ; in reality the time and funding needed to support the study in preparation for the exam generally limited participants to those already coming from the landholding class . However , the government did exact provincial quotas while drafting officials . This was an effort to curb monopolization of power by landholding gentry who came from the most prosperous regions , where education was the most advanced . The expansion of the printing industry since Song times enhanced the spread of knowledge and number of potential exam candidates throughout the provinces . For young schoolchildren there were printed multiplication tables and primers for elementary vocabulary ; for adult examination candidates there were mass @-@ produced , inexpensive volumes of Confucian classics and successful examination answers . 
 As in earlier periods , the focus of the examination was classical Confucian texts , while the bulk of test material centered on the Four Books outlined by Zhu Xi in the 12th century . Ming era examinations were perhaps more difficult to pass since the 1487 requirement of completing the " eight @-@ legged essay " , a departure from basing essays off progressing literary trends . The exams increased in difficulty as the student progressed from the local level , and appropriate titles were accordingly awarded successful applicants . Officials were classified in nine hierarchic grades , each grade divided into two degrees , with ranging salaries ( nominally paid in <unk> of rice ) according to their rank . While provincial graduates who were appointed to office were immediately assigned to low @-@ ranking posts like the county graduates , those who passed the palace examination were awarded a jinshi ( ' presented scholar ' ) degree and assured a high @-@ level position . In 276 years of Ming rule and ninety palace examinations , the number of doctoral degrees granted by passing the palace examinations was 24 @,@ 874 . Ebrey states that " there were only two to four thousand of these jinshi at any given time , on the order of one out of 10 @,@ 000 adult males . " This was in comparison to the 100 @,@ 000 <unk> ( ' government students ' ) , the lowest tier of graduates , by the 16th century . 
 The maximum tenure in office was nine years , but every three years officials were graded on their performance by senior officials . If they were graded as superior then they were promoted , if graded adequate then they retained their ranks , and if graded inadequate they were demoted one rank . In extreme cases , officials would be dismissed or punished . Only capital officials of grade 4 and above were exempt from the scrutiny of recorded evaluation , although they were expected to confess any of their faults . There were over 4 @,@ 000 school instructors in county and prefectural schools who were subject to evaluations every nine years . The Chief Instructor on the prefectural level was classified as equal to a second @-@ grade county graduate . The Supervisorate of Imperial Instruction oversaw the education of the heir apparent to the throne ; this office was headed by a Grand Supervisor of Instruction , who was ranked as first class of grade three . 
 = = = = Lesser functionaries = = = = 
 Scholar @-@ officials who entered civil service through examinations acted as executive officials to a much larger body of non @-@ ranked personnel called lesser functionaries . They outnumbered officials by four to one ; Charles Hucker estimates that they were perhaps as many as 100 @,@ 000 throughout the empire . These lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies . Yet they should not be confused with lowly lictors , runners , and bearers ; lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank . The one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the good service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries . 
 = = = = Eunuchs , princes , and generals = = = = 
 Eunuchs gained unprecedented power over state affairs during the Ming dynasty . One of the most effective means of control was the secret service stationed in what was called the Eastern Depot at the beginning of the dynasty , later the Western Depot . This secret service was overseen by the Directorate of Ceremonial , hence this state organ 's often totalitarian affiliation . Eunuchs had ranks that were equivalent to civil service ranks , only theirs had four grades instead of nine . 
 Descendants of the first Ming emperor were made princes and given ( typically nominal ) military commands , annual stipends , and large estates . The title used was " king " ( 王 , wáng ) but – unlike the princes in the Han and Jin dynasties – these estates were not feudatories , the princes did not serve any administrative function , and they partook in military affairs only during the reigns of the first two emperors . The rebellion of the Prince of Yan was justified in part as upholding the rights of the princes , but once the Yongle Emperor was enthroned , he continued his nephew 's policy of disarming his brothers and moved their fiefs away from the militarized northern border . Although princes served no organ of state administration , the princes , consorts of the imperial princesses , and ennobled relatives did staff the Imperial Clan Court , which supervised the imperial genealogy . 
 Like scholar @-@ officials , military generals were ranked in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations every five years ( as opposed to three years for officials ) . However , military officers had less prestige than officials . This was due to their hereditary service ( instead of solely merit @-@ based ) and Confucian values that dictated those who chose the profession of violence ( wu ) over the cultured pursuits of knowledge ( wen ) . Although seen as less prestigious , military officers were not excluded from taking civil service examinations , and after 1478 the military even held their own examinations to test military skills . In addition to taking over the established bureaucratic structure from the Yuan period , the Ming emperors established the new post of the travelling military inspector . In the early half of the dynasty , men of noble lineage dominated the higher ranks of military office ; this trend was reversed during the latter half of the dynasty as men from more humble origins eventually displaced them . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 = = = Literature and arts = = = 
 Literature , painting , poetry , music , and Chinese opera of various types flourished during the Ming dynasty , especially in the economically prosperous lower Yangzi valley . 
 Although short fiction had been popular as far back as the Tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 ) , and the works of contemporaneous authors such as Xu Guangqi , Xu Xiake , and Song Yingxing were often technical and encyclopedic , the most striking literary development was the vernacular novel . While the gentry elite were educated enough to fully comprehend the language of Classical Chinese , those with rudimentary education – such as women in educated families , merchants , and shop clerks – became a large potential audience for literature and performing arts that employed Vernacular Chinese . Literati scholars edited or developed major Chinese novels into mature form in this period , such as Water Margin and Journey to the West . Jin Ping Mei , published in 1610 , although incorporating earlier material , marks the trend toward independent composition and concern with psychology . In the later years of the dynasty , Feng <unk> and Ling <unk> innovated with vernacular short fiction . Theater scripts were equally imaginative . The most famous , The Peony Pavilion , was written by Tang <unk> ( 1550 – 1616 ) , with its first performance at the Pavilion of Prince Teng in 1598 . 
 Informal essay and travel writing was another highlight . Xu Xiake ( 1587 – 1641 ) , a travel literature author , published his Travel Diaries in 404 @,@ 000 written characters , with information on everything from local geography to mineralogy . The first reference to the publishing of private newspapers in Beijing was in 1582 ; by 1638 the Beijing Gazette switched from using woodblock print to movable type printing . The new literary field of the moral guide to business ethics was developed during the late Ming period , for the readership of the merchant class . 
 In contrast to Xu Xiake , who focused on technical aspects in his travel literature , the Chinese poet and official Yuan <unk> ( 1568 – 1610 ) used travel literature to express his desires for individualism as well as autonomy from and frustration with Confucian court politics . Yuan desired to free himself from the ethical compromises that were inseparable from the career of a scholar @-@ official . This anti @-@ official sentiment in Yuan 's travel literature and poetry was actually following in the tradition of the Song dynasty poet and official Su Shi ( 1037 – 1101 ) . Yuan <unk> and his two brothers , Yuan <unk> ( 1560 – 1600 ) and Yuan <unk> ( 1570 – 1623 ) , were the founders of the Gong 'an School of letters . This highly individualistic school of poetry and prose was criticized by the Confucian establishment for its association with intense sensual lyricism , which was also apparent in Ming vernacular novels such as the Jin Ping Mei . Yet even gentry and scholar @-@ officials were affected by the new popular romantic literature , seeking courtesans as soulmates to reenact the heroic love stories that arranged marriages often could not provide or accommodate . 
 Famous painters included Ni Zan and Dong <unk> , as well as the Four Masters of the Ming dynasty , Shen Zhou , Tang Yin , Wen <unk> , and Qiu Ying . They drew upon the techniques , styles , and complexity in painting achieved by their Song and Yuan predecessors , but added techniques and styles . Well @-@ known Ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art . The artist Qiu Ying was once paid 2 @.@ 8 kg ( 100 oz ) of silver to paint a long <unk> for the eightieth birthday celebration of the mother of a wealthy patron . Renowned artists often gathered an entourage of followers , some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were full @-@ time painters . 
 The period was also renowned for ceramics and <unk> major production centers for porcelain were the imperial kilns at <unk> in Jiangxi province and Dehua in Fujian province . The Dehua porcelain factories catered to European tastes by creating Chinese export porcelain by the 16th century . Individual potters also became known , such as He <unk> , who became famous in the early 17th century for his style of white porcelain sculpture . In The Ceramic Trade in Asia , <unk> Ho estimates that about 16 % of late Ming era Chinese ceramic exports were sent to Europe , while the rest were destined for Japan and South East Asia . 
 Carved designs in lacquerware and designs glazed onto porcelain wares displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity to those in painting . These items could be found in the homes of the wealthy , alongside embroidered silks and wares in jade , ivory , and cloisonné . The houses of the rich were also furnished with rosewood furniture and feathery latticework . The writing materials in a scholar 's private study , including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood , were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal . 
 <unk> in the late Ming period centered on these items of refined artistic taste , which provided work for art dealers and even underground <unk> who themselves made imitations and false attributions . The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits . However , there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur ; Liu Tong ( died 1637 ) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art . He revealed that a Xuande era ( 1426 – 1435 ) <unk> could be authenticated by judging its sheen ; porcelain wares from the Yongle era ( 1402 – 1424 ) could be judged authentic by their thickness . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 The dominant religious beliefs during the Ming dynasty were the various forms of Chinese folk religion and the Three Teachings – Confucianism , Taoism , and Buddhism . The Yuan @-@ supported Tibetan lamas fell from favor , and the early Ming emperors particularly favored Taoism , granting its practitioners many positions in the state 's ritual offices . The Hongwu Emperor curtailed the cosmopolitan culture of the Mongol Yuan dynasty , and the prolific Prince of Ning Zhu Quan even composed one encyclopedia attacking Buddhism as a foreign " mourning cult " , deleterious to the state , and another encyclopedia that subsequently joined the Taoist canon . 
 Islam was also well @-@ established throughout China , with a history said to have begun with Sa 'd ibn Abi Waqqas during the Tang dynasty and strong official support during the Yuan . Although the Ming sharply curtailed this support , there were still several prominent Muslim figures early on , including the Hongwu Emperor 's generals Chang <unk> , Lan Yu , Ding <unk> , and Mu Ying , as well as the Yongle Emperor 's powerful eunuch Zheng He . 
 The advent of the Ming was initially devastating to Christianity : in his first year , the Hongwu Emperor declared the eighty @-@ year @-@ old Franciscan missions among the Yuan heterodox and illegal . The centuries @-@ old Nestorian church also disappeared . During the later Ming a new wave of Christian missionaries arrived – particularly Jesuits – who employed new western science and technology in their arguments for conversion . They were educated in Chinese language and culture at St. Paul 's College on Macau after its founding in 1579 . The most influential was Matteo Ricci , whose " Map of the Myriad Countries of the World " upended traditional geography throughout East Asia , and whose work with the convert Xu Guangqi led to the first Chinese translation of Euclid 's Elements in 1607 . The discovery of a Nestorian stele at Xi 'an in 1625 also permitted Christianity to be treated as an old and established faith , rather than as a new and dangerous cult . However , there were strong disagreements about the extent to which converts could continue to perform rituals to the emperor , Confucius , or their ancestors : Ricci had been very accommodating and an attempt by his successors to backtrack from this policy led to the Nanjing Incident of 1616 , which exiled four Jesuits to Macau and forced the others out of public life for six years . A series of spectacular failures by the Chinese astronomers – including missing an eclipse easily computed by Xu Guangqi and Sabatino de <unk> – and a return by the Jesuits to presenting themselves as educated scholars in the Confucian mold restored their fortunes . However , by the end of the Ming the Dominicans had begun the Chinese Rites controversy in Rome that would eventually lead to a full ban of Christianity under the Qing dynasty . 
 During his mission , Ricci was also contacted in Beijing by one of the approximately 5 @,@ 000 Kaifeng Jews and introduced them and their long history in China to Europe . However , the 1642 flood caused by Kaifeng 's Ming governor devastated the community , which lost five of its twelve families , its synagogue , and most of its Torah . 
 = = = Philosophy = = = 
 = = = = Wang Yangming 's Confucianism = = = = 
 During the Ming dynasty , the Neo @-@ Confucian doctrines of the Song scholar Zhu Xi were embraced by the court and the Chinese literati at large , although the direct line of his school was destroyed by the Yongle Emperor 's extermination of the ten degrees of kinship of Fang <unk> in 1402 . 
 The Ming scholar most influential upon subsequent generations , however , was Wang Yangming ( 1472 – 1529 ) , whose teachings were attacked in his own time for their similarity to Chan Buddhism . Building upon Zhu Xi 's concept of the " extension of knowledge " ( <unk> or <unk> ) , gaining understanding through careful and rational investigation of things and events , Wang argued that universal concepts would appear in the minds of anyone . Therefore , he claimed that anyone – no matter their pedigree or education – could become as wise as Confucius and Mencius had been and that their writings were not sources of truth but merely guides that might have flaws when carefully examined . A peasant with a great deal of experience and intelligence would then be wiser than an official who had memorized the Classics but not experienced the real world . 
 = = = = Conservative reaction = = = = 
 Other scholar @-@ bureaucrats were wary of Wang 's heterodoxy , the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office , and his overall socially rebellious message . To curb his influence , he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital . Yet his ideas penetrated mainstream Chinese thought and spurred new interest in Taoism and Buddhism . Furthermore , people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer . Wang Yangming 's disciple and salt @-@ mine worker Wang Gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives , while his follower He <unk> ( <unk> ) challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in Chinese society . His contemporary Li Zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education ; both Li and He eventually died in prison , jailed on charges of spreading " dangerous ideas " . Yet these " dangerous ideas " of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy , painting , and poetry as their male guests . 
 The liberal views of Wang Yangming were opposed by the Censorate and by the Donglin Academy , re @-@ established in 1604 . These conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox Confucian ethics . Conservatives such as Gu <unk> ( 1550 – 1612 ) argued against Wang 's idea of innate moral knowledge , stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain . These two strands of Confucian thought , hardened by Chinese scholars ' notions of obligation towards their mentors , developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state , who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court . 
 = = = Urban and rural life = = = 
 Wang Gen was able to give philosophical lectures to many commoners from different regions because – following the trend already apparent in the Song dynasty – communities in Ming society were becoming less isolated as the distance between market towns was shrinking . Schools , descent groups , religious associations , and other local voluntary organizations were increasing in number and allowing more contact between educated men and local villagers . Jonathan Spence writes that the distinction between what was town and country was blurred in Ming China , since suburban areas with farms were located just outside and in some cases within the walls of a city . Not only was the blurring of town and country evident , but also of socioeconomic class in the traditional four occupations ( Chinese : <unk> ) , since artisans sometimes worked on farms in peak periods , and farmers often traveled into the city to find work during times of dearth . 
 A variety of occupations could be chosen or inherited from a father 's line of work . This would include – but was not limited to – <unk> , ironworkers and blacksmiths , tailors , cooks and noodle @-@ makers , retail merchants , tavern , teahouse , or <unk> managers , shoemakers , seal cutters , pawnshop owners , brothel heads , and merchant bankers engaging in a proto @-@ banking system involving notes of exchange . Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had . Male <unk> fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status , regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms . Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods . Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices , specialized luxury goods , headgear , fine cloth , teas , and others . Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers . A small township also provided a place for simple schooling , news and gossip , matchmaking , religious festivals , traveling theater groups , tax collection , and bases of famine relief distribution . 
 Farming villagers in the north spent their days harvesting crops like wheat and millet , while farmers south of the Huai River engaged in intensive rice cultivation and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised . The cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of the Yangzi River ; even further south sugarcane and citrus were grown as basic crops . Some people in the mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo . Besides cutting down trees to sell wood , the poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal , and by burning oyster shells to make lime and fired pots , and weaving mats and baskets . In the north traveling by horse and carriage was most common , while in the south the myriad of rivers , canals , and lakes provided cheap and easy water transport . Although the south had the characteristic of the wealthy landlord and tenant farmers , there were on average many more owner @-@ cultivators north of the Huai River due to harsher climate , living not far above subsistence level . 
 = = Science and technology = = 
 Compared to the flourishing of science and technology in the Song dynasty , the Ming dynasty perhaps saw fewer advancements in science and technology compared to the pace of discovery in the Western world . In fact , key advances in Chinese science in the late Ming were spurred by contact with Europe . In 1626 Johann Adam Schall von Bell wrote the first Chinese treatise on the telescope , the <unk> ( Far Seeing Optic Glass ) ; in 1634 the Chongzhen Emperor acquired the telescope of the late Johann Schreck ( 1576 – 1630 ) . The heliocentric model of the solar system was rejected by the Catholic missionaries in China , but Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei 's ideas slowly trickled into China starting with the Polish Jesuit Michael <unk> ( 1612 – 59 ) in 1627 , Adam Schall von Bell 's treatise in 1640 , and finally Joseph <unk> , Alex Wylie , and John Fryer in the 19th century . Catholic Jesuits in China would promote Copernican theory at court , yet at the same time embrace the Ptolemaic system in their writing ; it was not until 1865 that Catholic missionaries in China sponsored the heliocentric model as their Protestant peers did . Although Shen Kuo ( 1031 – 95 ) and Guo Shoujing ( 1231 – 1316 ) had laid the basis for trigonometry in China , another important work in Chinese trigonometry would not be published again until 1607 with the efforts of Xu Guangqi and Matteo Ricci . Ironically , some inventions which had their origins in ancient China were reintroduced to China from Europe during the late Ming ; for example , the field mill . 
 The Chinese calendar was in need of reform since it inadequately measured the solar year at 365 ¼ days , giving an error of 10 min and 14 sec a year or roughly a full day every 128 years . Although the Ming had adopted Guo Shoujing 's <unk> calendar of 1281 , which was just as accurate as the Gregorian Calendar , the Ming Directorate of Astronomy failed to periodically readjust it ; this was perhaps due to their lack of expertise since their offices had become hereditary in the Ming and the Statutes of the Ming prohibited private involvement in astronomy . A sixth @-@ generation descendant of the <unk> Emperor , the " Prince " Zhu Zaiyu ( 1536 – 611 ) , submitted a proposal to fix the calendar in 1595 , but the ultra @-@ conservative astronomical commission rejected it . This was the same Zhu Zaiyu who discovered the system of tuning known as equal temperament , a discovery made simultaneously by Simon Stevin ( 1548 – 1620 ) in Europe . In addition to publishing his works on music , he was able to publish his findings on the calendar in 1597 . A year earlier , the memorial of Xing <unk> suggesting a calendar improvement was rejected by the Supervisor of the Astronomical Bureau due to the law banning private practice of astronomy ; Xing would later serve with Xu Guangqi in reforming the calendar ( Chinese : <unk> ) in 1629 according to Western standards . 
 When the Ming founder Hongwu came upon the mechanical devices housed in the Yuan dynasty 's palace at Khanbaliq — such as fountains with balls dancing on their jets , self @-@ operating tiger automata , dragon @-@ headed devices that spouted mists of perfume , and mechanical clocks in the tradition of Yi Xing ( 683 – 727 ) and Su Song ( 1020 – 101 ) — he associated all of them with the decadence of Mongol rule and had them destroyed . This was described in full length by the Divisional Director of the Ministry of Works , Xiao Xun , who also carefully preserved details on the architecture and layout of the Yuan dynasty palace . Later , European Jesuits such as Matteo Ricci and Nicolas Trigault would briefly mention indigenous Chinese clockworks that featured drive wheels . However , both Ricci and Trigault were quick to point out that 16th @-@ century European clockworks were far more advanced than the common time keeping devices in China , which they listed as water clocks , incense clocks , and " other instruments ... with wheels rotated by sand as if by water " ( Chinese : <unk> ) . Chinese records — namely the Yuan Shi ( Chinese : <unk> ) — describe the ' five @-@ wheeled sand clock ' , a mechanism pioneered by Zhan <unk> ( fl . 1360 – 80 ) which featured the scoop wheel of Su Song 's earlier astronomical clock and a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated , similar to European models of the time . This sand @-@ driven wheel clock was improved upon by Zhou <unk> ( fl . 1530 – 58 ) who added a fourth large gear wheel , changed gear ratios , and widened the orifice for collecting sand grains since he criticized the earlier model for clogging up too often . 
 The Chinese were intrigued with European technology , but so were visiting Europeans of Chinese technology . In 1584 , Abraham Ortelius ( 1527 – 1598 ) featured in his atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum the peculiar Chinese innovation of mounting masts and sails onto carriages , just like Chinese ships . Gonzales de Mendoza also mentioned this a year later — noting even the designs of them on Chinese silken robes — while Gerardus Mercator ( 1512 – 94 ) featured them in his atlas , John Milton ( 1608 – 74 ) in one of his famous poems , and Andreas <unk> van Braam <unk> ( 1739 – 801 ) in the writings of his travel diary in China . 
 The encyclopedist Song Yingxing ( 1587 – 1666 ) documented a wide array of technologies , metallurgic and industrial processes in his Tiangong <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ) encyclopedia of 1637 . This includes mechanical and hydraulic powered devices for agriculture and irrigation , nautical technology such as vessel types and snorkeling gear for pearl divers , the annual processes of sericulture and weaving with the loom , metallurgic processes such as the crucible technique and quenching , manufacturing processes such as for roasting iron pyrite in converting sulphide to oxide in sulfur used in gunpowder compositions — illustrating how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a still @-@ head that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and crystallize — and the use of gunpowder weapons such as a naval mine ignited by use of a rip @-@ cord and steel flint wheel . 
 Focusing on agriculture in his <unk> <unk> , the agronomist Xu Guangqi ( 1562 – 1633 ) took an interest in irrigation , fertilizers , famine relief , economic and textile crops , and empirical observation of the elements that gave insight into early understandings of chemistry . 
 There were many advances and new designs in gunpowder weapons during the beginning of the dynasty , but by the mid to late Ming the Chinese began to frequently employ European @-@ style artillery and firearms . The Huolongjing , compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen sometime before the latter 's death on 16 May 1375 ( with a preface added by Jiao in 1412 ) , featured many types of cutting @-@ edge gunpowder weaponry for the time . This includes hollow , gunpowder @-@ filled exploding cannonballs , land mines that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights , pins , and a steel <unk> to ignite the train of fuses , naval mines , fin @-@ mounted winged rockets for aerodynamic control , multistage rockets propelled by booster rockets before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth from the end of the missile ( shaped like a dragon 's head ) , and hand cannons that had up to ten barrels . 
 Li Shizhen ( 1518 – 93 ) — one of the most renowned pharmacologists and physicians in Chinese history — belonged to the late Ming period . His Bencao Gangmu is a medical text with 1 @,@ 892 entries , each entry with its own name called a gang . The mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name . Inoculation , although it can be traced to earlier Chinese folk medicine , was detailed in Chinese texts by the sixteenth century . Throughout the Ming dynasty , around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox . In regards to oral hygiene , the ancient Egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end , but the Chinese were the first to invent the modern bristle toothbrush in 1498 , although it used stiff pig hair . 
 = = Population = = 
 Sinologist historians debate the population figures for each era in the Ming dynasty . The historian Timothy Brook notes that the Ming government census figures are dubious since fiscal obligations prompted many families to underreport the number of people in their households and many county officials to underreport the number of households in their jurisdiction . Children were often underreported , especially female children , as shown by skewed population statistics throughout the Ming . Even adult women were underreported ; for example , the Daming Prefecture in North Zhili reported a population of 378 167 males and 226 982 females in 1502 . The government attempted to revise the census figures using estimates of the expected average number of people in each household , but this did not solve the widespread problem of tax registration . Some part of the gender imbalance may be attributed to the practice of female infanticide . The practice is well documented in China , going back over two thousand years , and it was described as " rampant " and " practiced by almost every family " by contemporary authors . However , the dramatically skewed sex ratios , which many counties reported exceeding 2 : 1 by 1586 , can 't likely be explained by infanticide alone . 
 The number of people counted in the census of 1381 was 59 873 305 ; however , this number dropped significantly when the government found that some 3 million people were missing from the tax census of 1391 . Even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in 1381 , the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region , where Hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace . The government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of 60 545 812 people in 1393 . In his Studies on the Population of China , Ho Ping @-@ ti suggests revising the 1393 census to 65 million people , noting that large areas of North China and frontier areas were not counted in that census . Brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after 1393 ranged between 51 and 62 million , while the population was in fact increasing . Even the Hongzhi Emperor ( r . 1487 – 505 ) remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers . William Atwell states that around 1400 the population of China was perhaps 90 million people , citing <unk> and Mote . 
 Historians are now turning to local gazetteers of Ming China for clues that would show consistent growth in population . Using the gazetteers , Brook estimates that the overall population under the <unk> Emperor ( r . 1464 – 1487 ) was roughly 75 million , despite mid @-@ Ming census figures hovering around 62 million . While prefectures across the empire in the mid @-@ Ming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size , local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till , so that many would become drifters , conmen , or wood @-@ cutters that contributed to deforestation . The Hongzhi and Zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region , while the Jiajing Emperor ( r . 1521 – 67 ) finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled in order to bring in more revenues . 
 Even with the Jiajing reforms to document migrant workers and merchants , by the late Ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population . <unk> across the empire noted this and made their own estimations of the overall population in the Ming , some guessing that it had doubled , tripled , or even grown fivefold since 1368 . Fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps 160 million in the late Ming dynasty , while Brook estimates 175 million , and Ebrey states perhaps as large as 200 million . However , a great epidemic that entered China through the northwest in 1641 ravaged the densely populated areas along the Grand Canal ; a gazetteer in northern Zhejiang noted more than half the population fell ill that year and that 90 % of the local populace in one area was dead by 1642 .

 The 2004 British Open was the second ranking event of the 2004 / 2005 snooker season , after the Grand Prix in October , which was won by world number one Ronnie O 'Sullivan — the 2004 and two @-@ time world champion — who defeated Ian McCulloch 9 – 5 in the final . It preceded the UK Championship . 
 The defending champion was seven @-@ time world champion Stephen Hendry who defeated O 'Sullivan 9 – 6 in last year 's final . Hendry was still angry at his loss at the Grand Prix to McCulloch , explaining , " The way I felt at the Grand Prix was down to the fact that I know what I ’ m still capable of " . The total prize fund was £ 200 @,@ 000 and the host broadcaster was Eurosport . O 'Sullivan was considered the favourite , with his mentor Ray Reardon saying " Ronnie is in the form of his life and looks very close to being unstoppable at the moment " . Although few top players reached the final eight in the Grand Prix , O 'Sullivan said he would not be surprised if they performed well in this tournament .

Elsewhere , Maguire whitewashed UK champion Matthew Stevens 5 – 0 , outscoring him 427 – 68 . O 'Sullivan extended his unbeaten run to 12 matches when he defeated Parrott 5 – 2 , in a match that lasted two hours and 28 minutes and which featured a lot of tactical , disjointed exchanges . He was not satisfied with his performance , however : " I was awful — if I keep playing like that they 'll have to call the <unk> to come and collect me " . 1997 world champion Ken Doherty , who was ranked seventh but had slipped to fifteenth in the provisional rankings , defeated <unk> Hann 5 – 1 , after Hann had smashed the red balls from his break @-@ off shot at 0 – 4 down , from which he fluked a red and made an 89 break . John Higgins , a three @-@ time champion who first won in 1995 , beat Drew Henry 5 – 1 , and said he would withdraw from the tournament if his pregnant wife went into labour . Hendry beat Robert Milkins 5 – 1 , and dismissed suggestions that the loss at the Grand Prix had inspired him to play better at this tournament . Murphy defeated world number four Paul Hunter 5 – 3 for his second last @-@ 16 appearance in a ranking event , and attributed the win to his happiness off the table ; Murphy — a Christian since the age of 17 — said , " My girlfriend Claire is a wonderful woman . We 've become engaged and we 're involved with a tremendous church in Rotherham " . Two @-@ time world champion and world number two Mark Williams — who became a father in May and had slipped to eighth in the provisional rankings — claimed a 5 – 1 victory over <unk> in 89 minutes .

Maguire won the third on the pink after O 'Sullivan missed the yellow . O 'Sullivan won the next with a break of 51 , before Maguire made a break of 71 in each of the final two frames . After the match , O 'Sullivan — who had won all three previous encounters against Maguire — said , " I ’ ve never seen anything like that on a snooker table before ... He 's a great player , probably the best in the world at the moment " , and even before the match , O 'Sullivan had described Maguire as " of the young ones , definitely the best " . The defeat meant that Reardon lost the £ 100 bet he placed at 150 – 1 that O 'Sullivan would win all eight of the season 's ranking events .

 In the afternoon session , Maguire took the first frame , but Higgins won the next three , compiling a 100 break in the third . Breaks of 72 , 55 , and 76 allowed Maguire to regain the lead , before Higgins took the eighth after Maguire missed a straightforward red to leave it 4 – 4 at the end of the first session . In the evening session , Higgins took the ninth , before Maguire made two breaks over 50 in the 10th . Higgins then made two consecutive century breaks , including a 144 in the 11th , which equalled his own highest break .

 = Mercedes @-@ Benz CLR = 
 The Mercedes @-@ Benz CLR was a set of racing cars developed for Mercedes @-@ Benz through a collaboration with in @-@ house tuning division Mercedes @-@ AMG and motorsports specialists HWA GmbH . Designed to meet Le Mans Grand Touring Prototype ( LMGTP ) regulations , the CLRs were intended to compete in sports car events during 1999 , most notably at the 24 Hours of Le Mans which Mercedes had last won in 1989 . It was the third in a series of sports cars raced by Mercedes , following the CLK GTRs and CLK <unk> that had debuted in 1997 and 1998 respectively . Like its predecessors the CLR retained elements of Mercedes @-@ Benz 's production cars , including a V8 engine loosely based on a design used in some models as well as bodywork based on the CLK and CL @-@ Classes . The CLR 's bodywork was lower in overall height than that used on the <unk> to produce less drag . 
 Three CLRs were entered for Le Mans in 1999 after the team performed nearly 22 @,@ 000 mi ( 35 @,@ 000 km ) of testing . The cars suffered aerodynamic instabilities along the circuit 's long high @-@ speed straight sections . The car of Australian Mark Webber became airborne and crashed in qualifying , requiring it to be rebuilt . Webber and the repaired CLR returned to the track in a final practice session on the morning of the race , but during its first lap around the circuit , the car once again became airborne and landed on its roof . Mercedes withdrew the damaged CLR but chose to continue in the race despite the accidents . The remaining cars were hastily altered and the drivers were given instructions to avoid closely following other cars . 
 Nearly four hours into the race Scotsman Peter Dumbreck was battling amongst the race leaders when his CLR suffered the same instability and became airborne , this time vaulting the circuit 's safety barriers and crashing in an open field after several somersaults . This and earlier incidents led Mercedes not only to withdraw its remaining car from the event immediately , but also to cancel the entire CLR programme and move the company out of sports car racing . The accidents led to changes in the regulations dictating the design of Le Mans racing cars as well as alterations to the circuit itself to increase safety . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1996 Mercedes @-@ Benz 's motorsports programmes included support for cars in Formula One , IndyCar , and the International Touring Car Championship ( <unk> ) . Following the collapse of the <unk> at the end of the 1996 season , Mercedes ' attention shifted to a new international series , the FIA GT Championship . Racing partners AMG were tasked with developing a design to meet the Fédération Internationale de l 'Automobile 's GT1 regulations for the new championship . The new cars , known as CLK GTRs , were designed for use both as racing and road cars available to the public , as series regulations required the racing cars to be based on production models . The CLK GTRs were successful in their debut season , winning seven of eleven races and earning both the drivers ' and teams ' championships . 
 For the 1998 season AMG refined the CLK GTR 's design with the launch of the new CLK LM . A major change for the new design was the replacement of the CLK GTR 's V12 engine with a smaller V8 , thought by Mercedes to be more suitable to take on longer endurance events such as the 24 Hours of Le Mans , a race not part of the FIA GT calendar . Despite earning pole position for Le Mans , the new cars were unreliable and both lasted less than three hours before retiring from mechanical failures . The race was won by Mercedes ' FIA GT rivals Porsche . Mercedes did go on to win its second straight FIA GT Championships later that year after winning all ten races . 
 After the dominance of Mercedes , most of the GT1 class competitors chose to not return to the FIA GT Championship for 1999 , leading the FIA to eliminate the category from the series . The Automobile Club de l 'Ouest ( ACO ) , organisers of the 24 Hours of Le Mans , chose to follow the FIA 's lead and no longer allow GT1 category cars to enter Le Mans . While FIA GT concentrated solely on its lower GT2 category in 1999 , the ACO created a new category of race car known as a Le Mans Grand Touring Prototype ( LMGTP ) . The LMGTP regulations for closed @-@ cockpit cars were similar to the former GT1 regulations but shared many elements with the ACO 's existing open @-@ cockpit Le Mans Prototype ( LMP ) category . Mercedes , no longer able to compete in the FIA GT Championship with the CLK <unk> , chose to concentrate on the ACO 's new LMGTP category . 
 = = Development = = 
 Work on designing a new car to meet LMGTP regulations began in September 1998 as Mercedes was closing out its second FIA GT Championship season . Development was led by HWA GmbH , the motorsports division of AMG , which became an independent company the following year . The LMGTP rules did not require road versions of the cars to be built , so Gerhard Ungar , chief designer for HWA , was free to develop the CLR without concern for road legality issues or the inclusion of driver comforts . The transition from GT1 to LMGTP also allowed a decrease in the minimum allowed weight , from 950 kg ( 2 @,@ 090 lb ) to 900 kg ( 2 @,@ 000 lb ) . The new design had a much smaller cockpit monocoque made from carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb . The monocoque derived the design of its lower half from the CLK LM 's combination of carbon fibre and steel tube frame , but required a full carbon and aluminium upper half because of new load tests mandatory for LMGTP cockpits . The bodywork of the CLR was also 10 cm ( 4 in ) shorter in overall height compared to the CLK LM , while the nose was substantially lower and flatter than its predecessor due to a shorter wheelbase allowing longer overhangs . Aerodynamic development on the design was carried out at the University of Stuttgart 's wind tunnel and assisted by the aerodynamic specialists Fondmetal Technologies . Aerodynamic emphasis was placed on low drag for maximum top speed . Mercedes @-@ Benz 's brand image was also retained with the reuse of CLK @-@ Class tail lights from the CLK LM and a front grill and headlights based on the then @-@ new CL @-@ Class . 
 The engine for the CLR was also a variant of the design used on the CLK LM . The <unk> 32 valve V8 was loosely based on the M119 engine used in Mercedes @-@ Benz road cars at that time . A previous variant of the M119 had won Le Mans for Mercedes in 1989 . Displacement was increased from 5 @.@ 0 L ( 310 cu in ) to 5 @.@ 7 L ( 350 cu in ) to compensate for the new air restrictor limitations in the LMGTP category , which allowed the motor to produce approximately 600 bhp ( 450 kW ; 610 PS ) . The first engine was completed and began testing in December 1998 . The <unk> 6 @-@ speed sequential gearbox came directly from the CLK LM , while Bridgestone continued as the team 's tyre supplier . The suspension setup from the CLK LM was largely carried over to the CLR , although a central spring was added to the rear suspension . 
 Mercedes publicly announced its CLR programme in February 1999 just days before the first car began private testing at California Speedway in the United States . Testing continued into March at California as well as Homestead @-@ Miami Speedway in Florida before the team moved to the Circuit de Nevers Magny @-@ Cours in France . At Magny @-@ Cours three CLRs completed a 30 @-@ hour test session covering 8 @,@ 073 mi ( 12 @,@ 992 km ) . On 20 April the CLR was shown to the press for the first time during a test session at the Hockenheimring in Germany . By that point in the development process the CLRs had covered 21 @,@ 735 mi ( 34 @,@ 979 km ) in testing without any major failures . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 The initial schedule for the CLRs consisted of participation in the May pre @-@ qualifying and testing session at Le Mans in preparation for the race in June . At the team 's Hockenheim test session plans were announced to enter several races after Le Mans . The first , scheduled for July , was to be an exhibition event consisting of two 60 mi ( 97 km ) races at the Norisring street circuit in Nuremberg , Germany . Mercedes planned to enter four CLRs in the event . The team would then end its season with the final three races of the American Le Mans Series : the 10 @-@ hour Petit Le Mans endurance at Road Atlanta and shorter races at Laguna Seca Raceway and Las Vegas Motor Speedway . More than 200 personnel from Mercedes @-@ Benz and HWA formed the crew for the three cars although the team was officially known as AMG @-@ Mercedes . 
 As part of its launch announcement in February 1999 , Mercedes named nine drivers to the team . Retained from the FIA GT programme were Christophe Bouchut , Jean @-@ Marc Gounon , Bernd Schneider , Marcel Tiemann , and Mark Webber . Nick Heidfeld , then a test driver for the McLaren Mercedes Formula One team , was added to the team for his first experience with sports cars . Former Macau Grand Prix winner and All @-@ Japan Formula Three champion Peter Dumbreck also came from an open wheel racing background . Pedro Lamy , 1998 FIA GT2 Champion , was drafted from the Oreca Chrysler team to participate at Le Mans and in the Deutsche <unk> Masters for Mercedes , while Franck Lagorce transferred from Nissan 's Le Mans squad . Darren Turner , also a test driver for McLaren , served as the team 's reserve driver for Le Mans .

 By winning the 1998 FIA GT Championship , Mercedes were awarded a single guaranteed entry for Le Mans , which was assigned to Gounon , Tiemann , and Webber in CLR No. 4 . Bouchut , Dumbreck , and Heidfeld in the No. 5 and Lagorce , Lamy , and Schneider in the No. 6 entries would have to pre @-@ qualify for the event , while No. 4 was free to use the pre @-@ qualifying session for testing purposes . Pre @-@ qualifying involved all 62 entry applicant teams setting lap times over a long session . The final entry for Le Mans would be made of 48 cars , combining guaranteed entries and the fastest cars in pre @-@ qualifying within their respective classes ; the prototype category , combining LMP and LMGTP cars , only allowed 28 cars from 31 entries . Competitors in the prototype category for 1999 included factory @-@ supported LMGTP programmes from Toyota and Audi , and LMP entries from Nissan , BMW , Audi , and Panoz . Toyota set the fastest pre @-@ qualifying time overall , followed by Panoz and BMW . Mercedes No. 6 was the sixth fastest car , while Nos. 4 and 5 were 14th and 15th respectively . Although the cars succeeded in passing pre @-@ qualifying , one CLR suffered a setback when a suspension linkage was torn from the front of the monocoque . The suspension failure was the first major fault suffered by the CLRs since their testing debut in February . 
 Several weeks after pre @-@ qualifying , Mercedes ' returned for two days of practice and qualifying sessions in the week leading up to the race . The sessions would set the starting grid for the race based on the fastest overall lap time by each car . At the end of the first day , Mercedes ' entries were fifth , sixth , and eighth on the provisional grid . Toyota led the session , over four seconds ahead of the fastest Mercedes . Early in the second day of sessions , Webber , driving CLR No. 4 , was following the Audi <unk> of Frank Biela through the portion of the circuit connecting Mulsanne Corner and the Indianapolis complex when he moved out of the Audi 's slipstream to overtake . The CLR suddenly lifted its nose and front wheels off the circuit and became airborne , flipping upwards and somersaulting backwards before rotating onto its side . The car impacted the tarmac with its right side while perpendicular to the circuit then flipped back onto its wheels before skidding 300 m ( 980 ft ) into the safety barriers on the side of the circuit . Webber was extracted from the car by track marshals and taken to a nearby hospital suffering from a sore neck , chest , and back . The accident occurred in an area not generally accessible to the public and was not seen by television cameras . 
 Due to the accident , the No. 4 car was unable to improve its qualifying time from the previous day , which relegated the car to tenth on the starting grid as competitors improved their times ; Mercedes No. 5 also did not improve its lap time and finished the session seventh . Bernd Schneider was able to go quicker than his time from the previous day with a 3 : 31 @.@ 541 lap for the No. 6 car . Toyota took pole position with a 3 : 29 @.@ 930 lap , while Schneider 's car was placed fourth on the final starting grid . The wreckage of the CLR No. 4 was returned to Mercedes at the end of the qualifying session and the team issued a press release confirming that they could repair the car before the start of the race two days later . A spare CLR monocoque , taken from a test car , was used to rebuild the No. 4 . Webber was able to recover from his injuries by spending the following day in physical training and was cleared on Saturday morning to participate in the race . 
 = = = Warm @-@ up = = = 
 On the morning of the race , a warm @-@ up session lasting half an hour was held as a final preparation for the teams . Mercedes No. 4 , repaired after its Thursday accident , joined its two teammates on the circuit as the session began . Webber was once again driving the No. 4 car as the trio made their way down the Mulsanne Straight . Approaching Mulsanne Corner , Webber trailed his two teammates but was approximately 15 m ( 50 ft ) behind a Chrysler Viper GTS @-@ R entered by Team Oreca . <unk> a hill at the approach to the corner , Webber 's car lifted its nose into the air once again and rose over 9 m ( 30 ft ) above the track , somersaulting backwards before twisting towards its right and hitting the tarmac with the right rear of the car while inverted , shedding its engine cover , rear wing , and nose . The car skidded on its roof into a run @-@ off area just short of the roundabout next to the Mulsanne Corner before coming to a halt . Marshals were eventually able to right the Mercedes and extract Webber , who sustained no major injuries . Television cameras located at Mulsannes Corner captured the aftermath of the accident and broadcast pictures of the CLR on its roof to the worldwide audience . Photographers in the same location also captured the car as it flipped . The ACO later published these photographs in its 1999 yearbook . 
 Mercedes immediately withdrew CLR No. 4 from the event as the race was only a few hours from beginning . Norbert Haug , head of Mercedes @-@ Benz 's motorsport activities , contacted Adrian Newey , chief aerodynamicist of the McLaren Formula One team , for consultation on modifying the remaining CLRs to prevent further accidents . The drivers were also consulted on whether they believed the cars were too dangerous to race ; Bouchut felt that the front of the car could become light at high speeds and voiced his concerns to the team , but other drivers had not felt this issue with the cars . Mercedes opted to make modifications to the front bodywork of the two remaining cars by adding dive planes to the fenders for increased downforce but sacrificing overall top speed . The drivers were also instructed not to follow other cars too closely . 
 = = = Race = = = 
 With only two CLRs remaining , Mercedes started from the fourth and seventh place grid positions . Schneider was able to move into third place behind the two Toyotas in the opening laps while Bouchut progressed to fourth . The Toyotas made pit stops first , followed by Schneider and Bouchut , then the two BMWs . One of the Toyotas eventually suffered transmission issues which dropped it down in the field , leaving the top six positions to be swapped amongst the two remaining Toyotas , two Mercedes , and two BMWs as they made pit stops on different schedules . Driver changes during later pit stops had Lagorce getting in the No. 6 to replace Schneider , while Dumbreck replaced Bouchut in the No. 5 . Schneider reported that , despite some initial problems dealing with the car 's new aerodynamics , it was running well by the end of his stint . 
 Towards the close of the fourth hour of the race , Dumbreck 's Mercedes came into contact with the GTS @-@ class Porsche 911 GT2 of the Estoril Racing team at the Ford Chicanes , but continued with no apparent damage . On lap 76 Dumbreck was in third place and catching Thierry <unk> 's Toyota in second place . The Mercedes and Toyota were nose to tail on the run from Mulsannes Corner to Indianapolis at nearly 200 mph ( 320 km / h ) with both drivers partially blinded by the setting sun ahead of them . At a slight right kink in the straight , Dumbreck 's CLR ran over the small apex <unk> and suddenly lifted its front wheels from the ground before somersaulting backwards as the entire car became airborne . The Mercedes rotated three times as it flew in the air , reaching a height of nearly 15 m ( 50 ft ) . The car continued its trajectory as the circuit curved to the right , clearing a marshaling post and the safety barrier on the left side of the track and missing a large advertising billboard bridging the track just ahead of it . Television cameras broadcasting the live world feed captured the CLR 's aerobatics before it went out of view behind trees . The car impacted the ground in an area of woods alongside the circuit that had been cut and cleared only two weeks prior and was inaccessible to spectators . The car dug a rut in the dirt as it continued to tumble in the clearing . The impact forced a tree limb to penetrate the monocoque between the driver 's seat and fuel tank . The CLR came to rest right side up and track marshals rushed to the stopped car . Track officials quickly slowed the race with caution flags and safety cars to dispatch recovery vehicles . Dumbreck was knocked unconscious after the initial impact but awoke and climbed from the car where he was found by the marshals and local Gendarmerie officers in the area . Dumbreck was later given a breathalyser test by the officers due to Le Mans ' use of public roads before being transported by ambulance to a local hospital for examinations before being released . At the end of the 76th lap Lagorce was ordered by the team to bring the remaining CLR directly to its garage ; upon the car 's arrival AMG @-@ Mercedes shut the last of its three garage doors signifying its official retirement from the event . National rivals BMW went on to win the race the following day . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Following the race the ACO and the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile ( FFSA ) national motorsport body investigated the incidents . The FFSA questioned the ACO 's decision to allow Mercedes to continue to compete after the two accidents prior to the race start , but the ACO argued that there were no indications that the problems that befell CLR No. 4 were shared by the other Mercedes entries . The ACO argued that the design of the CLR , with the longest front and rear overhang amongst the prototype field , was the cause of the problem . A Porsche 911 GT1 , similar in design to the CLR , had suffered a nearly identical accident the year before at Road Atlanta in the United States . The ACO changed the regulations for the LMGTP category in 2000 , decreasing the allowable length of overhang . The FIA also instructed its Advisory Expert Group to develop new regulations to prevent similar airborne accidents in other racing cars . The LMGTP class itself was abandoned by the teams in 2000 as Toyota cancelled its programme and Audi concentrated on open @-@ cockpit LMP cars ; the class reappeared in 2001 . 
 Peter Dumbreck , in response to his accident , initially blamed the height of the kerbs he had run on when his car became airborne , but Mercedes @-@ Benz responded by stating that blame did not lie with the circuit . The kerbs , as well as the entire Le Mans circuit , were all approved by the FIA . After the 2000 race the ACO and the French government did make modifications to the Route nationale 138 which forms the Mulsanne Straight , by decreasing the height of a hill by 7 @.@ 9 m ( 26 ft ) on the approach to the Mulsanne Corner where Webber had his warm @-@ up accident . 
 Before the race had concluded , Mercedes @-@ Benz addressed criticism from other drivers and teams of its decisions . Haug believed that the team 's data from Webber 's practice incident had been adequately analysed and that the drivers did not feel there were problems with their cars in traffic that could cause the same incidents , prompting his decision to continue . He also stated his belief that contact between CLR No. 5 and the Estoril Porsche may have damaged the front diffuser and led to the aerodynamic instabilities . Shortly after Le Mans Mercedes conducted its own examination of the accidents by running the remaining CLR on an airfield to verify wind tunnel data . Although no conclusions were published by Mercedes the company cancelled the rest of its 1999 programme , withdrawing from the Norisring exhibition event and the final three rounds of the American Le Mans Series . The team 's change in plans for the Norisring eventually led to the entire event being cancelled over a lack of manufacturer involvement . Mercedes returned to touring car racing from 2000 onwards , and has not participated at Le Mans in any capacity since 1999 . 
 Despite the failure of the CLR project , Christophe Bouchut felt that the cars were his favorite to drive in a 21 @-@ year career at Le Mans , praising the cars ' handling and technology . Following the damage to CLRs Nos. 4 and 5 during the Le Mans week , the remaining car has rarely been seen but has begun to make reappearances in recent years . As part of a 2008 celebration for the retirement of Bernd Schneider , CLR No. 6 was publicly displayed in Sankt <unk> , Germany . The car appeared in the hands of a private owner in 2009 at a Modena <unk> event held at the Nürburgring and was driven on the circuit . 
 The failures of the CLRs have become lore for Le Mans and motorsport in general . Speed Channel , as part of its tenth anniversary , named its broadcast of Dumbreck 's accident as the fourth most memorable moment in the network 's history . Road & Track magazine 's list of the ten most infamous crashes at Le Mans named Webber 's warm @-@ up accident as seventh and Dumbreck 's crash as second . 
 = Love in Motion ( Anika Moa album ) = 
 Love in Motion is the fourth studio album by New Zealand singer @-@ songwriter Anika Moa . The album 's underlying theme is love . Moa 's civil partner , Azaria Universe , was her biggest influence when writing the album . With Love in Motion , Moa moved from the folk and country pop influences of In Swings the Tide to a pop rock sound . The album was released by EMI Records internationally on 12 March 2010 , with releases in Moa 's home country and Australia following on 5 April and 10 September , respectively . Moa toured Westfield malls the week of the album 's release , and a concert tour followed in May and June 2010 . 
 Critical reviews for the album have been mostly positive , with Moa 's lyrical writing received well . It debuted and peaked on the New Zealand Albums Chart at number four . " Running Through the Fire ( Storm ) " served as the album 's lead single , which peaked at number thirty @-@ eight on the New Zealand Singles Chart . " Blame It on the Rain " , the second single , did not appear on any record chart . Love in Motion Covers was released in October 2011 ; it comprises covers of the songs from Love in Motion by other musicians . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 Moa has said that her partner , burlesque dancer Azaria Universe , with whom she entered into a civil union in February 2010 , was a major inspiration for the album . Love in Motion is dedicated to Universe , with the CD liner bearing the message , " For Azaria , let it be you , I fall into " . 
 When writing the album , Moa wanted to put the word " love " into the title of every song . Ultimately , four of the ten track titles contain " love " or " loves " , and every song has the word in its lyrics . In interviews , Moa has revealed the inspiration and circumstances around many of its songs . She said that " I Am the Woman Who Loves You " is about when she and Universe first met and that " Love Me Again " is about " taking the piss out of [ her ] love for Azaria " , calling the latter " a real Anika Moa song . " According to Moa , " Two Hearts " and " Secrets and Lies " were inspired by people who " fucked [ her ] off " . " Secrets and Lies " was written while Moa says she was " in a really bad mood " , however she asserts that it is her favourite track on the album . Moa said that " Blame It On the Rain " is about a person who Moa " will never ever name because they will be really , really sad if they knew " . " In the Air " is about Moa 's fear of flying , and " Running Through the Fire ( Storm ) " , originally simply called " Storm " , was prompted by the death of Moa 's father . 
 After interviewing Moa , The New Zealand Herald 's Scott Kara said that Love in Motion " is about love on all levels " . Moa described love as having " so many aspects to it . " She also said that " all of the songs are about love that 's true . " In an interview with <unk> Nissen from Newstalk ZB , Moa explained , " Most of the songs that I write are based on memories of my life or memories of someone who I know 's life " . She also mentioned that the album was influenced by many types of love ; not only her own , but also the love of her family , and love illustrated on soap operas such as Shortland Street and Grey 's Anatomy . 
 Moa wrote the songs for Love in Motion in two weeks , and it was recorded in two more weeks . Most of the album was written in Melbourne , while recording took place at three locations : Roundhead Studios , <unk> Studio and Radio New Zealand . Moa and Andre <unk> produced the album . 
 The writing and recording of Love in Motion was documented in the film In Bed With Anika Moa by filmmaker Justin Pemberton for the TVNZ documentary series <unk> . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Moa stated that " this is the first album that I really thought about what I wanted ... I wanted to keep [ the songs ] simple in structure , concentrating on the layering of vocals and guitars . " With Love in Motion , Moa moved away from her traditional pop and country pop sound to a pop rock environment . She intentionally changed the sound , through alterations in production and engineering , rather than the writing style . Moa told co @-@ producer Andre <unk> that she wanted the album to sound " dirty and gritty . " The album combines the genres of pop rock , " 80s pop " , bubblegum pop , and rock 'n'roll , as well as including both acoustic and electropop , and contains layered harmonies . Comparisons to the work of Ladyhawke , Sharon O 'Neill , Pat Benatar and Bic <unk> have been made . The sound of " I Am the Woman Who Loves You " , noted as a standout track by critics , was called " big but not overblown ... stylish and swooning " . 
 Lyrically , Love in Motion explores a wide variety of the main theme of love . The title track centres around " pure , unguarded joy " , and sexual innuendo exists during " Love Me Again " , while " Two Hearts " contains harsh lines and " Secrets and Lies " includes " don 't @-@ mess @-@ with @-@ me outpourings " . Various songs also examine conflict , and others , the loss of love .

 Love in Motion was released digitally by the Flightless Birds label internationally on 12 March 2010 . A New Zealand release followed on 5 April , by EMI Records , as both digital download and CD formats . During the week of the album 's release ( 6 – 10 April ) , Moa toured several Westfield shopping malls in Auckland , Hamilton , Wellington and Christchurch , playing for free to the public . In Australia , EMI released the album on 10 September 2010 . A special edition was released on 18 October 2010 , featuring a second disc of acoustic versions of each track on the album . Moa said that " I 've chosen to record an acoustic version of the album because I believe in the vulnerable , simplistic side of music and writing . The way you connect the songs the first time you hear it , no drums , no effects , no funky bass lines , just your voice and a guitar ... it feels like magic . "

 The lead single from Love in Motion , " Running Through the Fire ( Storm ) " , was released in New Zealand on 5 April 2010 , the same day as the album .

 A concert tour was held in various New Zealand cities in late May and early June 2010 . Chip Matthews , Geoff Maddock and Nick <unk> , who all played on the album , joined Moa on the tour . 
 Karyn <unk> of <unk> said " Moa wears her new musical influence well ... featuring less pop , less blues and less country influences , " and called the tour shows " a refreshing change . " The Timaru Herald 's Katarina Filipe praised Moa 's live performing nature , noting that " the radio and CD versions were nothing compared to her on @-@ stage performance " .

 Reviews for Love in Motion were mostly positive .

" The Nelson Mail 's Nick Ward praised the " slightly tough " album , putting it " up there with her best work . " Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald called the album " diverse and interesting , " and gave it four out of five stars . Amplifier 's Jo <unk> compared the work with that of Ladyhawke , and called it " different from her other work but ... her voice is still as tender and sweet as it ever was " . Simon Sweetman from North & South described the album as " an almost understated collection of love songs – possibly Moa 's strongest effort . " The Bay of Plenty Times ' Kristin MacFarlane said that " Anika Moa fans ... certainly won 't be disappointed " . Vicki Anderson of The Press complimented Moa 's lyrics , writing , " Whoever coined the phrase ' heart on sleeve ' must have had Moa in mind . " She concluded , " Love in Motion only serves to confirm my belief that Anika Moa is one of New Zealand 's best songwriters . " 
 However , Graham Reid from Elsewhere wrote that " it is ... a lot of very personal love being revealed and explored here and some will doubtless find that introspective nature and narrow wavelength less appealing than what has preceded it . " The Otago Daily Times ' Shane <unk> gave Love in Motion three stars , saying that Moa " ends up playing it a bit too safe . " James Thompson from the Waikato Times commended " the power of the lyrics " , but said that " regrettably , Love in Motion will not be ... a hugely successful album . " 
 Love in Motion won the Best Female Solo Artist award at the 2010 New Zealand Music Awards , beating Holy Smoke by Gin Wigmore and Humour and the Misfortune of Others by Hollie Smith .

 Route 77 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey . It runs 22 @.@ 55 mi ( 36 @.@ 29 km ) from an intersection with Route 49 in Bridgeton , Cumberland County north to a junction with Route 45 in Mullica Hill , Gloucester County . It is a mostly two @-@ lane , undivided road traversing through farmland in Cumberland , Salem , and Gloucester Counties . Along the way , Route 77 intersects Route 56 in Upper Deerfield Township and U.S. Route 40 ( US 40 ) in Upper Pittsgrove Township . 
 Prior to 1927 , the route was a branch of pre @-@ 1927 Route 6 that ran from Bridgeton to Mullica Hill . In 1927 , it was designated as Route 46 , which replaced the Bridgeton @-@ Mullica Hill branch of pre @-@ 1927 Route 6 . In 1953 , it was renumbered to Route 77 to avoid conflicting with US 46 in the northern part of the state . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Route 77 heads north from Route 49 and County Route 609 ( CR 609 ) in Bridgeton , Cumberland County on Pearl Street . In a short distance , the route intersects CR 670 and then crosses CR 552 , which ends a block to the west at Laurel Street . It continues north through residential areas of Bridgeton , meeting CR 665 and CR 659 . Route 77 heads into a commercial area , crossing into Upper Deerfield Township at the junction with Laurel Plaza Drive . The route intersects the western terminus of Route 56 and CR 622 , where the route is briefly a four @-@ lane road . Past this junction , Route 77 heads into farmland , where it encounters several county roads including CR 704 , CR 617 , and CR 658 . It heads north into Seabrook , where it meets CR 743 and CR 711 . Route 77 intersects CR 612 and CR 630 before crossing CR 540 in Deerfield . Past CR 540 , the route has junctions with CR 640 and CR 730 . Route 77 then encounters CR 614 , the last county route intersection in Cumberland County . 
 Route 77 crosses into Upper Pittsgrove Township , Salem County , where it becomes Pole Tavern @-@ Bridgeton Road , and crosses CR 611 in Shirley . It continues north through farms to Pole Tavern , where Route 77 meets US 40 , CR 604 , and CR 635 at the Pole Tavern Circle . Past the Pole Tavern Circle , the route becomes Bridgeton Pike and crosses CR 660 . Before leaving Salem County , Route 77 intersects two more county routes : CR 619 and CR 666 . 
 Route 77 crosses Oldmans Creek into Elk Township , Gloucester County , meeting CR 641 and CR 616 before crossing CR 538 . Past this junction , the route crosses CR 618 and enters Harrison Township . Route 77 continues northwest and enters Mullica Hill , where it intersects the northern terminus of CR 581 and heads north on South Main Street . Route 77 ends at Route 45 , where Route 45 continues to the north on South Main Street .

 = Summit Series = 
 The Summit Series , or Super Series ( in Russian <unk> СССР — <unk> ) , known at the time simply as the Canada – USSR Series , was an eight @-@ game series of ice hockey between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Canada , held in September 1972 . It was the first competition between the Soviet national team and a Canadian team represented by professional players of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) , known as Team Canada . It was the first international ice hockey competition for Canada after Canada had withdrawn from international ice hockey competitions in a dispute with the International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) . The series was organized with the intention to create a true best @-@ on @-@ best competition in the sport of ice hockey . The Soviets had become the dominant team in international competitions , which disallowed the professional players of Canada . Canada had had a long history of dominance of the sport prior to the Soviets ' rise . 
 The first four games of the series were held in Canada and the final four in Moscow . The Soviet Union surprised the Canadian team and most of the hockey media with an opening game victory , 7 – 3 . Many sportswriters had predicted an overwhelming victory for Canada in the series . Canada won the next game 4 – 1 ; the third game was a tie and the Soviets won game four to take a two games to one lead after the Canadian segment . The series resumed two weeks later in Moscow . The Soviets won game five to take a three games to one series lead . The Canadians won the final three games in Moscow to win the series four games to three , with one tie . The final game was won in dramatic fashion , with the Canadians overcoming a two @-@ goal Soviet lead after two periods . The Canadians scored three in the third , the final one scored with 34 seconds left , by Paul Henderson . 
 The series was played during the Cold War , and intense feelings of nationalism were aroused in both Canada and the Soviet Union , as well as on the ice . The games introduced several talented Soviet players to North America , such as Alexander Yakushev , Valeri Kharlamov and goaltender Vladislav Tretiak , a future Hall of Fame inductee . Team Canada , the first NHL and professional all @-@ star team formed for international play , was led by Phil Esposito , who led the series in scoring , as well as contributing in other roles . The Canadian line of Bobby Clarke , Ron Ellis and Henderson , which was not expected to start for the team , as none were yet stars , played a surprisingly large role in the Canadian win . The series was filled with controversy , starting with the exclusion of top Canadian player Bobby Hull and including disputes over officiating , dirty play on the part of both teams and the deliberate injury of Kharlamov by Clarke in game six .

 From the beginning of the IIHF World Championships in 1920 , Canada would send a senior amateur club team , usually the previous year 's Allan Cup champion , to compete as the Canadian entry . These teams were often university players , or unpaid players playing ice hockey while being employed in some other profession full @-@ time . From the 1920s until the 1950s , Canadian amateur club teams won most of the World Championship and Olympic titles . As a career , Canadian players would play instead in the various professional hockey leagues , the best reaching the NHL . Their professional status made them ineligible to play in the World Championships or Olympics under the rules of the time . The last Canadian amateur club to win the world championship was the Trail Smoke Eaters in 1961 . 
 In the earliest days of the Soviet Union , bandy or " Russian hockey " was played , not " Canadian hockey " , and the Soviets did not compete in the Olympics or World Championships , which played the Canadian game . Post @-@ World War II , a goal of the Central Committee of the Soviet Union was world supremacy in sport . The decision was made to transfer resources to the Canadian game . Starting in the 1940s , the Soviet Union started a Soviet hockey league playing the Canadian game . The elite sports societies of the Soviet Union , such as Central Sports Club Army , Dynamo and Spartak , soon became the elite teams of the hockey league and supplied the players for the national team . Ostensibly amateurs , the players played hockey full @-@ time , paid by the government . The players had other titular professions ; for example Moscow Dynamo players became officers of the KGB ; CSKA Moscow players became officers in the army . This preserved a player 's amateur status for Olympic and World Championship eligibility and the players would have a career after their hockey playing days ended . 
 Entering international play in 1954 , the Soviet national team under the tutelage of Anatoli Tarasov started to dominate the international competitions , and won nine consecutive championships in the 1960s . Canada , in response , developed a national team of its own . But Canada 's best players usually became professionals and the national team featured mostly university players . The Canadian team did not win any championships and was looked upon as a failure . By 1969 , the Government of Canada had formed Hockey Canada , an organization to co @-@ ordinate Canadian international play with its amateur organizations and the NHL . In July 1969 , on a trial basis , the inclusion of nine professional players for any event for one year was agreed to by the IIHF . Canada entered a team with five professionals in the Izvestia tournament at Christmas in 1969 , and nearly won the tournament . The IIHF then convened an emergency meeting in January 1970 , and the rule allowing professionals was rescinded . In response , Canada withdrew from IIHF play . The 1970 IIHF World Championships , scheduled to be held in Canada for the first time , were transferred to Sweden after Canada refused to host the event . 
 = = Organization = = 
 The Canadian embassy in Moscow learned of the Soviets ' interest in a series initially through reading an article in the Soviet Izvestia newspaper in the winter of 1971 – 1972 . Diplomat Gary Smith , responsible for sport and cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union , read that the Soviets were looking for a new challenge in ice hockey . Smith met with Izvestia sports editor Boris <unk> initially , then followed up with a meeting with Soviet hockey boss Andrei Starovoitov . The Soviets divulged that they were ready to play in a series between its national team and Canadian professionals . After the meetings , Canadian ambassador Robert Ford passed the matter to Ottawa to negotiate a series and Hockey Canada was given the task to nail down the terms for a series . 
 Hockey Canada and the Soviet Hockey Federation met in Prague in April 1972 during the IIHF World Ice Hockey Championships . The two sides agreed on the terms : four games in Canada , to be held in Montreal ( Montreal Forum ) , Toronto ( Maple Leaf Gardens ) , Winnipeg ( Winnipeg Arena ) , and Vancouver ( Pacific Coliseum ) and four games in the Soviet Union , all of them to be held in Moscow at the Luzhniki Ice Palace . The Canadians agreed to hold the series in September and play the games under international rules . The Canadians agreed to IIHF amateur referees in the Canada part of the series , and European referees in the Moscow games . The refereeing would use the international two referee system , not the one referee , two linemen system in place in the NHL , and , at the time , being introduced into international play . The Canadian side agreed to the terms under the belief that the Canadians would have no difficulty winning under any set of conditions . Joe <unk> , president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association ( CAHA ) , who was present at the negotiations , felt however , that the Soviets had demanded the concessions for their own benefit , believing that their team was already equal to any NHL team . The NHL later requested dates in October or November but the idea was abandoned . 
 NHL players ' union president and Hockey Canada director Alan Eagleson , while not involved in the initial negotiations , became a central figure in the organization of the series . Eagleson , who could call on a personal network of players , NHL owners , Hockey Canada executives and Canadian business , would be involved in most arrangements for the Canadian team . Eagleson would confide to Toronto Star reporter Alexander Ross , that he " un @-@ negotiated " much of what had been negotiated between the governments . Eagleson placated the NHL owners by arranging that part of the series ' proceeds would go to the NHL player 's pension fund , reducing payments from the owners , and threatening to have his player clients play without NHL co @-@ operation . Before the first game , Eagleson personally paid to settle a lawsuit won by a Montreal man , whose car had been destroyed in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia . The court had ordered the Soviet team 's hockey equipment seized to guarantee payment , threatening the start of the series . 
 Former Boston Bruins ' coach Harry Sinden , who had been out of hockey since leaving the Bruins in 1970 , was suggested by the media as a good candidate for the job of Team Canada 's coach . Ron Brown , a sportswriter from Kingston , Ontario called Sinden and in the interview , Sinden admitted that he was available and willing to take the position . After a phone call from Sinden to Alan Eagleson , it was arranged for Sinden to have an interview with Hockey Canada 's steering committee for the series in June . After the one interview , Hockey Canada selected Sinden for the position . Sinden selected former player John Ferguson as his assistant coach , after initially trying to recruit Ferguson as a player . 
 The Soviets selected Vsevolod Bobrov as the coach for the series . Bobrov was a former player who had played against Team Canada in the 1950s and later managed the Soviet national soccer team and the Moscow Spartak ice hockey team . Bobrov had been given the job as the Soviets ' national ice hockey team coach , replacing long @-@ time coach Anatoli Tarasov after the 1972 Winter Olympics . This was his second international assignment ; his first was the 1972 World Championship , where Czechoslovakia had defeated the Soviet Union , ending a run of nine consecutive championships by the Soviets . 
 The Canadian team would be known as Team Canada for the first time . The name and sweater design was done by advertising agency Vickers and Benson . Eagleson wanted to call the team the " NHL All @-@ Stars " , but the agency convinced Eagleson otherwise , as the teams were from the USSR and Canada . The name Team Canada was inspired by the contemporary auto @-@ racing team Team McLaren . The name is attributed to copy writer Terry Hill , whose first choice " The Dream Team " was rejected . The design of the sweater by designer John Lloyd utilized an enormous stylized maple leaf , like the Canadian flag , that covers the front . No numbers were on the sleeves , only on the back with the wording " CANADA " above the number . The sweater used only two colours : red and white , the maple leaf , numbers and letters in one colour and the rest of the sweater the other . The name , sweater design and a team song were all prepared in 24 hours , in time for a previously scheduled news conference . The series itself was simply known at the time as the Canada @-@ USSR Series , although the name " Friendship Series " had been suggested by the Government of Canada Ministry of Foreign Affairs . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 Along with coaching , Harry Sinden was given the task of selecting Team Canada , which would be the first true " team " composed of NHL all @-@ stars . When Sinden announced the list of 35 Canadian players on July 12 , one of the conditions of playing was revealed ; that players would have to have a signed NHL contract by August 13 . His list of players included Bobby Hull , who by that time had already signed with the rival World Hockey Association ( WHA ) league . Three other players Sinden named : Gerry Cheevers , Derek Sanderson and J. C. Tremblay had not yet signed with the WHA , but would do so and become ineligible . The condition had been negotiated between the NHL and Hockey Canada , and the NHL would not relent . The condition was widely criticized , including by the NHL 's own Harold Ballard , the Toronto Maple Leafs owner and a harsh opponent of the WHA . Ballard felt that the series was the " unofficial world series of hockey and we want to win " . Phil Reimer , a governor of Hockey Canada , resigned over the matter . Prime Minister Trudeau made a personal appeal , but Doug Fisher , chairman of Hockey Canada refused to re @-@ open the agreement between the NHL and Hockey Canada . 
 Prior to training camp , there were several changes in the roster . Jacques Laperriere withdrew and Guy Lapointe was selected as his replacement . Dennis Hull , brother of Bobby , considered turning down his invitation , but accepted because Bobby wished him to . Cheevers was replaced by his Boston team @-@ mate Eddie Johnston . Stan Mikita replaced Sanderson . Rick Martin replaced Bobby Hull . Bobby Orr , who was selected to the team although he was injured , remained with the team during the series and practiced with the team , but did not play in any games . 
 Team Canada assembled in Toronto and started training camp on August 13 . Sinden named four co @-@ captains : Phil Esposito , Frank Mahovlich , Stan Mikita and Jean Ratelle . The team trained for three weeks in Toronto , and arrived in Montreal on August 31 for the first game . The team held a practice on September 1 at the Forum . The unheralded line of Bobby Clarke , Ron Ellis and Paul Henderson impressed in camp , enough to earn a place in the starting lineup for game one . 
 The Soviets named 31 players for its roster on August 11 . The roster included four goaltenders led by 20 @-@ year @-@ old Vladislav Tretiak , Olympic and two @-@ time world champion . The defence was led by Alexander <unk> , who had played in three Olympics and nine world championships . The team was a veteran team with only a handful of players to make their national team debut . Several players were named provisionally , depending on their performance in the Sovietsky Sport tournament being held during August . Boris Kulagin , coach of <unk> <unk> , was named the assistant coach . Among the forwards , the team did not name Anatoli Firsov , regarded as the " Bobby Hull " of the Soviets , who had reportedly spoken out against his new coach . Most of the players named were from the Soviet " Red Army " team HC CSKA Moscow , the team managed by former national coach Tarasov . 
 Along with their regular training , Bobrov had the Soviet players take boxing lessons in preparation for the series . The Soviets arrived in Montreal not long before the series , on August 30 . Staying at Montreal 's Queen Elizabeth Hotel , the team began two @-@ a @-@ day workouts at the St. Laurent Arena the next day . They were already acclimatized to the time zone as the team had been training on Montreal time for two weeks before travelling there . They brought 15 forwards , nine defencemen and three goaltenders . Veteran defenceman Vitaly Davydov did not accompany the team to Canada . The reason given was injury , but the media questioned if Davydov had fallen out of favour with Bobrov . Firsov was reported as having a knee injury to explain his omission from the team . 
 During the pre @-@ series period , two observers of the opposing team were allowed to scout the teams . Toronto Maple Leafs ' coach John McLellan and Bob Davidson , the Leafs ' head scout went to Russia to observe the Soviets in the Sovietsky Sport tournament . McLellan and Davidson observed two games , while Kulagin , along with <unk> <unk> , a former assistant to Tarasov , observed all of the Canadians ' practices in Toronto . 
 While the Russian team was in Canada , Rick Noonan , a trainer for the University of British Columbia ’ s sports teams , was assigned by Hockey Canada to assist the Soviets . Noonan , who would be later be named general manager of Team Canada for the 1980 Winter Olympics , was the only Canadian to have regular access to the Soviet 's locker room , and he was behind the Soviet 's bench during the first four games of the Summit Series .

 At the time , the National Hockey League was considered to be where the best hockey players played , and its best players consisted largely of Canadians . The public consensus of hockey pundits and fans in North America was that other countries , the Soviets in this case , were simply no match for Canada 's best . The Soviets were not expected to even give the Canadians a challenge , and Canada was going into this series expected to win handily . According to Team Canada Coach Harry Sinden : " Canada is first in the world in two things : hockey and wheat . " Alan Eagleson said " We gotta win in eight games . Anything less than an unblemished sweep of the Russians would bring shame down on the heads of the players and the national pride . " The Soviets downplayed themselves , stating that they were in the series to learn . 
 In a poll of experts conducted by The Hockey News , not one expected the Soviets to win a single game . Journalist Dick Beddoes of Toronto 's The Globe and Mail offered to eat his words " shredded at high noon in a bowl of borscht on the steps of the Russian Embassy " if the Soviets won one game . Canadian journalists Milt <unk> ( Toronto Star ) , Jim Coleman ( Southam ) and Claude <unk> ( Le Soleil ) predicted results of seven wins to one for the Soviets . American journalists Gerald Eskenazi ( New York Times ) and Fran Rosa ( Boston Globe ) predicted eight wins to none , while Mark Mulvoy ( Sports Illustrated ) predicted seven wins to one for Canada . 
 Before the first game , former Canadiens ' star goaltender Jacques Plante gave Soviet goaltender Tretiak advice on how to play the NHL forwards . Plante did this because he was " thinking of the humiliation he was almost certain to suffer . " Plante himself predicted Canada would win " eight straight . " In a game scouted by Team Canada , Tretiak had given up eight goals , in a game played the day before his wedding . 
 A few Canadians gave a dissenting prognosis of the series . John Robertson of the Montreal Star warned that Team Canada was too poorly prepared and out of shape to win the series . He blamed the NHL : " This , the most important hockey event of our time , has been tacked onto the front of the NHL season as something only tolerated by the owners , and endorsed by the players as a means of enriching their pension plan . " Former professional player Billy Harris who had coached Sweden 's national team earlier in the year , predicted a Soviets ' win , largely on the strength of Tretiak 's goaltending . 
 Prior to the series , Bobrov held a press luncheon in Moscow . He refused to consider that either team would sweep the series . To him , Team Canada had " the fire power , know @-@ how and goaltending " , but how would it adapt to international rules , two @-@ referee system and amateur officials ? He conceded that Phil Esposito would " be difficult to move from the front of the net . I expect there will be some surprises for us when we meet your Canadian stars . " He also predicted that Valeri Kharlamov " will stand out , even against your best Canadians . By North American standards , he is small but he has an excellent shot . I think he will be effective . " Sinden was aware of Kharlamov and he selected Ron Ellis to the Team Canada roster especially to cover Kharlamov .

 = = = Game one = = = 
 Game one was held in Montreal in a very warm Montreal Forum on September 2 before 18 @,@ 818 fans . The gamesmanship between the teams started before the first faceoff . Canada was assigned the home team for all games in Canada , while the Soviets would be the home team in Moscow . The Soviets would not release their lineup until they had seen their opponents ' , the opposite order , considering they were the visitors . The official scorer had to return to the Soviets ' dressing room and demand the lineup . To Sinden , he wanted to put the Ellis @-@ Clarke @-@ Henderson line on against Valeri Kharlamov 's line . The Soviets did not start Kharlamov 's line and Sinden named Phil Esposito 's line for the opening face @-@ off . 
 The move paid off as Phil Esposito scored for Canada after just 30 seconds of play , knocking a puck out of the air behind the Soviets ' goaltender Vladislav Tretiak . But even after a few minutes , Sinden felt the Soviets were coming on and having no difficulty getting through Canada 's defence . Henderson scored after six minutes to give Canada a two @-@ goal lead on a face @-@ off win by Clarke , the only advantage that Team Canada had , in Sinden 's estimation . To Canadian spectators and the media , the second goal gave the appearance that the pre series predictions of a rout had been proven correct . But the Soviets got over any awe of the NHLers and scored two goals to tie the score before the end of the first period . Yevgeni Zimin scored on a pass from behind the net , and Vladimir Petrov scored a short @-@ handed goal on a Soviet two @-@ on @-@ one break , with Petrov potting the rebound . According to Sinden , the Canadian players had lost their poise , " running all over the ice " to establish their hitting game , while the Soviets used an unexpected tactic , that of the long pass , to break a man out of their defensive zone . The Canadian defence was also dropping to the ice to block shots , while the Soviets only skated around the defence to get a good shot . Although Tretiak had given up the two Canada goals on the first two shots , he recovered later in the period to make a couple of critical saves off Esposito at point @-@ blank range . According to Esposito , " at Christmas time , it would have been 4 – 0 for us . " 
 In the second period , Kharlamov scored on a great individual effort to put the Soviets ahead . Kharlamov deked Don Awrey , skated around him , faked a back @-@ hand shot on Dryden , but scored on the fore @-@ hand . Kharlamov then scored a second goal to give the Soviets a two @-@ goal lead at the end of the second period . During the period , the air temperature in the Forum increased . By the end of the second period , the temperature in the Forum had reached 115 ° F ( 46 ° C ) . 
 Sinden made changes for the third period . He benched Awrey and the Jean Ratelle line , going with three lines . In the third , Clarke scored to bring Canada within one . The Canadians attempted to get the equalizer , and Yvan Cournoyer put a puck off the post , but the Soviets broke out afterwards and Boris Mikhailov scored on the counter @-@ attack to restore the two @-@ goal lead with six minutes to play . Mikhailov skated across the Canadian net about 20 feet out , lured Dryden away from the net , then back @-@ handed the puck into the net between his legs . The strategy of three lines , combined with the heat in the arena , had left the Canadians exhausted by then and the Soviets scored twice in the final minutes to finish with a 7 – 3 victory . 
 " I was stunned by their performance " was Sinden 's assessment . Former Montreal Canadiens ' coach Claude Ruel commented that the Soviets ' forwards were one of the most finely honed units he had ever seen . " They are always moving , never standing around , they head @-@ man the puck as well as anyone has ever done — and they always seem to be in the right place . " According to Canada 's goaltender Ken Dryden : " We didn 't play our game at all . After they tied it up , we started playing a panic type of game . Sometimes there were five men going for the puck at once . " At the end of the game , Team Canada accidentally snubbed the Soviets by returning to the dressing room directly without shaking hands with the Soviets after the game . 
 The win by the Soviets was celebrated into the early hours back home , and many took the next day off work . Valeri Kharlamov 's father Boris held an impromptu party at his Moscow apartment . 
 = = = Game two = = = 
 The second game was played at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto . Sinden sat out several players from the first game , including Don Awrey , Red Berenson , Ken Dryden , Rod Gilbert , Vic Hadfield , Jean Ratelle , Mickey Redmond and Rod Seiling . Hadfield took the benching hard , as he was from the Toronto area and felt he was being embarrassed in front of his home town . On defence , Serge Savard , Pat Stapleton and Bill White were added . On offence , Stan Mikita , Wayne Cashman and J. P. Parise were added . Tony Esposito took over goaltending duties . Sinden 's changes were to get " the diggers into the game and try to grind the Russians down . We had went for speed and quickness in our first lineup , yet the Russians were still faster and quicker . " 
 Team Canada responded to their previous defeat with strong play in this game . The first period was scoreless , but the Canadians used the period to intimidate the Soviets with hard body checking , especially from Cashman , Bergman , Peter Mahovlich and Parise , to throw the Soviets off their game . In the second period , the first goal of the match was again scored by Esposito , this time from a feed from his regular Bruins ' linemate Cashman , who had retrieved the puck deep in the Soviets ' zone after colliding with the Soviets ' defenceman Vladimir <unk> . In the third period , Yvan Cournoyer wheeled around Alexander <unk> and beat Tretiak . Yakushev got the Soviets on the board after team @-@ mate Yevgeni Zimin missed on a break @-@ away . <unk> pounced on the rebound and fed it out front for Yakushev to bury the puck behind Esposito . Peter Mahovlich then scored a critical goal while Canada was short @-@ handed , <unk> out the Soviet defender one @-@ on @-@ one , then Tretiak , to give Canada a two @-@ goal lead . His brother Frank then finished the scoring on a feed from Mikita , who had circled around a Soviets ' defenceman . Team Canada won the game 4 – 1 and tied the series . 
 The Soviet coaches blamed the loss on the refereeing . Bobrov complained that the pair of American referees , Frank Larsen and Steve Dowling , let the Canadians get away with everything . After the game , the head of the USSR Hockey Federation , Andrei Starovoitov , charged the door of the officials ' dressing room and kicked chairs over . The pair of referees , scheduled to referee game four in Vancouver , were replaced by the pair who had refereed game one and game three , Gord Lee and Len Gagnon . Team Canada agreed to the request by the Soviets to change referees , apparently not aware of Starovoitov 's tantrum after game two . 
 = = = Game three = = = 
 Game three was held in Winnipeg on September 6 . After the second game , the Soviets said that they had strayed into playing too much of the Canadian style , as individuals , and promised to return to their team style for the third game . Canada went with the same lineup as game two , with the exception of Ratelle replacing Bill Goldsworthy . Team Canada held leads of 3 – 1 and 4 – 2 , but the Soviet side responded and the game ended in a 4 – 4 tie . 
 Canada took the lead only 1 : 54 into the game on a goal by J. P. Parise , but Petrov replied short @-@ handed at 3 : 16 to tie the game . Petrov stole the puck from Frank Mahovlich and broke away and deked Tony Esposito to score . After a strong fore @-@ check by the Canadians on the Soviets in their zone , Ratelle scored to put Canada ahead 2 – 1 after the first . Wayne Cashman dug the puck out of a scrum in the corner to feed the puck to Phil Esposito who scored to put Canada ahead 3 – 1 . On another Canadian power play , Kharlamov was circling behind the Canadian defence and received a pass to put himself on a breakaway . Kharlamov deked Tony Esposito to score the Soviets ' second short @-@ handed goal . Paul Henderson scored seconds later to restore the two @-@ goal lead , on an individual effort . The Soviets ' " <unk> 's Line " of Yuri Lebedev , Vyacheslav <unk> and Alexander <unk> then scored two goals to tie the game at 4 – 4 after two periods . 
 Team Canada assistant coach Ferguson felt that the Canadians had gotten over @-@ confident . " I was fooled again . I felt that after we had taken a 3 – 1 lead , the final score might be something like 7 – 1 . But those two short @-@ handed goals . When you score one short @-@ handed goal it can turn it all around . But two ? That 's almost fatal . " According to Tim Burke of the Montreal Gazette , both goaltenders , Tony Esposito and Vladislav Tretiak , reached great heights , or the outcome could have been 10 – 10 . Tretiak was making an unexpected start for the Soviets . The Soviets had planned to start Viktor Zinger , but he was reported to be ill before the game . The Soviets coach Bobrov complained about the refereeing and the play of Wayne Cashman , stating that " if that game had been played in Europe , he would have spent the whole game in the penalty box . " 
 = = = Game four = = = 
 Game four was played in Vancouver . Team Canada was surprised to find that the crowd booed Canada during the warm @-@ up and cheered louder for the Soviets during the game 's introduction . The game started with two consecutive penalties by Bill Goldsworthy and Boris Mikhailov scored power play goals on both penalties to give the Soviets a 2 – 0 lead . Goldsworthy , who had started in place of Wayne Cashman , wanted to replace Cashman 's truculence , but only hurt his team and was criticized privately by Sinden . In the second , Gilbert Perreault scored on a Soviet own @-@ goal to get Canada within one goal , but Blinov scored less than a minute later to restore the two @-@ goal lead . Rod Gilbert scored a questionable goal that was disallowed and Canada 's protests went unheeded . To Sinden , that was the turning point of the game , and the result could have been different had the goal been allowed , although Sinden admitted that it was " a beating . " <unk> scored to put the Soviets ahead 4 – 1 after two periods . In the third , Goldsworthy made partial amends to get Canada to 4 – 2 , but <unk> scored to put the game out of reach . Dennis Hull scored in the final minute to make it closer , but it was too late . 
 Sinden had changed the lineup and the Canadian goals were all scored by players Sinden had inserted in place of players who had played in Winnipeg . Still , Sinden felt that changing the lineup had been a mistake . According to Sinden , Ken Dryden , who had replaced Tony Esposito , did not have a good game ; he was shaky and Tretiak was great . According to Conacher , the Soviets used cross @-@ ice passing in the attacking zone , a tactic that caused problems for Dryden . Serge Savard missed the game after fracturing his ankle in practice . 
 Team Canada was booed off the ice at game 's end . Responding to the negative public and media reaction in light of the expectation for an overwhelming Team Canada sweep of the series , Phil Esposito made an emotional outburst in a post @-@ game interview : 
 Brad Park and Frank Mahovlich also criticized the booing . According to Park : " We get nothing — not a dime for this . Brother , I 'm sick " . Other players were more sanguine . Dryden didn 't lash out at the fans . " I 'm disappointed , but I can understand it . The fans wanted us to do real good , and they 're frustrated we didn 't . I didn 't think I deserved to be booed . Tretiak frustrated us , but I guess I didn 't frustrate them enough . "
