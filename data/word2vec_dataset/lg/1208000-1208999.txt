 Football resumed after the war for the 1919 – 20 season and Villa won their sixth FA Cup at the end of season , beating Huddersfield Town 1 – 0 at Stamford Bridge . In November 1923 , Villa 's centre @-@ half Tommy Ball was killed by his neighbour , thus becoming the only active Football League player to have been murdered . In their Golden Jubilee season of 1923 – 24 , Villa got through to the second final to be held at the then new Wembley Stadium , where they lost 2 – 0 to Newcastle United . This Cup final was to be something of a pinnacle though as Villa then had League finishes of sixth and tenth in the following seasons . The Directors attempted to stop the slump with transfer dealings . In 1927 , they bought both Jimmy Gibson and Eric Houghton . In 1928 , they bought in one of the most prolific goalscorers to have ever played in the English football league . When Villa signed Tranmere Rovers striker Tom Waring for £ 4 @,@ 700 , he was relatively unknown . Waring scored a record 49 league goals in the 1930 – 31 season as Villa finished runners @-@ up to Arsenal . One of the other purchases , Eric Houghton , scored 30 goals . 
 The team were playing well and scoring many goals . In the 1933 – 34 season , Villa had no fewer than fourteen full internationals and they continued to challenge for honours being second in the League in 1933 . Yet this success did not last and the complacency at Villa Park led to a slump in form . This slump culminated in their relegation from the first tier of English football for the first time in their history in the 1935 – 36 season . The relegation coincided with the decision to appoint their first manager . Before the 1935 – 36 season , the team had been appointed by a committee and the team was coached by a " secretary " to the committee . The relegation though was largely due a dismal defensive record , they conceded 110 goals , 7 of them coming from Arsenal 's Ted Drake in an 1 – 7 defeat at Villa Park . Villa came ninth in their first season in the Second tier of English football but they were crowned Second Division Champions in 1937 – 38 under the guidance of Jimmy Hogan . By the outbreak of the Second World War , Aston Villa were back in the top @-@ flight of English football . 
 Their Aston Villa reserves ( or seconds ) team enlisted in the army and were captured at the Dunkirk evacuation in June 1940 . In December in an Eastern German camp , a German Guard regiment challenged British prisoners of war to a game of football ; the guards were being defeated 27 @-@ 0 when they stopped the game , only then learning these prisoners were Aston Villa 's second team . 
 = = Post @-@ war rebuilding = = 
 For Villa , as with all English clubs , the Second World War brought about the loss of seven seasons , and several careers were brought to a premature end by the conflict . The first game played at Villa Park after the cessation of hostilities was against Middlesbrough and Villa lost 1 – 0 in front of a crowd of 50 @,@ 000 . Aston Villa went about rebuilding the team , under the guidance of former player Alex Massie for the remainder of the 1940s . Massie made some bold signings in his time with the club , the first of which was 23 @-@ year @-@ old Wales international Trevor Ford , who was bought from Swansea for £ 9 @,@ 500 in 1946 , when Villa finished eighth in the League . Ford would go on to score 60 times in his four seasons at Villa Park , before he was sold in the 1950 – 51 season to Sunderland for a then British record of £ 30 @,@ 000 ( £ 900 @,@ 000 today ) . 
 For the remainder of the 1940s and early 1950s , Massie continued to bring in new players whilst the team regularly had mid @-@ table finishes . One of the more influential signings was Danny Blanchflower in 1951 for £ 15 @,@ 000 . Villa had a good start to the 1951 – 52 season when , after eight games , Villa were second behind Manchester United . This was their best start of the last 19 years , and they eventually finished in sixth place . After a mid @-@ table finish in the 1952 – 53 season , the following season , saw the return of Eric Houghton , this time in a managerial capacity . One of his first actions was to introduce 19 – year – old Peter McParland to the first team . His first season in charge ended with Villa in 13th place . Nevertheless , " Houghton had done well to guide a transitional Villa team to a respectable position in the top flight . " Under Houghton 's stewardship , Villa won the 1957 FA Cup Final against Manchester United 's celebrated Busby Babes . Peter McParland scored both goals in a 2 – 1 victory , in a record @-@ equalling ninth FA Cup final . It was Aston Villa 's first trophy for 37 years . 
 = = Fluctuating fortunes = = 
 The success of the previous season proved to be something of a false dawn though , with the team finishing 14th , seven points above relegation . After refusing to resign , Eric Houghton was sacked when relegation seemed imminent in 1958 – 59 . His successor Joe Mercer was unable to prevent the club being relegated in 1959 , for only the second time in its history . The fact that Villa reached the semi @-@ finals of the FA Cup only served to highlight the complacency that had set in at the club that led to Villa being relegated . Villa only spent one season in the Second Division , returning as Champions in 1960 . The 1960 – 61 season was a successful one ; it saw Villa reach the semi @-@ finals of the FA Cup , finish ninth in the League , and win the inaugural League Cup . This was helped by the emergence of an exciting group of youth players , who became known as " Mercer 's Minors " . 
 = WALL @-@ E = 
 WALL @-@ E ( stylized with an <unk> as WALL · E ) is a 2008 American computer @-@ animated science @-@ fiction comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures . Directed by Andrew Stanton , the story follows a robot named WALL @-@ E , who is designed to clean up an abandoned , waste @-@ covered Earth far in the future . He falls in love with another robot named EVE , who also has a programmed task , and follows her into outer space on an adventure that changes the destiny of both his kind and humanity . Both robots exhibit an appearance of free will and emotions similar to humans , which develop further as the film progresses . 
 After directing Finding Nemo , Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space . WALL @-@ E has minimal dialogue in its early sequences ; many of the characters do not have voices , but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds , which were designed by Ben Burtt . It is also Pixar 's first animated feature with segments featuring live @-@ action characters . 
 WALL @-@ E was released in the United States and Canada on June 27 , 2008 . It grossed $ 23 @.@ 2 million on its opening day , and $ 63 @.@ 1 million during its opening weekend in 3 @,@ 992 theaters , ranking number one at the box office . This ranks as the fifth highest @-@ grossing opening weekend for a Pixar film . Following Pixar tradition , WALL @-@ E was paired with a short film , Presto , for its theatrical release . 
 WALL @-@ E was met with critical acclaim , scoring an approval rating of 96 % on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes . It grossed $ 521 @.@ 3 million worldwide , won the 2008 Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film , the 2009 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Long Form , the final Nebula Award for Best Script , the Saturn Award for Best Animated Film , and the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature as well as being nominated for five other Academy Awards at the 81st Academy Awards . WALL @-@ E ranks first in TIME 's " Best Movies of the Decade " . The film is seen as a critique on larger societal issues . It addresses consumerism , corporatism , nostalgia , environmental problems , waste management , human impact on the environment , and risks to human civilization and the planet Earth . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In <unk> , Earth is abandoned and covered in heaps of garbage left over from decades of mass consumerism facilitated by the megacorporation Buy ' n ' Large ( BnL ) . Seven hundred years earlier , BnL evacuated Earth 's population in fully automated <unk> , leaving behind WALL @-@ E trash compactor robots to clean the planet for humanity 's eventual return . The plan failed , however , and all WALL @-@ E units are now inactive except one , which has developed sentience after decades of life experience . He manages to remain in operation by repairing himself using parts from other inactive units . 
 One day , WALL @-@ E discovers a growing seedling . Later , a spaceship lands and deploys EVE , an advanced robot probe sent from the BnL starliner Axiom to search for vegetation on Earth . WALL @-@ E falls in love with the initially cold and hostile EVE , who gradually softens and befriends him . When WALL @-@ E brings EVE to his home and shows her his collection , she sees the plant , automatically stores it inside herself , and goes into standby mode waiting for her ship to retrieve her . WALL @-@ E , confused why EVE seems to have shut down , tries numerous methods to reactivate her . When EVE 's ship returns and collects EVE , WALL @-@ E clings to its hull and thus travels through space to the Axiom , which is hidden behind a nebula . 
 On the Axiom , the descendants of the ship 's original passengers have become morbidly obese after centuries of microgravity effects and relying on the ship 's automated systems for their every need , with their only way of movement being hovering chairs . The ship 's current captain , McCrea , leaves most of the ship 's operations under the control of its robotic autopilot , AUTO . 
 WALL @-@ E follows EVE to the bridge of the Axiom , where the captain learns that by putting the plant in the ship 's holo @-@ detector to verify Earth 's habitability , the Axiom will make a hyperjump back to Earth so the passengers can recolonize it . However , AUTO orders McCrea 's robotic assistant GO @-@ 4 to steal the plant as part of his own no @-@ return directive <unk> , which was issued to BnL autopilots after the corporation concluded in 2110 that the planet could not be saved . 
 With the plant missing , EVE is considered defective and taken to the repair bay along with WALL @-@ E for cleaning . WALL @-@ E mistakes the cleaning procedure performed on EVE for torture and tries to save her , accidentally releasing a quarantined horde of malfunctioning robots . The on @-@ board security systems then designate both WALL @-@ E and EVE as " rogue robots " . Fed up with WALL @-@ E 's disruptions , EVE takes him to the escape pod bay to send him home . There , they witness GO @-@ 4 disposing of the missing plant by placing it inside a pod which is set to self @-@ destruct mode . WALL @-@ E enters the pod to retrieve the plant , but GO @-@ 4 jettisons the pod into space . WALL @-@ E escapes with the plant before the pod explodes and uses a fire extinguisher to propel himself back toward the Axiom , where he and EVE reconcile and celebrate with a dance in space . 
 When the plant is brought to the captain , EVE 's recordings of Earth are analyzed and the captain concludes that mankind must return to restore the planet . However , AUTO reveals his directive and stages a mutiny . When WALL @-@ E tries to protect the plant , AUTO tasers and severely damages him . EVE realizes the only parts available to repair WALL @-@ E are in his truck back on Earth . She helps him bring the plant to the holo @-@ detector to activate the ship 's hyperjump . McCrea , fighting AUTO for control of the ship , manages to open the detector 's access hatch . AUTO partially crushes WALL @-@ E by closing the hatch before McCrea , who was forced to walk after being incapacitated by AUTO , can finally disable the autopilot . EVE places the plant in the holo @-@ detector , freeing WALL @-@ E and instantly setting the Axiom to hyperjump to Earth . 
 Upon arrival , EVE rushes WALL @-@ E back to his home where she repairs and reactivates him . However , his memory is erased and resumes his original programming as a waste compactor . Heartbroken , EVE gives WALL @-@ E an electrical farewell kiss , which restores his memory and personality . WALL @-@ E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the Axiom restore Earth and its environment . 
 = = Cast and characters = = 
 Ben Burtt produced the voice of WALL @-@ E ( Waste Allocation Load <unk> – Earth @-@ class ) , the title character . WALL @-@ E , a robot who has developed sentience , is the only robot of his kind shown to be still functioning on Earth . He is a small mobile compactor box with all @-@ terrain treads , three @-@ fingered shovel hands , binocular eyes , and retractable solar cells for power . Although working diligently to fulfill his directive to clean up the garbage ( all the while accompanied by his cockroach friend Hal and music playing from his on @-@ board recorder ) he is distracted by his curiosity , collecting trinkets of interest . He stores and displays these " treasures " such as a birdcage full of rubber ducks , a Rubik 's Cube , Zippo lighters , disposable cups filled with plastic cutlery and a golden trophy at his home where he examines and categorizes his finds while watching a video cassette of Hello , Dolly ! via an iPod viewed through a large Fresnel lens . 
 Burtt is also credited for the voice of M @-@ O ( <unk> <unk> ) , as well as most of the other robots . M @-@ O is a tiny , obsessively clean maintenance robot with rollers for hands who keeps Axiom clean . 
 Elissa Knight as EVE ( Extraterrestrial Vegetation <unk> ) , a sleek robot probe whose directive is to locate vegetation on Earth and verify habitability . She has a glossy white egg @-@ shaped body and blue LED eyes . She moves using antigravity technology and is equipped with scanners , specimen storage and a " quasar ion cannon " in her arm , which she is quick to use . 
 Jeff Garlin as Captain B. McCrea , the commander , and apparently only officer , on the Axiom . His duties as captain are daily routines , with the ship 's autopilot handling all true command functions . 
 Fred Willard as Shelby Forthright , historical CEO of the Buy n Large Corporation , shown only in videos recorded around the time of the Axiom 's initial launch . Constantly optimistic , Forthright proposed the evacuation plans , then to clean up and recolonize the planet . However , the corporation gave up after realizing how toxic Earth had become . Forthright is the only live action character with a speaking role , the first in any Pixar film . 
 <unk> , the text @-@ to @-@ speech program for the Apple Macintosh , was used for the voice of Auto , the rogue autopilot artificial intelligence built into the ship . Unlike other robots in the film , Auto is not influenced by WALL @-@ E , instead following directive <unk> , which is to prevent the Axiom and the humans from returning to Earth because of the toxicity , and it works to prevent anyone from deviating from it . 
 John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy as John and Mary , respectively . John and Mary both live on the Axiom and are so dependent on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings , for instance not noticing that the ship features a giant swimming pool . However , they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL @-@ E , eventually meeting face @-@ to @-@ face for the first time . 
 Sigourney Weaver as the voice of the Axiom 's computer . Stanton joked about the role with Weaver , saying , " You realize you get to be ' Mother ' now ? " referring to the name of the ship 's computer in the film Alien , which also starred Weaver .

 Andrew Stanton conceived WALL @-@ E during a lunch with fellow writers John Lasseter , Pete Docter , and Joe Ranft in 1994 . Toy Story was near completion and the writers brainstormed ideas for their next projects – A Bug 's Life , Monsters , Inc . , and Finding Nemo – at this lunch . Stanton asked , " What if mankind had to leave Earth and somebody forgot to turn off the last robot ? " Having struggled for many years with making the characters in Toy Story appealing , Stanton found his simple Robinson Crusoe @-@ esque idea of a lonely robot on a deserted planet strong . Stanton made WALL @-@ E a waste collector as the idea was instantly understandable , and because it was a low @-@ status menial job that made him sympathetic . Stanton also liked the imagery of stacked cubes of garbage . He did not find the idea dark because having a planet covered in garbage was for him a childish imagining of disaster . 
 Stanton and Pete Docter developed the film under the title of Trash Planet for two months in 1995 , but they did not know how to develop the story and Docter chose to direct Monsters , Inc. instead . Stanton came up with the idea of WALL @-@ E finding a plant , because his life as the sole inhabitant on a deserted world reminded Stanton of a plant growing among pavements . Before they turned their attention to other projects , Stanton and Lasseter thought about having WALL @-@ E fall in love , as it was the necessary progression away from loneliness . Stanton started writing WALL @-@ E again in 2002 while completing Finding Nemo . Stanton formatted his script in a manner reminiscent of Dan O 'Bannon 's Alien . O 'Bannon wrote his script in a manner Stanton found reminded him of haiku , where visual descriptions were done in continuous lines of a few words . Stanton wrote his robot dialogue conventionally , but placed them in brackets . In late 2003 , Stanton and a few others created a story reel of the first twenty minutes of the film . Lasseter and Steve Jobs were impressed and officially began development , though Jobs stated he did not like the title , originally spelled " <unk> " 
 While the first act of WALL @-@ E " fell out of the sky " for Stanton , he had originally wanted aliens to plant EVE to explore Earth and the rest of the film was different . When WALL @-@ E comes to the Axiom , he incites a Spartacus @-@ style rebellion by the robots against the remnants of the human race , which were cruel alien Gels ( completely devolved , gelatinous , boneless , legless , see @-@ through , green creatures that resemble Jell @-@ O ) . James Hicks , a physiologist , mentioned to Stanton the concept of atrophy and the effects prolonged weightlessness would have on humans living in space for an inordinately extended time period . Therefore , this was the inspiration of the humans degenerating into the alien Gels , and their ancestry would have been revealed in a Planet of the Apes @-@ style ending . The Gels also spoke a made @-@ up gibberish language , but Stanton scrapped this idea because he thought it would be too complicated for the audience to understand and they could easily be driven off from the storyline . The Gels had a royal family , who host a dance in a castle on a lake in the back of the ship , and the Axiom curled up into a ball when returning to Earth in this incarnation of the story . Stanton decided this was too bizarre and unengaging , and conceived humanity as " big babies " . Stanton developed the metaphorical theme of the humans learning to stand again and " grow [ ing ] up " , wanting WALL @-@ E and EVE 's relationship to inspire humanity because he felt few films explore how utopian societies come to exist . The process of depicting the descendants of humanity as the way they appear in the movie was slow . Stanton first decided to put a nose and ears on the Gels so the audience could recognize them . Eventually , fingers , legs , clothes , and other characteristics were added until they arrived at the concept of being fetus @-@ like to allow the audience to see themselves in the characters . 
 In a later version of the film , Auto comes to the docking bay to retrieve EVE 's plant . The film would have its first cutaway to the captain , but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL @-@ E 's point @-@ of @-@ view . As an homage to Get Smart , Auto takes the plant and goes into the bowels of the ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large 's scheme to clean up the Earth falling apart through the years . Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE . The captain appears to be unintelligent , but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged ; otherwise he would have been <unk> . One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside @-@ down , only to fix it before he challenges Auto . In the finished film , he merely wears it casually atop his head , tightening it when he assumes real command of the Axiom . 
 Originally , EVE would have been electrocuted by Auto , and then be quickly saved from ejection at the hands of the WALL @-@ A robots by WALL @-@ E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth . Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening , as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL @-@ E , and it made WALL @-@ E even more heroic if he held the holo @-@ detector open despite being badly hurt . Stanton also moved the moment where WALL @-@ E reveals his plant ( which he had snatched from the self @-@ destructing escape pod ) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape , as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship . Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film 's end . Jim Capobianco , director of the Ratatouille short film Your Friend the Rat , created an end credits animation that continued the story – and stylized in different artistic movements throughout history – to clarify an optimistic tone .

 WALL @-@ E was the most complex Pixar production since Monsters , Inc. because of the world and the history that had to be conveyed . Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75 @,@ 000 storyboards , WALL @-@ E required 125 @,@ 000 . Production designer Ralph Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic , and that of the second act on the Axiom to be cold and sterile . During the third act , the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the Axiom environment . Pixar studied Chernobyl and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world ; art director Anthony <unk> was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage . Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL @-@ E feel vulnerable . The overexposed light makes the location look more vast . Because of the haziness , the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large , otherwise they would have lost shape ( in turn , this helped save rendering time ) . The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives . When WALL @-@ E shows EVE all his collected items , all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere , like a Christmas tree . Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL @-@ E – who was made yellow to emulate a tractor – would not blend into the deserted Earth , and to make the plant more prominent . 
 Stanton also wanted the lighting to look realistic and evoke the science fiction films of his youth . He thought that Pixar captured the physics of being underwater with Finding Nemo and so for WALL @-@ E , he wanted to push that for air . While rewatching some of his favorite science fiction films , he realized that Pixar 's other movies had lacked the look of 70 mm film and its barrel distortion , lens flare , and racking focus . Producer Jim Morris invited Roger Deakins and Dennis Muren to advise on lighting and atmosphere . Muren spent several months with Pixar , while Deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks . Stanton said Muren 's experience came from integrating computer animation into live @-@ action settings , while Deakins helped them understand not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting . 1970s Panavision cameras were used to help the animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments . The first lighting test included building a three @-@ dimensional replica of WALL @-@ E , filming it with a 70 mm camera , and then trying to replicate that in the computer . Stanton cited the shallow lens work of Gus Van Sant 's films as an influence , as it created intimacy in each close @-@ up . Stanton chose angles for the virtual cameras that a live @-@ action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set . 
 Stanton wanted the Axiom 's interior to resemble Shanghai and Dubai . Eggleston studied 1960s NASA paintings and the original concept art for Tomorrowland for the Axiom , to reflect that era 's sense of optimism . Stanton remarked " We are all probably very similar in our backgrounds here [ at Pixar ] in that we all miss the Tomorrowland that was promised us from the heyday of Disneyland , " and wanted a " jet pack " feel . Pixar also studied the Disney Cruise Line and visited Las Vegas , which was helpful in understanding artificial lighting . Eggleston based his Axiom designs on the futuristic architecture of Santiago Calatrava . Eggleston divided the inside of the ship into three sections ; the rear 's economy class has a basic gray concrete texture with graphics keeping to the red , blue , and white of the BnL logo . The coach class with living / shopping spaces has " S " shapes as people are always looking for " what 's around the corner " . Stanton intended to have many colorful signs , but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston 's original idea of a small number of larger signs . The premier class is a large Zen @-@ like spa with colors limited to turquoise , cream , and tan , and leads on to the captain 's warm carpeted and wooded quarters and the sleek dark bridge . In keeping with the artificial Axiom , camera movements were modeled after those of the steadicam . 
 The use of live action was a stepping stone for Pixar , as Stanton was planning to make John Carter of Mars as his next project . <unk> Derek Thompson noted introducing live action meant that they would make the rest of the film look even more realistic . Eggleston added that if the historical humans had been animated and slightly <unk> , the audience then would not have been able to recognize how serious their devolution was . Stanton cast Fred Willard as the historical Buy n Large CEO because " [ h ] e 's the most friendly and insincere car salesman I could think of . " The CEO says " stay the course " , which Stanton used because he thought it was funny . Industrial Light & Magic did the visual effects for these shots . 
 = = = Animation = = = 
 WALL @-@ E went undeveloped during the 1990s partly because Stanton and Pixar were not confident enough yet to have a feature length film with a main character that behaved like Luxo Jr. or R2 @-@ D2 . Stanton explained there are two types of robots in cinema : " human [ s ] with metal skin " , like the Tin Man , or " machine [ s ] with function " like Luxo and R2 . He found the latter idea " powerful " because it allowed the audience to project personalities onto the characters , as they do with babies and pets : " You 're compelled ... you almost can 't stop yourself from finishing the sentence ' Oh , I think it likes me ! I think it 's hungry ! I think it wants to go for a walk ! ' " He added , " We wanted the audience to believe they were witnessing a machine that has come to life . " The animators visited recycling stations to study machinery , and also met robot designers , visited NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to study robots , watched a recording of a Mars rover , and borrowed a bomb detecting robot from the San Francisco Police Department . Simplicity was preferred in their performances as giving them too many movements would make them feel human . 
 Stanton wanted WALL @-@ E to be a box and EVE to be like an egg . WALL @-@ E 's eyes were inspired by a pair of binoculars Stanton was given when watching the Oakland Athletics play against the Boston Red Sox . He " missed the entire inning " because he was distracted by them . The director was reminded of Buster Keaton and decided the robot would not need a nose or mouth . Stanton added a zoom lens to make WALL @-@ E more sympathetic . Ralph Eggleston noted this feature gave the animators more to work with and gave the robot a childlike quality . Pixar 's studies of trash <unk> during their visits to recycling stations inspired his body . His tank treads were inspired by a wheelchair someone had developed that used treads instead of wheels . The animators wanted him to have elbows , but realized this was unrealistic because he is only designed to pull garbage into his body . His arms also looked flimsy when they did a test of him waving . Animation director Angus MacLane suggested they attach his arms to a track on the sides of his body to move them around , based on the inkjet printers his father designed . This arm design contributed to creating the character 's posture , so if they wanted him to be nervous , they would lower them . Stanton was unaware of the similarities between WALL @-@ E and Johnny 5 from Short Circuit until others pointed it out to him . 
 Stanton wanted EVE to be at the higher end of technology , and asked iPod designer Jonathan Ive to inspect her design . He was very impressed . Her eyes are modelled on Lite @-@ Brite toys , but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar . Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing , relying on posing her body to express emotion . They also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature . Auto was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from 2001 : A Space Odyssey , and the usage of Also sprach Zarathustra for the showdown between the captain and Auto furthers that . The manner in which he hangs from a wall gives him a threatening feel , like a spider . Originally , Auto was designed entirely differently , resembling EVE , but masculine and authoritative ; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol @-@ bots . The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build @-@ a @-@ bot program , where different heads , arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations . The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their <unk> bodies , as well as babies . The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film 's humans . 
 To animate their robots , the film 's story crew and animation crew watched a Keaton and a Charlie Chaplin film every day for almost a year , and occasionally a Harold Lloyd picture . Afterwards , the filmmakers knew all emotions could be conveyed silently . Stanton cited Keaton 's " great stone face " as giving them perseverance in animating a character with an unchanging expression . As he rewatched these , Stanton felt that filmmakers – since the advent of sound – relied on dialogue too much to convey exposition . The filmmakers dubbed the cockroach WALL @-@ E keeps as a pet " Hal " , in reference to silent film producer Hal Roach ( as well as being an additional reference to HAL 9000 ) . They also watched 2001 : A Space Odyssey , The Black Stallion and Never Cry Wolf , films that had sound but were not reliant on dialogue . Stanton acknowledged Silent Running as an influence because its silent robots were a forerunner to the likes of R2 @-@ D2 , and that the " hopeless romantic " Woody Allen also inspired WALL @-@ E. 
 = = = Sound = = = 
 Producer Jim Morris recommended Ben Burtt as sound designer for WALL @-@ E because Stanton kept using R2 @-@ D2 as the benchmark for the robots . Burtt had completed Star Wars : Episode III – Revenge of the Sith and told his wife he would no longer work on films with robots , but found WALL @-@ E and its substitution of voices with sound " fresh and exciting " . He recorded 2500 sounds for the film , which was twice the average number for a Star Wars film , and a record in his career . Burtt began work in 2005 , and experimented with filtering his voice for two years . Burtt described the robot voices as " like a toddler [ ... ] universal language of intonation . ' Oh ' , ' <unk> ? ' , ' Huh ! ' , you know ? " 
 During production Burtt had the opportunity to look at the items used by Jimmy MacDonald , Disney 's in @-@ house sound designer for many of their classic films . Burtt used many of MacDonald 's items on WALL @-@ E. Because Burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post @-@ production , the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas , which Burtt found an unusual experience . He worked in sync with the animators , returning their animation after adding the sounds to give them more ideas . Burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character , but if he could not find one that worked , he would choose a dramatic if unrealistic noise . Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters , before he and Stanton pared it down to a distinct few for each robot . 
 Burtt saw a hand @-@ cranked electrical generator while watching Island in the Sky , and bought an identical , unpacked device from 1950 on eBay to use for WALL @-@ E moving around . Burtt also used an automobile self starter for when WALL @-@ E goes fast , and the sound of cars being wrecked at a demolition derby provided for WALL @-@ E 's compressing trash in his body . The Macintosh computer chime was used to signify when WALL @-@ E has fully recharged his battery . For EVE , Burtt wanted her humming to have a musical quality . Burtt was only able to provide neutral or masculine voices , so Pixar employee Elissa Knight was asked to provide her voice for Burtt to electronically modify . Stanton deemed the sound effect good enough to properly cast her in the role . Burtt recorded a flying 10 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) radio @-@ controlled jet plane for EVE 's flying , and for her plasma cannon , Burtt hit a slinky hung from a ladder with a timpani stick . He described it as a " cousin " to the blaster noise from Star Wars . 
 <unk> was used because Stanton " wanted Auto to be the epitome of a robot , cold , zeros & ones , calculating , and soulless [ and ] Stephen Hawking 's kind of voice I thought was perfect . " Additional sounds for the character were meant to give him a clockwork feel , to show he is always thinking and calculating . 
 Burtt had visited Niagara Falls in 1987 and used his recordings from his trip for the sounds of wind . He ran around a hall with a canvas bag up to record the sandstorm though . For the scene where WALL @-@ E runs from falling shopping carts , Burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket and placed a recorder in their cart . They crashed it around the parking lot and then let it tumble down a hill . To create Hal ( WALL @-@ E 's pet cockroach ) ' s skittering , he recorded the clicking caused by taking apart and reassembling handcuffs .

 Thomas Newman <unk> with Stanton on WALL @-@ E since the two got along well on Nemo , which gave Newman the Annie Award for Best Music in an Animated Feature . He began writing the score in 2005 , in the hope that starting this task early would make him more involved with the finished film . But , Newman remarked that animation is so dependent on scheduling he should have begun work earlier on when Stanton and Reardon were writing the script . EVE 's theme was arranged for the first time in October 2007 . Her theme when played as she first flies around Earth originally used more orchestral elements , and Newman was encouraged to make it sound more feminine . Newman said Stanton had thought up many ideas for how he wanted the music to sound , and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult . Stanton wanted the whole score to be orchestral , but Newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard the Axiom , and used electronics too . 
 Stanton originally wanted to juxtapose the opening shots of space with 1930s French swing music , but he saw The Triplets of Belleville ( 2003 ) and did not want to appear as if he were copying it . Stanton then thought about the song " Put On Your Sunday Clothes " from Hello , Dolly ! , since he had portrayed the sidekick Barnaby Tucker in a 1980 high school production . Stanton found that the song was about two naive young men looking for love , which was similar to WALL @-@ E 's own hope for companionship . Jim Reardon suggested WALL @-@ E find the film on video , and Stanton included " It Only Takes a Moment " and the clip of the actors holding hands , because he wanted a visual way to show how WALL @-@ E understands love and conveys it to EVE . Hello Dolly ! composer Jerry Herman allowed the songs to be used without knowing what for ; when he saw the film , he found its incorporation into the story " genius " . Coincidentally , Newman 's uncle Lionel worked on Hello , Dolly ! 
 Newman travelled to London to compose the end credits song " Down to Earth " with Peter Gabriel , who was one of Stanton 's favorite musicians . Afterwards , Newman rescored some of the film to include the song 's composition , so it would not sound intrusive when played . Louis Armstrong 's rendition of " La Vie en rose " was used for a montage where WALL @-@ E does not get EVE 's attention on Earth . The script also specified using Bing Crosby 's " Stardust " for when the two robots dance around the Axiom , but Newman asked if he could score the scene himself . A similar switch occurred for the sequence in which WALL @-@ E attempts to wake EVE up through various means ; originally , the montage would play with the instrumental version of " Raindrops Keep Fallin ' on My Head " , but Newman wanted to challenge himself and scored an original piece for the sequence .

 This movie is widely recognized as a critique on society . It brings up real issues that the world , and especially densely populated areas , are dealing with today and even more so in the future . Katherine Ellison asserts that “ Americans produce nearly 400 million tons of solid waste per year but recycle less than a third of it , according to a recent Columbia University study . ” <unk> are filling up so quickly that the UK may run out of landfill space by the year 2017 . 
 = = = Environment and waste = = = 
 Because WALL @-@ E overtly critiques consumerism , it also critiques Disney 's production values and aesthetic , without being too obvious . In the DVD commentary , Stanton said that he has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism . His answer was it was not ; it was a way to answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself . 
 In " WALL @-@ E : from environmental adaption to sentimental nostalgia , " Robin Murray and Joseph <unk> explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film . Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts , left behind , that WALL @-@ E collects and cherishes , i.e. Zippo lighters , hubcaps , and plastic <unk> . These modern items that we use out of necessity , are made sentimental through the lens of the bleak future of Earth . Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score , as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms in to a waste filled Earth while playing " Put on Your Sunday Clothes " , reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history . This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural world , as it is the sight and feeling of soil , and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE , that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth . WALL @-@ E expresses nostalgia also , by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films . 
 Stanton describes the theme of the film as " irrational love defeats life 's programming " : 
 I realized the point I was trying to push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and figure out what the point of living was ... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built ... I realized that that 's a perfect metaphor for real life . We all fall into our habits , our routines and our ruts , consciously or unconsciously to avoid living . To avoid having to do the messy part . To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us . That 's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another . I thought , ' That 's a perfect amplification of the whole point of the movie . ' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that . 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 Stanton noted many commentators placed emphasis on the environmental aspect of humanity 's complacency in the film , because " that disconnection is going to be the cause , indirectly , of anything that happens in life that 's bad for humanity or the planet " . Stanton said that by taking away effort to work , the robots also take away humanity 's need to put effort into relationships . Christian journalist Rod Dreher saw technology as the complicated villain of the film . The humans ' artificial lifestyle on the Axiom has separated them from nature , making them " slaves of both technology and their own base appetites , and have lost what makes them human " . Dreher contrasted the hardworking , dirt covered WALL @-@ E with the sleek clean robots on the ship . However , it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant . Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra @-@ modern technology . During the end credits humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth . " WALL @-@ E is not a Luddite film , " he said . " It doesn 't demonize technology . It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature – that it must be subordinate to human flourishing , and help move that along . " 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Stanton , who is a Christian , named EVE after the Biblical character because WALL @-@ E 's loneliness reminded him of Adam , before God created his wife . Dreher noted EVE 's biblical namesake and saw her directive as an inversion of that story ; EVE uses the plant to tell humanity to return to Earth and move away from the " false god " of BnL and the lazy lifestyle it offers . Dreher also noted this departure from classical Christian viewpoints , where Adam is cursed to labor , in that WALL @-@ E argues hard work is what makes humans human . Dreher emphasized the false god parallels to BnL in a scene where a robot teaches infants " B is for Buy n Large , your very best friend " , which he compared to modern corporations such as McDonald 's creating brand loyalty in children . Megan Basham of World magazine felt the film criticizes the pursuit of leisure , whereas WALL @-@ E in his stewardship learns to truly appreciate God 's creation . 
 During writing , a Pixar employee noted to Jim Reardon that EVE was reminiscent of the dove with the olive branch from the story of Noah 's Ark , and the story was reworked with EVE finding a plant to return humanity from its voyage . WALL @-@ E himself has been compared to Prometheus , Sisyphus , and <unk> : in an essay discussing WALL @-@ E as representative of the artistic strive of Pixar itself , <unk> Vartanian compared WALL @-@ E to <unk> in a scene where the robot expresses his love for EVE by making a sculpture of her from spare parts . " The Ancient Greek tradition associates the birth of art with a Corinthian maiden who longing to preserve her lover ’ s shadow traces it on the wall before he departed for war . The myth reminds us that art was born out of longing and often means more for the creator than the muse . In the same way Stanton and his Pixar team have told us a deeply personal story about their love of cinema and their vision for animation through the prism of all types of relationships . "

 Continuing a Pixar tradition , WALL @-@ E was paired with a short film for its theatrical release , Presto . The film was dedicated to Justin Wright ( 1981 – 2008 ) , a Pixar animator who had worked on Ratatouille and died of a heart attack before WALL @-@ E 's release . 
 Walt Disney Imagineering ( <unk> ) built animatronic WALL @-@ E 's to promote the picture , which made appearances at Disneyland Resort , the Franklin Institute , the Miami Science Museum , the Seattle Center , and the Tokyo International Film Festival . Due to safety concerns , the 318 kg robots were always strictly controlled and <unk> always needed to know exactly what they were required to interact with . For this reason , they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at the theme parks in case a WALL @-@ E trod on a child 's foot . Those who wanted to take a photograph with the character had to make do with a cardboard cutout . 
 Very small quantities of merchandise were sold for WALL @-@ E , as Cars items were still popular , and many manufacturers were more interested in Speed Racer , which was a successful line despite the film 's failure at the box office . Thinkway , which created the WALL @-@ E toys , had previously made Toy Story dolls when other toy producers had not shown an interest . Among Thinkway 's items were a WALL @-@ E that danced when connected to a music player , a toy that could be taken apart and reassembled , and a groundbreaking remote control toy of him and EVE that had motion sensors that allowed them to interact with players . There were even plushies . The " Ultimate WALL @-@ E " figures were not in stores until the film 's home release in November 2008 , at a retail price of almost $ 200 , leading The Patriot @-@ News to deem it an item for " hard @-@ core fans and collectors only " . On February 4 , 2015 , Lego announced that a WALL @-@ E custom built by lead animator Angus MacLane was the latest design approved for mass production and release as part of Lego Ideas .

 = = = Critical reaction = = = 
 The American Film Institute named WALL @-@ E as one of the best films of 2008 ; the jury rationale states : 
 WALL • E proves to this generation and beyond that the film medium 's only true boundaries are the human imagination . Writer / director Andrew Stanton and his team have created a classic screen character from a metal trash compactor who rides to the rescue of a planet buried in the debris that embodies the broken promise of American life . Not since Chaplin 's " Little Tramp " has so much story — so much emotion — been conveyed without words . When hope arrives in the form of a seedling , the film blossoms into one of the great screen romances as two robots remind audiences of the beating heart in all of us that yearns for humanity — and love — in the darkest of landscapes . 
 The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 96 % of critics gave the film positive reviews , based upon a sample of 244 reviews , with an average rating of 8 @.@ 5 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads " Charming , audacious , and timely , WALL @-@ E 's lighthearted magic and stellar visuals testify once again to Pixar 's ingenuity . " At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film received an average score of 94 based on 39 representing " universal acclaim " . indieWire named WALL @-@ E the third best film of the year based on their annual survey of 100 film critics , while Movie City News shows that WALL @-@ E appeared in 162 different Top 10 lists , out of 286 different critics lists surveyed , the most mentions on a Top 10 list of any film released in 2008 . 
 Richard Corliss of Time named WALL @-@ E his favorite film of 2008 ( and later of the decade ) , noting the film succeeded in " connect [ ing ] with a huge audience " despite the main characters ' lack of speech and " emotional signifiers like a mouth , eyebrows , shoulders , [ and ] elbows " . It " evoke [ d ] the splendor of the movie past " and he also compared WALL @-@ E and EVE 's relationship to the chemistry of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn . Other critics who named WALL @-@ E their favorite film of 2008 included Tom Charity of CNN , Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune , Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly , A. O. Scott of The New York Times , Christopher Orr of The New Republic , Ty Burr and Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe , Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal , and Anthony Lane of The New Yorker . 
 Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film " Pixar 's ninth consecutive wonder " , saying it was imaginative yet straightforward . He said it pushed the boundaries of animation by balancing esoteric ideas with more immediately accessible ones , and that the main difference between the film and other science fiction projects rooted in an apocalypse was its optimism . Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter declared that WALL @-@ E surpassed the achievements of Pixar 's previous eight features and probably their most original film to date . He said it had the " heart , soul , spirit and romance " of the best silent films . Honeycutt said the film 's definitive stroke of brilliance was in using a mix of archive film footage and computer graphics to trigger WALL @-@ E 's romantic leanings . He praised Burtt 's sound design , saying " If there is such a thing as an aural sleight of hand , this is it . " 
 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times named WALL @-@ E " an enthralling animated film , a visual wonderment , and a decent science @-@ fiction story " and said the scarcity of dialogue would allow it to " cross language barriers " in a manner appropriate to the global theme , and noted it would appeal to adults and children . He praised the animation , describing the color palette as " bright and cheerful [ ... ] and a little bit realistic " , and that Pixar managed to generate a " curious " regard for the WALL @-@ E , comparing his " rusty and hard @-@ working and plucky " design favorably to more obvious attempts at creating " lovable " lead characters . He said WALL @-@ E was concerned with ideas rather than spectacle , saying it would trigger stimulating " little thoughts for the younger viewers . " He named it as one of his twenty favorite films of 2008 and argued it was " the best science @-@ fiction movie in years " . 
 The film was interpreted as tackling a topical , ecologically @-@ minded agenda , though McCarthy said it did so with a lightness of touch that granted the viewer the ability to accept or ignore the message . Kyle Smith of the New York Post , wrote that by depicting future humans as " a flabby mass of <unk> idiots who are literally too fat to walk " , WALL @-@ E was darker and more cynical than any major Disney feature film he could recall . He compared the humans to the patrons of Disney 's Parks and Resorts , adding , " I 'm also not sure I 've ever seen a major corporation spend so much money to issue an insult to its customers . " Maura <unk> of U.S. News & World Report questioned whether this depiction of " frighteningly obese humans " would resonate with children and make them prefer to " play outside rather than in front of the computer , to avoid a similar fate " . The interpretation led to criticism of the film by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck , and contributors to National Review Online including Shannen W. Coffin and Jonah Goldberg ( although he admitted it was a " fascinating " and occasionally " brilliant " production ) . 
 A few notable critics have argued that the film is vastly overrated , claiming it failed to " live up to such blinding , high @-@ wattage enthusiasm " , and that there were " chasms of boredom watching it " , in particular " the second and third acts spiraled into the expected " . Other labels included " preachy " and " too long " . Child reviews sent into CBBC were mixed , some citing boredom and an inadequate storyline . 
 Patrick J. Ford of The American Conservative said WALL @-@ E 's conservative critics missed lessons in the film that he felt appealed to traditional conservatism . He argued that the mass consumerism in the film was not shown to be a product of big business , but of too close a tie between big business and big government : " The government unilaterally provided its citizens with everything they needed , and this lack of variety led to Earth 's downfall . " Responding to Coffin 's claim that the film points out the evils of mankind , Ford argued the only evils depicted were those that resulted from losing touch with our own humanity and that fundamental conservative representations such as the farm , the family unit , and wholesome entertainment were in the end held aloft by the human characters . He concluded , " By steering conservative families away from WALL @-@ E , these commentators are doing their readers a great disservice . " 
 Director Terry Gilliam praised the film as " A stunning bit of work . The scenes on what was left of planet Earth are just so beautiful : one of the great silent movies . And the most stunning artwork ! It says more about ecology and society than any live action film – all the people on their <unk> floating around , brilliant stuff . Their social comment was so smart and right on the button . "

 WALL @-@ E won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for Best Original Screenplay , Best Original Score , Best Original Song , Sound Editing , and Sound Mixing at the 81st Academy Awards , which it lost to Slumdog Millionaire ( Original Score , Original Song , Sound Mixing ) , The Dark Knight ( Sound Editing ) , and Milk ( Original Screenplay ) . Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination , but it was not nominated , provoking controversy as to whether the Academy deliberately restricted WALL @-@ E to the Best Animated Feature category . Peter Travers commented that " If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for best picture it 's Wall @-@ E. " Only three animated films , 1991 's Beauty and the Beast and Pixar 's next two films , 2009 's Up and 2010 's Toy Story 3 , have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture . A reflective Stanton stated he was not disappointed the film was restricted to the Best Animated Film nomination because he was overwhelmed by the film 's positive reception , and eventually " The line [ between live @-@ action and animation ] is just getting so blurry that I think with each proceeding year , it 's going to be tougher and tougher to say what 's an animated movie and what 's not an animated movie . " 
 WALL @-@ E made a healthy appearance at the various 2008 end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ year awards circles , particularly in the Best Picture category , where animated films are often overlooked . It has won the award , or the equivalent of it , from the Boston Society of Film Critics ( tied with Slumdog Millionaire ) , the Chicago Film Critics Association , the Central Ohio Film Critics awards , the Online Film Critics Society , and most notably the Los Angeles Film Critics Association , where it became the first animated feature to win the prestigious award . It was named as one of 2008 's ten best films by the American Film Institute and the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures . 
 It won Best Animated Feature Film at the 66th Golden Globe Awards , 81st Academy Awards and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards 2008 . It was nominated for several awards at the 2009 Annie Awards , including Best Feature Film , Animated Effects , Character Animation , Direction , Production design , Storyboarding and Voice acting ( for Ben Burtt ) ; but was beaten out by Kung Fu Panda in every category . It won Best Animated Feature at the 62nd British Academy Film Awards , and was also nominated there for Best Music and Sound . Thomas Newman and Peter Gabriel won two Grammy Awards for " Down to Earth " and " Define Dancing " . It won all three awards it was nominated for by the Visual Effects Society : Best Animation , Best Character Animation ( for WALL @-@ E and EVE in the truck ) and Best Effects in the Animated Motion Picture categories . It became the first animated film to win Best Editing for a Comedy or Musical from the American Cinema Editors . In 2009 , Stanton , Reardon and Docter won the Nebula Award , beating The Dark Knight and the Stargate Atlantis episode " The Shrine " . It won Best Animated Film and was nominated for Best Director at the Saturn Awards . 
 At the British National Movie Awards , which is voted for by the public , it won Best Family Film . It was also voted Best Feature Film at the British Academy Children 's Awards . WALL @-@ E was listed at # 63 on Empire 's online poll of the 100 greatest movie characters , conducted in 2008 . In early 2010 , TIME ranked WALL @-@ E # 1 in " Best Movies of the Decade " . In Sight & Sound magazine 's 2012 poll for the greatest films of all time , WALL @-@ E is the second highest ranking animated film behind My Neighbor Totoro ( 1988 ) , while tying with the film Spirited Away ( 2001 ) . 
 It was nominated for the 2009 Kids ' Choice Awards , but lost to Madagascar : Escape 2 Africa .

 = 6th Airlanding Brigade ( United Kingdom ) = 
 The 6th Airlanding Brigade was a airborne infantry brigade of the British Army during the Second World War . Created during May 1943 , the brigade was composed of three glider infantry battalions and supporting units , and was assigned to the 6th Airborne Division , alongside the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade . 
 During the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944 , the brigade took part in Operation Mallard , holding the southern flank of the bridgehead over the Orne River . In August 1944 , along with the rest of the 6th Airborne Division , it took part in the advance to the River Seine . Withdrawn to England in September , the brigade returned to mainland Europe to counter the surprise German offensive in the Ardennes , better known as the Battle of the Bulge . Their final airborne mission of the war was Operation Varsity in March 1945 , an assault crossing of the Rhine , after which they advanced through Germany , reaching the Baltic Sea at Wismar by the end of the war . 
 The brigade was withdrawn from Germany at the end of May 1945 and was sent , together with the rest of 6th Airborne Division in Palestine to provide internal security . Following the arrival of the 1st Parachute Brigade , however , the 6th Airlanding Brigade was no longer needed there and was returned to normal infantry duties , and renamed the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade . 
 = = Background = = 
 Impressed by the success of German airborne operations during the Battle of France , the British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a force of 5 @,@ 000 parachute troops . As a result , on 22 June 1940 , No. 2 Commando assumed parachute duties , and on 21 November was re @-@ designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion , with a parachute and glider wing . This later became the 1st Parachute Battalion . 
 On 21 June 1940 the Central Landing Establishment was formed at Ringway airfield near Manchester . Although tasked primarily with training parachute troops , it was also directed to investigate the use of gliders to transport troops into battle . At the same time , the Ministry of Aircraft Production contracted General Aircraft Ltd to design and produce a glider for this purpose . The result was the General Aircraft Hotspur , an aircraft capable of transporting eight soldiers , that was used for both assault and training purposes . 
 The success of the first British airborne raid , Operation Colossus , prompted the War Office to expand the airborne force through the creation of the Parachute Regiment , and to develop plans to convert several infantry battalions into parachute and glider battalions . On 31 May 1941 , a joint Army and RAF memorandum was approved by the Chiefs @-@ of @-@ Staff and Winston Churchill ; it recommended that the British airborne forces should consist of two parachute brigades , one based in England and the other in the Middle East , and that a glider force of 10 @,@ 000 men should be created . 
 = = Formation = = 
 On 23 April 1943 , the War Office gave permission to raise a second airborne division , the 6th Airborne . The division comprised the 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades and the 6th Airlanding Brigade , giving it two parachute and one airlanding brigades , which became the standard British complement for an airborne division . In May 1943 Brigadier Hugh Kindersley was appointed as the airlanding brigade 's first Commanding Officer . Under his command he had two experienced battalions transferred from the 1st Airlanding Brigade : the 2nd Battalion , Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry ( 2nd OBLI ) and the 1st Battalion , Royal Ulster Rifles ( 1st RUR ) . They were joined by a unit newly transferred to the airborne forces , the 12th Battalion , Devonshire Regiment ( 12th Devons ) , a hostilities @-@ only unit formed during the war , as the brigade 's third infantry battalion . Other units assigned around the same time were the 53rd ( Worcestershire Yeomanry ) Airlanding Light Regiment , Royal Artillery , the 249th ( Airborne ) Field Company , Royal Engineers and the 195th ( Airlanding ) Field Ambulance , Royal Army Medical Corps . 
 The airlanding brigade was an important part of the airborne division , its strength being almost equal to that of the two parachute brigades combined . In particular , its infantry battalions were the " most heavily armed in the British Army . " Each airlanding battalion had an establishment of 1034 men , serving in four rifle companies , a support and a headquarters company . A rifle company was sub @-@ divided into four platoons , the support company into six : two anti @-@ tank platoons with four 6 pounder guns in each , two mortar platoons with twelve 3 inch mortars between them , and two Vickers machine gun platoons with four guns in each platoon . The headquarters company had signals , assault pioneer , transport and administration platoons . 
 Air transport for the brigade was normally the Airspeed Horsa glider , piloted by two soldiers from the Glider Pilot Regiment . With a wingspan of 88 feet ( 27 m ) and a length of 67 feet ( 20 m ) , the Horsa had a maximum load capacity of 15 @,@ 750 pounds ( 7 @,@ 140 kg ) — space for two pilots , and a maximum of either 28 troops or two jeeps , one jeep and a 6 pounder gun , or one jeep with a trailer . It required 62 Horsas and one General Aircraft Hamilcar glider to transport an airlanding battalion into action . The Hamilcar carried the battalion 's two Universal Carriers , which were used to support the mortar and machine @-@ gun platoons . 
 At the end of the war in 1945 , the 12th Battalion , Devonshire Regiment , formed during the war , was disbanded , and replaced by the 1st Battalion , Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders , of the Regular Army . Brigadier Roger Bower was also appointed to command the brigade for service in Palestine . 
 The 6th Airlanding Brigade had always been an integral part of the 6th Airborne Division , but when the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded , and its 1st Parachute Brigade was assigned to the 6th Airborne Division , the 6th Airlanding Brigade became surplus to the division 's requirements . On 15 April 1946 , the brigade ceased being part of the British airborne forces , and was renumbered the 31st Independent Infantry Brigade . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 From June to December 1943 , the 6th Airlanding Brigade , as part of the 6th Airborne Division , prepared for operations , and trained at every level from section up to division by day and night . Airborne soldiers were expected to fight against superior numbers of the enemy equipped with artillery and tanks . So training was designed to encourage a spirit of self @-@ discipline , self @-@ reliance and aggressiveness . Emphasis was given to physical fitness , marksmanship and fieldcraft . A large part of the training consisted of assault courses and route marching . Military exercises included capturing and holding airborne bridgeheads , road or rail bridges and coastal fortifications . At the end of most exercises , the troops would march back to their barracks , usually a distance of around 20 miles ( 32 km ) . An ability to cover long distances at speed was expected : airborne platoons were required to cover a distance of 50 miles ( 80 km ) in 24 hours , and battalions 32 miles ( 51 km ) . 
 In April 1944 , under the command of 1st Airborne Corps , the brigade took part in Exercise Mush . This was a three @-@ day exercise in the counties of Gloucestershire , Oxfordshire and Wiltshire , during which the entire 6th Airborne Division was landed by air . Unknown to the troops involved , the exercise was a full @-@ scale rehearsal for the division 's involvement in the imminent invasion of Normandy . In the invasion , the division 's two parachute brigades would land in the early hours of 6 June in Operation Tonga ; the airlanding brigade would not arrive until almost dusk on the same day . Their objective was to secure the left flank of the invasion area , between the rivers Orne and Dives . 
 = = = Normandy = = = 
 One of the first Allied units to land in Normandy was ' D ' Company of the 2nd Ox and Bucks Light Infantry , commanded by Major John Howard . The company , attached to the 5th Parachute Brigade , carried out Operation Deadstick , a coup de main assault on two bridges crossing the Caen Canal and the River Orne . 
 Almost 21 hours later the 6th Airlanding Brigade 's main air assault on Normandy , Operation Mallard , began . Included in the operation was the brigade , the 6th Airborne Division 's reconnaissance regiment , and one of its howitzer batteries . The combined force crossed the English Channel in 250 gliders , arriving at their landing zones at 21 : 00 6 June 1944 . 
 The gliders carrying the brigade headed for two separated landing areas , Landing Zone ' W ' ( LZ @-@ W ) to the east of Saint @-@ Aubin @-@ d <unk> and Landing Zone ' N ' ( LZ @-@ N ) to the north of Ranville . The gliders landing on LZ @-@ W contained the remaining men of the 2nd OBLI , and ' A ' Company , 12th Devons landed at LZ @-@ W. Given the limited availability of aircraft , the remainder of the Devons battalion and the divisional troops were transported by sea , arriving at Sword Beach on 7 June . The brigade headquarters and 1st RUR landed at LZ @-@ N. LZ @-@ N was still within range of the German defenders , and the disembarking troops were subjected to light machine gun and mortar fire , however they only lost one man , who was killed by a sniper . 
 At 22 : 30 Brigadier Kindersley briefed the two battalion commanding officers , ordering the 2nd OBLI to capture the village of Escoville 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) to the south of Ranville , and the 1st RUR to capture Longueval , 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) south @-@ west of the Le Bas de Ranville , and Sainte @-@ Honorine . 
 By 04 : 30 7 June the 2nd OBLI had reached Herourvillette . Finding the village unoccupied they left a company behind to defend it , and at 08 : 30 the rest of the battalion headed for Escoville . They arrived at the village at 11 : 00 having only been confronted by sniper fire . The Germans assembling on the heights overlooking the village attacked at 15 : 00 . Fighting at close quarters and house to house , by 16 : 00 the battalion was forced to withdraw back to Herourvillette . The battle cost them 87 casualties , including the commanding officer . 
 It was not until 09 : 00 that the 1st RUR were in position to carry out a left flanking attack on <unk> . The village was clear of Germans so they pressed on towards Sainte @-@ Honorine . When between the two villages , the battalion was engaged by German mortar , artillery and assault gun fire , and suffered several casualties . Two companies managed to reach Sainte @-@ Honorine , but with no artillery fire support of their own , and out of radio contact with their battalion headquarters , they were forced to withdraw back to Longueval . 
 Around the same time , the 12th Devons had arrived in the divisional area from the landing beaches and were ordered to take over the defence of the Bas de Ranville from the 12th Parachute Battalion . Because they were positioned behind the brigade front line , they were not directly attacked , but from 11 : 00 to 18 : 30 on 8 June they were subjected to a constant artillery bombardment . 
 On 9 June the 2nd OBLI sent a company back to Escoville to confirm if it was still held by the Germans . Finding it occupied by infantry with armour support , they withdrew back to Herourvillette . At 18 : 30 the battalion was attacked by Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft and at 19 : 00 the whole brigade 's position was bombarded by German artillery and mortar fire . This was followed by an infantry and tank assault . Supported by their own and the division 's anti @-@ tank guns and artillery , the battalion stopped the attack around 100 yards ( 91 m ) from their lines . By 21 : 30 the attack was over , and the Germans withdrew having lost eight tanks , two armoured cars and two self @-@ propelled guns . 
 At the same time , German tanks and infantry attacked the 12th Devons . By 20 : 30 they had advanced to within 50 yards ( 46 m ) of the battalion 's positions . With the airborne artillery regiment busy assisting the 2nd OBLI , the Devons had to call on the artillery from the British 3rd Infantry Division to break up the attack . Activity over the next few days was limited to skirmishes and patrol activity , until the night of the 13 June when the brigade was relieved by units of the 51st ( Highland ) Infantry Division . The brigade was repositioned in the area of Breville between the 5th Parachute Brigade and the commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade . Here they remained in a defensive position until mid August , conducting patrols to hold the Germans ' attention . 
 = = = Advance to the Seine = = = 
 On 7 August the 6th Airborne division was ordered to prepare to move over to the offensive , with its objective being the mouth of the River Seine . The division began to advance as the Germans retreated from France following their defeat in the Battle of Falaise . The 6th Airlanding Brigade , now commanded by Brigadier Edward Flavell , had the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade and the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade under its command . Together they would form the left flank of the division 's advance , moving along the French coast , while the remainder of the division advanced further inland . 
 The 6th Airlanding Brigade advance started on 17 August along two axes , with the 12th Devons on the left , the 2nd OBLI on the right , and the 1st RUR in reserve . At <unk> the 12th Devons had to fight through the German rearguard , and the 1st RUR took over the advance on the left and reached Cabourg without meeting any further resistance . 
 The brigade group was moved to an area east of Troarn on 21 August . With the 12th Devons leading they advanced again , occupying <unk> , <unk> and Deauville on 22 August . Attempts to cross the River Touques were repulsed by a force estimated to be around 1 @,@ 200 men . <unk> the German position , the 2nd OBLI crossed the river at Touques on 24 August . Keeping the pressure on the retreating Germans on 25 August , Le Correspondence , <unk> and Malhortie were captured . However , the Germans had retained control of the bridge outside Malhortie and the high ground at <unk> @-@ la @-@ <unk> . The 2nd OBLI attacked and captured the bridge intact , but <unk> @-@ la @-@ <unk> was only taken at dusk , at the cost of several casualties . The next day , 26 August , the battalion captured Foulbec on the River Seine at 19 : 00 , although not before the Germans had destroyed the bridge , and earlier that day the 1st RUR had captured Berville @-@ sur @-@ Mer . On 27 August the division was ordered to concentrate in the area between Honfleur and Pont Audemer . 
 In nine days of fighting the 6th Airborne Division had advanced 45 miles ( 72 km ) , despite , as the divisional commander Major @-@ General Richard Nelson Gale put it , his infantry units being " quite inadequately equipped for a rapid pursuit " . The division had captured 400 square miles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) of territory and taken over 1 @,@ 000 German soldiers prisoner . Since landing on 6 June the division 's casualties were 4 @,@ 457 , of which 821 were killed , 2 @,@ 709 wounded and 927 missing . The 6th Airlanding Brigade suffered 115 men killed during the campaign . The division was withdrawn from France , and embarked for England at the beginning of September . 
 = = = Ardennes = = = 
 In England the brigade went into a period of recruitment and training , concentrating on house to house street fighting in the bombed areas of Southampton and Birmingham . The training programme culminated in Exercise Eve , an assault on the River Thames , which was intended to simulate the River Rhine in Germany . 
 By December the brigade was preparing for Christmas leave , when news of the German offensive in the Ardennes broke . As part of the First Allied Airborne Army , 6th Airborne Division was available as a component of the strategic reserve for the Allied forces in northwest Europe . The other two divisions available in reserve , the American 82nd and 101st Airborne , were already at Rheims in northern France , and the 6th Airborne was sent by sea to Belgium to assist the defence . With 29 German and 33 Allied divisions involved , the Battle of the Bulge was the largest single battle on the Western Front during the war . On Christmas Day the division moved up to take position in front of the spearhead of the German advance ; by Boxing Day they had reached their allocated places in the defensive line between Dinant and Namur . The 3rd Parachute Brigade were on the left , 5th Parachute Brigade on the right , and the airlanding brigade in reserve . Over the next days the German advance was halted and forced back , until at the end of January 1945 , the brigade crossed into the Netherlands . Here the division was made responsible for the area along the River Maas , between Venlo and Roermond . The brigade carried out patrols , on both sides of the river , against their opponents from the German 7th Parachute Division . Near the end of February the division returned to England to prepare for another airborne mission , to cross the River Rhine into Germany . 
 = = = Rhine = = = 
 Whereas all other Allied airborne landings had been a surprise for the Germans , the Rhine crossing was expected , and their defences were reinforced in anticipation . The airborne operation was preceded by a two @-@ day round @-@ the @-@ clock bombing mission by the Allied air forces . Then on 23 March 3 @,@ 500 artillery guns targeted the German positions . At dusk Operation Plunder , an assault river crossing of the Rhine by the 21st Army Group , began . For their part in Operation Varsity , the 6th Airborne Division was assigned to the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps alongside the U.S. 17th Airborne Division . 
 The 6th Airlanding Brigade , now commanded by Brigadier Hugh Bellamy , was given several objectives in the operation . The 2nd OBLI , landing in the north , had to secure the bridges over the River Issel . The 1st RUR had the main road bridge over the river from Hamminkeln to <unk> as their objective , and the 12th Devons were to capture the town of Hamminkeln . 
 As in Normandy , the division 's two parachute brigades were already on the ground before the 6th Airlanding Brigade started landing at 10 : 30 24 March 1945 . The German defenders had been alerted , and the gliders were met by a concentrated anti @-@ aircraft barrage . This caused the brigade around 40 per cent casualties in men and 50 per cent in equipment . Nevertheless , by 11 : 00 the 2nd OBLI and 1st RUR had captured their objectives . The 12th Devons landed amongst a German armoured formation , but managed to gather enough men together to begin their attack on Hamminkeln at 11 : 35 , and had secured the town by 12 : 00 . 
 At midnight the 2nd OBLI were attacked by a force of tanks and infantry . One of the battalion positions at the eastern side of the road bridge was overrun , and had to be recaptured with a counter @-@ attack . Another attack two hours later was in danger of capturing the bridge , so Brigadier Bellamy ordered it blown up . German infantry attempted to infiltrate the brigade 's positions throughout the night . At 05 : 30 German armour was detected approaching and the brigade called in close air support from Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter bombers , which destroyed several tanks . The main road bridge , held by 1st RUR , was attacked at 07 : 00 by infantry and two tanks . The attack failed when the tanks were destroyed by the division 's anti @-@ tank guns . Later that day infantry from the 15th Scottish Infantry Division , supported by tanks , had advanced to the divisional area and took over the brigade 's position . At the same time the division was ordered to prepare to advance eastwards from dawn on 26 March . 
 = = = Germany = = = 
 On 26 March the brigade advanced further into Germany , with the 1st RUR and the 12th Devons leading . The only opposition was German rearguard actions , and they reached <unk> by that evening and <unk> the following day . They crossed the Dortmund – Ems Canal at dawn on 2 April , unopposed except for artillery fire . Later that day there was more resistance when they reached <unk> . By 4 April the brigade was moving forward as fast as possible , supported by the 4th ( Armoured ) Battalion , Grenadier Guards , part of the 6th Guards Tank Brigade . <unk> Meer was reached on 10 April , then in the following days <unk> and Lüneburg were captured . By 2 May they had reached the River Elbe . Expecting it to be defended in force , the division attacked at once , trying to catch the defenders unaware . The attack was successful and the river was crossed over a pontoon bridge left intact by the retreating Germans . That afternoon the leading troops of the 3rd Parachute Brigade reached Mecklenburg and made contact with the leading men from the Russian Army advancing from the east . Later that day the brigade reached Wismar on the Baltic Sea , and remained there until 7 May when news was received of the German surrender . 
 = = = Post war = = = 
 At the end of May 1945 , the division was pulled out of Germany and returned to England . It was initially intended to send them to India to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division . The division ’ s advance party , formed around the 5th Parachute Brigade , had already arrived in India . Following the Japanese surrender , all these plans changed . The post @-@ war British Army only needed one airborne division , and the 6th Airborne was chosen to remain on strength . Reinforced by the 2nd Parachute Brigade , the division was sent to the Middle East as the Imperial Strategic Reserve . 
 On 10 October 1945 , the brigade arrived at the port of Haifa , and after disembarking moved to Gaza . After a short period of acclimatisation , the 6th Airlanding Brigade was deployed in the Samaria region , with the brigade headquarters at Lydda airfield . At the same time , the 6th Battalion , Gordon Highlanders , based at Tulkarm , came under the brigade 's command . The first incident in the brigade area was on 31 October , when parties of armed Jews planted explosives on rail lines , which killed four and wounded eight when they exploded . Following attacks on coastguard stations , believed to be by members of the Palmach , over the night of 24 / 25 November , the brigade carried out two operations to search settlements for those responsible . On 29 March 1946 the brigade was relocated to Jerusalem in preparation for leaving the division . On 3 April the 1st Parachute Brigade , which had been assigned to the division , arrived in Palestine . Their arrival made the glider formation surplus to requirements , so on 15 April the brigade was renumbered 31st Independent Infantry Brigade , and was no longer part of the British airborne forces .

 = Schlumbergera = 
 Schlumbergera is a small genus of cacti with six species found in the coastal mountains of south @-@ eastern Brazil . Plants grow on trees or rocks in habitats that are generally shady with high humidity , and can be quite different in appearance from their desert @-@ dwelling cousins . Most species of Schlumbergera have stems which resemble leaf @-@ like pads joined one to the other and flowers which appear from areoles at the joints and tips of the stems . Two species have cylindrical stems more similar to other cacti . In Brazil , the genus is referred to as Flor de Maio ( May flower ) , reflecting the period in which they flower in the Southern Hemisphere . 
 This genus contains the popular house plants known by a variety of names including Christmas Cactus , Thanksgiving Cactus , Crab Cactus and Holiday Cactus , which are Schlumbergera cultivars , and flower in white , pink , yellow , orange , red or purple . ( The Easter Cactus or Whitsun Cactus , which may also be called a Holiday Cactus and has vivid scarlet flowers in the most commonly grown form , is now placed in the genus Hatiora . ) The cultivars of Schlumbergera fall into two main groups : 
 The Truncata Group contains all cultivars with features derived mainly from the species S. truncata : stem segments with pointed teeth ; flowers held more or less horizontally , usually above the horizontal , whose upper side is differently shaped from the lower side ( zygomorphic ) ; and pollen which is yellow . They generally flower earlier than members of the Buckleyi Group and although common names are not applied consistently may be distinguished as Thanksgiving Cactus , Crab Cactus or Claw Cactus . 
 The Buckleyi Group contains all cultivars with at least some features clearly showing inheritance from S. russelliana : stem segments with rounded , more symmetrical teeth ; more or less symmetrical ( regular ) flowers which hang down , below the horizontal ; and pollen which is pink . They generally flower later than members of the Truncata Group and are more likely to be called Christmas Cactus . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Botanist Charles Lemaire ( 1801 @-@ 1871 ) gave the name Schlumbergera to this genus in 1858 , honouring Frédéric Schlumberger ( 1823 @-@ 1893 ) , French cactus and other succulent plant collector . 
 = = Description = = 
 In the wild , the species of Schlumbergera grow either on trees ( epiphytic ) or on rocks ( <unk> ) and can form sizeable shrubs with woody bases ; a height of up to 1 @.@ 2 m ( 4 ft ) has been reported for one species ( S. opuntioides ) . They are leafless , the green stems acting as photosynthetic organs . The stems are composed of segments , which take one of two forms . In most species the segments are strongly flattened ( cladodes ) , being made up of a central core with two ( or more rarely three ) " wings " . Special structures characteristic of cacti , called " areoles " , then occur at the ends of the segments of the stem . In two species the stems are less flattened , more cylinder @-@ shaped , and the areoles are arranged in a more or less spiral pattern all over the segments . In both cases , the areoles , which may have wool and bristles , are where the flower buds appear . 
 The flowers either hang downwards and are almost regular ( radially symmetrical or actinomorphic ) or , as in most species , are held more or less horizontally with the higher side of the flower different from the lower side ( radially asymmetrical or zygomorphic ) . In those species whose flowers are held up , their angle with the horizontal is relatively constant and is characteristic of the species . Each flower has 20 – 30 tepals . The outer tepals – those closer to the base of the flower – are short and unconnected , and spread out or curve backwards . The inner tepals – those towards the tip of the flower – are longer and become progressively more fused together at the base to form a floral tube . In some species the difference between the outer and inner tepals creates the appearance of a " flower within a flower " . The flowers produce nectar in a chamber at the base of the floral tube . 
 The many stamens are arranged in two series , which is a distinctive characteristic of the genus . The inner stamens are fused at the base to form a short tubular structure . The outer stamens arise from along the floral tube . The style is usually dark red and has a stigma with 6 – 8 lobes ; the style plus stigma is roughly the same length as the stamens . If the flower is fertilized , a fleshy fruit forms , either smooth or with ribs . The brown or black seeds are about 1 mm in diameter . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The genus is one of a small number belonging to a group of cacti classified as the tribe Rhipsalideae . Species of cacti belonging to this group are quite distinct in appearance and habit from most other cacti since they grow on trees or rocks as epiphytes or <unk> . Although the species are easy to identify as members of the Rhipsalideae , for many years there was confusion as to how they should be divided into genera . This confusion extended to Schlumbergera , whose complicated taxonomic history has been detailed by McMillan and Horobin . The modern genus Schlumbergera was created by Charles Lemaire in 1858 . The name commemorates Frédéric Schlumberger , who had a collection of cacti at his chateau near Rouen . Lemaire placed only one species in his new genus – a plant discovered in Brazil in 1837 which had been named Epiphyllum <unk> by William J. Hooker . Lemaire renamed it Schlumbergera epiphylloides ( under the current rules of botanical nomenclature it should have been called Schlumbergera russelliana , which is its current name ) . 
 Lemaire noted the similarity of his Schlumbergera epiphylloides to a species first described as Epiphyllum truncatum by Adrian Hardy Haworth in 1819 , but did not accept that the two species should be included in the same genus . In 1890 , Karl Moritz Schumann created the new genus Zygocactus , transferring Epiphyllum truncatum to Zygocactus truncatus . Although he later placed it back in Epiphyllum , abandoning Zygocactus , the generic name Zygocactus continued to be widely used . 
 In 1913 , Nathaniel Britton and Joseph Rose followed Lemaire in keeping Schlumbergera russelliana and Zygocactus truncatus in separate genera . ( They also transferred the Easter Cactus – now Hatiora gaertneri – to Schlumbergera as S. gaertneri , initiating a lasting confusion between these two genera . ) 
 In 1953 , Reid Venable Moran placed both Schlumbergera russelliana and Zygocactus truncatus in the genus Schlumbergera . Other species were added later by David Hunt , including those formerly placed in Epiphyllanthus , to form the modern total of six full species and a number of hybrids . 
 = = = Synonymy = = = 
 The following genera are now synonyms of Schlumbergera ( i.e. they have no species not moved into Schlumbergera ) : 
 Epiphyllanthus <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> ( nom. <unk> . ) 
 Zygocactus K.Schum. 
 <unk> <unk> & Kreuz . ( <unk> var . ) 
 Epiphyllum <unk> but not Epiphyllum Haw . 
 The case of Epiphyllum is complex . In 1753 Carl Linnaeus created the genus Cactus . As more species were discovered this proved too broad , and new genera were set up to subdivide the cacti . The genus Epiphyllum was created in 1812 by Haworth , based on Linnaeus 's Cactus <unk> . In 1831 Johann Link created the genus Phyllocactus based on the same species . Following Ludwig Pfeiffer in 1837 , the European tradition was to use Phyllocactus for epiphytic cacti with large regular flowers and Epiphyllum for the irregular @-@ flowered species now called Schlumbergera truncata . Under modern rules , Phyllocactus is an illegitimate name , as is Epiphyllum in the sense of Pfeiffer ; thus Epiphyllum <unk> is a synonym of Schlumbergera . The true genus Epiphyllum <unk> now has around 19 species .

 = = Distribution , habitat and ecology = = 
 Schlumbergera occurs only in the coastal mountains of south @-@ east Brazil , in the states of São Paulo , Rio de Janeiro , Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo . Sites where it has been found range from close to the Tropic of Capricorn northwards to 20 ° S , i.e. in the southernmost part of the tropics . Plants grow at altitudes from 700 metres ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) in the case of S. truncata to 2 @,@ 780 metres ( 9 @,@ 120 ft ) in the case of S. microsphaerica , either in the coastal moist forests or in rocky areas . The natural distribution of Schlumbergera species has become confused because European cultivars were deliberately introduced into some areas , including the Serra dos <unk> National Park , by the Brazilian Agricultural Department , to compensate for over @-@ collecting of wild plants . 
 Because of their height and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean , the coastal mountains produce high altitude moist forests – warm moist air is forced upwards into higher , colder locations where it condenses . Schlumbergera species grow in habitats which are generally relatively cool , shaded and of high humidity . David Hunt describes collecting specimens in conditions of cloud , drizzle and overnight temperatures down to − 4 ° C ( 25 ° F ) . Plants are epiphytic or lithophytic , growing on moss @-@ covered tree branches or in rock crevices , often in small pockets of substrate formed from decayed leaves and other vegetation . S. microsphaerica is found at higher altitudes , above 2 @,@ 200 metres ( 7 @,@ 200 ft ) , in barren rocky habitats , and tolerates higher light levels . 
 The flowers of Schlumbergera have adaptations for pollination by hummingbirds : tubular flowers with abundant nectar , and colours towards the red end of the spectrum . Most species require cross @-@ pollination to set seed . The exceptions are S. kautskyi and S. microsphaerica ; as noted above , the latter is found at higher altitudes where humming birds may be absent or less common . 
 The fruits of Schlumbergera do not open spontaneously when ripe , and appear to be adapted for distribution by birds , which eat the seeds and pulp contained in the fruit . Birds have been observed removing seeds which had stuck to their beaks by rubbing them on tree branches , where the seeds might be able to germinate . Segments may also break off from the stems and take root , thus enabling plants to propagate vegetatively . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 = = = History = = = 
 Schlumbergera truncata was in cultivation in Europe by 1818 , and S. russelliana was introduced in 1839 . The two species were deliberately crossed in England by W. Buckley resulting in the hybrid now called S. × buckleyi , first recorded in 1852 . By the 1860s , a substantial number of cultivars ( cultivated varieties ) were available in a range of colours and habits , and were used as ornamental plants in " stoves " ( heated greenhouses ) and in houses , where they were popular for their autumn and winter flowering . Many cultivars were selected seedlings of S. truncata , but at least three S. × buckleyi hybrids were available , of which one , now called S. ' Buckleyi ' , is thought to be the original Christmas Cactus . By the early part of the 20th century , the genus had become less popular , and many of the early cultivars were lost . 
 From around the 1950s onwards , breeding resumed in Europe , North America , Australia and New Zealand . New plants were produced by crossing among the species and existing cultivars of S. truncata , S. russelliana and the hybrid S. × buckleyi . Treatments which induced mutations were also used . The result was a wide range of flower colours which had not been available before , including the first true yellow to be sold commercially , S. ' Gold Charm ' ( which was a sterile triploid ) . Breeders aimed for plants which grew strongly , were upright at the point of sale rather than pendulous , had many flowers or buds , and were adapted to living as house plants . 
 In the 1980s the species S. orssichiana was also used in crosses . The hybrid of S. truncata and S. orssichiana has been named S. × reginae or S. Reginae Group ; one of the first cultivars was S. ' Bristol Queen ' . S. opuntioides crosses have also been made , but have not resulted in commercially available cultivars . 
 = = = Modern cultivars = = = 
 McMillan and Horobin have listed hundreds of modern European , North American and Australian cultivars , which they put into a number of cultivar groups : 
 The Truncata Group contains all cultivars with mainly S. truncata characteristics : stem segments with pointed teeth ( dentate ) ; zygomorphic flowers held more or less horizontally , usually above the horizontal ; and pollen which is yellow . 
 The Buckleyi Group contains all cultivars with at least some features clearly showing inheritance from S. russelliana : stem segments with rounded , more symmetrical teeth ( crenate ) ; more regular flowers which hang down , below the horizontal ; and pollen which is pink . There is considerable variation within this Group ; McMillan and Horobin introduced subcategories : " TB " for those more like S. truncata and " BT " for those more like the classic S. × buckleyi , with " B " reserved for the first generation ( F1 ) S. × buckleyi hybrids . 
 The Reginae Group contains cultivars known to be derived from hybrids with S. orssichiana . 
 The Exotica Group is used for the small number of hybrids involving S. opuntioides . 
 Attempts have also been made to classify cultivars by colour . A difficulty is that the flowers of many cultivars exhibit different colours depending on the temperature during bud formation and growth . In particular , temperatures below 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) produce pink tones in otherwise white and yellow cultivars , and deepen the colour in pink and red cultivars . The availability of iron to the plant has also been suggested to affect flower colour . 
 In the United States , cultivars are propagated in large numbers for sale before Thanksgiving Day ( the fourth Thursday in November ) . In Europe , plants are mainly sold later in the year , in the period before Christmas . A single Dutch grower ( de Vries of <unk> , the Netherlands ) was reported in 1989 as producing 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 plants per year . 
 = = = Common names = = = 
 Plants are offered for sale under a variety of common names . The earliest English common name was " Christmas Cactus " . In Europe , where plants are largely produced for sale in the period before Christmas , this remains the most widely used common name in many languages for cultivars of all groups ( e.g. <unk> in German , Cactus de Noël in French , and <unk> de Navidad in Spanish ) . This is also the name used in Canada . In the United States , where plants are produced for the Thanksgiving holiday in November , the name " Thanksgiving Cactus " is used ; " Christmas Cactus " may then be restricted to cultivars of the Buckleyi Group , particularly the very old cultivars such as ' Buckleyi ' . The name " Crab Cactus " ( referring to the clawed ends of the stems ) is also used for the Truncata Group . " Link Cactus " is another common name , describing the way that the stems of the genus as a whole are made up of linked segments . The name " Chain Cactus " is common in New Zealand , and may also refer to Hatiora species . 
 The Easter Cactus or Whitsun Cactus is now placed in the genus Hatiora , but was at one time included in Schlumbergera ( or one of its synonyms ) . The name " Holiday Cactus " has been used to include both Schlumbergera and Hatiora cultivars . 
 = = = Care of cultivars = = = 
 When grown as house plants , Schlumbergera cultivars are said to be relatively easy to care for . McMillan and Horobin describe in detail their cultivation in both commercial and domestic conditions . Their specific recommendations include : 
 Growing medium - Free @-@ draining , humus @-@ rich , somewhat acid growing media are used for commercial production , such as a mixture of peat or <unk> and an inert material such as grit , sharp sand or polystyrene beads . It is recommended that plants should be grown in relatively small pots ; half @-@ height pots are suitable . 
 Watering - They are more tolerant of drought than many house plants , but can be damaged by both under- and over @-@ watering . Keeping the growing medium just moist throughout the year avoids either extreme . 
 Light - They can be damaged by exposure to more than small amounts of sunlight . Members of the Buckleyi Group , such as the old @-@ fashioned Christmas Cactus with pendant flowers , are more tolerant of high light levels than members of the Truncata Group , such as most of the modern cultivars . Too much light causes stems to take on a reddish colouration ; however , very low light levels will prevent flowering . Day length is important in controlling flowering ; continuous darkness for at least 12 hours is necessary to induce bud formation . A period of about 8 days with 16 hours of darkness at 16 ° C ( 61 ° F ) has been shown to cause flower buds to form . Lower temperatures slow this process . The advice sometimes given to withhold water to produce flower buds has been shown to be incorrect . 
 Propagation - Both commercially and in the home , propagation can be achieved by using short pieces of stem , one to three segments long , twisted off rather than cut . Cuttings are allowed to dry for 1 – 7 days , forming a callus at the broken end , and then rooted in an open growing medium . Temperatures above 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) and up to 27 ° C ( 81 ° F ) in long day / short night conditions speed rooting . 
 = = = Pests and diseases = = = 
 In cultivation , these plants have been described as " remarkably free from pests and diseases " . Two significant insect pests are aphids on young shoots , buds and flowers , and root mealybugs which attack below soil level . Stems and roots can be rotted by diseases caused by fungi and similar organisms ; these include infections by species of Fusarium ( a fungus ) , and Phytophthora and <unk> ( both water moulds ) . Approved chemical treatments can be used in the case of insect attack or these diseases . 
 Aphids , mealybugs and other invertebrate pests can spread viruses . Symptoms vary with the species , but a loss of vigour is usual . Cactus virus X has been isolated from S. truncata . There is no treatment for virus diseases ; it is recommended that infected plants be destroyed .

 " Got the Life " is a song written and recorded by American band Korn for their third studio album , Follow the Leader which was released as the album 's second single on November 23 , 1998 . It was recorded in April 1998 at NRG Recording Studios . The band decided they would release the song as a promotional single after each member found that there was something " special " about the song . The single had " phenomenal success " , and its music video was requested more than any other video on MTV 's TRL , making it the first officially " retired " music video . 
 " Got the Life " did not receive much attention in the music press ; however , the song was rewarded a gold certification in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association . It peaked at number one on the Canadian RPM Rock / Alternative Chart chart , as well as number fifteen on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number seventeen on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart . 
 = = Background and release = = 
 " Got the Life " was recorded in April 1998 at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood , California . After recording the song , the group 's members each felt that there was something " special " about the song . Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis claimed that it reminded him of " something you might hear at raves " , which were very popular at the time . Even though they thought that many fans would not appreciate the song , they released it as a promotional single in early August 1998 , before the release of Follow the Leader . " Got the Life " was said by Leah Furman to be " revolved around the mixed blessings of fame . " 
 The single was sent to radio stations on July 24 , 1998 , and has been released five times . The single 's first release was on August 10 , 1998 , where it was released with two versions in the United States . The single contains different mixes of the song , including " Deejay Punk @-@ Roc Remix " and the instrumental " D.O.S.E. ' s <unk> Remix . " The single also apprehends B @-@ sides and remixes to earlier songs . Stephen Thomas Erlewine reviewed the single , giving it two out of five stars , and noting that " the ' Deejay Punk @-@ Roc Remix ' is pretty good , but the instrumental is of negligible worth . The second part of the single is backed with ' I Can Remember ' plus ' Good God ( <unk> ! vs. Such A Surge Remix ) ' . The single was also released in Australia , and in the United Kingdom twice . The single was considered to have had " phenomenal success " . 
 = = Music video = = 
 Korn decided to shoot a music video for " Got the Life " after the reception from fans and employees at NRG Recording Studios was very positive . The music video 's concept was by the band 's bassist Reginald " Fieldy " Arvizu . Their managers advised them to request Joseph Kahn to direct the video . Kahn also was the director for " A.D.I.D.A.S. " music video in 1997 . After asking Kahn to direct their video , he responded saying " That 's the stupidest idea I 've ever heard . " 
 Offended by and against his response , Korn hired McG , director of the band 's music videos from their self @-@ titled debut album — " Blind " , " Shoots and Ladders " , " Clown " , and " Faget " . On January 12 , 1999 , music video was the first video that is considered to be " retired " from MTV 's daily top ten countdown , Total Request Live . MTV 's Total Request Live said the song was the most requested music video " for too long so they had to stop airing it so other artists would have a chance at the coveted number one spot . " The video , however , never actually reached number one ; it peaked at number two . ( In fact , for the majority of its run , it was stuck at third behind videos by N <unk> and Britney Spears ; at the time , Daly jokingly called the # 3 position on the countdown " The Korn Spot " . ) Deuce , the video album where " Got the Life " ' s music video appears on , was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . California rapper WC makes a cameo appearance in the video dancing , along with Fred Durst , Sam Rivers , and Wes Borland of Limp <unk> can be seen in the end of the video .. In an interview with Scuzz in 2013 , Munky confirms that a young Eminem had in fact been an extra on the video and had offered him a demo .

 Allmusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave it two out of five stars , although he stated " it rivaled such previous masterworks as ' A.D.I.D.A.S. ' and ' Shoots and Ladders ' . Their fusion of metal and rap was stronger than ever , boasting their best rhythm tracks to date . Which is good , since the B @-@ sides of the ' Got the Life ' singles were devoted to remixes . " 
 " Got the Life " became Korn 's first entry on Billboard 's Mainstream Rock Songs and Alternative Songs charts , peaking at number fifteen and number seventeen , respectively . The song peaked at number twenty @-@ six in Australia , and shipments of a CD single have surpassed 35 @,@ 000 units . " Got the Life " ' s music video debuted at number eight on MTV 's Total Request Live , on September 17 , 1998 . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Got the Life " is three minutes and forty @-@ five seconds long . It is the shortest song on Follow the Leader , and like the album the single was produced by Steve Thompson and Toby Wright , and was mixed by Brendan O 'Brien . " Got the Life ( Deejay Punk @-@ Roc remix ) " was mixed by Deejay Punk @-@ Roc and Jonathan Davis , and was recorded at <unk> Funk Research Department and Liverpool , England . The D.O.S.E. ' s <unk> remix was mixed by D.O.S.E. in courtesy of Mercury Records . 
 The song starts off with a single percussion beat , leading into the refrain riff , with a triple guitar overdub . When the verses emerge , lead singer Jonathan Davis begins singing with the lyrical line " Hate , something , sometime , someway , something kicked on the front floor . " Korn performed the song with the following members : Jonathan Davis performing vocals , Brian " Head " Welch and James " Munky " Shaffer performing guitars , Reginald " Fieldy " Arvizu , performing on the bass guitar , and David Silveria on the drum kit . They produced a sound described by employees of Allmusic as having a style of alternative metal , heavy metal , and rap – metal genres . 
 In a 2013 interview with Scuzz , Jonathan Davis revealed that " Got The Life " originally contained an audio sample at the very beginning - a piece of dialogue spoken by actor Dom DeLuise in the 1974 film Blazing Saddles . Warner Brothers would not allow its usage , however , so it was removed prior to the song 's release .

 = Proposition Infinity = 
 " Proposition Infinity " ( " Proposition ∞ " ) is the fourth episode of the sixth season of the animated sitcom Futurama , and originally aired July 8 , 2010 on Comedy Central . In the episode , Amy Wong and Bender fall in love and begin a culturally taboo " robosexual " relationship . After facing anti @-@ robosexual sentiments from society , they elect to get married and advocate to legalize robosexual marriage through " Proposition Infinity . " 
 The episode was written by Michael Rowe and directed by Crystal Chesney @-@ Thompson . " Proposition Infinity " served as a satire of the controversy over same @-@ sex marriage and California Proposition 8 ( generally referred to as " Proposition 8 " ) , which banned same @-@ sex marriage in California in November 2008 . The title of the episode is derived from Proposition 8 , turning the 8 sideways to create the symbol for infinity ( ∞ ) , hence " Proposition ∞ " . Though the episode satirizes arguments for same @-@ sex marriage , it leans favorably toward the idea of allowing same @-@ sex marriage . The theme of the episode revisits the social taboo of robosexual relationships presented in earlier episodes " Space Pilot 3000 " and " I Dated a Robot " . Openly gay actor George Takei of Star Trek fame , who married his partner in California during the debate over Proposition 8 , returns as a guest star in the series . 
 " Proposition Infinity " received mostly positive reviews from critics . Co @-@ creator David X. Cohen named it as one of his favorite episodes of the sixth season . 
 = = Plot = = 
 While bailing Bender out of jail after he was arrested for vandalism , Amy flirts with several inmates . Infuriated at her obsession with " bad boys " , Kif breaks up with her . The break @-@ up severely upsets Amy , and to make her feel better , Leela , Fry , and Bender take her to Forbidden Planet Hollywood . Bender mocks Amy all night , insulting and infuriating her , but this leads the two to have sex because of her interest in " bad boys " . After this , Amy and Bender discover a mutual attraction for each other and enter into a " robosexual " relationship , which is taboo in the 31st century . Because it is frowned upon , they keep quiet about their relationship , even to their friends and co @-@ workers . The co @-@ workers grow suspicious , but think little of it . 
 However , during a mission , Amy and Bender are discovered cuddling together . Professor Farnsworth immediately disapproves of this , but the rest of the crew accepts Bender and Amy 's relationship . The couple is thankful , since Amy knows that her family would disapprove . However , the Professor immediately informs Amy 's parents and then calls Reverend Preacherbot to deal with Bender , who is sent to a robosexual rehabilitation camp . While at her parent 's ranch , where her parents continuously introduce her to non @-@ robot suitors , Amy is saved by Fry , who poses as her new non @-@ robot beau to get her parents off her back . The crew then rescues Bender from the rehabilitation camp . At the Planet Express building , Bender proposes to Amy . The Professor reminds them that robosexual marriage is illegal in New New York . To fight against this , Bender and Amy launch a campaign for the legalization of robosexual marriage . 
 They launch " Proposition Infinity " ( " Proposition ∞ " ) which , in days before the election , slumps in the polls . Amy loses hope , but Bender says that they will win due to his upcoming debate against Professor Farnsworth , the leader of the Proposition Infinity opposition . At the debate ( moderated by the head of George Takei ) Bender gives a heartfelt speech , which the audience applauds . The Professor follows with his rebuttal , relaying a story from his past where he was in love with a fellow scientist named Eunice whom he later discovered in bed with a robot , breaking his heart . Because of this , the Professor hates <unk> . This does not impress the audience . Frustrated by the audience 's lack of sympathy for his cause , he accidentally admits that Eunice was actually a robot . Having suppressed the truth for so long , Farnsworth reveals that the robot 's name was actually Unit and that he caught her in bed with another robot . With his heart broken , he takes his anger out on other <unk> . After admitting the truth , the Professor withdraws his argument , now fully in support of Proposition Infinity . The next day the proposition is approved . Amy is ecstatic , but Bender quickly dumps her when he realizes marriage means that he must be monogamous . Amy is dejected , but Kif wins back her heart by adopting a bad boy persona and the two ride off together on a motorcycle .

 The episode was inspired by the controversy that arose from California Proposition 8 in the United States during 2008 and was written by Michael Rowe . The episode was directed by Crystal Chesney @-@ Thompson . George Takei returns as a guest star , voicing himself . 
 According to Cohen , the writing team 's approach when using pop culture references as an episode 's main subject is to modify them into futuristic versions to avoid being dated , noting that being a science fiction show , " some topics are probably not going to be around by the time the show airs . " In particular , with " Proposition Infinity " , they paid specific attention to developing the plot in a way that would " history @-@ proof " the episode and avoid being over @-@ politicized or " preachy . " When taking on " real " social issues in the show , Cohen stated that one of their methods of keeping controversy from overwhelming the episode is to " <unk> " issues until the audience is unlikely to have developed a strong opinion one way or another about the presented conflict . This was the method used for " Proposition Infinity " , as the team felt that most viewers would not have a strong opinion for or against robot and human intermarriage , thus lightening the potentially polarizing nature of the source material . 
 = = Theme and cultural references = = 
 " Proposition Infinity " was inspired by the political battle over California Proposition 8 in the United States and heavily satirizes the controversy over same @-@ sex marriage . The title is a reference to California Proposition 8 with the " 8 " sideways , thus becoming the symbol of infinity ( ∞ ) . The camp where Bender is being reprogrammed parodies conversion therapy camps for homosexuals . The episode also satirizes the people against same @-@ sex marriage , and in particular , the National Organization for Marriage ( NOM ) ; the episode depicts an anti @-@ Proposition Infinity advertisement ( " No on Infinity " ) , which is a direct parody of NOM 's 2009 " Gathering Storm " campaign . Many of the jokes in the episode were inspired by the actual vote regarding Proposition 8 and similar legislative debates over same @-@ sex marriage throughout the United States , with several critics noting that the episode was favorable toward same @-@ sex marriage . 
 Openly gay actor George Takei guest stars in this episode , moderating the Proposition Infinity debate . Takei , a frequent guest star in the series , is an outspoken LGBT activist and marriage equality spokesperson . Takei married his partner , Brad Altman , on June 17 , 2008 when same @-@ sex marriage was legal in California . Despite the passing of Proposition 8 in November of that same year , which banned same @-@ sex marriage in California , the California Supreme Court ruled that it did not affect same @-@ sex marriages entered into before its passing , leaving Takei and Altman 's marriage still legal and valid . 
 The episode revisits the concept of <unk> as a social taboo in the future society depicted in Futurama and is more explicit in its analogy to prejudice and stigma surrounding homosexuality . The stigmatization of <unk> and the term " robosexual " were first mentioned in the series pilot " Space Pilot 3000 " . The issue is expanded upon in more detail in the season 3 episode " I Dated a Robot " in which Fry dates a robot Lucy Liu , to the disapproval of the other characters . Co @-@ producer David X. Cohen noted that the writing team had tried to maintain robosexual relationships as a taboo throughout the series .

 " Proposition Infinity " originally aired July 8 , 2010 on Comedy Central .

In interviews leading up to the premiere of season six , David X. Cohen stated that he considers this one of his favorite episodes of Futurama 's sixth season . 
 " Proposition Infinity " received mostly positive reviews from critics . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote : " This is the series I 've been missing for years . It was goofy , spastic , over @-@ stuffed , occasionally cruel , and bizarrely sincere . " He graded the episode A- , praising the " No on Infinity " ad parody and reappearances of George Takei and <unk> in particular . Sean Gandert of Paste wrote : " I ’ d like to see them lay off the contemporary commentary episodes for a bit , but other than that it was exactly what any fan of the show would hope for . " Danny Gallagher of TVSquad stated that the episode 's " robotic take on the needless hysteria and blatant <unk> [ sic ] of gay marriage was not only steeped in satiric goodness , but it was downright hilarious . " He felt that the episode 's writing was an improvement over the previous episodes in the season and that it " really used the storied and rich history of the characters to its advantage . " In particular , Gallagher praised Takei 's cameo as one of the episode 's funniest , even stating it to be one of the series ' best . Alasdair Wilkins of io9 also praised the episode , calling it " a triumph for the new Futurama , and just the sort of episode that leaves me convinced that the show 's revival was completely worthwhile . " Michelle Castillo of Television on Today enjoyed the attack on California Proposition 8 , stating that the episode " poked fun at the issues in the unique way that only ' Futurama ' can pull off . " 
 Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a more mixed review , stating that he felt the relationship between Bender and Amy was only used to serve the purposes of the story and felt unnatural compared to the relationship between Fry and the Lucy Liu @-@ bot in the similarly themed season 3 episode " I Dated a Robot " . He found the jokes funny , stating that they " delivered plenty of hilarious observations regarding gay marriage and the movements surrounding it , but the story was incredibly hollow . "

 The 2015 Vuelta a España was a three @-@ week Grand Tour cycling race . The race was the 70th edition of the Vuelta a España and took place principally in Spain , although two stages took place partly or wholly in Andorra , and was the 22nd race in the 2015 UCI World Tour . The 3 @,@ 358 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @,@ 086 @.@ 6 mi ) race included 21 stages , beginning in Marbella on 22 August 2015 and finishing in Madrid on 13 September . It was won by Fabio Aru ( Astana Pro Team ) , with Joaquim Rodríguez ( Team Katusha ) second and Rafał Majka ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) third . 
 The early leaders of the race were Esteban Chaves ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) and Tom Dumoulin ( Giant – Alpecin ) , who exchanged the leader 's red jersey several times during the first ten days of racing , with both riders winning summit finishes in the first week . Aru took over the race lead following the mountainous Stage 11 , which took place entirely within Andorra . He kept his lead for five stages as the race entered the mountains of northern Spain , but lost it to Rodríguez on Stage 16 . Dumoulin took the lead back on Stage 17 – the race 's only individual time trial – with Aru three seconds behind in second place . Aru attacked throughout the final stages and , on the penultimate day , finally dropped Dumoulin , who fell to sixth place overall . Aru therefore took the first Grand Tour victory of his career . 
 The points classification was decided during the final stage and was won by Alejandro Valverde ( Movistar Team ) , while Rodriguez won the combination classification . The mountains classification was won by Omar Fraile ( Caja Rural – Seguros RGA ) . Dumoulin won the combativity award , while Movistar won the team prize . 
 = = Teams = = 
 The seventeen UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to attend the race . The organiser of the Vuelta , <unk> , was also able to invite five UCI Professional Continental teams – the second tier of professional cycling teams – as wildcards . These were announced on 20 March 2015 . Caja Rural – Seguros RGA , the only Spanish @-@ registered Professional Continental team , was one of those invited , along with two French teams , Cofidis and Team Europcar . MTN – Qhubeka were invited for the second consecutive year after also securing their first ever entry into the Tour de France . The final team to be invited was Colombia . One prominent team to miss out on an entry was UnitedHealthcare . 
 The team presentation took place in <unk> on the evening before the first stage . The number of riders allowed per squad was nine , therefore the start list contained a total of 198 riders . The riders represented 37 different countries , with the largest numbers coming from France ( 30 ) , Spain ( 27 ) and Italy ( 20 ) . The average age of riders in the Vuelta was 29 @.@ 13 years , ranging from the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Matej Mohorič ( Cannondale – Garmin ) to the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Haimar Zubeldia ( Trek Factory Racing ) . 
 The teams entering the race were : 
 = = Pre @-@ race favorites = = 
 The top four riders from the 2015 Tour de France all chose to start the Vuelta . These were Chris Froome ( Team Sky ) , Nairo Quintana and Alejandro Valverde ( both Movistar Team ) and Vincenzo Nibali ( Astana ) , all of whom had previously won Grand Tours . The most notable absentee from among the general classification contenders was Alberto Contador ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , the winner of the 2014 Vuelta . Oleg Tinkov , the owner of the Tinkoff @-@ Saxo team , had challenged Contador , Froome , Nibali and Quintana to attempt to ride all three Grand Tours in 2015 ; none of the riders took up the challenge . Froome , Nibali and Quintana all declined to ride the Giro and , as Contador was attempting to win both the Giro d 'Italia and the Tour , he did not aim to ride the Vuelta . Valverde and Nibali were the only two previous winners of the race to start the 2015 edition . 
 Froome , who had been second in the 2011 and 2014 <unk> , had had a strong season , with victories in the Vuelta a Andalucía , the Critérium du Dauphiné and the Tour de France . He was attempting to become the first rider since Bernard Hinault in 1978 to win both the Tour and the Vuelta in the same season , though it was expected that he would be tired following his victory in the Tour . The individual time trial was expected to favour Froome , who is strong in the discipline . Before the race , however , Froome was uncertain about his form and his ability to win the race . Quintana 's only stage race victory of the season had come in the Tirreno – Adriatico , but he had performed strongly in the Alps in the Tour 's final stages and the mountainous route of the Vuelta was expected to suit him . 
 Vincenzo Nibali , who had won the Vuelta in 2010 , had struggled in the opening stages of the Tour , but had recovered to take a stage victory in the final week . The Astana team also included Fabio Aru and Mikel Landa , second and third respectively at the Giro d 'Italia ; while this made a strong team it was unclear which rider would be favoured by the team and given the assistance of his teammates . There was a similar situation at Movistar , as Valverde , who had won the Vuelta in 2009 and had finished on the podium on four other occasions , was also in strong form and was well suited to the course . Also among the general classification contenders were Joaquim Rodríguez ( Team Katusha ) , Rafał Majka ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) and Tejay van Garderen ( BMC Racing Team ) . 
 Other notable riders to take part in the race included several sprinters . One of these was Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , four times the winner of the points classification in the Tour de France and winner of three stages in the 2011 Vuelta , who was preparing for the World Championships road race the following month . Sagan was considered particularly strong on the easier uphill finishes in the first week . John Degenkolb ( Giant – Alpecin ) had won four stages and the points classification in 2014 as well as five stages in 2012 . Nacer Bouhanni ( Cofidis ) , who had crashed out of the Tour , was expected to compete with Degenkolb in the flat sprints .

 The first announcement of the route for the 2015 Vuelta a España came in October 2014 , when Javier Guillén , the race director , announced that the first stage would take place in Puerto Banús near Marbella on 22 August . It had been decided that the stage would be either an individual time trial or a team time trial . More news came the following month , when Guillén revealed that he had been involved in conversations with Chris Froome and had promised him that the race would include a fairly flat individual time trial of around 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) . He also said that the race would feature " explosive finals and summit finishes " . The official route announcement came on 10 January 2015 in Torremolinos , along the coast from the start of the first stage in Puerto Banús . 
 The first five stages took place in and around Andalusia in southern Spain ; the 2014 Vuelta had also started there . The first stage was a team time trial along the coast from Puerto Banús to Marbella . The next four stages were fairly flat , although Stage 2 finished on a moderately difficult climb . The sixth stage started in Córdoba and finished in Sierra de Cazorla in Jaén on another moderately difficult climb . The seventh stage then returned to Andalusia for the first major difficulty of the race : the first @-@ category summit finish at La <unk> . The route then continued along the eastern coast of Spain , with a medium @-@ mountain seventh stage and another first @-@ category summit finish at <unk> on Stage 9 . There was one more medium @-@ mountain stage on Stage 10 , taking the riders into the Province of Castellón . This was followed by a transfer that took the riders into Andorra for a three @-@ day spell , beginning with the first rest day . The eleventh stage took place entirely in Andorra ; though it was only 138 kilometres ( 86 mi ) in length , it included six categorised climbs , including a summit finish , and was described by Eusebio <unk> ( the manager of the Movistar team ) as " the toughest Vuelta stage that he has seen in more than 30 years " . Stage 12 took the riders back into Spain for a fairly flat stage , before three consecutive stages with summit finishes . These took place in the mountains of Cantabria and Asturias and were followed by the race 's second rest day . The final week of the race included no summit finishes : the first stage was a 38 @.@ 7 @-@ kilometre ( 24 @.@ 0 mi ) individual time trial in Burgos and was then followed by three mixed stages that took the riders nearer to the final stage of the race , a sprint stage in Madrid . For the first time , the race organisers also held a women 's race on the same day as the final stage , using the same circuit . This race – called La Madrid Challenge by La Vuelta – was won by Shelley Olds . 
 The 2015 Vuelta included nine summit finishes , none of which had previously been used in the race . Unusually , the principal difficulties of the race came in the first two weeks , including all nine summit finishes . It was therefore expected that the climbers would need to attack early in the race , in order to build up a significant lead ahead of the lengthy time trial on Stage 17 . The race organisers also hoped to encourage sprinters to take part by including seven fairly flat stages . 
 Each road stage ( that is , all the stages except the team time trial and the individual time trial ) included an intermediate sprint . This was a point where the leading riders in the stage were awarded points in the points classification and time bonuses in the general classification . Many of the stages also included climbs that were categorised by the race organisers according to their difficulty ; the leading riders over each of these climbs were awarded points in the mountains classification , with the most difficult climbs earning the most points . 
 In the days before the beginning of the race , there was controversy over the first stage . On arriving at the start , the teams discovered that the route used a variety of road surfaces , crossed sandy sections and included several ramps . As a result , the race organisers decided to neutralise the stage : the teams therefore competed only for the stage victory and for the team classification , not for the general classification . 
 = = Race overview = = 
 The team time trial was won by BMC Racing Team and Peter Velits took the red jersey as the first rider across the line . Since the stage had been neutralised for the general classification , all 198 riders began the second stage on the same time . The stage finished on a moderate climb , where Esteban Chaves ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) attacked early and took both the stage victory and the lead of the race . A major crash in the final 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) brought down several riders and most riders in the peloton ( the main group ) were held up , including Fabio Aru and Vincenzo Nibali ( Astana ) . Aru quickly rejoined the peloton ; Nibali was forced to chase for a long time . After the stage , a video emerged of Nibali holding on to his team car as it accelerated him back to the peloton . Nibali was therefore fined and excluded from the race . 
 The next stage was a moderately difficult stage that ended in a bunch sprint . Peter Sagan won his first Grand Tour stage in over two years ahead of Nacer Bouhanni ( Cofidis ) and John Degenkolb ( Giant @-@ Alpecin ) . The fourth stage again included an uphill finish . This stage was also decided in a sprint finish , this time won by Alejandro Valverde . Sagan , who came second , took over the lead of the points classification . A third consecutive bunch sprint came on the fifth stage , which ended on a slight incline . The relatively straightforward stage was won by Caleb Ewan ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) , who was riding his first Grand Tour , ahead of Degenkolb and Sagan . There were splits in the peloton at the finish ; Chaves lost six seconds to Tom Dumoulin ( Giant – Alpecin ) , who therefore took over the red jersey of the race leader by one second . This lead did not last long . The sixth stage finished on another moderate climb . Chaves again attacked early in the climb and took his second stage victory , with Dan Martin ( Cannondale – Garmin ) second and Dumoulin third . Chaves therefore took back the red jersey . 
 The seventh stage was the most significant uphill finish of the race so far , finishing on the climb of the Alto de <unk> . It was won by Bert @-@ Jan Lindeman ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) from the breakaway . Most of the general classification favourites finished together , though Fabio Aru gained seven seconds in the final kilometre and Chris Froome lost nearly half a minute . The following stage was a moderately difficult stage : it was too difficult for the pure sprinters to reach the finish line with the main group of riders , but not difficult enough to create gaps between those riding for the overall victory . The most notable event was a large crash 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) from the finish . Four riders were immediately forced to withdraw from the race with injuries , including Dan Martin , who had been in the top ten . The stage was won in a reduced bunch sprint by Jasper Stuyven ( Trek Factory Racing ) , who had been among the riders injured in the earlier crash . He was forced to withdraw from the race after the stage with a broken scaphoid . Stage 9 ended with a difficult climb . There was a series of attacks on the early part of the mountain , with many riders dropped from the lead group . Tom Dumoulin eventually took a solo win in the stage , two seconds ahead of Chris Froome , and took back the red jersey as Chaves lost significant time . Froome had originally been dropped , but rode at a steady tempo and came close to the stage victory . Stage 10 , the final stage before the first rest day , ended in another bunch sprint , which was won by Kristian Sbaragli ( MTN – Qhubeka ) . 
 The eleventh stage , the first after the rest day , was the difficult stage in Andorra , with six difficult climbs and almost no flat roads . The stage was won from a breakaway by Mikel Landa ( Astana ) . Fabio Aru , Landa 's teammate , took second place and moved into the race lead . Chris Froome fell from his bike at the beginning of the stage and lost several minutes to Aru ; the following morning it was revealed that he had broken his foot in the fall and he withdrew from the race . Nairo Quintana also lost several minutes on the stage . The following stage , which took the riders from Andorra back into Spain , was won in a sprint by Danny van Poppel ( Trek Factory Racing ) after the day 's breakaway was caught in the final kilometre . Van Poppel won the stage despite puncturing his tyre with 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining . The thirteenth stage – the last one before a series of three consecutive summit finishes – was won from a breakaway by Nelson Oliveira ( Lampre – Merida ) , with no impact on the general classification . 
 The first of the three summit finishes – Stage 14 – was won by Alessandro De Marchi ( BMC Racing Team ) , who had been in the day 's breakaway . Quintana gained several seconds back , while Aru , Rodríguez , Chaves and Majka all gained time on Dumoulin . Rodríguez attacked strongly on the final climb to win Stage 15 and gained time on all his rivals , putting himself just one second behind Aru . Dumoulin lost further time to Aru , Majka and Chaves . The final stage with a summit finish was Stage 16 : it was a difficult stage including seven climbs and was won by Fränk Schleck ( Trek Factory Racing ) . On the final climb , Rodríguez gained two seconds on Aru in the final metres to put himself into the race lead for the final rest day , while Dumoulin lost more time and was nearly two minutes back . 
 After the rest day came the race 's individual time trial . It was won by Dumoulin , who was more than a minute ahead of all the other riders in the race . His time was good enough to put him into the overall race lead . Aru rode strongly , and was only three seconds behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage . Rodríguez lost over three minutes to Dumoulin . Majka also lost significant time to Aru and Dumoulin and fell to fourth place . 
 Following the time trial , there were three mountainous stages , although none of them had a summit finish . All three were won by riders from breakaways . Nicolas Roche ( Sky ) won Stage 18 , beating Haimar Zubeldia ( Trek Factory Racing ) in a two @-@ man sprint . After his team had put pressure on the peloton through the whole stage , Aru attacked Dumoulin six times on the final climb , and Valverde put in three more attacks . Dumoulin , however , did not lose any time and retained his three @-@ second lead . Stage 19 ended with a short , cobbled climb into Ávila . It was won by Alexis Gougeard ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , who had escaped from the breakaway group on the previous climb . The day 's racing also produced another crash : this time Aru fell to the ground . Although he had to make several trips to the medical car , he did not seem seriously injured . At the end of the stage , Dumoulin used his team to put him in a strong position for the cobbled climb and he increased his lead over Aru to six seconds . Stage 20 was the final day of mountainous terrain , including four difficult climbs . It was won by Rubén Plaza ( Lampre @-@ Merida ) after a 117 @-@ kilometre ( 73 mi ) solo breakaway that lasted over three hours . Aru 's Astana team rode hard in the second half of the stage and , with a strong team effort , they were eventually able to drop Dumoulin on the penultimate climb of the day ; he dropped further back on the final climb and lost nearly four minutes , dropping to sixth place overall . Quintana and Majka gained nearly a minute on the other general classification rivals . This meant that Aru took the race lead , with Rodríguez second and Majka third . 
 The final stage of the race was a flat stage that finished in Madrid . It was won in a sprint by Degenkolb . During the stage , Valverde took advantage of a puncture for Rodríguez and won the intermediate sprint to give him the points jersey . Although Aru lost a little time in a split in the peloton at the finish line , the rest of the standings were unchanged . Aru therefore won the race , his first Grand Tour victory .

 The 2015 Vuelta a España included four principal classifications . The first of these was the general classification , which was calculated by adding up each rider 's times on each stage and applying the relevant time bonuses . These were 10 seconds for the stage winner , 6 seconds for the rider in second , and 4 seconds for the rider in third , and 3 , 2 and 1 seconds for the first three riders at each intermediate sprint ; no bonuses were awarded on the time trial stages . The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Vuelta . The rider leading the classification wore a red jersey . 
 The second classification was the points classification . Riders were awarded points for finishing in the top fifteen places on each stage and in the top three at each intermediate sprint . The first rider at each stage finish was awarded 25 points , the second 20 points , the third 16 points , the fourth 14 points , the fifth 12 points , the sixth 10 points , down to 1 point for the rider in fifteenth . At the intermediate sprints , the first three riders won 4 , 2 and 1 points respectively . The rider with the most points won the classification and wore a green jersey . 
 The third classification was the mountains classification . Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs . Stages were categorised as third- , second- , first- and special @-@ category , with the more difficult climbs rated higher . The most difficult climb of the race , the Alto Ermita de Alba on Stage 16 , was given its own category as the Cima Alberto Fernández . Points were awarded for the first riders across the summit of each climb ; the rider with the most accumulated points won the classification and wore a white jersey with blue polka dots . 
 The final individual classification was the combination classification . This was calculated by adding up each rider 's position on the other three individual classifications . The rider with the lowest cumulative score was the winner of the classification and wore a white jersey . 
 The final classification was a team classification . This was calculated by adding together the times of each team 's best three riders on each stage . The team with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the classification . There was also a combativity prize awarded on each stage ; three riders were chosen on each stage by a race jury to recognise the rider " who displayed the most courageous effort " . There was then a public vote to decide which rider should be awarded the prize ; the rider wore a red dossard ( race number ) the following day . An identical procedure took place on the final stage to decide the most combative rider of the whole Vuelta .

Club added that " if anything can help curb the nation 's childhood obesity problem , it is the galvanizing power of Beyoncé Knowles dancing " , and further praised how " [ the ] bunch of cute kids [ were ] doing the Running Man and The Dougie in the cafeteria with Beyoncé . " A writer of Rap @-@ Up described Beyoncé 's dance moves in the video as " hot " . Mike Barthel of The Village Voice described the video as " adorable " and classified it as an " important moment in the relationship between politics and culture " . Barthel also praised the patriotic scene where Beyoncé and the kids wave the American flag , saying that " It doesn 't feel jingoistic , or pandering , or aggressive ; it just feels celebratory , like they are actually kinda happy about America .

 Harry Kizirian ( Armenian : <unk> <unk> ; July 13 , 1925 – September 13 , 2002 ) was an Armenian American member of the United States Marine Corps who served during World War II . Kizirian 's service lasted from February 1944 to February 1946 , during which he spent seventeen months overseas . Kizirian took part in the Battle of Okinawa , where he landed during the first assault wave while heading a Marine fire team . 
 Having been awarded the Navy Cross , the Rhode Island Cross , the Bronze Star with Combat " V " , and the Purple Heart twice , Kizirian is considered one of the most decorated marines of World War II . He is also the most decorated serviceman from Rhode Island . In 1961 he was appointed by John F. Kennedy as the postmaster of Providence , becoming ( at age 36 ) one of the youngest postmasters in the United States . During his <unk> , Kizirian was instrumental in establishing the first automated post office in the country , which made the Providence post office an operational model for the United States and worldwide . 
 Kizirian is widely known in the state of Rhode Island , where a post office , a plaza , and an elementary school are named in his honor . The Harry Kizirian Post Office became the first United States federal building named after an Armenian American . Inducted in the Rhode Island Hall of Fame in 1978 , Kizirian is regarded as a " national treasure " and has been honored by numerous organizations . 
 = = Life = = 
 Kizirian , a first generation Armenian American , was born in his home on July 13 , 1925 at 134 Chad Brown St. Providence , Rhode Island . He was the only son of Toros and Hripsime Kizirian , who were born in <unk> ( <unk> ) , near Sivas , in the Ottoman Empire . Kizirian 's mother came to the United States in the 1920s after losing her first husband and seven children during the Armenian Genocide . His father was employed by the Rhode Island Tool Company and his mother was a housewife . 
 Kizirian , who was active in sports , was offered a scholarship to LaSalle Academy . He declined the offer so that he could attend the local Mt . Pleasant High School and be closer to his friends . Kizirian became a top athlete in his class ; he played on the football team for three years and became captain in his senior year . 
 When Kizirian was 15 years old , his father died . Harry became responsible for the care of himself and his mother . To take care of the family 's immediate needs , Kizirian worked at a meat packing plant unloading sides of beef from freight cars . He then got a temporary position at the Providence post office for two years while finishing high school . 
 On February 23 , 1944 — the day after his graduation from high school — Kizirian enlisted in the United States Marine Corps . He was sent overseas on October 6 , 1944 and was assigned to the 6th Marine Division 
 After spending seventeen months overseas , Kizirian returned to Providence , where he married Hazel <unk> of Massena , New York . For the first four years after his return , Kizirian underwent treatment for wounds he suffered during battle . In spite of undergoing several major surgeries , Kizirian was left with permanent disabilities . 
 After recovering from a life @-@ threatening illness in which surgeons removed 95 percent of his stomach , Kizirian entered a career in the Postal Service . He first returned to the Providence post office as a substitute clerk . In 1954 , he was appointed foreman , the first of several promotions he received throughout his life . In 1961 , he was made Postmaster of Providence by President John F. Kennedy . Congress unanimously confirmed the appointment . At age 36 , Kizirian was one of the youngest postmasters in the country . During his tenure , Kizirian was instrumental in establishing the first automated post office . The Providence post office would be an exemplary model for post offices around the world . Kizirian later remarked , " There is no nation on this earth that didn 't send representatives to see the new post office . " 
 In 1986 , Kizirian was removed from his position amid opposition from Senators John Chafee and Claiborne Pell . Despite protests from the employees who wore pins that said " We Love Harry " , Kizirian 's position was eliminated and he subsequently retired . 
 <unk> and his wife had five children : Joanne , Thomas , Janice , <unk> , and Richard . 
 Kizirian died on September 13 , 2002 at age 77 . His funeral procession was held at the Saint <unk> Armenian Apostolic Church in Providence and he is buried at the Swan Point Cemetery .

 <unk> joined the Marine Corps on February 23 , 1944 . He was sent overseas after training and assigned to Company E , 2nd Battalion , 22nd Marines , 6th Marine Division on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands . Serving as a fire team leader , he participated in the invasion of Okinawa on April 1 , 1945 , landing with the first assault wave . On May 11 , he charged an enemy machine gun position that had pinned down members of another unit of his platoon and forced the enemy to withdrawal so the other Marine unit could continue its advance on the enemy . Wounded during his attack on the enemy , he and his fire team joined up with the other Marine unit in its advance on the Japanese . Company E moved east the same day toward Shuri Ridge . On May 14 , Company E attacked and seized the Japanese air strip , then stopped for a short rest . Kizirian 's injuries on May 11 included shell fragments in his shoulders and arms . Despite his wounds he continued fighting . He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Combat " V " and the Purple Heart Medal for his actions on May 11 . His Bronze Star citation reads : 
 For heroic achievement in connection with operations against the Japanese enemy on Okinawa Shima , Ryukyu Islands , on May 11 , 1945 . While serving as a fire team leader in a Marine rifle company , Corporal Kizirian , seeing a unit of his advancing platoon pinned down by enemy machine gun fire , courageously charged the enemy emplacement , thus enabling the trapped unit to continue to advance . Although painfully wounded , he fearlessly closed in on the emplacement , firing rapidly into the embrasure and succeeded in driving the enemy from their weapon . Meanwhile , men of the trapped unit continued to move out in the assault , and Corporal Kizirian , still leading his fire team , joined them . By this prompt and heroic action , Corporal Kizirian assisted materially in the continued advance of his platoon . His actions were at all time in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service . 
 After a month to recover from his wounds , Kizirian rejoined his unit , which was assigned to Sugar Loaf Hill . The Marines battled over one ridge after another toward NaHa , the capital city . On three separate occasions Kizirian was tossed in the air by Japanese artillery and mortar fire while he provided covering fire for other members of his unit , who were retreating down a slope . Kizirian 's company moved to a burial ground where Japanese soldiers were hiding in holes dug in the nearby hillsides . During the operation , someone yelled , " Two over your head ! " Kizirian responded by killing both of the enemy combatants with his carbine . Kizirian would later recall , " I must have shot four clips into those guys , I got them before they got me . " Moments later , an enemy rushed towards Kizirian with a sword . Kizirian managed to kill the enemy with a pistol and took the sword . 
 The battalion commander was killed , and soon afterwards , orders arrived to seek and destroy any enemy combatants around NaHa . On June 11 , 1945 , Kizirian was assigned the special task of patrolling to locate elements of an enemy reserve platoon . His unit moved to attack Japanese soldiers entrenched along a ridge line . Through the smoke and dust , he noticed six stretcher bearers and a wounded Marine that were under heavy machine gun fire . Disregarding his own safety , Kizirian placed himself in the line of fire and single @-@ handedly attacked the enemy emplacement . The Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces that confronted Kizirian shot him in the legs and abdomen . Unable to walk , he still managed to make his way forward using his elbows to a position where he was able to shoot and kill all 12 soldiers manning the machine gun . Due to these actions , Kizirian was awarded the Navy Cross , the second highest medal in the United States military . The citation provides details about the event : 
 The Navy Cross is presented to Harry Kizirian , Corporal , U.S. Marine Corps ( Reserve ) , for extraordinary heroism while serving as an Automatic Rifleman of Company E , Second Battalion , Twenty @-@ second Marines , Sixth Marine Division , in action against enemy Japanese forces on Okinawa , Ryukyu Islands , on 11 June 1945 . Returning from an assigned mission of locating elements of a reserve platoon , Private First Class Kizirian observed a stretcher party of Marines pinned down and suffering casualties while attempting to evacuate the wounded of an adjacent unit . Determined to reach a more advantageous position to deliver accurate fire on the enemy , he unhesitatingly moved forward . Immediately exposed to additional hostile fire which wounded him in both legs and abdomen , he continued to drag himself forward by pressure of his elbows , alternately firing and advancing until he had killed all twelve of the Japanese in the emplacement . By his outstanding courage and aggressive fighting spirit , Private First Class Kizirian enabled the stretcher party to advance and evacuate the wounded . His gallant devotion to duty throughout was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service . 
 After making a recovery , Kizirian and the Marine units took the capital city of NaHa and were preparing for another assault . Kizirian 's unit had fought its way to the crest of a hill and dug in . Kizirian was standing watch at the company command post inside an Okinawa burial ground . When replacements joined the company , many Japanese soldiers harassed the lines by infiltrating the positions of the more inexperienced soldiers . Kizirian ordered that flares should be fired at irregular intervals to would illuminate the scene and distract the enemy . The idea proved successful and the newly arrived Marines soon had the situation under control . 
 During a break in fighting at Okinawa , Kizirian was photographed by a member of the press . The picture that later appeared on the cover of the June 24 , 1945 issue of The New York Times Sunday Magazine . The photograph became the face of the battle for thousands of Americans . 
 After serving seventeen months overseas , Kizirian received discharge from the Marine Corps on February 11 , 1946 .

 In 1987 , the Rhode Island Chapter of the American Society for Public Administration ( <unk> ) presented him with its John O. <unk> Distinguished Public Service Award . Upon his retirement , a special stamp cancellation showing the flag @-@ raising on Battle of Iwo Jima was issued in his honor . 
 In October 1994 , Kizirian was honored by his own Atwood @-@ <unk> Detachment of the U.S. Marine Corps League . The tribute was attended by Providence Mayor Vincent Cianci , Senator John Pastore , and Rhode Island governor Bruce Sundlun with letters read from Postmaster General Marvin Runyon . 
 On February 2 , 1996 , President Bill Clinton signed House Resolution 1606 which renamed the post office located at 24 Corliss Street , Providence , Rhode Island , as the Harry Kizirian Post Office Building . It was the first United States federal building named after an Armenian American . The opening ceremony was attended by Mayor Vincent Cianci , House of Representative Jack Reed , Senator John Chafee and Governor of Rhode Island Lincoln Carter Almond . The area outside the post office was named Harry Kizirian Plaza in his honor . Additionally , on May 26 , 2001 , the Providence City Council passed a resolution that renamed Smith Hill 's Camden Avenue School after Kizirian . 
 Kizirian received the Seven Seals Award from the Rhode Island committee of the Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve in recognition of his three @-@ year term as state chairman . Rhode Island College bestowed its alumni service award on him in 1986 , and he received an honorary doctorate in humanities from Roger Williams College in 1983 .

 When asked what went through his mind when he was blown into the air by enemy bombardment , Kizirian responded : 
 I wondered if I was ever going to get down again ... I would have made a poor angel , you know ... angels without wings are as uncommon up there as a Marine without guts down here . 
 His advice to youth was : 
 Let me say this to young people . War is awful . There 's no way to describe it . Nobody wins a war . Don 't let any historian tell you differently . 
 = Snow = 
 Snow is precipitation in the form of flakes of crystalline water ice that falls from clouds . 
 Since snow is composed of small ice particles , it is a granular material . It has an open and therefore soft , white , and fluffy structure , unless subjected to external pressure . Snowflakes come in a variety of sizes and shapes . Types that fall in the form of a ball due to melting and refreezing , rather than a flake , are hail , ice pellets or snow grains . 
 The process of precipitating snow is called snowfall . Snowfall tends to form within regions of upward movement of air around a type of low @-@ pressure system known as an extratropical cyclone . Snow can fall poleward of these systems ' associated warm fronts and within their comma head precipitation patterns ( called such due to the comma @-@ like shape of the cloud and precipitation pattern around the poleward and west sides of extratropical cyclones ) . Where relatively warm water bodies are present , for example because of water evaporation from lakes , lake @-@ effect snowfall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold cyclonic flow around the backside of extratropical cyclones . Lake @-@ effect snowfall can be heavy locally . Thundersnow is possible within a cyclone 's comma head and within lake effect precipitation bands . In mountainous areas , heavy snow is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation , if the atmosphere is cold enough . Snowfall amount and its related liquid equivalent precipitation amount are measured using a variety of different rain gauges . 
 = = Forms = = 
 Once on the ground , snow can be categorized as powdery when light and fluffy , fresh when recent but heavier , granular when it begins the cycle of melting and refreezing , and eventually ice once it comes down , after multiple melting and refreezing cycles , into a dense mass called snow pack . When powdery , snow moves with the wind from the location where it originally landed , forming deposits called snowdrifts that may have a depth of several meters . After attaching itself to hillsides , blown snow can evolve into a snow slab — an avalanche hazard on steep slopes . The existence of a snowpack keeps temperatures lower than they would be otherwise , as the whiteness of the snow reflects most sunlight , and any absorbed heat goes into melting the snow rather than increasing its temperature . The water equivalent of snowfall is measured to monitor how much liquid is available to flood rivers from meltwater that will occur during the following spring . Snow cover can protect crops from extreme cold . If snowfall stays on the ground for a series of years uninterrupted , the snowpack develops into a mass of ice called glacier . Fresh snow absorbs sound , lowering ambient noise over a landscape because the trapped air between snowflakes attenuates vibration . These acoustic qualities quickly minimize and reverse , once a layer of freezing rain falls on top of snow cover . Walking across snowfall produces a squeaking sound at low temperatures . 
 The energy balance of the snowpack itself is dictated by several heat exchange processes . The snowpack absorbs solar shortwave radiation that is partially blocked by cloud cover and reflected by snow surface . A long @-@ wave heat exchange takes place between the snowpack and its surrounding environment that includes overlying air mass , tree cover and clouds . Heat exchange takes place by convection between the snowpack and the overlaying air mass , and it is governed by the temperature gradient and wind speed . Moisture exchange between the snowpack and the overlying air mass is accompanied by latent heat transfer that is influenced by vapor pressure gradient and air wind . Rain on snow can add significant amounts of thermal energy to the snowpack . A generally insignificant heat exchange takes place by conduction between the snowpack and the ground . The small temperature change from before to after a snowfall is a result of the heat transfer between the snowpack and the air . As snow degrades , its surface can develop characteristic ablation textures such as <unk> or <unk> . 
 The term snow storm can describe a heavy snowfall , while a blizzard involves snow and wind , obscuring visibility . Snow shower is a term for an intermittent snowfall , while flurry is used for very light , brief snowfalls . Snow can fall more than a meter at a time during a single storm in flat areas , and meters at a time in rugged terrain , such as mountains . When snow falls in significant quantities , travel by foot , car , airplane and other means becomes severely restricted , but other methods of mobility become possible , such as the use of snowmobiles , snowshoes and skis . When heavy snow occurs early in the fall ( or , on rarer occasions , late in the spring ) , significant damage can occur to trees still in leaf . Areas with significant snow each year can store the winter snow within an ice house , which can be used to cool structures during the following summer . A variation on snow has been observed on Venus , though composed of metallic compounds and occurring at a substantially higher temperature . 
 = = Cause = = 
 Extratropical cyclones can bring cold and dangerous conditions with heavy rain and snow with winds exceeding 119 km / h ( 74 mph ) , ( sometimes referred to as windstorms in Europe ) . The band of precipitation that is associated with their warm front is often extensive , forced by weak upward vertical motion of air over the frontal boundary , which condenses as it cools off and produces precipitation within an elongated band , which is wide and stratiform , meaning falling out of nimbostratus clouds . When moist air tries to dislodge an arctic air mass , overrunning snow can result within the poleward side of the elongated precipitation band . In the Northern Hemisphere , poleward is towards the North Pole , or north . Within the Southern Hemisphere , poleward is towards the South Pole , or south . 
 Within the cold sector , poleward and west of the cyclone center , small scale or mesoscale bands of heavy snow can occur within a cyclone 's comma head pattern . The cyclone 's comma head pattern is a comma @-@ shaped area of clouds and precipitation found around mature extratropical cyclones . These snow bands typically have a width of 20 to 50 miles ( 32 to 80 kilometers ) . These bands in the comma head are associated with areas of frontogenesis , or zones of strengthening temperature contrast . 
 Southwest of extratropical cyclones , curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow lake @-@ effect snow bands . Those bands bring strong localized snowfall , which can be understood as follows : Large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences ( larger than 13 ° C [ 23 ° F ] ) between the water surface and the air above . Because of this temperature difference , warmth and moisture are transported upward , condensing into vertically oriented clouds ( see satellite picture ) that produce snow showers . The temperature decrease with height and cloud depth are directly affected by both the water temperature and the large @-@ scale environment . The stronger the temperature decrease with height , the deeper the clouds get , and the greater the precipitation rate becomes . 
 In mountainous areas , heavy snowfall accumulates when air is forced to ascend the mountains and squeeze out precipitation along their windward slopes , which in cold conditions , falls in the form of snow . Because of the ruggedness of terrain , forecasting the location of heavy snowfall remains a significant challenge . 
 = = Snowflakes = = 
 Snow crystals form when tiny supercooled cloud droplets ( about 10 μm in diameter ) freeze . These droplets are able to remain liquid at temperatures lower than − 18 ° C ( 0 ° F ) , because to freeze , a few molecules in the droplet need to get together by chance to form an arrangement similar to that in an ice lattice . Then the droplet freezes around this " nucleus " . Experiments show that this " homogeneous " nucleation of cloud droplets only occurs at temperatures lower than − 35 ° C ( − 31 ° F ) . In warmer clouds an aerosol particle or " ice nucleus " must be present in ( or in contact with ) the droplet to act as a nucleus . Ice nuclei are very rare compared to that cloud condensation nuclei on which liquid droplets form . Clays , desert dust and biological particles may be effective , although to what extent is unclear . Artificial nuclei include particles of silver iodide and dry ice , and these are used to stimulate precipitation in cloud seeding . 
 Once a droplet has frozen , it grows in the supersaturated environment — one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point . The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air ( vapor ) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected . Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance , the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets by a process known as the Wegner @-@ Bergeron @-@ <unk> process . The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets ' expense . These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation , since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass , and may collide and stick together in clusters , or aggregates . These aggregates are snowflakes , and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground . Guinness World Records list the world 's largest snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh , Montana ; allegedly one measured 38 cm ( 15 in ) wide . Although the ice is clear , scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows / imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles . 
 The shape of the snowflake is determined broadly by the temperature and humidity at which it is formed . The most common snow particles are visibly irregular . Planar crystals ( thin and flat ) grow in air between 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) and − 3 ° C ( 27 ° F ) . Between − 3 ° C ( 27 ° F ) and − 8 ° C ( 18 ° F ) , the crystals will form needles or hollow columns or prisms ( long thin pencil @-@ like shapes ) . From − 8 ° C ( 18 ° F ) to − 22 ° C ( − 8 ° F ) the shape reverts to plate @-@ like , often with branched or dendritic features . At temperatures below − 22 ° C ( − 8 ° F ) , the crystal development becomes column @-@ like , although many more complex growth patterns also form such as side @-@ planes , bullet @-@ rosettes and also planar types depending on the conditions and ice nuclei . If a crystal has started forming in a column growth regime , at around − 5 ° C ( 23 ° F ) , and then falls into the warmer plate @-@ like regime , then plate or dendritic crystals sprout at the end of the column , producing so called " capped columns " . 
 A snowflake consists of roughly 1019 water molecules , which are added to its core at different rates and in different patterns , depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through on its way to the ground . As a result , it is extremely difficult to encounter two identical snowflakes . Initial attempts to find identical snowflakes by photographing thousands their images under a microscope from 1885 onward by Wilson Alwyn Bentley found the wide variety of snowflakes we know about today . It is more likely that two snowflakes could become virtually identical if their environments were similar enough . Matching snow crystals were discovered in Wisconsin in 1988 . The crystals were not flakes in the usual sense but rather hollow hexagonal prisms . 
 = = Types = = 
 Types of snow can be designated by the shape of the flakes , the rate of accumulation , and the way the snow collects on the ground . Types that fall in the form of a ball due to melting and refreezing cycles , rather than a flake , are known as graupel , with ice pellets and snow pellets as types of graupel associated with wintry precipitation . Once on the ground , snow can be categorized as powdery when fluffy , granular when it begins the cycle of melting and refreezing , and eventually ice once it packs down into a dense drift after multiple melting and refreezing cycles . When powdery , snow drifts with the wind from the location where it originally fell , forming deposits with a depth of several meters in isolated locations . Snow fences are constructed in order to help control snow drifting in the vicinity of roads , to improve highway safety . After attaching to hillsides , blown snow can evolve into a snow slab , which is an avalanche hazard on steep slopes . A frozen equivalent of dew known as hoar frost forms on a snow pack when winds are light and there is ample low @-@ level moisture over the snow pack . 
 Snowfall 's intensity is determined by visibility . When the visibility is over 1 kilometer ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) , snow is considered light . Moderate snow describes snowfall with visibility restrictions between 0 @.@ 5 and 1 km . Heavy snowfall describes conditions when visibility is less than 0 @.@ 5 km . Steady snows of significant intensity are often referred to as " snowstorms " . When snow is of variable intensity and short duration , it is described as a " snow shower " . The term snow flurry is used to describe the lightest form of a snow shower . 
 A blizzard is a weather condition involving snow and has varying definitions in different parts of the world . In the United States , a blizzard occurs when two conditions are met for a period of three hours or more : A sustained wind or frequent gusts to 35 miles per hour ( 56 km / h ) , and sufficient snow in the air to reduce visibility to less than 0 @.@ 4 kilometers ( 0 @.@ 25 mi ) . In Canada and the United Kingdom , the criteria are similar . While heavy snowfall often occurs during blizzard conditions , falling snow is not a requirement , as blowing snow can create a ground blizzard . 
 = = Colours = = 
 While snow in its pure form is white in colour , different colours can be caused by several factors including algae and air pollution . In numerous cases , yellow , black , red ( or pink ) , blue , brown and orange snow has been reported . 
 = = = Yellow = = = 
 Yellow snow is commonly known as , and indeed often the result of , animal urine marks . 
 However , it can also occur as a result of pollen or pine in the snow , certain air pollutants or sunlight hitting the snow . It may already be yellow as it falls from the sky when sand particles , other cloud seeds or industrial waste is present in the air . 
 In some of these cases , yellow snow may cause health hazards . 
 = = Density = = 
 Snow remains on the ground until it melts or sublimates . <unk> of snow directly into water vapor is most likely to occur on a dry and windy day such as when a strong downslope wind , such as a Chinook wind , exists . 
 Once the snow is on the ground , it will settle under its own weight ( largely due to differential evaporation ) until its density is approximately 30 % of water . Increases in density above this initial compression occur primarily by melting and refreezing , caused by temperatures above freezing or by direct solar radiation . In colder climates , snow lies on the ground all winter . By late spring , snow densities typically reach a maximum of 50 % of water . When the snow does not all melt in the summer it evolves into <unk> , where individual granules become more spherical in nature , evolving into a glacier as the ice flows downhill . 
 = = = Snow water equivalent = = = 
 The snow water equivalent is the product of snow depth and the snow bulk density . It is a quantity of type columnar mass density , having units of area density ( kg / m2 ) , though it is usually reported normalized by the volumetric density of liquid water ( units kg / m3 ) , thus being expressed in units of length ( e.g. , millimeter or inches ) . It corresponds to the depth of a layer of water that would accumulate in an area , if all the snow and ice were melted in that given area . For example , if the snow covering a given area has a water equivalent of 50 centimeters ( 20 in ) , then it will melt into a pool of water 50 centimeters ( 20 in ) deep covering the same area . This is a much more useful measurement to hydrologists than snow depth , as the density of cool freshly fallen snow widely varies . New snow commonly has a density of around 8 % of water . This means that 33 centimeters ( 13 in ) of snow melts down to 2 @.@ 5 centimeters ( 1 in ) of water . Cloud temperatures and physical processes in the cloud affect the shape of individual snow crystals . Highly branched or dendritic crystals tend to have more space between the arms of ice that form the snowflake and this snow will therefore have a lower density , often referred to as " dry " snow . Conditions that create columnar or plate @-@ like crystals will have much less air space within the crystal and will therefore be denser and feel " wetter " . 
 = = Acoustic properties = = 
 Newly fallen snow acts as a sound @-@ absorbing material , which minimizes sound over its surface . This is due to the trapped air between the individual crystalline flakes , trapping sound waves and dampening vibrations . Once it is blown around by the wind and exposed to sunshine , snow hardens and its sound @-@ softening quality diminishes . Snow cover as thin as 2 centimeters ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick changes the acoustic properties of a landscape . Studies concerning the acoustic properties of snow have revealed that loud sounds , such as from a pistol , can be used to measure snow cover permeability and depth . Within motion pictures , the sound of walking through snow is simulated using cornstarch , salt , or cat litter . When the temperature falls below − 10 ° C ( 14 ° F ) , snow will squeak when walked upon due to the crushing of the ice crystals within the snow . If covered by a layer of freezing rain , the hardened frozen surface acts to echo sounds , similar to concrete . 
 From under water , snowfall has a unique sound when compared to other forms of precipitation , and the sound varies little with differences in the snowflakes ' size and shape .

 Snowfall is defined by the U.S. National Weather Service as a being the maximum depth of snow on a snowboard ( typically a piece of plywood painted white ) observed during a six @-@ hour period . At the end of the six @-@ hour period , all snow is cleared from the measuring surface . For a daily total snowfall , four six @-@ hour snowfall measurements are summed . Snowfall can be very difficult to measure due to melting , compacting , blowing and drifting . 
 The liquid equivalent of snowfall may be evaluated using a snow gauge or with a standard rain gauge having a diameter of 100 mm ( 4 in ; plastic ) or 200 mm ( 8 in ; metal ) . Rain gauges are adjusted to winter by removing the funnel and inner cylinder and allowing the snow / freezing rain to collect inside the outer cylinder . Antifreeze liquid may be added to melt the snow or ice that falls into the gauge . In both types of gauges once the snowfall / ice is finished accumulating , or as its height in the gauge approaches 300 mm ( 12 in ) , the snow is melted and the water amount recorded . 
 Another type of gauge used to measure the liquid equivalent of snowfall is the weighing precipitation gauge . The wedge and tipping bucket gauges will have problems with snow measurement . Attempts to compensate for snow / ice by warming the tipping bucket meet with limited success , since snow may sublimate if the gauge is kept much above the freezing temperature . Weighing gauges with antifreeze should do fine with snow , but again , the funnel needs to be removed before the event begins . At some automatic weather stations an ultrasonic snow depth sensor may be used to augment the precipitation gauge . 
 Spring snow melt is a major source of water supply to areas in temperate zones near mountains that catch and hold winter snow , especially those with a prolonged dry summer . In such places , water equivalent is of great interest to water managers wishing to predict spring runoff and the water supply of cities downstream . Measurements are made manually at marked locations known as snow courses , and remotely using special scales called snow pillows . 
 When a snow measurement is made , various networks exist across the United States and elsewhere where rainfall measurements can be submitted through the Internet , such as <unk> or GLOBE . If a network is not available in the area where one lives , the nearest local weather office will likely be interested in the measurement . 
 = = Records = = 
 The world record for the highest seasonal total snowfall was measured in the United States at Mount Baker Ski Area , outside of the town Bellingham , Washington during the 1998 – 1999 season . Mount Baker received 2 @,@ 896 cm ( 95 @.@ 01 ft ) of snow , thus surpassing the previous record holder , Mount Rainier , Washington , which during the 1971 – 1972 season received 2 @,@ 850 cm ( 93 @.@ 5 ft ) of snow . 
 The world record for the highest average yearly snowfall is 1 @,@ 764 cm ( 57 @.@ 87 ft ) , measured in <unk> Onsen , Japan for the period of 1981 – 2010 . 
 The North American record for the highest average yearly snowfall is 1 @,@ 630 cm ( 53 @.@ 5 ft ) , measured on Mount Rainier , Washington . 
 The world record for snow depth is 1 @,@ 182 cm ( 38 @.@ 78 ft ) . It was measured on the slope of Mt . Ibuki in Shiga Prefecture , Japan at altitude of 1 @,@ 200 m ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) on February 14 , 1927 . 
 The North American record for snow depth is 1 @,@ 150 cm ( 37 @.@ 7 ft ) . It was measured at Tamarack , California at altitude of 2 @,@ 100 m ( 7 @,@ 000 ft ) in March 1911 . 
 The world 's snowiest city with a population over one million is Sapporo , Japan , with an average yearly snowfall of 595 cm ( 19 @.@ 52 ft ) . 
 = = Snow blindness = = 
 Fresh snow reflects 90 % or more of ultraviolet radiation , which causes snow blindness , also reducing absorption of sunlight by the ground . Snow blindness ( also known as ultraviolet keratitis , <unk> or <unk> ) is a painful eye condition , caused by exposure of unprotected eyes to the ultraviolet ( UV ) rays in bright sunlight reflected from snow or ice . This condition is a problem in polar regions and at high altitudes , as with every 300 meters ( 980 ft ) of elevation ( above sea level ) , the intensity of UV rays increases by 4 % . Snow 's large reflection of light makes night skies much brighter , since reflected light is directed back up into the sky . However , when there is also cloud cover , light is then reflected back to the ground . This greatly amplifies light emitted from city lights , causing the ' bright night ' effect . A similar brightening effect occurs when no snow is falling and there is a full moon and a large amount of snow . 
 = = Relation to river flow = = 
 Many rivers originating in mountainous or high @-@ latitude regions receive a significant portion of their flow from snowmelt . This often makes the river 's flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic flooding during the spring months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain West of the US or most of Iran and Afghanistan , very low flow for the rest of the year . In contrast , if much of the melt is from glaciated or nearly glaciated areas , the melt continues through the warm season , with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer . 
 = = Effects on human society = = 
 Substantial snowfall can disrupt public infrastructure and services , slowing human activity even in regions that are accustomed to such weather . Air and ground transport may be greatly inhibited or shut down entirely . Populations living in snow @-@ prone areas have developed various ways to travel across the snow , such as skis , snowshoes , and sleds pulled by horses , dogs , or other animals and later , snowmobiles . Basic utilities such as electricity , telephone lines , and gas supply can also fail . In addition , snow can make roads much harder to travel and vehicles attempting to use them can easily become stuck . Snowfall can have a small negative effect on yearly yield from solar photovoltaic systems . 
 The combined effects can lead to a " snow day " on which gatherings such as school or work are officially canceled . In areas that normally have very little or no snow , a snow day may occur when there is only light accumulation or even the threat of snowfall , since those areas are unprepared to handle any amount of snow . In some areas , such as some states in the United States , schools are given a yearly quota of snow days ( or " calamity days " ) . Once the quota is exceeded , the snow days must be made up . In other states , all snow days must be made up . For example , schools may extend the remaining school days later into the afternoon , shorten spring break , or delay the start of summer vacation . 
 Accumulated snow is removed to make travel easier and safer , and to decrease the long @-@ term impact of a heavy snowfall . This process utilizes shovels , snowplows and snow blowers and is often assisted by sprinkling salt or other chloride @-@ based chemicals , which reduce the melting temperature of snow . In some areas with abundant snowfall , such as Yamagata Prefecture , Japan , people harvest snow and store it surrounded by insulation in ice houses . This allows the snow to be used through the summer for refrigeration and air conditioning , which requires far less electricity than traditional cooling methods . 
 = = = Agriculture = = = 
 Snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator , conserving the heat of the Earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather . Some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring , providing water for crop growth . If it melts into water and <unk> upon sensitive crops , such as oranges , the resulting ice will protect the fruit from exposure to lower temperatures . 
 = = = Recreation = = = 
 Many winter sports , such as skiing , snowboarding , snowmobiling , and snowshoeing depend upon snow . Where snow is scarce but the temperature is low enough , snow cannons may be used to produce an adequate amount for such sports . Children and adults can play on a sled or ride in a sleigh . Although a person 's footsteps remain a visible lifeline within a snow @-@ covered landscape , snow cover is considered a general danger to hiking since the snow obscures landmarks and makes the landscape itself appear uniform . 
 One of the recognizable recreational uses of snow is in building snowmen . A snowman is created by making a man shaped figure out of snow – often using a large , shaped snowball for the body and a smaller snowball for the head which is often decorated with simple household items – traditionally including a carrot for a nose , and coal for eyes , nose and mouth ; occasionally including old clothes such as a top hat or scarf . 
 Snow can be used to make snow cones , also known as snowballs , which are usually eaten in the summer months . Flat areas of snow can be used to make snow angels , a popular pastime for children . 
 Snow can be used to alter the format of outdoor games such as Capture the flag , or for snowball fights . The world 's biggest <unk> , the <unk> of Kemi , is built in Kemi , Finland every winter . Since 1928 Michigan Technological University in Houghton , Michigan has held an annual Winter Carnival in mid @-@ February , during which a large Snow Sculpture Contest takes place between various clubs , fraternities , and organizations in the community and the university . Each year there is a central theme , and prizes are awarded based on creativity . Snowball softball tournaments are held in snowy areas , usually using a bright orange softball for visibility , and burlap sacks filled with snow for the bases . 
 = = Damage = = 
 When heavy , wet snow with a snow @-@ water equivalent ( SWE ) ratio of between 6 : 1 and 12 : 1 ( in extreme cases , as heavy as 4 : 1 ) and a weight in excess of 10 pounds per square foot ( ~ 40 kg / m2 ) piles onto trees or electricity lines – particularly if the trees have full leaves or are not adapted to snow – significant damage may occur on a scale usually associated with hurricanes . An avalanche can occur upon a sudden thermal or mechanical impact upon snow that has accumulated on a mountain , which causes the snow to rush downhill en masse . Preceding an avalanche is a phenomenon known as an avalanche wind caused by the approaching avalanche itself , which adds to its destructive potential . Large amounts of snow which accumulate on top of man @-@ made structures can lead to structural failure . During snowmelt , acidic precipitation which previously fell into the snow pack is released , which harms marine life . 
 There is a popular misconception that snow becomes heavier when it starts to melt , so many people take risks by climbing on roofs to remove snow when the weather starts to get warmer , for fear that the roofs will collapse . In fact , when snow starts to melt , its volume decreases as the ice crystals and meltwater move into the spaces between the crystals , which makes the density of wet , melting snow greater than that of freshly @-@ fallen snow . This makes it feel heavier to shovel , but its mass does not increase . In fact , it decreases when meltwater runs off the roof , so the weight of snow on a roof actually decreases when it starts to melt . 
 = = Design of structures considering snow load = = 
 The designs of all structures and buildings use the ground snow load determined by professional engineers and designers . Data on ground snow in the U.S.A. are provided by the American Society of Civil Engineers ( <unk> @-@ latest edition ) for most jurisdictions . This load is typically the governing design factor on roofs and structural elements exposed to the effects of snow in the northern United States . Closer to the Equator , the snow load becomes less important and may or may not be the governing factor . 
 = = Extraterrestrial snow = = 
 Very light snow is known to occur at high latitudes on Mars . A " snow " of hydrocarbons is also theorized to occur on Saturn 's moon Titan . 
 While there is little or no water on Venus , there is a phenomenon which is quite similar to snow . The Magellan probe imaged a highly reflective substance at the tops of Venus 's highest mountain peaks which bore a strong resemblance to terrestrial snow . This substance arguably formed from a similar process to snow , albeit at a far higher temperature . Too volatile to condense on the surface , it rose in gas form to cooler higher elevations , where it then fell as precipitation . The identity of this substance is not known with certainty , but speculation has ranged from elemental tellurium to lead sulfide ( galena ) .

On the October 22 episode of Impact ! , The Beautiful People began appearing in backstage segments they dubbed as their reality show " The <unk> Girls " , an allusion to the 2004 teen comedy Mean Girls . 
 In the pilot episode , The Beautiful People attacked Taylor Wilde and Sarita , and engaged in a food fight , with The Beautiful People coming out on top . In the sequel , which aired on the November 5 episode of Impact ! , the Beautiful People attacked ODB , setting up a six @-@ Knockout tag team match at Turning Point , for both the Knockouts Championship and the Knockouts Tag Team Championship . At the pay @-@ per @-@ view , the Beautiful People were unsuccessful , as ODB pinned Rayne to win the match for the reigning champions . Around this time , the Beautiful People began using a weapon dubbed Lacey 's Ugly Stick , a pink baton . 
 Angelina Love returned to the company on the January 14 , 2010 episode of Impact ! , but instead of re @-@ joining The Beautiful People , she attacked them . Several weeks later on March 8 , Rayne and Velvet Sky defeated the teams of Love and Tara , and Sarita and Taylor Wilde in a three @-@ way match to win the vacant Knockouts Tag Team Championship . Under the Freebird Rule , all three members of The Beautiful People were considered champions , and any combination of two members were permitted to defend the title . At Lockdown in April , Rayne and Sky partnered against Tara and Angelina Love in a tag team cage match , during which Rayne pinned Tara to win Love 's Knockouts Championship . With the win , she became the first person to hold both the Knockout Championship and the Knockouts Tag Team <unk> simultaneously . The following month at Sacrifice , Rayne defeated Tara in a Title vs. Career match , causing Tara to retire from TNA and ending the storyline rivalry between Tara and The Beautiful People . At Slammiversary VIII Rayne retained her title against Roxxi in another Title vs. Career match .

 On July 11 at the Victory Road pay @-@ per @-@ view , Rayne lost the Knockouts Championship to Angelina Love in another Title vs. Career match by disqualification due to outside interference from a person incognito in a motorcycle helmet . Prior to the match , it was announced that the title would change hands by disqualification , if either Velvet Sky or Lacey Von Erich interfered in the match . However , the title was returned to Rayne on the July 22 episode of Impact ! , when it was declared that there was no proof that the person who had interfered in the match was either Sky or Von Erich , making Rayne a two @-@ time Knockouts Champion . 
 After weeks of arguing amongst each other over Rayne 's attitude , the Beautiful People agreed to a truce on the July 29 episode of Impact ! . However , on the following episode of Impact ! , Rayne and the mystery woman inadvertently cost Sky and Von Erich the Knockouts Tag Team Championship in a match against Hamada and Taylor Wilde , when their interference backfired . The following week , Rayne lost the Knockouts Championship to Angelina Love , after a distraction caused by Velvet Sky attacking the mystery woman . Rayne received her rematch for the title on the following week 's episode of Impact ! , but was again defeated by Love , after an interference from Velvet Sky . After the match Rayne and the mystery woman beat down Love and Sky . Rayne 's mysterious ally was finally unmasked and revealed as Tara on the September 2 episode of Impact ! , when the two of them defeated the Beautiful People in a tag team match . At the No Surrender pay @-@ per @-@ view , Rayne was defeated by Velvet Sky in a singles match . On the September 16 episode of Impact ! , Rayne and Tara turned on Lacey Von Erich , after she and Rayne failed to regain the Knockouts Tag Team Championship from Hamada and Taylor Wilde . Von Erich was then saved by Love and Sky , who took her back into the Beautiful People . On the September 30 episode of Impact ! , Rayne signed a waiver to allow Tara to return to the ring , after losing a Title vs. Career match , which was supposed to end her TNA career . 
 Rayne attempted to regain the Knockout Championship in a four corners match with Love , Sky and Tara on October 10 at the Bound for Glory pay @-@ per @-@ view , but was unsuccessful , when Tara pinned Sky to win the title . After the match , the outraged Rayne went after special guest referee Mickie James , but ended up being laid out by her . On the October 14 episode of Impact ! , Tara laid down for Rayne and let her pin her to win the championship back , making her a three @-@ time Knockout Champion . On the December 16 episode of Impact ! , Rayne and Tara defeated Mickie James and Miss Tessmacher to advance to the finals of a tournament for the vacated Knockouts Tag Team Championship . The following week , they were defeated in the finals by the team of Angelina Love and Winter . 
 In 2011 , Rayne would start a rivalry with Mickie James over the Knockouts Championship , and would successfully defend the title against her at Genesis , and at Against All Odds in a Last Knockout Standing match , both times after interference from Tara . Afterwards , Rayne , claiming to now be done with James , announced the beginning of an open challenge series intended to find her new opponents , and , as part of it , successfully defended the Knockout Championship against former Knockouts ODB , Roxxi and Alissa Flash . However , during the <unk> , Tara began claiming that Rayne had gone too far in her brutality towards James , but was forced to follow her orders due to being under exclusive contract with Rayne and not with TNA . After Rayne lost her title to James at Lockdown , ending her reign at 188 days , James agreed to give her a rematch for it on the condition that if she is unable to regain the title , Tara would be released from her contract with Rayne . On May 15 at Sacrifice , Tara turned on Rayne during her match with James , costing her the Knockout Championship and guaranteeing herself a release from her contract with Rayne . Rayne attacked Tara on the June 9 episode of Impact Wrestling , costing her and Mickie James their tag team match against Angelina Love and Winter . The two faced each other in a singles match on the July 14 episode of Impact Wrestling , where Tara was victorious after distracting Rayne with her pet tarantula Poison . Rayne returned on the September 29 episode of Impact Wrestling , defeating Tara to earn a shot at the Knockouts Championship at Bound for Glory .

 " Finale " is the last episode of the American comedy television series The Office . It serves as the 24th and 25th episodes of the ninth season , and the 200th and 201st episodes of the series overall . The episode was written by series developer and executive producer Greg Daniels and directed by Ken Kwapis , who directed the series ' pilot episode . It originally aired on NBC on May 16 , 2013 , preceded by an hour @-@ long series retrospective . 
 The series — presented as if it were a real documentary — depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania , branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In the episode , which takes place almost a year after the previous episode " A.A.R.M. " , present and past employees of Dunder Mifflin gather for the wedding of Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) and Angela Martin ( Angela Kinsey ) . In addition , Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) and Jim finally decide to pursue Jim 's dream of working in sports marketing . Finally , everyone comes together for a final round of interviews and goodbyes . 
 The initial idea for the finale , involving the Q & A , was thought of by Daniels during production of the third season . The episode features the return of many recurring characters , as well as Carell , whose return was kept secret for many months . Many members of the show 's crew — such as episode writer Daniels — made cameos in the episode as various background characters . Jennie Tan , the founder of the largest Office fansite OfficeTally appears in the episode as a fictional version of herself asking the members of the office questions . 
 The episode was viewed by an estimated 5 @.@ 69 million viewers and received 3 @.@ 0 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 , making it the highest @-@ rated episode of the series since the eighth season entry , " Pool Party " .

 = = Plot = = 
 One year since the documentary has aired , the crew has returned to gain more footage for the DVD bonus features . Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) and Angela Martin ( Angela Kinsey ) are about to get married . Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) , after being humiliated with his talent show audition tape going viral on the internet , has found a job at his alma mater Cornell University in the Admissions Office . Darryl Philbin ( Craig Robinson ) has helped expand Athlead , now named Athleap , opening a branch in Austin , Texas . Stanley Hudson ( Leslie David Baker ) is enjoying retirement in Florida and Phyllis Vance ( Phyllis Smith ) tries to get Stanley 's replacement Malcolm ( Malcolm Barrett ) fat on chocolates to make him look like Stanley . After being fired by Dwight , Kevin Malone ( Brian Baumgartner ) bought a bar and Toby Flenderson ( Paul Lieberstein ) started a career as an author in New York . Nellie Bertram ( Catherine Tate ) has moved to Poland . Creed Bratton ( Creed Bratton ) had faked his death but was then revealed to be a wanted fugitive , so Dwight replaced him with former employee Devon White ( Devon Abner ) . Oscar Martinez ( Oscar Nunez ) is preparing to run for a State Senate seat and is now Phillip 's godfather . Andy , Darryl , Stanley , Toby , and Nellie return to Scranton for the wedding as well as a panel for the documentary . 
 Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) has been appointed best man at the wedding and proceeds to plan a series of " good surprises " ( " <unk> <unk> " ) for Dwight during his bachelor party , which consists of most of the current and former male employees . At the bachelor party , the group has Dwight fire a bazooka and receive a lap dance from Elizabeth the Stripper ( Jackie Debatin ) , though Dwight thinks she is their waitress and remains oblivious . At the bachelorette party , with the current and former female employees plus Angela 's sister Rachael ( Rachael Harris ) , the group is shocked to see that the stripper hired for entertainment is Meredith Palmer 's ( Kate Flannery ) son Jake ( Spencer Daniels ) . Angela is then kidnapped by Dwight 's cousin Mose ( Michael Schur ) . After hearing about Angela 's kidnapping , Dwight and the male employees visit the bar that Kevin owns , where Dwight , at Jim 's insistence to bury the hatchet , is forced to apologize to Kevin and confirm that his firing was based on his job performance , which cheers him up . The two decide to make amends . Mose then leads Dwight and Jim out to his car where Angela is stuck in the trunk and finally let out . 
 The following day , a panel is held for the office so that audience members can ask them questions . Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace ( Andy Buckley ) openly states his distaste for the documentary . Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) is pressed with questions about why she did not allow Jim to follow his dream after he has paid her so many romantic gestures . Jim attempts repeatedly to disperse the resulting tension . Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) finally meets her birth parents ( Ed Begley , Jr. and Joan Cusack ) who had put her up for adoption . 
 At the wedding , Kelly Kapoor ( Mindy Kaling ) arrives with her husband Ravi ( Sendhil Ramamurthy ) , where Ryan Howard ( B. J. Novak ) surprises them with a baby , his son Drake , that he had with a former girlfriend who then abandoned them both . Jim tells Dwight that under Schrute tradition , he is not allowed to be best man as he is younger than him . Jim surprises him with the arrival of Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) . The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight 's new best man . At the reception , Michael shows Pam pictures of his kids with Holly Flax , and Pam notes that he is paying for two phones just to hold all the pictures . Ryan deliberately gives Drake an allergic reaction so that Ravi , a pediatrician , can attend and Ryan can steal Kelly away . Kevin tells Ravi that Ryan wanted him to keep Drake so that Ryan can have Kelly and the two can start a new life together . Ravi then gives Kevin the baby to give to Child Services before leaving , but Nellie , who has still been wanting a child , takes Drake instead . 
 When Jim and Pam briefly return home , Jim is surprised to find Carol Stills ( Nancy Carell ) showing their house to another couple . Pam comes clean and admits she has been showing the house for two months . She wants to repay Jim for all his romantic gestures and says she wants him to go to Athleap in Austin , at which point the couple seeing the house make an offer . Jim and Pam go to an after party at the warehouse where they inform an elated Darryl of their plans , with Jim being able to rejoin the company with no change . Pam unveils a new painted mural featuring the history of their branch . A final picture is taken with the employees and the camera crew before the employees go back up to the office for a final toast . Jim and Pam tell Dwight they are quitting , but Dwight fires them instead so he can give them hefty severance packages , as a last gesture of friendship . The employees are surprised to find Creed , who has been living in Ryan 's old closet since faking his death , in the office . Creed sings a song on the guitar for the office before being arrested . The employees give one last round of interviews before leaving , with Pam taking her watercolor of the office building that Michael bought from her in the third season episode " Business School " .

 " Finale " was written by series developer and showrunner Greg Daniels , making it his second writing credit for the year , after the season debut " New Guys " , and his 12th writing credit overall . The episode was directed by Ken Kwapis . Kwapis had originally directed the series ' pilot episode . Daniels joked that Kwapis was " the country vet who birthed this puppy " and had come " back to put it down " . His last directorial credit for the series , prior to " Finale " , however , was the fifth season episode " Company Picnic " . The initial idea for the finale was thought of by Daniels during production of the third season , described as " a reunion show " , in the fashion of the post @-@ competition cast rehashes familiar from reality shows like Survivor " . Daniels , at one point , approached Jeff Probst , the host of Survivor , to appear in the finale as a moderator for the fictional reunion , although he declined . The initial table read for the episode took place on March 4 , 2013 . Filming commenced on March 6 . According to Jenna Fischer , the episode took nine days to film , with the cast devoting 12 hours a day to the episode . The finale was described as " ambitious " , featuring multiple location shoots , including one in an AT & T Office Building , which stood in for the Scranton Cultural Center . Filming for the episode and series as a whole came to an end on March 16 , 2013 . Wilson later tweeted a picture of the empty set after all filming had been finished . 
 Originally , the episode was supposed to be the 23rd and 24th episodes of the season , which would have meant that the series aired exactly 200 episodes . However , the series ' penultimate episode was elongated into 2 separate episodes , resulting in " Finale " being the 24th and 25th episodes of the season . This meant that the last part of " Finale " is the series ' 201st episode . Once filming finished Daniels , in an interview with TVLine , expressed his hope to expand the episode , stating , " I was very excited with the footage we got ... It 's very big . I ’ m going to beg NBC to super @-@ size it or extend it . " Daniels later commented that when the editors cut together the first act , it was 23 minutes long ; this is much longer than a normal first act for an hour long episode of television . In response , OfficeTally — the largest fan site for the series — started an online petition to supersize the finale , similar to the petition to expand the second season finale , " Casino Night " . By May 2 , the petition had received over 20 @,@ 000 signatures . On May 7 , it was announced that NBC had extended the episode by 15 minutes , meaning that the episode would air in a 75 @-@ minute time slot . The episode is approximately 52 minutes in length .

 The series finale guest stars Rachael Barrett , Dakota Johnson , Joan Cusack , Ed Begley , Jr . , and Malcolm Barrett . The episode features the return of several of the series ' actors and actresses , including former series writers and stars B. J. Novak and Mindy Kaling , as well as Andy Buckley , Robert R. Shafer , Michael Schur , and Matt L. Jones . Other minor recurring characters also make appearances , such as Nancy Carell as Carol Stills ( who played the recurring role as Michael 's real @-@ estate agent and short @-@ time girlfriend ) , Sendhil Ramamurthy as Ravi ( who first appeared in the eight season episode " Angry Andy " ) , Eric Wareheim as Gabor ( who first appeared in the earlier ninth season episode " Junior Salesman " ) , James Urbaniak as Rolf ( who first appeared in the fifth season episode " Company Picnic " ) , Jackie Debatin as Elizabeth ( who first appeared in the third season episode " Ben Franklin " ) , Devon Abner as Devon ( who was a former Dunder Mifflin employee fired in second season episode " Halloween " ) , and Spencer Daniels as Jake Palmer ( who first played Meredith 's son in the second season episode " Take Your Daughter to Work Day " ) . The episode also features Bill Hader and Seth Meyers playing themselves . 
 Many members of the show 's crew made cameos in the episode . Documentary crewman 's voice that speaks to Dwight was played by camera operator Matt Sohn . The " frat boy " who mocks Andy at the restaurant was Greg Daniels ' former assistant , Jonah Platt . Jay Falk , a script editor for the series , and his wife stood in for the couple buying Jim and Pam 's house . Jennifer Celotta , a series writer and director , makes an appearance at Dwight 's wedding . The episode 's call sheet listed her character as " Jen Celotta Schrute " . Producer and writer Graham Wagner also makes a cameo in both Mose 's group , as well as at the wedding . Many of the individuals who asked questions were writers on the show : Brent Forrester asked about seeing their lives on TV , Amelie Gillette asked the question regarding Jim giving up Athlead , Steve Burgess asked if the camera changed the characters ' behavior , Steve Hely asked if life has no meaning , Allison Silverman made the statement that Jim is attractive , and Dan Sterling asked what was in the teapot . Daniels ' wife , Susanne Daniels , was the Q & A moderator . Daniels himself appeared during the documentary after @-@ party along with executive producer Howard Klein , editors David Rogers and Claire Scanlon , script supervisor Veda Semarne , first assistant director Rusty Mahmood , prop master Phil Shea , and casting director Allison Jones . The remaining extras in the scene were members of the crew of The Office . 
 Jennie Tan , the founder of the largest The Office fansite OfficeTally appears in the episode as a fictional version of herself asking the members of the office questions . She initially emailed Daniels , asking if she could appear in the background in one of the scenes . He , however , hired her as a day actor and wrote her seven lines . During the filming , Daniels re @-@ wrote part of Tan 's line to make it more " pointed " . Tan called the experience " surreal " , because she was " playing [ herself ] but talking to Jim and Pam " , rather than Krasinski and Fischer . 
 Early during production for the season , Kinsey and Wilson also noted that the cast and crew were hoping for a return of former lead actor Carell . In mid @-@ December , Krasinski later revealed that he was optimistic about a return ; in an interview with E ! Online Krasinski said that the producers were supposedly " still trying to figure out [ Carell 's ] schedule " and that the finale " just wouldn 't be the same without him " . However , NBC chairman Robert Greenblatt later admitted during an interview that while he was " hopeful " , he did not think Carell would return ; he noted that Carell was satisfied with his character 's exit and did not want to tarnish it . On January 16 , Daniels revealed that Carell would not appear in the finale in any capacity , a decision that Carell later reiterated . Several months later , however , the producers for The Office mounted " an 11th hour effort " to get Carell to make a cameo in the show 's final episode , according to TVLine . According to the article , " while no one is confirming that the final diplomatic push proved successful , no one is denying it either . " Carell 's personal representative confirmed that Carell was on the set for the final episode , but that he did not film any scenes . However , an anonymous source close to the show cryptically said " don 't rule anything out " . TVLine later reported on May 6 , that Carell would appear in a cameo , although NBC declined to comment and Carell 's representatives continued to deny the reports . A month after the episode aired , Carell explained in an interview with TVLine that he " lied for months to the press , to almost everyone , really " . He noted that he " felt terribly for the cast and for [ executive producer ] Greg Daniels , because they all lied , too . " Krasinski , on the other hand , explained that " It was so thrilling . We all just flat @-@ out lied ... It was just one of those things that we all vowed and had to protect " . Even at the initial table read for the script , Carell 's appearance was not revealed . In fact , his first line was not included in the read at all , and his second was scripted to be delivered by Creed Bratton .

 The Season Nine DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include : more scenes from the Q & A panel ; Pete discussing what he learned working at Dunder Mifflin ; Angela 's sister , Phyllis , and Andy giving toasts at the wedding ; more scenes with Erin and her biological parents in which they reconnect ; further shots of the office members reminiscing about shared memories ; and the office taking one of the potted plants outside and planting it in actual soil . The episode originally was scripted to begin with a different cold open ; it would have entailed a prank on Dwight by Jim , in which Dwight is led to believe that he is actually living in the Matrix , a computer @-@ simulation from the eponymous 1999 film of the same name . The scene was either not filmed , or cut from the episode and not included with the other deleted scenes . A table read of it — along with the rest of the episode — was included as a bonus feature on the ninth season DVD .

 The episode makes a reference to Creed being a member of the rock band The Grass Roots . In fact , Creed Bratton , who portrays a fictionalized version of himself on the show , actually did play with the band from 1967 to 1969 . The song he performs near the end is titled " All the Faces " , which he wrote himself . Andy mentions that both the " Double Rainbow Guy " and the " Star Wars Kid " reached out to help him after his viral video mishap . Both Hader and Meyers appear in a fictional Saturday Night Live Weekend Update sketch involving Andy 's viral fame . After Pam compares her and Jim 's relationship to a great book that never ends , Tan 's character asks if it is comparable to the Harry Potter series . Dwight claims that Google Inc. is actually a front for either the United States government or " the government of other countries " . 
 The episode also features several callback references to previous episodes . Oscar saying " <unk> ! " serves as a reference to a scene from " Pilot " between Michael , Dwight , and Jim . Jim 's description in his final talking head of his job is a direct quote from his first talking head in " Pilot " . Dwight hires Devon back after Creed quits , a reference to " Halloween " , when Creed convinced Michael to fire Devon . Pam sits at reception one final time and answers the phone , saying " Dunder Mifflin , this is Pam . " This is a reference to Pam 's former role as office receptionist and a common phrase that she said during the early seasons . Pam 's painting of the office building , introduced in " Business School " , plays a prominent role in the final scene .

" Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly praised the entry , writing that " for anyone who ’ s stuck with The Office through thick and thin ... last night 's 75 @-@ minute @-@ long finale was pretty much perfect . " She wrote that " the finale had no shortage of sob @-@ inducing moments " , and positively applauded all of the characters ' various happy endings . 
 Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that the episode was " just right " for the series , and that it highlighted the fact that " the ending was more about the fact that you took a journey with these characters . " He wrote that all of the character 's subplots had emotion , even if they appeared slightly contrived . Ultimately he concluded that " it felt okay to say goodbye because it was the right atmosphere . " James Poniewozik of Time wrote that the finale was " touching , sweet , funny , messy , a little manipulative . And in the end , it worked . " He found that " The stuff that was like latter @-@ seasons Office " , such as Andy and Dwight 's antics , were " all right " but that " the stuff that recalled the sweep of the whole series was wonderful . " Poniewozik was slightly critical of Pam and Jim 's story , noting that in the grand scheme of the show it was successful , but that it makes slightly less sense when one examines it closely ; however , he felt that even " if the details don 't add up , the emotions do " . He concluded that the episode " worked mostly as an epilogue " and allowed the cast of the series to have their final moments . 
 Brian Lowry of Variety positively wrote that the finale " ignored " the last few seasons ' missteps and was " awash in warmth and inside gags " . He concluded that the show " deserved to finish on top " , and that while some of the scenes , such as Dwight 's wedding seemed " a little bit trite " , the resulting product was successful . Michael Tedder of Vulture awarded the episode five stars out of five and wrote that the episode was able to provide solid conclusions for all of the characters . Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an " A – " and wrote that " the quality of this series finale is found in the way it functions right now , in the afterglow of a TV show to which many devoted more than 100 hours of their lives . Some aspects of the episode fall flat , but when it hits , it hits . " Ultimately , he found that " ' Finale ' is not a great piece of television " but that it was the finale that " The Office needed " because it was " the right point to jump off ... the circular track " , due to the series idea of thematic <unk> . Tom Gliatto of People magazine , however , gave the episode a negative review , and wrote that " this episode was poorly conceived and clumsily structured . It really wasn 't worthy of all the years of affectionate humor that had gone before it . " 
 Steve Carell 's cameo received glowing reviews from critics . Campbell noted that he was " glad [ Carell 's ] return was still uncertain [ before the episode aired ] because the reveal was made that much sweeter . " Sepinwall noted that Carell 's return managed to not " overshadow the stories of the people who remained after he left , but which made sense for the characters , and the end of the series . " Adams noted that " Carell doesn ’ t get a lot to say — he ’ s already had his chance to say goodbye — but that just makes each of his lines count more " . Cornet felt that the cameo 's " brevity " was " the perfect amount of Michael for this particular episode " . Poniewozik described it as " a way that as best as possible walked the line between overplaying and underplaying Steve Carell ’ s cameo . " Lowry called it a " perfectly orchestrated cameo " . Basis wrote that the appearance was " pretty great " and that " the notion of Michael finally getting the family he ’ s always wanted was enough to melt the heart of even the nit @-@ <unk> fan . "

 = Dermotherium = 
 Dermotherium is a genus of fossil mammals closely related to the living colugos , a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast Asia . Two species are recognized : D. major from the Late Eocene of Thailand , based on a single fragment of the lower jaw , and D. chimaera from the Late Oligocene of Thailand , known from three fragments of the lower jaw and two isolated upper molars . In addition , a single isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to D. chimaera . All sites where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers like living colugos , but whether they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown . 
 Some features of the teeth differentiate Dermotherium from both living colugo species , but other features are shared with only one of the two . The third lower incisor , lower canine , and third lower premolar at least are pectinate or comblike , bearing longitudinal rows of tines or cusps , an unusual feature of colugos ( the first two lower incisors are unknown in Dermotherium ) . The fourth lower premolar instead resembles the lower molars . The front part of these teeth , the trigonid , is broader in D. chimaera than in D. major , which is known only from the second and third lower molars . The two species also differ in the configuration of the inner back corner of the lower molars . The upper molars are triangular teeth bearing a number of distinct small cusps , particularly on the second upper molar , and with wrinkled enamel .

 <unk> are a small group of Southeast Asian gliding mammals closely related to the primates . Their fossil record is exceptionally poor . Although Paleogene groups such as the <unk> are considered by some to be closely related to colugos , no fossils undoubtedly referable to the living colugo family , <unk> , had been reported until 1992 . In that year , Stéphane <unk> and colleagues described a jaw fragment from the Eocene of Thailand as a new genus and species of colugo , Dermotherium major . In 2000 , however , Brian Stafford and Frederick Szalay argued that Dermotherium might not be a colugo , since the fossil is so poorly preserved that few traits can be unambiguously recognized and some purported <unk> features of the fossil are in fact also seen in other placental groups . Mary <unk> and colleagues reaffirmed the colugo affinities of Dermotherium in 2005 on the basis of detailed similarities in molar morphology . 
 In 2006 , Laurent Marivaux and colleagues described a second species of Dermotherium , D. chimaera , from material from the Oligocene of Thailand . They gave it the specific name chimaera ( Latin for " chimera " ) because it shares characters with both the Philippine colugo ( Cynocephalus volans ) and Sunda colugo ( <unk> variegatus ) , the two living colugo species . In addition , they tentatively identified a fossil from the Oligocene of Pakistan as Dermotherium chimaera and regarded some fossils from the Eocene of Myanmar as indeterminate dermopterans . According to a phylogenetic analysis carried out by Marivaux and colleagues , D. chimaera , D. major , and the Myanmar <unk> are successive sister groups of the two living colugos . 
 = = Description = = 
 Known material of Dermotherium includes a handful of jaw fragments and isolated teeth . Dermotherium major is known only from a fragment of the left lower jaw bearing the third lower molar ( m3 ) and a poorly preserved second lower molar ( m2 ) . The holotype of Dermotherium chimaera is a lower jaw fragment in which remnants of the deciduous third lower premolar are visible . X @-@ ray microtomography reveals the unerupted lower third incisor ( i3 ) , canine ( c1 ) , third premolar ( p3 ) , and fourth premolar ( p4 ) still inside the jaw . In addition , this species is known from two other jaw fragments , one bearing m1 and m2 and the other bearing m2 and m3 , and two isolated molars , an upper first and second molar ( M1 and M2 ) . The tentatively referred material of this species from Pakistan includes a single M2 . 
 The two species of Dermotherium were about as large as the Philippine colugo and larger than the Sunda colugo and differed from both in a number of characteristics of the dentition . Not enough is known of the skeleton of Dermotherium to assess whether the animal already possessed the gliding adaptations of living colugos . The two species are similar in size , but again differ in details of the dentition . In two specimens of D. chimaera , the length and width of the m2 are 5 and 4 @.@ 3 mm and 5 @.@ 4 and 4 @.@ 8 mm respectively ; this tooth is 5 @.@ 4 mm long and 4 @.@ 9 mm wide in the only known specimen of Dermotherium major . The Pakistani M2 of Dermotherium is 4 @.@ 3 mm long and 6 mm wide , compared to 4 @.@ 7 and 6 @.@ 6 mm in the only known M2 of D. chimaera from Thailand . 
 The lower jaw of Dermotherium major resembles that of living colugos in the presence of a strong angular process ( a projecting piece of bone at the lower side of the back of the jawbone ) and a <unk> space ( a flat space behind the last molars ) . The coronoid process ( a projecting piece of bone directly behind the molars ) rises steeply , with its front wall virtually vertical . 
 = = = Lower dentition = = = 
 The i3 of Dermotherium chimaera is an elongate tooth bearing six tines ( narrow , high " fingers " as in a comb ) arranged from front to back . The frontmost is larger , the next four are about equal in size , and the sixth is smaller . The number of tines resembles that seen in the Sunda colugo , which has four to seven ; the Philippine colugo has three to five . The c1 is also an elongate , narrow tooth ; at the front , it is slightly curved towards the midline of the jaw . On the buccal ( outer ) side of this tooth are six cusps , of which the third ( counting from the front ) is the largest . The p3 is similarly elongate and rounded at the front , but it is broader at the back , forming a talonid ( a " heel " of cusps at the back of a tribosphenic tooth ) . There are six cusps on the narrow anterior part of the tooth , and the fifth ( identified as the protoconid ) is by far the largest . On the buccal side of the talonid is a strong cusp , the hypoconid , with a crest , the cristid obliqua , descending from it towards the front . A second , smaller cusp , the hypoconulid , is present on the lingual side of the talonid , connected to the hypoconid by a postcristid . The pectinate ( comb @-@ like ) shape of the anterior teeth is a shared characteristic of the colugos and highly unusual among mammals . Dermotherium chimaera resembles the Sunda colugo in that the c1 and p3 are also pectinate ; in the Philippine colugo , these teeth are not pectinate . 
 In Dermotherium chimaera , the p4 and m1 through m3 are similar to each other ( and unlike the i3 , canine , and p3 ) and appear to form a series of decreasing size from front to back . In D. major , only m2 and m3 are known , but they are similar in morphology and m3 is smaller than m2 . In the Sunda colugo , however , the teeth get larger from p4 to m3 . The p4 and molars have a distinct trigonid ( a triangular group of cusps at the front of a tribosphenic tooth ) and talonid . The trigonid contains strong protoconid and metaconid cusps . The metaconid is stronger than the protoconid in the molars , but it is not clear whether this is the case in the p4 . In the living colugos , the protoconid is higher than the metaconid in both p4 and m1 . The trigonid is longer in the p4 than in the molars . In D. chimaera , the trigonid is broader than in D. major . A low crest , the <unk> , descends from the protoconid lingually and towards the front , forming the front margin of the trigonid ; there is no distinct cusp ( a paraconid ) at the front of the trigonid on the p4 , but this cusp is present in the molars . 
 The talonid contains a hypoconid , hypoconulid , and entoconid and is much wider than the trigonid because the hypoconid is displaced buccally . A cristid obliqua descends from the hypoconid and reaches the protoconid . Although a crest , the <unk> , descends from the back side of the metaconid , ending in a small cusp , the <unk> , it is separated from the entoconid by a notch . The living colugos lack such a strong <unk> . The hypoconulid is near the back lingual margin of the tooth , behind the entoconid . In D. major , this cusp is further to the back than in both D. chimaera and the Sunda colugo , while the two cusps are merged in the Philippine colugo . In D. chimaera , a low crest , the post @-@ hypoconulid cristid , reaches from the hypoconulid to the back lingual corner of the tooth , where a small cuspule , the distocuspid , is located . A long crest , the postcristid , connects the distocuspid to the hypoconid along the posterior side of the tooth . The Philippine colugo is similar , but in D. major , both the distocuspid and the post @-@ hypoconulid cristid are absent , and the Sunda colugo has a weaker distocuspid and a postcristid that does not reach further lingually than the hypoconulid . 
 = = = Upper dentition = = = 
 The upper molars of Dermotherium chimaera are triangular in overall shape and much broader than long , with the narrow end of the triangle pointing lingually . The M2 from Pakistan that was tentatively placed in D. chimaera is slightly smaller than Thai fossils of the species , but otherwise very similar . The crest in front of and behind the major cusps on the buccal side of the tooth , the paracone and metacone , are well @-@ developed , together forming a long W @-@ shaped ridge . D. chimaera resembles the Philippine colugo in that the crests behind the paracone and in front of the metacone form an acute angle with each other , so that together they form a V ; their shape rather resembles an U in the Sunda colugo . A cingulum ( shelf ) is present on the buccal margin of the tooth , but this cingulum is rather weak in the Pakistani fossil . On the M2 , smaller cusps , the paraconule and metaconule , are present on the lingual sides of the paracone and metacone , but on the M1 the paraconule is missing and the metaconule is small and <unk> . The small cusps are better developed in the Pakistani M2 . A third major cusp , the protocone , is present on the lingual side of both upper molars . This crest is displaced towards the front in the living colugos , but less so in D. chimaera . Two strong crests descend from the front and back faces of the protocone in a buccal direction . These crests end in small cusps ( protoconules ) that are directly lingual to the paracone and metacone . The living colugos lack these protoconules . The enamel is wrinkled on the flanks of the paracone and metacone and , in the Thai but not the Pakistani specimens , on the lingual side of the protocone . Enamel wrinkling is also seen in some Philippine colugos .

 Dermotherium major was found in a lignite pit known as Wai Lek in Krabi Province , southwestern Thailand . It is part of the Krabi Basin fauna , which contains at least 40 mammalian genera , mostly artiodactyls but also including some primates , such as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . This fauna has been dated to about 33 to 35 million years ago , during the Late Eocene . 
 Fossils of Dermotherium chimaera come from <unk> Province , further to the north in Thailand . The fossil deposits , located in the Cha Prong pit in a coal mine called Nong Ya <unk> , are dated to the Late Oligocene . Other mammals found here include the rodent <unk> <unk> , the rhinoceros <unk> sp. cf . D. <unk> , the carnivoran <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> bat . 
 Paali Nala , where the M2 tentatively assigned to Dermotherium chimaera was found , is in the Bugti Hills of Balochistan , western Pakistan . The fossil locality , placed stratigraphically in the Bugti Member of the <unk> Formation , is thought to be Early Oligocene in age . The Paali Nala fauna also contains a diverse array of mammals , including many rodents , some primates , and rhinos . 
 The specializations of dermopterans are such that they are dependent on a forested habitat , and reconstructions of the <unk> at Krabi , Nong Ya <unk> , and Paali Nala suggest that all three fossil deposits developed in a humid , tropical forest environment . Their extinction in the Indian subcontinent may have been caused by the development of a drier climate there during the Late Oligocene .
