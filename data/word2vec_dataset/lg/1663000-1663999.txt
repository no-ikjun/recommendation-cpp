 Development for Lost World started shortly after Sonic Colors was finished and took place over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years . Sonic Team sought to streamline the controls , increase the length , and add more diverse levels compared to previous entries in the series . After reviewing the history of the franchise with Sonic Generations , game producer Takashi Iizuka hoped to " deliver a new experience " with Lost World . Development started on PC , with early experiments involving " twisted tube @-@ type level [ s ] " inspired by Jack and the Beanstalk . As the concept " was totally new " , early levels had to be remade " over and over . " Players were given greater ability to control Sonic 's speed in an effort to create a more traditional platforming experience . The parkour mechanic was introduced to maintain a more fluid sense of movement , in contrast to previous Sonic games where running into a wall would force the player to a complete stop . Iizuka stated that " This game is like going into the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland , an action game where you can experience many strange and fun experiences . " 
 Development ultimately focused on the Wii U and 3DS because of the success of previous Sonic titles on Nintendo platforms . Because Wii U " has two monitors to use " , Sonic Team decided to include both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes . The Wii U GamePad 's touch screen and gyroscope were employed to activate the returning Color Powers . The 3DS version , co @-@ developed with Dimps , was designed to " fully utilize " the 3DS hardware with 3D gameplay and motion controls . Development was harder on 3DS due to its more limited processing power . Iizuka stated that the Color Powers are " essential " to the level design of the 3DS version , while they work as an " additional tool " in the Wii U version . A simple art style was used to make objects stand out more against the backgrounds , and to keep the game running at a consistent 60 frames per second . The design of the new " Deadly Six " villains was based on that of an ogre , and each one 's appearance was intended to reflect a certain key characteristic of their personality , which the developers hoped players could see " just by looking at them . " The Wii U version of the game was directed by Morio Kishimoto , the director of Sonic Colors and the lead designer of Sonic and the Black Knight , while the 3DS version was directed by Takao Hirabayashi , the director of Sonic Colors DS . 
 A trademark for the title Sonic Lost World was filed by Sega in May 2013 . The game was first revealed on May 17 , 2013 in a Nintendo Direct announcement , as part of an exclusive partnership between Sega and Nintendo for the Sonic the Hedgehog series . It is one of three games in this partnership , the other ones being the fourth entry to the Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games series , and Sonic Boom , a game based on the animated series of the same name . Sega reported that more on the game would be revealed before the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 convention , and that the game will contain both returning and new original characters , both in enemies and friends of Sonic . On May 23 , 2013 , Sega posted a teaser , showing silhouette images of the Deadly Six , and stating that more would be revealed on May 29 . The first trailer for the game was released on May 28 , a day earlier than previously announced . 
 A downloadable demo of the " Windy Hill Zone 1 " stage was made available for both consoles on October 9 in Japan and in mid @-@ November in North America and Europe . The game 's official soundtrack , titled Without Boundaries , was released via physical media in Japan on November 27 , 2013 and digitally in the United States and Europe on December 2 , 2013 .

 Sonic Lost World received mixed reviews , according to video game review aggregator Metacritic . During its opening week in the UK , Sonic Lost World charted at # 11 on the All @-@ formats chart for sales , but achieved the top spot on the Wii U chart and # 4 on the Nintendo 3DS chart . As of the end of 2013 , Sega had shipped 640 @,@ 000 copies of the game . As of March 31 , 2014 , the game had sold 710 @,@ 000 copies . 
 The game 's presentation was well received . Chris Plante of Polygon praised the Wii U version 's visuals and music as " arguably the best " in the series . Game Informer 's Tim Turi wrote that " The orchestrated tracks evoke Mario Galaxy in the best ways . " GameSpot 's Mark Walton and Computer and Videogames 's Chris Scullion singled out the candy @-@ themed " Dessert Ruins " level as a visual highlight . However , Turi made note of " ultra @-@ compressed " cutscenes in the 3DS version . IGN 's Vince Ingenito was favorable to the " pleasant " art direction and stable framerate , but criticized the " subdued " color palette . Roger Hargreaves of Metro stated that the " imaginative " designs and " spectacular set piece [ s ] " kept him " interested to know what comes next . " Chris Schilling of Eurogamer was even more effusive : " Blue skies forever ! " 
 Strong criticism was directed at the game 's control scheme , especially the new parkour mechanic . Turi " never got a good feel for the rhythm of wall running and jumping , and felt lucky to pass sections where it was forced . " Hargreaves , Walton , and Official Nintendo Magazine 's Matthew Castle agreed . Ingenito found it problematic that Sonic tends to wall @-@ run on every nearby vertical surface . Schilling singled out the multi @-@ lock homing attack , writing that while " most of the time it works perfectly well " , it appeared to " inexplicably fail " on occasion . Ingenito , Turi , and Hargreaves agreed . Matthew Castle of Official Nintendo Magazine struggled with the homing attack " locking on too late or attacking enemies in awkward sequence . " However , GamesRadar 's Justin Towell defended the control scheme , explaining that while it had a learning curve , it also " modernize [ s ] environmental traversal " and " provide [ s ] a distinct safety net " . Towell argued that Sonic was mainly hard to control in the " more complex 2D sections " because there are " so many rules for how Sonic reacts contextually to his environment " . <unk> <unk> of Famitsu stated that the ability to slow down made the game easier to play for beginners . However , Turi criticized Sonic 's " odd sense of momentum " and imprecise jumps , stating that switching between two speeds is " jarring " and produces " touchy platforming " . Schilling excoriated the " profoundly frustrating " controls as the worst in the series , explaining that " Sonic 's too sluggish while walking , and too skittish to cope with the trickier platforming bits when running " . Ingenito agreed : " I 've played a lot of Sonic over the years , and the controls have never felt as alien and inconsistent as they do here . " 
 Several critics felt that Sonic controlled better on the 3DS . IGN 's Jose Otero said the parkour " felt great " and " turned most obstructions into minor hurdles " in this version . Official Nintendo Magazine 's Joe Skrebels felt that Sonic " controls far better at top speed on 3DS " . Kotaku 's Stephen Totilo stated that the 3DS version does a better job of teaching the controls , although Turi derided its " constant , lengthy tutorial text " . However , Schilling called the homing attack " even more capricious " on 3DS . 
 Reaction to the game 's level design was mixed . Turi made note of oddly placed invisible springs in the Wii U version 's " confusing " and " aggravating " levels , and expressed frustration with the 3DS version 's " head @-@ scratching " puzzles . Walton preferred the " inoffensive " 2D sections to the " frustrating mishmash of speed and exploration " found in 3D . Plante praised the Wii U version 's 3D stages as " wildly creative exercises in platforming experimentation " while decrying its 2D stages as " so clunky and tiresome that it 's hard to imagine a time when a side @-@ scrolling Sonic was actually good . " Fellow Polygon writer Philip Kollar was harsher on the 3DS version due to its " confusing and labyrinthine " level design and " awkward puzzles " . Ingenito stated that the Wii U version 's levels were stuck in " design gridlock " and " lack [ ed ] rhythm and cohesion " . Otero praised the 3DS version 's " better levels " as " competently made race tracks full of alternate pathways " , but called the " trial and error " required to complete the " slower @-@ paced 3D stages " " incredibly frustrating " . Castle stated that the Wii U version 's " best stages play to the strengths of Sonic 's tiered speed " , while Skrebels felt the 3DS version featured levels well @-@ suited for handheld play . Totilo praised " the intuitive , flowing , player @-@ friendly levels of the 3DS version " but panned " the badly @-@ explained , choppy , punitive levels of the Wii U version " . Schilling wrote that " I came perilously close to biting my GamePad at one particularly sharp difficulty spike . " Edge noted that " Sonic games , and platformers in general , have always been about memorizing the lay of the land , but rarely have mistakes been so costly or heavily punished . " 
 The alternate gameplay styles polarized many critics . Daniel Cairns of VideoGamer.com and Castle highlighted the level where Sonic becomes a giant snowball as " genuinely excellent " and " a cool riff on Monkey Ball " , whereas Turi and Ingenito described it as " atrocious " , " <unk> [ e ] " and " the exact opposite of fun " . Turi " received multiple game overs during a mundane mandatory pinball sequence . " Walton felt that some of the Wisps were an " amusing aside , " while others suffered from " frustrating motion controls " . GameTrailers ' Justin Speer stated that the Wisps " don 't really feel like they belong " in the Wii U version . Totilo preferred how the Wisps were used in the 3DS version , but Towell stated that while they were " more integral " to the design , they tended to interrupt " the free @-@ form gameplay " with " clumsy mechanic [ s ] " . Towell described the 3DS version 's motion @-@ controlled Special Stages as " borderline unplayable " . Totilo and Castle criticized the Wii U version 's Jetpack Joyride @-@ style flying levels as " regrettable " and " horribly imprecise " . Turi and Totilo criticized the Wii U version 's balloon @-@ popping minigame as " mind @-@ numbing " and " awkward " . Turi called the Wii U version 's co @-@ op mode " useless " . Castle wrote that " Two @-@ player races would be a cool addition were it not for the horrible framerate issues . " 
 The Deadly Six were negatively received . Although Towell enjoyed their " fun , stereotypical personalities " , he was disappointed by their " awful " dialogue . Speer called the boss battles " weirdly anticlimactic " , and Ingenito stated they were " some of the most boring in the series ' history " . Turi referred to the Deadly Six as " generic " , " forgettable " , and " some of the most aggressively annoying villains ever . " 
 Critics disagreed over what to make of the game as a whole . In 2015 , the staff of USgamer referred to Lost World as " perhaps Sonic 's best outing in years . " Destructoid 's Jim Sterling said it " can wildly swing from brilliant to horrific at the drop of a hat , but when one steps back and takes a look at the whole production , one sees far more to love than hate . " Plante noted that " the early stages display a degree of design ingenuity and polish which gradually degrades " . Empire 's David McComb called it " A cheap , cruel , crushing disappointment in the wake of Sonic Colors and Generations . " Walton concluded that " in overtly coveting the great Italian plumber , it smothers the talents of its blazing blue hedgehog . " 
 = Wade Mainer = 
 Wade <unk> Mainer ( April 21 , 1907 – September 12 , 2011 ) was an American country singer and banjoist . With his band , the Sons of the Mountaineers , he is credited with bridging the gap between old @-@ time mountain music and Bluegrass and is sometimes called the " Grandfather of Bluegrass . " In addition , he innovated a two @-@ finger banjo fingerpicking style , which was a precursor to modern three @-@ finger bluegrass styles . 
 Originally from North Carolina , Mainer 's main influences came from the mountain music of his family . In a career that began in 1934 and spanned almost six decades , Mainer transitioned from being a member of his brother 's band into the founder of his own ensemble , the Sons of the Mountaineers , with whom he performed until 1953 , when he became more deeply involved with his Christianity and left the music industry . After working at a General Motors factory and attending gospel revivals , Mainer was convinced that he should restart his career as a Christian gospel musician and began to tour with his wife in this capacity . He continued to release albums until 1993 . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Mainer was born near Weaverville , North Carolina , on a mountain farm in Buncombe County on April 21 , 1907 . His family was poor during his childhood and they lived in a log cabin in the Blue Ridge Mountains . Mainer credited his father who was , in Mainer 's words , " a good singer – real stout voice " , as of one of his influences . During his career as a musical artist , Mainer would perform many of the old songs that he had heard from his father . 
 Mainer grew up listening to traditional mountain music and was largely influenced by his brother @-@ in @-@ law Roscoe Banks . He first learned to play the banjo at square dances , where he would pick up instruments left by performers and practice on them . After moving to Concord , North Carolina and working in a series of jobs at cotton mills , he became a part of his brother J.E. ' s band , known as J. E. Mainer 's Mountaineers . His entry into the band in 1934 marked the beginning of a nearly six @-@ decade career in music . J.E. played the fiddle while Wade performed on the banjo for the string band , and they played at fiddlers ' conventions and other gatherings . 
 Mainer married Julia Mae Brown at the end of 1937 , shortly after forming his own band . Brown was a singer and guitarist popularly know at the time as Hillbilly Lilly . She had performed from 1935 until 1937 at <unk> Radio in Winston @-@ Salem . Brown is considered to be a pioneering female musical artist and later joined Mainer during his performances . 
 = = Musical career = = 
 Mainer 's first recordings came in 1934 and are compiled on Ragged But Right : 30 's Country Bands . Mainer performed with The Mountaineers on tracks such as Maple on the Hill , Seven and a Half and Johnson 's Old Grey Mule . Also included on the compilation are Mainer 's later collaboration Short Life and It 's Trouble with Zeke Morris , his solo effort Riding on That Train 45 and a sample song Mitchell Blues from his band the Sons of the Mountaineers . Throughout his career , he was noted for his unique and innovative two @-@ finger banjo fingerpicking style , which some view as a precursor to three finger bluegrass banjo styles . Mainer took jobs at local radio stations to increase the visibility of his relative 's ensemble , recording classics such as Take Me in the Lifeboat . During this time , he appeared on many regional stations including <unk> in Charlotte , <unk> in Raleigh , <unk> in Knoxville and <unk> in Mount Airy . 
 Mainer performed in a series of live radio shows with The Mountaineers , sponsored by Crazy Water Crystals laxatives . In 1934 , J.W. Fincher , the head of the company , observed their popularity at the first gig , the Crazy Water Crystal Barn Dance , a radio program out of Charlotte . Under the name J. E. Mainer 's Crazy Mountaineers , they toured the American South on live radio shows and recorded fourteen songs for Bluebird Records . Maple on the Hill , which according to the National Endowment for the Arts was their biggest hit , had originally been composed in the 1890s by Gussie L. Davis . 
 Mainer was in his brother J.E. ' s band for two years , until he left for more traditional work , which at the time was far more profitable than his musical career . Making only five dollars a week under sponsorship , Mainer found that he could earn up to three times as much working at a yarn mill , which he described as being " gold " for the era . After leaving his brother 's group in 1936 , he began to perform duet work with Zeke Morris , who was a band mate from The Mountaineers . After a time working on this project , Mainer left to form the short @-@ lived " Smilin ' Rangers " which later became " Sons of the Pioneers " . Zeke Morris then got together with his brother Wiley to form The Morris Brothers . 
 = = = Sons of the Mountaineers = = = 
 Mainer named this new band Sons of the Mountaineers . Its initial lineup included Jay Hugh Hall and Clyde Moody as guitarists with Steve Ledford as a fiddler . Among the musicians who would join the group later were Jack and Curly Shelton , Tiny Dodson , Red Rector and Fred Smith . The band got its start performing on the radio and recording songs for Bluebird Records and their first hit , entitled " Sparkling Blue Eyes " was recorded in 1939 . From 1935 through 1941 , Mainer recorded over 165 songs for the record label RCA Victor in various lineups , ranking him among one of the most prolifically recorded country music artists of that period . 
 The Sons of the Mountaineers briefly stopped playing during World War II because Mainer could not afford to squander the valuable gasoline required for the journey to the radio stations . One notable exception , however , came in 1942 , when they were invited to the White House by Eleanor Roosevelt . There in Washington D.C. , they played several tunes , including " Down in the Willow Garden " , a song personally requested by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt . During this time , they also appeared in a version of The Chisholm Trail in New York . At wars ' end , the band was reorganized and once again began to play at stations across North Carolina . Recordings at this time were sporadic , due to the declining popularity of the genre . In 1953 , after having renewed his commitment to Christianity , Mainer left the group and exited the industry for a time . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In 1953 , Mainer and his wife settled in Flint , Michigan , where he found work at a General Motors factory . Although renouncing both the music industry and his trademark instrument , the banjo , he and Julia did continue to sing at gospel revival meetings . In the early 1960s , Molly O 'Day convinced him that he could use the banjo in gospel recordings , which spurred a series of religiously themed banjo albums beginning in 1961 . He also began to record and tour with his wife . 
 Mainer retired from General Motors in 1973 . Mainer has been credited with bridging the gap between old @-@ time mountain music and Bluegrass and musicians such as Bill Monroe , Ralph Stanley and Doc Watson have all cited Mainer as a source of influence . He has also been called the " Grandfather of Bluegrass . " His influence was not limited to the United States . Pete Smith , of the British newspaper The Advertiser , in a report for Mainer 's 100th birthday , cited Mainer as " one of the most influential figures in the development of modern bluegrass , " noting his picking style and his efforts in bringing bluegrass closer to the mainstream . In addition , Smith also credits him for making the banjo , an instrument previously described as " satanic , " acceptable for spiritually @-@ themed music . Mainer continued to live with his wife in Flint , where he celebrated his centenary in 2007 and performed at a concert for his 101st birthday in 2008 . Mainer died of congestive heart failure on September 12 , 2011 . He was 104 .

 The IG Farben Building , officially known as the Poelzig Building , is a building complex in Frankfurt , Germany , which currently serves as the main campus of the University of Frankfurt . It was built from 1928 to 1930 as the corporate headquarters of the IG Farben conglomerate , then the world 's largest chemical company and the world 's fourth largest company overall . 
 The building 's original design in the modernist New Objectivity style was the subject of a competition which was eventually won by the architect Hans Poelzig . On its completion , the complex was the largest office building in Europe and remained so until the 1950s . The IG Farben Building 's six square wings retain a modern , spare elegance , despite its mammoth size . It is also notable for its paternoster elevators . 
 The building was the headquarters for production administration of dyes , pharmaceutical drugs , magnesium , lubricating oil , explosives , and methanol , and for research projects relating to the development of synthetic oil and rubber during World War II . After World War II , the IG Farben Building served as the headquarters for the Supreme Allied Command and from 1949 to 1952 the High Commissioner for Germany ( <unk> ) . It became the principal location for implementing the Marshall Plan , which supported the post @-@ war reconstruction of Europe . The IG Farben Building served as the headquarters for the US Army 's V Corps and the Northern Area Command ( <unk> ) until 1995 . The US Army renamed the building the General Creighton W. Abrams Building in 1975 . 
 In 1995 , the US Army transferred the IG Farben Building to the German government , and it was purchased by the state of Hesse on behalf of the University of Frankfurt . Renamed the Poelzig Building in honour of its architect , the building underwent a restoration and was opened as part of the university in 2001 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = The site = = = 
 The IG Farben Building was developed on land known as the <unk> in Frankfurt 's Westend District . In 1837 , the property belonged to the Rothschild family . In 1864 , the city 's psychiatric hospital known as " <unk> " or " <unk> " ' , was erected on the site . The name <unk> derives from an ancient Christian memorial that once stood here on the road outside Frankfurt . It was known as the " <unk> " as in Ave Maria but in the local Frankfurt dialect it was called the " <unk> Stein " . Here , Dr Heinrich Hoffman hired Alois Alzheimer to work in the hospital , where they both explored progressive methods of treating the mentally ill . The <unk> was established in 1880 on the larger western part of the site . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 IG Farben acquired the property in 1927 to establish its headquarters there . In the 1920s , IG Farben ( full German name <unk> Gemeinschaft <unk> Aktiengesellschaft ) was the world 's largest drug , chemical and dye conglomerate . Frankfurt was chosen because of its centrality and its accessibility by air and land . 
 In August 1928 , Professor Hans Poelzig won a limited competition to design the building , among five selected architects , notably beating Ernst May , the then Head of Urban Design for Frankfurt . 
 Work on the foundations began in late 1928 , and in mid @-@ 1929 construction started on the steel frame . The building was completed in 1930 after only 24 months , by employing rapid @-@ setting concrete , new construction materials and a round @-@ the @-@ clock workforce . Later in 1930 , the Frankfurt director of horticulture Max <unk> and the artists ' group <unk> Kreis developed designs for the 14 hectares of parkland that surrounded the building . The grounds , and the complex as a whole , were completed in 1931 at a total cost of 24 million Reichsmark ( 150 million DEM , 76 @.@ 8 million EUR in 2016 ) . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 IG Farben subsequently became an indispensable part of the Nazi industrial base . The building was the headquarters for research projects for the development of wartime synthetic oil and rubber , as well as the production administration of magnesium , lubricating oil , explosives , and methanol . The building was used by IG Farben for 15 years . 
 During World War II , the surrounding neighbourhood was devastated , but the building itself was left largely intact ( and inhabited by the homeless citizens of a bomb @-@ ravaged Frankfurt ) . In March 1945 , Allied troops occupied the area and the IG Farben Building became the American headquarters of General Dwight D. Eisenhower . Eisenhower 's office was where he received many important guests ; including General de Gaulle , Field Marshal Montgomery and Marshal Zhukov . It was there that he signed the " Proclamation No. 2 " , which determined which parts of the country would be within the American zone . Eisenhower vacated the building in December 1945 but his office was still used for special occasions : the constitution of the state of Hesse was signed there , the West German <unk> received his commission to compile the <unk> ( German constitution ) and the administration of the <unk> der <unk> ( Economic Council of the <unk> ) was also located there . 
 = = = Cold War = = = 
 From 1945 to 1947 , the IG Farben Building was the location of the Supreme Headquarters , Allied European Forces , and was the headquarters for the US occupation forces and Military Governor . On May 10 , 1947 , permanent orders to military personnel prohibited further reference to the building as the " IG Farben Building " , and instead called for it to be referred to as " The Headquarters Building , European Command " . The United States High Commissioner for Germany ( <unk> ) and his staff occupied the building from 1949 to 1952 . 
 After 1952 , the building served as the European centre of the American armed forces and the headquarters of the U.S. V Corps . It later became the headquarters for the Northern Area Command until 1994 . The IG Farben Building was also the headquarters of the CIA in Germany , which led to its sobriquet ' the Pentagon of Europe ' . On April 16 , 1975 , the US Army renamed the building the General Creighton W. Abrams Building . The renaming did not have full authority in law , because the US was technically leasing the building from the German government and thus was not the rightful owner . 
 On May 11 , 1972 , three bombs were set off by the West German terrorist group Rote Armee <unk> ( Red Army Faction , i.e. , the Baader @-@ Meinhof Group ) . Two bombs went off in a rotunda in the rear entrance of the IG Farben building , and a third exploded in a smaller building behind the IG Farben building that was serving as the US Military 's officer 's club . Lt. Col. Paul Bloomquist was killed by the last bomb , and dozens of Americans and Germans were injured . The IG Farben building was attacked again by the same group in 1976 and 1982 . Consequently , the publicly accessible adjoining park became part of a restricted military zone which also included the military living quarters and work areas at the rear of the building . 
 = = = Recent years = = = 
 Following German reunification , the US government announced plans to fully withdraw its troops from Frankfurt , Germany by 1995 , at which time control of the entire site would be restored to the German Federal Government . It was suggested that the building could become the location for the European Central Bank . In 1996 , the state of Hesse bought the building and associated land for the University of Frankfurt . The buildings were refurbished at a cost of 50 Million German Mark ( about US $ <unk> or 25M € ) , by the Copenhagen @-@ based architecture practice Dissing + Weitling and were handed over to the university . The complex now houses the Westend Campus of the university , which includes the departments of Philosophy , History , Theology , Classical Philology , Art and Music , Modern Languages and Linguistics , Cultural and Civilization Studies , the Center for North American Studies and the Fritz @-@ Bauer @-@ Institute . 
 = = = Renaming controversy = = = 
 The university 's tenancy of the building sparked a debate regarding the name of the building . Former University President Werner Meissner had started the controversy by renaming it the " Poelzig @-@ Ensemble " ( Poelzig @-@ Complex ) ; to him , renaming the building would free it from associations with Nazism . Students and , in increasing numbers , members of the faculty insisted on confronting the building 's history by retaining its original name , the " IG Farben Building " . Meissner 's successor , Rudolf Steinberg , upheld the university 's decision to retain the name , but he did not enforce a uniform nomenclature within the university 's administration . After the grand opening of the building in 2001 , <unk> chairman <unk> <unk> Walter objected to the " misuse of Hans Poelzig " [ sic ] and proposed leaving the name of the main building unchanged , and calling the smaller casino building the " Poelzig Casino " ; this proposal won little support . By 2004 , the " Poelzig @-@ Ensemble " proposal had become a moot point — the debate was overtaken by strong political lobbying for an appropriate commemoration and memorial of remembrance : Vice President Brita Rank set up a permanent exhibition inside the building , and a memorial plaque — for the slave labourers of IG Farben and those who had perished by Zyklon B gas — was installed on the front of the building . The Senate of the University agreed on a joint initiative by the student senator of the Green University group , David Profit , and Angelika Marx the senator of the United Services Union , to name a place on the new campus 's western end after the former slave labourer Norbert Wollheim . 
 Despite the renamings by the University and the American military administration , the building is still usually called the IG Farben Building by the general public . The association of the building with Nazism has been hard to shake off , partly because of the close involvement of IG Farben with the Nazi regime and partly because of the building 's imposing and monumental appearance . Der Spiegel wrote of its " Smell of Guilt " . Only with the departure of the Americans , the subsequent renovations , and the use of the building by the university has the building 's association with the Third Reich in the popular consciousness receded . As of 2010 , the building is referred to as IG Farben <unk> on the campus map . 
 = = = Future = = = 
 Behind the IG Farben Building , the state of Hesse intends to build " Europe 's most modern campus " to accommodate the remaining departments of the University 's old <unk> campus , law , business , social sciences , child development , and the arts . 
 = = Building = = 
 In 1928 , IG Farben was the world 's fourth largest company and its largest chemical company . Consequently , the space requirements for the building were for one of the largest office buildings ever constructed . It was designed in the New Objectivity style . 
 IG Farben did not want a specifically ' Bauhaus ' styled building — it wanted : 
 A symbol , in iron and stone , of German commercial and scientific manpower . Baron von Schnitzler , IG Farben Director , 1930 . 
 The 250 @-@ metre long and 35 @-@ metre tall building has nine floors , but the height of the ground floor varies ( 4 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 2 m ) . This variation is reflected in the roof line which looks taller at the wings than the spine . The volume of the building is 280 @,@ 000 m ³ , constructed from 4 @,@ 600 tonnes of steel frame with brick infill and floors constructed of hollow blocks to provide over <unk> m ² of usable office space " . The façade is clad with 33 @,@ 000 m ² Stuttgart @-@ Bad <unk> <unk> marble , punctuated in bands of windows decreasing in height with each storey . Only at the corners are the glazed strips interrupted for emphasis . The top storey is lit from skylights rather than banded glazing and has a very low ceiling height . It forms a clear building conclusion . Until the 1950s , the building was the largest and most modern office building in Europe . 
 The IG Farben Building consists of six wings , connected by a gently curved , central corridor . This arrangement provides all of the offices with sufficient natural light and ventilation . This design approach for large complexes offers an alternative to the " hollow rectangle " schemes of the time , with their typical inner courtyards . The prototype of this form is the General Motors Building in Detroit ( 1917 – 21 ) by Albert Kahn . The building presents a very large and weighty façade to the front , but this effect is reduced by the concave form . 
 The main entrance is at the axial centre of the building , comprising a temple @-@ like portico standing in front of the doors — a relatively common motif of administration buildings of the time . The entrance arrangement is regarded by some people as slightly pompous : the entrance and lift doors are of bronze , and the ceiling and walls of the porch are clad in bronze plate and copper friezes . The inner lobby has two curved staircases with a sheet aluminum treatment , and marble walls with a zigzag pattern . The axial centre at the rear of the building has a round glazed façade ; here , the view of the buildings at the rear of the site ( the " casino " ) is maximised by the curved walls that afford vistas to the subsidiary buildings 100 m distant , separated from the main building by parkland and a pool . During the American occupation of the building , this rotunda housed a small kiosk ; later , it was used as a conference room . Nowadays , it is called the Dwight D. Eisenhower room and accommodates a café . 
 The paternoster lifts that serve the nine floors are famous , and are popular with the university students . After the recent restoration , the university has pledged to preserve them in perpetuity . 
 Behind the rotunda is an oblong pool with a <unk> ( German : Nymph sculpture ) at the water 's edge created by Fritz Klimsch entitled " Am Wasser " . Behind it stands a flat building on a hill with a terrace — the casino of IG Farben and the Officers Club of the US Army ( " The Terrace Club " ) , which now houses a refectory and lecture @-@ rooms . 
 = = Rumours = = 
 A number of unconfirmed rumours concern the complex : 
 Hans Poelzig was not favoured by the Nazi regime and was banned by IG Farben from entering the building after its completion . 
 General Eisenhower issued orders to preserve the building during the bombardment of Frankfurt , because he intended to use it after the war as his headquarters . It may also have been that the building was saved by its proximity to <unk> with its prisoner of war camp holding captured American airmen . 
 Two or three basements are under the Poelzig building , which are sealed and flooded . 
 A tunnel connects the building with Frankfurt 's main railway station ; some sources contend that only the main building and the casino are linked , and that there is no tunnel to the station . 
 At the reflecting pool behind the building , the " Am Wasser " sculpture of a naked water nymph was moved during the American occupation . The nymph was moved to the Hoechst Chemical concern in Frankfurt / Hoechst at the request of Mamie Eisenhower ( the general 's wife ) , who deemed it inappropriate for a military installation . The statue has since been returned to its original location . 
 = Casino Royale ( novel ) = 
 Casino Royale is the first novel by the British author Ian Fleming . Published in 1953 , it is the first James Bond book , and it paved the way for a further eleven novels and two short story collections by Fleming , followed by numerous continuation Bond novels by other authors . 
 The story concerns the British secret agent James Bond , gambling at the casino in Royale @-@ les @-@ Eaux to bankrupt Le Chiffre , the treasurer of a French union and a member of the Russian secret service . Bond is supported in his endeavours by Vesper Lynd , a member of his own service , as well as Felix Leiter of the CIA and René Mathis of the French Deuxième Bureau . Fleming used his wartime experiences as a member of the Naval Intelligence Division , and the people he met during his work , to provide plot elements ; the character of Bond also reflected many of Fleming 's personal tastes . Fleming wrote the draft in early 1952 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica while awaiting his marriage . He was initially unsure whether the work was suitable for publication , but was assured by his friend , the novelist William Plomer , that the novel had promise . 
 Within the spy storyline , Casino Royale deals with themes of Britain 's position in the world , particularly the relationship with the US in light of the defections to the Soviet Union of the British traitors Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean . The book was given broadly positive reviews by critics at the time and sold out in less than a month after its UK release on 13 April 1953 , although US sales upon release a year later were much slower . 
 Since publication Casino Royale has appeared as a comic strip in a British national newspaper , The Daily Express . It has been also adapted for the screen three times : a 1954 episode of the CBS television series Climax ! with Barry Nelson as an American Bond , a 1967 film version with David Niven playing " Sir James Bond " , and a 2006 film in the Eon Productions film series starring Daniel Craig as James Bond .

As part of Bond 's cover as a rich Jamaican playboy , M also assigns as his companion Vesper Lynd , personal assistant to the Head of Section S ( Soviet Union ) . The CIA and the French Deuxième Bureau also send agents as observers . The game soon turns into an intense confrontation between Le Chiffre and Bond ; Le Chiffre wins the first round , cleaning Bond out of his funds . As Bond contemplates the prospect of reporting his failure to M , the CIA agent , Felix Leiter , gives him an envelope of money and a note : " Marshall Aid . Thirty @-@ two million francs . With the compliments of the USA . " The game continues , despite the attempts of one of Le Chiffre 's minders to kill Bond . Bond eventually wins , taking from Le Chiffre eighty million francs belonging to SMERSH . 
 Desperate to recover the money , Le Chiffre kidnaps Lynd and subjects Bond to brutal torture , threatening to kill them both if he does not get the money back . During the torture session , a SMERSH assassin enters and kills Le Chiffre as punishment for losing the money . The agent does not kill Bond , saying that he has no orders to do so , but cuts a Cyrillic ' Ш ' ( sh ) to signify the <unk> ( Russian for spy ) into Bond 's hand so that future SMERSH agents will be able to identify him as such . 
 Lynd visits Bond every day as he recuperates in hospital , and he gradually realises that he loves her ; he even contemplates leaving the Secret Service to settle down with her . When he is released from hospital they spend time together at a quiet guest house and eventually become lovers . One day they see a mysterious man named Gettler tracking their movements , which greatly distresses Lynd . The following morning , Bond finds that she has committed suicide . She leaves behind a note explaining that she had been working as an unwilling double agent for the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs . SMERSH had kidnapped her lover , a Polish Royal Air Force pilot , who had revealed information about her under torture ; SMERSH then used that information to blackmail her into helping them undermine Bond 's mission , including her own faked kidnapping . She had tried to start a new life with Bond , but upon seeing Gettler — a SMERSH agent — she realised that she would never be free of her tormentors , and that staying with Bond would only put him in danger . Bond informs his service of Lynd 's duplicity , coldly telling his contact , " The bitch is dead now . "

 Ian Fleming , born in 1908 , was a son of Valentine Fleming , a wealthy banker and MP who died in action on the Western Front in May 1917 . Educated at Eton , Sandhurst and , briefly , the universities of Munich and Geneva , Fleming moved through several jobs before he was recruited by Rear Admiral John Godfrey , the Director of Naval Intelligence , to become his personal assistant . Fleming joined the organisation full @-@ time in August 1939 , with the codename " 17F " , and worked for them throughout the war . Early in 1939 he began an affair with Ann O 'Neill ( née Charteris ) , who was married to the 3rd Baron O 'Neill . 
 In 1942 Fleming attended an Anglo @-@ American intelligence summit in Jamaica and , despite the constant heavy rain during his visit , he decided to live on the island once the war was over . His friend Ivar Bryce helped find a plot of land in Saint Mary Parish where , in 1945 , Fleming had a house built , which he named Goldeneye . The name of the house and estate has many possible sources . Fleming mentioned both his wartime Operation Goldeneye and Carson McCullers ' 1941 novel Reflections in a Golden Eye , which described the use of British naval bases in the Caribbean by the US Navy . 
 Upon Fleming 's demobilisation in May 1945 , he became the Foreign Manager in the Kemsley newspaper group , which at the time owned The Sunday Times . In this role he oversaw the paper 's worldwide network of correspondents . His contract allowed him to take two months holiday every winter in Jamaica . In 1948 Charteris gave birth to Fleming 's daughter , Mary , who was stillborn ; Charteris and Fleming became engaged shortly in 1951 . 
 Fleming had previously mentioned to friends that he wanted to write a spy novel , but it was not until early 1952 , to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials , that he began to write Casino Royale at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica on 17 February ; he typed out 2 @,@ 000 words in the morning , directly from his own experiences and imagination , and finished work on the manuscript in March 1952 . It was a pattern he retained for future Bond books . In May 1963 he wrote a piece for Books and Bookmen magazine in which he said : " I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour 's work between six and seven in the evening . I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula , you write 2 @,@ 000 words a day . " 
 Back in London , Fleming had his manuscript — which he described as his " dreadful oafish opus " — retyped by Joan Howe , his red @-@ haired secretary at The Times on whom the character Miss Moneypenny was partly based . Clare Blanchard , a former girlfriend , advised him not to publish the book , or at least to do so under a pseudonym . During the book 's final draft stages , Fleming allowed his friend , and later editor , William Plomer to see a copy , and remarked " I really am thoroughly ashamed of it ... after rifling through this muck you will probably never speak to me again , but I have got to take that chance . " Despite this , Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape . At first they were unenthusiastic , but were persuaded to publish on the recommendation of Fleming 's older brother , Peter , an established travel writer whose books they managed . 
 Although Fleming provided no dates within his novels , two writers have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole . John Griswold and Henry Chancellor — both of whom have written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications — put the events of Casino Royale in 1951 ; Griswold allows a possible second timeframe and considers the story could have taken place in either May to July 1951 , or May to July 1952 . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Plot inspirations = = = 
 Casino Royale was inspired by certain incidents that took place during Fleming 's wartime career at the Naval Intelligence Division ( NID ) , or by events of which he was aware . On a trip to Portugal , en route to the United States , Fleming and the NID Director , Admiral Godfrey , went to the Estoril Casino . Because of Portugal 's neutral status , Estoril 's population had been swelled by spies and agents from the warring regimes . Fleming claimed that while there he was cleaned out by a " chief German agent " at a table playing chemin de fer . Admiral Godfrey told a different story : that Fleming only played Portuguese businessmen , and afterwards fantasised about playing against German agents . 
 The failed attempt to kill Bond while at Royale @-@ Les @-@ Eaux was inspired by Fleming 's knowledge of the attempted assassination of Franz von Papen , Vice @-@ Chancellor of Germany and an ambassador under Hitler . Both Papen and Bond survived their assassination attempts , carried out by Bulgarians , because trees protected them from the blasts . The torture scene in which Bond 's genitals are thrashed while he is strapped to a bottomless chair was a version of a French @-@ Moroccan torture technique , passer à la mandolin , in which the steel string of a mandolin was used to slice in half the testicles of British wartime agents . 
 Fleming also included four references in the novel to " Red Indians " , including twice on last page , which came from a unit of commandos , known as No. 30 Commando or 30 Assault Unit ( 30AU ) , composed of specialist intelligence troops . The unit was Fleming 's idea , and he nicknamed the troops his " Red Indians " , although they disliked the name . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The lead character of Casino Royale is James Bond , an agent of the Secret Service . Fleming initially named the character James Secretan before he appropriated the name of James Bond , author of the ornithology guide , Birds of the West Indies . Fleming explained to the ornithologist 's wife " that this brief , unromantic , Anglo @-@ Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed , and so a second James Bond was born " . He further explained that " When I wrote the first one in 1953 , I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull , uninteresting man to whom things happened ; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God , [ James Bond ] is the dullest name I ever heard . " 
 Fleming decided that Bond should resemble both the American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself , and in the novel Lynd remarks that " Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael , but there is something cold and ruthless . " According to Andrew Lycett , Fleming 's biographer , " within the first few pages ... [ Fleming ] had introduced most of Bond 's idiosyncrasies and trademarks " , which included his looks , his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits . The full details of Bond 's martini were kept until chapter seven of the book and Bond eventually named it " The Vesper " , after Lynd . Bond 's order , to be served in a deep champagne goblet , was for " three measures of Gordon 's , one of vodka , half a measure of Kina Lillet . Shake it very well until it 's ice @-@ cold , then add a large thin slice of lemon peel . " 
 Speaking of Bond 's origins , Fleming said that " he was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war " , although the author gave many of his own traits to the character . Bond 's tastes are often taken from Fleming 's own , as is some of his behaviour : Fleming used the casino to introduce Bond in his first novel because " skill at gambling and knowledge of how to behave in a casino were seen ... as attributes of a gentleman " . Lycett sees much of Bond 's character as being " wish fulfilment " by Fleming . 
 Bond 's superior , M , was largely based on Godfrey , Fleming 's NID superior officer ; Godfrey was known for his bellicose and irascible temperament . One of the likely models for Le Chiffre was the influential English occultist , astrologer , mystic and ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley , on whose physical features Fleming based Le Chiffre 's . Crowley 's tastes , especially in sado @-@ masochism , were also ascribed to Le Chiffre ; as Fleming 's biographer Henry Chancellor notes , " when Le Chiffre goes to work on Bond 's testicles with a carpet @-@ beater and a carving knife , the sinister figure of Aleister Crowley is there lurking in the background . "

 Fleming later said of his work , " while thrillers may not be Literature with a capital L , it is possible to write what I can best describe as ' thrillers designed to be read as literature ' " . He used well @-@ known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism , which the author Kingsley Amis called " the Fleming effect " . Amis describes it as " the imaginative use of information , whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond 's world ... [ is ] bolted down to some sort of reality , or at least counter @-@ balanced . " Within the text the novelist Raymond Benson — who later wrote a series of Bond novels — identifies what he described as the " Fleming Sweep " , the use of " hooks " at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next . The hooks combine with what the novelist Anthony Burgess calls " a heightened journalistic style " to produce " a speed of narrative , which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery " . 
 The semiotician and essayist , Umberto Eco , in his 1979 examination of the Bond books , " The Narrative Structure of Ian Fleming " , considered that Fleming " has a rhythm , a polish , a certain sensuous feeling for words . That is not to say that Fleming is an artist ; yet he writes with art . " When examining the passage relating to the death of Le Chiffre , Eco wrote that " there is a ... baroque feeling for the image , a total adaptation off the image without emotional comment , and a use of words that designate things with accuracy " , and he went on to conclude that " Fleming is more literate than he gives one to understand . " 
 = = Themes = = 
 Casino Royale was written after , and was heavily influenced by , the Second World War ; Britain was still an imperial power , and the Western and Eastern blocs were engaged in the Cold War . The journalist William Cook observes that with the decline in power of the British Empire , " Bond pandered to Britain 's inflated and increasingly insecure self @-@ image , flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight . " The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett agree , and consider that " Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining . " 
 In 1953 parts of central London , including Oxford Street and High Holborn still had uncleared bomb sites and , while sweets had ceased being rationed , coal and other food items were still regulated . According to The Times journalist and historian Ben Macintyre , Bond was " the ideal antidote to Britain 's postwar austerity , rationing and the looming premonition of lost power " . 
 Casino Royale deals with the question of Anglo @-@ American relations , reflecting the real @-@ world central role of the US in the defence of the West . The academic Jeremy Black points to the 1951 defections of two members of MI6 — Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean — to the Soviet Union as having a major impact on how Britain was poorly viewed in US intelligence circles ; Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries , but he did not focus on it too strongly , and Bond and Leiter 's warm relationship did not reflect the reality of the US @-@ UK relationship . 
 Amis , in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier , pointed out that Leiter is " such a nonentity as a piece of characterization ... he , the American , takes orders from Bond , the Britisher , and that Bond is constantly doing better than he " . The journalist and author Christopher Hitchens observed that " the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that , although superficially devoted to the Anglo @-@ American war against communism , they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans " . David Seed , in his examination of spy fiction , disagrees , and writes that while Bond beats Le Chiffre , his " activities are constantly supported by American agencies , financing and know @-@ how " . 
 The treachery of Le Chiffre , with the overtones of a fifth column , struck a chord with the largely British readership as Communist influence in the trade unions had been an issue in the press and parliament at the time . Britain had also suffered from defections to the Soviet Union from two MI5 operatives who were part of the Cambridge Five spy ring that betrayed Western secrets to the Soviets . Thus Lycett observes that Casino Royale can be seen as Fleming 's " attempt to reflect the disturbing moral ambiguity of a post @-@ war world that could produce traitors like Burgess and Maclean " . The journalist and writer Matthew Parker observes that with the defections of the two spies so recent to the publication , it was " perhaps the closest Fleming came to a [ John ] le Carré @-@ style spy story " . Chancellor sees the moral ambiguity of the Cold War reflected in the novel . 
 Benson considers the most obvious theme of the novel to be good versus evil . Parker agrees , and highlights a conversation between Bond and <unk> in the chapter titled " The Nature of Evil " , in which Bond says : " By ... [ Le Chiffre 's ] evil existence ... he was creating a norm of badness by which , and by which alone , an opposite norm of goodness could exist . " The subject was also dealt with by the academic Beth Butterfield , in an examination of Bond from an existentialist viewpoint . In light of Bond 's conversation , Butterfield identifies a crisis of confidence in Bond 's character , where he has " moved beyond good and evil " to the point where he does his job not because of principles , but to pursue personal battles . Eco comes to the same conclusion , stating that Bond " abandon [ s ] the treacherous life of moral mediation and of psychological anger , with all the dangers they entail . " 
 Black also identifies a mechanism Fleming uses in Casino Royale — and in subsequent Bond novels — which is to use the evil of his opponents both as a justification of his actions , and as a device to foil their own plans . Black refers to the episode of the attempted assassination of Bond by Bulgarian assassins which results in their own deaths .

 Casino Royale was first released on 13 April 1953 in the UK as a hardback edition by publishers Jonathan Cape , with a cover devised by Fleming . Cape printed 4 @,@ 728 copies of Casino Royale , which sold out in less than a month ; a second print run the same month also sold out , as did a third run of more than 8 @,@ 000 books published in May 1954 . The sales figures were strong enough for Cape to offer Fleming a three @-@ book deal . In April 1955 Pan Books issued a paperback version and sold 41 @,@ 000 copies in the first year . 
 In the US three publishers turned the book down before Macmillan Publishing Co offered Fleming a deal . Casino Royale was published on 23 March 1954 in the US , but sales were poor , totalling only 4 @,@ 000 copies across the entire US during the course of the year . When the novel was released as a US paperback in 1955 , it was re @-@ titled by publisher American Popular Library ; Fleming 's suggestions for a new title , The Double @-@ O Agent and The Deadly Gamble , were disregarded in favour of You Asked for It , but this marketing ploy failed to raise the interest . The Popular Library version also changed Bond 's name , calling him " Jimmy Bond " .

 Hugh I <unk> <unk> , writing in The Manchester Guardian , thought that Casino Royale was " a first @-@ rate thriller ... with a breathtaking plot " . Although he considered the book to be " schoolboy stuff " , he felt the novel was " galvanised into life by the hard brilliance of the telling " . Alan Ross , writing in The Times Literary Supplement wrote that Casino Royale was " an extremely engaging affair " , and that " the especial charm ... is the high poetry with which he invests the green baize lagoons of the casino tables " . He concluded that the book was " both exciting and extremely civilized " . Reviewing for The Listener , Simon Raven believed that Fleming was a " kind of supersonic John Buchan " , but he was somewhat dismissive of the plot , observing that it is " a brilliant but improbable notion " that includes " a deal of champagne @-@ drinking , bomb @-@ throwing , relentless pitting of wits etc ... with a cretinous love @-@ affair " . Raven also dismissed Bond as an " infantile " creation , but did allow that " Fleming tells a good story with strength and distinction ... his creation of a scene , both visually and emotionally , is of a very high order indeed . " 
 John Betjeman , writing in The Daily Telegraph , considered that " Ian Fleming has discovered the secret of the narrative art ... which is to work up to a climax unrevealed at the end of each chapter . Thus the reader has to go on reading " . Publishers Jonathan Cape included many of the reviews on their advertisements for the book , which appeared in a number of national newspapers ; the reviews included those from The Sunday Times , which concluded that Fleming was " the best new English thriller @-@ writer since [ Eric ] Ambler " and The Observer , which advised their readers : " don 't miss this " . 
 The critic for Time magazine examined Raymond Chandler 's The Long Goodbye alongside Casino Royale ; he praised Casino Royale , saying that " Fleming keeps his incidents and characters spinning through their paces like juggling balls . " The Time reviewer went on to say that " As for Bond , he might be [ Philip ] Marlowe 's younger brother except that he never takes coffee for a bracer , just one large Martini laced with vodka . " 
 Writing for The New York Times , Anthony Boucher wrote that the book belongs " pretty much to the private @-@ eye school " of fiction . He praised the first part , saying that Fleming " manages to make baccarat clear even to one who 's never played it and produced as exciting a gambling sequence as I 've ever read . But then he decides to pad out the book to novel length and leads the weary reader through a set of tough clichés to an ending which surprises nobody save Operative 007 . You should certainly begin this book ; but you might as well stop when the baccarat game is over . "

 In 1954 CBS paid Ian Fleming $ 1 @,@ 000 to adapt Casino Royale into a one @-@ hour television adventure as part of its Climax ! series . The episode aired live on 21 October 1954 and starred Barry Nelson as secret agent " Card Sense " James ' Jimmy ' Bond and Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre . A brief tutorial on baccarat is given at the beginning of the show by the presenter of the programme , William Lundigan , to enable viewers to understand a game which was not popular in America at the time . For this Americanised version of the story , Bond is an American agent , described as working for " Combined Intelligence " , while the character Leiter from the original novel is British , renamed " Clarence Leiter " . The agent for Station S. , Mathis , does not appear as such ; his surname is given to the leading lady , named Valérie Mathis instead of Vesper Lynd . 
 In March 1955 Ian Fleming sold the film rights of Casino Royale to the producer Gregory Ratoff for $ 6 @,@ 000 . After Ratoff 's death , producer Charles K. Feldman represented Ratoff 's widow and obtained the rights to make a film version . Feldman decided the best way to profit from the film rights was to make a satirical version , which was produced and released in 1967 by Columbia Pictures . The film , which cast David Niven as Bond , was made with five credited directors ( plus one uncredited ) and a cast that included Peter Sellers , Ursula Andress , Orson Welles and Woody Allen . The 1967 version is described by the British Film Institute as " an incoherent all @-@ star comedy " . 
 Casino Royale was the first James Bond novel to be adapted as a daily comic strip ; it was published in The Daily Express and syndicated worldwide . The strip ran from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958 , and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky . To aid The Daily Express in illustrating Bond , Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of what he believed James Bond to look like . McLusky felt that Fleming 's 007 looked too " outdated " and " pre @-@ war " and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look . 
 Following the 1967 adaptation , the rights to the film remained with Columbia Films until 1989 when the studio , and the rights to their intellectual property portfolio was acquired by the Japanese company Sony . In 1999 , following legal action between Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM / UA , Sony traded the rights to Casino Royale for MGM 's partial @-@ rights to Spider @-@ Man . This led to Eon Productions making the 2006 film Casino Royale . The film stars Daniel Craig as Bond , supported by Eva Green as Vesper Lynd and Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre ; Judi Dench returned for her fifth Bond film as Bond 's superior , M. Casino Royale is a reboot , showing Bond at the beginning of his career as a 00 @-@ agent and overall stays true to the original novel . 
 A direct graphic novel adaptation of Casino Royale is planned for hardcover release on 22 November 2016 , to be published by Dynamite Entertainment as a standalone installment ( separate from their ongoing James Bond series ) , adapted by Van Jensen and illustrated by Matthew Southworth .

 = Suillus americanus = 
 Suillus americanus is a species of fungus in the Suillaceae family of mushrooms . Commonly known as the chicken fat mushroom , the American slippery Jack ( or slipperycap ) , or the American suillus , it grows in a mycorrhizal association with eastern white pine and can be found where this tree occurs in eastern North America and China . The mushroom can be recognized by the bright yellow cap with red to reddish @-@ brown scales embedded in slime , the large yellow angular pores on the underside of the cap , and the narrow yellow stem marked with dark reddish dots . Molecular phylogenetics analysis suggests that S. americanus may be the same species as S. sibiricus , found in western North America and western and central Asia . Suillus americanus is edible , although opinions vary as to its palatability ; some susceptible individuals may suffer a contact dermatitis after touching the fruit bodies . The fruit bodies contain a beta glucan carbohydrate shown in laboratory tests to have anti @-@ inflammatory properties . 
 = = Taxonomy and classification = = 
 Suillus americanus was first described scientifically by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1888 , based on specimens he had originally collected as far back as 1869 , in New York state , near Sand Lake , Albany , and Port Jefferson . In his 1888 publication he indicated that he had originally listed these collections as Boletus flavidus ( now known as Suillus flavidus ) in his 1869 Report of the State Botanist ( published in 1872 ) . However , as was pointed out nearly a century later in 1986 , the 1869 report does not actually mention the species ; rather , Peck 's field notes that year ( which served as the basis for the report ) reference a collection at Sand Lake upon which the original ( 1888 ) description was most likely based . Because Peck failed to designate a type specimen , one of the Sand Lake specimens was <unk> in 1986 . 
 In 1931 , French mycologist Édouard @-@ Jean Gilbert transferred the species to the genus Ixocomus , a now @-@ defunct taxon that has since been subsumed into Suillus . In 1959 , Walter H. Snell , collaborating with Rolf Singer and Esther A. Dick , transferred the species to Suillus . In his 1986 version of the authoritative monograph The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy , Singer included the species in the subsection Latiporini of genus Suillus , an infrageneric grouping ( below the taxonomic level of genus ) characterized by a cinnamon @-@ colored spore print without an olive tinge , and wide pores , typically greater than 1 mm when mature . 
 Common names for the species include the American slipperycap , the American suillus , or the chicken @-@ fat mushroom . The latter name is a reference to its yellow color . The specific epithet americanus means " of America " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is typically between 3 – 10 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter , broadly convex with a small umbo ( a central elevation ) to flat with age . The cap margin is curved inwards in young specimens , and may have remnants of a yellowish , cottony veil hanging from it . The cap surface is colored bright yellow with red or brownish streaks and hairy patches . When the fruit body is young and moist , the surface is slimy ; as the cap matures and dries out , it becomes sticky or tacky . 
 The tubes which comprise the pore layer on the underside of the cap are 0 @.@ 4 to 0 @.@ 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 16 to 0 @.@ 24 in ) deep , and have an adnate ( attached broadly to the stem ) to decurrent ( running down the length of the stem ) attachment to the stem . They are yellow , and stain reddish @-@ brown when bruised . The yellow pores are large ( 1 – 2 mm diameter ) and angular , and tend to become darker as they age . The pores are slightly wider than long , so that there are about 9 – 10 pores per centimeter measured radially , but 12 to 13 per centimeter when measured tangentially , about halfway to the edge . As is the case with all boletes , spores form on the inner surfaces of the tubes and sift through their openings to be borne away on the air currents outside . 
 The stem is 3 – 9 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 3 @.@ 5 in ) by 0 @.@ 4 – 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 4 in ) , roughly equal in width throughout , often crooked , and becomes hollow with age . The color of the stem surface is lemon yellow , and it is covered with glandular dots that bruise if handled . The partial veil is not attached to the stem , and usually does not leave an ring on the stem . A whitish mycelium present at the base of the stem helps anchor the fruit body in the substrate . The flesh is mustard yellow , and stains pinkish @-@ brown when cut or bruised .

 In deposit , the spores are cinnamon @-@ colored . Viewed with a microscope , they are pale yellow , smooth , and roughly elliptical in shape , and measure 8 – 9 @.@ 5 by 3 @.@ 5 – 5 µm . The basidia , the spore @-@ bearing cells , are club @-@ shaped and 4 @-@ spored , with dimensions of 21 – 25 by 5 @.@ 5 to 6 µm . The pleurocystidia ( cystidia found on the sides of a gill ) range in shape from cylindrical to club @-@ shaped and are arranged in bundles . Both the bases of the bundles and the surface of the cystidia may be covered with brown pigment particles . Cheilocystidia are cystidia located in the gill faces . In S. americanus , they are mostly club @-@ shaped , often with an expanded apex , and like the pleurocystidia , are arranged in bundles , with brown pigment particles at the base of the bundles . Bundles of cystidia near the tube openings may sometimes be visible with a hand lens . Like all Suillus species , the cystidia of S. americanus will turn orange @-@ brown in the presence of a solution of 3 % potassium hydroxide . The slimy layer on the cap surface results from an interwoven layer of gelatinous hyphae that are typically 3 – 5 µm thick . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 This species is edible , but opinions about its palatibility are mixed : one author says the fruit bodies are " coarse and do not taste good " ; another mentions the " thin flesh hardly make this species worthwhile ; " yet another says " The yellow cap may remind you of chicken fat ; it has a wonderfully savory mushroom flavor . " The slimy texture of the mushroom has been compared to okra . One cookbook author suggests that the mushroom is ideal for spreads , for use on bread or as a dip ; baking the fruit bodies in an oven will dry them for future use , and concentrate the flavor . The odor and taste are mild ; one field guide suggests it has a " distinctive lemony tang " . The slimy caps and the pore layer are typically removed before consumption . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Suillus americanus is very similar in appearance to Suillus sibiricus ( distributed in western North America and western and central Asia ) but the latter species associates with Pinus monticola and Pinus flexilis rather than Pinus strobus . One field guide suggests that Suillus sibiricus has a thicker stem than S. americanus , brown spots on the cap , and is a darker , more dingy yellow . Molecular phylogenetics analysis has shown , however , that specimens of S. <unk> collected from China and western North America , as well as S. americanus from eastern North America , are most likely " a single circumboreal taxon " . 
 Another lookalike species is Suillus <unk> , which can be distinguished microscopically by slightly smaller , hyaline ( translucent ) spores ( typically 7 @.@ 5 – 8 @.@ 5 by 3 µm ) , and an association with Quaking Aspen ( Populus tremuloides ) . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Suillus americanus is a common species , and is found growing solitarily or in clusters on the ground throughout northeastern North America , north to Canada , where it typically fruits in the late summer and autumn . It is also found in Guangdong , China , an example of a disjunct distribution . Fruit bodies can often be found in drier weather when other species are not abundant . 
 Suillus americanus is a mycorrhizal species , a mutualistic relationship where the fungus forms a sheath on the surface of the root from which hyphae extend outward into the soil , and inwards between the cortical cells with which they interface to form a Hartig net . The main benefit for the fungus is constant access to a supply of carbohydrates produced by the plant 's photosynthesis , while the plant benefits from an enhanced supply of mineral nutrients from the soil , taken up by the hyphae of the fungus . It grows in association with pines , particularly eastern white pine ( Pinus strobus ) .

 Some susceptible individuals have experienced an allergic reaction after touching Suillus americanus . The symptoms of allergic contact dermatitis generally develop one to two days after initial contact , persist for roughly a week , then disappear without treatment . Cooking the fruit bodies inactivates the responsible allergens .

 Suillus americanus contains a polysaccharide known as a beta glucan that laboratory tests suggest may have anti @-@ inflammatory activity . Known specifically as a ( 1 → 3 ) - , ( 1 → 4 ) -β @-@ D @-@ glucan , its natural function is as a component of the fungal cell wall , where it forms microcrystalline fibrils in the wall that give it rigidity and strength . The anti @-@ inflammatory activity results from the polysaccharide 's ability to inhibit the production of nitric oxide in activated macrophages , a cell of the immune system . 
 = Tropical Storm Dean ( 2001 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Dean was a strong tropical storm that affected at least twelve islands along its path from the tropical Atlantic Ocean to east of Atlantic Canada in August 2001 . Dean developed from a tropical wave on August 22 over the Lesser Antilles , and was initially predicted to intensify further to reach hurricane status . However , strong wind shear quickly weakened Dean to cause it to dissipate on August 23 . The remnants turned northward , and redeveloped on August 26 to the north of Bermuda . Located over warm waters and in an area of favorable conditions , Dean steadily strengthened while moving to the northeast , and peaked just below hurricane status on August 27 about 465 miles ( 750 km ) southwest of Newfoundland . The storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters , and became extratropical on August 28 . 
 The precursor tropical wave dropped heavy rainfall and produced moderate winds throughout the Lesser Antilles , though no serious damage was reported . In Puerto Rico , rainfall of up to 12 @.@ 7 inches ( 322 mm ) produced widespread flooding across the island . Thousands were left without power or water , and two houses lost their roofs from the storm . The passage of Dean resulted in $ 7 @.@ 7 million ( 2001 USD , $ 9 @.@ 4 million 2008 USD ) in damage in Puerto Rico . The storm produced light to moderate rainfall in Bermuda and later in Newfoundland , though no damage was reported . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A large tropical wave with minimal convection moved off the coast of Africa near Dakar between August 14 and August 15 . It moved westward , and gradually developed thunderstorms across the wave axis . On August 21 , while located about 450 miles ( 725 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles , convection increased further within the system , though unfavorable upper @-@ level wind shear prevented rapid development . It continued to become better organized , and though a Reconnaissance flight into the system reported strong winds , it lacked a surface circulation . Late on August 21 the wave passed through the northern Lesser Antilles , and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear the system became much better organized on August 22 . A surface circulation formed , and the system developed into Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 near Saint Croix . Dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to the presence of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) winds in the storm . 
 Reconnaissance Aircraft and surface reports confirmed the existence of a circulation . Dean moved northwestward at 22 mph ( 35 km / h ) , under the influence of the Bermuda High to its northeast . The storm strengthened slightly to reach winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) later on August 22 , though the circulation was exposed on the western edge of the convection due to the storm 's quick forward motion and persistent wind shear . Initial forecasts predicted the shear to decrease , allowing Dean to attain hurricane status with winds of over 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . However , an upper @-@ level trough produced an increase of shear over the storm , and by August 23 Dean weakened to a tropical depression . Hours later , the circulation dissipated , and Dean degenerated into a tropical wave to the east of the Bahamas . Regeneration was considered unlikely at the time . 
 The remnants of Dean turned to the north , and became embedded within a large mid @-@ level trough off the East Coast of the United States . Convection increased around the system early on August 24 . The system became better organized , with indications of a broad surface circulation forming about 400 miles ( 645 km ) west @-@ southwest of Bermuda . However , a reconnaissance flight into the remnants of Dean reported a broad low pressure area with the strongest winds and convection located far from the area of minimum pressure , indicating it had some non @-@ tropical characteristics . The weak disturbance passed to the west of Bermuda early on August 25 , and subsequently began to drift to the northeast . The remnants of Dean produced convection near its developing circulation , and on August 26 , while located 220 miles ( 350 km ) north of Bermuda the system organized sufficiently enough to be re @-@ classified a tropical depression . Operationally , the National Hurricane Center did not re @-@ initiate advisories until fifteen hours later . 
 The depression continued to the northeast , and re @-@ strengthened into Tropical Storm Dean early on August 27 while located 580 miles ( 930 km ) south of Halifax , Nova Scotia . The convection became better organized , and Dean steadily strengthened as it tracked northeastward . A ship near the center of Dean confirmed the storm re @-@ developed . The convection near the center greatly organized , and an eye feature began to develop . Remaining over warm waters , Dean continued to strengthen and reached peak winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) late on August 27 while located about 465 miles ( 750 km ) southwest of Cape Race , Newfoundland . The eye feature failed to develop further , and after maintaining its peak intensity for 12 hours Dean weakened over progressively cooler waters . The convection quickly diminished , and on August 28 Dean became extratropical while located 145 miles ( 235 km ) east @-@ southeast of Cape Race , Newfoundland . The extratropical storm continued northeastward until being absorbed by a frontal low on August 29 .

 About a day before Dean developed , the National Hurricane Center advised interests in the northern and central Lesser Antilles to monitor the progress of the storm . Routine statements issued by the National Hurricane Center warned for the possibility of strong winds and heavy rains . However , because Dean formed after it passed the islands , no tropical cyclone warnings or watches were issued . The precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall on Saint Martin of around 5 inches ( 129 mm ) . 
 The precursor disturbance to Tropical Storm Dean produced 1 @.@ 07 inches ( 27 mm ) of rain in Saint Thomas , where winds reached 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) with gusts to 48 mph ( 77 km / h ) . On Saint Croix , the system produced 0 @.@ 49 inches ( 12 mm ) of rain and peak wind gusts of 47 mph ( 76 km / h ) . There , minor flooding was reported . Moderate wind gusts downed small trees and branches in Saint Croix and Saint John , and some roads were damaged in Saint John , as well . Heavy rains and gusty winds caused power outages throughout the U.S. Virgin Islands . The passage of Tropical Storm Dean resulted in minor damage totaling to $ 20 @,@ 000 ( 2001 USD , $ 24 @,@ 400 2008 USD ) . 
 Tropical Storm Dean dropped heavy rainfall across Puerto Rico , peaking at 12 @.@ 7 inches ( 322 mm ) in Salinas . Winds were generally light across the island . The passage of Dean resulted in widespread flooding in eastern and southern Puerto Rico , collapsing two bridges and one road . Several highways were under water , and one car was swept away by the floodwaters . The four inside the vehicle were later rescued and unharmed . Throughout the island , about 1 @,@ 320 houses were flooded , and two houses experienced collapsed roofs . The rains left various towns without power or water . By the night after the storm passed the island , more than 16 @,@ 000 were without power , while almost 70 @,@ 000 lacked potable water . Over 130 people were evacuated from low @-@ lying areas to hurricane shelters . Two people were injured in Peñuelas , and three were injured in <unk> when the ceiling of a day care center collapsed , though no deaths occurred on the island . One airline canceled seventeen flights in and out of the island , and one cruise line was required to alter its path to both Dean and earlier due to Tropical Storm Chantal . Damage in Puerto Rico totaled to $ 7 @.@ 7 million ( 2001 USD , $ 9 @.@ 4 million 2008 USD ) , of which $ 2 @.@ 1 million ( 2001 USD , $ 2 @.@ 6 million 2008 USD ) was from agricultural damage .

 Shortly after Dean formed , the government of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands . When the storm weakened and ultimately dissipated , the warnings were canceled . The remnants of Dean produced unsettled conditions across Bermuda , including a wind gust of 41 mph ( 66 km / h ) and light rainfall of 0 @.@ 31 inches ( 8 mm ) . The passage of Dean resulted in the coldest day of August 2001 on the island . Dean produced wind gusts peaking at 63 mph ( 103 km / h ) in Newfoundland , along with rainfall up to 4 @.@ 2 inches ( 107 mm ) in eastern Newfoundland .

 = John Wilkes Booth = 
 John Wilkes Booth ( May 10 , 1838 – April 26 , 1865 ) was an American stage actor who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln at Ford 's Theatre , in Washington , D.C. , on April 14 , 1865 . Booth was a member of the prominent 19th @-@ century Booth theatrical family from Maryland and , by the 1860s , was a well @-@ known actor . He was also a Confederate sympathizer , vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln , and was strongly opposed to the abolition of slavery in the United States . 
 Booth and a group of co @-@ conspirators originally plotted to kidnap Lincoln but later planned to kill him , Vice President Andrew Johnson , and Secretary of State William H. Seward in a bid to help the Confederacy 's cause . Although Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia had surrendered four days earlier , Booth believed the American Civil War was not yet over because Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston 's army was still fighting the Union Army . 
 Of the conspirators , only Booth was completely successful in carrying out his part of the plot : Booth shot Lincoln once in the back of the head , and the President died the next morning . Seward was severely wounded but recovered . Vice @-@ President Johnson was never attacked at all . 
 Following the assassination , Booth fled on horseback to southern Maryland , eventually making his way to a farm in rural northern Virginia 12 days later , where he was tracked down . Booth 's companion gave himself up , but Booth refused and was shot by Boston Corbett , a Union soldier , after the barn in which he was hiding was set ablaze . Eight other conspirators or suspects were tried and convicted , and four were hanged shortly thereafter . 
 = = Background and early life = = 
 Booth 's parents , the noted British Shakespearean actor Junius Brutus Booth and his mistress Mary Ann Holmes , moved to the United States from England in June 1821 . They purchased a 150 @-@ acre ( 61 ha ) farm near Bel Air in Harford County , Maryland , where John Wilkes Booth was born in a four @-@ room log house on May 10 , 1838 , the ninth of ten children . He was named after the English radical politician John Wilkes , a distant relative . Junius ' wife , Adelaide <unk> Booth , was granted a divorce in 1851 on grounds of adultery , and Holmes legally wed Julius on May 10 , 1851 , the youth 's 13th birthday . 
 Nora <unk> , in her book My Thoughts Be Bloody ( 2010 ) , recounts how the shame and ambition of Junius Brutus Booth 's two illegitimate actor sons , Edwin and John Wilkes , would eventually spur them to strive , as rivals , for achievement and acclaim — Edwin , a Unionist , and John Wilkes , the assassin of Abraham Lincoln . 
 The same year Booth 's father married Holmes ( 1851 ) , he built Tudor Hall on the Harford County property as the family 's summer home , while also maintaining a winter residence on Exeter Street in Baltimore , in the 1840s – 1850s . 
 As a boy , Booth was athletic and popular , and he became skilled at horsemanship and fencing . A sometimes indifferent student , he attended the Bel Air Academy ( now Bel Air High School ) , where the headmaster described him as " [ n ] ot deficient in intelligence , but disinclined to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered him . Each day he rode back and forth from farm to school , taking more interest in what happened along the way than in reaching his classes on time " . In 1850 – 1851 , he attended the Quaker @-@ run Milton Boarding School for Boys located in Sparks , Maryland and later St. Timothy 's Hall , an Episcopal military academy in Catonsville , Maryland , beginning when he was 13 years old . At the Milton school , students recited classical works by such authors as Cicero , Herodotus , and Tacitus . Students at St. Timothy 's wore military uniforms , and were subject to a regimen of daily formation drills and strict discipline . Booth left school at 14 , after his father 's death . 
 While attending the Milton Boarding School , Booth met a Gypsy fortune @-@ teller who read his palm and pronounced a grim destiny , telling Booth he would have a grand but short life , doomed to die young and " meeting a bad end " . His sister recalled that Booth wrote down the palm @-@ reader 's prediction , showed it to his family and others , and often discussed its portents in moments of melancholy , in later years . 
 As recounted in the editor 's introduction of the 1874 memoir of Booth 's sister 's , Asia Booth Clarke , no one church was preeminent in the Booth household during her childhood . Booth 's mother was Episcopalian , and his father was described as a free spirit , who was open to the great teachings of all religions . On January 23 , 1853 , the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Booth was baptized at St. Timothy 's Protestant Episcopal Church . The Booth family had traditionally been Episcopalian . Clergyman Charles <unk> , however , stated that Booth was really a Roman Catholic convert , later in life . An historian , Constance Head , also declared that Booth was of this religion . Head , who wrote the paper " Insights on John Wilkes Booth from His Sister Asia 's Correspondence " ( 1982 ) , published in the Lincoln Herald , quoted from a letter of Booth 's sister , Asia Booth Clarke , in which she wrote that her brother was a Roman Catholic . Booth Clarke 's memoir was published after her death . Terry Alford , a college history professor and a leading authority on Booth 's life , has stated , " Asia Booth Clarke 's memoir of her brother John Wilkes Booth has been recognized as the single most important document available for understanding the personality of the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln " , and " no outsider could give such insights into the turbulent Booth 's childhood or share such unique personal knowledge of the gifted actor " . Testimony given at the trial of John Surratt showed that at his death , Booth had a Catholic medal on his person . Court evidence showed his attending a Roman Catholic church service on at least two occasions . Like his sister Asia , he received education at a school established by an official of the Catholic Church . As to Lincoln 's assassin 's being seen an Episcopalian during his life and in death , while really being a Roman Catholic , Constance Head stated : " In any case , it seems certain that Booth did not publicize his conversion during his lifetime . And while there is no reasonable cause to connect Booth 's religious preference and his ' mad act ' , the few who knew of his conversion must have decided after the assassination that for the good of the church , it was best never to mention it . Thus the secret remained so well guarded that even the most <unk> anti @-@ Catholic writers who tried to depict the assassination of Lincoln as a Jesuit or Papist plot were puzzled by the seemingly accurate information that John Wilkes Booth was an Episcopalian . " 
 By the age of 16 , Booth was interested in the theatre and in politics , and he became a delegate from Bel Air to a rally by the Know Nothing Party for Henry Winter Davis , the anti @-@ immigrant party 's candidate for Congress in the 1854 elections . Aspiring to follow in the footsteps of his father and his actor brothers , Edwin and Junius Brutus , Jr . , Booth began practicing elocution daily in the woods around Tudor Hall and studying Shakespeare .

 At age 17 , Booth made his stage debut on August 14 , 1855 , in the supporting role of the Earl of Richmond in Richard III at Baltimore 's Charles Street Theatre . The audience hissed at the inexperienced actor when he missed some of his lines . He also began acting at Baltimore 's Holliday Street Theater , owned by John T. Ford , where the Booths had performed frequently . In 1857 , Booth joined the stock company of the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , where he played for a full season . At his request he was billed as " J.B. Wilkes " , a pseudonym meant to avoid comparison with other members of his famous thespian family . Author Jim Bishop wrote that Booth " developed into an outrageous scene stealer , but he played his parts with such heightened enthusiasm that the audiences idolized him . " In February 1858 , he played in Lucrezia Borgia at the Arch Street Theatre . On opening night , he experienced stage fright and stumbled over his line . Instead of introducing himself by saying , " Madame , I am Petruchio Pandolfo " , he stammered , " Madame , I am <unk> Pet — <unk> Pat — <unk> <unk> — dammit ! Who am I ? " , causing the audience to roar with laughter . 
 Later that year , Booth played the part of an American Indian , Uncas , in a play staged in Petersburg , Virginia , and then became a stock company actor at the Richmond Theatre in Virginia , where he became increasingly popular with audiences for his energetic performances . On October 5 , 1858 , Booth played the part of Horatio in Hamlet , alongside his older brother Edwin in the title role . Afterward , Edwin led the younger Booth to the theatre 's footlights and said to the audience , " I think he 's done well , don 't you ? " In response , the audience applauded loudly and cried , " Yes ! Yes ! " In all , Booth performed in 83 plays in 1858 . Among them were William Wallace and Brutus , having as their theme the killing or overthrow of an unjust ruler . Booth said that of all Shakespearean characters , his favorite role was Brutus – the slayer of a tyrant . 
 Some critics called Booth " the handsomest man in America " and a " natural genius " , and noted his having an " astonishing memory " ; others were mixed in their estimation of his acting . He stood 5 feet 8 inches ( 1 @.@ 73 m ) tall , had jet @-@ black hair , and was lean and athletic . Noted Civil War reporter George Alfred Townsend described him as a " muscular , perfect man " , with " curling hair , like a Corinthian capital " . 
 Booth 's stage performances were often characterized by his contemporaries as acrobatic and intensely physical , with him leaping upon the stage and gesturing with passion . He was an excellent swordsman , although a fellow actor once recalled that Booth occasionally cut himself with his own sword . 
 Historian Benjamin Platt Thomas wrote that Booth " won celebrity with theater @-@ goers by his romantic personal attraction " , but that he was " too impatient for hard study " , and his " brilliant talents had failed of full development . Author Gene Smith wrote that Booth 's acting may not have been as precise as his brother Edwin 's , but his strikingly handsome appearance enthralled women . As the 1850s drew to a close , Booth was becoming wealthy as an actor , earning $ 20 @,@ 000 a year ( equivalent to about $ 527 @,@ 000 today ) . 
 = = = 1860s = = = 
 After finishing the 1859 – 1860 theatre season in Richmond , Virginia , Booth embarked on his first national tour as a leading actor . He engaged a Philadelphia attorney , Matthew Canning , to serve as his agent . By mid @-@ 1860 , he was playing in such cities as New York ; Boston ; Chicago ; Cleveland ; St. Louis ; Columbus , Georgia ; Montgomery , Alabama ; and New Orleans . Poet and journalist Walt Whitman said of Booth 's acting , " He would have flashes , passages , I thought of real genius . " The Philadelphia Press drama critic said , " Without having [ his brother ] Edwin 's culture and grace , Mr. Booth has far more action , more life , and , we are inclined to think , more natural genius . " 
 When the Civil War began on April 12 , 1861 , Booth was starring in Albany , New York . His outspoken admiration for the South 's secession , publicly calling it " heroic " , so enraged local citizens that they demanded his banning from the stage for making " treasonable statements " . Albany 's drama critics were kinder , however , giving him rave reviews . One called him a genius , praising his acting for " never fail [ ing ] to delight with his masterly impressions . " As the Civil War raged across the divided land in 1862 , Booth appeared mostly in Union and border states . In January , he played the title role in Richard III in St. Louis and then made his Chicago debut . In March , he made his first acting appearance in New York City . In May 1862 , he made his Boston debut , playing nightly at the Boston Museum in Richard III ( May 12 , 15 , and 23 ) , Romeo and Juliet ( May 13 ) , The Robbers ( May 14 and 21 ) , Hamlet ( May 16 ) , The Apostate ( May 19 ) , The Stranger ( May 20 ) , and The Lady of Lyons ( May 22 ) . Following his performance of Richard III on May 12 , the Boston Transcript 's review the next day called Booth " the most promising young actor on the American stage " . 
 Starting in January 1863 , he returned to the Boston Museum for a series of plays , including the role of the villain Duke Pescara in The Apostate that won acclaim from audiences and critics . Back in Washington in April , he played the title roles in Hamlet and Richard III , one of his favorites . He was billed as " The Pride of the American People , A Star of the First Magnitude , " and the critics were equally enthusiastic . The National Republican drama critic said Booth " took the hearts of the audience by storm " and termed his performance " a complete triumph " . At the beginning of July 1863 , Booth finished the acting season at Cleveland 's Academy of Music , as the Battle of Gettysburg raged in Pennsylvania . Between September – November 1863 , Booth played a hectic schedule in the northeast , appearing in Boston , Providence , Rhode Island , and Hartford , Connecticut . Each day he received fan mail from infatuated women . 
 When family friend John T. Ford opened 1 @,@ 500 @-@ seat Ford 's Theatre on November 9 in Washington , D.C. , Booth was one of the first leading men to appear there , playing in Charles Selby 's The Marble Heart . In this play , Booth portrayed a Greek sculptor in costume , making marble statues come to life . Lincoln watched the play from his box . At one point during the performance , Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln 's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue . Lincoln 's sister @-@ in @-@ law , sitting with him in the same presidential box where he would later be slain , turned to him and said , " Mr. Lincoln , he looks as if he meant that for you . " The President replied , " He does look pretty sharp at me , doesn 't he ? " On another occasion when Lincoln 's son Tad saw Booth perform , he said the actor thrilled him , prompting Booth to give the President 's youngest son a rose . Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts , however . 
 On November 25 , 1864 , Booth performed for the only time with his two brothers , Edwin and Junius , in a single engagement production of Julius Caesar at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York . He played Mark Antony and his brother Edwin had the larger role of Brutus in a performance acclaimed as " the greatest theatrical event in New York history . " The proceeds went towards a statue of William Shakespeare for Central Park , which still stands today . In January 1865 , he acted in Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet in Washington , again garnering rave reviews . The National Intelligencer enthused of Booth 's Romeo , " the most satisfactory of all renderings of that fine character , " especially praising the death scene . Booth made the final appearance of his acting career at Ford 's on March 18 , 1865 , when he again played Duke Pescara in The Apostate . 
 = = Business ventures = = 
 Booth invested some of his growing wealth in various enterprises during the early 1860s , including land speculation in Boston 's Back Bay section . He also started a business partnership with John A. <unk> , manager of the Cleveland Academy of Music , and another friend , Thomas Mears , to develop oil wells in northwestern Pennsylvania , where an oil boom had started in August 1859 , following Edwin Drake 's discovery of oil there . Initially calling their venture Dramatic Oil ( later renaming it Fuller Farm Oil ) , the partners invested in a 31 @.@ 5 @-@ acre ( 12 @.@ 7 ha ) site along the Allegheny River at Franklin , Pennsylvania , in late 1863 for drilling . By early 1864 , they had a producing 1 @,@ 900 @-@ foot ( 579 m ) deep oil well , named Wilhelmina for Mears ' wife , yielding 25 barrels ( 4 kL ) of crude oil daily , then considered a good yield . The Fuller Farm Oil company was selling shares with a prospectus featuring the well @-@ known actor 's celebrity status as " Mr. J. Wilkes Booth , a successful and intelligent operator in oil lands " , it said . The partners , impatient to increase the well 's output , attempted the use of explosives , which wrecked the well and ended production . Booth , already growing more obsessed with the South 's worsening situation in the Civil War and angered at Lincoln 's re @-@ election , withdrew from the oil business on November 27 , 1864 , with a substantial loss of his $ 6 @,@ 000 ( $ 81 @,@ 400 in 2010 dollars ) investment . 
 = = Civil War years = = 
 Strongly opposed to the abolitionists who sought to end slavery in the U.S. , Booth attended the hanging on December 2 , 1859 , of abolitionist leader John Brown , who was executed for leading a raid on the Federal armory at Harpers Ferry ( in present @-@ day West Virginia ) . Booth had been rehearsing at the Richmond Theatre when he abruptly decided to join the Richmond Grays , a volunteer militia of 1 @,@ 500 men travelling to Charles Town for Brown 's hanging , to guard against an attempt by abolitionists to rescue Brown from the gallows by force . When Brown was hanged without incident , Booth stood in uniform near the scaffold and afterwards expressed great satisfaction with Brown 's fate , although he admired the condemned man 's bravery in facing death stoically . 
 Lincoln was elected president on November 6 , 1860 , and the following month Booth drafted a long speech , apparently undelivered , that decried Northern abolitionism and made clear his strong support of the South and the institution of slavery . On April 12 , 1861 , the Civil War began , and eventually 11 Southern states seceded from the Union . In Booth 's native Maryland , the slaveholding portion of the population favored joining the Confederate States of America . Because the threatened secession of Maryland would leave the Federal capital of Washington , D.C. , an indefensible enclave within the Confederacy , Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus and imposed martial law in Baltimore and portions of the state , ordering the imprisonment of pro @-@ secession Maryland political leaders at Ft . McHenry and the stationing of Federal troops in Baltimore . Although Maryland remained in the Union , newspaper editorials and many Marylanders , including Booth , agreed with Judge Roger B. Taney 's decision in Ex parte Merryman that Lincoln 's actions were unconstitutional . 
 As a popular actor in the 1860s , he continued to travel extensively to perform in the North and South , and as far west as New Orleans , Louisiana . According to his sister Asia , Booth confided to her that he also used his position to smuggle quinine to the South during his travels there , helping the Confederacy obtain the needed drug despite the Northern blockade . 
 Although Booth was pro @-@ Confederate , his family , like many Marylanders , was divided . He was outspoken in his love of the South , and equally outspoken in his hatred of Lincoln . As the Civil War went on , Booth increasingly quarreled with his brother Edwin , who declined to make stage appearances in the South and refused to listen to John Wilkes ' fiercely partisan denunciations of the North and Lincoln . In early 1863 , Booth was arrested in St. Louis while on a theatre tour , when he was heard saying he " wished the President and the whole damned government would go to hell . " Charged with making " treasonous " remarks against the government , he was released when he took an oath of allegiance to the Union and paid a substantial fine . 
 In February 1865 , Booth became infatuated with Lucy Lambert Hale , the daughter of U.S. Senator John P. Hale of New Hampshire , and they became secretly engaged when Booth received his mother 's blessing for their marriage plans . " You have so often been dead in love , " his mother counseled Booth in a letter , " be well assured she is really and truly devoted to you . " Booth composed a handwritten Valentine card for his fiancée on February 13 , expressing his " adoration " . She was unaware of Booth 's deep antipathy towards President Lincoln . 
 = = = Plot to kidnap Lincoln = = = 
 As the 1864 Presidential election drew near , the Confederacy 's prospects for victory were ebbing , and the tide of war increasingly favored the North . The likelihood of Lincoln 's re @-@ election filled Booth with rage towards the President , whom Booth blamed for the war and all of the South 's troubles . Booth , who had promised his mother at the outbreak of war that he would not enlist as a soldier , increasingly chafed at not fighting for the South , writing in a letter to her , " I have begun to deem myself a coward and to despise my own existence . " He began to formulate plans to kidnap Lincoln from his summer residence at the Old Soldiers Home , three miles ( 5 km ) from the White House , and to smuggle him across the Potomac River into Richmond . Once in Confederate hands , Lincoln would be exchanged for the release of Confederate Army prisoners of war held captive in Northern prisons and , Booth reasoned , bring the war to an end by emboldening opposition to the war in the North or forcing Union recognition of the Confederate government . 
 Throughout the Civil War , the Confederacy maintained a network of underground operators in southern Maryland , particularly Charles and St. Mary 's counties , smuggling recruits across the Potomac River into Virginia and relaying messages for Confederate agents as far north as Canada . Booth recruited his friends Samuel Arnold and Michael O 'Laughlen as accomplices . They met often at the house of Maggie Branson , a known Confederate sympathizer , at 16 North Eutaw Street in Baltimore . He also met with several well @-@ known Confederate sympathizers at The Parker House in Boston . 
 In October , Booth made an unexplained trip to Montreal , which was then a well @-@ known center of clandestine Confederate activity . He spent ten days in the city , staying for a time at St. Lawrence Hall , a rendezvous for the Confederate Secret Service , and meeting several Confederate agents there . No conclusive proof has linked Booth 's kidnapping or assassination plots to a conspiracy involving the leadership of the Confederate government , although historians such as David Herbert Donald have said , " It is clear that , at least at the lower levels of the Southern secret service , the abduction of the Union President was under consideration . " Historian Thomas Goodrich concluded that Booth entered the Confederate Secret Service as a spy and courier . Other writers exploring possible connections between Booth 's planning and Confederate agents include Nathan Miller 's Spying For America and William Tidwell 's Come Retribution : the Confederate Secret Service and the Assassination of Lincoln . 
 After Lincoln 's landslide re @-@ election in early November 1864 on a platform advocating passage of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to abolish slavery altogether , Booth devoted increasing energy and money to his kidnap plot . He assembled a loose @-@ knit band of Southern sympathizers , including David Herold , George Atzerodt , Lewis Powell ( also known as Lewis Payne or Paine ) , and John Surratt , a rebel agent . They began to meet routinely at the boarding house of Surratt 's mother , Mrs. Mary Surratt . 
 By this time , Booth was arguing so vehemently with his older , pro @-@ Union brother Edwin about Lincoln and the war that Edwin finally told him he was no longer welcome at his New York home . Booth also railed against Lincoln in conversations with his sister Asia , saying , " That man 's appearance , his pedigree , his coarse low jokes and anecdotes , his vulgar similes , and his policy are a disgrace to the seat he holds . He is made the tool of the North , to crush out slavery . " As the Confederacy 's defeat became more certain in 1865 , Booth decried the end of slavery and Lincoln 's election to a second term , " making himself a king " , the actor fumed , in " wild tirades " , his sister recalled . 
 Booth attended Lincoln 's second inauguration on March 4 as the invited guest of his secret fiancée , Lucy Hale . In the crowd below were Powell , Atzerodt , and Herold . There was no attempt to assassinate Lincoln during the inauguration . Later , however , Booth remarked about his " excellent chance ... to kill the President , if I had wished . " 
 On March 17 , Booth learned that Lincoln would be attending a performance of the play Still Waters Run Deep at a hospital near the Soldier 's Home . Booth assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier 's Home in the attempt to kidnap Lincoln en route to the hospital , but the president did not appear . Booth later learned that Lincoln had changed his plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington where , coincidentally , Booth was then staying . 
 = = Assassination of Lincoln = = 
 On April 12 , 1865 , after hearing the news that Robert E. Lee had surrendered at Appomattox Court House , Booth told Louis J. <unk> , a friend of John Surratt , and a boarder at Mary Surratt 's house , that he was done with the stage and that the only play he wanted to present henceforth was Venice Preserv 'd . <unk> did not understand the reference : Venice Preserv 'd is about an assassination plot . With the Union Army 's capture of Richmond and Lee 's surrender , Booth 's scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible , and he changed his goal to assassination . 
 The previous day , Booth was in the crowd outside the White House when Lincoln gave an impromptu speech from his window . When Lincoln stated that he was in favor of granting suffrage to the former slaves , Booth declared that it would be the last speech Lincoln would ever make . 
 On the morning of Good Friday , April 14 , 1865 , Booth went to Ford 's Theatre to get his mail ; while there he was told by John Ford 's brother that President and Mrs. Lincoln accompanied by Gen. and Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant would be attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford 's Theatre that evening . He immediately set about making plans for the assassination , which included making arrangements with livery stable owner James W. Pumphrey for a getaway horse , and an escape route . Booth informed Powell , Herold , and Atzerodt of his intention to kill Lincoln . He assigned Powell to assassinate Secretary of State William H. Seward and Atzerodt to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson . Herold would assist in their escape into Virginia . 
 By targeting Lincoln and his two immediate successors to the presidency , Booth seems to have intended to decapitate the Union government and throw it into a state of panic and confusion . The possibility of assassinating the Union Army 's commanding general as well was foiled when Grant declined the theatre invitation at his wife 's insistence . Instead , the Grants departed Washington by train that evening for a visit to relatives in New Jersey . Booth had hoped that the assassinations would create sufficient chaos within the Union that the Confederate government could reorganize and continue the war if one Confederate army remained in the field or , that failing , to avenge the South 's defeat . In his 2005 analysis of Lincoln 's assassination , Thomas Goodrich wrote , " All the elements in Booth 's nature came together at once – his hatred of tyranny , his love of liberty , his passion for the stage , his sense of drama , and his lifelong quest to become immortal . " 
 As a famous and popular actor who had frequently performed at Ford 's Theatre , and who was well known to its owner , John T. Ford , Booth had free access to all parts of the theater , even having his mail sent there . By boring a <unk> into the door of the presidential box earlier that day , the assassin could check that his intended victim had made it to the play and observe the box 's occupants . That evening , at around 10 p.m. , as the play progressed , John Wilkes Booth slipped into Lincoln 's box and shot him in the back of the head with a .41 caliber Deringer . Booth 's escape was almost thwarted by Major Henry Rathbone , who was present in the Presidential box with Mrs. Mary Todd Lincoln . Booth stabbed Rathbone when the startled officer lunged at him . Rathbone 's fiancée , Clara Harris , who was also present in the box , was unhurt . 
 Booth then jumped from the President 's box to the stage , where he raised his knife and shouted " Sic semper <unk> " ( Latin for " Thus always to tyrants , " attributed to Brutus at Caesar 's assassination and the Virginia state motto ) , while others said he added , " I have done it , the South is avenged ! " Various accounts state that Booth injured his leg when his spur snagged a decorative U.S. Treasury Guard flag while leaping to the stage . Historian Michael W. Kauffman questioned this legend in his book , American Brutus : John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies , writing in 2004 that eyewitness accounts of Booth 's hurried stage exit made it unlikely that his leg was broken then . Kauffman contends that Booth was injured later that night during his flight to escape when his horse tripped and fell on him , calling Booth 's claim to the contrary an exaggeration to portray his own actions as heroic . 
 Booth was the only one of the assassins to succeed . Powell was able to stab Seward , who was bedridden as a result of an earlier carriage accident ; although badly wounded , Seward survived . Atzerodt lost his nerve and spent the evening drinking alcohol ; he never made an attempt to kill Johnson .

 In the ensuing pandemonium inside Ford 's Theatre , Booth fled by a stage door to the alley , where his getaway horse was held for him by Joseph " Peanuts " Burroughs . The owner of the horse had warned Booth that the horse was high spirited and would break halter if left unattended . Booth left the horse with Edmund Spangler and Spangler arranged for Burroughs to hold the horse . 
 The fleeing assassin galloped into southern Maryland , accompanied by David Herold , having planned his escape route to take advantage of the sparsely settled area 's lack of telegraphs and railroads , along with its predominantly Confederate sympathies . He thought that the area 's dense forests and swampy terrain of Zekiah Swamp made it ideal for an escape route into rural Virginia . At midnight , Booth and Herold arrived at Surratt 's Tavern on the Brandywine Pike , 9 miles ( 14 km ) from Washington , where they had stored guns and equipment earlier in the year as part of the kidnap plot . 
 The fugitives then continued southward , stopping before dawn on April 15 at the home of Dr. Samuel Mudd , St. Catharine , 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Washington , for treatment of Booth 's injured leg . Mudd later said that Booth told him the injury occurred when his horse fell . The next day , Booth and Herold arrived at the home of Samuel Cox around 4 a.m. As the two fugitives hid in the woods nearby , Cox contacted Thomas A. Jones , his foster brother and a Confederate agent in charge of spy operations in the southern Maryland area since 1862 . By order of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton , the War Department advertised a $ 100 @,@ 000 reward ( $ 1 @.@ 55 million in 2016 USD ) for information leading to the arrest of Booth and his accomplices , and Federal troops were dispatched to search southern Maryland extensively , following tips reported by Federal intelligence agents to Col. Lafayette Baker . 
 While Federal troops combed the rural area 's woods and swamps for Booth in the days following the assassination , the nation experienced an outpouring of grief . On April 18 , mourners waited seven abreast in a mile @-@ long line outside the White House for the public viewing of the slain president , reposing in his open walnut casket in the black @-@ draped East Room . A cross of lilies was at the head and roses covered the coffin 's lower half . Thousands of mourners arriving on special trains jammed Washington for the next day 's funeral , sleeping on hotel floors and even resorting to blankets spread outdoors on the Capitol 's lawn . Prominent abolitionist leader and orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an " unspeakable calamity " for African Americans . Great indignation was directed towards Booth as the assassin 's identity was telegraphed across the nation . Newspapers called him an " accursed devil , " " monster , " " madman , " and a " wretched fiend . " Historian Dorothy Kunhardt wrote : " Almost every family who kept a photograph album on the parlor table owned a likeness of John Wilkes Booth of the famous Booth family of actors . After the assassination Northerners slid the Booth card out of their albums : some threw it away , some burned it , some crumpled it angrily . " Even in the South , sorrow was expressed in some quarters . In Savannah , Georgia , where the mayor and city council addressed a vast throng at an outdoor gathering to express their indignation , many in the crowd wept . Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston called Booth 's act " a disgrace to the age " . Robert E. Lee also expressed regret at Lincoln 's death by Booth 's hand . 
 Not all were grief @-@ stricken , however . In New York City , a man was attacked by an enraged crowd when he shouted , " It served Old Abe right ! " after hearing the news of Lincoln 's death . Elsewhere in the South , Lincoln was hated in death as in life , and Booth was viewed as a hero as many rejoiced at news of his deed . Other Southerners feared that a vengeful North would exact a terrible retribution upon the defeated former Confederate states . " Instead of being a great Southern hero , his deed was considered the worst possible tragedy that could have befallen the South as well as the North , " wrote Kunhardt . 
 While hiding in the Maryland woods as he waited for an opportunity to cross the Potomac River into Virginia , Booth read the accounts of national mourning reported in the newspapers brought to him by Jones each day . By April 20 , he was aware that some of his co @-@ conspirators were already arrested : Mary Surratt , Powell ( or Paine ) , Arnold , and O 'Laughlen . Booth was surprised to find little public sympathy for his action , especially from those anti @-@ Lincoln newspapers that had previously excoriated the President in life . As news of the assassination reached the far corners of the nation , indignation was aroused against Lincoln 's critics , whom many blamed for encouraging Booth to act . The San Francisco Chronicle editorialized : " Booth has simply carried out what ... secession politicians and journalists have been for years expressing in words ... who have denounced the President as a ' tyrant , ' a ' despot , ' a ' usurper , ' hinted at , and virtually recommended . " Booth wrote of his dismay in a journal entry on April 21 , as he awaited nightfall before crossing the Potomac River into Virginia ( see map ) : 
 " For six months we had worked to capture . But our cause being almost lost , something decisive and great must be done . I struck boldly , and not as the papers say . I can never repent it , though we hated to kill . " 
 That same day , the nine @-@ car funeral train bearing Lincoln 's body departed Washington on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad , arriving at Baltimore 's Camden Station at 10 a.m. , the first stop on a 13 @-@ day journey to Springfield , Illinois , its final destination . As the funeral train slowly made its way westward through seven states , stopping en route at Harrisburg ; Philadelphia ; Trenton ; New York ; Albany ; Buffalo ; Cleveland ; Columbus , Ohio ; Cincinnati ; and Indianapolis during the following days , about 7 million people lined the railroad tracks along the 1 @,@ 662 @-@ mile ( 2 @,@ 675 km ) route , holding aloft signs with legends such as " We mourn our loss , " " He lives in the hearts of his people , " and " The darkest hour in history . " 
 In the cities where the train stopped , 1 @.@ 5 million people viewed Lincoln in his coffin . Aboard the train was Clarence Depew , president of the New York Central Railroad , who said , " As we sped over the rails at night , the scene was the most pathetic ever witnessed . At every crossroads the glare of innumerable torches illuminated the whole population , kneeling on the ground . " Dorothy Kunhardt called the funeral train 's journey " the mightiest outpouring of national grief the world had yet seen . " 
 Meanwhile , as mourners were viewing Lincoln 's remains when the funeral train steamed into Harrisburg at 8 : 20 p.m. , Booth and Herold were provided with a boat and compass by Jones , to cross the Potomac at night on April 21 . Instead of reaching Virginia , however , they mistakenly navigated upriver to a bend in the broad Potomac River , coming ashore again in Maryland on April 22 . The 23 @-@ year @-@ old Herold knew the area well , having frequently hunted there , and recognized a nearby farm as belonging to a Confederate sympathizer . The farmer led them to his son @-@ in @-@ law , Col. John J. Hughes , who provided the fugitives with food and a hideout until nightfall , for a second attempt to row across the river to Virginia . Booth wrote in his diary , " With every man 's hand against me , I am here in despair . And why ; For doing what Brutus was honored for ... And yet I for striking down a greater tyrant than they ever knew am looked upon as a common cutthroat . " The pair finally reached the Virginia shore near Machodoc Creek before dawn on April 23 . There , they made contact with Thomas Harbin , whom Booth had previously brought into his erstwhile kidnapping plot . Harbin took Booth and Herold to another Confederate agent in the area , William Bryant , who supplied them with horses . 
 While Lincoln 's funeral train was in New York City on April 24 , Lieutenant Edward P. Doherty was dispatched from Washington at 2 p.m. with a detachment of 26 Union soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry Regiment to capture Booth in Virginia . Accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Everton Conger , an intelligence officer assigned by Lafayette Baker , the detachment steamed 70 miles ( 113 km ) down the Potomac River on a boat , the John S. Ide , landing at Belle Plain , Virginia , at 10 p.m. The pursuers crossed the Rappahannock River and tracked Booth and Herold to Richard H. Garrett 's farm , just south of Port Royal , Caroline County , Virginia . Booth and Herold had been led to the farm on April 24 by William S. Jett , a former private in the 9th Virginia Cavalry whom they had met before crossing the Rappahannock . The Garretts were unaware of Lincoln 's assassination ; Booth was introduced to them as " James W. Boyd " , a Confederate soldier who , they were told , had been wounded in the battle of Petersburg and was returning home . 
 Garrett 's 11 @-@ year @-@ old son , Richard , was an eyewitness . In later years , he became a Baptist minister and widely lectured on the events of Booth 's demise at his family 's farm . In 1921 , Garrett 's lecture was published in the Confederate Veteran as the " True Story of the Capture of John Wilkes Booth . " According to his account , Booth and Herold arrived at the Garretts ' farm , located on the road to Bowling Green , around 3 p.m. on Monday afternoon . Because Confederate mail delivery had ceased with the collapse of the Confederate government , he explained , the Garretts were unaware of Lincoln 's assassination . After having dinner with the Garretts that evening , Booth learned of the surrender of Johnston 's army . The last Confederate armed force of any size , its capitulation meant that the Civil War was unquestionably over and Booth 's attempt to save the Confederacy by Lincoln 's assassination had failed . The Garretts also finally learned of Lincoln 's death and the substantial reward for Booth 's capture . Booth , said Garrett , displayed no reaction , other than to ask if the family would turn in the fugitive should they have the opportunity . Still not aware of their guest 's true identity , one of the older Garrett sons averred that they might , if only because they needed the money . The next day , Booth told the Garretts he intended to reach Mexico , drawing a route on a map of theirs . However , biographer Theodore Roscoe said of Garrett 's account , " Almost nothing written or testified in respect to the doings of the fugitives at Garrett 's farm can be taken at face value . Nobody knows exactly what Booth said to the Garretts , or they to him . " 
 = = Death = = 
 Conger tracked down Jett and interrogated him , learning of Booth 's location at the Garrett farm . Before dawn on April 26 , the soldiers caught up with the fugitives , who were hiding in Garrett 's tobacco barn . David Herold surrendered , but Booth refused Conger 's demand to surrender , saying " I prefer to come out and fight " ; the soldiers then set the barn on fire . As Booth moved about inside the blazing barn , Sergeant Boston Corbett shot him . According to Corbett 's later account , he fired at Booth because the fugitive " raised his pistol to shoot " at them . Conger 's report to Stanton , however , stated that Corbett shot Booth " without order , pretext or excuse , " and recommended that Corbett be punished for disobeying orders to take Booth alive . Booth , fatally wounded in the neck , was dragged from the barn to the porch of Garrett 's farmhouse , where he died three hours later , aged 26 . The bullet had pierced three vertebrae and partially severed his spinal cord , paralyzing him . In his dying moments , he reportedly whispered , " Tell my mother I died for my country . " Asking that his hands be raised to his face so he could see them , Booth uttered his last words , " Useless , useless , " and died as dawn was breaking . In Booth 's pockets were found a compass , a candle , pictures of five women ( actresses Alice Grey , Helen Western , Effie <unk> , Fannie Brown , and Booth 's fiancée Lucy Hale ) , and his diary , where he had written of Lincoln 's death , " Our country owed all her troubles to him , and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment . " 
 Shortly after Booth 's death , his brother Edwin wrote to his sister Asia , " Think no more of him as your brother ; he is dead to us now , as he soon must be to all the world , but imagine the boy you loved to be in that better part of his spirit , in another world . " Asia also had in her possession a sealed letter Booth had given her in January 1865 for safekeeping , only to be opened upon his death . In the letter , Booth had written : 
 " I know how foolish I shall be deemed for undertaking such a step as this , where , on one side , I have many friends and everything to make me happy ... to give up all ... seems insane ; but God is my judge . I love justice more than I do a country that disowns it , more than fame or wealth . " 
 Booth 's letter , seized along with other family papers at Asia 's house by Federal troops and published by The New York Times while the manhunt was underway , explained his reasons for plotting against Lincoln . In it he said , " I have ever held the South was right . The very nomination of Abraham Lincoln , four years ago , spoke plainly war upon Southern rights and institutions . " The institution of " African slavery , " he had written , " is one of the greatest blessings that God has ever bestowed upon a favored nation " and Lincoln 's policy was one of " total annihilation . "

 Booth 's body was shrouded in a blanket and tied to the side of an old farm wagon for the trip back to Belle Plain . There , his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy . The body was identified there as Booth 's by more than ten people who knew him . Among the identifying features used to make sure that the man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials <unk> , and a distinct scar on the back of his neck . The third , fourth , and fifth vertebrae were removed during the autopsy to allow access to the bullet . These bones are still on display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington , D.C. The body was then buried in a storage room at the Old Penitentiary , later moved to a warehouse at the Washington Arsenal on October 1 , 1867 . In 1869 , the remains were once again identified before being released to the Booth family , where they were buried in the family plot at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore , after a burial ceremony conducted by Fleming James , minister of Christ Episcopal Church , in the presence of more than 40 people . By then , wrote scholar Russell Conwell after visiting homes in the vanquished former Confederate states , hatred of Lincoln still smoldered and " Photographs of Wilkes Booth , with the last words of great martyrs printed upon its borders ... adorn their drawing rooms " . 
 Eight others implicated in Lincoln 's assassination were tried by a military tribunal in Washington , D.C. , and found guilty on June 30 , 1865 . Mary Surratt , Lewis Powell , David Herold , and George Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7 , 1865 . Samuel Mudd , Samuel Arnold , and Michael O 'Laughlen were sentenced to life imprisonment at Fort Jefferson in Florida 's Dry Tortugas ; Edmund Spangler was given a six @-@ year term in prison . O ' <unk> died in a yellow fever epidemic there in 1867 . The others were eventually pardoned in February 1869 by President Andrew Johnson . 
 Forty years later , when the centenary of Lincoln 's birth was celebrated in 1909 , a border state official reflected on Booth 's assassination of Lincoln , " Confederate veterans held public services and gave public expression to the sentiment , that ' had Lincoln lived ' the days of reconstruction might have been softened and the era of good feeling ushered in earlier " . The majority of Northerners viewed Booth as a madman or monster who murdered the savior of the Union , while in the South , many cursed Booth for bringing upon them the harsh revenge of an incensed North instead of the reconciliation promised by Lincoln . A century later , Goodrich concluded in 2005 , " For millions of people , particularly in the South , it would be decades before the impact of the Lincoln assassination began to release its terrible hold on their lives " . 
 = = = Theories of Booth 's motivation = = = 
 Author Francis Wilson , 11 years old at the time of Lincoln 's assassination , wrote an epitaph of Booth in his 1929 book John Wilkes Booth : " In the terrible deed he committed , he was actuated by no thought of monetary gain , but by a self @-@ sacrificing , albeit wholly fanatical devotion to a cause he thought supreme . " Others have seen less unselfish motives such as shame , ambition , and sibling rivalry for achievement and fame . 
 = = = Theories of Booth 's escape = = = 
 In 1907 , Finis L. Bates wrote Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth , contending that a Booth look @-@ alike was mistakenly killed at the Garrett farm while Booth eluded his pursuers . Booth , said Bates , assumed the pseudonym " John St. Helen " and settled on the <unk> River near Glen Rose , Texas , and later moved to <unk> , Texas . After falling gravely ill and making a deathbed confession that he was the fugitive assassin , he recovered and fled , eventually committing suicide in 1903 in Enid , Oklahoma , under the alias " David E. George " . By 1913 , more than 70 @,@ 000 copies of the book had been sold , and Bates exhibited St. Helen 's mummified body in carnival sideshows . 
 In response , the Maryland Historical Society published an account in 1913 by then @-@ Baltimore mayor William M. Pegram , who had viewed Booth 's remains upon the casket 's arrival at the Weaver funeral home in Baltimore on February 18 , 1869 , for burial at Green Mount Cemetery . Pegram , who had known Booth well as a young man , submitted a sworn statement that the body he had seen in 1869 was Booth 's . Others positively identifying this body as Booth at the funeral home included Booth 's mother , brother , and sister , along with his dentist and other Baltimore acquaintances . Earlier , The New York Times had published an account by their reporter in 1911 detailing the burial of Booth 's body at the cemetery and those who were witnesses . The rumor periodically revived , as in the 1920s , when a corpse advertised as the " Man Who Shot Lincoln " was exhibited on a national tour by a carnival promoter . According to a 1938 article in the Saturday Evening Post , the exhibitor said he obtained St. Helen 's corpse from Bates ' widow . 
 The Lincoln Conspiracy , a book published in 1977 , contended there was a government plot to conceal Booth 's escape , reviving interest in the story and prompting the display of St. Helen 's mummified body in Chicago that year . The book sold more than one million copies and was made into a feature film called The Lincoln Conspiracy , which was theatrically released in 1977 . A 1998 book , The Curse of Cain : The Untold Story of John Wilkes Booth , contended that Booth had escaped , sought refuge in Japan and eventually returned to the United States . In 1994 two historians , together with several descendants , sought a court order for the exhumation of Booth 's body at Green Mount Cemetery , which was , according to their lawyer , " intended to prove or disprove longstanding theories on Booth 's escape " by conducting a photo @-@ superimposition analysis . The application was blocked , however , by Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Joseph H. H. Kaplan , who cited , among other things , " the unreliability of petitioners ' less @-@ than @-@ convincing escape / cover @-@ up theory " as a major factor in his decision . The Maryland Court of Special Appeals upheld the ruling . No gravestone marks the precise location where Booth is buried in the family 's gravesite . 
 In December 2010 , descendants of Edwin Booth reported that they obtained permission to exhume the Shakespearean actor 's body to obtain DNA samples . However , Bree Harvey , a spokesperson from the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge , Massachusetts , where Edwin Booth is buried , refuted reports that the family had contacted them and requested to exhume Edwin 's body . The family hopes to obtain DNA samples from artifacts belonging to John Wilkes , or from remains such as vertebrae stored at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland . On March 30 , 2013 , museum spokesperson Carol Johnson announced the family 's request to extract DNA from the vertebrae had been rejected .

 Watchmen is a 2009 film based on the twelve @-@ issue graphic novel series of the same name created by writer Alan Moore , artist Dave Gibbons , and colorist John Higgins , published by DC Comics between 1986 and 1987 . The graphic novel 's film rights were acquired by producer Lawrence Gordon in 1986 . Many problems halted the adaptation 's development , with four different studios and various directors and screenwriters being attached to the project through twenty years . In 2006 , Zack Snyder , who at the time was filming ' another comic book adaptation ' , was hired by Warner Bros. to helm Watchmen . Filming started in 2007 , and following deals with two of the previous companies involved in the development — Paramount Pictures was responsible for international distribution rights after budgetary issues in 2004 , resulting in a lawsuit by 20th Century Fox . Fox , which was already contacted by Gordon in 1987 , received $ 1 million of the gross — the Watchmen adaptation was finally released in March 2009 .

 In August 1986 , producer Lawrence Gordon acquired the film rights to Watchmen for 20th Century Fox , with producer Joel Silver working on the film . Fox asked author Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story , but when Moore declined the studio enlisted screenwriter Sam Hamm . On September 9 , 1988 , Hamm turned in his first draft , but said that condensing a 338 @-@ page , nine @-@ panel @-@ a @-@ page comic book into a 128 @-@ page script was arduous . He took the liberty of re @-@ writing Watchmen 's complicated ending into a " more manageable " conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox . Fox put the film into turnaround in 1991 , and Gordon set up the project at a new company , Largo International , with Fox distributing the film . Although Largo closed three years later , Fox was promised that they would be involved if the project was revived . 
 Gordon and Silver moved the project to Warner Bros. , where Terry Gilliam was attached to direct . Unsatisfied with how Hamm 's script fleshed out the characters , Gilliam brought in Charles McKeown to rewrite it . The second draft , which was credited to Gilliam , Warren Skaaren , and Hamm rather than McKeown , used the character Rorschach 's journal as a voice @-@ over , and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed . According to Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons , filming was to take place at Pinewood Studios . Silver wanted to cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Manhattan . Because both Gilliam and Silver 's previous films , The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and Die Hard 2 respectively , went over budget , they were only able to raise $ 25 million for the film — a quarter of the necessary budget . As a result , Gilliam abandoned the project , and ultimately decided that Watchmen was unfilmable . Gilliam explained , " Reducing [ the story ] to a two or two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hour film [ ... ] seemed to me to take away the essence of what Watchmen is about . " When Warner Bros. dropped the project , Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently . The director again declined , believing that the comic book would be better directed as a five @-@ hour miniseries . 
 In October 2001 , Gordon and Universal Studios signed screenwriter David Hayter to write and direct Watchmen in a " seven @-@ figure deal " . Hayter hoped to begin filming in early 2002 , but did not turn in his first draft until July 2002 . In May 2003 , Hayter said he had Alan Moore 's blessing on the film , despite Moore 's disagreement with the project since its first incarnation . In July 2003 , Watchmen producer Lloyd Levin announced the completion of Hayter 's script , which he called " a great adaptation [ ... ] that absolutely celebrates the book " . Ultimately , Hayter and the producers left Universal over creative differences , and in October 2003 , Gordon and Levin expressed interest in setting up Watchmen at Revolution Studios . The pair intended to shoot the film in Prague , but the project fell apart at Revolution Studios . 
 In July 2004 , it was announced Paramount Pictures would produce Watchmen , and they hired Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter 's script . Gordon and Levin remained attached , collaborating with Aronofsky 's producing partner , Eric Watson . Eventually , Aronofsky left to focus on The Fountain , and Paramount replaced him with Paul Greengrass , with a target release date of summer 2006 . At this time , Paddy Considine , was involved in negotiations for Rorschach . Jude Law ( a fan of the comic ) and Tom Cruise both lobbied for Ozymandias . Greengrass wanted Joaquin Phoenix for Dan Dreiberg and Hilary Swank as Laurie . To publicize the film , Paramount launched a now @-@ defunct Watchmen teaser website that had a message board as well as computer wallpaper available to download . Graphic artist Tristan <unk> drew designs of Dr. Manhattan for the film , which depicted him with visible intestines . Gilliam read Greengrass 's revision of Hayter 's script and liked it , but told the director he did not think the studio would greenlight such a dark film . In March 2005 , with rumors that high @-@ profile projects , including Watchmen , were in danger of being cut , Paramount 's CEO Donald De Line began urging a reduction in Watchmen 's budget so the film could get the greenlight . When Brad Grey took over as Paramount ’ s CEO , Levin feared potential budget cuts , so he made plans to move the project outside the UK in an effort to save money . Before he could , Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround , again . 
 In October 2005 , Gordon and Levin began talks with Warner Bros. , originally the second studio to be attached to Watchmen , and confirmed in December 2005 that Warner Bros. had picked up the film , but that Greengrass was no longer attached to direct . In addition , the film was marked as an " open writing assignment " , which meant David Hayter 's script would be put aside . Despite this change , Hayter expressed his hope that his script would be used by Warner Bros. and that he would be attached to direct his " dream project " . 
 = = = Successful development = = = 
 After Warner Bros. officially became involved , the studio claimed that because Paramount had not fully reimbursed Universal for its development costs , Paramount had no legal claim over the film rights . Therefore , it would not be entitled to co @-@ finance the film with Warner Bros. After negotiations between the studios , they agreed that Paramount would own 25 % of the film and would distribute it outside North America . Impressed with Zack Snyder 's work on the film 300 , an adaptation of Frank Miller 's comic book of the same name , Warner Bros. approached him to direct an adaptation of Watchmen . After spending a couple of weeks deciding whether he wanted to direct the film or not , Warner Bros. officially announced Snyder ’ s hiring on June 23 , 2006 , with Alex Tse attached to write the script . Drawing from " the best elements " from two of Hayter ’ s drafts , Tse ’ s script returned to the original Cold War setting of the Watchmen comic . Warner Bros. was open to keeping the 1980s setting , although less so to the R @-@ rating that Snyder wanted ; Snyder also decided to add a title montage sequence to introduce the audience to the alternate history of the United States that the film presented . Snyder kept the ending from one of Hayter 's drafts , which simplified details of the conspiracy within the story , because he felt it would allow more screen time to explore characters ' backstories . 
 Snyder said that he wanted the film to hold the same level of detail that was contained within the comic , with all of the easter eggs that were hidden within each frame of the comic ’ s panels . As such , Snyder used the comic book as his storyboard , travelling with a copy and making notes on its pages . Next to the novel , Snyder cited Taxi Driver and Seven as visual influences . To make the film more topical , Snyder emphasized the existing subplot concerning energy resources . Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman met with Snyder twice during the later stages of pre @-@ production to further revise the script , although Snyder explained the script was merely a document for the studio , and it was his storyboards that were his true guide while making the movie . James <unk> , author of The Physics of Superheroes , was also hired as a scientific consultant . 
 = = Production = = 
 Snyder hoped to have principal photography take place from June – September 2007 , but filming was delayed until September 17 , 2007 . Snyder wanted a $ 150 million budget , but Warner Bros. preferred the budget remain under $ 100 million ; the film ultimately finished with a budget of approximately $ 120 million . The production took place in Vancouver , where a New York City back lot was built . Sound stages were used for apartments and offices , while sequences on Mars and Antarctica were shot against green screens . Ten visual effects companies , Sony Pictures Imageworks and Intelligent Creatures among them , came on board to work on the film , which ended up having 1 @,@ 100 shots featuring effects , a quarter of them being computer @-@ generated imagery . 
 Comic book artists Adam Hughes and John Cassaday were hired to work on character and costume designs for the film . Costume tests were being done by March 2007 . 300 associate producer Wesley <unk> portrayed Rorschach in a costume test , which Snyder inserted into a trailer that accompanied the release of 300 . Although he intended to stay faithful to the look of the characters in the comic , Snyder wanted Nite Owl to look scarier and Ozymandias to possess authentic Egyptian attire and artifacts . Ultimately , <unk> , Nite Owl and Silk Spectre changed most from the comic , as Snyder felt " audiences might not appreciate the naiveté of the original costumes . So , there has been some effort to give them a [ ... ] modern look — and not modern in the sense of 2007 , but modern in terms of the superhero aesthetic " . Costume designer Michael Wilkinson added that the costumes had to look realistic and protective , and that the Nite Owl costume should reflect Dan 's interest in aerodynamics . The chain mail in his costume resemble a bird 's feathers . Snyder also wanted the costumes to " comment directly on many of today ’ s modern masked vigilantes " : The Ozymandias costume , with its molded muscles and nipples , parodies the costumes in Batman Forever and Batman & Robin . Throughout filming , Snyder also kept adding in dialogue to mention more of the characters ' backstories so the film would be as faithful as possible . 
 Production designer Alex McDowell intended Nixon 's war room to pay tribute to the war room in the film Dr. Strangelove . He also wanted Dr. Manhattan 's apartment , which is inside his laboratory , to look like the work of Maison Jansen , explaining that " the powers that be , who know nothing about design , but needed [ Manhattan ] to feel like he was the most important guy in America " . The apartment also echoes the film The Man Who Fell to Earth , with a book prop named Masterpieces in Paint and Poetry and a tennis courtroom with similar wallpaper . Set designers selected four Kansas City sculptors ' works for use on the set of Dr. Manhattan 's apartment , after discovering their works on the Internet . Filming ended on February 19 , 2008 .

 Composer Tyler Bates began scoring Watchmen in November 2007 . He planned to visit the shoot for a week during each month , and view assembly cuts of scenes to begin rough composing . Snyder and Bates listened to the soundtracks of 1980s films such as Manhunter , Blade Runner , and To Live and Die in L.A. for inspiration . Bates switched between a Yamaha CS @-@ 80 or an <unk> for moments that he felt should have more ambience or synthesizers . Snyder wanted a scene where Nite Owl and Silk Spectre rescue people from a burning building to have a more traditional superhero feel , so Bates implemented a four to the floor guitar rhythm . A 64 @-@ strong choir and the 87 @-@ piece ensemble from the Hollywood Studio Symphony were hired for the more orchestral themes . 
 The film uses some of the songs mentioned in the comic . Bates said the challenge was composing music that would transition effectively into these famous songs . One of the songs is " The Times They Are a @-@ Changin ' " by Bob Dylan from whom Snyder and Bates received permission to use the stems so the three @-@ minute song could play over the six @-@ minute opening montage . My Chemical Romance , whose members are fans of the comic , covered Dylan 's " Desolation Row " for the first half of the closing credits . The film also features two pieces from Philip Glass ' score to 1982 film Koyaanisqatsi accompanying the birth of Dr. Manhattan . 
 Two albums , Watchmen : Music from the Motion Picture and Watchmen : Original Motion Picture Score were released on February 24 , 2009 by Warner Sunset and Reprise Records . Additionally , a 12 " vinyl picture disc was released on January 27 , 2009 . The A @-@ side features My Chemical Romance 's cover version of " Desolation Row " , and the B @-@ side features " Prison Fight " composed by Tyler Bates for the film 's score . Both songs will also be featured on the Music From the Motion Picture and Original Motion Picture Soundtrack albums , respectively . A box set consisting of seven 7 " picture disks was released on March 24 , 2009 . This set will also include My Chemical Romance performing " Desolation Row " , as well as thirteen tracks from the Tyler Bates score .

 Snyder 's first cut of the film was three hours long . In keeping the film tight , Snyder dubbed himself " the gatekeeper " of the comic 's easter eggs , " while [ the studio ] conspire to say , ' No . Length , length , length . <unk> . ' [ ... ] I 've lost perspective on that now , because to me , the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody . Like , people will go , ' We 've got to cut . You don 't need that shot of Hollis Mason 's garage sign . ' And I 'm like , ' What are you talking about ? Of course you do . Are you crazy ? How will people enjoy the movie without shit like that in it ? ' So it 's hard for me . " Snyder cut the film down to 162 minutes when he realized there was a way to further trim the film : removing the murder of Hollis Mason , the first Nite Owl , which " was easy without destroying the movie " . 
 = = = Moore and Gibbons ' involvement = = = 
 When 20th Century Fox acquired the film rights to Watchmen , the comic 's writer Alan Moore was initially excited about the film adaptation . In a 1987 edition of Comics Interview , he revealed Sam Hamm , who was attached to write , visited him in Northampton for lunch and that he felt Hamm would provide an adaptation faithful to the comic 's spirit . Ultimately , Hamm 's script altered the ending , having Adrian Veidt die and Dr. Manhattan alter time so that Jon Osterman is not affected by the radiation . As a result , the remaining characters are teleported to the real world created as a result of time travel . In an interview with Variety 's Danny Graydon , during Warner Bros. ' s first possession of feature film rights for Watchmen , Moore changed his mind , adamantly opposing a film adaptation of his comic book . Moore felt that , contrary to others ’ opinion , the comic book was not cinematic . When he was approached by Terry Gilliam on how to film the comic book , Moore stated that he " didn 't think it was filmable " . Moore clarified for Graydon , " I didn 't design it to show off the similarities between cinema and comics , which are there , but in my opinion are fairly unremarkable . It was designed to show off the things that comics could do that cinema and literature couldn 't . " 
 In December 2001 , Moore further explained his opposition , citing how a reader can take the time to absorb the character backgrounds , by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had just read to past elements , but that film forces you to watch the story at 24 frames per second . Moore 's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was released , and he intends to give any resulting royalties from Watchmen to the comic 's artist , Dave Gibbons . In Moore ’ s opinion , Hayter ’ s script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic , but added that he would not be going to see the film when completed . Moore said , " My book is a comic book . Not a movie , not a novel . A comic book . It 's been made in a certain way , and designed to be read a certain way : in an armchair , nice and cozy next to a fire , with a steaming cup of coffee . " 
 In November 2006 , Zack Snyder said that he hoped to speak to Moore before filming , though the writer had sworn off involvement with film or television productions after his disagreement over the V for Vendetta film adaptation . Moore signed a deal to go uncredited on the film , and for his share of the income be given to Gibbons , as he had done on V for Vendetta . Before filming began , Snyder said , " [ I ] totally respect his wishes to not be involved in the movie . " Moore expressed discontent over the choice of the director , saying that he " had a lot of problems " with the comic book 300 and that , while he had not seen it , he had heard that Snyder 's film adaptation was racist , homophobic , and " sublimely stupid " . 
 In an early interview with Entertainment Weekly 's Ken Tucker , Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons said that he thought the time had passed to make a Watchmen movie . Gibbons felt that the window to make a Watchmen movie was during the success of the 1989 Batman film . When that time passed , Gibbons also told Neon magazine that he was " [ … ] glad because it wouldn 't have been up to the book " . Gibbons felt it would probably be better adapted as a television series like The Prisoner . When given the opportunity , Gibbons enjoyed the script by Alex Tse . Gibbons gave Snyder some script advice , which the director accepted . He drew licensing art for the film , consulted on merchandise and the webcomics , publicized the film with Snyder , and wrote a tie @-@ in book about the creation of the comic , entitled Watching the Watchmen . Moore did not mind Gibbons ' involvement and felt it did not have any impact on their friendship . Snyder asked Gibbons to draw up a storyboard for the film 's altered ending , which the comics ' colorist John Higgins also returned to work on . Gibbons believed watching the film on DVD would emulate flipping through the book , with viewers pausing or rewinding the film to catch details . 
 = = = Litigation = = = 
 On February 14 , 2008 , 20th Century Fox brought a lawsuit against Warner Bros. that alleged copyright infringement on the Watchmen film property . The studio believed it held the rights to produce the film , or at least distribute it , no matter how many studios Watchmen passed through , and sought to block its release . Warner Bros. said that Fox repeatedly failed to exercise its rights over various incarnations of the production . Through producer Lawrence Gordon , Fox had bought the rights to the comic book in 1986 . Fox alleges that when it put the project into turnaround in 1994 , a separate 1991 deal that transferred some of the rights to Gordon still gave them the option of distribution , sequel rights , and a share of the profits should it be made by any other studio . Fox 's interpretation of the 1994 turnaround deal also meant that Gordon would not fully control the rights until the studio 's development costs — estimated by Fox at $ 1 million — had been reimbursed . Despite originally passing on the project , Fox also alleged that its agreement with Gordon contained a " changed elements " clause , meaning that if Gordon changed any of the key creative personnel on the film , Fox would have first option on participation , claiming that Gordon did not inform them of Snyder 's joining the production in 2005 . 
 Fox alleged that it contacted Warner Bros. before production began in 2005 , and told the studio that it had violated Fox 's 1991 and 1994 deals with Gordon . Warner Bros. claimed that it was originally unaware of either deal , and that in 2005 Fox had declined to produce the Hayter screenplay that formed the basis of the production . Warner Bros. also claimed that the 1994 deal did not cover distribution rights and had conferred upon Gordon all the rights he needed to take the film to Warner Bros. The studio 's motion to dismiss the case in August 2008 was rejected by the judge . 
 On December 24 , 2008 , Judge Gary A. <unk> granted 20th Century Fox 's claim to a copyright interest in the film . An attorney for 20th Century Fox said that the studio would seek an order to delay the release of Watchmen . Producer Lloyd Levin revealed in an open letter that in 2005 both Fox and Warner Bros. were offered the chance to make Watchmen . Fox passed on the project while Warner Bros. made a deal to acquire the movie rights and move forward with development . An internal Fox email documented that executives at Fox felt the script was " one of the most unintelligible pieces of shit they had read in years " . On January 15 , 2009 , the trade press reported that Fox and Warner Bros. had reached a settlement . Fox would receive a share of the box office , but no future ownership of the film . The settlement awarded Fox up to $ 10 million in development costs and legal fees , plus worldwide gross participation scaling from 5 to 8 @.@ 5 percent .

 Kawan Bergeloet ( Perfected Spelling : Kawan <unk> ; Indonesian for " Playmate " ) is a collection of short stories written by Soeman Hs and first published by Balai Pustaka in 1941 . It contains twelve stories , seven of which were previously published in the magazine Pandji Poestaka , as well as an introduction by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana . These stories are generally humorous in nature , and presented with a diction that shows strong east Sumatran influences . 
 Released in response to the commercial success of Mohammad Kasim 's collection Teman Doedoek , Kawan Bergeloet has been reprinted several times and received positive critical appraisal . Soeman , together with Kasim , has since been considered a pioneer of the Indonesian short story . The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw writes that the collection is Soeman 's most interesting contribution to Indonesian literature . 
 = = Background = = 
 Short stories and sketches in Malay have been recorded in Indonesia since the 1870s , and a short story collection — H. <unk> 's Warna Sari — was published in 1912 . These early stories used vernacular Malay and were often humourous or derived from fairy tales or detective fiction . Short story @-@ writing developed further in the 1920s and 1930s , when short stories and sketches in a more formal register of Malay were widely published in such magazines as Pandji Poestaka and Poedjangga Baroe . The first collection of short stories in the Indonesian literary canon , Mohammad Kasim 's Teman Doedoek , was published by Balai Pustaka in 1937 . This collection was a commercial success , selling 4 @,@ 000 copies by 1941 . 
 Teman Doedoek was read by Soeman Hs , a Bengkalis @-@ born teacher who had already gained popularity as a writer of detective fiction . Soeman , once a student of Kasim 's , had also experimented with more humorous story @-@ telling approaches , including in his novel Pertjobaan Setia as well as in the numerous short stories he had published through Pandji Pustaka . After the commercial success of Teman Doedoek , Balai Pustaka sought to release a new short story collection ; thus , Soeman was contacted .

 Kawan Bergeloet contains twelve short stories or sketches written by Soeman , seven of which had initially been written for and published in Pandji Poestaka . The remaining stories were written especially for the new collection .

 The Indonesian literary scholar Ajip Rosidi writes that the vast majority of the stories in Kawan Bergeloet are meant as comedy . He considers only one story — " Piloe " — to have been intended as more serious or sad . Several of the stories use tropes previously seen in Kasim 's Teman Doedoek , such as conflict arising from a misunderstanding , and the contents of some other stories are similar . 
 For Kawan Bergeloet , Soeman wrote in Indonesian , a language based on formal Malay . His diction and phrasing was strongly influenced by his east Sumatran background , with little influence from the language as spoken in Java . Rosidi considers his language to flow more easily than Kasim 's . John Wolff , the author of Indonesian Readings , sees Soeman as using " flourishes which echo folk @-@ tale stories " . 
 = = Publication and reception = = 
 Kawan Bergeloet was published by Balai Pustaka in 1941 , with the series number 1426 . The collection 's title , Kawan Bergeloet , has variously been translated as Playmates , Comrades Wrestling , and <unk> Companions ; the word <unk> , in Indonesian , can mean either " to wrestle " or " to laugh " . Rosidi , identifying <unk> as meaning " to laugh " , writes that the title was meant to indicate that the book was intended for entertainment purposes , to be read in one 's spare time . 
 Soeman gained recognition as a pioneer of the Indonesian short story for Kawan Bergeloet , and over subsequent decades was commonly mentioned with Kasim in histories of the literary form . The collection has been reissued several times . The third printing , in 1950 , introduced an updated spelling as well as nine illustrations by " <unk> " . The most recent edition was published in 1997 . The story " Papan Reklame " was reprinted in Indonesian Readings , a student reader for Indonesian as a foreign language , in 1978 . 
 Rosidi writes that Soeman 's greatest strength in Kawan Bergeloet is in his description . He considers the writer to have avoided clichéd descriptions , instead using " new and original " descriptions , metaphors , and turns of phrase . Rosidi considers some of the stories ' comic incidents to be overly complicated , but attributes this to Soeman 's previous activity in the detective genre . The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw finds the sketches in Kawan Bergeloet to be " well @-@ observed and realistically described " and Soeman 's most interesting contribution to Indonesian literature .

 = Flerovium = 
 Flerovium is a superheavy artificial chemical element with symbol Fl and atomic number 114 . It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element . The element is named after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna , Russia , where the element was discovered in 1998 . The name of the laboratory , in turn , honours the Russian physicist Georgy Flyorov ( <unk> in Cyrillic , hence the transliteration of " yo " to " e " ) . The name was adopted by IUPAC on 30 May 2012 . 
 In the periodic table of the elements , it is a transactinide element in the p @-@ block . It is a member of the 7th period and is the heaviest known member of the carbon group . Initial chemical studies performed in 2007 – 2008 indicated that flerovium was unexpectedly volatile for a group 14 element ; in preliminary results it even seemed to exhibit properties similar to those of the noble gases . More recent results show that flerovium 's reaction with gold is similar to that of copernicium , showing that it is a very volatile element that may even be gaseous at standard temperature and pressure , that it would show metallic properties , consistent with it being the heavier homologue of lead , and that it would be the least reactive metal in group 14 . 
 About 90 atoms of flerovium have been observed : 58 were synthesized directly , and the rest were made from the radioactive decay of heavier elements . All of these flerovium atoms have been shown to have mass numbers from 284 to 289 . The most stable known flerovium isotope , flerovium @-@ 289 , has a half @-@ life of around 2 @.@ 6 seconds , but it is possible that this isotope may have a nuclear isomer with a longer half @-@ life of 66 seconds ; this would be one of the longest half @-@ lives of any isotope of a superheavy element . Flerovium is predicted to be near the centre of the theorized island of stability , and it is expected that heavier flerovium isotopes , especially the possibly doubly magic flerovium @-@ 298 , may have even longer half @-@ lives . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Pre @-@ discovery = = = 
 From the late 1940s to the early 1960s , the early days of the synthesis of heavier and heavier transuranium elements , it was predicted that since such heavy elements did not occur naturally , they would have shorter and shorter half @-@ lives to spontaneous fission , until they stopped existing altogether at around element 108 ( now known as hassium ) . Initial work in the synthesis of the actinides appeared to confirm this . The nuclear shell model , introduced in the late 1960s , stated that the protons and neutrons formed shells within a nucleus , somewhat analogous to electrons forming electron shells within an atom . The noble gases are unreactive due to their having full electron shells ; thus it was theorized that elements with full nuclear shells – having so @-@ called " magic " numbers of protons or neutrons – would be stabilized against radioactive decay . A doubly magic isotope , having magic numbers of both protons and neutrons , would be especially stabilized , and it was calculated that the next doubly magic isotope after lead @-@ 208 would be flerovium @-@ 298 with 114 protons and 184 neutrons , which would form the centre of a so @-@ called " island of stability " . This island of stability , supposedly ranging from copernicium ( element 112 ) to ununoctium ( 118 ) , would come after a long " sea of instability " from elements 101 ( mendelevium ) to 111 ( roentgenium ) , and the flerovium isotopes in it were speculated in 1966 to have half @-@ lives in excess of a hundred million years . It took thirty years for the first isotopes of flerovium to be synthesized . More recent work suggests that the local islands of stability around hassium and flerovium are due to these nuclei being respectively deformed and oblate , which make them resistant to spontaneous fission , and that the true island of stability for spherical nuclei occurs at around <unk> @-@ 306 ( with 122 protons and 184 neutrons ) . 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 Flerovium was first synthesized in December 1998 by a team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research ( JINR ) in Dubna , Russia , led by Yuri Oganessian , who bombarded a target of plutonium @-@ 244 with accelerated nuclei of calcium @-@ 48 : 
 244 
 94Pu + 48 
 20Ca → 292 
 114Fl * → 289 
 114Fl + 3 1 
 0n 
 A single atom of flerovium , decaying by alpha emission with a lifetime of 30 @.@ 4 seconds , was detected . The decay energy measured was 9 @.@ 71 MeV , giving an expected half @-@ life of 2 – 23 s . This observation was assigned to the isotope flerovium @-@ 289 and was published in January 1999 . The experiment was later repeated , but an isotope with these decay properties was never found again and hence the exact identity of this activity is unknown . It is possible that it was due to the metastable isomer 289mFl . 
 Glenn T. Seaborg , a scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who had been involved in work to synthesize such superheavy elements , had said in December 1997 that " one of his longest @-@ lasting and most cherished dreams was to see one of these magic elements " ; he was told of the synthesis of flerovium by his colleague Albert Ghiorso soon after its publication in 1999 . Ghiorso later recalled : 
 I wanted Glenn to know , so I went to his bedside and told him . I thought I saw a gleam in his eye , but the next day when I went to visit him he didn 't remember seeing me . As a scientist , he had died when he had that stroke . 
 Seaborg died a month later , on 25 February 1999 . 
 = = = Road to confirmation = = = 
 In March 1999 , the same team replaced the 244Pu target with a 242Pu one in order to produce other flerovium isotopes . This time two atoms of flerovium were produced , decaying via alpha emission with a half @-@ life of 5 @.@ 5 s . They were assigned as 287Fl . This activity has not been seen again either , and it is unclear what nucleus was produced . It is possible that it was the meta @-@ stable isomer <unk> . 
 The now @-@ confirmed discovery of flerovium was made in June 1999 when the Dubna team repeated the first reaction from 1998 . This time , two atoms of element 114 were produced ; they alpha decayed with a half @-@ life of 2 @.@ 6 s , different from the 1998 result . This activity was initially assigned to 288Fl in error , due to the confusion regarding the previous observations that were assumed to come from 289Fl . Further work in December 2002 finally allowed a positive reassignment of the June 1999 atoms to 289Fl . 
 In May 2009 , the Joint Working Party ( JWP ) of IUPAC published a report on the discovery of copernicium in which they acknowledged the discovery of the isotope 283Cn . This implied the discovery of flerovium , from the acknowledgement of the data for the synthesis of 287Fl and 291Lv , which decay to 283Cn . The discovery of the isotopes flerovium @-@ 286 and <unk> was confirmed in January 2009 at Berkeley . This was followed by confirmation of flerovium @-@ 288 and <unk> in July 2009 at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung ( GSI ) in Germany . In 2011 , IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 1999 – 2007 . They found the early data inconclusive , but accepted the results of 2004 – 2007 as flerovium , and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered . 
 = = = Naming = = = 
 Using Mendeleev 's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements , flerovium is sometimes called eka @-@ lead . In 1979 , IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called <unk> ( with the corresponding symbol of <unk> ) , a systematic element name as a placeholder , until the discovery of the element is confirmed and a permanent name is decided on . Some scientists in the field called it " element 114 " , with the symbol of ( 114 ) or 114 . 
 According to IUPAC recommendations , the discoverer ( s ) of a new element has the right to suggest a name . After the discovery of flerovium and livermorium was recognized by IUPAC on 1 June 2011 , IUPAC asked the discovery team at the JINR to suggest permanent names for those two elements . The Dubna team chose to name element 114 flerovium ( symbol Fl ) , after the Russian Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions ( FLNR ) , named after the Soviet physicist Georgy Flyorov ( also spelled Flerov ) ; earlier reports claim the element name was directly proposed to honour Flerov . In accordance with the proposal received from the discoverers IUPAC officially named flerovium after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions ( an older name for the JINR ) , not after Flyorov himself . Flyorov is known for writing to Stalin in April 1942 and pointing out the silence in scientific journals in the field of nuclear fission in the United States , Great Britain , and Germany . Flyorov deduced that this research must have become classified information in those countries . Flyorov 's work and urgings led to the development of the USSR 's own atomic bomb project .

 The physical basis of the chemical periodicity governing the periodic table is the electron shell closures at each noble gas ( atomic numbers 2 , 10 , 18 , 36 , 54 , 86 , and 118 ) : as any further electrons must enter a new shell with higher energy , closed @-@ shell electron configurations are markedly more stable , leading to the relative inertness of the noble gases . Since protons and neutrons are also known to arrange themselves in closed nuclear shells , the same effect happens at nucleon shell closures , which happen at specific nucleon numbers often dubbed " magic numbers " . The known magic numbers are 2 , 8 , 20 , 28 , 50 , and 82 for protons and neutrons , and also 126 for neutrons . <unk> with magic proton and neutron numbers , such as helium @-@ 4 , oxygen @-@ 16 , calcium @-@ 48 , and lead @-@ 208 , are termed " doubly magic " and are very stable against decay . This property of increased nuclear stability is very important for superheavy elements : without any stabilization , their half @-@ lives would be expected by exponential extrapolation to be in the range of nanoseconds ( 10 − 9 s ) when element 110 ( darmstadtium ) is reached , because of the ever @-@ increasing repulsive electromagnetic forces between the positively charged protons that overcome the limited @-@ range strong nuclear force that holds the nucleus together . The next closed nucleon shells and hence magic numbers are thought to be at the centre of the long @-@ sought island of stability , where the half @-@ lives to alpha decay and spontaneous fission lengthen again . 
 Initially , by analogy with the neutron magic number 126 , the next proton shell was also expected to occur at element 126 , too far away from the synthesis capabilities of the mid @-@ 20th century to achieve much theoretical attention . In 1966 , new values for the potential and spin @-@ orbit interaction in this region of the periodic table contradicted this and predicted that the next proton shell would occur instead at element 114 , and that nuclides in this region would be as stable against spontaneous fission as many heavy nuclei such as lead @-@ 208 . The expected closed neutron shells in this region were at neutron number 184 or 196 , thus making 298Fl and <unk> candidates for being doubly magic . 1972 estimates predicted a half @-@ life of about a year for 298Fl , which was expected to be near a large island of stability with the longest half @-@ life at darmstadtium @-@ 294 ( 1010 years , comparable to that of 232Th ) . After the synthesis of the first isotopes of elements 112 through 118 at the turn of the 21st century , it was found that the synthesized neutron @-@ deficient isotopes were stabilized against fission . In 2008 it was thus hypothesized that the stabilization against fission of these nuclides was due to their being oblate nuclei , and that a region of oblate nuclei was centred on 288Fl . Additionally , new theoretical models showed that the expected gap in energy between the proton orbitals <unk> / 2 ( filled at element 114 ) and 2f5 / 2 ( filled at element 120 ) was smaller than expected , so that element 114 no longer appeared to be a stable spherical closed nuclear shell . The next doubly magic nucleus is now expected to be around 306Ubb , but the expected low half @-@ life and low production cross section of this nuclide makes its synthesis challenging . Nevertheless , the island of stability is still expected to exist in this region of the periodic table , and nearer its centre ( which has not been approached closely enough yet ) some nuclides , such as 291Uup and its alpha- and beta @-@ decay daughters , may be found to decay by positron emission or electron capture and thus move into the centre of the island . Due to the expected high fission barriers , any nucleus within this island of stability decays exclusively by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and beta decay , both of which would bring the nuclei closer to the beta stability line where the island is expected to be . Electron capture is needed to reach the island , which is problematic because it is not certain that electron capture becomes a major decay mode in this region of the chart of nuclides . 
 Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2004 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus <unk> by bombarding a plutonium @-@ 244 target with accelerated calcium @-@ 48 ions . A compound nucleus is a loose combination of nucleons that have not yet arranged themselves into nuclear shells . It has no internal structure and is held together only by the collision forces between the target and projectile nuclei . The results revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as calcium @-@ 40 , tin @-@ 132 , lead @-@ 208 , or bismuth @-@ 209 . It was also found that the yield for the fusion @-@ fission pathway was similar between calcium @-@ 48 and iron @-@ 58 projectiles , indicating a possible future use of iron @-@ 58 projectiles in superheavy element formation . It has also been suggested that a neutron @-@ rich flerovium isotope can be formed by the quasifission ( partial fusion followed by fission ) of a massive nucleus . Recently it has been shown that the multi @-@ nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei ( such as uranium and curium ) might be used to synthesize the neutron @-@ rich superheavy nuclei located at the island of stability , although production of neutron @-@ rich nobelium or seaborgium nuclei is more likely . 
 Theoretical estimation of the alpha decay half @-@ lives of the isotopes of the flerovium supports the experimental data . The fission @-@ survived isotope 298Fl , long expected to be doubly magic , is predicted to have alpha decay half @-@ life around 17 days . The direct synthesis of the nucleus 298Fl by a fusion – evaporation pathway is currently impossible since no known combination of target and stable projectile can provide 184 neutrons in the compound nucleus , and radioactive projectiles such as calcium @-@ 50 ( half @-@ life fourteen seconds ) cannot yet be used in the needed quantity and intensity . Currently , one possibility for the synthesis of the expected long @-@ lived nuclei of copernicium ( 291Cn and 293Cn ) and flerovium near the middle of the island include using even heavier targets such as curium @-@ 250 , berkelium @-@ 249 , californium @-@ 251 , and einsteinium @-@ 254 , that when fused with calcium @-@ 48 would produce nuclei such as 291Uup and 291Fl ( as decay products of <unk> , 295Uus , and 295Lv ) , with just enough neutrons to alpha decay to nuclides close enough to the centre of the island to possibly undergo electron capture and move inwards to the centre , though the cross sections would be small and little is yet known about the decay properties of superheavy nuclides near the beta stability line . This may be the best hope currently to synthesize nuclei on the island of stability , but it is speculative and may or may not work in practice . Another possibility is to use controlled nuclear explosions to achieve the high neutron flux necessary to create macroscopic amounts of such isotopes . This would mimic the r @-@ process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability after polonium bypassed , as it would bypass the gaps of instability at 258 – 260Fm and at mass number 275 ( atomic numbers 104 to 108 ) . Some such isotopes ( especially 291Cn and 293Cn ) may even have been synthesized in nature , but would have decayed away far too quickly ( with half @-@ lives of only thousands of years ) and be produced in far too small quantities ( about 10 − 12 the abundance of lead ) to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays .

 Flerovium is a member of group 14 in the periodic table , below carbon , silicon , germanium , tin , and lead . Every previous group 14 element has four electrons in its valence shell , forming a valence electron configuration of <unk> . In flerovium 's case , the trend will be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s27p2 ; flerovium will behave similarly to its lighter congeners in many respects . Differences are likely to arise ; a largely contributing effect is the spin – orbit ( SO ) interaction — the mutual interaction between the electrons ' motion and spin . It is especially strong for the superheavy elements , because their electrons move faster than in lighter atoms , at velocities comparable to the speed of light . In relation to flerovium atoms , it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels ( stabilizing the corresponding electrons ) , but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four . The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect , and the effect " tearing " the 7p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting . Computation chemists see the split as a change of the second ( azimuthal ) quantum number l from 1 to 1 ⁄ 2 and 3 ⁄ 2 for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the 7p subshell , respectively . For many theoretical purposes , the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s27p2 
 1 / 2 . These effects cause flerovium 's chemistry to be somewhat different from that of its lighter neighbours . 
 Due to the spin @-@ orbit splitting of the 7p subshell being very large in flerovium , and the fact that both flerovium 's filled orbitals in the seventh shell are stabilized relativistically , the valence electron configuration of flerovium may be considered to have a completely filled shell , making flerovium a very noble metal . Its first ionization energy of 8 @.@ 539 eV ( 823 @.@ 9 kJ / mol ) should be the highest in group 14 . The 6d electron levels are also destabilized , and may still be able to participate in chemical reactions in flerovium ( but not the later 7p elements ) , which might allow it to behave in some ways like transition metals and allow higher oxidation states such as + 4 and + 6 . They should be less stable than the + 2 state , following periodic trends , and may only be stable in flerovium fluorides . 
 The closed @-@ shell electron configuration of flerovium results in the metallic bonding in metallic flerovium being weaker than in the preceding and following elements ; thus , flerovium is expected to have a low boiling point , and has recently been suggested to be possibly a gaseous metal . The melting and boiling points of flerovium are predicted to be around 70 ° C and 150 ° C , significantly lower than the values for the lighter group 14 elements ( those of lead are 327 ° C and 1749 ° C respectively ) , and continuing the trend of decreasing boiling points down the group . Although earlier studies predicted a boiling point of ~ 1000 ° C or <unk> ° C , this is now considered unlikely because of the expected weak metallic bonding in flerovium and that group trends would expect flerovium to have a low sublimation enthalpy . In the solid state , flerovium is expected to be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight , with a density variously predicted to be either 22 g · cm − 3 or 14 g · cm − 3 . The electron of the hydrogen @-@ like flerovium ion ( oxidized so that it only has one electron , <unk> + ) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1 @.@ 79 times that of a stationary electron , due to relativistic effects . For comparison , the figures for hydrogen @-@ like lead and tin are expected to be 1 @.@ 25 and 1 @.@ 073 respectively . Flerovium would form weaker metal – metal bonds than lead and would be adsorbed less on surfaces . 
 = = = Chemical = = = 
 Flerovium is the heaviest known member of group 14 in the periodic table , below lead , and is projected to be the second member of the 7p series of chemical elements . The first five members of this group show the group oxidation state of + 4 and the latter members have an increasingly prominent + 2 chemistry due to the onset of the inert pair effect . Tin represents the point at which the stability of the + 2 and + 4 states are similar , and lead ( II ) is the most stable of all the chemically well @-@ understood group 14 elements in the + 2 oxidation state . The 7s orbitals are very highly stabilized in flerovium and thus a very large sp3 orbital hybridization is required to achieve the + 4 oxidation state , so flerovium is expected to be even more stable than lead in its strongly predominant + 2 oxidation state and its + 4 oxidation state should be highly unstable . For example , flerovium dioxide ( <unk> ) is expected to be highly unstable to decomposition into its constituent elements ( and would not be formed from the direct reaction of flerovium with oxygen ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) , which should have Fl – H bond lengths of 1 @.@ 787 Å , is predicted to be more thermodynamically unstable than plumbane , spontaneously decomposing into flerovium ( II ) hydride ( FlH2 ) and hydrogen gas . The only stable flerovium ( IV ) compound is expected to be the tetrafluoride , <unk> : even this may be due to sd hybridizations rather than sp3 hybridization , and its decomposition to the difluoride and fluorine gas would be exothermic . The gross destabilization of all the tetrahalides ( for example , <unk> is destabilized by about 400 kJ / mol ) is unfortunate because otherwise these compounds would be very useful in gas @-@ phase chemical studies of flerovium . The corresponding <unk> anion <unk> − 
 6 should be unstable to hydrolysis in aqueous solution , and flerovium ( II ) polyhalide anions such as <unk> − 
 3 and <unk> − 
 3 are predicted to form preferentially in flerovium @-@ containing solutions . The sd hybridizations would be possible as the 7s and 6d electrons in flerovium share approximately the same energy , perhaps making even higher oxidation states like + 6 possible with extremely electronegative elements , such as in flerovium ( VI ) fluoride ( <unk> ) . In general , the spin @-@ orbit contraction of the 7p1 / 2 orbital should lead to smaller bond lengths and larger bond angles : this has been theoretically confirmed in FlH2 . 
 Due to the relativistic stabilization of flerovium 's 7s27p2 
 1 / 2 valence electron configuration , the 0 oxidation state should also be more stable for flerovium than for lead , as the 7p1 / 2 electrons begin to also exhibit a mild inert pair effect : this stabilization of the neutral state may bring about some similarities between the behaviour of flerovium and the noble gas radon . Due to the expected relative inertness of flerovium , its diatomic compounds <unk> and <unk> should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding lead compounds <unk> and <unk> . Flerovium ( IV ) should be even more electronegative than lead ( IV ) ; lead ( IV ) has electronegativity 2 @.@ 33 on the Pauling scale ; the lead ( II ) value is only 1 @.@ 87 . 
 Flerovium ( II ) should be more stable than lead ( II ) , and polyhalide ions and compounds of types <unk> + , <unk> , <unk> − 
 3 , and <unk> − 
 4 ( X = Cl , Br , I ) are expected to form readily . Fluorine would be able to also form the unstable flerovium ( IV ) analogues . All the flerovium dihalides are expected to be stable ; with the difluoride being water @-@ soluble , spin @-@ orbit effects would destabilize flerovium dihydride ( FlH2 ) by almost 2 @.@ 6 eV ( 250 kJ / mol ) . In solution , flerovium would also form the <unk> <unk> ( <unk> − 
 2 ) in aqueous solution , analogous to <unk> . Flerovium ( II ) sulfate ( <unk> ) and sulfide ( <unk> ) should be very insoluble in water , and flerovium ( II ) acetate ( <unk> ) and nitrate ( Fl ( NO3 ) 2 ) should be quite water @-@ soluble . The standard electrode potential for the reduction of <unk> + ions to metallic flerovium is estimated to be around + 0 @.@ 9 V , confirming the increased stability of flerovium in the neutral state . In general , due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7p1 / 2 spinor , <unk> + is expected to have properties intermediate between those of Hg2 + or <unk> + and its lighter congener Pb2 + .

 Flerovium is currently the heaviest element to have had its chemistry experimentally investigated . Two experiments were performed in April – May 2007 in a joint FLNR @-@ PSI collaboration aiming to study the chemistry of copernicium . The first experiment involved the reaction 242Pu ( 48Ca , 3n ) 287Fl and the second the reaction 244Pu ( 48Ca , 4n ) 288Fl : these reactions produce short @-@ lived flerovium isotopes whose copernicium daughters would then be studied . The adsorption properties of the resultant atoms on a gold surface were compared with those of radon , as it was then expected that copernicium 's full @-@ shell electron configuration would lead to noble @-@ gas like behaviour . Noble gases interact with metal surfaces very weakly , which is uncharacteristic of metals . 
 The first experiment allowed detection of three atoms of 283Cn but also seemingly detected 1 atom of 287Fl . This result was a surprise given the transport time of the product atoms is ~ 2 s , so the flerovium atoms produced should have decayed to copernicium before adsorption . In the second reaction , 2 atoms of 288Fl and possibly 1 atom of 289Fl were detected . Two of the three atoms displayed adsorption characteristics associated with a volatile , noble @-@ gas @-@ like element , which has been suggested but is not predicted by more recent calculations . These experiments provided independent confirmation for the discovery of copernicium , flerovium , and livermorium via comparison with published decay data . Further experiments in 2008 to confirm this important result detected a single atom of 289Fl , and supported previous data showing flerovium having a noble @-@ gas @-@ like interaction with gold . 
 The experimental support for a noble @-@ gas @-@ like flerovium was soon to weaken abruptly . In 2009 and 2010 , the FLNR @-@ PSI collaboration synthesized further atoms of flerovium to follow up their 2007 and 2008 studies . In particular , the first three flerovium atoms synthesized in the 2010 study suggested again a noble @-@ gas @-@ like character , but the complete set taken together resulted in a more ambiguous interpretation , unusual for a metal in the carbon group but not fully like a noble gas in character . In their paper , the scientists refrained from calling flerovium 's chemical properties " close to those of noble gases " , as had previously been done in the 2008 study . Flerovium 's volatility was again measured through interactions with a gold surface , and provided indications that the volatility of flerovium was comparable to that of mercury , astatine , and the simultaneously investigated copernicium , which had been shown in the study to be a very volatile noble metal , conforming to its being the heaviest group 12 element known . Nevertheless , it was pointed out that this volatile behaviour was not expected for a usual group 14 metal . 
 In even later experiments from 2012 at the GSI , the chemical properties of flerovium were revealed to be more metallic than noble @-@ gas @-@ like . Jens Volker Kratz and Christoph <unk> specifically named copernicium and flerovium as belonging to a new category of " volatile metals " ; Kratz even speculated that they might be gaseous at standard temperature and pressure . These " volatile metals " , as a category , were expected to fall between normal metals and noble gases in terms of adsorption properties . Contrary to the 2009 and 2010 results , it was shown in the 2012 experiments that the interactions of flerovium and copernicium respectively with gold were about equal . Further studies showed that flerovium was more reactive than copernicium , in contradiction to previous experiments and predictions .

 Alexander Gillespie " Alex " Raymond ( October 2 , 1909 – September 6 , 1956 ) was an American cartoonist , best known for creating Flash Gordon for King Features in 1934 . The strip was subsequently adapted into many other media , from a series of movie serials ( 1936 – 1940 ) to a 1970s television series and a 1980 film . 
 Raymond 's father encouraged his love of drawing from an early age , leading him to become an assistant illustrator in the early 1930s on strips such as Tillie the Toiler and Tim Tyler 's Luck . Towards the end of 1933 , Raymond created the epic Flash Gordon science @-@ fiction comic strip to compete with the popular Buck Rogers comic strip and , before long , Flash was the more popular strip of the two . Raymond also worked on the jungle adventure saga Jungle Jim and spy adventure Secret Agent X @-@ 9 concurrently with Flash , though his increasing workload caused him to leave Secret Agent X @-@ 9 to another artist by 1935 . He left the strips in 1944 to join the Marines , saw combat in the Pacific Ocean theater in 1945 and was demobilized in 1946 . Upon his return from serving during World War II , Raymond created and illustrated the much @-@ heralded Rip Kirby , a private detective comic strip . In 1956 , Raymond was killed in a car crash at the age of 46 ; he was survived by his wife and five children . 
 He became known as " the artist 's artist " and his much @-@ imitated style can be seen on the many strips he illustrated . Raymond worked from live models furnished by Manhattan 's Walter Thornton Agency , as indicated in " Modern Jules Verne , " a profile of Raymond published in the Dell Four @-@ Color Flash Gordon # 10 ( 1942 ) , showing how Thornton model Patricia Quinn posed as a character in the strip . 
 Numerous artists have cited Raymond as an inspiration for their work , including comic artists Jack Kirby , Bob Kane , Russ Manning , and Al Williamson . George Lucas cited Raymond as a major influence for Star Wars . He was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1996 . Maurice Horn stated that Raymond unquestionably possessed " the most versatile talent " of all the comic strip creators . He has also described his style as " precise , clear , and incisive . " Carl Barks described Raymond as a man " who could combine craftsmanship with emotions and all the gimmicks that went into a good adventure strip . " Raymond 's influence on other cartoonists was considerable during his lifetime and did not diminish after his death . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life and career = = = 
 Raymond was born in New Rochelle , New York , the son of Beatrice <unk> ( née Crossley ) and Alexander Gillespie Raymond . Alex was Roman Catholic . His father was a civil engineer and road builder who encouraged his son 's love of drawing from an early age , even " covering one wall of his office in the Woolworth Building " with his young son 's work . After the death of his father when he was 12 , he felt that perhaps there was not as viable a future in art as he had hoped and attended Iona Prep on an athletic scholarship . 
 Raymond 's first job was as " an order clerk in Wall Street " . In the wake of the 1929 economic crisis , he " enrolled in the Grand Central School of Art in New York City " and began working as a solicitor for a mortgage broker . Approaching former neighbor Russ Westover , Raymond soon quit his job and by 1930 was assisting on Westover 's Tillie the Toiler , through which Raymond was " introduced to [ the ] King Features Syndicate " , where he became a staff artist and for which he would produce his greatest work . 
 Raymond was influenced by a variety of strip cartoonists and magazine illustrators , including Matt Clark , Franklin Booth and John La Gatta . From late 1931 to 1933 , Raymond assisted Lyman Young on Tim Tyler 's Luck , eventually becoming the ghost artist in " 1932 and 1933 ... [ on ] both the daily strip and the Sunday page " , turning it " into one of the most eye @-@ catching strips of the time " . Concurrently , Raymond assisted Chic Young on Blondie . 
 In 1933 , King Features assigned him to do the art for an espionage action @-@ adventure strip , Secret Agent X @-@ 9 , scripted by novelist Dashiell Hammett , and Raymond 's illustrative approach to that strip made him King Features ' leading talent . 
 = = = Flash Gordon , Jungle Jim and Secret Agent X @-@ 9 = = = 
 Towards the end of 1933 , King Features asked him to create a Sunday page that could compete with Buck Rogers in the 25th Century , a popular science @-@ fiction adventure strip that had debuted in 1929 and already spawned the rival Brick Bradford in 1933 . According to King Features , syndicate president Joe Connolly " gave Raymond an idea ... based on fantastic adventures similar to those of Jules Verne " . 
 Alongside ghostwriter Don Moore , a pulp @-@ fiction veteran , Raymond created the visually sumptuous science @-@ fiction epic comic strip Flash Gordon . The duo also created the " complementary strip , Jungle Jim , an adventurous saga set in South @-@ East Asia " , a topper which ran above Flash in some papers Raymond was concurrently illustrating Secret Agent X @-@ 9 , which premiered January 22 , 1934 , two weeks after the two other strips . It was Flash Gordon that would outlast the others , quickly " develop [ ing ] an audience far surpassing " that of Buck Rogers . Flash Gordon , wrote Stephen Becker , " was wittier and moved faster , " so " Buck 's position as America 's favorite sci @-@ fi hero " , wrote historian Bill Crouch , Jr . , " went down in flames to the artistic lash and spectacle of Alex Raymond 's virtuoso artwork . " Alex Raymond has stated , " I decided honestly that comic art is an art form in itself . It reflects the life and times more accurately and actually is more artistic than magazine illustration — since it is entirely creative . An illustrator works with camera and models ; a comic artist begins with a white sheet of paper and dreams up his own business — he is playwright , director , editor and artist at once . " A. E. Mendez has also stated that " Raymond ’ s achievements are chopped into bite @-@ sized pieces by the comic art cognoscenti . Lost in the worthwhile effort to distinguish comics as an art form , the romance , sweep and beauty of Raymond 's draftsmanship , his incomparable line work , is dismissed . To many , it 's just pretty pictures . Somehow or another , it 's OK for people like Caniff and Eisner to borrow from film . That ’ s real storytelling . But for Raymond to study illustrators , well , that 's just not comics . " 
 Debuting on January 7 , 1934 , Raymond 's first Flash strip introduced the " world @-@ famous polo player " , improbably roped into a space adventure alongside love @-@ interest Dale Arden and scientist Dr. Hans Zarkov . Transported by rocket to the planet Mongo , " which was about to collide with Earth " , the trio " immediately became embroiled in the affairs of Mongo 's inhabitants — particularly those of its insidious warlord , Ming " , who would become Flash Gordon 's nemesis throughout the franchise 's many incarnations . 
 Early in 1935 , Hammett decided to depart as writer of Secret Agent X @-@ 9 in order to pursue a career in Hollywood . While it has been presumed that Raymond took on the writing duties of the strip until a replacement could be found , biographer Tom Roberts instead believes that the strip was written by committee during editorial conference , a view R. C. Harvey believes is supported by the strips themselves . Saint author Leslie Charteris was hired to take over the writing of the strip in September 1935 , but the pair would only collaborate on one storyline . By the end of 1935 , " the [ work ] load was too much for Raymond , " who left Secret Agent X @-@ 9 to artist Charles Flanders , in order to devote more time to his meticulous Sunday pages . 
 Raymond 's work on X @-@ 9 is said to particularly reach for " the feel of the best pulp interior art of the time , " a style that would evolve with his own so @-@ called " great flourishes " and " later blossom to full effect in Flash Gordon and Jungle Jim " . " Under his pen , " writes Maurice Horn , his Sunday pages " became world famous ( especially Flash Gordon ) . " However , historian and critic R.C. Harvey argues that " despite Raymond 's great talent as an illustrator , his deployment of the comic @-@ strip medium ( on X @-@ 9 ) was not very impressive . " Harvey feels that Raymond 's work suffers in comparison to Milton Caniff 's contemporaneous work , with Raymond 's failings as a visual storyteller less noticeable on a weekly Sunday strip , where the space afforded played to his skills as an illustrator . 
 Raymond 's sensual artwork — for which the artist particularly " studied popular illustrators , " including pulp artist Matt Clark , whose work Raymond 's male figures particularly evoke — outshone its borders and " attracted far more loyal readers than ... [ the ] rather contrived and unconvincing adventure stories " his work depicted . Raymond swiftly became " among the most highly @-@ regarded — and most imitated — in all of comics " for his work on the weekly strip , with Harvey declaring his work on the strip " a technical virtuosity matched on the comics pages only by Harold Foster in Prince Valiant . " Raymond evolved the layout of the strip from a four @-@ tier strip in 1934 to a two @-@ tier strip in 1936 , reducing the number of panels but doubling their size . Combining this with a removal of dialogue from speech balloons to captions at the bottom of the panel afforded Raymond the space to create detailed and atmospheric backgrounds . Against these spacious backgrounds , the placement of characters in heroic pose " lent the entire enterprise a mythic air . " 
 Flash Gordon gained a daily strip in 1940 , illustrated by Austin Briggs . Raymond left the Sunday strip in 1944 to join the Marines , whereupon the daily strip was cancelled and Briggs assumed Sunday duties , continuing until 1948 . Briggs was succeeded on the Sundays by Emanuel " Mac " Raboy , while the daily strip was revised in 1951 by Dan Barry . Barry also took over Sunday duties after Raboy 's death in 1967 . 
 Run above Flash Gordon , Raymond 's Jungle Jim is described by Armando Mendez as " a thing of beauty ... always more than just a topper or a shallow response to Hal Foster 's exquisite Tarzan " . The companion strip evolved over time , morphing from an initial " two tiers and up to six panels [ layout ] , with speech balloons " into " a single row , of four very tall panels with declamatory text and static , vertical composition " . Raymond 's skill and artistic dexterity , however , kept the storytelling constant and the artwork vibrant . Jungle Jim was " set in contemporary times and the exotic Malay peninsula of islands , [ but ] was intended to hark back to the original tales of Kipling , Haggard and Burroughs " . 
 = = = Military career = = = 
 Raymond took the war in Europe seriously enough to incorporate it into his strips , with Flash returning to Earth in the Spring of 1941 . Jungle Jim found himself involved in the conflict too , fighting in the U.S. Army . Raymond was becoming " restive about doing his duty " , a restlessness increased by the knowledge that four of his five brothers were already enlisted . In February 1944 , Raymond left King Features and his work on the Sunday Flash Gordon / Jungle Jim pages to join the US Marines , commissioned as a captain and serving in the public @-@ relations arm . Raymond is quoted as stating " I just had to get into this fight ... I 've always been the kind of guy who gets a lump in his throat when a band plays the ' Star Spangled Banner ' " . 
 Shortly thereafter , he " was sent to Quantico for training in the curriculum of the Aviation Ground Officer 's School , " and was soon producing " posters and patriotic images from a government office in Philadelphia . " His most famous image from this time is " Marines at Prayer , " which " was destined to become a well @-@ known and well @-@ circulated image of Marines on a battlefield pausing for worship . " Raymond also " designed the official 1944 Marine Corps Christmas card . " Desiring " to get closer to the action , " he then trained at the Marine Corps Air Station in Santa Barbara before serving in the Pacific Ocean theater " on the 1945 cruise of the escort carrier USS Gilbert Islands . " Treated by his fellow marines ( who had been raised on Flash Gordon ) as a celebrity , he was nonetheless seen as " a down @-@ to @-@ earth fellow , " and well liked . He saw " a period of intense combat in June 1945 , " and was " made an honorary member of <unk> @-@ 143 in August 1945 . " Raymond had , in May 1945 , designed a squadron patch for the men of <unk> @-@ 143 , after which the " squadron adopted the new name ' The Rocket Raiders ' . " 
 He was demobilized as a Major in 1946 . Upon his return , Raymond was unable to return to Flash Gordon . King Features were not prepared to usurp Austin Briggs from the Sunday strip and pointed out that Raymond had left voluntarily to enlist . Relatives of Raymond recall the artist as resenting this decision , which left him feeling " cast off with so little regard . " However , King Features offered Raymond the opportunity to create a new strip . 
 = = = Rip Kirby = = = 
 Raymond 's " police daily strip , " named after its central character - J. Remington " Rip " Kirby - debuted on March 4 , 1946 , conceived ( and initially scripted ) by King Features editor Ward Greene . The plotting of the strips is harder to attribute , the scant evidence available supporting the notion that Raymond was more than simply an illustrator . However , as was relatively commonplace on such strips , published credit went to Raymond , whose name was the major selling feature ; the artist even managed to gain a part @-@ ownership deal with King and a better split of the profits than was usual . Rip Kirby was Raymond 's reintroduction to newspaper strips after the war , and he was quick to forge a new " up @-@ to @-@ date " style for the strip , while keeping ties to the audience he had built up with Flash Gordon , Jungle Jim , and Secret Agent X @-@ 9 . 
 Running alongside the post @-@ World War II reintegration of America 's military into civilian life , Rip ( like Raymond ) was " an ex @-@ Marine , " who " set himself up as a private detective " a vocation tailor @-@ made to provide daily thrills . 
 Described by Stephen Becker as " modern and almost too intellectual " , the strip eschewed many of the pulp fictional detective tropes ( e.g. alcoholism , two @-@ fisted assistants , and an assortment of interchangeable femmes fatale ) . Instead , " [ Rip ] did more <unk> than <unk> , and smoked a leisurely pipe while he did it ; " " had a frail , balding assistant ... instead of a two @-@ fisted sidekick ; " " had a steady girlfriend ... [ and ] [ i ] f that wasn 't enough , he even wore glasses ! Rip " lived and worked in a recognizable , glamorous , modern New York City on cases involving very human frailties and vice " , and " grew older as the strip progressed " , a continuity advancement little seen in the strips of the time ( although pioneered in " Gasoline Alley " and Mary Worth ) . Raymond noted the change in subject matter , commenting that " I wanted to do something different and more down to earth . " 
 Stylistically , " Raymond turned to the Cooper Studio @-@ Al Parker advertising style for inspiration , spurring a new generation of comic artists to follow a fresh direction " , that of " glorify [ ing ] contemporary post @-@ War American life " . Although the strip was published entirely in black and white , Raymond worked hard to add tone through artistic technique . " Raymond nevertheless [ colored ] through his use of varying linework ... [ creating ] color through contrast " . His new style was much imitated throughout the industry and became known as ' the Raymond style ' . 
 Circulation of the strip rose steadily , and it was the artist who was apportioned most of the praise - including being awarded the fourth Reuben Award in 1949 . He also served as the National Cartoonists Society 's president from 1950 until 1952 , putting into place the committee structure responsible for overseeing the organization , and threw himself into championing the medium as an art form . Raymond profited in recognizability as well as financially , and continued on the strip until his untimely death in September 1956 . His collaborator from 1952 was writer Fred Dickenson ( who wrote the strip for a further 34 years ) , and he was succeeded artistically by magazine and Prize Publications ' Young Romance illustrator John Prentice . Commentators have said that Prentice echoed the Rip Kirby artistic style , but lacked " Raymond 's excellent design sense , " although he continued to draw the strip until his retirement in 1999 , the strip itself concluding shortly after . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 In 1967 , Woody Gelman , under his Nostalgia Press imprint revived some of his earlier work . Regarded by Time magazine in 1974 — alongside Prince Valiant author @-@ illustrator Hal Foster — as " some sort of genius " , and described in Jerry <unk> and Hames Ware 's Who 's Who in American Comic Books as " [ p ] <unk> the most influential artist on early comic books " , Raymond 's legacy as an artistic inspiration is immense . Harvey argues that it is because of Raymond and Foster that the illustrative style became the dominant one used for adventure strips . " His work and Foster 's created the visual standard by which all such comic strips would henceforth be measured . " Biographer Tom Roberts also believes Raymond 's work on Rip Kirby " inspired all the soap opera style strips of the fifties and sixties " . Roberts argues that strips such as Apartment 3 @-@ G " can trace their origins to the success of Raymond 's strip " . Although his work was rarely seen outside of the newspaper " funny pages " , as Raymond preferred to focus his energies on strip work , he also produced a number of " illustrations for Blue Book , Look , Collier 's and Cosmopolitan " . as well as Esquire . 
 The " heightened realism " of Raymond 's photorealistic style has been " chastised for making his pictures too realistic , too gorgeous for its own sake " , although many commentators believe that this very method " plunges the reader into the story " . Raymond 's work has a " timeless appeal , " many aspects of which — including the use of feathering ( a shading technique in which a soft series of parallel lines helps to suggest the contour of an object ) — have inspired generations of cartoonists , his work becoming " the raw material for the swipe files of future generations " . His work on Rip Kirby is especially noted for its use of " sophisticated black spotting " , a technique Raymond used from <unk> " for pacing " reasons . Fellow @-@ cartoonist Stan Drake recalled that Raymond called his black areas " pools of quiet " , serving as they did " as a pause for the viewer , something to slow the eye across the strip 's panels " . 
 = = = Specific influences = = = 
 Alex Raymond 's " influence on other cartoonists was considerable during his lifetime and did not diminish after his death " . George Lucas has cited Raymond 's Flash Gordon as a major influence on his Star Wars films ( which , cyclically , inspired the 1980 Flash Gordon film ) , while Raymond 's long shadow has fallen across the comics industry ever since his work saw print . Comics artists who have cited Raymond as a particularly significant influence on their work include Murphy Anderson , Jim <unk> , Frank Brunner , John Buscema , Gene Colan , Dick <unk> , José Luis García @-@ López , Frank <unk> , Bob Haney , Jack Katz , Everett Raymond <unk> , Joe Kubert , Russ Manning , Mort Meskin , Sheldon Moldoff , Luis Garcia <unk> , Joe Orlando , Mac Raboy , John Romita Jr . , Kurt <unk> , Joe Sinnott , Dick Sprang and Alex Toth , among many others . 
 In particular , Raymond has been named as a key influence by many of the most influential and important comic book artists of all time . EC Comics @-@ staple Al Williamson cites Raymond as a major influence , and is quoted as saying that Raymond was " the reason I became an artist " . Indeed , Williamson ultimately assisted on the Flash Gordon strips in the mid @-@ 1950s , and Rip Kirby in the mid @-@ 1960s ( all post @-@ Raymond ) . Key Golden Age artists credit Raymond with influencing their work . The artistic creators of Batman ( Bob Kane ) and Superman ( Joe Shuster ) credit him ( alongside Milton Caniff , Billy DeBeck and Roy Crane ) as having had a strong influence on their artistic development . Decades later , the herald of the Silver Age ( and co @-@ creator of most of Marvel Comics 's pantheon of heroes ) , Jack " King " Kirby also credits Raymond , alongside fellow strip artist Hal Foster , as a particular influence and inspiration . 
 Cerebus creator Dave Sim has published a comic book since 2008 called <unk> which is an examination of Alex Raymond 's career ( and the techniques of other <unk> like Stan Drake and Al Williamson ) structured around a hypothetical storyline set during the last day of Raymond 's life . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 On September 6 , 1956 , Raymond was killed in an automobile accident in Westport , Connecticut . Driving fellow cartoonist Stan Drake 's 1956 Corvette at twice the 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) speed limit , he hit a tree and was killed . Roberts describes in his biography the circumstances as a result of the weather . Driving in the convertible with its top down , Raymond decided to reach his destination quicker rather than stop to put the top back up when rain started to fall . Drake was thrown clear of the crash , but Raymond , with his seat belt buckled , died instantly . Speculation surrounds the nature of his death , with some , Drake included , believing Raymond was suicidal . Raymond had been involved in four automobile accidents in the month prior to his death , which led Drake to say Raymond " had been trying to kill himself " . Author Arlen Schumer ascribes the motive for suicide as being related to Raymond 's personal life . Schumer alleges that Raymond had been having affairs , and that his wife was refusing to grant him a divorce . R. C. Harvey is dismissive of this motivation : " <unk> suicide strikes me as an odd way for a man of Raymond 's sophistication to react to his disappointment in romance " . Harvey also notes that no mention of any alleged affairs is made in Tom Robert 's biography , " probably out of consideration to Raymond 's surviving family " . Drake has also been quoted as speculating that Raymond " hit the accelerator by mistake " instead of the brake . Raymond is buried in St. John 's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Darien , Connecticut .

 Raymond married Helen Frances Williams on December 31 , 1930 , with whom he had five children . The names of his three daughters — Judith , Lynne and Helen — were immortalized in that of Rip Kirby 's girlfriend , Judith Lynne " Honey " Dorian .

 = Hurricane Kyle ( 2008 ) = 
 Hurricane Kyle was the eleventh tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season . It formed from a strong tropical disturbance that tracked across the northeastern Caribbean Sea in the third week of September . As a low pressure area , it moved slowly across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola , dumping torrential rains across those islands . 
 By September 24 , it began to track northward away from the islands , and developed enough strong thunderstorm activity near its center and a well @-@ defined enough circulation to be deemed a tropical storm on September 25 . It strengthened to a hurricane on September 27 west of Bermuda . It made landfall in Nova Scotia as a Category 1 hurricane late on September 28 , then became extratropical shortly afterward . 
 The precursor to Kyle produced torrential rainfall over Puerto Rico , resulting in six fatalities and $ 48 million in damages . Little impact was recorded in Hispanola and Bermuda as the system tracked northward . Along the eastern United States , rough seas resulted in two fatalities and as the storm made landfall in Canada , heavy rains fell in eastern Maine . In Canada , Kyle had relatively little impact , leaving $ 9 million in damages and no fatalities . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Kyle began as a weak area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on September 12 . The system tracked in a general westward direction with little convective development and tracked over the Leeward Islands on September 18 . An upper @-@ level trough situated over the eastern Caribbean Sea interacted with the wave , resulting in an increase in shower and thunderstorm activity . The following day , a larger surface circulation developed as the low moved towards the northwest . The wave later became separated from the low , with the wave continuing towards the west and the low tracking to the northwest . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) , at this time , were not anticipating significant development of the low as strong wind shear inhibited deep convection from forming . Around 1400 UTC on September 21 , a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) was issued for the system as convection developed around the center of circulation . 
 Around 0000 UTC on September 25 , the disturbance was sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression . Shortly after , the NHC issued their first advisory on the system as it intensified into a tropical storm , assigning it the name Kyle . The center of the storm was slightly elongated but moderate wind shear continued to impact the circulation . Kyle track northward in response to an area of high pressure east of Bermuda and an area of low pressure along the eastern United States . The sheared structure of the storm led to problems with recording the intensity of the storm throughout the day . Hurricane Hunters continuously flew into the storm to record information ; however , their estimates were considered too high as the storm was disorganized . 
 Late on September 26 , shear began to relax and deep convection redeveloped around the center of circulation and the forward motion of the storm began to increase . Several hours later , the storm made a sudden northwest jump due to a passing shortwave trough . By this time , Kyle was just below hurricane @-@ status , with sustained winds up to 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . Continued organization led to the storm attaining hurricane intensity at 1200 UTC on September 27 while located about 345 mi ( 555 km ) west of Bermuda . Upon attaining this intensity , the storm became embedded within an area strong , divergent , upper @-@ level winds . Increasing in forward motion , the center of Kyle was located along the southwestern edge of the deep convection . 
 By September 28 , the storm began to struggle maintaining its intensity due to increasing shear and cooling sea surface temperatures ; around 1200 UTC that day , the NHC assessed Kyle to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 85 mph ( 140 mph ) . Several hours later , the barometric pressure of the storm decreased to 984 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 06 inHg ) , the lowest during its existence . Around this time , the hurricane began to undergo an extratropical transition as it approached Nova Scotia . By the end of September 28 , little deep convection remained around the center of Kyle . Buoys nearby the storm recorded seas in excess of 36 ft ( 11 m ) and hurricane @-@ force winds as it neared landfall . It was estimated that Kyle made landfall near Yarmouth , Nova Scotia around 0000 UTC on September 29 with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . This marked the first time since Hurricane Juan in 2003 that a hurricane made landfall in Canada , exactly five years , to the day , prior . Shortly after landfall , the storm weakened below hurricane @-@ status and completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone . Throughout September 29 , the remnants slowed and the system attained frontal features . The following day the system moved over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence before being absorbed by another large extratropical cyclone .

 On September 22 , about 3 days before the system had formed into a tropical storm , its significant rainfall in the eastern Caribbean prompted flash flood warnings in Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands . In the Dominican Republic a green alert was issued for provinces in the eastern part of the nation . The next day yellow alerts were issued for eight provinces and red alerts in eight more . Evacuations began in vulnerable San Pedro de <unk> , La Romana , and Barahona and San Jose de <unk> . The system moved westward on September 23 , threatening Haiti with its rains which prompted the issuance of heavy rain warnings and a red alert warning by the nation 's government . 
 = = = Bermuda = = = 
 Early on September 26 , Tropical Storm Kyle was deemed to be a threat to Bermuda and a tropical storm watch was issued for the islands . Later that day the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning as the storm neared the island . The following day , the warning was discontinued as Hurricane Kyle bypassed the island . 
 = = = New England and Atlantic Canada = = = 
 On September 27 , the state of Maine issued its first hurricane watch in seventeen years with the predicted path to approach the eastern part of the state . The last hurricane watch issued for Maine was associated with Hurricane Bob in 1991 . Eastern Maine 's power company , Bangor Hydro @-@ Electric , prepared for potential outages and planned to have additional crews on duty . The system turned and missed the state , though . 
 The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued watches and warnings for parts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on September 27 , concurrent with the Maine warnings . New Brunswick Power indicated that repair crews were on standby and neighbouring utilities have been called to assist if needed . The Red Cross in New Brunswick also were checking equipment and supplies to meet any need that might arise . Hours before landfall , a hurricane warning was issued for portions of Nova Scotia . This was the first hurricane warning ever in Canada ( tropical storm and hurricane advisories were not issued in Canada prior to 2004 , a policy changed due to Hurricane Juan in 2003 ) .

 The precursor to Kyle produced record breaking rains over Puerto Rico from September 21 to 23 . With isolated maxima in excess of 30 inches ( 760 mm ) , rivers breached their flood walls and flooded low @-@ lying areas . In Patillas , a 500 @-@ year 24 ‑ hour rainfall event took place , with 22 @.@ 03 in ( 559 @.@ 5 mm ) falling from 8 a.m. on September 21 to 8 a.m. on September 22 . Some rivers rose more than 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) in 12 hours , leading to severe flooding . Three deaths were directly blamed on the system as a result of the floods and mudslides . Another three deaths were indirectly related due to stress induced heart attacks . Mudslides , triggered by the torrential rain , closed highways and schools . Damage to agriculture on the island was estimated to be $ 23 million and structural damage was estimated at $ 25 million , for a total of $ 48 million . In addition to the system 's rainfall , its winds whipped up 10 ft ( 3 m ) waves along the island 's southern coast . 
 = = = Hispanola = = = 
 Heavy rains on September 23 , produced by the tropical wave which would eventually become Kyle , caused renewed flooding in the already flood @-@ stricken areas of the Dominican Republic and Haiti . The <unk> River overflowed its banks , flooding parts of Jacmel , severely damaging homes . By September 26 , flash flooding impacted areas recovering from previous floods in the Dominican Republic . Rainfall totals in eastern parts of the Dominican Republic exceeded 16 in ( 410 mm ) .

 Between September 25 and 26 , the outer bands of Kyle brought sustained winds up to 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) and heavy rains that amounted to 1 @.@ 53 in ( 39 mm ) during the two @-@ day span in Bermuda . The heaviest rainfall fell mostly on the western coast of the island as a narrow band of moderate rainfall tracked through . No structural damage or injuries resulted from the passage of Kyle in Bermuda .

 Kyle produced high waves along the coast of Rhode Island as it moved northward . A newly married couple were killed when high waves knocked the wife into the rocky shores . Her husband jumped in to save her but was overcome by the waves himself . The bodies of the couple were found days later . Large swells produced by Kyle , enhanced by a strong onshore flow , caused significant beach erosion along the New Jersey coastline . Cuts up to 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) in beach dunes were recorded . Heavy rains from Kyle caused flash flooding in Hartford County , Connecticut , flooding six cars and numerous basements . Total damages in Hartford were estimated at $ 40 @,@ 000 . 
 Rainfall up to 5 in ( 127 mm ) in Massachusetts caused a river in Somerset to overflow its banks , flooding nearby areas with 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) of water . A large sinkhole formed on County Street and several cars were stranded in the floodwaters . Two people had to be rescued by boat when their car was overcome by the floodwaters . In addition , numerous basements were flooded . Damages in Bristol County were estimated at $ 25 @,@ 000 .

 As the storm made landfall in Nova Scotia , the outer bands produced heavy rains and strong winds over eastern Maine . Wind gusts were recorded up to 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) in coastal Hancock County . The strong winds toppled trees , leaving 500 customers without power . Rainfall generally amounted from 3 to 4 @.@ 5 in ( 76 @.@ 2 to 114 @.@ 3 mm ) , with a maximum of 7 @.@ 15 in ( 181 @.@ 61 mm ) in Sedgwick Ridge .

 = Bivalvia = 
 Bivalvia , in previous centuries referred to as the <unk> and <unk> , is a class of marine and freshwater molluscs that have laterally compressed bodies enclosed by a shell consisting of two hinged parts . Bivalves have no head , and they also lack a radula . They include clams , oysters , cockles , mussels , scallops , and numerous other families that live in saltwater , as well as a number of families that live in freshwater . The majority are filter feeders . The gills have evolved into <unk> , specialised organs for feeding and breathing . Most bivalves bury themselves in sediment , where they are relatively safe from predation . Others lie on the sea floor or attach themselves to rocks or other hard surfaces . A few bore into wood , clay , or stone and live inside these substances . Some bivalves , such as the scallops , can swim . 
 The shell of a bivalve is composed of calcium carbonate , and consists of two , usually similar , parts called valves . These are joined together along one edge ( the hinge line ) by a flexible ligament that , usually in conjunction with interlocking " teeth " on each of the valves , forms the hinge . This arrangement allows the shell to be opened and closed without the two halves detaching . The shell is typically bilaterally symmetrical , with the hinge lying in the sagittal plane . Adult shell sizes of bivalves vary from fractions of a millimetre to over a metre in length , but the majority of species do not exceed 10 cm ( 4 in ) . 
 Bivalves have long been a part of the diet of coastal human populations . Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans , and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food . Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques . A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing . Pearl oysters ( the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water ) are the most common source of natural pearls . The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork , and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons . Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution . 
 Bivalves appear in the fossil record first in the early Cambrian more than 500 million years ago . The total number of living species is about 9 @,@ 200 . These species are placed within 1 @,@ 260 genera and 106 families . Marine bivalves ( including brackish water and estuarine species ) represent about 8 @,@ 000 species , combined in four subclasses and 99 families with 1 @,@ 100 genera . The largest recent marine families are the <unk> , with more than 680 species and the <unk> and <unk> , each with over 500 species . The freshwater bivalves include seven families , the largest of which are the Unionidae , with about 700 species . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The taxonomic term Bivalvia was first used by Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758 to refer to animals having shells composed of two valves . More recently , the class was known as <unk> , meaning " axe @-@ foot " ( based on the shape of the foot of the animal when extended ) . 
 The name " bivalve " is derived from the Latin bis , meaning " two " , and <unk> , meaning " leaves of a door " . Not all animals with shells with two hinged parts are classified under Bivalvia ; other animals with paired valves include certain gastropods ( small sea snails in the family <unk> ) , members of the phylum Brachiopoda and the minute crustaceans known as ostracods and <unk> . 
 = = Anatomy = = 
 Bivalves vary greatly in overall shape . Some , such as the cockles , have shells that are nearly globular ; cockles can jump by bending and straightening their foot . Others , such as the razor clams , are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging . The <unk> , in the family <unk> have greatly elongated bodies , but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body , where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood . 
 = = = Mantle and shell = = = 
 Near the hinge of the shell is the umbo , often a rounded , knob @-@ like protuberance usually surrounding the beak . The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion of the shell , with extra material gradually being laid down along the margins on the opposite sides . The hinge point or line is the dorsal region of the shell , and the lower , curved margin is the ventral region . The anterior or front of the shell is where the byssus ( when present ) and foot are located , and the posterior of the shell is where the siphons are located . With the umbones / hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer 's left , the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right . 
 In all molluscs , the mantle forms a thin membrane that covers the animal 's body and extends out from it in flaps or lobes . In bivalves , the mantle lobes secrete the valves , and the mantle crest secretes the whole hinge mechanism consisting of ligament , byssus threads ( where present ) , and teeth . 
 Visible on the inside of most empty bivalve valves is a shiny curved line that runs more or less parallel to the outer margin of the shell and often connects the two adductor muscle scars ( if the animal had two adductor muscles ) . This line ( known as the pallial line ) exists because , parallel to the opening edge of the bivalve 's shell , the mantle is attached to the shell by a continuous narrow row of minute mantle retractor muscles . The function of these small muscles is to pull the loose edge of the mantle up out of harm 's way when this is necessary because of minor predation attempts . In many bivalves , the mantle edges fuse at the posterior end of the shell to form two siphons , through one of which water is inhaled , and the other expelled , for respiration and suspension feeding . Often , a pocket @-@ like space occurs into which the siphons fit when they are retracted . This is visible on the inside of the valve as an indentation on the pallial line which is known as the pallial sinus . 
 The shell is composed of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament . The valves are made of either calcite , as is the case in oysters , or both calcite and aragonite . Sometimes , the aragonite forms an inner , nacreous layer , as is the case in the order <unk> . In other taxa , alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down . The ligament and byssus , if calcified , are composed of aragonite . The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum , a skin @-@ like layer which is composed of a horny organic substance . The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle , and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded . The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted , with clams often having concentric striations , scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings . 
 The shell is added to in two ways ; the valves grow larger when more material is secreted by the mantle at the margin of the shell , and the valves themselves thicken gradually throughout the animal 's life as more calcareous matter is secreted by the mantle lobes . Although the ( sometimes faint ) concentric rings on the exterior of a valve are commonly described as " growth rings " or " growth lines " , a more accurate method for determining the age of a shell is by cutting a cross section through it and examining the incremental growth bands . Use of this technique has changed views on the longevity of many bivalves . For example , the soft @-@ shell clam ( Mya arenaria ) was thought to be short @-@ lived , but has now been shown to have a lifespan of at least 28 years . 
 The two valves of the bivalve shell are held together at the hinge by a ligament composed of two keratinised proteins , <unk> and <unk> . In different groups of bivalves , the ligament may be internal or external in position . The main function of the ligament ( as well as joining the valves together ) is to passively cause the shell to open . The shell is actively closed using the adductor muscle or muscles which are attached to the inner surface of both valves . The position of the muscles is often clearly visible on the inside of empty valves as circular or oval muscle scars . Along the hinge line of the shell are , in most cases , a number of hinge teeth which prevent the valves from moving laterally relative to one another . The arrangement of these teeth is often important in identifying bivalves . 
 = = = Nervous system = = = 
 The sedentary habits of the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs . The animals have no brain ; the nervous system consists of a nerve network and a series of paired ganglia . In all but the most primitive bivalves , two <unk> ganglia are on either side of the oesophagus . The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs , while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity . The pedal ganglia , which control the foot , are at its base , and the visceral ganglia , which can be quite large in swimming bivalves , are under the posterior adductor muscle . These ganglia are both connected to the <unk> ganglia by nerve fibres . Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them . 
 = = = = Senses = = = = 
 The sensory organs of bivalves are not well developed and are largely located on the posterior mantle margins . The organs are usually mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors , in some cases located on short tentacles . The chemoreceptor cells taste the water and are sensitive to touch . They are typically found near the siphons , but in some species , they fringe the entire mantle cavity . The osphradium is a patch of sensory cells located below the posterior adductor muscle that may serve to taste the water or measure its turbidity , but is probably not homologous with the structure of the same name found in snails and slugs . <unk> within the organism help the bivalve to sense and correct its orientation . Each statocyst consists of a small sac lined with sensory cilia that detect the movement of a mineral mass , a statolith , under gravity . In the order Anomalodesmata , the inhalant siphon is surrounded by vibration @-@ sensitive tentacles for detecting prey . 
 Many bivalves have no eyes , but a few members of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> have simple eyes on the margin of the mantle . These consist of a pit of photosensory cells and a lens . Scallops have more complex eyes with a lens , a two @-@ layered retina , and a concave mirror . All bivalves have light @-@ sensitive cells that can detect a shadow falling over the animal . 
 = = = Muscles = = = 
 The main muscular system in bivalves is the posterior and anterior adductor muscles , although the anterior muscles may be reduced or even lost in some species . These strong muscles connect the two valves and contract to close the shell . They work in opposition to the ligament which tends to pull the valves apart . In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve , such as the oysters and scallops , the anterior adductor muscle has been lost and the posterior muscle is positioned centrally . In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves , a single , central adductor muscle occurs . These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres , striated muscle bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull . 
 The mantle suspender muscles attach the mantle to the shell and leave an arc @-@ shaped scar on the inside of the valve , the pallial line . The paired pedal protractor and retractor muscles operate the animal 's foot . Some bivalves , such as oysters and most scallops , are unable to extend their foot and in them , these muscles are absent . Other paired muscles control the siphons and the byssus . 
 = = = Circulation and respiration = = = 
 Bivalves have an open circulatory system that bathes the organs in hemolymph . The heart has three chambers : two auricles receiving blood from the gills , and a single ventricle . The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta , and then to the rest of the body . Some bivalves have a single aorta , but most also have a second , usually smaller , aorta serving the hind parts of the animal . 
 Oxygen is absorbed into the hemolymph in the gills which provide the primary respiratory surface . The gills hang down into the mantle cavity , the wall of which provides a secondary respiratory surface being well supplied with capillaries . In species with no gills , such as the subclass Anomalodesmata , the wall of the mantle cavity is the only organ involved in respiration . Bivalves adapted to tidal environments can survive for several hours out of water by closing their shells tightly . Some freshwater species , when exposed to the air , can gape the shell slightly and gas exchange can take place . 
 The hemolymph usually lacks any respiratory pigment , although members of the families <unk> and <unk> are known to possess haemoglobin dissolved directly into the serum . In the carnivorous genus <unk> , the hemolymph has red <unk> containing a haemoglobin pigment . 
 = = = Digestive system = = = 
 = = = = Modes of feeding = = = = 
 Most bivalves are filter feeders , using their gills to capture particulate food such as phytoplankton from the water . The <unk> feed in a different way , scraping detritus from the seabed , and this may be the original mode of feeding used by all bivalves before the gills became adapted for filter feeding . These primitive bivalves hold on to the substratum with a pair of tentacles at the edge of the mouth , each of which has a single palp , or flap . The tentacles are covered in mucus , which traps the food , and cilia , which transport the particles back to the palps . These then sort the particles , rejecting those that are unsuitable or too large to digest , and conveying others to the mouth . 
 In the <unk> and <unk> , water is drawn into the shell from the posterior ventral surface of the animal , passes upwards through the gills , and doubles back to be expelled just above the intake . In burrowing species , there may be two elongated , retractable siphons reaching up to the seabed , one each for the inhalant and exhalant streams of water . The gills of filter @-@ feeding bivalves are known as <unk> and have become highly modified to increase their ability to capture food . For example , the cilia on the gills , which originally served to remove unwanted sediment , have become adapted to capture food particles , and transport them in a steady stream of mucus to the mouth . The filaments of the gills are also much longer than those in more primitive bivalves , and are folded over to create a groove through which food can be transported . The structure of the gills varies considerably , and can serve as a useful means for classifying bivalves into groups . 
 A few bivalves , such as the granular <unk> ( <unk> granulata ) , are carnivorous , eating much larger prey than the tiny microalgae consumed by other bivalves . In these animals , the gills are relatively small , and form a perforated barrier separating the main mantle cavity from a smaller chamber through which the water is exhaled . Muscles draw water in through the inhalant siphon which is modified into a cowl @-@ shaped organ , sucking in small crustaceans and worms at the same time . The siphon can be retracted quickly and inverted , bringing the prey within reach of the mouth . The gut is modified so that large food particles can be digested . 
 The unusual genus , <unk> , is endosymbiotic , being found only in the oesophagus of sea cucumbers . It has mantle folds that completely surround its small valves . When the sea cucumber sucks in sediment , the bivalve allows the water to pass over its gills and extracts fine organic particles . To prevent itself from being swept away , it attaches itself with <unk> threads to the host 's throat . The sea cucumber is unharmed . 
 = = = = Digestive tract = = = = 
 The digestive tract of typical bivalves consists of an oesophagus , stomach , and intestine . A number of digestive glands open into the stomach , often via a pair of diverticula ; these secrete enzymes to digest food in the stomach , but also include cells that phagocytose food particles , and digest them <unk> . In filter @-@ feeding bivalves , an elongated rod of solidified mucus referred to as the " crystalline style " projects into the stomach from an associated sac . <unk> in the sac cause the style to rotate , winding in a stream of food @-@ containing mucus from the mouth , and churning the stomach contents . This constant motion propels food particles into a sorting region at the rear of the stomach , which distributes smaller particles into the digestive glands , and heavier particles into the intestine . Waste material is consolidated in the rectum and voided as pellets into the <unk> water stream through an anal pore . Feeding and digestion are synchronized with diurnal and tidal cycles . 
 Carnivorous bivalves have a greatly reduced style , and a chitinous gizzard that helps grind up the food before digestion . In other ways , their gut is similar to that of filter @-@ feeding bivalves . 
 = = = <unk> system = = = 
 Like most other molluscs , the excretory organs of bivalves are a pair of nephridia . Each of these consists of a long , looped , glandular tube , which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart , and a bladder to store urine . The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium , and serve as extra filtration organs . Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings near the front of the upper part of the mantle cavity , from where it joins the stream of exhalant water . 
 = = = Reproduction and development = = = 
 The sexes are usually separate in bivalves but some hermaphroditism is known . The gonads are located close to the intestines , and either open into the nephridia , or through a separate pore into the mantle cavity . The ripe gonads of male and females release sperm and eggs into the water column . Spawning may take place continually or be triggered by environmental factors such as day length , water temperature , or the presence of sperm in the water . Some species are " dribble spawners " , but others release their gametes in batches or all at once . Mass spawning events sometimes take place when all the bivalves in an area synchronise their release of spawn . 
 Fertilization is usually external . Typically , a short stage lasts a few hours or days before the eggs hatch into trochophore larvae . These later develop into veliger larvae which settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis into juveniles that are sometimes ( for example in the case of oysters ) known as " spat " . In some species , such as those in the genus <unk> , females draw water containing sperm in through their inhalant siphons and fertilization takes place inside the female . These species then brood the young inside their mantle cavity , eventually releasing them into the water column as veliger larvae or as crawl @-@ away juveniles . 
 Most of the bivalve larvae that hatch from eggs in the water column feed on diatoms or other phytoplankton . In temperate regions , about 25 % of species are lecithotrophic , depending on nutrients stored in the yolk of the egg where the main energy source is lipids . The longer the period is before the larva first feeds , the larger the egg and yolk need to be . The reproductive cost of producing these energy @-@ rich eggs is high and they are usually smaller in number . For example , the Baltic <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) produces few , high @-@ energy eggs . The larvae hatching out of these rely on the energy reserves and do not feed . After about four days , they become D @-@ stage larvae , when they first develop hinged , D @-@ shaped valves . These larvae have a relatively small dispersal potential before settling out . The common mussel ( Mytilus edulis ) produces 10 times as many eggs that hatch into larvae and soon need to feed to survive and grow . They can disperse more widely as they remain planktonic for a much longer time . 
 Freshwater bivalves in the order <unk> have a different lifecycle . Sperm is drawn into a female 's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place . The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female 's shell . Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host . After several weeks they drop off their host , undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate . An advantage of this to the molluscs is that they can disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts , rather than being constantly swept downstream by the water flow . 
 Some of the species in the freshwater mussel family , Unionidae , commonly known as pocketbook mussels , have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy . The female 's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish , complete with fish @-@ like markings and false eyes . This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish . Some fish see the decoy as prey , while others see a conspecific . They approach for a closer look and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills , dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny , parasitic young . These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish 's gills , where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva . The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts . After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs . The fish are relatively unharmed . 
 = = Comparison with brachiopods = = 
 Brachiopods are shelled marine organisms that superficially resembled bivalves in that they are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts . However , brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line , and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle . The differences between the two groups are due to their separate ancestral origins . Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems , a case of convergent evolution . In modern times , brachiopods are not as common as bivalves .
