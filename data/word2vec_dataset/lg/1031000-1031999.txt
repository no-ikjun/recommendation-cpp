 Wenger and Mourinho did not shake hands after the final whistle ; Mourinho congratulated Arsenal 's players as they descended the Wembley steps upon lifting the Shield , but the Arsenal manager appeared to avoid his Chelsea counterpart after he had collected his winner 's medal . Asked about the incident , Mourinho said , " I shake the hands of everybody who left the stairs , right in front of my direction . " When asked about the incident , Wenger responded by saying " I shook a few hands today after the game , but nothing special there . " 
 In a post @-@ match interview , Mourinho credited Arsenal 's defensive approach and organisation , but felt " the best team lost " , arguing that Chelsea created more chances and showed more initiative . He went on to suggest that Arsenal betrayed their attacking philosophy , choosing to adopt a counterattacking approach . Although Wenger agreed his team were set @-@ up cautiously , he denied they abandoned their playing style : " ... we defend our game on togetherness and solidarity and on defending well and attacking well . " The Arsenal manager felt victory against Chelsea acted as a physiological boost for his players going into the new season , but was indifferent to his own record of beating Mourinho for the first time . 
 Terry was disappointed with the result , observing " No matter if it ’ s a friendly or a Community Shield , it ’ s a trophy at the end of the day , " but sought positives – focusing on how the players ' fitness levels were rising in time for the new season . Mertesacker was delighted with his team 's performance , describing it as the peak of their pre @-@ season preparations . 
 Both managers criticised the quality of the pitch ; Mourinho remarked that it " was a disaster ... so bad and so slow . " An FA spokesperson said : " We will continue to improve the quality of the pitch , which we have every confidence in . In this instance it is simply that the pitch is less mature than we would ordinarily wish given the summer concert season and the early start to the football calendar . "

 = Mycena adscendens = 
 Mycena adscendens , commonly known as the frosty bonnet , is a species of fungus in the family Mycenaceae . The fungus produces small white fruit bodies ( mushrooms ) with caps up to 7 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) in diameter that appear to be dusted with sugar @-@ like granules . Caps are supported by thin , hollow stems up to 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) long , which are set on a disc @-@ like base . It is distributed in the United States , where it has been found from Washington to California , Europe , and Turkey . The fruit bodies grow on fallen twigs and other woody debris on the forest floor , including fallen hazel nuts . The variety carpophila is known from Japan . There are several small white Mycena species that are similar in appearance to M. adscendens , some of which can be reliably distinguished only by examining microscopic characteristics . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species , originally named Agaricus adscendens by Wilhelm Gottfried <unk> in 1829 , was first collected in the Province of Brandenburg , in what was then the Kingdom of Prussia ( now Germany ) . It was Dutch mycologist Maas Geesteranus who assigned the species its current name in a 1981 publication . According to Maas Geesteranus , Miles Berkeley 's 1836 Agaricus <unk> is the same species as Mycena adscendens , as well as all later synonyms based on this basionym : Mycena tenerrima , published by Lucien Quélet in 1872 ; Prunulus <unk> by William Alphonso Murrill in 1916 ; and Karel Cejp 's 1930 <unk> tenerrima . Although Index Fungorum agrees with Maas Geesteranus 's synonymy , other authorities treat the species as independent . An additional synonym is Agaricus ( Mycena ) <unk> , described by Johann <unk> from Luxembourg in 1906 . 
 The variety M. adscendens var. carpophila , published by Dennis Desjardin in 1995 , was originally proposed as M. tenerrima var. carpophila by Jakob Emanuel Lange in 1914 . 
 Mycena adscendens is the type species of section <unk> of the genus Mycena , which contains white species with floccose caps ( covered with tufts of soft woolly hairs ) . Other members of this section include M. <unk> , M. <unk> , and M. nucicola . The mushroom is commonly known as the " frosty bonnet " . The specific epithet adscendens , derived from the Latin , means " ascending " or " curving up from a prostrate base " . <unk> derives from the Latin <unk> , meaning " tender " or " delicate " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is white and small , with a diameter typically ranging from 2 @.@ 5 to 7 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 to 0 @.@ 3 in ) . Initially convex to <unk> ( hood @-@ shaped ) , it flattens during maturity , developing visible surface grooves that correspond to the gills underneath the cap ; the surface may also be covered with glistening particles , remnants of the partial veil . The cap is pallid gray with a whitish margin when young , but soon becomes white overall . The flesh is membranous , fragile , and thin ( less than 0 @.@ 5 mm ) . The gills are free from attachment or narrowly attached ( adnexed ) to the stem . They are up to 0 @.@ 5 mm broad , distantly @-@ spaced ( usually numbering between 7 and 12 ) , and sometimes adhering to each other to form a slight collar ( a <unk> ) around the stem . They are translucent @-@ white throughout their development , with a fringed , white edge . The hollow stem is 0 @.@ 5 to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) long , and usually curved and threadlike . The bottom of the stem is enlarged into a slight bulb , which is initially nearly spherical . At the very base of the stem is a small , white , and hairy disk @-@ like base that attaches to the substrate . The edibility of the mushroom is unknown , but like many small Mycenas , they are insubstantial and not likely to be considered for the table . 
 The variety carpophila is characterized by its tiny white cap up to 1 mm in diameter , and narrowly conical caulocystidia ( cystidia found on the stem ) . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 Mycena adscendens produces a white spore print . The spores are broadly ellipsoid , amyloid , and have dimensions of 8 – 10 by 5 – 6 @.@ 5 µm . Basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are two @-@ spored , club @-@ shaped , and measure 14 – 17 by 7 – 9 µm . Pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill faces ) may be present or absent . If present , they are similar to the cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edges ) . The cheilocystidia are abundant , measuring 28 – 44 by 8 – 12 µm . They are variable in shape , often fusoid @-@ ventricose ( fuse @-@ shaped with a swollen center ) or with 2 – 3 needle @-@ like projections arising from the apex ; the projections are sometimes forked . The swollen parts of the cheilocystidia are covered with short rodlike protuberances or warts . The flesh of the gills is vinaceous @-@ brown when stained in iodine . The flesh of the cap is made up of greatly enlarged cells , with the surface covered with club @-@ shaped to almost globular cells measuring 25 – 40 by about 20 µm . Their walls are finely verrucose ( covered with small warts ) , and all but the verrucose cells are vinaceous @-@ brown in iodine . Clamp connections are abundant in the hyphae .

 Other Mycenas that resemble M. adscendens include M. <unk> and M. stylobates . The former is distinguished from M. adscendens by a stem base that is not swollen or disc @-@ like , the latter by its larger and sturdier fruit body and lack of granules on the cap . A poorly known Japanese species , M. <unk> , is similar to M. adscendens , but has non @-@ amyloid spores and lacks clamps . M. nucicola is most reliably distinguished from M. adscendens by microscopic characteristics : M. nucicola has four @-@ spored basidia , clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of the gill tissue , and the spores are less broad ( typically 4 @.@ 2 – 5 µm ) . The Finnish species M. occulta grows on the decaying needles of Norway spruce and Scots pine . It differs from M. adscendens in that its gills do not form a <unk> , it lacks clamps in the hyphae and cells of the hymenium , and the terminal cells in its cap cuticle are densely covered with protuberances . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Fruit bodies of Mycena adscendens are found scattered to grouped together in twos or threes on fallen twigs , bark , and woody debris of hardwoods during the spring and autumn ; it fruits less frequently on the wood of conifers . <unk> are most common after periods of wet weather . They are also found growing on hazel nuts that have fallen to the ground ; two other Mycenas known to grow on this substrate include M. <unk> and M. nucicola . In the United States , it is known from Washington to California . It is also found in Europe , and has been collected in <unk> Province , Turkey . The variety carpophila , originally described from Denmark , was reported from Japan in 2003 .

 Al @-@ Birwa ( Arabic : <unk> , also spelled al @-@ <unk> ) was a Palestinian Arab village , located 10 @.@ 5 kilometers ( 6 @.@ 5 mi ) east of Acre ( Akka ) . In 1945 , it had population of 1 @,@ 460 , of whom the majority were Muslims and a significant minority , Christians . Its total land area consisted of 13 @,@ 542 dunams ( 13 @.@ 5 square kilometers ) . The village was depopulated during the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War . 
 Al @-@ Birwa was mentioned in the mid @-@ 11th century CE by the Persian geographer Nasir Khusraw and was known to the Crusaders as " <unk> " . The village came under Mamluk rule in the late 13th century , and in the early 16th century , it was conquered by the Ottomans , who ruled it for four centuries . Travelers ' reports from the late 19th century documented that al @-@ Birwa had a mosque , a church , and an elementary school for boys ( a girls ' school was built in 1942 ) . 
 During British Mandate rule in Palestine , al @-@ Birwa was home to local power brokers , who mediated disputes in neighboring villages . Al @-@ Birwa became a center of rebel operations during the 1936 – 1939 revolt against British rule . By the 1940s , many of the village 's agrarian inhabitants lost their lands due to debt , and shifted to labor jobs in nearby cities , such as Haifa . However , the majority of the residents — men and women — continued to engage in farming , selling their olives , grains and other crops in the markets of Acre . Al @-@ Birwa was captured by the Israelis in early June 1948 , after which its local militia recaptured the village . Al @-@ Birwa was then permanently occupied by the Israelis in late June . Afterward , its inhabitants , including future Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish , fled to nearby villages or Lebanon . The Jewish communities of Yas 'ur and <unk> were established on al @-@ Birwa 's lands in 1949 and 1950 , respectively .

 Al @-@ Birwa was mentioned in 1047 CE , during Fatimid rule , when it was visited by the Persian geographer , Nasir Khusraw . He describes it as lying " between Acre and Damun " , and reports having visited what he described as the tombs of Simeon and Esau there . The Crusaders wrested control of Palestine from the Fatimids in 1099 . They referred to al @-@ Birwa as " <unk> " . In 1253 , John <unk> , the Crusader lord of Caesarea , sold al @-@ Birwa , along with several other villages , to the Knights Hospitaller . Al @-@ Birwa was mentioned as part of the Acre @-@ based Crusaders ' domain in the 1283 <unk> ( truce agreement ) with the Mamluks under Sultan al @-@ Mansur Qalawun . In the late 13th century , the Mamluks defeated and conquered the last Crusader outposts along Palestine 's northern coastline .

 Al @-@ Birwa came under Ottoman rule in 1517 , along with all of Palestine . In 1596 , al @-@ Birwa was a small village in the Akka Nahiya ( <unk> of Acre ) , part of the Safad Sanjak ( District of Safed ) . The village paid taxes on wheat , barley , fruit , beehives , and goats . According to Ottoman tax registers , al @-@ Birwa had 121 residents in 1596 . A map from Napoleon 's invasion of 1799 by French cartographer Pierre <unk> depicted al @-@ Birwa as " <unk> " , though its location on the map was misplaced . 
 In the late 19th century , al @-@ Birwa grew to be a large village , with a well in its southern area . To the north lay " beautiful olive @-@ groves and fruitful wheatfields , " as they were described by one Western traveller to the region in the mid @-@ 19th century . American biblical scholar Edward Robinson visited al @-@ Birwa in 1852 and noted that it was one of 18 villages in Palestine with an operating Christian ( Eastern Orthodox ) church . By 1859 , British Consul Edward T. Rogers recorded that al @-@ Birwa had approximately 900 inhabitants . The French explorer , Victor Guérin , who visited in 1875 , described the Christians of Birwa as Greek Orthodox , and noted that they had a " fairly new " church . In 1888 , the Ottomans built an elementary school for boys .

 In 1917 , during World War I , British forces drove out the Ottomans from Palestine and in 1920 , the British Mandate of Palestine was established . In the 1922 British census , al @-@ Birwa had a population of 807 , consisting of 735 Muslims and 72 Christians . The Christians were mostly Orthodox with five Anglicans . By the 1931 census , the population had increased to 996 , of which 884 were Muslims and 92 were Christians , living in a total of 224 houses . Cement roofs became widely used in al @-@ Birwa in the 1930s , during a time of significant expansion in the village . 
 A number of al @-@ Birwa 's inhabitants participated in the 1936 – 1939 Arab revolt against British rule and mass Jewish immigration in Palestine . A commander of the revolt for the Nazareth @-@ Tiberias region , Sheikh <unk> <unk> , was from al @-@ Birwa . He was arrested by the British and sentenced to life imprisonment . The British also executed eight residents of al @-@ Birwa who had participated in the revolt . Other rebel commanders and participants in the revolt from al @-@ Birwa included Asad Atallah , Mahmoud al @-@ <unk> , Saleh Mahmoud Me 'ari @-@ Abu Sa 'ud , Abd al @-@ Hamid Daher Me 'ari , Muhammad al @-@ Hajj Ali , Yusef Taha , Fadil Eid , Yousif Mai and Abbas al @-@ <unk> . A number of women from al @-@ Birwa participated in the revolt by transporting arms , water and food to rebels positioned among the hills in the vicinity . Elderly refugees from al @-@ Birwa interviewed in 2003 – 2004 recalled that during the revolt , local rebels set off a mine that hit a British military jeep on a road adjacent to al @-@ Birwa in August 1937 , prompting the British to launch punitive measures against the village . In particular , the British authorities gathered men from al @-@ Birwa and forced them to cut cactus plants near Acre and then placed the men on top of the cactuses . 
 In 1945 , al @-@ Birwa 's population was 1 @,@ 460 , of which 130 were Christians . Prominent families and landowners in the village included the Saad , Darwish , Abdullah , <unk> , <unk> , al @-@ <unk> , al @-@ <unk> , Najm , al @-@ <unk> , Khalid , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and al @-@ <unk> families . Socio @-@ economic status in the village was largely determined by land ownership . About 140 residents of the village were tenant farmers who worked for the major landowning <unk> , al @-@ Zayyat and <unk> families . According to intelligence gathered by the Haganah ( a Jewish paramilitary organization in Palestine ) , the traditional , local power brokers of the central Galilee were residents of al @-@ Birwa , who " resolved all conflicts in the nearby villages " . Haganah intelligence also reported that al @-@ Birwa 's inhabitants were " long @-@ lived , the majority reaching an age of over 100 years " . 
 By the 1940s , al @-@ Birwa had three olive oil presses , a mosque , a church , and approximately 300 houses . In addition to the Ottoman @-@ era boys ' school , an elementary school for girls was established in 1943 . By this time , many of the inhabitants lost all or part of their lands due to debts , and concurrently , men and women from al @-@ Birwa increasingly worked in public projects , such as road construction and the Haifa oil refinery , or in British military installations , to compensate for lost income . However , the main source of income remained agriculture , and the village 's principal crops were olives , wheat , barley , corn , sesame , and watermelons . In 1944 / 45 , residents of the village owned a total of 600 cattle , 3 @,@ 000 goats and 1 @,@ 000 chickens . Women , particularly young women from smaller landowning families , participated alongside the men of their family in working the land , while many women from landless families drew income as seasonal workers on other village residents ' lands . There were general , gender @-@ based divisions of labor , with women collecting well water , raising livestock , curdling milk , transporting goods to markets in Acre and collecting herbs ; men typically plowed and sowed seeds , and both men and women picked olives and harvested crops .

 Israeli forces from the Carmeli Brigade first captured al @-@ Birwa and positions overlooking it on 11 June 1948 as part of Operation Ben @-@ Ami , a day before the first truce of the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War . During the fighting , 45 elderly residents hid in the church with the priest . The defenders of the village surrendered after losing men and running out of ammunition . The residents took refuge in nearby villages for thirteen days . Nevertheless , clashes continued during the truce . According to local militiamen from al @-@ Birwa , 96 men from the village armed with rifles , and an equal amount of men armed with non @-@ firearms and unarmed women assembled near the front lines of the Arab Liberation Army ( ALA ) . The rifle @-@ armed force charged first across the front lines , followed by the men armed with axes , shovels , and sticks , and then the women who carried water to assist the wounded . Al @-@ Birwa 's ad @-@ hoc militia took the small force of Haganah soldiers ( who became part of the Israel Defense Forces on 26 May ) by surprise and forced them back a kilometer west of al @-@ Birwa . Afterward , al @-@ Birwa 's residents harvested their crops . They remained in the village until 24 June , when ALA commanders suggested that they join their families in the nearby villages . The militiamen claimed that the ALA stood by during the clashes because they did not receive orders from their superiors . 
 The Israelis announced that they had battled ALA units in the area , inflicting 100 casualties on 25 June . The New York Times reported that there was fighting in the village for two days and that United Nations ( UN ) observers were there investigating truce violations . It added that " a small Israeli garrison held al @-@ Birwa prior to the [ first ] truce " , but it fell to ALA troops based in Nazareth who launched a surprise attack . Some residents camped in the outskirts of the village and occasionally managed to enter and gather personal belongings . After the end of the first truce in mid @-@ July , al @-@ Birwa was captured by Israel during Operation <unk> . The ALA fought the Israelis to recapture al @-@ Birwa , but by 18 July , the village was firmly behind Israeli lines .

According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi , one of al @-@ Birwa 's schools , two shrines for local sages , and three houses remained standing as of 1982 . One of the shrines was domed and built of stone . Most of the structures stood amid cacti , weeds , olive and fig groves , and mulberry trees . Most of al @-@ Birwa 's inhabitants fled to nearby Arab towns and villages , including Tamra , Kabul , <unk> @-@ <unk> , Kafr <unk> , and other localities . Some fled to Lebanon , and ended up in the Shatila refugee camp , in the outskirts of Beirut , where Palestinian historian <unk> Nazzal interviewed them in 1973 . Among the refugees of al @-@ Birwa was Mahmoud Darwish , who was born in the village in 1941 and lived part of his childhood there . 
 In 1950 , Tawfik <unk> , an Arab member of the Knesset , raised the issue of the internally displaced refugees of al @-@ Birwa in the Knesset , demanding that they be allowed to return to their homes . Prime Minister David Ben @-@ Gurion replied in the negative , stating , " The questioner presented the facts inaccurately . Birwa is an abandoned village which was destroyed in the fighting . Its inhabitants cooperated with <unk> 's gangs . The Israel Defense Forces and the government did not treat them as they deserved , but permitted them to remain in villages near Birwa , and to become residents of Israel . The government of Israel treats them as it does the other residents of Israel and those lacking means of subsistence . A special body was established to deal with these refugees , to resettle and rehabilitate them , not necessarily in their former villages , and the resettlement of the refugees in Nazareth has already begun . " In December 1951 , the village site was declared a closed military zone .

 = Rockwell B @-@ 1 Lancer = 
 The Rockwell B @-@ 1 Lancer is a four @-@ engine supersonic variable @-@ sweep wing , jet @-@ powered heavy strategic bomber used by the United States Air Force ( USAF ) . It was first envisioned in the 1960s as a supersonic bomber with Mach 2 speed , and sufficient range and payload to replace the Boeing B @-@ 52 Stratofortress . It was developed into the B @-@ 1B , primarily a low @-@ level penetrator with long range and Mach 1 @.@ 25 speed capability at high altitude . It is commonly called the " Bone " ( originally from " B @-@ One " ) . 
 Designed by Rockwell International ( now part of Boeing ) , development was delayed multiple times over its history due to changes in the perceived need for manned bombers . The initial B @-@ 1A version was developed in the early 1970s , but its production was canceled , and only four prototypes were built . The need for a new platform once again surfaced in the early 1980s , and the aircraft resurfaced as the B @-@ 1B version with the focus on low @-@ level penetration bombing . However , by this point , development of stealth technology was promising an aircraft of dramatically improved capability . Production went ahead as the B version would be operational before the " Advanced Technology Bomber " ( which became the B @-@ 2 Spirit ) , during a period when the B @-@ 52 would be increasingly vulnerable . The B @-@ 1B entered service in 1986 with the USAF Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) as a nuclear bomber . 
 In the early 1990s , following the Gulf War and concurrent with the disestablishment of SAC and its reassignment to the newly formed Air Combat Command ( ACC ) , the B @-@ 1B was converted to conventional bombing use . It first served in combat during Operation Desert Fox in 1998 and again during the NATO action in Kosovo the following year . The B @-@ 1B has supported U.S. and NATO military forces in Afghanistan and Iraq . The B @-@ 1B is expected to continue to serve into the 2030s , with the Long Range Strike Bomber to start supplementing the B @-@ 1B in 2030 .

 = = = Background = = = 
 In 1955 the U.S. Air Force issued requirements for a new bomber combining the payload and range of the Boeing B @-@ 52 Stratofortress with the Mach 2 maximum speed of the Convair B @-@ 58 Hustler . In December 1957 , the U.S. Air Force selected North American Aviation 's proposal to replace the B @-@ 52 with the B @-@ 70 Valkyrie . The Valkyrie was a six @-@ engine bomber that could reach Mach 3 speeds at high altitude ( 70 @,@ 000 ft or 21 @,@ 000 m ) to avoid interceptor aircraft , the only effective anti @-@ bomber weapon in the 1950s . Soviet aircraft were already unable to intercept the high @-@ flying Lockheed U @-@ 2 ; the Valkyrie would fly at similar altitudes but much higher speeds . In combat , the B @-@ 70 was expected to simply fly right by the defenders . 
 By the late 1950s , however , anti @-@ aircraft surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles ( SAMs ) could threaten high @-@ altitude aircraft , as demonstrated by the 1960 downing of Gary Powers 's U @-@ 2 . The USAF Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) were aware of these developments and had begun moving its bombers to low @-@ level penetration even before the U @-@ 2 downing . This tactic greatly reduces radar detection distances by use of terrain masking ; using features of the terrain like hills and valleys , the line @-@ of @-@ sight from the radar to the bomber can be broken , rendering the radar ( and human observers ) incapable of seeing the target . Even at somewhat higher altitudes , radar systems of the era were subject to " clutter " from stray returns from the ground and other objects , requiring a minimum angle above the ground to be effective . Bombers flying at low altitudes could remain under these angles simply by keeping their distance from the radar sites . This combination of effects made SAMs of the era ineffective against low @-@ flying aircraft . The same effects also meant that low flying aircraft were difficult to detect by higher flying interceptor aircraft , since their radar systems could not readily pick out opposing aircraft against the clutter from ground reflections ( lack of look @-@ down / shoot @-@ down capability ) . 
 The switch from high @-@ altitude to low @-@ altitude flight profiles severely affected the B @-@ 70 , whose design was highly tuned to provide the desired high @-@ altitude performance . Planners outlined a series of low @-@ level profiles for the B @-@ 70 , but higher aerodynamic drag at low level limited the B @-@ 70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range . The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed , but less range than the B @-@ 52 it was meant to replace . Unsuited for the new low @-@ altitude role , and because of a growing shift to the intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) force , the B @-@ 70 bomber program was canceled in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy , and the two XB @-@ 70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program . 
 Although never intended for the low @-@ level role , the B @-@ 52 's flexibility allowed it to outlast its intended successor as the nature of the air war environment changed . The B @-@ 52 's huge fuel load allowed it to operate at lower altitudes for longer times , and the large airframe allowed the addition of improved radar jamming and deception suites to deal with radars . During the Vietnam War the concept that all future wars would be nuclear was turned on its head , and the " big belly " modifications increased the B @-@ 52 's total bomb load to 60 @,@ 000 pounds ( 27 @,@ 000 kg ) , turning it into a powerful tactical aircraft which could be used against ground troops along with strategic targets from high altitudes . The much smaller bomb bay of the B @-@ 70 would have made it much less useful in this role . 
 = = = Design studies and delays = = = 
 Although effective , the B @-@ 52 was not ideal for the low @-@ level role . This led to a number of aircraft designs known as penetrators , which were tuned specifically for long @-@ range low @-@ altitude flight . The first of these designs to see operation was the supersonic F @-@ 111 fighter @-@ bomber , which used variable @-@ sweep wings for tactical missions . Similar aircraft also emerged for other users as well , notably the BAC TSR @-@ 2 , and later , Panavia Tornado and Sukhoi Su @-@ 24 . A number of studies on a strategic @-@ range counterpart followed . 
 The first post @-@ B @-@ 70 strategic penetrator study was known as the Subsonic Low Altitude Bomber ( <unk> ) , which was completed in 1961 . This produced a design that looked more like an airliner than a bomber , with a large swept wing , T @-@ tail and large high @-@ bypass engines . This was followed by the similar Extended Range Strike Aircraft ( <unk> ) , which added a variable @-@ sweep wing , then in vogue in the aviation industry . <unk> envisioned a relatively small aircraft with a 10 @,@ 000 pounds ( 4 @,@ 500 kg ) payload and a range of 8 @,@ 750 nautical miles ( 16 @,@ 200 kilometres ) , with 2 @,@ 500 nmi ( 4 @,@ 600 km ) being flown at low altitudes . In August 1963 the similar Low @-@ Altitude Manned Penetrator ( LAMP ) design was completed , which called for an aircraft with a 20 @,@ 000 pounds ( 9 @,@ 100 kg ) bomb load and somewhat shorter range of 7 @,@ 150 nmi ( 13 @,@ 240 km ) . 
 These all culminated in the October 1963 Advanced Manned Precision Strike System ( <unk> ) , which led to industry studies at Boeing , General Dynamics , and North American . In mid @-@ 1964 , the USAF had revised its requirements and retitled the project as Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft ( AMSA ) , which differed from <unk> primarily in that it also demanded a high @-@ speed high @-@ altitude capability , similar to that of the existing Mach 2 class Convair B @-@ 58 Hustler . Given the lengthy series of design studies , Rockwell engineers joked that the new name actually stood for " America 's Most Studied Aircraft " . 
 The arguments that led to the cancellation of the B @-@ 70 program had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber of any sort . The U.S. Air Force was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the nuclear triad concept that included bombers , ICBMs , and submarine @-@ launched ballistic missiles ( SLBMs ) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense . They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe counterforce option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked . However , the introduction of the SLBM mooted the mobility and survivability argument , and a newer generation of ICBMs , such as the Minuteman III , had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets . During this time , ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost , but development costs were much higher . Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed . McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964 . 
 Program studies continued ; IBM and Autonetics were awarded AMSA advanced avionics study contracts in 1968 . McNamara remained opposed to the program in favor of upgrading the existing B @-@ 52 fleet and adding nearly 300 FB @-@ 111s for shorter range roles then being filled by the B @-@ 58 . He again vetoed funding for AMSA aircraft development in 1968 . 
 = = = B @-@ 1A program = = = 
 President Richard Nixon reestablished the AMSA program after taking office , keeping with his administration 's flexible response strategy that required a broad range of options short of general nuclear war . Nixon 's Secretary of Defense , Melvin Laird , reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB @-@ 111s , since they lacked the desired range , and recommended that the AMSA design studies be accelerated . In April 1969 , the program officially became the B @-@ 1A . This was the first entry in the new bomber designation series , first created in 1962 . The Air Force issued a request for proposals in November 1969 . 
 Proposals were submitted by Boeing , General Dynamics and North American Rockwell in January 1970 . In June 1970 , North American Rockwell 's design was selected and was awarded a development contract . The original program called for two test airframes , five flyable aircraft , and 40 engines . This was cut in 1971 to one ground and three flight test aircraft . The company changed its name to Rockwell International and named its aircraft division North American Aircraft Operations in 1973 . A fourth prototype , built to production standards , was ordered in the fiscal year 1976 budget . Plans called for 240 B @-@ 1As to be built , with initial operational capability set for 1979 . 
 Rockwell 's design featured a number of features common to 1960s U.S. designs . Among these was the use of a " crew capsule " that ejected as a unit during emergencies , which was introduced to improve survivability in the case of an ejection at high speed . Additionally , the design featured large variable @-@ sweep wings in order to provide both high lift during takeoff and landing , and low drag during a high @-@ speed dash phase . With the wings set to their widest position the aircraft had considerably better lift and power than the B @-@ 52 , allowing it to operate from a much wider variety of bases . Penetration of the Soviet Union 's defenses would take place at supersonic speed , crossing them as quickly as possible before entering into the less defended " heartland " where speeds could be reduced again . The large size and fuel capacity of the design would allow the " dash " portion of the flight to be relatively long . 
 In order to achieve the required Mach 2 performance at high altitudes , the exhaust nozzles and air intake ramps were variable . Initially , it had been expected that a Mach 1 @.@ 2 performance could be achieved at low altitude , which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure . The low altitude performance requirement was later lowered to Mach 0 @.@ 85 , reducing the amount of titanium and therefore cost . A pair of small vanes mounted near the nose are part of an active vibration damping system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low @-@ altitude ride . The first three B @-@ 1As featured an escape capsule that ejected the cockpit with all four crew members inside . The fourth B @-@ 1A was equipped with a conventional ejection seat for each crew member . 
 The B @-@ 1A mockup review occurred in late October 1971 . The first B @-@ 1A prototype ( Air Force serial no . 74 @-@ <unk> ) flew on 23 December 1974 . Three more B @-@ 1A prototypes followed . As the program continued the per @-@ unit cost continued to rise in part because of high inflation during that period . In 1970 , the estimated unit cost was $ 40 million , and by 1975 , this figure had climbed to $ 70 million .

 In 1976 , Soviet pilot Viktor <unk> defected to Japan with his MiG @-@ 25 " <unk> " . During debriefing he described a new " super @-@ <unk> " ( almost certainly referring to the MiG @-@ 31 ) that had look @-@ down / shoot @-@ down radar in order to attack cruise missiles . This would also make any low @-@ level penetration aircraft " visible " and easy to attack . Given that the B @-@ 1 's armament suite was similar to the B @-@ 52 , and it now appeared no more likely to survive Soviet airspace than the B @-@ 52 , the program was increasingly questioned . In particular , Senator William Proxmire continually derided it in public , arguing it was an <unk> expensive dinosaur . During the 1976 federal election campaign , Jimmy Carter made it one of the Democratic Party 's platforms , saying " The B @-@ 1 bomber is an example of a proposed system which should not be funded and would be wasteful of taxpayers ' dollars . " 
 When Carter took office in 1977 he ordered a review of the entire program . By this point the projected cost of the program had risen to over $ 100 million per aircraft , although this was lifetime cost over 20 years . He was informed of the relatively new work on stealth aircraft that had started in 1975 , and he decided that this was a better avenue of approach than the B @-@ 1 . Pentagon officials also stated that the AGM @-@ 86 Air Launched Cruise Missile ( ALCM ) launched from the existing B @-@ 52 fleet would give the USAF equal capability of penetrating Soviet airspace . With a range of 1 @,@ 500 miles ( 2 @,@ 400 km ) , the ALCM could be launched well outside the range of any Soviet defenses and penetrate at low altitude just like a bomber ( and much lower radar cross @-@ section due to size ) , but in much greater numbers at a lower cost . A small number of B @-@ 52s could launch hundreds of ALCMs , saturating the defense . A program to improve the B @-@ 52 and develop and deploy the ALCM would cost perhaps 20 % of the price to deploy the planned 244 B @-@ 1As . 
 On 30 June 1977 , Carter announced that the B @-@ 1A would be canceled in favor of ICBMs , SLBMs , and a fleet of modernized B @-@ 52s armed with ALCMs . Carter called it " one of the most difficult decisions that I 've made since I 've been in office . " No mention of the stealth work was made public with the program being top secret , but today it is known that in early 1978 he authorized the Advanced Technology Bomber ( ATB ) project , which eventually led to the B @-@ 2 Spirit . 
 Domestically , the reaction to the cancellation was split along partisan lines . The Department of Defense was surprised by the announcement ; internal expectations were that the number of B @-@ 1s ordered would be reduced to around 150 . Congressman Robert Dornan ( R @-@ CA ) claimed , " They 're breaking out the vodka and caviar in Moscow . " In contrast , it appears the Soviets were more concerned by large numbers of ALCMs representing a much greater threat than a smaller number of B @-@ 1s . Soviet news agency TASS commented that " the implementation of these militaristic plans has seriously complicated efforts for the limitation of the strategic arms race . " Western military leaders were generally happy with the decision . NATO commander Alexander Haig described the ALCM as an " attractive alternative " to the B @-@ 1 . French General Georges <unk> stated " The B @-@ 1 is a formidable weapon , but not terribly useful . For the price of one bomber , you can have 200 cruise missiles . " 
 Flight tests of the four B @-@ 1A prototypes for the B @-@ 1A program continued through April 1981 . The program included 70 flights totaling 378 hours . A top speed of Mach 2 @.@ 22 was reached by the second B @-@ 1A . Engine testing also continued during this time with the <unk> engines totaling almost 7 @,@ 600 hours .

 It was during this period that the Soviets started to assert themselves in several new theaters of action , in particular through Cuba during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 . U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe . The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines . 
 The U.S. Department of Defense responded by accelerating its Rapid Deployment Forces concept but suffered from major problems with airlift and sealift capability . In order to slow an enemy invasion of other countries , air power was critical ; however the key Iran @-@ Afghanistan border was outside the range of the U.S. Navy 's carrier @-@ based attack aircraft , leaving this role to the U.S. Air Force . Although the B @-@ 52 had the range to support on @-@ demand global missions , its long runway requirements limited the forward basing possibilities . 
 During the 1980 presidential campaign , Ronald Reagan campaigned heavily on the platform that Carter was weak on defense , citing the cancellation of the B @-@ 1 program as an example , a theme he continued using into the 1980s . During this time Carter 's defense secretary , Harold Brown , announced the stealth bomber project , apparently implying that this was the reason for the B @-@ 1 cancellation . 
 = = = B @-@ 1B program = = = 
 On taking office , Reagan was faced with the same decision as Carter before : whether to continue with the B @-@ 1 for the short term , or to wait for the development of the ATB , a much more advanced aircraft . Studies suggested that the existing B @-@ 52 fleet with ALCM would remain a credible threat until 1985 , as it was predicted that 75 % of the B @-@ 52 force would survive to attack its targets . After this , the introduction of the SA @-@ 10 missile , the MiG @-@ 31 interceptor and the first Soviet Airborne Early Warning and Control ( AWACS ) systems would make the B @-@ 52 increasingly vulnerable . During 1981 , funds were allocated to a new study for a bomber for the 1990s time @-@ frame . This led to the Long @-@ Range Combat Aircraft ( LRCA ) project . The LRCA evaluated the B @-@ 1 , F @-@ 111 and ATB as possible solutions ; an emphasis was placed on multi @-@ role capabilities , as opposed to purely strategic operations . 
 In 1981 , it was believed the B @-@ 1 could be in operation before the ATB , covering the transitional period between the B @-@ 52 's increasing vulnerability and the ATB 's introduction . Reagan decided the best solution was to procure both the B @-@ 1 and ATB , and on 2 October 1981 Reagan announced that 100 B @-@ 1s were to be ordered to fill the LRCA role . 
 In January 1982 the U.S. Air Force awarded two contracts to Rockwell worth a combined $ 2 @.@ 2 billion for the development and production of 100 new B @-@ 1 bombers . Numerous changes were made to the design to make it better suited to the now expected missions , resulting in the new B @-@ 1B . These changes included a reduction in maximum speed , which allowed the variable @-@ aspect intake ramps to be replaced by simpler fixed geometry intake ramps in the newer design . This reduced the B version 's radar signature ; the reduction in radar cross @-@ section was seen as a good trade off for the speed decrease . High subsonic speeds at low altitude became a focus area for the revised design , and low @-@ level speeds were increased from about Mach 0 @.@ 85 to 0 @.@ 92 . The B @-@ 1B has a maximum speed of Mach 1 @.@ 25 at higher altitudes . 
 The B @-@ 1B 's maximum takeoff weight was increased to 477 @,@ 000 pounds ( 216 @,@ 000 kg ) from the B @-@ 1A 's 395 @,@ 000 pounds ( 179 @,@ 000 kg ) . The weight increase was to allow for takeoff with a full internal fuel load and for external weapons to be carried . Rockwell engineers were able to reinforce critical areas and lighten non @-@ critical areas of the airframe , so the increase in empty weight was minimal . In order to deal with the introduction of the MiG @-@ 31 equipped with the new <unk> radar system , and other aircraft with look @-@ down capability ( which reduced the B @-@ 1s low @-@ flying advantage ) , the B @-@ 1B 's electronic warfare suite was significantly upgraded . 
 Opposition to the plan was widespread within Congress . Critics pointed out that many of the original problems remained in both areas of performance and expense . In particular it seemed the B @-@ 52 fitted with electronics similar to the B @-@ 1B would be equally able to avoid interception , as the speed advantage of the B @-@ 1 was now minimal . It also appeared that the " interim " time frame served by the B @-@ 1B would be less than a decade , being rendered obsolete shortly after the introduction of a much more capable ATB design . The primary argument in favor of the B @-@ 1 was its large conventional weapon payload , and that its takeoff performance allowed it to operate with a credible bombload from a much wider variety of airfields . The USAF spread production subcontracts across many congressional districts , making the aircraft more popular on Capitol Hill . 
 B @-@ 1A # 1 was disassembled and used for radar testing at the Rome Air Development Center at the former Griffiss Air Force Base , New York . B @-@ 1As # 2 and # 4 were modified to include B @-@ 1B systems . The first B @-@ 1B was completed and began flight testing in March 1983 . The first production B @-@ 1B was rolled out on 4 September 1984 and first flew on 18 October 1984 . The 100th and final B @-@ 1B was delivered on 2 May 1988 ; before the last B @-@ 1B was delivered , the USAF had determined that the aircraft was vulnerable to Soviet air defenses .

 = = = Overview = = = 
 The B @-@ 1 has a blended wing body configuration , with variable @-@ sweep wing , four turbofan engines , triangular fin control surfaces and cruciform tail . The wings can sweep from 15 degrees to 67 @.@ 5 degrees ( full forward to full sweep ) . Forward @-@ swept wing settings are used for takeoff , landings and high @-@ altitude maximum cruise . Aft @-@ swept wing settings are used in high subsonic and supersonic flight . The B @-@ 1 's variable @-@ sweep wings and thrust @-@ to @-@ weight ratio provide it with better takeoff performance , allowing it to use more runways than previous bombers . The length of the aircraft presented a flexing problem due to air turbulence at low altitude . To alleviate this , Rockwell included small triangular fin control surfaces or vanes near the nose on the B @-@ 1 . The B @-@ 1 's Structural Mode Control System rotates the vanes automatically to counteract turbulence and smooth out the ride . 
 Unlike the B @-@ 1A , the B @-@ 1B cannot reach Mach 2 + speeds ; its maximum speed is Mach 1 @.@ 25 ( about 950 mph or 1 @,@ 530 km / h at altitude ) , but its low @-@ level speed increased to Mach 0 @.@ 92 ( 700 mph , 1 @,@ 130 km / h ) . The speed of the current version of the aircraft is limited by the need to avoid damage to its structure and air intakes . To help lower its radar cross section ( RCS ) , the B @-@ 1B uses serpentine air intake ducts ( see S @-@ duct ) and fixed intake ramps , which limit its speed compared to the B @-@ 1A . Vanes in the intake ducts serve to deflect and shield radar emissions from the highly reflective engine compressor blades . 
 The B @-@ 1A 's engine was modified slightly to produce the GE F101 @-@ 102 for the B @-@ 1B , with an emphasis on durability , and increased efficiency . The core of this engine has since been re @-@ used in several other engine designs , including the GE F110 which has seen use in the F @-@ 14 Tomcat , F @-@ 15K / SG variants and most recent versions of the General Dynamics F @-@ 16 Fighting Falcon . It is also the basis for the non @-@ afterburning GE <unk> used in the B @-@ 2 Spirit and the U @-@ 2S . The F101 engine was the basis for the core of the extremely popular CFM56 civil engine , which can be found on some versions of practically every small @-@ to @-@ medium @-@ sized airliner . The nose gear cover door has controls for the auxiliary power units ( <unk> ) , which allow for quick starts of the <unk> upon order to scramble . 
 = = = Avionics = = = 
 The B @-@ 1 's main computer is the IBM AP @-@ 101 , which is also used on the Space Shuttle orbiter and the B @-@ 52 bomber . The computer is programmed with the <unk> programming language . The Lancer 's offensive avionics include the Westinghouse ( now Northrop Grumman ) AN / APQ @-@ 164 forward @-@ looking offensive passive electronically scanned array radar set with electronic beam steering ( and a fixed antenna pointed downward for reduced radar observability ) , synthetic aperture radar , ground moving target indication ( <unk> ) , and terrain @-@ following radar modes , Doppler navigation , radar altimeter , and an inertial navigation suite . The B @-@ 1B Block D upgrade added a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) receiver beginning in 1995 . 
 The B @-@ 1 's defensive electronics include the Eaton AN / ALQ @-@ <unk> radar warning and defensive jamming equipment , which has three sets of antennas ; one at the front base of each wing and the third rear @-@ facing in the tail radome . Also in the tail radome is the AN / ALQ @-@ 153 Missile Approach Warning ( Pulse @-@ Doppler radar ) . The ALQ @-@ 161 is linked to a total of eight AN / ALE @-@ 49 flare dispensers located on top behind the canopy , which are handled by the AN / ASQ @-@ 184 avionics management system . Each AN / ALE @-@ 49 dispenser has a capacity of 12 MJU @-@ 23A / B flares . The MJU @-@ 23A / B flare is one of the world 's largest infrared countermeasure flares at a weight of over 3 @.@ 3 pounds ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) . The B @-@ 1 has also been equipped to carry the ALE @-@ 50 Towed Decoy System . 
 Also aiding the B @-@ 1 's survivability is its relatively low radar cross @-@ section ( RCS ) . Although not technically a stealth aircraft in a comprehensive sense , thanks to the aircraft 's structure , serpentine intake paths and use of radar @-@ absorbent material its RCS is about 1 / 50th of the similar sized B @-@ 52 's RCS ; this is about 26 ft ² or 2 @.@ 4 m ² , roughly equivalent to the RCS of a small fighter aircraft . 
 = = = Upgrades = = = 
 The B @-@ 1 has been upgraded since production , beginning with the " Conventional Mission Upgrade Program " ( <unk> ) , which added a new MIL @-@ STD @-@ 1760 smart @-@ weapons interface to enable the use of precision @-@ guided conventional weapons . <unk> began with Block A , which was the standard B @-@ 1B with the capability to deliver non @-@ precision gravity bombs . Block B brought an improved Synthetic Aperture Radar , and upgrades to the Defensive Countermeasures System and was fielded in 1995 . Block C provided an " enhanced capability " for delivery of up to 30 cluster bomb units ( CBUs ) per sortie with modifications made to 50 bomb racks . 
 Block D added a " Near Precision Capability " via improved weapons and targeting systems , and added advanced secure communications capabilities . The first part of the electronic countermeasures upgrade added Joint Direct Attack Munition ( JDAM ) , ALE @-@ 50 Towed Decoy System , and anti @-@ jam radios . Block E upgraded the avionics computers and incorporated the Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser ( WCMD ) , the AGM @-@ 154 Joint Standoff Weapon ( JSOW ) and the AGM @-@ 158 JASSM ( Joint Air to Surface Standoff Munition ) , substantially improving the bomber 's capability . Upgrades were completed in September 2006 . Block F was the Defensive Systems Upgrade Program ( <unk> ) to improve the aircraft 's electronic countermeasures and jamming capabilities , but it was canceled in December 2002 due to cost overruns and schedule slips . 
 In 2005 , a program began to upgrade crew stations and integrate data linking . A B @-@ 1 equipped with the Fully Integrated Data Link ( <unk> ) first flew on 29 July 2009 ; the <unk> enables electronic data sharing , eliminating the need to enter information between systems by hand . In January 2013 , Boeing delivered the first Integrated Battle Station ( IBS ) equipped B @-@ 1 . This replaced several displays with new multi @-@ function color display units , an upgraded Central Integrated Test System , and a newer Aircraft Performance Monitoring Computer . In June 2012 , the B @-@ 1Bs are receiving Sustainment @-@ Block 16 upgrades to add Link 16 networking and digital flight instrumentation . 
 In 2007 , the Sniper XR targeting pod was integrated on the B @-@ 1 fleet . The pod is mounted on an external hardpoint at the aircraft 's chin near the forward bomb bay . Following accelerated testing , the Sniper pod was fielded in summer 2008 . Future precision munitions include the Small Diameter Bomb . In 2011 , the Air Force was considering upgrading the B @-@ 1s with multiple ejector racks so that they can carry three times as many smaller JDAMs than they currently can . 
 In February 2014 , work began on a multi @-@ year upgrade of 62 B @-@ 1Bs , scheduled to be completed by 2019 . The vertical situation display upgrade ( <unk> ) shall replace existing flight instruments with multifunction color displays , a second display shall aid threat evasion and targeting , and act as a back @-@ up display . Additional memory capacity is to be installed for the diagnostics database . Procurement and installation of the IBS upgrades is expected to cost $ 918 million , research and engineering costs are estimated at $ 391 million . Other additions are to replace the two spinning mass gyroscopic inertial navigation system with ring laser gyroscopic systems and a GPS antenna , replacement of the APQ @-@ 164 radar with the Scalable Agile Beam Radar - Global Strike ( SABR @-@ GS ) active electronically scanned array , and a new attitude indicator .

 The second B @-@ 1B , " The Star of Abilene " , was the first B @-@ 1B delivered to the USAF Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) in June 1985 . Initial operational capability was reached on 1 October 1986 and the B @-@ 1B was placed on nuclear alert status . The B @-@ 1 received the official name " Lancer " on 15 March 1990 . However , the bomber has been commonly called the " Bone " ; a nickname that appears to stem from an early newspaper article on the aircraft wherein its name was phonetically spelled out as " B @-@ ONE " with the hyphen inadvertently omitted . 
 In late 1990 , engine fires in two Lancers led to a grounding of the fleet . The cause was traced back to problems in the first @-@ stage fan , the aircraft were placed on " limited alert " ; in other words , they were grounded unless a nuclear war broke out . Following inspections and repairs they were returned to duty beginning on 6 February 1991 . By 1991 , the B @-@ 1 had a fledgling conventional capability , forty of them able to drop the 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) Mk @-@ 82 General Purpose ( GP ) bomb , although mostly from low altitude . Despite being cleared for this role , the problems with the engines prevented their use in Operation Desert Storm during the Gulf War . B @-@ 1s were primarily reserved for strategic nuclear strike missions at this time , providing the role of airborne nuclear deterrent against the Soviet Union . The B @-@ 52 was more suited to the role of conventional warfare and it was used by coalition forces instead . 
 Originally designed strictly for nuclear war , the B @-@ 1 's development as an effective conventional bomber was delayed . The collapse of the Soviet Union had brought the B @-@ 1 's nuclear role into question , leading to President George H. W. Bush ordering a $ 3 billion conventional refit . After the inactivation of Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) and the establishment of the Air Combat Command ( ACC ) in 1992 , the B @-@ 1 developed a greater conventional weapons capability . Part of this development was the start @-@ up of the U.S. Air Force Weapons School B @-@ 1 Division . In 1994 , two additional B @-@ 1 bomb wings were also created in the Air National Guard , with former fighter wings in the Kansas Air National Guard and the Georgia Air National Guard converting to the aircraft . By the mid @-@ 1990s , the B @-@ 1 could employ GP weapons as well as various CBUs . By the end of the 1990s , with the advent of the " Block D " upgrade , the B @-@ 1 boasted a full array of guided and unguided munitions . The B @-@ 1B no longer carries nuclear weapons ; its nuclear capability was disabled by 1995 with the removal of nuclear arming and fuzing hardware . 
 = = = Conventional role = = = 
 The B @-@ 1 was first used in combat in support of operations against Iraq , during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998 , employing unguided GP weapons . B @-@ 1s have been subsequently used in Operation Allied Force ( Kosovo ) and , most notably , in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq . The B @-@ 1 's role in Operation Allied Force has been criticized as the aircraft was not used until after enemy defenses had been suppressed by aircraft like the older B @-@ 52 it was intended to replace . The B @-@ 1 has deployed an array of conventional weapons in war zones , most notably the GBU @-@ 31 , 2 @,@ 000 pounds ( 910 kg ) Joint Direct Attack Munition ( JDAM ) . In the first six months of Operation Enduring Freedom , eight B @-@ 1s dropped almost 40 percent of aerial ordnance , including some 3 @,@ 900 JDAMs . JDAM munitions were heavily used by the B @-@ 1 over Iraq , notably on 7 April 2003 in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Saddam Hussein and his two sons . At the height of the Iraq War , a B @-@ 1 was permanently airborne to provide rapid precision bombardment upon important targets as intelligence identified them . During Operation Enduring Freedom , the B @-@ 1 was able to raise its mission capable rate to 79 % . 
 The B @-@ 1 has higher survivability and speed when compared to the older B @-@ 52 , which it was intended to replace . It also holds 61 FAI world records for speed , payload , distance , and time @-@ to @-@ climb in different aircraft weight classes . In November 1983 , three B @-@ 1Bs set a long distance record for the aircraft , which demonstrated its ability to conduct extended mission lengths to strike anywhere in the world and return to base without any stops . The National Aeronautic Association recognized the B @-@ 1B for completing one of the 10 most memorable record flights for 1994 . 
 Of the 100 B @-@ 1Bs built , 93 remained in 2000 after losses in accidents . In June 2001 , the Pentagon sought to place one @-@ third of its then fleet into storage ; this proposal resulted in several U.S. Air National Guard officers and members of Congress lobbying against the proposal , including the drafting of an amendment to prevent such cuts . The 2001 proposal was intended to allow money to be diverted to further upgrades to the remaining B @-@ 1Bs , such as computer modernization . In 2003 , accompanied by the removal of B @-@ 1Bs from the two bomb wings in the Air National Guard , the USAF decided to retire 33 aircraft to concentrate its budget on maintaining availability of remaining B @-@ 1Bs . In 2004 , a new appropriation bill called for some of the retired aircraft to return to service , and the USAF returned seven mothballed bombers to service to increase the fleet to 67 aircraft . 
 On 14 July 2007 , the Associated Press reported on the growing USAF presence in Iraq , including reintroduction of B @-@ 1Bs as a close @-@ at @-@ hand platform to support Coalition ground forces . Since 2008 , B @-@ 1s have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan in an " armed overwatch " role , loitering for surveillance purposes while ready to deliver guided bombs in support of ground troops if contacted . 
 The B @-@ 1B underwent a series of flight tests using a 50 / 50 mix of synthetic and petroleum fuel ; on 19 March 2008 , a B @-@ 1B from Dyess Air Force Base , Texas , became the first USAF aircraft to fly at supersonic speed using a synthetic fuel during a flight over Texas and New Mexico . This was conducted as part of an ongoing Air Force testing and certification program to reduce reliance on traditional oil sources . On 4 August 2008 , a B @-@ 1B flew the first Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod equipped combat sortie where the crew successfully targeted enemy ground forces and dropped a GBU @-@ 38 guided bomb in Afghanistan . 
 In March 2011 , B @-@ 1Bs from Ellsworth Air Force Base attacked undisclosed targets in Libya as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn . The USAF had 66 B @-@ 1Bs in service in September 2012 , split among four squadrons organized into two Bomb Wings : the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess AFB , Texas , and the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth AFB , South Dakota . 
 With upgrades to keep the B @-@ 1 viable , the air force may keep it in service until approximately 2038 . Despite upgrades , the B @-@ 1 has repair and cost issues ; every flight hour needs 48 @.@ 4 hours of repair . The fuel , repairs and other needs for a 12 @-@ hour mission costs $ 720 @,@ 000 as of 2010 . The $ 63 @,@ 000 cost per flight hour is , however , less than the $ 72 @,@ 000 for the B @-@ 52 and the $ 135 @,@ 000 of the B @-@ 2 . In June 2010 , senior USAF officials met to consider retiring the entire fleet to meet budget cuts . The Pentagon plans to supplement the aircraft with the Long Range Strike Bomber beginning in 2030 . In the meantime , its " capabilities are particularly well @-@ suited to the vast distances and unique challenges of the Pacific region , and we 'll continue to invest in , and rely on , the B @-@ 1 in support of the focus on the Pacific " as part of President Obama 's " Pivot to East Asia " . 
 In August 2012 , the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron returned from a six @-@ month tour in Afghanistan . Their nine B @-@ 1Bs flew 770 sorties , the most of any B @-@ 1B squadron on a single deployment . The squadron spent 9 @,@ 500 hours airborne , having one of its bombers in the air at all times . They accounted for a quarter of all combat aircraft sorties over the country while there and averaged 2 – 3 requests for air support per day . On 4 September 2013 , a B @-@ 1B participated in a maritime evaluation exercise , deploying munitions such as laser @-@ guided 500 lb GBU @-@ 54 bombs , 500 lb and 2 @,@ 000 lb Joint Direct Attack Munitions ( JDAM ) , and Long Range Anti @-@ Ship Missiles ( <unk> ) . The aim was to detect and engage several small craft using existing weapons and tactics developed from conventional warfare against ground targets ; the B @-@ 1 is seen as a useful asset for maritime duties such as patrolling shipping lanes . 
 Beginning in 2014 , the B @-@ 1 was used by the U.S. against the Islamic State ( IS ) in the Syrian Civil War . From August 2014 to January 2015 , the B @-@ 1 accounted for eight percent of USAF sorties during Operation Inherent Resolve . The 9th Bomb Squadron was deployed to Qatar in July 2014 for support of missions for Afghanistan , but when the air campaign against IS began on 8 August , the unit 's B @-@ 1 's were redirected to Iraq . During the Battle of <unk> in Syria , the squadron 's B @-@ 1s dropped 660 bombs over five months in support of Kurdish forces defending the city , one @-@ third of all bombs used during <unk> during the period , killing some 1 @,@ 000 ISIL fighters .

 B @-@ 1A 
 The B @-@ 1A was the original B @-@ 1 design with variable engine intakes and Mach 2 @.@ 2 top speed . Four prototypes were built ; no production units were manufactured . 
 B @-@ 1B 
 The B @-@ 1B is a revised B @-@ 1 design with reduced radar signature and a top speed of Mach 1 @.@ 25 . It was otherwise optimized for low @-@ level penetration . A total of 100 B @-@ 1Bs were produced . 
 B @-@ 1R 
 The B @-@ 1R is a proposed upgrade of existing B @-@ 1B aircraft . The B @-@ 1R ( R for " regional " ) would be fitted with advanced radars , air @-@ to @-@ air missiles , and new Pratt & Whitney F119 engines . This variant would have a top speed of Mach 2 @.@ 2 , but with 20 % shorter range . 
 Existing external hardpoints would be modified to allow multiple conventional weapons to be carried , increasing overall loadout . For air @-@ to @-@ air defense , an Active electronically scanned array ( AESA ) radar would be added and some existing hardpoints modified to carry air @-@ to @-@ air missiles . If needed the B @-@ 1R could escape from unfavorable air @-@ to @-@ air encounters with its Mach 2 + speed . Few aircraft are currently capable of sustained speeds over Mach 2 .

 On 29 August 1984 , B @-@ 1A ( AF Ser . No. 74 @-@ <unk> ) stalled and crashed while performing minimum control speed tests at low altitude . The crew used the escape capsule to leave the bomber , but the parachutes deployed improperly , causing the capsule to hit nose down . The impact killed the B @-@ 1 's pilot , Rockwell test pilot Doug <unk> , and seriously injured two other crew members . 
 In September 1987 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 84 @-@ 0052 ) from the 96th Bomb Wing , 338th Combat Crew Training Squadron , Dyess AFB crashed near La Junta , Colorado while flying on a low @-@ level training route . This was the only B @-@ 1B crash to occur with six crew members aboard . The two crew members in jump seats , and one of the four crew members in ejection seats perished . The root cause of the accident was thought to be a bird strike on a wing 's leading edge during the low @-@ level flight . The impact was severe enough to sever fuel and hydraulic lines on one side of the aircraft , the other side 's engines functioned long enough to allow for ejection . The B @-@ 1B fleet was later modified to protect these supply lines . 
 In November 1988 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 85 @-@ 0063 ) from the 96th Bomb Wing , 337th Bomb Squadron , Dyess AFB crashed near Tye , Texas after a fire broke out above the left engines . All four crew members successfully ejected from the aircraft . 
 In November 1988 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 85 @-@ <unk> ) from the 28th Bomb Wing , 37th Bomb Squadron , Ellsworth AFB crashed short of the runway at Ellsworth AFB during adverse weather . All four crew members ejected successfully . 
 In November 1992 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 86 @-@ <unk> ) from the 7th Bomb Wing , 337th Bomb Squadron , Dyess AFB , Texas , flying on a low @-@ level training flight crashed into a mountain near Van Horn , Texas . All four members of the crew were killed , and the cause was attributed to pilot error . 
 In September 1997 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 85 @-@ <unk> ) from the 28th Bomb Wing , 37th Bomb Squadron , Ellsworth AFB , South Dakota , flying in the Powder River Military Operating Area crashed 25 miles ( 40 km ) north of <unk> , Montana . All four members of the crew were killed . The review board found that the bomber struck the ground due to pilot error , while performing a defensive maneuver during training . 
 On 18 February 1998 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 84 @-@ 0057 ) from the 7th Bomb Wing , Dyess AFB , Texas crashed near Marion , Kentucky when a fire detected by a cockpit instrument panel shut down the aircraft 's power . All four crew members were able to eject and were rescued safely . 
 In December 2001 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 86 @-@ <unk> ) from the 28th Bomb Wing , 37th Bomb Squadron , Ellsworth AFB , South Dakota , was lost over the Indian Ocean . All four crew members successfully ejected and were rescued . The bomber was flying en route to a long @-@ range combat mission over Afghanistan when the crew declared an in @-@ flight emergency . The pilot , Captain William Steele , attributed the crash to " multiple malfunctions " causing the bomber to go " out of control " . Because of the water 's depth , the structural data collector ( <unk> ) or " Black Box " was not recovered and the cause was not positively determined . The aircraft had recently returned from a routine Phase Inspection , and was on its first combat mission after returning to the island of Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territory . This was the first B @-@ 1B to be lost during combat operations . 
 On 4 April 2008 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 86 @-@ <unk> ) lost hydraulic power while taxiing , then crashed into a concrete barrier and caught fire at Al Udeid AB , Qatar . The crew safely evacuated the aircraft . The B @-@ 1B was carrying two 2 @,@ 000 lb bombs at the time , which did not detonate . The aircraft was destroyed . 
 On 19 August 2013 , B @-@ 1B ( AF Ser . No. 85 @-@ <unk> ) out of Ellsworth AFB , South Dakota crashed in a remote area near Broadus , Montana . All four crew members survived by ejecting before the aircraft crashed . A report found that the crash was due to a mechanical failure leading to a fuel leak and explosions .

 On 4 October 1989 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 85 @-@ 0070 ) from the 96th Bomb Wing , 337th Bomb Squadron , Dyess AFB , Texas , was forced to make an emergency landing at Edwards Air Force Base after suffering an in @-@ flight failure of the No. 2 hydraulic system , which required use of the No 3 system to deploy the landing gear . After the nose gear failed to deploy , the crew attempted to lower the nose gear via the alternate emergency gear @-@ extension method . After several hours of attempting different means to lower the nose gear , the decision was made to perform a nose @-@ gear @-@ up landing on Rogers Dry Lake at Edwards . The lower portion of the forward bulkhead used to mount the radar antenna was the only part of the aircraft to suffer damage , and after repairs , the jet was returned to Dyess in January 1990 by the same crew which performed the emergency landing . 
 In October 1990 , while flying a training route in eastern Colorado , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 86 @-@ <unk> ) from the 384th Bomb Wing , 28th Bomb Squadron , McConnell AFB , experienced an explosion as the engines reached full power without afterburners . Fire on the aircraft 's left was spotted . The # 1 engine was shut down and its fire extinguisher was activated . The accident investigation determined that the engine had suffered catastrophic failure , engine blades had cut through the engine mounts and the engine became detached from the aircraft . 
 In December 1990 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 83 @-@ 0071 ) from the 96th Bomb Wing , 337th Bomb Squadron , Dyess AFB , Texas , experienced a jolt that caused the # 3 engine to shut down with its fire extinguisher activating . This event , coupled with the October 1990 engine incident , led to a 50 + day grounding of the B @-@ 1Bs not on nuclear alert status . The problem was eventually traced back to problems in the first @-@ stage fan , and all B @-@ 1Bs were equipped with modified engines . 
 In June 1994 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 84 @-@ 0057 ) from the 7th Bomb Wing , 9th Bomb Squadron , made an emergency divert to Rhein @-@ Main Air Base , Germany due to a wing sweep malfunction . The crew made a high speed landing at Rhein @-@ Main and stopped 100 feet short of the end of the runway . Afterward the overheated brakes led to a fire in the right main landing gear , but it was quickly extinguished . 
 On 15 September 2005 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 85 @-@ 0066 ) was extensively damaged by fire while landing at Andersen Air Force Base , Guam . The investigation into the incident concluded that leaking hydraulic fluid and sparks from a wheel being gouged caused a fire to start in the aircraft 's right main landing gear as it touched down . The resulting fire damaged the B @-@ 1 's right wing , engine nacelle , airframe and landing gear , leading to an estimated repair cost of more than $ 32 million . 
 On 8 May 2006 , B @-@ 1B ( s / n 86 @-@ <unk> ) from the 7th Bomb Wing , 9th Bomb Squadron , Dyess AFB , Texas , landed " gear @-@ up " during recovery from an 11 @-@ hour ferry flight to the island of Diego Garcia . A resulting fire was quickly extinguished and the crew escaped through the top hatch with only a minor back injury to the co @-@ pilot . The air force investigation concluded that the crew " forgot to lower the landing gear " based on the following reasons : 1 ) co @-@ pilot task oversaturation , 2 ) co @-@ pilot 's wanting to complete a long mission , 3 ) neither pilot completed the landing checklist , 4 ) co @-@ pilot 's belief that the pilot had lowered the landing gear when he had not , 5 ) pilot had turned over control to the co @-@ pilot on the final approach and the pilot had reported to base that the landing gear was down when it was not - indicator lights showing the landing gear was still up were working and apparently ignored . As a result , the B @-@ 1B impacted and slid on the runway , which caused approximately $ 8 million of damage to the aircraft and runway .

 = Tantalum = 
 Tantalum is a chemical element with symbol Ta and atomic number 73 . Previously known as <unk> , its name comes from Tantalus , a villain from Greek mythology . Tantalum is a rare , hard , blue @-@ gray , lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion @-@ resistant . It is part of the refractory metals group , which are widely used as minor components in alloys . The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum . Its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones , DVD players , video game systems and computers . Tantalum , always together with the chemically similar niobium , occurs in the minerals tantalite , columbite and coltan ( a mix of columbite and tantalite ) . 
 = = History = = 
 Tantalum was discovered in Sweden in 1802 by Anders Ekeberg . One year earlier , Charles Hatchett had discovered the element columbium . In 1809 , the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium — columbite , with a density 5 @.@ 918 g / cm3 , and tantalum — tantalite , with a density 7 @.@ 935 g / cm3 , and concluded that the two oxides , despite their difference in measured density , were identical . He decided to keep the name tantalum . After Friedrich Wöhler confirmed these results , it was thought that columbium and tantalum were the same element . This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by the German chemist Heinrich Rose , who argued that there were two additional elements in the tantalite sample , and he named them after the children of Tantalus : niobium ( from Niobe , the goddess of tears ) , and pelopium ( from Pelops ) . The supposed element " pelopium " was later identified as a mixture of tantalum and niobium , and it was found that the niobium was identical to the columbium already discovered in 1801 by Hatchett . 
 The differences between tantalum and niobium were demonstrated unequivocally in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm <unk> , and Henri Etienne Sainte @-@ Claire Deville , as well as by Louis J. Troost , who determined the empirical formulas of some of their compounds in 1865 . Further confirmation came from the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac , in 1866 , who proved that there were only two elements . These discoveries did not stop scientists from publishing articles about the so @-@ called ilmenium until 1871 . De Marignac was the first to produce the metallic form of tantalum in 1864 , when he reduced tantalum chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen . Early investigators had only been able to produce impure tantalum , and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by Werner von Bolton in Charlottenburg in 1903 . Wires made with metallic tantalum were used for light bulb filaments until tungsten replaced it in widespread use . 
 The name tantalum was derived from the name of the mythological Tantalus , the father of Niobe in Greek mythology . In the story , he had been punished after death by being condemned to stand knee @-@ deep in water with perfect fruit growing above his head , both of which eternally tantalized him . ( If he bent to drink the water , it drained below the level he could reach , and if he reached for the fruit , the branches moved out of his grasp . ) Ekeberg wrote " This metal I call tantalum ... partly in allusion to its incapacity , when immersed in acid , to absorb any and be saturated . " 
 For decades , the commercial technology for separating tantalum from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium <unk> monohydrate , a process that was discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866 . This method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride @-@ containing solutions of tantalum . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Physical properties = = = 
 Tantalum is dark ( blue @-@ gray ) , dense , ductile , very hard , easily fabricated , and highly conductive of heat and electricity . The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids ; in fact , at temperatures below 150 ° C tantalum is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia . It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide , as well as with a solution of potassium hydroxide . Tantalum 's high melting point of <unk> ° C ( boiling point <unk> ° C ) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten , rhenium and osmium for metals , and carbon . 
 Tantalum exists in two crystalline phases , alpha and beta . The alpha phase is relatively ductile and soft ; it has body @-@ centered cubic structure ( space group <unk> , lattice constant a 
 = 0 @.@ <unk> nm ) , Knoop hardness 200 – 400 HN and electrical resistivity 15 – 60 <unk> . The beta phase is hard and brittle ; its crystal symmetry is tetragonal ( space group <unk> / <unk> , a = 
 1 @.@ <unk> nm , c = 0 @.@ <unk> nm ) , Knoop hardness is 1000 – 1300 HN and electrical resistivity is relatively high at 170 – 210 <unk> . The beta phase is metastable and converts to the alpha phase upon heating to 750 – 775 ° C. Bulk tantalum is almost entirely alpha phase , and the beta phase usually exists as thin films obtained by magnetron sputtering , chemical vapor deposition or electrochemical deposition from an eutectic molten salt solution . 
 = = = Chemical properties = = = 
 Tantalum forms oxides with the oxidation states + 5 ( Ta2O5 ) and + 4 ( <unk> ) . The most stable oxidation state is + 5 , as seen in tantalum pentoxide . Tantalum pentoxide is the starting material for several tantalum compounds . The compounds are created by dissolving the pentoxide in basic hydroxide solutions or by melting it in another metal oxide . Such examples are lithium tantalate ( <unk> ) and lanthanum tantalate ( <unk> ) . In the lithium tantalate , the tantalate ion <unk> − 
 3 does not occur ; instead , this part of the formula represents linkage of <unk> − 
 6 octahedra to form a three @-@ dimensional perovskite framework ; while the lanthanum tantalate contains lone <unk> − 
 4 tetrahedral groups . 
 The fluorides of tantalum can be used for its separation from niobium . Tantalum forms halogen compounds in the oxidation states of + 5 , + 4 , and + 3 of the type TaX 
 5 , TaX 
 4 , and TaX 
 3 , although multi @-@ core complexes and <unk> compounds are also known . Tantalum pentafluoride ( <unk> ) is a white solid with a melting point of 97 @.@ 0 ° C and tantalum pentachloride ( <unk> ) is a white solid with a melting point of 247 @.@ 4 ° C. Tantalum pentachloride is hydrolyzed by water and reacts with additional tantalum at elevated temperatures by forming the black and highly hygroscopic tantalum tetrachloride ( <unk> ) . While the trihalides can be obtained by reduction of the pentahalides with hydrogen , the dihalides do not exist . A tantalum @-@ tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals . Tantalum compounds with oxidation states as low as − 1 have been reported in 2008 . As in the cases of most other refractory metals , the hardest known compounds of tantalum are its stable nitrides and carbides . Tantalum carbide , <unk> , like the more commonly used tungsten carbide , is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools . Tantalum ( III ) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes . Chemists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States have developed a tantalum carbide @-@ graphite composite material that is one of the hardest materials ever synthesized . Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum @-@ tungsten @-@ copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys . There are two tantalum <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . These are stable , refractory , and reflective , and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Natural tantalum consists of two isotopes : 180mTa ( 0 @.@ 012 % ) and 181Ta ( 99 @.@ 988 % ) . 181Ta is a stable isotope . 180mTa ( m denotes a metastable state ) is predicted to decay in three ways : isomeric transition to the ground state of <unk> , beta decay to 180W , or electron capture to <unk> . However , radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed , and only a lower limit on its half life of 2 @.@ 0 × 1016 years has been set . The ground state of <unk> has a half life of only 8 hours . 180mTa is the only naturally occurring nuclear isomer ( excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short @-@ living nuclides ) . It is also the rarest isotope in the Universe , taking into account the elemental abundance of tantalum and isotopic abundance of 180mTa in the natural mixture of isotopes ( and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short @-@ living nuclides ) . 
 Tantalum has been examined theoretically as a " salting " material for nuclear weapons ( cobalt is the better @-@ known hypothetical salting material ) . An external shell of 181Ta would be irradiated by the intensive high @-@ energy neutron flux from a hypothetical exploding nuclear weapon . This would transmute the tantalum into the radioactive isotope <unk> , which has a half @-@ life of 114 @.@ 4 days and produces gamma rays with approximately 1 @.@ 12 million electron @-@ volts ( MeV ) of energy apiece , which would significantly increase the radioactivity of the nuclear fallout from the explosion for several months . Such " salted " weapons have never been built or tested , as far as is publicly known , and certainly never used as weapons . 
 Tantalum can be used as a target material for accelerated proton beams for the production of various short @-@ lived isotopes including <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 = = = Occurrence = = = 
 Tantalum is estimated to make up about 1 ppm or 2 ppm of the Earth 's crust by weight . There are many species of tantalum minerals , only some of which are so far being used by industry as raw materials : tantalite , <unk> , <unk> , euxenite , <unk> . <unk> ( Fe , Mn ) <unk> is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction . <unk> has the same mineral structure as columbite ( Fe , Mn ) ( Ta , Nb ) 2O6 ; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite ( or <unk> ) . The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method . Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite . 
 The primary mining of tantalum is in Australia , where the largest producer , Global Advanced Metals , formerly known as <unk> Minerals , operates two mines in Western Australia , <unk> in the Southwest and Wodgina in the Pilbara region . The Wodgina mine was reopened in January 2011 after mining at the site was suspended in late @-@ 2008 due to the global financial crisis . Less than a year after it reopened , Global Advanced Metals announced that due to again " ... softening tantalum demand ... " , and other factors , tantalum mining operations were to cease at the end of February 2012 . Wodgina produces a primary tantalum concentrate which is further upgraded at the <unk> operation before being sold to customers . Whereas the large @-@ scale producers of niobium are in Brazil and Canada , the ore there also yields a small percentage of tantalum . Some other countries such as China , Ethiopia , and Mozambique mine ores with a higher percentage of tantalum , and they produce a significant percentage of the world 's output of it . Tantalum is also produced in Thailand and Malaysia as a by @-@ product of the tin mining there . During gravitational separation of the ores from placer deposits , not only is cassiterite ( <unk> ) found , but a small percentage of tantalite also included . The slag from the tin smelters then contains economically useful amounts of tantalum , which is leached from the slag . 
 World tantalum mine production has undergone an important geographic shift since the start of the 21st century when production was predominantly from Australia and Brazil . Beginning in 2007 and through 2014 , the major sources of tantalum production from mines dramatically shifted to the DRC , Rwanda , and some other African countries . Future sources of supply of tantalum , in order of estimated size , are being explored in Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Greenland , China , Mozambique , Canada , Australia , the United States , Finland , and Brazil . 
 It is estimated that there are less than 50 years left of tantalum resources , based on extraction at current rates , demonstrating the need for increased recycling . 
 = = Status as a conflict resource = = 
 Tantalum is considered a conflict resource . <unk> , the industrial name for a columbite – tantalite mineral from which columbium ( i.e. niobium ) and tantalum are extracted , can also be found in Central Africa , which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( formerly Zaire ) . According to an October 23 , 2003 United Nations report , the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo , a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5 @.@ 4 million deaths since 1998 – making it the world ’ s deadliest documented conflict since World War II . Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior , human rights , and endangering wildlife , due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin . However , although important for the local economy in Congo , the contribution of coltan mining in Congo to the world supply of tantalum is usually small . The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1 % of the world 's tantalum output in 2002 – 2006 , peaking at 10 % in 2000 and 2008 . 
 The stated aim of the Solutions for Hope Tantalum Project is to " source conflict @-@ free tantalum from the Democratic Republic of Congo " 
 = = Production and fabrication = = 
 Several steps are involved in the extraction of tantalum from tantalite . First , the mineral is crushed and concentrated by gravity separation . This is generally carried out near the mine site . 
 = = = Chemical refining = = = 
 Tantalum ores often contain significant amounts of niobium , which is itself a valuable metal . As such , both metals are extracted so that they may be sold . The overall process is one of hydrometallurgy . A large number of chemical treatment procedures for the breakdown of primary sources have been developed . Some of these have been adopted for commercial production while others have been tested on a fairly large scale . There are yet a few others that have been tested only on a laboratory scale . All these processes can essentially be divided into reduction to metallic or compound form ( via aluminothermic or carbothermic reduction reactions ) , chlorination , alkaline fusion and acid dissolution . 
 Extraction begins with a leaching , a step in which the ore is treated with hydrofluoric acid and sulfuric acid to produce water @-@ soluble hydrogen fluorides . This allows the metals to be separated from the various non @-@ metallic impurities in the rock . 
 Ta2O5 + 14 HF → 2 H2 [ TaF7 ] + 5 H2O 
 Nb2O5 + 10 HF → 2 H2 [ NbOF5 ] + 3 H2O 
 The tantalum and niobium hydrogen fluorides are then removed from the aqueous solution by liquid @-@ liquid extraction using organic solvents , such as <unk> or methyl isobutyl ketone . This step allows the simple removal of various metal impurities ( e.g. iron , manganese , <unk> , zirconium ) which remain in the aqueous phase in the form of fluorides . Separation of the tantalum and niobium is then achieved by pH adjustment . Niobium requires a higher level of acidity to remain soluble in the organic phase and can hence be selectively removed by extraction into less acidic water . The pure tantalum hydrogen fluoride solution is then neutralised with aqueous ammonia to give tantalum hydroxide ( Ta ( OH ) 5 ) , which is calcined to tantalum pentoxide ( Ta2O5 ) . 
 H2 [ TaF7 ] + 5 H2O + 7 NH3 → Ta ( OH ) 5 + 7 NH4F 
 2 Ta ( OH ) 5 → Ta2O5 + 5 H2O 
 Alternatively , the tantalum fluoride can be treated with potassium fluoride to produce potassium heptafluorotantalate ( K2 [ TaF7 ] ) 
 H2 [ TaF7 ] + 2 KF → K2 [ TaF7 ] + 2 HF 
 This is used to produce metallic tantalum by reduction with sodium , at approximately 800 ° C in molten salt . 
 K2 [ TaF7 ] + 5 Na → Ta + 5 NaF + 2 KF 
 In an older method , called the Marignac process , the tantalum and niobium were separated by treating the initial aqueous mixture of hydrogen fluorides with potassium fluoride : 
 H2 [ TaF7 ] + 2 KF → K2 [ TaF7 ] + 2 HF 
 H2 [ NbOF5 ] + 2 KF → K2 [ NbOF5 ] + 2 HF 
 The resulting niobium and tantalum potassium @-@ fluorides ( K2 [ TaF7 ] , K2 [ NbOF5 ] ) could then be separated by fractional crystallization , due to their different water <unk> . 
 = = = Electrolysis = = = 
 Electrolysis using a modified version of the Hall – Héroult process . Instead of requiring the input oxide and output metal to be in liquid form , tantalum electrolysis operates on non @-@ liquid powdered oxides . The initial discovery came in 1997 when Cambridge University researchers immersed small samples of certain oxides in baths of molten salt and reduced the oxide with electric current . The cathode uses powdered metal oxide . The anode is made of carbon . The molten salt at 1 @,@ 000 ° C ( 1 @,@ 830 ° F ) is the electrolyte . The first refinery has enough capacity to supply 3 @-@ 4 % of annual global demand . 
 = = = Fabrication and metalworking = = = 
 All welding of tantalum must be done in an inert atmosphere of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases . Tantalum is not <unk> . Grinding tantalum is difficult , especially so for annealed tantalum . In the annealed condition , tantalum is extremely ductile and can be readily formed as metal sheets . 
 = = Applications = = 
 = = = Electronics = = = 
 The major use for tantalum , as the metal powder , is in the production of electronic components , mainly capacitors and some high @-@ power resistors . Tantalum electrolytic capacitors exploit the tendency of tantalum to form a protective oxide surface layer , using tantalum powder , pressed into a pellet shape , as one " plate " of the capacitor , the oxide as the dielectric , and an electrolytic solution or conductive solid as the other " plate " . Because the dielectric layer can be very thin ( thinner than the similar layer in , for instance , an aluminium electrolytic capacitor ) , a high capacitance can be achieved in a small volume . Because of the size and weight advantages , tantalum capacitors are attractive for portable telephones , personal computers , and automotive electronics . 
 = = = Alloys = = = 
 Tantalum is also used to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points , strength , and ductility . <unk> with other metals , it is also used in making carbide tools for metalworking equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components , chemical process equipment , nuclear reactors , and missile parts . Because of its ductility , tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments , which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium . Since it resists attack by body fluids and is <unk> , tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants . For example , porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum 's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue . 
 Tantalum is inert against most acids except hydrofluoric acid and hot sulfuric acid , and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode . This property makes it a useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids . Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum . Tantalum was extensively used in the production of ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters . The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes . 
 = = = Other uses = = = 
 The high melting point and oxidation resistance lead to the use of the metal in the production of vacuum furnace parts . Tantalum is extremely inert and is therefore formed into a variety of corrosion resistant parts , such as <unk> , valve bodies , and tantalum fasteners . Due to its high density , shaped charge and explosively formed penetrator liners have been constructed from tantalum . Tantalum greatly increases the armor penetration capabilities of a shaped charge due to its high density and high melting point . It is also occasionally used in precious watches e.g. from Audemars Piguet , F.P. <unk> , Hublot , Montblanc , Omega , and <unk> . Tantalum is also highly <unk> and is used as an orthopedic implant material . The high stiffness of tantalum makes it necessary to use it as highly porous foam or scaffold with lower stiffness for hip replacement implants to avoid stress shielding . Because tantalum is a non @-@ ferrous , non @-@ magnetic metal , these implants are considered to be acceptable for patients undergoing MRI procedures . The oxide is used to make special high refractive index glass for camera lenses . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 Compounds containing tantalum are rarely encountered in the laboratory . The metal is highly biocompatible and is used for body implants and coatings , therefore attention may be focused on other elements or the physical nature of the chemical compound . 
 People can be exposed to tantalum in the workplace by breathing it in , skin contact , or eye contact . The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) has set the legal limit ( permissible exposure limit ) for tantalum exposure in the workplace as 5 mg / m3 over an 8 @-@ hour workday . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( REL ) of 5 mg / m3 over an 8 @-@ hour workday and a short @-@ term limit of 10 mg / m3 . At levels of 2500 mg / m3 , tantalum is immediately dangerous to life and health . 
 = Brønsted – Lowry acid – base theory = 
 The Brønsted – Lowry theory is an acid – base reaction theory which was proposed independently by Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry in 1923 . The fundamental concept of this theory is that when an acid and a base react with each other , the acid forms its conjugate base , and the base forms its conjugate acid by exchange of a proton ( the hydrogen cation , or H + ) . This theory is a generalization of the Arrhenius theory . 
 = = Definitions of acids and bases = = 
 In the Arrhenius theory acids are defined as substances which dissociate in aqueous solution to give H + ( hydrogen ions ) . Bases are defined as substances which dissociate in aqueous solution to give OH − ( hydroxide ions ) . 
 In 1923 physical chemists Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted in Denmark and Thomas Martin Lowry in England independently proposed the theory that carries their names . In the Brønsted – Lowry theory acids and bases are defined by the way they react with each other , which allows for greater generality . The definition is expressed in terms of an equilibrium expression 
 acid + base ⇌ conjugate base + conjugate acid . 
 With an acid , HA , the equation can be written symbolically as : 
 HA + B ⇌ A − + HB + 
 The equilibrium sign , ⇌ , is used because the reaction can occur in both forward and backward directions . The acid , HA , can lose a proton to become its conjugate base , A − . The base , B , can accept a proton to become its conjugate acid , HB + . Most acid @-@ base reactions are fast so that the components of the reaction are usually in dynamic equilibrium with each other . 
 = = Aqueous solutions = = 
 Consider the following acid – base reaction : 
 CH3COOH + H2O ⇌ CH3COO − + H3O + 
 Acetic acid , CH3COOH , is an acid because it donates a proton to water ( H2O ) and becomes its conjugate base , the acetate ion ( CH3COO − ) . H2O is a base because it accepts a proton from CH3COOH and becomes its conjugate acid , the hydronium ion , ( H3O + ) . 
 The reverse of an acid @-@ base reaction is also an acid @-@ base reaction , between the conjugate acid of the base in the first reaction and the conjugate base of the acid . In the above example , acetate is the base of the reverse reaction and hydronium ion is the acid . 
 H3O + + CH3COO − ⇌ CH3COOH + H2O 
 The power of the Brønsted – Lowry theory is that , in contrast to Arrhenius theory , it does not require an acid to dissociate . 
 = = <unk> substances = = 
 The essence of Brønsted – Lowry theory is that an acid only exists as such in relation to a base , and vice versa . Water is amphoteric as it can act as an acid or as a base . In the image shown at the right one molecule of H2O acts as a base and gains H + to become H3O + while the other acts as an acid and loses H + to become OH − . 
 Another example is furnished by substances like aluminium hydroxide , Al ( OH ) 3 . 
 Al ( OH ) 3 + OH − ⇌ Al ( OH ) − 
 4 , acting as an acid 
 3H + + Al ( OH ) 3 ⇌ 3H2O + Al3 + ( aq ) , acting as a base 
 = = = Non @-@ aqueous solutions = = = 
 The hydrogen ion , or hydronium ion , is a Brønsted – Lowry acid in aqueous solutions , and the hydroxide ion is a base , by virtue of the self @-@ dissociation reaction 
 H2O + H2O ⇌ H3O + + OH − 
 An analogous reaction occurs in liquid ammonia 
 NH3 + NH3 ⇌ NH + 
 4 + NH − 
 2 
 Thus , the ammonium ion , NH + 
 4 , plays the same role in liquid ammonia as does the hydronium ion in water and the amide ion , NH − 
 2 , is analogous to the hydroxide ion . Ammonium salts behave as acids , and amides behave as bases . 
 Some non @-@ aqueous solvents can behave as bases , that is , proton acceptors , in relation to Brønsted – Lowry acids . 
 HA + S ⇌ A − + SH + 
 where S stands for a solvent molecule . The most important such solvents are <unk> , DMSO , and acetonitrile , <unk> , as these solvents has been widely used to measure the acid dissociation constants of organic molecules . Because DMSO is a stronger proton acceptor than H2O the acid becomes a stronger acid in this solvent than in water . Indeed , many molecules behave as acids in non @-@ aqueous solution that do not do so in aqueous solution . An extreme case occurs with carbon acids , where a proton is extracted from a C @-@ H bond . 
 Some non @-@ aqueous solvents can behave as acids . An acidic solvent will increase basicity of substances dissolved in it . For example , the compound CH3COOH is known as acetic acid because of its acidic behaviour in water . However it behaves as a base in liquid hydrogen chloride , a much more acidic solvent . 
 HCl + CH3COOH ⇌ Cl − + CH 
 3C ( OH ) + 
 2 
 = = Comparison with Lewis acid – base theory = = 
 In the same year that Brønsted and Lowry published their theory , G. N. Lewis proposed an alternative theory of acid – base reactions . The Lewis theory is based on electronic structure . A Lewis base is defined as a compound that can donate an electron pair to a Lewis acid , a compound that can accept an electron pair . Lewis 's proposal gives an explanation to the Brønsted – Lowry classification in terms of electronic structure . 
 HA + B : ⇌ A : − + BH + 
 In this representation both the base , B , and the conjugate base , A − , are shown carrying a lone pair of electrons and the proton , which is a Lewis acid , is transferred between them . 
 Lewis later wrote in " To restrict the group of acids to those substances that contain hydrogen interferes as seriously with the systematic understanding of chemistry as would the restriction of the term oxidizing agent to substances containing oxygen . " In Lewis theory an acid , A , and a base , B : , form an adduct , AB , in which the electron pair is used to form a dative covalent bond between A and B. This is illustrated with the formation of the adduct <unk> − BF3 from ammonia and boron trifluoride , a reaction that cannot occur in aqueous solution because boron trifluoride reacts violently with water in a hydrolysis reaction . 
 BF3 + 3H2O → B ( OH ) 3 + <unk> 
 HF ⇌ H + + F − 
 These reactions illustrate that BF3 is an acid in both Lewis and Brønsted – Lowry classifications and emphasizes the consistency between both theories . 
 Boric acid is recognized as a Lewis acid by virtue of the reaction 
 B ( OH ) 3 + H2O ⇌ B ( OH ) − 
 4 + H + 
 In this case the acid does not dissociate , it is the base , H2O that dissociates . A solution of B ( OH ) 3 is acidic because hydrogen ions are liberated in this reaction . 
 There is strong evidence that dilute aqueous solutions of ammonia contain negligible amounts of the ammonium ion 
 H2O + NH3 <unk> OH − + NH + 
 4 
 and that , when dissolved in water , ammonia functions as a Lewis base . 
 = = Comparison with the Lux @-@ Flood theory = = 
 The reactions between certain oxides in non @-@ aqueous media cannot be explained on the basis of Brønsted – Lowry theory . For example , the reaction 
 <unk> + SiO2 → <unk> 
 does not fall within the scope of the Brønsted – Lowry definition of acids and bases . On the other hand , MgO is basic and SiO2 is acidic in the Brønsted – Lowry sense , referring to mixtures in water . 
 2H + + MgO ( s ) → Mg2 + ( aq ) + 2H2O 
 SiO2 ( s ) + 2H2O → SiO4 − 
 4 + 4H + ( ≡ Si ( OH ) 4 ( aq ) ) 
 Lux @-@ Flood theory also classifies magnesium oxide as a base in non @-@ aqueous circumstances . This classification is important in geochemistry . Minerals such as olivine , ( Mg , Fe ) SiO4 are classed as ultramafic ; olivine is a compound of a very basic oxide , MgO , with an acidic oxide , silica , SiO2 .

 Live at Wembley was filmed at the London 's Wembley Arena show of the Dangerously in Love Tour , Beyoncé 's first international solo tour , on November 10 , 2003 . The tour supported her debut solo album , Dangerously in Love ( 2003 ) . Most of the songs on Live at Wembley originate from that album , but it also contains a medley of past songs by her former group Destiny 's Child and two soundtrack singles : " Work It Out " and " Summertime " . The second disc of Live at Wembley contains three previously unreleased studio recorded songs , including a cover of Rose Royce 's " Wishing on a Star " , and one remix each of " Crazy in Love " , " Baby Boy " and " Naughty Girl " . Behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage can be also seen on the DVD . 
 The concert audio was mixed by Rick Camp , the same engineer who mixed at the concert venues . It is uncommon for mix engineers to specialize in both live and recorded mixing . For Camp , " Mixing Beyoncé is a pleasure because she 's a real singer and makes it easy . There is hardly an overdub on this project — it 's 95 percent live Beyoncé . " He further talked about the collaboration with Beyoncé with Mix magazine , saying : " In my 22 years of mixing , I 've never come across anyone who could deliver like she does : vocally and her ability to do a show . I 've seen this young woman run across a 60 @-@ foot stage , hit every note and never miss a thing . And that makes my job so much easier . "

She then introduces " Be with You " as one of her favorite slow jams and starts singing it . For the beginning of " Speechless " she sits on a chair singing the song . She asks the fans in the arena to cheer and announced " Well , this is my very first solo tour as an artist and I 'm very happy to share this wonderful experience with you all tonight in London " . She then starts performing a short Destiny 's Child medley beginning with " Bug a Boo " . Beyoncé then tells the story about the group 's first single " No , No , No Part 2 " and continues performing the song . " Bootylicious " , " Jumpin ' Jumpin ' " , " Say My Name " , " Independent Women Part I " , " ' 03 Bonnie & Clyde " and " Survivor " are performed afterwards as part of the medley . She introduces the next song " Me , Myself and I " saying that she wrote it for all the ladies , " I thought it was something we all need to hear . When we get in these relationships they don 't work out . Sometimes we blame the man , we blame another girl , we blame ourselves . But I think we should take every experience and learn a lesson out of it , even the bad experiences and I want all the ladies to know that we will never disappoint ourselves . You 'll always have yourself . " She introduces the next song " Summertime " as one of her favorite songs asking from the crowd to dance further performing a step dance while footage of flowers was projected on the screen . The lights go out again and Beyoncé appears wearing a grey , sparkly dress for an extended performance of " Dangerously in Love " surrounded by smoke . After the word " Beyonce " is written on the screen several times , she appears on a staircase wearing a long shirt as the opening lines of " Crazy in Love " start and the song 's music video is projected on the screen . Beyoncé then continues singing the song and performing its choreography with her female background dancers and confetti are dropped on stage during the end of the performance .

 = Homer to the Max = 
 " Homer to the Max " is the thirteenth episode of The Simpsons ' tenth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 7 , 1999 . In the episode , Homer discovers that a new television show , Police Cops , has a hero also named Homer Simpson . He is delighted with the positive attention he receives because of his name , but when the television character is rewritten from a hero to a bumbling idiot , he is mocked and taunted , so he changes his name to " Max Power " to rid himself of the negative attention . Max gains new friends , and is forced into a protest to prevent a forest from being knocked down . In the end , he changes his name back to Homer Simpson . 
 The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Pete Michels . Since airing , it has received mixed reviews from television critics . Overall , the episode received a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 5 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Simpson family looks through new mid @-@ season TV shows , and realize they are all pretty lousy . They settle on the pilot episode of Police Cops , a show which follows a suave and dashing detective named Homer Simpson and his partner Lance Kaufman . Homer is delighted with the positive attention he receives because he shares the dashing , intelligent character 's name . Despite the family telling him it is just a coincidence , Homer begins to receive congratulatory phone calls . He begins imitating the character , adopting his distinctive scarf and catchphrase , " ... and that 's the end of that chapter . " 
 Unfortunately , by the second episode of Police Cops , the Homer Simpson character has been rewritten from a handsome man into a stupid , fat , and lazy detective who uses a now ridiculous catchphrase " Uh @-@ oh , Spaghetti @-@ Os ! " when he makes a mistake , which results in Homer being mocked by his friends . Humiliated at being laughed at and being the subject of negative attention , Homer appeals to the producers to change the character back , demanding to know why they changed the character into a bumbling oaf . The producers refuse to either explain their reasons or change the character back . Then , after unsuccessfully attempting to sue the company for improper usage of his old name , Homer legally changes his name to " Max Power " ( a name he got off of a hair dryer ) . 
 Max seems to be more well @-@ adjusted with his new name as all the negative attention had faded away for good , but Marge is somewhat unhappy that he changed his name without consulting her , saying that she fell in love with " Homer Simpson " , though she understands that his new name is opening new doors to success for him . At work , Mr. Burns is impressed by the new name and compliments Max , who decides to shop at <unk> 's in order to further improve his image . There , he meets a successful businessman named Trent Steel and , after a chat , they go out to lunch . 
 Trent invites Max and the family to a garden party . Despite Marge 's reservations , the couple attend the party , where they meet lots of famous people , including actor Woody Harrelson , then @-@ U.S. President Bill Clinton , TV producer Lorne Michaels , and actor Ed Begley , Jr .. Max finds out that the garden party is nothing more than an excuse to save a redwood forest from destruction , something which Max does not like . After traveling with the party guests to the forest , Max , Marge , and the rest of the guests chain themselves to the trees in order to prevent the bulldozers from knocking them down .

 Pete Michels , director of the episode , had read a story in the newspaper about people with famous names . He came up with a way of how Homer 's life could be affected if he saw someone on TV with his name . While creating the Homer Simpson television character , the production staff was deciding if the character should be " cool " throughout the episode , or if he should be an idiot from the beginning . The staff decided to use both methods and have him become an idiot after being seen as cool in the first episode of the new program . The hat Homer wears while walking through the mall is a parody of one owned by Woody Allen . Ron Hauge , a The Simpsons show producer , suggested the name Max Power to a friend who wanted to change his name . His friend , however , did not take it .

 Since airing , this episode has received mixed reviews from television critics . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , wrote that though it was " funny in all the right places , this is an episode of two distinct stories , neither of which mesh together . The whole Ed Begley , Jr. saving the forest bit seems to have been tacked on , as if the stuff about Homer finding his name being abused ( shades of Mr. Sparkle again ? ) ran out of steam . Not a bad show , more a sort of ' So what ? ' show . " Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7 @.@ 7 / 10 rating , commenting that " it has a number of really funny scenes and memorable lines " , but overall " the storyline didn 't really have anywhere to go and the final half of the third act is a complete waste of time . " Morgan <unk> of About.com noted " Homer to the Max " as " one of the most unforgettable episodes " when reviewing the complete tenth season . 
 In an article written for the Modern Day Pirates titled " In Search of The Last Classic Simpsons Episode " , author Brandon listed " Homer to the Max " as a contender for the latest episode that made him feel like he was " watching The Simpsons in their heyday " . He believes it was " the last classic episode before [ the show 's ] episodes start to seriously get spotty in quality " , and from that point on , " they start to go months or even seasons between episodes with polish " .

 " The Shipment " is the fifty @-@ ninth episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise , the seventh episode of season three . It first aired on October 29 , 2003 on the UPN network in the United States . The episode was written by Chris Black and Brent V. Friedman . It was directed by David Straiton , his sixth episode of the series at that point . 
 Set in the 22nd century , the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . In this episode , the crew follow a trail of information to a mining complex which is producing a compound used in the construction of a Xindi weapon , while Chief Engineer Charles " Trip " Tucker ( Connor Trinneer ) makes a discovery about the Xindi sidearms . 
 The episode was filmed in late August and early September at the same time as the season premier was first aired . It used a combination of standing sets along with a handful of new sets to represent locations on the Xindi planet . Two actors resumed their roles from earlier in the season ; John Cothran , Jr. had previously appeared as a Klingon in both Star Trek : The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine . Reviews were mostly positive for " The Shipment " , and it received a 3 @.@ 9 / 6 rating , which was an increase from the re @-@ run shown the previous week but was not as high as the following episode . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At the Xindi Council , Degra reports that the weapon should be ready in a matter of weeks . On Enterprise , the coordinates provided by Tarquin ( in " Exile " ) lead to a planet , and the crew decide to hide the ship while a shuttlecraft manned by Captain Archer , Lieutenant Reed and Major Hayes approaches it . Evading detection , they land and enter a Xindi settlement , where they find a great quantity of kemocite being refined . They then observe Gralik Durr and two associates discussing the deal they have to mine the kemocite for Degra . The away team then beams up a canister of kemocite for analysis , and then follow Gralik back to his home , where they confront him . 
 T 'Pol 's analysis shows that the Xindi probe which attacked Earth ( in " The Expanse " ) contained kemocite . Archer then tells Gralik that Degra will use the kemocite to build a weapon , but the Arboreal denies any knowledge of the plan . Back on Enterprise , Commander Tucker also learns that the kemocite is the key to Reptilian rifle technology . Archer approves his idea to reverse engineer a rifle , but Tucker unknowingly triggers a self @-@ destruct sequence and the weapon is beamed into space . Archer then decides not to destroy the kemocite mining complex as he doesn 't want the Xindi to think of them as aggressors . 
 On the planet , Gralik explains that Degra told him that the kemocite was for research , and explains how the Avian race were assumed to be made extinct in the Xindi Civil War . A Reptilian shuttle arrives early , carrying Degra , to collect the final shipment of kemocite . Gralik takes the away team to a cave that will protect them from scans , but they are soon attacked by robotic drones sent by the Reptilians . When Gralik returns home , he is confronted by Degra , who reveals the true purpose of the kemocite , to build a weapon to destroy a ruthless alien species . T 'Pol in the meantime has modified the canister of kemocite so that the ship can track it . Archer manages to sneak it aboard the shuttle and after the Reptilians leave , Archer thanks Gralik for his trust and help .

 Filming of the episode started on August 29 , 2003 , overlapping with the final day of the shoot for the episode " Exile " . As the final scenes to be shot for " Exile " only required Linda Park from the main cast , the remaining cast were freed up to shoot scenes for " The Shipment " . The first scenes to be filmed were those concerning the subplot of the episode where Tucker attempts to take apart the Xindi rifle . Filming resumed on the day after Labor Day with all of the main cast involved . Most of the sets used were the Enterprise standing sets , but additional sets were required to represent Gralik 's home , the Xindi complex and a forest and cave area . During the shoot , live footage was shot of the sets and was presented by Scott Bakula for Good Day Live in order to promote the series three premier " The Xindi " , which aired that evening . 
 It was the second episode of the season for director David Straiton after the second episode , " Anomaly " , and his sixth episode of the series overall . Chris Black and Brent Friedman wrote the episode together . They were both producers on the show ; Black a co @-@ executive producer and Friedman a consulting producer . They had each written episodes of the series separately with Friedman credited for " Raijin " . Black has several credits to his name on the show , including " First Flight " and " Carbon Creek " . The episode saw the return of John Cothran Jr . , who had previously played two Klingons in previously Star Trek series . These were Nu <unk> in the The Next Generation episode " The Chase " and Telok in the Deep Space Nine episode " Crossover " . Other cast returning from earlier in the season were Steven Culp as Major Hayes and Randy Oglesby as the Xindi Degra .

 = Æthelred ( bishop ) = 
 Æthelred ( or Ethelred ; died 30 June 888 ) was an Anglo @-@ Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury in medieval England . Although one source states that he was Bishop of Wiltshire prior to his elevation to Canterbury , this has been shown to be false . Much of Æthelred 's time in office was spent dealing with the dislocations caused by the invasion of England by Vikings . There were also conflicts with King Alfred the Great over ecclesiastical matters as well as the desire of the papacy to reform the English clergy . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Some sources , including the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , in the F version of that work , state that Æthelred was transferred in 870 from the Bishopric of Wiltshire to the see of Canterbury . However , the transfer has now been proven to be taken from the life of Ælfric of Abingdon , who was archbishop from 995 to 1005 . Although the story of his transfer is false , Æthelred was consecrated as archbishop in 870 . Why he was selected for Canterbury is unknown , as there is no contemporary information on his election . 
 Most of Æthelred 's time as archbishop was spent dealing with the effects of Viking raids , but he also had a conflict with King Alfred the Great over royal control of ecclesiastical affairs . It was during Æthelred 's archbishopric that the Golden Gospels , a still @-@ surviving 8th century gospel book , was ransomed from a raiding army and donated to Canterbury . Pope John VIII also urged Æthelred and Archbishop Wulfhere of York to reform the dress of the English clergy . The Anglo @-@ Saxon clergy wore the short tunic that was the normal costume of the laypeople of Britain . The Roman custom , however , was to wear long clerical robes or habits , and the Anglo @-@ Saxon custom was opposed by the papacy and other continental clergy . Whether Æthelred and Wulfred took steps to try to change the dress of their clergy is unknown , but the clothing customs of the Anglo @-@ Saxon clergy did not change . 
 Around 877 , Æthelred wrote to Pope John VIII to complain about King Alfred 's conduct towards Canterbury . The exact nature of the dispute is not clear , but the reply from the pope to the archbishop still exists . The pope told the archbishop that Canterbury had papal support and that the pope had written to the king urging the king to respect the rights of the archbishop . The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for the deposition of Alfred , which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 and that the deposition was supported by Æthelred . Other historians , however , do not agree that there was a deposition of the king supported by the archbishop at this time . 
 Æthelred also reached an agreement with <unk> , an ealdorman , where <unk> was granted the life use of a Canterbury estate in return for bequeathing one of his estates to Canterbury after his death . The document that records this agreement is not dated , however , so it is unknown when exactly during Æthelred 's episcopate the document was drawn up . Another problem for the archbishop was a decline in the abilities of the scribes at Canterbury , which is dramatically illustrated by the document , which has a number of errors and duplications . Other documents of the period show that some of the scribes had little knowledge of Latin . 
 Æthelred died 30 June 888 .

 The 2002 San Francisco Bowl was the inaugural edition of the post @-@ season college football bowl game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the Air Force Falcons at Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco , California on December 31 , 2002 . The game was the final contest of the 2002 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season for both teams , and ended in a 20 – 13 victory for Virginia Tech . 
 Virginia Tech was selected for the inaugural edition of the San Francisco Bowl ( now the Fight Hunger Bowl ) after a 9 – 4 record during the 2002 college football season . Tech defeated several nationally ranked teams , including No. 14 LSU and No. 19 Texas A & M. Tech 's opponent , Air Force , received its bid following an 8 – 4 regular season . Air Force faced several BCS @-@ conference opponents during the regular season , including California and Northwestern . 
 The 2002 San Francisco Bowl kicked off in clear , 69 ° F ( 21 ° C ) weather , but the field was soggy after several days of rain . In the first seven minutes of the game , Air Force scored 10 consecutive unanswered points . The Tech defense eventually clamped down on the Falcons ' offense , however , and only allowed three points for the remainder of the game . The Virginia Tech offense slowly climbed back from the initial 10 @-@ point deficit , scoring a touchdown in the first quarter and a field goal in the second . By halftime , the Hokies had equalized the score at 10 – 10 . 
 In the second half , defense continued to dominate as Tech gradually built a lead . The Hokies scored the only points of a third quarter as running back Lee Suggs ran into the end zone from one yard out , allowing Tech to take a 17 – 10 lead into the fourth quarter . The Falcons didn 't give up easily , however . Air Force kicker Joey Ashcroft cut into the Tech lead with a 21 @-@ yard field goal . Tech matched the score later in the quarter to restore the one @-@ touchdown lead . As time ran down , Air Force had one final chance to tie the game and send it into overtime . Beginning at its own 18 @-@ yard line with 4 : 11 left to play , the Falcons drove deep into Tech territory . With seven seconds remaining , Air Force quarterback Chance Harridge tried to scramble into the end zone , but was stopped before the goal line by Tech cornerback <unk> Whitaker . The defensive stop preserved the 20 – 13 Hokie victory , and Tech quarterback Bryan Randall was named the game 's most valuable player .

 The Air Force Falcons began the 2002 season having gone 6 – 6 during the previous season , and hoping to put that disappointing showing behind them . On August 31 , 2002 , the Falcons did just that , defeating Northwestern in a blowout 52 – 3 victory . Following that win , the Falcons added five more in successive weeks , racing out to a 6 – 0 undefeated start . On October 19 , the Falcons faced No. 19 Notre Dame , and in a close @-@ fought game , suffered their first loss . In the five games that followed the loss to Notre Dame , the Falcons suffered three additional losses , culminating in a close regular @-@ season defeat by the San Diego State Aztecs . 
 After starting with six straight wins , the Falcons finished with an overall regular @-@ season record of 8 – 4 and a Mountain West Conference record of 4 – 3 , putting them third in the conference . Air Force was one of three bowl @-@ eligible teams in the Mountain West during the 2002 season . MWC champion Colorado State earned an automatic bid to the Liberty Bowl , and the Las Vegas Bowl , which had second pick of MWC teams , selected New Mexico . By default , this left Air Force to the San Francisco Bowl .

 The Virginia Tech Hokies football team began the 2002 season having gone 8 – 4 the previous season and having suffered a season @-@ ending defeat to Florida State in the 2002 Gator Bowl . The Hokies began the season against the Arkansas State Indians , hoping to rebuild after the loss of 11 starters from the previous season 's team . Against the Indians , Tech started the season with a record performance , scoring 56 first @-@ half points en route to a 63 – 7 rout . 
 That overwhelming start was just the beginning for the Hokies , who won their next seven games , racing to an 8 – 0 start and a No. 3 ranking in the national polls . In their ninth game of the season , however , the Hokies suffered their first loss , falling 21 – 28 to the Pittsburgh Panthers . The next week , Tech suffered an even closer loss , losing to Syracuse in triple overtime despite a record performance from Tech quarterback Bryan Randall , who accumulated 504 passing yards and five touchdown passes . 
 In the three games following the loss to Syracuse , Tech lost two , taking it to a final regular @-@ season record of 9 – 4 overall and a Big East conference record of 3 – 4 , meaning Tech was the fourth ranked team in the Big East that season . Prior to the season , the Big East had signed an agreement with the new San Francisco Bowl , giving that bowl the fifth pick of bowl @-@ eligible teams in the Big East . But with the Gator Bowl ( second pick of Big East teams ) selecting Notre Dame instead of a Big East team , all the Big East 's selections were pushed back one slot . Second @-@ place West Virginia University was pushed to the Continental Tire Bowl ( third pick ) and third @-@ place Pittsburgh was selected by the Insight Bowl ( fourth pick ) , leaving Virginia Tech to be selected by the San Francisco Bowl with the fifth pick .

 On the day prior to the game , spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 11 @.@ 5 points . Despite that advantage , Tech head coach Frank Beamer warned his team and the public about the threat underdog Air Force posed to the Hokies ' chances of winning . Both Beamer and Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry were among the longest @-@ tenured coaches in college football at the time . DeBerry had been a college coach for 19 years , while Beamer had coached for 16 years . The game would be an opportunity for DeBerry to gain his 150th career win and defeat a ranked team for the first time since 1999 . Ticket sales prior to the game were sluggish , as both teams failed to sell out their assigned allotments , and local sales registered fewer than 8 @,@ 000 tickets sold . In addition , local media coverage of the game was very sparse .

Palmer and the Falcons had already clinched the season 's rushing title , cementing their status as the No. 1 rushing team in the country after West Virginia — the second @-@ place team — failed to gain sufficient yardage in its final game to pass the Falcons . Despite finishing with the top @-@ ranked rushing offense , none of Air Force 's offensive linemen received postseason honors . " It should give our players a lot of incentive for next year . Hopefully , if we repeat next year , maybe we 'll get two or three on there . You certainly don 't accumulate the number of yards we do unless you have people up front doing their job , " DeBerry said at the time .

 The Virginia Tech offense averaged 31 @.@ 5 points per game during the regular season .

He needed just 149 more rushing yards to set the team 's record for single @-@ season rushing yards , which stood at 1 @,@ 403 . Even without the record , Suggs was predicted to be a high pick in that year 's NFL Draft . Suggs was supported by Virginia Tech center Jake Grove , who anchored a strong Tech offensive line .

About Grove , Suggs said , " He gets the blocking scheme straight . ... He gets us ready to go . " 
 Also benefiting from the offensive line 's strength was Tech quarterback Bryan Randall . Randall finished the regular season with 1 @,@ 957 passing yards and 12 passing touchdowns , completing 140 of his 225 passes during the process .

In the final five games ( in which Tech went 1 – 4 ) , the Hokie defense allowed averages of 32 @.@ 8 points , 446 @.@ 7 total yards and 229 @.@ 4 rushing yards per game . This led to doubts about Tech 's ability to stop the Falcons ' top @-@ ranked rushing attack .

" That late @-@ season falter still saw Tech ranked as the No. 20 rushing defense in the country heading into the San Francisco Bowl , allowing an average of just 113 @.@ 31 yards per game . 
 One of the keys for the Hokie defense would be linebacker Brandon Manning , who attended the Air Force Academy 's preparatory school before deciding to walk on to Virginia Tech 's football team instead of attending the Academy . Manning was Tech 's No. 3 tackler in terms of statistics , accumulating 70 tackles during the course of the regular season .

This was a surprise because the Falcons had been ranked among the least @-@ proficient teams in the country in terms of passing offense . The pass drove the Falcons offense deep into Virginia Tech territory , and Air Force continued to advance the ball with a series of short rushes that resulted in a first down . Then , on the sixth play of the Air Force drive , running back Matt Ward ran a reverse for 15 yards and the game 's first touchdown . Air Force kicker Joey Ashcroft successfully completed the extra point , and Air Force took a 7 – 0 lead with 12 minutes remaining in the first quarter . 
 Virginia Tech received the post @-@ touchdown kickoff and returned it to their 31 @-@ yard line , where the Tech offense took over on its first possession of the game . Tech running back Lee Suggs ran for a three @-@ yard gain , and quarterback Bryan Randall completed a 15 @-@ yard pass to take the Hokies to near midfield , earning Virginia Tech a first down in the process . But on the third play after taking possession , the Hokies turned the ball over as Tech running back Lee Suggs fumbled the ball . Air Force recovered the turnover and returned it to the Tech 35 @-@ yard line , where the Falcons offense returned to the field . Despite gaining possession of the ball deep inside Virginia Tech 's side of the field , Air Force was unable to move the ball forward with much success . After a quick first down provided by a penalty against Virginia Tech , the Hokie defense stiffened and denied the Falcons another . Air Force was forced to attempt a 45 @-@ yard field goal , which Ashcroft converted with 7 : 36 left in the quarter to give the Falcons a 10 – 0 . 
 Air Force 's post @-@ score kickoff went out of bounds , resulting in a penalty that allowed Tech to automatically start its second offensive possession of the game at its 35 @-@ yard line . On his first play , Randall completed a 19 @-@ yard pass that drove the Hokie offense into Air Force territory for the first time and gained Tech another first down . Two plays later , Randall completed another pass , this time a 16 @-@ yard toss that pushed Tech to the Air Force 30 @-@ yard line . Though the Hokies gained several more yards on short plays , they were unable to earn another first down . Tech kicker Carter Warley was sent into the game to attempt a 41 @-@ yard field goal , but the kick bounced off the right upright and Tech was denied three points . With 4 : 59 remaining in the first quarter , Air Force still held a 10 – 0 lead . 
 Following the missed field goal , Air Force 's offense began operations at its 24 @-@ yard line . Running back Anthony Butler broke free for an 18 @-@ yard gain on the third play of the drive , giving Air Force a first down . Two plays later , however , Harridge threw a pass that was intercepted by Tech linebacker Vegas Robinson . At the end of the play , Air Force committed a 15 @-@ yard personal foul penalty , which allowed the Tech offense to take over at the Air Force 15 @-@ yard line . Tech needed just two plays to drive the 15 yards and earn a touchdown , its first of the game . With 2 : 26 remaining in the quarter , Air Force 's lead had been cut to 10 – 7 . 
 After Tech 's kickoff , Air Force went three and out and was forced to punt . The Hokies took over at their 34 @-@ yard line after the kick . Bryan Randall completed two quick passes to wide receiver Shawn Witten for a total of 26 yards before time in the quarter ran out . At the end of the first quarter , Air Force had a 10 – 7 lead , but Virginia Tech was in possession of the ball and driving deeper into Air Force territory . 
 = = = Second quarter = = = 
 The Hokies began the second quarter in possession of the ball and facing a second down and one yard . After the Tech offense picked up one first down , it was unable to gain another . Facing a fourth down and needing five yards for a first down at the Air Force 29 @-@ yard line , Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to try to gain the first down instead of trying a long field goal . Bryan Randall was sacked for a loss of 10 yards , however , and the Hokies turned the ball over to Air Force after failing to gain the first down . 
 Air Force began its offensive possession at its 39 @-@ yard line , and like Virginia Tech , soon found itself facing a fourth down . Like Virginia Tech , it elected to try to convert the down , but unlike Virginia Tech , the Falcons were successful in gaining the needed yardage . Two plays later , however , Harridge threw his second interception of the game to the Tech defense . Tech 's offense took the field , and gained a first down , but was forced to punt after failing to gain a second . Air Force likewise gained a first down on offense and did gain a second , but could not gain a third . 
 After another Falcon punt , the Hokies took over on offense at their 49 @-@ yard line with 4 : 12 remaining before halftime . Tech began advancing the ball , and was aided by a 15 @-@ yard penalty against Air Force that pushed the Hokies deep into Falcons territory . Running backs Kevin Jones and Lee Suggs advanced the ball on the ground with short rushes , and Randall contributed short passes at times , gaining needed first downs when required . Tech advanced the ball inside the Air Force 10 @-@ yard line , gaining a first down at the nine @-@ yard line . There , the Air Force defense stiffened . Tech gained four yards on three plays , but was unable to cross the goal line for another touchdown . Tech kicker Warley entered the game to attempt his second field goal try of the game . The 23 @-@ yard kick was more successful than his first try , and with 25 seconds remaining in the first half , tied the game at 10 – 10 . 
 Air Force received the kickoff and ran one quick rushing play to allow the first half to come to an end with the score tied at 10 . 
 = = = Third quarter = = = 
 Because Air Force received the ball to begin the game , Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half . Tech returned the kickoff to its 25 @-@ yard line , where the Hokie offense began the first drive of the second half . The Tech offense used rushes by Lee Suggs and passes by Bryan Randall to pick up several first downs and drive into Air Force territory . But once on the Falcons ' side of the field , Tech proved unable to gain another first down and was even pushed back into its own territory by a penalty . Tech was forced to punt , and Air Force began its first offensive possession of the second half at its 20 @-@ yard line after a touchback . 
 On the first Air Force play of the second half , quarterback Chance Harridge ran up the middle of the field for a 21 @-@ yard gain . The Falcons followed that first @-@ down play with a series of rushes that resulted in another first down , this time in Virginia Tech territory . But as the Hokies had done before them , the Falcons faltered inside opposition territory . Instead of punting the ball , however , Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry kept his offense on the field to attempt to gain the needed two yards on fourth down . The attempt was unsuccessful , and Tech 's offense returned to the field with 7 : 40 remaining in the quarter . 
 The Hokies took over at their 39 @-@ yard line , and immediately found success . Randall connected on two 10 @-@ yard passes to take the Hokies into Air Force territory . The two passes were followed by a 16 @-@ yard run by Tech fullback Doug <unk> for another first down at the Air Force 24 @-@ yard line . From there , the Tech ground game continued to eat up yards and result in first downs . Kevin Jones ran the ball twice for 11 yards , then Lee Suggs ran the ball three times for 13 yards , the last carry also resulting in a touchdown . The score and subsequent extra point gave Tech its first lead of the game , 17 – 10 , with 4 : 45 remaining . 
 Following the post @-@ touchdown kickoff , the two teams traded punts . Air Force gained a first down before punting , Tech was forced into a three and out , and as the quarter came to an end , Air Force was facing a third down and seven yards at the Tech 29 @-@ yard line . Tech still held a 17 – 10 lead , but the Falcons appeared to be in striking distance . 
 = = = Fourth quarter = = = 
 Air Force began the final quarter of play in possession of the ball and facing a third down at the Virginia Tech 29 @-@ yard line . Needing seven yards for a first down , the Falcons picked up six . Instead of attempting a field goal on fourth down , DeBerry ordered another fourth @-@ down conversion , which was successful . Three plays later , Tech 's defense again forced a fourth down , and again DeBerry ordered a fourth @-@ down conversion . The try was again successful , and Air Force earned another first down . Virginia Tech 's defense continued to prevent Air Force from gaining a big play or a touchdown , however , and forced another fourth down . Considering his third fourth @-@ down conversion in the same drive , coach DeBerry instead sent in kicker Joey Ashcroft , who kicked a 21 @-@ yard field goal to cut Virginia Tech 's lead to 17 – 13 with 9 : 50 to go in the quarter . 
 Tech returned the post @-@ touchdown kickoff to its 34 @-@ yard line , where the Hokies began their first offensive drive of the fourth quarter . Randall ran for nine yards , Suggs for three , then Randall completed two passes for 16 yards to push the Hokies into Air Force territory . Once there , Tech continued to grind forward as Suggs ran the ball on five consecutive plays for 15 yards and a first down . After Randall was sacked for a loss of eight yards , however , Tech sent in Warley , who kicked a 37 @-@ yard line to restore Tech 's seven @-@ point lead , 20 – 13 , with 4 : 03 to go in the game . 
 With time running out , Air Force seemingly had one last opportunity to drive down the field and send the game into overtime with a touchdown and extra point or to win it outright with a touchdown and two @-@ point conversion . The Falcons began their drive at their 18 @-@ yard line after Tech 's kickoff . At the start , Air Force was aided by a 15 @-@ yard penalty against Virginia Tech . From there , the going was less easy , as Air Force used short rushes by Anthony Butler , Harridge , and Steve Massie to gain two first downs and advance the ball into Virginia Tech territory . Then , facing third down at the Virginia Tech 47 @-@ yard line , Harridge completed an 18 @-@ yard pass to tight end Adam Strecker . It was just Harridge 's second completion of the game — the first having taken place in the second play of the game . Following the pass , the Falcons were hampered by a 10 @-@ yard illegal blocking penalty , but a 19 @-@ yard pass to James Walker erased that deficit and gave Air Force a first down at the Virginia Tech 10 @-@ yard line . Time was rapidly running out , but there was still time for Air Force to attempt a few plays . Harridge threw two passes that fell incomplete , then attempted a desperation run towards the end zone . He was tackled five yards short of the goal line , however , and time expired . 
 Virginia Tech escaped with the 20 – 13 victory thanks to the defensive stop .

 Thanks to his performance during the game , Air Force quarterback Chance Harridge became just the fifth player in Air Force history and the 16th player in NCAA Division I @-@ A history to rush for 1 @,@ 000 yards and pass for 1 @,@ 000 yards in the same season . Despite that performance , Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall was named the game 's most valuable player for his winning effort . Randall finished the game having completed 18 of his 23 passes for 177 yards . Harridge completed four of his 19 passes for 91 yards and two interceptions . After completing a pass on the second play of the game , Harridge did not complete another pass until there were less than five minutes remaining in the game , throwing 11 consecutive incomplete passes in the intervening period . 
 The 2002 San Francisco Bowl was the final collegiate game of Tech running back Lee Suggs , whose two touchdowns allowed him to finish his collegiate career with 336 points , the second @-@ most career points scored by a player in the Big East . Suggs also extended his NCAA @-@ record streak of consecutive games with a rushing touchdown to 27 . That record still stands today . Suggs finished the game with 19 carries for 70 rushing yards and two touchdowns . Tech wide receiver Ernest Wilford , who caught five passes for 50 yards , set what was then a school record for receptions in a season with 51 . This broke the record of 46 , set by Mike <unk> in 1971 . 
 Air Force finished the game with 227 rushing yards and 318 total yards on offense . The Falcons also committed four 15 @-@ yard personal foul penalties in addition to other , more minor , penalties accumulated during the game . Air Force 's leading rusher was Anthony Butler , who carried the ball 17 times for 75 yards . Anthony Park was the Falcons ' leading receiver , catching Harridge 's second @-@ play 47 @-@ yard throw for his only reception of the game .

 Virginia Tech 's win took it to a final 2002 record of 10 – 4 , while Air Force 's loss dropped it to a final record of 8 – 5 . Tech finished with its third 10 @-@ win @-@ or @-@ more season in four years , and secured a spot in the final Associated Press Top 25 poll of the season for the fifth consecutive season . 
 Attendance was low , in part due to Tech fans ' reluctance to travel across the country and pay high prices for the chance to do so . Travel agents indicated low business in the weeks leading up to the game , and Tech sold approximately 5 @,@ 000 tickets — a far lower total than the Hokies ' two previous bowl games , when 25 @,@ 000 tickets each were sold to games in Florida and Louisiana . 
 = Robin Friday = 
 Robin Friday ( 27 July 1952 – 22 December 1990 ) was an English footballer who played professionally as a forward for Reading and Cardiff City during a career that lasted four years in the mid @-@ 1970s . His on @-@ field performances were regarded as excellent , and he won Reading 's player of the year award in both of his full seasons there , as well as being the leading goal scorer . However , his habit of unsettling opponents through physical intimidation contributed to a heavily tarnished disciplinary record , and his personal life was one of heavy smoking , drinking , womanising and drug abuse . Despite his short career , he remains prominent in the memory of Reading and Cardiff supporters , both as a player and a personality . He has been voted Reading 's best ever player three times . 
 Born and raised in Acton , west London , Friday was scouted , but not retained , by four professional clubs during his teenage years . He appeared for local semi @-@ professional sides in the Isthmian League until he joined Charlie Hurley 's Fourth Division Reading team in 1974 — quickly becoming a key player , he helped Reading to win promotion to the Third Division during the 1975 – 76 season . As his drug habit intensified , Friday 's form began to dip in the first half of the 1976 – 77 season , leading Reading to sell him to Second Division side Cardiff City around the New Year . Friday travelled to join his new team by train without a valid ticket and had to be bailed by the Cardiff manager Jimmy Andrews before he signed for the club . He performed strongly on his debut , but afterwards his form declined and his personal life caused him to repeatedly miss matches altogether . Following a number of incidents , on and off the field — including kicking Mark Lawrenson in the face mid @-@ game — Friday retired from football in December 1977 , aged 25 . He died in Acton in 1990 , aged 38 , after suffering a heart attack . 
 The strongest aspects of Friday 's game were his ball skills , footballing intelligence and physical and mental strength . Andrews labelled Friday " the complete centre @-@ forward " , and , along with numerous contemporaries , retrospectively rated Friday as good enough for the England national team . In a 2004 BBC poll , Friday was voted the top " all @-@ time cult hero " for both Reading and Cardiff City . The Cardiff @-@ based band Super Furry Animals dedicated their 1996 single " The Man Don 't Give a Fuck " to his memory . 
 = = Early life and non @-@ League career = = 
 = = = Childhood = = = 
 Robin Friday and his twin brother , Tony , were born in Acton , west London , on 27 July 1952 . Their parents , Alf Friday , a driver for a laundry firm , and his wife Sheila , were both born in Acton and had married a year before , both aged 20 , having met three years earlier . Sheila 's father , Frederick Riding , had played professional football for Brentford before the Second World War . The Fridays lived with Sheila 's family until moving into a prefab of their own in Acton Green when Robin and Tony were aged two ; they moved to a maisonette in South Acton in 1962 when it was found that the prefab was sinking . Robin and Tony were later described by their mother as having been remarkably close , rarely arguing or fighting . A noticeable difference in personality was that Robin was shy , whereas Tony was more confident . The twins attended their first professional match at the age of two , when their father took them to a Brentford match at Griffin Park . From the age of four Alf took both boys to play football at a local park every afternoon . 
 Around the age of ten , Friday possessed notable ball @-@ skills , and according to his father could flick an orange up onto his neck , balance it and then let it roll it back down his body and catch it on his foot . As well as football , Robin played cricket to a high standard , boxed and played tennis . Despite their many similarities and common interest in sports and football in particular , the twins were wildly different in academic terms : while Tony did well at school , Friday was uninterested and according to his brother " was always <unk> off , having birds around the park " . 
 Friday was scouted by numerous London sides during his teenage years , joining Crystal Palace 's school of excellence at 12 or 13 , then moving on to Queens Park Rangers aged 13 and then to Chelsea , with whom he attended the 1967 FA Cup Final ; as one of the club 's youth players , he was part of the team 's official party . However , Friday 's individual style of play and refusal to change his game resulted in each of these clubs losing patience with him . The twin brothers joined a men 's team , the Acton British Legion Reserves , aged 14 , and in some matches would play alongside their father . Tony played in midfield , and Robin up front , but according to Tony his brother was better as a goalkeeper than a forward : " He was a brilliant goalkeeper . He had no fear ... But he obviously preferred banging them in at the other end " . Around this time Robin became interested in music , dancing and attending concerts ; he also had a talent for drawing , but suddenly abandoned this interest at 15 . Robin became more outgoing than his brother and started taking drugs in his mid @-@ teens . He left school at 15 , a year before Tony , and began training as a plasterer . 
 = = = Borstal , first marriage and the Isthmian League = = = 
 Friday lasted two months as a plasterer before moving on to become first a van driver for a grocery firm , then a window cleaner . His laid @-@ back attitude and indifference was already clear : in his father 's words , " he didn 't care " . Friday regularly stole by this time , but despite numerous convictions , did not go to a detention centre until he was 16 . Having been caught stealing what Tony recalled to be " a car radio or something " , he was released almost immediately because he suffered from asthma . However , after he re @-@ offended three months later he was sent to Feltham Borstal where he served 14 months . During his time there , Friday became stronger and fitter and also starred for the Borstal football team . He was selected for the prison league 's all @-@ star men 's team , still aged 16 , and allowed out of Borstal to train and play with Reading 's youth team , for which he appeared three times in the South East Counties League during the 1968 – 69 season . 
 After his release , Friday returned to Acton , where he had a girlfriend called Maxine <unk> and a baby daughter called Nicola . Maxine was of mixed race . The local controversy surrounding the interracial relationship caused the couple and their circle of friends to be socially isolated , and led to a physical attack on the group one night in an Acton public house . Despite this , and the opposition by both sets of parents — Alf refused to even attend the wedding — they married , both aged 17 . Friday did not take his marital commitments seriously and continued to <unk> , drink heavily and take narcotics . A friend who played for Walthamstow Avenue , a semi @-@ professional Isthmian League club from north @-@ east London , took Friday along to training one day in early 1971 . Friday played well enough for Walthamstow to sign him the same day on wages of £ 10 per week . Many of his new team @-@ mates were <unk> from east London , and Friday soon joined them in that trade . 
 Friday made his debut for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971 , against Bromley , coming off the bench to set up Walthamstow 's equaliser . His first goal came on 17 April , when playing against Tooting & Mitcham he once again appeared as a substitute and scored a header late in the game . He joined west London club Hayes in December 1971 after scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League match . Hayes offered £ 30 per week , and were also based closer to his home in Acton . A near @-@ fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery ; while working on a roof in Lambeth , a hoist rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on . The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike : the spike went up through one of his buttocks , through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung . Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off the spike , he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972 . 
 Friday was known at Hayes for his excessive drinking , and on one occasion the team started a match a player short because Friday had not turned up . When he finally arrived , eighty minutes after kick @-@ off , his intoxication was obvious , but he was still sent onto the pitch with the match still goalless . The opposition paid him little attention and Friday scored a late winning goal . Hayes were drawn to play Football League Fourth Division club Reading in the FA Cup 's second round on 9 December 1972 ; the team managed to draw 0 – 0 at Reading and earn the right to a replay at home , which they lost 1 – 0 three days later . Although Hayes had lost , the interest of Reading manager Charlie Hurley was piqued . Hurley travelled to Hayes more than once to watch Friday . Having researched the player 's background , he was cautious about signing him , but was impressed all the same by his on @-@ field performances . 
 The 1972 – 73 season was Friday 's most prolific non @-@ League year in terms of goals . He briefly joined Enfield early in the 1973 – 74 season and scored against Hayes in an FA Cup tie before returning to west London in December 1973 . Having also been approached by Third Division side Watford , Friday signed for Hurley 's Reading side in January 1974 for £ 750 . He had scored 46 goals in 67 appearances for Hayes over his two spells there , but during his three Isthmian League seasons had been sent off seven times . Friday signed as an amateur , meaning that although he would be contracted to Reading he would be able to continue appearing for Hayes and working as an asphalter in London ; he would train part @-@ time with Reading and play for their reserve team . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 = = = Reading = = = 
 = = = = 1973 – 74 = = = = 
 In Hurley 's words , Friday " trained like he played " ; " he had no other way of playing " . His new manager had to take him out of training on occasion because of the injuries he would inflict on his own team @-@ mates in his effort to win . By late January 1974 , Reading were on a run of 14 games with only two victories , while Friday had performed strongly in three reserve matches . Hurley registered the amateur forward to play in the Football League on 23 January 1974 and gave him his first @-@ team debut four days later . Friday turned in a performance against Northampton Town at Elm Park that the Reading Evening Post called " outstanding " as Reading drew 3 – 3 . The team then travelled to Barnsley on 3 February , having not won away from home in four months . After Barnsley led 2 – 0 at half @-@ time , Friday scored his first League goal with a header just after the break to make the score 2 – 1 . Reading immediately offered a professional contract , which Friday signed on 6 February 1974 . His new salary was half what he had earned as an asphalter . 
 Friday 's technical ability made him very popular among Reading supporters and pressmen alike . The Reading Evening Post report of Reading 's 4 – 1 victory over Exeter City on 10 February 1974 , Friday 's first match as a professional , described his performance as " sheer magic " as he scored twice . The report also called Friday 's first goal of the day " glorious " : he collected the ball wide on the left wing , took it past four Exeter defenders and then fired the ball low and hard into the opposite corner from the edge of the penalty area . Friday was conspicuous in the professional ranks for never wearing shin pads , and for his resistance to physical harm ; no matter how badly he was hurt he would always get up and continue . 
 After sustaining a calf injury against Exeter , he returned for the team 's next game , away at Lincoln City on 17 February . Friday was repeatedly and cynically fouled by the opposing players and sustained injuries necessitating five minutes on the sideline late in the first half . However , he recovered , returned to the game and set up both Reading goals as his side prevailed by a score of two goals to nil . The team 's next game , on 24 February 1974 , was at home against Doncaster Rovers , and with Friday playing a key role Reading won 5 – 0 . In particular , Friday scored a goal after 17 minutes described by the Evening Post reporter as " magical " : with the score 1 – 0 to Reading , Friday received the ball near the edge of the penalty area , at a tight angle , and coolly kicked the ball with the outside of his boot low across goal , towards the far post . Although it appeared to be heading yards wide of the net , the ball suddenly curved in at the last possible moment — " right around the goalie " , in the phrase of Reading F.C. historian David Downs — and clipped the goalpost before nestling in the back of the net . " The team that has been transformed by Robin Friday has now scored a remarkable 16 goals in five games , " reported the Evening Post , " and the highlight of this joyous afternoon was a goal by Friday that was worth anyone 's admission money on its own . " 
 Despite his immediate impact on the pitch and the upturn in Reading 's form , Friday 's off @-@ the @-@ field activities unsettled some of his team @-@ mates . Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team , but some , particularly defender Tommy <unk> , were sceptical . He drank extremely heavily , favouring American Colt 45 malt liquor , and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him . For example , Friday was barred from Caversham 's Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing on the bar . The Boar 's Head in Reading banned him on ten separate occasions . One night , after the pubs closed , Friday and a friend , Rod Lewington , went to an all @-@ night club called Churchill 's where they could continue drinking . When they entered , Friday , wearing a long overcoat and <unk> boots , walked onto the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath . He then began to dance , completely naked apart from the boots . 
 Although Churchill 's , described by Lewington as " the worst club that has ever been in Reading " , tolerated such behaviour , the town 's fashionable <unk> Mill nightclub did not , regularly barring Friday for his bizarre activities , including a dance he invented called " the elephant " which consisted of turning the pockets of his jeans inside out and undoing his flies to expose himself . He and his friends would regularly drink all day , though he was able to exert some self @-@ control ; according to his friend Syd Simmonds , Friday would obey Hurley 's instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game . However , he would play his prized heavy metal records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take LSD with casual indifference . Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club 's elderly ex @-@ groundsman , but to no avail : " Even if it was three in the morning , the first thing would be to get the music playing " , Simmonds later said . " We had an old boy living below us ... the ex @-@ groundsman at Reading . He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog 's life in the flat . Pounding music , people knocking on the door , girls throwing stones at the windows . Poor old sod . " 
 = = = = 1974 – 75 = = = = 
 Reading finished the 1973 – 74 season in sixth position , one place higher than the previous year . Friday underwent an operation to have tattoos removed from his fingers during the summer break , and afterwards joined a hippie commune in Cornwall , neglecting to inform Reading of this latter decision . He was absent without explanation when training started for the 1974 – 75 season in July 1974 , arriving only on the day of a closed @-@ doors friendly against Watford . Despite his lack of training , he far out @-@ performed the rest of the team . He continued to play well when the League programme began the following month . By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of First Division sides Sheffield United and Arsenal . The former had been following him since the game at Barnsley back in February , when he had still been an amateur . Arsenal manager Bertie Mee personally attended Reading 's 4 – 2 home win over Rotherham United on 12 September , but neither his team nor Sheffield United attempted to sign Friday . 
 After Reading despatched Newport County 3 – 0 on 14 September 1974 , Friday and his forward partner Dick <unk> had scored six goals each and topped the Football League goalscoring charts . However , at the same time Friday 's disciplinary record was becoming so bad that even the Evening Post , usually favourable to him , criticised him on 30 September 1974 , just after he had scored his first hat @-@ trick for Reading in a 4 – 1 victory over Southport . He was the Football League 's joint top scorer by this time with nine goals , but he had also already been booked three times that season and the Post argued that by constantly risking suspension he was letting the team down . Under the system then used , the three bookings gave him an automatic two @-@ match suspension . The article argued that missing games because of " completely unnecessary " and " stupid " infractions amounted to selling the club short . 
 Friday 's behaviour on Reading away trips was unpredictable and erratic : in the words of team @-@ mate John Murray , " Some of the things he did were funny but other times they were just mad " . On the way back from one away match , the team bus pulled over and Friday noticed that they were beside a cemetery . Friday jumped over the wall and stole some stone angels from a grave , intending to place them beside the club chairman Frank Waller , who was sleeping on the coach . When he returned , Hurley sternly told him that " you must never ever desecrate a graveyard " — Friday dutifully returned the statues . On another occasion , Friday reacted to the news that a team @-@ mate had smuggled a girl into his hotel room by kicking the door in . Later on the same night he walked into the bar carrying a swan that he had found in the hotel grounds . 
 During an FA Cup tie away against Swindon Town on 23 November , Friday began to have trouble breathing and despite leaving the game for five minutes to recuperate with an inhaler was eventually forced to come off for good , coughing violently . After recovering from what was reported to be a chest infection , he returned to the team on 28 December , having missed four matches , and marked his return with his side 's only goal in a 3 – 1 home defeat to Stockport County . Reading dropped to 12th place on 6 January 1975 , and were only three points above the re @-@ election places ; however , by the time they took on Workington at home on 3 February they had risen to 10th . Reading won 3 – 0 , with Friday scoring the third goal with a spectacular header : " Diving full length barely a foot off the ground , Friday risked life and limb to head home a truly memorable goal " , wrote the Evening Post match reporter . " True to form , he had to spoil things for himself by getting booked three minutes later " . 
 This victory marked the beginning of a run of six wins out of seven games , after which the side was once again challenging for promotion to the third tier , hovering between sixth and eighth place for the rest of the season . By 11 April promotion looked improbable , but Friday was still overjoyed after scoring the last @-@ minute winner in Reading 's 2 – 1 victory over Rochdale . In celebration he ran behind the net and kissed a policeman . " The policeman looked so cold and fed up standing there " , explained the Reading forward , publicly , " that I decided to cheer him up a bit . " In the dressing room after the game he said , privately , that he wished he hadn 't done it " because I hate coppers so much " . Reading eventually finished the 1974 – 75 season in seventh place , five points behind the promoted teams . Friday was the club 's top scorer for the season , with 18 league goals and 20 overall , and was voted its player of the year . 
 = = = = 1975 – 76 = = = = 
 Friday 's fine form continued into the 1975 – 76 season ; after their 4 – 2 victory over Hartlepool United on 23 September 1975 , Reading were top of the Fourth Division having just won four games in a row . Friday , meanwhile , was the club 's top scorer . The next game was against Bournemouth on the 27th , and although Reading won 2 – 1 Friday was sent off after 79 minutes . By this time the forward was overwhelmingly popular among Reading 's fans , to whom he endeared himself by performing a lap of honour after each goal he scored . A month later , after two wins , two defeats and a draw during October , the team was fourth in the table . 
 Friday was arrested after the evening match away at Newport County on 20 October , accused of using obscene language outside a Newport nightclub . At his appearance before magistrates in Newport on 17 November , he pleaded not guilty , representing himself , and was acquitted . Performing strongly for Reading and scoring regularly , he began to attract serious interest from other clubs . " Friday is , of course , much more than Reading 's top scorer and best striker " , wrote the Evening Post on 3 November 1975 . " He is the most vital cog in the team , and last week I understand Reading turned down a £ 60 @,@ 000 bid from Cardiff City involving Welsh international Derek Showers " . By the new year , Reading were third in the table , on course for promotion and two points behind league leaders Lincoln City . 
 After Reading went four games without a win starting on 24 January 1976 , a late goal from Friday ended this run on 25 February , in a home match against Hartlepool United ; twelve minutes from time , he collected a pass from Stewart Henderson and neatly placed the ball past the goalkeeper from the edge of the penalty area . " One is increasingly under the impression " , the Evening Post reported , " that if Friday was out for some time through injury the Reading team would fall to pieces " . Led by the free @-@ scoring Friday , the side continued its push for promotion ; fourth or higher would be enough to go up . A vital fixture on 31 March 1976 pitted fourth @-@ placed Reading at home against Tranmere Rovers , who occupied third spot ; internationally experienced referee Clive Thomas took charge of the game . Friday , who had already scored 18 goals that season , rose to the occasion with an effort that has been described by many sources as one of the greatest ever scored . 
 With the score 2 – 0 to Reading , the goalkeeper Steve Death threw the ball to the right back Gary Peters , who spotted Friday standing near the left @-@ hand corner of the opposing penalty area . Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward , who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal , about 25 – 30 yards away from the net . As Friday landed , he ferociously powered the ball towards goal , kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone . The shot flew straight into the top @-@ right @-@ hand corner of the net , stunning the crowd , players and Thomas , the referee , who put his hands over his head in disbelief . " I 'll never forget it " , Thomas recalled . " It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder . ... If it hadn 't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost . Even up against the likes of Pelé and Cruyff , that rates as the best goal I have ever seen . " Reading went on to win the game 5 – 0 . When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal , the Londoner replied , " Really ? You should come down here more often , I do that every week . " 
 Reading moved to within one point of promotion on 19 April 1976 with a 1 – 0 home victory over Brentford . Friday set up the game 's only goal , beating three players before hitting the post with his shot ; Ray <unk> scored from the rebound . Friday scored a powerful left @-@ footed volley during the first half of a 2 – 2 draw away against Cambridge United two days later . The result secured Third Division football for Reading . At the celebratory dinner after the game , the Reading captain Gordon Cumming saw some fluted wine glasses , and voiced his admiration : " I wouldn 't mind a few of them for home " , he said . " Give us a few minutes and I 'll get them for you " , replied Friday . Going around the dining room and picking them off the tables , he stole a whole <unk> of the glasses , which he managed to sneak out of the hotel and onto the team coach , but much to Cumming 's annoyance he then decided to keep them for himself . With 22 goals for the year , 21 in the league , Friday was once more Reading 's top goalscorer and for the second consecutive season the team 's player of the year . 
 After Reading were promoted , Waller met with the players on 4 June 1976 to discuss their contracts for the 1976 – 77 season . The wages offered to the Reading players were far lower than they had been expecting , causing the team 's morale to fall drastically . " We got screwed by the club " , midfielder Eamon Dunphy later claimed . " We didn 't get what we had been promised . " Friday was so offended by the low salary offered that he handed in a transfer request , telling the Evening Post that the club 's directors clearly did not share his ambition . " They would be happy to stroll along in the bottom half of the Third Division forever " , he said . The row over the new contracts continued throughout the off @-@ season , while Friday planned his second wedding ; he had been formally divorced from Maxine after years of separation , and subsequently engaged to Liza <unk> , a Reading @-@ born university graduate . After the pay dispute was settled on 5 August , the couple were married in Reading three days later . The wedding was filmed by Southern Television , before whose cameras Friday , wearing an open @-@ necked tiger @-@ skin @-@ pattern shirt , brown velvet suit and snakeskin boots , sat on the steps of the church and rolled a joint . Friday had invited about two hundred people , mostly friends and relatives from London , who joined in the drinking and drug @-@ taking and ending up fighting each other and stealing the couple 's wedding presents , one of which was a large quantity of cannabis . Liza later called the wedding " the most hilarious thing ever " . " I have been to a few weddings " , recalled Rod Lewington , " but never one like that . "

 " He lost his way when we got promotion " , Hurley later reflected . " He really must have celebrated all through the summer " . Friday reported back for pre @-@ season training in bad condition , and although Hurley claimed that Friday was trying hard to regain fitness , the forward was having trouble with his asthma , had lost some of his pace and was obviously unfit . Although his performances during August quickly improved , they were still not up to his previous standard and the Evening Post revealed on the 30th that Reading were preparing to sell him " to a First Division club " . After scoring in two successive Reading home wins on 4 and 7 September , against Walsall and Wrexham respectively , Friday took part in a third consecutive victory on the 13th , away against Northampton Town . After this he missed two matches , according to the Post because he was suffering from flu , and when he returned to the team was far from his best ; " Suddenly he had lost a yard and his control of the ball was not as good " , Hurley recalled . 
 Hurley was by now aware that his forward was using drugs , and attempted to keep his player 's habit a secret while he patiently worked to bring him back around . However , Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley 's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players , who became unsettled and complained about Friday 's conduct . The club became increasingly minded to sell him , but although top @-@ flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested , they were reluctant to buy because of Friday 's temperament ; in Downs 's words , " They weren 't sure they could handle him " . By the end of October 1976 , Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player , believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team . " The squad needs you but I owe it to the club because I can 't have you using drugs , " Hurley told Friday . " If I know you 're using drugs it won 't take them [ the major clubs ] long to find out . You have got to get your act together . " Friday was made available for transfer , at his own request , on 28 October . 
 Friday was watched by other clubs throughout November and December 1976 , but although he performed well in some games , including a 1 – 1 draw away at Crystal Palace on 6 November in which he scored his team 's only goal , he was poor in others . After being marked out of the game during Reading 's 4 – 0 loss away against Mansfield Town on 8 November , he was substituted . " Coincidence or not " , wrote the Evening Post , " when Friday left , so did half a dozen managers and scouts " . Friday was so angry at his team 's performance that he broke into the Mansfield dressing room and defecated in the team bath . Reading 's asking price stood at £ 50 @,@ 000 , and the first transfer offer came from Second Division side Cardiff City around mid @-@ December . Cardiff boss Jimmy Andrews bid £ 28 @,@ 000 , half of his offer a year before , which Reading 's directors accepted , wanting the troublesome player off their hands as quickly as possible . Friday was reluctant to go to the Welsh club , saying that it was too far from home , that he wanted to go to a First Division team and that he wanted more money than was being offered ; however , when Hurley told him that unless he went to Cardiff he would be released , he agreed and travelled to Wales on 30 December 1976 .

 On arrival at Cardiff Central railway station , Friday was arrested by the British Transport Police for having travelled from Reading with only a platform ticket . Andrews bailed his new player out of police custody and took him to Ninian Park to sign the contract . Despite the manner of Friday 's arrival , and although he knew there " had to be something wrong with him " , the Cardiff manager was still happy with his purchase , describing the £ 28 @,@ 000 transfer as " an absolute steal " . After a long night of drinking the night before his Cardiff debut , Friday lined up against Fulham on 1 January 1977 . The Fulham defence included former England captain Bobby Moore , but Friday marked his first match for the Welsh club with two goals ; he also squeezed Moore 's testicles during the game as Cardiff won 3 – 0 . Andrews was so happy with Friday 's performance that he phoned Hurley two days later , on Monday morning . " Oh , Charlie " , Andrews gushed , " he was magnificent . He tore them inside out . ... Moore was chasing him all over the place " . The Cardiff manager continued to heap praise on his new acquisition until Hurley finally stopped him . " Jimmy , you 've only had him four days " , he warned , <unk> : " Give it a few months " ... 
 Friday 's form declined after his strong debut and his personal life remained troubled and chaotic , leading him to vanish regularly and miss Cardiff matches . He was supposed to be living in Bristol , but his manager would often find on visiting his house that he had been elsewhere for weeks . Leslie Hamilton , the Cardiff club doctor , later said that he had believed at the time that Andrews was being far too soft on Friday ; indeed , according to team @-@ mate Paul Went , the forward would simply leave after each match and not be heard of until he returned for the next game . " He wouldn 't even bother to have a shower " , Went later said , in an interview . " He 'd just get dressed , take his carrier @-@ bag with his dry martini and he 'd go — no explanation " . 
 While Hurley had been able to command Friday 's respect , it soon became clear that Andrews was unable to control him and that the Londoner disliked his new manager . Indeed , soon after moving to Cardiff , Friday appeared one day in Hurley 's office at Elm Park asking to come back to Reading . " He still called me boss " , Hurley recalled . " I can 't play for that little bastard " , Friday told Hurley , referring to Andrews . " You 're the one who seems to be able to get me right . Can I come back to you ? " Hurley replied that although he would be happy to have Friday back on the team , the club could not afford to repay the £ 28 @,@ 000 transfer fee to Cardiff , so he would have to go back and continue playing there . Unhappy living so far from home , Friday began to travel back to London at weekends ; he avoided paying rail fares by knocking on locked toilet doors and shouting , " Tickets , please ! " , pretending to be the ticket inspector . When the occupant passed his ticket under the door to be checked , Friday would pick it up , walk off and use it for himself . Paul Went also recalled an incident during training when he had thrown a ball out from goal and accidentally hit Friday on the back of the head . A player standing near the forward started laughing , leading Friday to conclude that he had thrown the ball . Friday viciously punched the laughing player in the jaw , striking him with such force that he wore a neck brace for two weeks afterwards . 
 Late in Friday 's first season in Wales , Cardiff took on Luton Town on 16 April 1977 . Cardiff were in the relegation zone and had not won in seven games , while Luton were fifth in the table and challenging for promotion . After clashing repeatedly early in the match with Luton goalkeeper <unk> Aleksic , Friday was lectured by the referee for a high tackle on the goalkeeper in the 36th minute . Friday held out a hand to apologise , but Aleksic reacted angrily . When the free kick was taken , Friday ran back , stole the ball from Luton defender John Faulkner , broke away , rounded Aleksic and slotted the ball past him into the net . In celebration , Friday jogged back past the goalkeeper while giving him the V @-@ sign . Cardiff won the match 4 – 2 and at the end of the season avoided relegation to the third tier only on goal difference . Meanwhile , without Friday , Reading were relegated back to the Fourth Division by one point . Friday 's actions became even stranger during his time at Cardiff ; after they lost the second leg of the Welsh Cup final 3 – 0 to Shrewsbury Town on 18 May 1977 , the players and staff were awoken in the middle of the night by loud bangs coming from below their rooms . The cause was found to be Friday , standing on the hotel 's snooker table in his underpants and throwing the balls around the room in fury . 
 = = = = 1977 – 78 = = = = 
 After failing to turn up for pre @-@ season training with Cardiff before the 1977 – 78 season , Friday was reported to be in a London hospital suffering from an unknown virus which had caused him to lose 2 stone ( 13 kg ; 28 lb ) in weight . When he suddenly appeared in Cardiff for training in October , two months into the season , he claimed to have been suffering from hepatitis , but medical tests disproved this . Andrews told the local press that on arrival Friday had looked " like the fittest player in the world " , and hoping to avoid further disappearances persuaded a reluctant Friday to move from Bristol to Cardiff . The Londoner returned to the team for the away match at Brighton & Hove Albion on 29 October 1977 , with Cardiff once again in the relegation zone , in 20th place on goal difference . 
 Friday was marked during the game by Mark Lawrenson , who so frustrated the Cardiff forward with his close attention that Friday waited for Lawrenson to attempt a slide tackle and then kicked him in the face . After receiving a red card , Friday left the ground with the game still going on ; according to legend , before leaving he broke into the Brighton dressing room and defecated in Lawrenson 's kit bag . Cardiff eventually lost 4 – 0 . " I am sick and tired of it " , Andrews told the South Wales Echo on 1 November . " To be sent off in his first game back is as much as a man can stand " . Friday was transfer @-@ listed and served a three @-@ match suspension before making his final appearance on 10 December in Cardiff 's 6 – 3 away defeat against Bolton . Liza was by now the mother of Friday 's second daughter , Arabella , but around this time began divorce proceedings . Friday claimed that he had had enough of people telling him what to do , and walked into Andrews 's office on 20 December 1977 to announce that he was retiring from professional football . The club promptly released him and cancelled his contract . 
 = = Post @-@ retirement = = 
 After retiring , Friday moved back to London and returned to work as an asphalter and decorator . Soon after Friday left Cardiff , Reading manager Maurice Evans was presented with a petition , signed by 3 @,@ 000 supporters , requesting that he attempt to re @-@ sign Friday . Evans contacted Friday and told him : " If you would just settle down for three or four years , you could play for England " . Friday replied with the question " How old are you ? " , and after Evans answered , continued : " I 'm half your age and I 've lived twice your life " . Evans reflected , " You may well be right " . Friday trained with Brentford during the 1978 – 79 pre @-@ season , but after regaining his fitness suddenly changed his mind and stopped coming to training . He married for a third time in 1980 , but was divorced again within three years . After a short time living back with his parents in Acton , Friday 's family secured him a housing association flat in the area . He served a prison sentence during the 1980s for impersonating a police officer and confiscating people 's drugs , and was found dead in his Acton flat on 22 December 1990 at the age of 38 , having suffered a fatal heart attack . Biographer Paolo Hewitt claimed the incident to be the result of " a suspected heroin overdose " . 
 = = Style of play and legacy = = 
 Friday is often cited as an unsung talent . A latterly applied nickname , " the greatest footballer you never saw " , was used as the title of his 1997 biography , co @-@ written by Oasis bass player Paul McGuigan and Hewitt . Both as a player and a personality , Friday remains a major figure for both of his professional clubs . BBC Radio Berkshire Sports Editor Tim <unk> , speaking in 2010 , emphasised the importance of Friday 's charisma to his contemporary and retrospective appeal , a point which was also highlighted by his second wife , Liza , who likened his personal charm to that of " a pied piper " . In terms of significance to Reading F.C. , <unk> stated that Friday was the team 's " very own George Best " . Cardiff @-@ based band Super Furry Animals used a photograph of him giving the V @-@ sign to Aleksic in 1977 for the artwork of their 1996 single " The Man Don 't Give a Fuck " , which was dedicated to his memory " and his stand against the ' Man ' " . 
 After winning the title of " Player of the Millennium " from Reading in 1999 , he was voted the top " all @-@ time cult hero " for both Reading and Cardiff in a 2004 BBC poll ; with similar polls taking place at each Premier League and Football League club , he was the only player to appear in the top three for two different sides . In 2007 , a poll of fans run by Reading resulted in his once more being named the club 's best ever . Later that year , when the Professional Footballers ' Association ( PFA ) canvassed Reading supporters for their all @-@ time favourite , Friday won again . In a parallel PFA survey , Cardiff fans chose one of Friday 's former team @-@ mates , Wales international defender Phil Dwyer . Friday was ranked first in Channel 4 's list of football " bad boys " in August 2007 , while <unk> placed him at eighth place in a 2010 list of " wasted talents " . 
 Friday 's style of play was based around his exceptional ball skills , described by Cardiff doctor Leslie Hamilton as " absolutely fabulous " , and his instinctive footballing vision , which enabled him both to execute flamboyant individual moves and to create attacks for his team @-@ mates . Jimmy Andrews , his manager at Cardiff , later called Friday " the complete centre @-@ forward " and placed him on a par with Alan Shearer , while Maurice Evans claimed that he could have played for England , and was at least on a level with international strikers he had worked with such as John Aldridge and Dean Saunders . This opinion was shared by Hamilton and Friday 's Reading team @-@ mate John Murray , both of whom firmly declared in separate interviews that Friday would have been good enough for the England team had he " sorted his head out " , in Hamilton 's words . 
 A natural goalscoring forward , Friday was also unselfish and would take just as much pleasure out of setting up a goal scored by a team @-@ mate as netting one himself . He possessed fine ball control and dribbling skills , and could also shoot with both great power and sharp accuracy . The strong physical aspect of his game and exceptionally competitive , combative spirit combined with all of this to create a formidable forward player : such was his ability that his arrival transformed Reading into one of the division 's best sides in a matter of weeks . Writing in 2010 , Roger <unk> stressed Friday 's immediate and profound impact on the Reading team as a key factor in his lasting popularity : " It was like the comic @-@ book stories that kids from Robin 's era would have read " , he wrote . " He was a ready @-@ made star " . 
 On top of his technical talent , Friday was physically very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries . According to Hamilton , he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle . He boasted an exceptional work @-@ rate , which Dwyer recalled gave any side including him a strong boost : " When he was in the line @-@ up you 'd have a centre @-@ forward and a centre @-@ half ; not only would he be up there running them ragged , but when it broke down he 'd be the first person to start tackling back " . He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday 's attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game . Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday 's style of play as " really quite bizarre . It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying ' Give me the ball and I 'll see what I can do with it ' " . On receiving the ball , he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single @-@ handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a team @-@ mate . " We didn 't need anyone else up front " , Hurley later said . " They couldn 't get the ball off him . He was one of those guys who could beat five players easily " . Andrews agreed : " once he 'd got the ball it was almost impossible to get it off him " . 
 Friday was known for giving his all in any game in which he played , no matter the circumstances . Hurley later said that Friday would often become furious at his team @-@ mates for not trying their best , even in training . This strong drive to always win even extended to the use of physical intimidation to unsettle opposing players , leading contemporary critics to label him a " villain " . Friday also employed the use of psychological tactics ; aiming to spook opposing players , Friday would kiss them or fondle their testicles . Cardiff team @-@ mate Paul Went recalled that these tricks would " completely throw " defenders and affect their concentration . Although he was often criticised for the number of bookings and sendings @-@ off he received , Friday believed he was justified to chase victory by any means , explaining his attitude in a 1977 interview : " On the pitch I hate all opponents . I don 't give a damn about anyone . People think I 'm mad , a lunatic . I am a winner " .

 Development of Ant @-@ Man began in April 2006 , with the hiring of Wright to direct and co @-@ write with Cornish . By April 2011 , Wright and Cornish had completed three drafts of the script and Wright shot test footage for the film in July 2012 . Pre @-@ production began in October 2013 after being put on hold so that Wright could complete The World 's End . Casting began in December 2013 , with the hiring of Rudd to play Lang . In May 2014 , Wright left the project , citing creative differences , though he still received screenplay and story credits with Cornish , as well as an executive producer credit . The following month , Reed was brought in as Wright 's replacement , while McKay was hired to contribute to the script with Rudd .

 = = Plot = = 
 In 1989 , scientist Hank Pym resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering their attempt to replicate his Ant @-@ Man shrinking technology . Believing the technology is dangerous , Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives . 
 In the present day , Pym 's estranged daughter , Hope van Dyne , and former protégé , Darren Cross , have forced him out of his company , Pym Technologies . Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own , the Yellowjacket , which horrifies Pym . 
 Upon his release from prison , well @-@ meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate , Luis . Lang visits his daughter Cassie unannounced and is rebuked by his former wife Maggie and her police @-@ detective fiancé , Paxton , for not providing child support . Unable to hold a job because of his criminal record , Lang agrees to join Luis ' crew and commit a burglary . Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe , but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit , which he takes home . After trying the suit on , Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect . Terrified by the experience , he returns the suit to the house , but is arrested on the way out . Pym , the homeowner , visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out . 
 Pym , who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test , wants Lang to become the new Ant @-@ Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross . Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions , van Dyne helps Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants . While van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet 's death , he reveals that Janet , known as the Wasp , disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm while disabling a Soviet nuclear missile . Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit 's regulator . They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the Avengers ' headquarters , where he briefly fights Sam Wilson . 
 Cross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an unveiling ceremony at Pym Technologies ' headquarters . Lang , along with his crew and a swarm of flying ants , infiltrates the building during the event , sabotages the company 's servers , and plants explosives . When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket , he , along with Pym and Hope , are captured by Cross , who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant @-@ Man suits to Hydra . Lang breaks free and he and Hope dispatch most of the Hydra agents , though one flees with a vial of Cross ' particles and Pym is shot . Lang pursues Cross , while the explosives detonate , imploding the building as Pym and van Dyne escape . 
 Cross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is arrested by Paxton . Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight . Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross ' suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably , killing Cross . Lang disappears into the quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the macroscopic world . In gratitude for Lang 's heroism , Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison . Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm , Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well . Later , Lang meets up with Luis , who tells him that Wilson is looking for him . 
 In a mid @-@ credits scene , Pym shows van Dyne a new Wasp prototype suit and offers it to her . In a post @-@ credits scene , Wilson and Steve Rogers have Bucky Barnes in their custody . Unable to contact Tony Stark because of " the accords " , Wilson mentions that he knows someone who could help . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant @-@ Man : 
 A former systems engineer at <unk> and petty criminal who acquires a suit that allows him to shrink in size but increase in strength . Regarding Rudd 's casting , producer Kevin Feige said , " Look at that origin of the petty crook who comes into contact with a suit and does his best to make good , and then look at someone like Paul Rudd , who can do slightly unsavory things like break into people 's houses and still be charming and who you root for and whose redemption you will find satisfaction in . " Director Peyton Reed compared Lang to George Clooney 's character Danny Ocean from Ocean 's Eleven , saying , " He 's a guy trying to create a new life for himself and find redemption . " To get in shape for the role , Rudd worked with trainers and cut alcohol , fried foods , and carbohydrates out of his diet . Rudd stated that in preparation for his role , he " basically didn 't eat anything for about a year ... I took the Chris Pratt approach to training for an action movie . <unk> anything fun for a year and then you can play a hero . " Rudd signed a multi @-@ film contract with Marvel , with Feige saying it was " three [ films ] -plus @-@ plus to appear in other things . " 
 Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne : 
 The daughter of Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne and a senior board member of Pym Technologies , who helps Darren Cross take over the company . Throughout the film , character progression brings Hope closer to becoming a hero ; with the end of the film showing Hank give his daughter a prototype Wasp suit , allowing her to take on the mantle from her mother . Lily described her character as " capable , strong , and kick @-@ ass " , but said that being raised by two superheroes resulted in Hope being " a pretty screwed up human being ... and the clear message sent by my name is that I 'm not a big fan of my father and so I took my mother 's name . " She added that van Dyne 's " arc in the movie is trying to find a relationship " with Pym . Originally cast by Wright , Lilly was reluctant to take the role after he left the project until she read the revised script and got a chance to meet with Reed . Feige said that van Dyne was the more obvious choice to take up the mantle of Ant @-@ Man , being " infinitely more capable of actually being a superhero " than Lang , and that the reason she does not is because of Pym 's experience with losing her mother , rather than sexism , which Feige felt would not be a problem for Pym in modern times . Lilly signed a multi @-@ film contract with Marvel . 
 Corey Stoll as Darren Cross / Yellowjacket : 
 A former protégé of Pym 's , who takes over his mentor 's company and <unk> a similar version of the Ant @-@ Man technology to create the Yellowjacket suit . Stoll described the suit as " the next generation of Ant @-@ Man 's suit " , with a sleeker , more militaristic look as " if Apple had designed a battle suit . " As for his character , Stoll said that Cross was more like Hank Pym than " Thanos or Loki , who are villains that know it " , since Cross is a " brilliant scientist , who is not ethically pure " with shades of gray . Unlike Rudd , who wore a practical costume as Ant @-@ Man , Stoll wore a motion capture suit while performing as Yellowjacket . Reed explained that this decision was made early on when creating and filming with a real Yellowjacket costume was found to be impractical . 
 Bobby Cannavale as Paxton : 
 An SFPD officer who is engaged to Lang 's former wife Maggie . Cannavale stated that Rudd and McKay convinced him to join the film during the rewriting process before Marvel approached him , saying , " They sort of pumped [ my ] part up a bit ... I really went on good faith [ taking the role ] because they 're so secretive [ at Marvel ] about the script . I just trusted them . " He also added that the process felt like an indie film instead of a large @-@ scale blockbuster , and that he was able to improvise frequently along with the other actors . Patrick Wilson was originally cast in the role , before leaving the film because of scheduling conflicts brought on by the filming delay . 
 Michael Peña as Luis : 
 Lang 's former cellmate and a member of his crew . Peña stated that he modeled Luis ' vocal style and positive outlook on life " on a friend of a friend " , saying , " That 's just the way he talks and the cadence . He 's got this grin on the entire time and he doesn 't care . He 's the kind of guy where you 're like ' Hey , what 'd you do this weekend ? ' and he 's like ' I went to jail , <unk> , ' with a smile on his face . Not a lot of people do that . Not a lot of people think of life on those terms . " Peña signed a contract with Marvel for three films . 
 Tip " T.I. " Harris as Dave : 
 A member of Lang 's crew . Harris described Dave as Lang 's " homeboy " . Harris also revealed that he was not permitted to read the entire script , explaining " You 're just handed scenes as the film [ went ] along , and when you do that , it 's like a blank canvas , ' This is what I 'm going to do for this scene , ' and you can remember previous performances and remain consistent with that . The energy created by the ensemble you have around you , it contributes to the outlook or the final view of what your character has become , and what he meant to the story . " 
 Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon : 
 An Avenger who is a former pararescueman trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack . On including Falcon , Reed said that it was not done just to include the character , rather " [ i ] t served a plot point ; a purpose in our story " and allowed them to enhance Peña 's " tip montages " , which were written by production writers Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer , also adding Falcon " seemed like the right character — not a marquee character like Iron Man or Thor , but the right level of hero . " Rudd and McKay decided to include Falcon after watching Captain America : The Winter Soldier . 
 Wood Harris as Gale : A police officer and Paxton 's partner . 
 Judy Greer as Maggie : Lang 's estranged former wife . 
 David Dastmalchian as Kurt : 
 A member of Lang 's crew . Dastmalchian , who is American , worked with actress <unk> <unk> to learn how to speak in his character 's Russian accent . On his character , Dastmalchian said that he " had this idea that Kurt was born and raised in a town even further out than Siberia and he was just an amazing computer wizard who fell in with the wrong people . But he was obsessed with two things : Saturday Night Fever and Elvis Presley , hence the polyester shirts unbuttoned too far and the hair in that pompadour . " 
 Michael Douglas as Hank Pym : 
 A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent , entomologist , and physicist , who became the original Ant @-@ Man in 1963 after discovering the subatomic particles that make the transformation possible . He later mentors Lang to take over the role . Douglas compared his decision to join a superhero film to his role in Behind the Candelabra saying , " Sometimes — like [ when ] they didn 't see you for Liberace — you 've got to shake them up a little bit and have some fun . " Describing Pym , Douglas said , " He 's sort of a Northern California , formal guy . He 's lost control of his company . He lives in sort of a time warp . He was always a bit of a tinkerer . He 's got a lab , plus a lot of other stuff , in his basement that we find out about . He 's certainly bitter about what happened with his company and deeply scared of what the future might hold — because he himself , after having gotten small so many times , it 's difficult . He looks and tries to find a guy that he can work with and has the right characteristics , which is [ Scott ] . " Douglas indicated that he would not be wearing the Ant @-@ Man suit . 
 Additionally , John Slattery and Hayley Atwell reprise their roles as Howard Stark and Peggy Carter , respectively , from previous MCU media . Slattery stated that his involvement in Ant @-@ Man was " not that much more " than his participation in Iron Man 2 , while Atwell described her appearance as being " more of a cameo " . Abby Ryder Fortson portrays Cassie , the daughter of Lang and Maggie ; Gregg <unk> appears as Dale , the manager of a Baskin @-@ Robbins store ; and Martin Donovan plays Mitchell Carson , a former member of S.H.I.E.L.D. who works for Hydra and looks to purchase the Yellowjacket technology .

 = = = Development = = = 
 Development of an Ant @-@ Man film began as early as the late 1980s , when Ant @-@ Man co @-@ creator Stan Lee pitched the idea to New World Entertainment , Marvel Comics ' parent company at the time . However , Walt Disney Pictures was developing a film based on a similar concept , Honey , I Shrunk the Kids , and although Ant @-@ Man went into development , nothing came to fruition . 
 In 2000 , Howard Stern met with Marvel in an attempt to purchase the film rights to Ant @-@ Man . In May of that year , Artisan Entertainment announced a deal with Marvel to <unk> , finance , and distribute a film based on Ant @-@ Man . In 2003 , Edgar Wright and his writing partner Joe Cornish wrote a treatment for Artisan , with Wright explaining that it revolved around Scott Lang as a burglar " so he could have gone slightly in the Elmore Leonard route " , though Artisan wanted the film to be " like a family thing " . However , Wright believed that the treatment was never sent to Marvel . A year later , the duo pitched the film to Marvel Studios ' then head of production , Kevin Feige . In April 2006 , Marvel Studios hired Wright to direct Ant @-@ Man as part of the company 's first slate of independently produced films , buoyed by a $ 525 million revolving film @-@ financing facility . Wright also signed to co @-@ write the screenplay with Cornish , based on a comic book series about an electronics expert who can shrink to the size of an insect and communicate with ants via telepathic / cybernetic helmet , and to co @-@ produce the film with his Big Talk Productions partner , Nira Park . 
 At the 2006 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International , Wright said he was intrigued by the story 's high concept and character . Wright also stressed that the film would not be a spoof but an action @-@ adventure with some comedic elements and would incorporate both the Hank Pym and Scott Lang incarnations of the character . Wright said that he was looking to " do a prologue where you see Pym as Ant @-@ Man in action in the 60 's , in sort of Tales to Astonish mode basically , and then the contemporary , sort of flash @-@ forward , is Scott Lang 's story , and how he comes to acquire the suit , how he crosses paths with Hank Pym , and then , in an interesting sort of Machiavellian way , teams up with him . " The next February , Wright said that the project was in " a holding pattern " while the script was being revised , and that he had been doing research for the film by studying nanotechnology . In March 2008 , Wright said that the first draft of the script had been completed and he was working on the second . 
 Stan Lee tweeted in February 2010 that Marvel was prepping the film and that he met with Wright for lunch to discuss the character . Wright noted that there was no timetable for the film because Marvel did not consider the character to be one of their bigger , tentpole properties , so " It 's more like me and Kevin Feige saying ... ' Let 's make a good script that works , that 's all about a great genre film , and that isn 't necessarily relying on anything else ' " . At the 2010 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International , Wright said that Ant @-@ Man would not fit in the chronology of The Avengers due to the origin story he had written not working in the MCU . In January 2011 , Wright stated that he had resumed writing the script for the film following the conclusion of the international promotion for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World , and by April he and Cornish delivered the second draft of Ant @-@ Man to Marvel . At the 2011 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International , Wright revealed a third draft had been handed in . 
 In May 2012 , Feige said that the project was " as close as it 's ever been " while Wright teased the film by tweeting a pictogram of Ant @-@ Man . In June , Wright spent just under a week shooting footage for a reel that would be used to test out the potential look and tone of his movie , as well as to decide how convincing Ant @-@ Man 's powers look on screen . The test footage was screened to audiences during the Marvel Studios panel at the 2012 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International , with Wright confirming that Ant @-@ Man would be happening . Germain Lussier of / Film felt the footage worked and was " awesome " , as " it had a totally different vibe from the other Marvel films . It was much more like something you 'd recognize from Hot Fuzz . " Lussier , along with Katy Rich of <unk> , also enjoyed the costume design choice . That October , Disney scheduled the film for release on November 6 , 2015 . 
 Feige stated in January 2013 that Ant @-@ Man would in fact be part of Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe , and indicated in May that the screenplay needed to be modified in order to fit into the universe , as the project had been in development before the first Iron Man film . Feige also stated that shooting was slated to begin sometime in 2014 , and that casting would begin towards the end of 2013 . In July 2013 , Wright said that he and Cornish had completed the script for the film and that Marvel allowed him to delay its production so that he could complete The World 's End , as that film 's producer Eric Fellner was diagnosed with cancer . 
 In August 2013 , after Joss Whedon , director of Avengers : Age of Ultron , announced that Hank Pym would not be Ultron 's creator , Wright said Ultron was never a part of the story of Ant @-@ Man , explaining that " just to sort of set up what Ant @-@ Man does is enough for one movie " . Wright described Ant @-@ Man as a stand @-@ alone film but said it would fit into to the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe , explaining , " I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time . I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world , which is why I think Iron Man really works because it 's a relatively simple universe ; it 's relatable . I definitely want to go into finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it . " Wright also stated that pre @-@ production for Ant @-@ Man would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014 . The next month , Disney moved the film 's release date up to July 31 , 2015 . 
 = = = Pre @-@ production = = = 
 In October 2013 , Wright revealed that he was in Los Angeles to work on Ant @-@ Man by tweeting a photograph from the production of the June 2012 test reel . Joseph Gordon @-@ Levitt and Paul Rudd were soon being considered for the lead role , though Gordon @-@ Levitt dismissed his consideration as a rumor . Feige stated that Ant @-@ Man would be a " heist movie " , and that a casting announcement for Hank Pym would come before the end of 2013 . The next month , Feige stated that Eric O 'Grady 's Ant @-@ Man would not be featured in the film , while Rudd became the front @-@ runner to play Hank Pym , and casting for the character 's girlfriend had begun . Around that time , the filmmakers ' intentions to shoot in the United Kingdom were dashed because of a lack of studio space , which Wright believed was due to the plan by Pinewood Shepperton to add fifteen studios to their facility , which was rejected in part by the local council in May 2013 because the project was eyeing protected land . By the end of the month , the film was scheduled to be shot in the U.S. instead . 
 In December 2013 , Wright , a fan of the comic book since childhood — owning copies of Tales to Astonish # 27 featuring the " The Man in the Ant @-@ Hill " storyline and Marvel Premiere # 47 featuring the first appearance of Scott Lang — stated that the difference between Ant @-@ Man and other films featuring size @-@ changing is " other shrinking movies are usually about somebody trapped small . This is different in that he can actually change size and he can do that at will , so it becomes more of a power than an impediment . " Wright also talked about the challenge of directing a superhero film , saying , " Shaun and Hot Fuzz and World 's End are all R @-@ rated films . I like the challenge of making a PG @-@ 13 film . Because you 've got to entertain in a different way . You don 't have the same tools . " By December 19 , Rudd was in negotiations to star in the film , and Marvel announced that he had been cast as Ant @-@ Man the next day . 
 In January 2014 , Wright posted a screenshot on his blog from the Avengers : Earth 's Mightiest Heroes episode " To Steal an Ant @-@ Man " , which features Hank Pym and introduces the Scott Lang character , with the caption " homework " . Michael Douglas was subsequently cast as Pym , with Rudd confirmed to play Lang . Michael Peña was offered an unspecified role in the film , and filming was scheduled to take place at Pinewood Atlanta in Fayette County , Georgia , while Disney changed the release date once again , moving the film up to July 17 , 2015 . The next month , Evangeline Lilly entered early talks to portray the female lead , and Wright announced on his blog that Bill Pope , who he worked with on Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and The World 's End , would be his director of photography . By March , Wright and Cornish turned in a fifth draft of the script , amid alleged disputes on the direction the script was taking . As well , Wright and Cornish wrote a scene intended for the post @-@ credits of Avengers : Age of Ultron that would have acted as a prelude to the film . Corey Stoll entered negotiations for an undisclosed role in the film , and by April , Patrick Wilson and Matt Gerald were cast in undisclosed roles . 
 On May 23 , 2014 , Marvel and Wright jointly announced that Wright was leaving the project due to " differences in their vision of the film " , and that the studio was closing in on a new director . Pope also left the project in the wake of Wright 's departure . By May 30 , Adam McKay had entered negotiations to replace Wright , but pulled out of negotiations the next day . On June 7 , Marvel announced that Peyton Reed would direct the film , with McKay contributing to the film 's script . Other directors that had been under consideration include Ruben Fleischer , Rawson Marshall Thurber , Nicholas Stoller , Michael Dowse , and David Wain . 
 Later in June , Feige stated the film was still intended to be released on the July 17 , 2015 date , with production slated to begin on August 18 , 2014 . Feige elaborated that " much of the movie will still be based very much on [ Wright and Cornish 's ] draft and the DNA of what Edgar has created up to this point " , with Reed stepping in to direct and McKay reworking only parts of the script . " [ Reed ] wanted to be sure that he wasn 't just inheriting something or following someone else 's lead . Or wasn 't inheriting something that the evil studio had watered down to be something bad , " Feige continued . " He looked at everything , he talked with us , and he said ' Number one , I agree with the direction you 're going in . And number two , I can add to it . ' " 
 McKay stated that Rudd helped him rewrite the script , calling Rudd " great with dialogue " , adding " the two of us holed up in hotel rooms on the east and west coast , and I think it was like six to eight weeks we just ground it out and did a giant rewrite of the script . I was really proud of what we did , I really thought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just enhanced some stuff . " Rudd elaborated , " The idea , the trajectory , the goal , and the blueprint of it all , is really Edgar and Joe . It 's their story . We changed some scenes , we added new sequences , we changed some characters , we added new characters . If you took the two scripts and held them up together they 'd be very different — but the idea is all theirs . " Reed also offered contributions to the revised script , as did Lilly and Stoll , who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters . Lilly 's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result . One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more , given the Wasp being " a crucial part " of the Ant @-@ Man comics . For their efforts , McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay , with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story . Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film . 
 By the end of July , Wilson left the film because of scheduling conflicts brought on by the filming delay , and characters being played by Gerald and Kevin Weisman were cut in McKay 's revised script . Also , Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia , filming would take place in San Francisco . The next month , Reed revealed that Scott Lang 's daughter would appear in the film , and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make further revisions to the script . After reading the revised script , Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was " pulled " more into the MCU than Wright 's version which " was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films . " She added that , while Wright 's version was " incredible " and would have been great to film and watch , " it wouldn 't have fit in the Marvel Universe . It would have stuck out like a sore thumb , no matter how good it was . It just would have taken you away from this cohesive universe they 're trying to create . And therefore it ruins the suspended disbelief that they 've built . " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography began on August 18 , 2014 in San Francisco , under the working title Bigfoot . Scenes were shot in the Tenderloin neighborhood and Buena Vista Park . By the end of September 2014 , production on Ant @-@ Man moved to Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County , Georgia , and David <unk> completed a rewrite of the film . Filming also took place at the State Archives building in Downtown Atlanta , to double as Pym Technologies , which is located on Treasure Island , San Francisco in the film . In October 2014 , Martin Donovan was added to the cast , and Feige revealed that Ant @-@ Man would no longer start Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and would instead be the final film of Phase Two . When told by / Film 's Germain Lussier that this placement between Avengers : Age of Ultron and Captain America : Civil War made the film feel like an afterthought , Feige replied , 
 It 's not [ an after thought ] . The truth is the phases mean a lot to me and some people but ... Civil War is the start of Phase Three . It just is . And Ant @-@ Man is a different kind of culmination of Phase Two because it very much is in the MCU . You meet new characters and you learn about Hank Pym and his lineage with the MCU over the years . But at the same time , it also picks up the thread of Age of Ultron in terms of heroes — major heroes , Avengers — coming from unexpected places ... And in that way it connects a lot . Also , Hank Pym 's attitude towards Avengers , towards S.H.I.E.L.D. , and kind of the cinematic universe in general , is much more informed after the events of Age of Ultron , and in a certain way , before the events of Civil War . 
 Feige later expanded on this by saying , " [ W ] e put Ant @-@ Man at the end of Phase Two as opposed to the beginning of Phase Three , because it sets up a lot of the things you 're going to see heading into Phase Three , one of which is this mind @-@ bending , reality @-@ altering landscape [ in Doctor Strange ] . " On December 5 , 2014 , Reed announced on social media that principal photography on Ant @-@ Man had been completed . 
 For the film , cinematographer Russell Carpenter used a 1 @.@ 85 aspect ratio shot with Arri Alexa XT and M cameras , using the M for fight sequences and helicopter filming . Camera operator Peter Rosenfeld said , " Russell and Peyton 's decision to shoot in 1 @.@ 85 was a good call , since at 2 @.@ 35 there 's insufficient height in frame to appreciate the vertical aspects of [ Ant @-@ Man ] going from standing full @-@ size to falling through a crack in the floor . " Carpenter and Technicolor also devised a lookup table ( LUT ) to darken the color palette . Carpenter said , " For a lot of recent comedies I 've kept my <unk> kind of ' Kodak ' – saturated and upbeat . But this show needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant @-@ Man suit , which dates back to the 1980s , so it looks a little run @-@ down . What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from fire @-@ engine red to something a little more weathered . " 
 The filmmakers made extensive use of macro photography . Production designer Shepherd Frankel said , " It 's more visually interesting to depict things from Ant @-@ Man 's point of view instead of seeing him from a normal perspective . But we wanted a realistic realization , not Honey , I Shrunk the Kids with its oversized set pieces . " Rebecca Baehler served as the director of macro photography , taking cues from Carpenter . Carpenter said vibration became " a tremendous problem " when moving the camera during the macro photography because " one inch off the ground is like fifteen feet in the air . From an ant 's perspective , you move four inches , to a human perspective , that 's a football field ! " The solution required the filmmakers to search for a creative solution , so they turned to Baehler , who had a background in commercial " tabletop " photography . In order to add Rudd 's performance as Ant @-@ Man when in the macro world , a <unk> facial capture set up was used , with a five @-@ camera array of <unk> surrounding Rudd . Rosenfeld explained , " One camera was set up vertically while the others were horizontal with overlapping image areas , all set to record at 48 frames per second . This maximized resolution and provided 3D modeling [ of ] Paul 's performance . " Reed would then call out story moments with Rudd performing " facial expressions that would later be composited on a CG Ant @-@ Man . "

 Following the completion of principal photography , Marvel released an updated synopsis revealing that Jordi Mollà was included in the cast and the names of several supporting characters . However , Mollà subsequently did not appear in the theatrical release of the film . Reed explained that the film 's original opening , which was filmed and cut in the editing process , featured a standalone sequence similar to the opening of a James Bond film , where an unseen Pym was attempting to retrieve some microfilm from Mollà 's character , Castillo , a Panama army general . Reed stated the scene was going to show Ant @-@ Man 's powers , without seeing him , almost " like an Invisible Man sequence , and it 's really , really cool . It started to feel tonally disconnected from the movie we were making and story @-@ wise , and it also kind of like , it set a standalone adventure , but it didn ’ t just connect to the rest of our story ... It felt like vestige of those earlier drafts [ by Wright and Cornish ] , which as a standalone thing was really cool . " Dan <unk> and Colby Parker , Jr. served as film editors . In March 2015 , Hayley Atwell confirmed that she would reprise her role as Peggy Carter in the film . In April 2015 , Reed stated that the film was not completed yet and would be undergoing " a little bit of additional " filming . 
 In June 2015 , Feige confirmed that the character of Janet van Dyne would be seen , though the film would not address Pym and van Dyne 's infamous domestic abuse storyline in the comics , saying , " We hint at a temper in a way that people who know the stories might go , ' Oh , perhaps that 's a bit of [ Hank 's ] character , ' but not in a way that would ever indicate [ he beat his wife ] . " Also in the month , Reed confirmed there would be a post @-@ credit sequence " that may tie into the other films . " Feige revealed the post @-@ credit sequence was footage shot by Anthony and Joe Russo for Captain America : Civil War , saying the clip would be seen in that film , though it may be " different takes ... different angles . " On June 25 , 2015 , Reed announced on social media that production of Ant @-@ Man was officially complete . In early July 2015 , an international teaser trailer revealed that Anthony Mackie would appear in the film as Sam Wilson / Falcon . Mackie appears in the post @-@ credit sequence as well , along with Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan as Steve Rogers / Captain America and Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier , respectively . Stan stated the scene that was used for the post @-@ credit sequence was shot in May 2015 , and would appear in the middle of Civil War . Also in the month , Reed revealed that the quantum realm in the film was the MCU 's version of the <unk> , and that the end of the film originally had a sequence where Ant @-@ Man went after Carson to retrieve the stolen vial of Cross ' particles , " ... But then for a couple reasons , it felt like maybe we should leave those particles out there . " For the title sequences , Marvel again went with design firm Sarofsky , who had done the credits for both Captain America : The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy , with the credits " intricately connected to the film 's overall narrative . " 
 Visual effects for the film were provided by Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) , Lola VFX , Double Negative , Luma Pictures , and Method Studios , with previsualization by The Third Floor . Double Negative handled the scenes featuring shrunken characters , incorporating the macro photography and motion capture performances shot in principal photography with digital models of the characters . Double Negative also worked on Ant @-@ Man 's shrinking effect , in coordination with ILM to be used by all vendors , which showed the outline of his body – an element from the comics . Visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said , " It 's like a little time echo . As Ant @-@ Man shrinks in almost a stop motion way he would leave behind outlines of the poses he 'd been in as he shrinks down ... We 'd have two CG cameras rendering the action from different points along the timeline with slightly different framings . One would be the main shot camera , the other would be a utility camera that would provide renders of static poses of Ant @-@ Man at different points along the timeline . " 
 For the flashbacks in 1989 , Douglas and Donovan appeared de @-@ aged via CGI , alongside Atwell as Carter ( aged in makeup and with CGI ) and John Slattery as Howard Stark . To de @-@ age Douglas , Lola VFX used a similar process and technology that was used to make Steve Rogers skinny in Captain America : The First Avenger and Carter older in Captain America : The Winter Soldier as well as footage of Douglas ' other films from the late 1980s as reference . Dax Griffin served as Douglas ' body double and an additional reference for Lola , because of his " striking resemblance of Michael when he was about 40 " . For Donovan , he only needed to be de @-@ aged about a decade , so no double was used . The work on him focused on his eyes , neck , and chin . Atwell wore a wig on set , along with a fine layer of latex makeup to give the skin a more leathery look , with Lola transposing the facial features of an elderly actress onto the face of Atwell . 
 Method and Luma both worked on creating the various ants seen in the film , with Method creating the several species of ants , to share among the vendors . Luma also handled many of the scenes at Pym Technologies when Ant @-@ Man attempts to acquire the Yellowjacket . ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence , having done Falcon visual effects in The Winter Soldier . Using practical suit pieces built by Legacy Effects , ILM mixed live @-@ action shots with digital take @-@ overs and fully digital shots to create the sequence . ILM also handled the sequences in the quantum realm , providing an array of microscopic and largely psychedelic imagery for the subatomic shrinking , taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering techniques the studio had utilized on Lucy .

 In February 2014 , Wright tweeted that Steven Price would score the film . However , Price left soon after Wright 's departure from the project in May 2014 . In January 2015 , Christophe Beck , who worked with Reed on Bring It On , was hired to replace Price . Describing the film 's score , Beck said , " For Ant @-@ Man , I wanted to write a score in the grand symphonic tradition of my favorite superhero movies , with a sweeping scope and a big , catchy main theme . What makes this score stand out among other Marvel movies , though , is a sneaky sense of fun since it is , after all , not only a superhero movie , but also a heist comedy . " Hollywood Records released the soundtrack digitally on July 17 , 2015 , and had a physical release on August 7 .
