 Pratchett died at his home on the morning of 12 March 2015 from his Alzheimer 's , according to his publisher . The Telegraph reported an unidentified source as saying that despite his previous discussion of assisted suicide , his death had been natural . After Pratchett 's death , his assistant , Rob Wilkins , wrote from the official Terry Pratchett Twitter account : 
 AT LAST , SIR <unk> , WE MUST WALK <unk> . 
 Terry took Death 's arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night . 
 The End . 
 The use of small capitals is a reference to how the character of Death speaks in Pratchett 's works . 
 Many public figures paid tribute following Pratchett 's death , including British Prime Minister David Cameron and the comedian Ricky Gervais , and authors including Nick Harkaway , Ursula Le Guin , Terry Brooks , Margaret Atwood , George R. R. Martin , and Neil Gaiman . Pratchett was memorialised in a graffito in East London , and the video game company Frontier Developments added a space station to Elite : Dangerous named " Pratchett 's Disc " . Developers of Dota 2 , Valve Corporation , added an item to their game called " <unk> Core , " in reference to Pratchett 's novel " The Colour of Magic . " Users of the social news site Reddit organised a tribute by which an HTTP header , " X @-@ <unk> @-@ Overhead : GNU Terry Pratchett " , is added to a site 's responses , a reference to the Discworld novel Going Postal . 
 Pratchett 's humanist funeral service was held on 25 March 2015 .

 Pratchett started to use computers for writing as soon as they were available to him . His first computer was a Sinclair ZX81 ; the first computer he used properly for writing was an Amstrad CPC 464 , later replaced by a PC . Pratchett was one of the first authors routinely to use the Internet to communicate with fans , and was a contributor to the Usenet newsgroup <unk> from 1992 . However , he did not consider the Internet a hobby , just another " thing to use " . He had many computers in his house , with a bank of six monitors rigged up to ease writing . When he travelled , he always took a portable computer with him to write . 
 His experiments with computer upgrades are reflected in Hex . 
 Pratchett was also an avid video game player , and collaborated in the creation of a number of game adaptations of his books . He favoured games that are " intelligent and have some depth " , citing Half @-@ Life 2 and fan missions from Thief as examples . Additionally , he played Oblivion , which he described as " wonderful " , and used many of its non @-@ combat @-@ oriented , fan @-@ made mods . He is also said to have enjoyed playing the first Tomb Raider game .

 Pratchett was a trustee for the Orangutan Foundation UK but was pessimistic about the animal 's future .

Following Pratchett 's lead , fan events such as the Discworld Conventions have adopted the Orangutan Foundation as their nominated charity , which has been acknowledged by the foundation . One of Pratchett 's most popular fictional characters , the Librarian of the Unseen University 's Library , is a wizard who was transformed into an orangutan in a magical accident and decides to remain in that condition as it is so convenient for his work .

 Pratchett received a knighthood for " services to literature " in the 2009 UK New Year Honours list . He was previously appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire , also for " services to literature " , in 1998 . Following this , Pratchett commented in the <unk> SF / fan newsletter , " I suspect the ' services to literature ' consisted of refraining from trying to write any , " but added , " Still , I cannot help feeling mightily chuffed about it . "

 Pratchett won the British Science Fiction Award in 1989 for his novel , Pyramids , and a Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 2008 for Making Money .

 Pratchett received the NESFA Skylark Award in 2009 and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2010 . In 2011 he won Margaret A. Edwards Award from the American Library Association , a lifetime honour for " significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature " . The librarians cited nine Discworld novels published from 1983 to 2004 and observed that " Pratchett 's tales of Discworld have won over generations of teen readers with intelligence , heart , and undeniable wit . Comic adventures that fondly mock the fantasy genre , the Discworld novels expose the hypocrisies of contemporary society in an intricate , ever @-@ expanding universe . With satisfyingly multilayered plots , Pratchett 's humor honors the intelligence of the reader . Teens eagerly lose themselves in a universe with no maps . " 
 He was made an adjunct Professor in the School of English at Trinity College Dublin in 2010 , with a role in postgraduate education in creative writing and popular literature .

 Pratchett 's Discworld novels have led to dedicated conventions , the first in Manchester in 1996 , then worldwide , often with the author as guest of honour . Publication of a new novel was sometimes accompanied by an international book signing tour ; queues were known to stretch outside the bookshop as the author continued to sign books well after the intended finishing time . His fans were not restricted by age or gender , and he received a large amount of fan mail from them . Pratchett enjoyed meeting fans and hearing what they think about his books , saying that since he was well paid for his novels , his fans were " everything " to him . 
 = = Writing = = 
 Pratchett said that to write , you must read extensively , both inside and outside your chosen genre and to the point of " overflow " . He advised that writing is hard work , and that writers must " make grammar , punctuation and spelling a part of your life . " However , Pratchett enjoyed writing , regarding its monetary rewards as " an unavoidable consequence " , rather than the reason for writing . 
 = = = Fantasy genre = = = 
 Although during his early career he wrote for the sci @-@ fi and horror genres , Pratchett later focused almost entirely on fantasy , and said : " It is easier to bend the universe around the story . " In the acceptance speech for his Carnegie Medal he said : " Fantasy isn 't just about wizards and silly wands . It 's about seeing the world from new directions " , pointing to J. K. Rowling 's Harry Potter novels and J. R. R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings . In the same speech , he acknowledged benefits of these works for the genre . 
 Pratchett believed he owed " a debt to the science fiction / fantasy genre which he grew up out of " and disliked the term " magical realism " which , he said , is " like a polite way of saying you write fantasy and is more acceptable to certain people ... who , on the whole , do not care that much . " He expressed annoyance that fantasy is " <unk> as a literary form " , arguing that it " is the oldest form of fiction " ; he described himself as " infuriated " when novels containing science fiction or fantasy ideas were not regarded as part of those genres . He debated this issue with novelist A. S. Byatt and critic Terry Eagleton , arguing that fantasy is fundamental to the way we understand the world and therefore an integral aspect of all fiction . 
 On 31 July 2005 , Pratchett criticised media coverage of Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling , commenting that certain members of the media seemed to think that " the continued elevation of J. K. Rowling can be achieved only at the expense of other writers " . Pratchett later denied claims that this was a swipe at Rowling , and said that he was not making claims of plagiarism , but was pointing out the " shared heritage " of the fantasy genre . Pratchett also posted on the Harry Potter newsgroup about a media @-@ covered exchange of views with her . 
 = = = Style and themes = = = 
 Pratchett is known for a distinctive writing style that included a number of characteristic hallmarks . One example is his use of footnotes , which usually involve a comic departure from the narrative or a commentary on the narrative , and occasionally have footnotes of their own . 
 Pratchett 's earliest Discworld novels were written largely to parody classic sword @-@ and @-@ sorcery fiction ( and occasionally science @-@ fiction ) ; as the series progressed , Pratchett dispensed with parody almost entirely , and the Discworld series evolved into straightforward ( though still comedic ) satire . 
 Pratchett had a tendency to avoid using chapters , arguing in a Book Sense interview that " life does not happen in regular chapters , nor do movies , and Homer did not write in chapters " , adding " I 'm blessed if I know what function they serve in books for adults . " However , there have been exceptions ; Going Postal and Making Money and several of his books for younger readers are divided into chapters . Pratchett offered explanations for his sporadic use of chapters ; in the young adult titles , he said that he must use chapters because ' [ his ] editor screams until [ he ] does ' , but otherwise felt that they were an unnecessary ' stopping point ' that got in the way of the narrative . 
 Characters , place names , and titles in Pratchett 's books often contain puns , allusions and culture references . Some characters are parodies of well @-@ known characters : for example , Pratchett 's character Cohen the Barbarian , also called <unk> Cohen , is a parody of Conan the Barbarian and Genghis Khan , and his character Leonard of <unk> is a parody of Leonardo da Vinci . 
 Another hallmark of his writing was the use of capitalised dialogue without quotation marks , used to indicate the character of Death communicating telepathically into a character 's mind . Other characters or types of characters were given similarly distinctive ways of speaking , such as the auditors of reality never having quotation marks , Ankh @-@ Morpork grocers never using punctuation correctly , and golems capitalising each word in everything they say . Pratchett also made up a new colour , <unk> , a ' fluorescent greenish @-@ yellow @-@ purple ' , which is the eighth colour in the Discworld spectrum â the colour of magic . Indeed , the number eight itself is regarded in the Discworld as being a magical number ; for example , the eighth son of an eighth son will be a wizard , and his eighth son will be a " <unk> " ( which is one reason why wizards are not allowed to have children ) . 
 Discworld novels often included a modern innovation and its introduction to the world 's medieval setting , such as a public police force ( Guards ! Guards ! ) , guns ( Men at Arms ) , submarines ( Jingo ) , cinema ( Moving Pictures ) , investigative journalism ( The Truth ) , the postage stamp ( Going Postal ) , modern banking ( Making Money ) , and the steam engine ( Raising Steam ) . The " <unk> " , the tower @-@ to @-@ tower semaphore system that sprang up in later novels , is a mechanical optical telegraph ( used in Napoleon 's Era successfully ) before wired electric telegraph chains , with all the change and turmoil that such an advancement implies . The resulting social upheaval driven by these changes serves as the setting for the main story . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 Pratchett made no secret of outside influences on his work : they were a major source of his humour . He imported numerous characters from classic literature , popular culture and ancient history , always adding an unexpected twist . Pratchett was a crime novel fan , which was reflected in frequent appearances of the Ankh @-@ Morpork City Watch in the Discworld series . Pratchett was an only child , and his characters are often without siblings . Pratchett explained , " In fiction , only @-@ children are the interesting ones " . 
 Pratchett 's earliest inspirations were The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame , and the works of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke . His literary influences have been P.G. Wodehouse , Tom Sharpe , Jerome K. Jerome , Roy Lewis , Alan Coren , G. K. Chesterton , and Mark Twain . 
 = = = Publishing history = = = 
 While Pratchett 's UK publishing history remained quite stable , his relationships with international publishers were turbulent ( especially in America ) . He changed German publishers after an advertisement for Maggi soup appeared in the middle of the German @-@ language version of Pyramids . 
 = = Works = = 
 = = = The Discworld series = = = 
 Pratchett began writing the Discworld series in 1983 to " have fun with some of the cliches " and it is a humorous and often satirical sequence of stories set in the colourful fantasy Discworld universe . The series contains various story arcs ( or sub @-@ series ) , and a number of free @-@ standing stories . All are set in an abundance of locations in the same detailed and unified world , such as the Unseen University and ' The Drum / Broken Drum / <unk> Drum ' public house in the twin city Ankh @-@ Morpork , or places in the various continents , regions and countries on the Disc . Characters and locations reappear throughout the series , variously taking major and minor roles . 
 The Discworld itself is described as a large disc resting on the backs of four giant elephants , all supported by the giant turtle Great A 'Tuin as it swims its way through space . The books are essentially in chronological order , and advancements can be seen in the development of the Discworld civilisations , such as the creation of paper money in Ankh @-@ Morpork . 
 Many of the novels in Pratchett 's Discworld series parody real @-@ world subjects such as film making , newspaper publishing , rock and roll music , religion , philosophy , Ancient Greece , Egyptian history , the Gulf War , Australia , university politics , trade unions , and the financial world . Pratchett also included further parody as a feature within the stories , including such subjects as Ingmar Bergman films , numerous fiction , science fiction , and fantasy characters , and various bureaucratic and ruling systems . 
 = = = Other Discworld books = = = 
 Pratchett wrote or collaborated on a number of Discworld books that are not novels in themselves but serve to accompany the series . 
 The Discworld Companion , written with Stephen Briggs , is an encyclopaedic guide to Discworld . The third edition was renamed The New Discworld Companion , and was published in 2003 . The fourth and most recent edition of the companion , Turtle Recall was published on 18 October 2012 . Briggs also collaborated with Pratchett on a series of fictional Discworld " <unk> " . The first , The Discworld Mapp ( 1995 ) , illustrated by Stephen Player , comprises a large , comprehensive map of the Discworld itself with a small booklet that contains short biographies of the Disc 's prominent explorers and their discoveries . Three further " <unk> " , have been released , focusing on particular regions of the Disc : Ankh @-@ Morpork , Lancre , and Death 's Domain . 
 Between 1997 and 2015 , ten Discworld Diaries were published as collaborations with Briggs or the <unk> Emporium . Pratchett and Tina Hannan collaborated on Nanny Ogg 's Cookbook ( 1999 ) . The design of this cookbook , illustrated by Paul Kidby , was based on the traditional Mrs Beeton 's Book of Household Management , but with humorous recipes . Pratchett and Bernard Pearson collaborated on The Discworld <unk> , for the Year of the Prawn , with illustration by Paul Kidby , Pearson and Sheila Watkins . 
 Collections of Discworld @-@ related art have also been released in book form . The Pratchett Portfolio ( 1996 ) and The Art of Discworld ( 2004 ) are collections of paintings of major Discworld characters by Paul Kidby , with details added by Pratchett on the character 's origins . 
 In 2005 , Pratchett 's first book for very young children was Where 's My Cow ? Illustrated by Melvyn Grant , this is a realisation of the short story Sam <unk> reads to his child in Thud ! . 
 The Unseen University Cut Out Book was published in 2006 developed with Alan Bately and Bernard Pearson . The book contains cut @-@ out templates of seven of the major buildings in the Unseen University . 
 Following on from the release of Sky 's adaptation of Hogfather , Terry Pratchett 's Hogfather , The Illustrated Screenplay was released in 2006 . It was written by Vadim Jean and " mucked about with by Terry Pratchett " . It contains the final shooting script , pictures from the film and additional illustrations by Stephen Player . It was published by Gollancz . 
 Pratchett and the Discworld Emporium published The Compleat Ankh @-@ Morpork City Guide in 2012 which combined a trade directory , gazetteer , laws and ordinances together with a fully revised city map with artwork by Bernard Pearson , Ian Mitchell and Peter Dennis . 
 A number of publications have been released on the back of Pratchett 's novels with the participation of the Discworld Emporium : 
 The World of Poo ; a book by Miss Felicity Beedle who features in Snuff ( 2012 ) 
 Mrs Bradshaw 's Handbook : an illustrated guide to Discworld railway ( Raising Steam , 2014 ) 
 Pratchett resisted mapping the Discworld for quite some time , noting that a firmly designed map restricts narrative possibility ( i.e. , with a map , fans would complain if he placed a building on the wrong street , but without one , he could adjust the geography to fit the story ) . 
 = = = = The Science of Discworld = = = = 
 Pratchett wrote four Science of Discworld books in collaboration with Professor of mathematics Ian Stewart and reproductive biologist Jack Cohen , both of the University of Warwick : The Science of Discworld ( 1999 ) , The Science of Discworld II : The Globe ( 2002 ) , The Science of Discworld III : Darwin 's Watch ( 2005 ) , and The Science of Discworld IV : Judgement Day ( 2013 ) . 
 All four books have chapters that alternate between fiction and non @-@ fiction : the fictional chapters are set within the Discworld universe , where characters observe , and experiment on , a universe with the same physics as ours . The non @-@ fiction chapters ( written by Stewart and Cohen ) explain the science behind the fictional events . 
 In 1999 , Pratchett appointed both Cohen and Stewart as " Honorary Wizards of the Unseen University " at the same ceremony at which the University of Warwick awarded him an honorary degree .

 Pratchett collaborated with the folklorist Dr Jacqueline Simpson on The Folklore of Discworld ( 2008 ) , a study of the relationship between many of the persons , places and events described in the Discworld books and their counterparts in myths , legends , fairy tales and folk customs on Earth . 
 = = = Other novels and writing = = = 
 Pratchett 's first two adult novels , The Dark Side of the Sun ( 1976 ) and Strata ( 1981 ) , were both science @-@ fiction , the latter taking place partly on a disc @-@ shaped world . Subsequent to these , Pratchett mostly concentrated on his Discworld series and novels for children , with two exceptions : Good Omens ( 1990 ) , a collaboration with Neil Gaiman ( which was nominated for both Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1991 ) , a humorous story about the Apocalypse set on Earth , and Nation ( 2008 ) , a book for young adults . 
 After writing Good Omens , Pratchett began to work with Larry Niven on a book that would become Rainbow Mars ; Niven eventually completed the book on his own , but states in the afterword that a number of Pratchett 's ideas remained in the finished version . 
 Pratchett also collaborated with British science fiction author Stephen Baxter on a parallel earth series . The first novel , entitled The Long Earth was released on 21 June 2012 . A second novel , The Long War , was released on 18 June 2013 . The Long Mars was published in 2014 .

 According to Pratchett 's assistant Rob Wilkins , Pratchett left " an awful lot " of unfinished writing , " 10 titles I know of and fragments from many other bits and pieces . " In the past , Pratchett himself mentioned at least two texts , Scouting for Trolls , and a Discworld novel centering on a new character . The notes left behind outline ideas about " how the old folk of the Twilight Canyons solve the mystery of a missing treasure and defeat the rise of a Dark Lord despite their failing memories " , " the secret of the crystal cave and the carnivorous plants in the Dark <unk> " , about Constable Feeney of the Watch , first introduced in Snuff , involving how he " solves a whodunnit among the congenitally decent and honest goblins " , and on a second book about Amazing Maurice from The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents . 
 Pratchett 's daughter is the current custodian of the Discworld franchise , and has stated on several occasions that she has no plans to publish any of her father 's unfinished work , or to continue the Discworld on her own .

 " I Married Marge " is the twelfth episode of The Simpsons ' third season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 26 , 1991 . In the episode , Marge worries that she may yet again be pregnant and drives to Dr. Hibbert 's office . While anxiously waiting , Homer begins to tell Bart , Lisa , and Maggie the story of how he and Marge got married and how Bart was born . 
 Written by Jeff Martin and directed by Jeffrey Lynch , " I Married Marge " was the second flashback episode of The Simpsons after season two 's " The Way We Was " . It features cultural references to The Empire Strikes Back , Charlie 's Angels , and Ms. Pac @-@ Man . The title of the episode is a play on the American television series I Married Joan . Since airing , " I Married Marge " has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . It acquired a Nielsen rating of 11 @.@ 9 and was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network the week it aired . 
 The episode was the first of three about the births of the Simpsons children , this one covering Bart 's birth , with Lisa 's covered in " Lisa 's First Word " in the fourth season , and Maggie 's covered in the sixth season episode " And Maggie Makes Three " . The episode also expands upon the family 's origins as a result of Marge falling pregnant with Bart , briefly referred to in " The Way We Was " , and introduces key moments , such as Bart 's conception at a Mini @-@ Golf course , which would ultimately become a major part of the series ' canon . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Marge and Homer worry that Marge may be pregnant again after a home pregnancy test gives inconclusive results , so Marge drives to Dr. Hibbert 's office to take another test . While waiting , Homer tells Bart , Lisa , and Maggie the story of how he and Marge got married , and Bart 's birth thereafter . In 1980 , Homer works at a miniature golf course and is dating Marge . One night , they make out inside of a golf course castle after seeing The Empire Strikes Back . A few days later , Marge feels sick and tells Homer she might be pregnant . He takes her to the office of Dr. Hibbert , who confirms that Marge is pregnant . Homer is less than thrilled over the announcement , but since he loves Marge he proposes to her and she accepts . 
 They decide to name their new baby Bart , as it is the first name they could think of that Homer did not think other children would make fun of . The two marry in a small wedding chapel across the state line . They spend their wedding night at Marge 's family 's house , sleeping on a couch in the living room , which irritates Marge 's mother , Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma . 
 Homer 's wages at the miniature golf course are insufficient to pay for his new family so he attempts to get a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant , but is unsuccessful . When Homer and Marge 's newly purchased baby supplies and Marge 's wedding ring are repossessed , Homer decides to leave and find a job . When Marge reads the letter Homer left behind explaining his actions , she is brought to tears . Homer gets a job at a " Gulp N ' Blow " taco restaurant , where Patty and Selma find him . Selma , seeing how unhappy her younger sister is without Homer , decides to tell Marge the truth in spite of Patty 's reluctance ( due to her obvious hatred of Homer ) . Marge finds Homer and convinces him to come back home with her . When Homer says he cannot provide much material wealth for Marge , she reminds him that anything he gives her is valuable , because it is from him . 
 Homer applies for a job at the power plant once more , this time marching into Mr. Burns 's office and telling him that he will be the perfect employee . Mr. Burns is so impressed that he hires Homer on the spot . When Homer returns to Marge 's house , he discovers from his mother @-@ in @-@ law that she has gone into labor and is already at the hospital . He quickly gets there and sees Marge with Selma and an angry Patty , who starts berating him . Fed up with her disrespect , Homer lashes out at Patty and angrily tells Patty ( as well as the rest of the Bouvier family ) to start showing him some respect for he has a job , a piece of news that Homer promptly tells Marge before she finally gives birth to Bart. After Homer finishes telling his flashback story , he admits to Bart that he received the greatest gift a man can have the day Bart was born . At that time , Marge arrives home with the news that she is not pregnant . They are both overjoyed and high @-@ five .

 " I Married Marge " was written by Jeff Martin and directed by Jeffrey Lynch . It was the second flashback episode of The Simpsons and a sequel to the previous one , " The Way We Was " , which tells the story of how Homer and Marge met in high school . Executive producer Sam Simon was concerned that the writers were being " inefficient " with the episode ; he thought the three plots of Homer and Marge 's marriage , the birth of Bart , and Homer getting his job should have been extended into three episodes instead of one . 
 The staff were concerned over the animation of the characters ' eyes in the episode , as the pupils were larger than normal , making the characters look " stoned " , and the eyeballs were " too round " and large . The animation artists at the animation studio in South Korea , where much of the animation process takes place , had begun stenciling the eyes with a template , which according to Lynch resulted in " strangely round eyes which look a little too big sometimes and much too perfect . Which is very un @-@ Simpsons like . " Marge was designed with shorter hair in the flashback sequences to make her appear younger . Lynch thought it was nice to see Marge in a " younger , more attractive mode , and sort of watching her progress through pregnancy . " 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The title of the episode is a reference to the American television series I Married Joan . Marge and Homer sing along to " You Light Up My Life " by Debby Boone in the car . When Marge is suspected to be pregnant , Bart wants to name the baby after rapper Kool Moe Dee , while Lisa wants to name her after Ariel , from The Little Mermaid . At the beginning of his story , Homer mentions the band Supertramp , and their popularity in the time period . While exiting the movie theater , Homer spoils the ending of The Empire Strikes Back for dozens of moviegoers awaiting the next show . He also compares Marge 's good looks to Princess Leia and her intelligence to Yoda , two characters from the film . 
 Homer 's encounter with the donut delivery man that delivers donuts to the power plant is a reference to a scene in the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory . Homer and his best friend Barney Gumble are watching Charlie 's Angels when Marge tells the news of her pregnancy . A poster of Farrah Fawcett , a cast member of Charlie 's Angels , hangs on the wall in Barney 's apartment . Dolly Parton 's 9 to 5 is heard when Homer looks for a new job . The sign outside the wedding chapel resembles Vegas Vic from the Pioneer Club in Las Vegas . When Homer returns to the power plant to apply for a job the second time , Mr. Burns is seen playing the arcade game Ms. Pac @-@ Man . The episode marks the first appearance of Burns 's assistant Smithers 's first name , Waylon , which comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers .

 Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . Pete Oliva of North Texas Daily praised the writers for providing back stories that are " believable " and do not feel " contrived or hastily thought through . " The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , thought it was a " moving " episode with " plenty of great setpieces . " DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson described the episode as " sweet and funny " and a " nice piece of Simpsons history . " Jacobson went on to say that he enjoyed the flashback concept and that the episode develops the characters " nicely " and gives the viewers " a good sense for the era in which it takes place . " Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave it a 5 / 5 rating , and highlighted the scenes with Marge 's sisters Patty and Selma , " <unk> Homer with insults " , as the " funniest moments " of the episode . Meyers added : " The episode 's climax is a great moment for Homer and fans of the show . " Molly Griffin of The Observer said " I Married Marge " is one of the season three episode that turned the show into " the cultural force it is today . " 
 In his book Drawn to Television â Prime @-@ time Animation from the Flintstones to Family Guy , Keith Booker wrote : " The episode details in a rather sentimental fashion the early struggles of the irresponsible Homer to support his new family [ ... ] Such background episodes add an extra dimension to the portrayal of the animated Simpson family , making them seem oddly real and adding weight to their status as a family with a long history together .

 = Gary Cooper = 
 Gary Cooper ( born Frank James Cooper ; May 7 , 1901 â May 13 , 1961 ) was an American film actor known for his natural , authentic , and understated acting style and screen performances . His career spanned thirty @-@ five years , from 1925 to 1960 , and included leading roles in eighty @-@ four feature films . He was a major movie star from the end of the silent film era through the end of the golden age of Classical Hollywood . His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women , and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres . Cooper 's ability to project his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his appearing natural and authentic on screen . The screen persona he sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero . 
 Cooper began his career as a film extra and stunt rider and soon landed acting roles . After establishing himself as a Western hero in his early silent films , Cooper became a movie star in 1929 with his first sound picture , The Virginian . In the early 1930s , he expanded his heroic image to include more cautious characters in adventure films and dramas such as A Farewell to Arms ( 1932 ) and The Lives of a Bengal Lancer ( 1935 ) . During the height of his career , Cooper portrayed a new type of hero â a champion of the common man â in films such as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town ( 1936 ) , Meet John Doe ( 1941 ) , Sergeant York ( 1941 ) , The Pride of the Yankees ( 1942 ) , and For Whom the Bell Tolls ( 1943 ) . In the post @-@ war years , he portrayed more mature characters at odds with the world in films such as The Fountainhead ( 1949 ) and High Noon ( 1952 ) . In his final films , Cooper played non @-@ violent characters searching for redemption in films such as Friendly Persuasion ( 1956 ) and Man of the West ( 1958 ) . 
 He married New York debutante Veronica Balfe in 1933 , and the couple had one daughter . Their marriage was interrupted by a three @-@ year separation precipitated by Cooper 's love affair with Patricia Neal . Cooper received the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in Sergeant York and High Noon . He also received an Academy Honorary Award for his career achievements in 1961 . He was one of the top ten film personalities for twenty @-@ three consecutive years , and was one of the top money @-@ making stars for eighteen years . The American Film Institute ( AFI ) ranked Cooper eleventh on its list of the twenty five greatest male stars of classic Hollywood cinema . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Frank James Cooper was born on May 7 , 1901 , at 730 Eleventh Avenue in Helena , Montana to English immigrants Alice ( nÃ©e Brazier , 1873 â 1967 ) and Charles Henry Cooper ( 1865 â 1946 ) . His father emigrated from Houghton Regis , Bedfordshire and became a prominent lawyer , rancher , and eventually a Montana Supreme Court justice . His mother emigrated from Gillingham , Kent and married Charles in Montana . In 1906 , Charles purchased the 600 @-@ acre ( 240 ha ) Seven @-@ Bar @-@ Nine cattle ranch about fifty miles ( eighty kilometers ) north of Helena near the town of Craig on the Missouri River . Frank and his older brother Arthur spent their summers there and learned to ride horses , hunt , and fish . In April 1908 , the Hauser Dam failed and flooded the Missouri River valley along portions of the Cooper property , but Cooper and his family were able to evacuate in time . Cooper attended Central Grade School in Helena . 
 In the summer of 1909 , Alice , wanting her sons to have an English education , accompanied them to England and enrolled them in Dunstable Grammar School in Bedfordshire , where Cooper was educated from 1910 to 1912 . At Dunstable , Cooper studied Latin and French , and took several courses in English history . While he managed to adapt to the discipline of an English school and learned the requisite social graces , he never adjusted to the rigid class structure and formal Eton collars he was forced to wear . After completing confirmation classes , Cooper was baptized into the Anglican Church on December 3 , 1911 , at the Church of All Saints in Houghton Regis . Cooper 's mother accompanied her sons back to the United States in August 1912 , and Cooper resumed his education at Johnson Grammar School in Helena . 
 At the age of fifteen , Cooper injured his hip in a car accident and returned to the Seven @-@ Bar @-@ Nine ranch to recuperate by horseback riding at the recommendation of his doctor . The misguided therapy left him with his characteristic stiff , off @-@ balanced walk and slightly angled riding style . After attending Helena High School for two years , he left school in 1918 and returned to the family ranch to help raise their five hundred head of cattle and work full @-@ time as a cowboy . In 1919 , his father arranged for his son to complete his high school education at Gallatin County High School in Bozeman , Montana . His English teacher , Ida Davis , encouraged him to focus on academics , join the school 's debating team , and get involved in dramatics . His parents would later credit her for helping their son complete high school , and Cooper confirmed , " She was the woman partly responsible for me giving up cowboy @-@ ing and going to college . " 
 In 1920 , while still attending high school , Cooper took three art courses at Montana Agricultural College in Bozeman . His interest in art was inspired years earlier by the Western paintings of Charles Marion Russell and Frederic Remington . Cooper especially admired and studied Russell 's Lewis and Clark Meeting Indians at Ross ' Hole ( 1910 ) , which still hangs in the state capitol building in Helena . In 1922 , Cooper enrolled in Grinnell College in Iowa to continue his art education . Cooper did well academically in most of his courses , but was not accepted to the school 's drama club . His drawings and watercolors were exhibited throughout the dormitory , and he was named art editor for the college yearbook . During the summers of 1922 and 1923 , Cooper worked at Yellowstone National Park as a tour guide driving the yellow open @-@ top buses . Despite a promising first eighteen months at Grinnell , he left college suddenly in February 1924 , spent a month in Chicago looking for work as an artist , and then returned to Helena , where he sold editorial cartoons to the Independent , a local newspaper . 
 In the autumn of 1924 , Cooper 's father left the Montana Supreme Court bench and moved with his wife to Los Angeles to administer the estates of two relatives . At his father 's request , Cooper joined his parents in California on Thanksgiving Day , November 27 , 1924 . In the coming weeks , after working a series of unpromising jobs , Cooper met two friends from Montana , Jim <unk> and Jim Calloway , who were working as film extras and stunt riders in low @-@ budget Western films for the small movie studios on Poverty Row on Gower Street . They introduced him to another Montana cowboy , rodeo champion Jay " Slim " Talbot , who took him to see a casting director who offered him work . With the goal of saving enough money to pay for a professional art course , Cooper decided to try his hand at working as a film extra for five dollars a day , and as a stunt rider for twice that amount .

 In early 1925 , Cooper began his film career working in silent pictures such as The Thundering Herd and Wild Horse Mesa with Jack Holt , Riders of the Purple Sage and The Lucky Horseshoe with Tom Mix , and The Trail Rider with Buck Jones . He worked for several Poverty Row studios , including Famous Players @-@ Lasky and Fox Film Corporation . While his skills as a horseman led to steady work in Westerns , Cooper found the stunt work " tough and cruel " , sometimes resulting in injury to the horses and riders . Hoping to move beyond the risky stunt work and obtain acting roles , Cooper paid for a screen test and hired casting director Nan Collins to work as his agent . Knowing that other actors were using the name " Frank Cooper " , Collins suggested he change his first name to " Gary " after her hometown of Gary , Indiana . Cooper liked the name immediately . 
 Cooper also found work in a variety of non @-@ Western films , appearing , for example , as a masked Cossack in The Eagle ( 1925 ) , as a Roman guard in Ben @-@ Hur ( 1925 ) , and as a flood survivor in The Johnstown Flood ( 1926 ) . Gradually , he began to land credited roles that offered him more screen time , in films such as Tricks ( 1925 ) , in which he played the film 's antagonist , and the short film Lightnin ' Wins ( 1926 ) . As a featured player , he began to attract the attention of major film studios . On June 1 , 1926 , Cooper signed a contract with Samuel Goldwyn Productions for fifty dollars a week . 
 Cooper 's first important film role was in The Winning of Barbara Worth ( 1926 ) with Ronald Colman and Vilma <unk> . In the film , Cooper plays a young engineer , Abe Lee , who helps a rival suitor save the woman he loves and her town from an impending dam disaster . Cooper 's experience living among the Montana cowboys gave his performance an " instinctive authenticity " , according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers . The film premiered on October 14 and was a major success . Critics singled out Cooper as a " dynamic new personality " and future star . Goldwyn rushed to offer the actor a long @-@ term contract , but Cooper held out for a better deal â finally signing a five @-@ year contract with Jesse L. Lasky at Paramount Pictures for $ 175 a week . In 1927 , with help from established movie star Clara Bow , Cooper landed high @-@ profile roles in Children of Divorce and Wings , the latter being the first film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture . That year , Cooper also appeared in his first starring roles in Arizona Bound and Nevada â both films directed by John Waters . 
 In 1928 , Paramount paired Cooper with a youthful Fay Wray in The Legion of the Condemned and The First Kiss â advertising them as the studio 's " glorious young lovers " . Their on @-@ screen chemistry failed to generate much excitement with audiences . With each new film , Cooper 's acting skills improved and his popularity continued to grow , especially among female movie @-@ goers . During this time , he was earning as much as $ 2 @,@ 750 per film and receiving a thousand fan letters a week . Looking to exploit Cooper 's growing audience appeal , the studio placed him opposite popular leading ladies such as Evelyn Brent in Beau Sabreur , Florence Vidor in Doomsday , and Esther Ralston in Half a Bride . That year , Cooper also made Lilac Time with Colleen Moore for First National Pictures , his first movie with synchronized music and sound effects . It became one of the most commercially successful films of 1928 . 
 = = = Hollywood stardom , 1929 â 35 = = = 
 Cooper became a major movie star in 1929 with the release of his first sound picture , The Virginian , which was directed by Victor Fleming and co @-@ starred Mary Brian and Walter Huston . Based on the popular novel by Owen Wister , The Virginian was one of the first sound films to define the Western code of honor and helped establish many of the conventions of the Western movie genre that have lasted to the present day . According to biographer Jeffrey Meyers , the romantic image of the tall , handsome , and shy cowboy hero who embodied male freedom , courage , and honor was created in large part by Cooper in the film . Unlike some silent film actors who had trouble adapting to the new sound medium , Cooper transitioned naturally , with his " deep and clear " and " pleasantly drawling " voice , which was perfectly suited for the characters he portrayed on screen , also according to Meyers . Looking to capitalize on Cooper 's growing popularity , Paramount cast him in several Westerns and wartime dramas in 1930 , including Only the Brave , The Texan , Seven Days ' Leave , A Man from Wyoming , and The Spoilers . 
 One of the more important performances in Cooper 's early career was his portrayal of a sullen legionnaire in Josef von Sternberg 's 1930 film Morocco with Marlene Dietrich in her introduction to American audiences . During production , von Sternberg focused his energies on Dietrich and treated Cooper dismissively . Tensions came to a head after von Sternberg yelled directions at Cooper in German . The 6 @-@ foot @-@ 3 @-@ inch ( 191 cm ) actor approached the 5 @-@ foot @-@ 4 @-@ inch ( 163 cm ) director , physically picked him up by the collar and said , " If you expect to work in this country you 'd better get on to the language we use here . " Despite the tensions on the set , Cooper produced " one of his best performances " , according to Thornton <unk> of the New York Evening Post . In 1931 , after returning to the Western genre in Zane Grey 's Fighting Caravans with French actress Lili Damita , Cooper appeared in the Dashiell Hammett crime film City Streets playing a westerner who gets involved with big @-@ city gangsters in order to save the woman he loves . Cooper concluded the year with appearances in two unsuccessful films : I Take This Woman with Carole Lombard , and His Woman with Claudette Colbert . The demands and pressures of making ten films in two years left Cooper exhausted and in poor health , suffering from anemia and jaundice . He had lost thirty pounds ( fourteen kilograms ) during that period , and felt lonely , isolated , and depressed by his sudden fame and wealth . In May 1931 , Cooper left Hollywood and sailed to Algiers and then Italy , where he lived for the next year . 
 During his time abroad , Cooper stayed with the Countess Dorothy di Frasso at the Villa Madama in Rome , where she taught him about good food and vintage wines , how to read Italian and French menus , and how to socialize among Europe 's nobility and upper classes . After guiding him through the great art museums and galleries of Italy , she accompanied him on a ten @-@ week big @-@ game hunting safari on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa , where he was credited with over sixty kills , including two lions , a rhinoceros , and various antelopes . His safari experience in Africa had a profound influence on Cooper and intensified his love of the wilderness . After returning to Europe , he and the countess set off on a Mediterranean cruise of the Italian and French Rivieras . Rested and rejuvenated by his year @-@ long exile , a healthy Cooper returned to Hollywood in April 1932 and negotiated a new contract with Paramount for two films per year , a salary of $ 4 @,@ 000 a week , and director and script approval . 
 In 1932 , after completing Devil and the Deep with Tallulah Bankhead to fulfill his old contract , Cooper appeared in A Farewell to Arms , the first film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel . Co @-@ starring Helen Hayes , a leading New York theatre star and Academy Award winner , and Adolphe <unk> , the film presented Cooper with one of his most ambitious and challenging dramatic roles , playing an American ambulance driver wounded in Italy who falls in love with an English nurse during World War I. Critics praised his highly intense and emotional performance , and the film became one of the year 's most commercially successful pictures . In 1933 , after making Today We Live with Joan Crawford and One Sunday Afternoon with Fay Wray , Cooper appeared in the Ernst Lubitsch comedy film Design for Living , based on the successful NoÃ«l Coward play . Co @-@ starring Miriam Hopkins and Fredric March , the film received mixed reviews and did not do well at the box office . Cooper 's performance â playing an American artist in Europe competing with his playwright friend for the affections of a beautiful woman â was singled out for its versatility and revealed his genuine ability to do light comedy . Cooper changed his name legally to " Gary Cooper " in August 1933 . 
 In 1934 , Cooper was loaned out to MGM for the Civil War drama film Operator 13 with Marion Davies , about a beautiful Union spy who falls in love with a Confederate soldier . Despite Richard Boleslawski 's imaginative direction and George J. Folsey 's lavish cinematography , the film did poorly at the box office . Back at Paramount , Cooper appeared in his first of seven films by director Henry Hathaway , Now and Forever , with Carole Lombard and Shirley Temple . In the film , he plays a confidence man who tries to sell his daughter to the relatives who raised her , but is eventually won over by the adorable girl . Impressed by Temple 's intelligence and charm , Cooper developed a close rapport with her , both on and off screen . The film was a box @-@ office success . 
 The following year , Cooper was loaned out to Samuel Goldwyn Productions to appear in King Vidor 's romance film The Wedding Night with Anna Sten , who was being groomed as " another Garbo " . In the film , Cooper plays an alcoholic novelist who retreats to his family 's New England farm where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful Polish neighbor . Cooper delivered a performance of surprising range and depth , according to biographer Larry Swindell . Despite receiving generally favorable reviews , the film was not popular with American audiences , who may have been offended by the film 's depiction of an extramarital affair and its tragic ending . That same year , Cooper appeared in two Henry Hathaway films : the melodrama Peter Ibbetson with Ann Harding , about a man caught up in a dream world created by his love for a childhood sweetheart , and the adventure film The Lives of a Bengal Lancer , about a daring British officer and his men who defend their stronghold at Bengal against rebellious local tribes . While the former was more successful in Europe than in the United States , the latter was nominated for six Academy Awards and became one of Cooper 's most popular and successful adventure films . Hathaway had the highest respect for Cooper 's acting ability , calling him " the best actor of all of them " .

 The year 1936 marked an important turning point in Cooper 's career . After making Frank Borzage 's romantic comedy film Desire with Marlene Dietrich at Paramount â delivering a performance considered by some contemporary critics as one of his finest â Cooper returned to Poverty Row for the first time since his early silent film days to make Frank Capra 's screwball comedy Mr. Deeds Goes to Town with Jean Arthur for Columbia Pictures . In the film , Cooper plays the character of Longfellow Deeds , a quiet , innocent writer of greeting cards who inherits a fortune , leaves behind his idyllic life in Vermont , and travels to New York where he faces a world of corruption and deceit . Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin were able to use Cooper 's well @-@ established screen persona as the " quintessential American hero " â a symbol of honesty , courage , and goodness â to create a new type of " folk hero " for the common man . Commenting on Cooper 's impact on the character and the film , Capra observed : 
 As soon as I thought of Gary Cooper , it wasn 't possible to conceive anyone else in the role . He could not have been any closer to my idea of Longfellow Deeds , and as soon as he could think in terms of Cooper , Bob Riskin found it easier to develop the Deeds character in terms of dialogue . So it just had to be Cooper . Every line in his face spelled honesty . Our Mr. Deeds had to symbolize <unk> , and in my mind Gary Cooper was that symbol . 
 Both Desire and Mr. Deeds opened in April 1936 to critical praise and were major box @-@ office successes . In his review in The New York Times , Frank Nugent wrote that Cooper was " proving himself one of the best light comedians in Hollywood " . For his performance in Mr. Deeds , Cooper received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor . 
 Cooper appeared in two other Paramount films in 1936 . In Lewis Milestone 's adventure film The General Died at Dawn with Madeleine Carroll , he plays an American soldier of fortune in China who helps the peasants defend themselves against the oppression of a cruel warlord . Written by playwright Clifford Odets , the film was a critical and commercial success . In Cecil B. DeMille 's sprawling frontier epic The Plainsman â his first of four films with the director â Cooper portrays Wild Bill Hickok in a highly fictionalized version of the opening of the American western frontier . The film was an even greater box @-@ office hit than its predecessor , due in large part to Jean Arthur 's definitive depiction of Calamity Jane and Cooper 's inspired portrayal of <unk> as an enigmatic figure of " deepening mythic substance " . That year , Cooper appeared for the first time on the Motion Picture Herald exhibitor 's poll of top ten film personalities , where he would remain for the next twenty @-@ three years . 
 In late 1936 , while Paramount was preparing a new contract for Cooper that would raise his salary to $ 8 @,@ 000 a week , Cooper signed a contract with Samuel Goldwyn for six films over six years with a minimum guarantee of $ 150 @,@ 000 per picture . Paramount brought suit against Goldwyn and Cooper , and the court ruled that Cooper 's new Goldwyn contract afforded the actor sufficient time to also honor his Paramount agreement . Cooper continued to make films with both studios , and by 1939 the United States Treasury reported that Cooper was the country 's highest wage earner , at $ 482 @,@ 819 ( equivalent to $ 8 @.@ 21 million in 2015 ) . 
 In contrast to his output the previous year , Cooper appeared in only one picture in 1937 , Henry Hathaway 's adventure film Souls at Sea . A critical and box @-@ office failure , Cooper referred to it as his " almost picture " , saying , " It was almost exciting , and almost interesting . And I was almost good . " In 1938 , he appeared in Archie Mayo 's biographical film The Adventures of Marco Polo . Plagued by production problems and a weak screenplay , the film became Goldwyn 's biggest failure to that date , losing $ 700 @,@ 000 . During this period , Cooper turned down several important roles , including the role of Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind . Cooper was producer David O. Selznick 's first choice for the part . He made several overtures to the actor , but Cooper had doubts about the project , and did not feel suited to the role . Cooper later admitted , " It was one of the best roles ever offered in Hollywood ... But I said no . I didn 't see myself as quite that dashing , and later , when I saw Clark Gable play the role to perfection , I knew I was right . " 
 Back at Paramount , Cooper returned to a more comfortable genre in Ernst Lubitsch 's romantic comedy Bluebeard 's Eighth Wife ( 1938 ) with Claudette Colbert . In the film , Cooper plays a wealthy American businessman in France who falls in love with an impoverished aristocrat 's daughter and persuades her to become his eighth wife . Despite the clever screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder , and solid performances by Cooper and Colbert , audiences had trouble accepting Cooper in the role of a shallow philanderer . For many of his fans , Cooper had become " Mr. Deeds incarnate " . In the fall of 1938 , Cooper appeared in H. C. Potter 's romantic comedy The Cowboy and the Lady with Merle Oberon , about a sweet @-@ natured rodeo cowboy who falls in love with the wealthy daughter of a presidential hopeful , believing her to be a poor , hard @-@ working lady 's maid . The efforts of three directors and several eminent screenwriters could not salvage what could have been a fine vehicle for Cooper . While more successful than its predecessor , the film was Cooper 's fourth consecutive box @-@ office failure . 
 In the next two years , Cooper was more discerning about the roles he accepted and made four successful large @-@ scale adventure and cowboy films . In William A. Wellman 's adventure film Beau Geste ( 1939 ) , he plays one of three daring English brothers who join the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara to fight local tribes . Filmed in the same Mojave Desert locations as the original 1926 version with Ronald Colman , Beau Geste provided Cooper with magnificent sets , exotic settings , high @-@ spirited action , and a role tailored to his personality and screen persona . This was the last film in Cooper 's contract with Paramount . In Henry Hathaway 's The Real Glory ( 1939 ) , he plays a military doctor who accompanies a small group of American Army officers to the Philippines to help the Christian Filipinos defend themselves against Muslim radicals . Many film critics praised Cooper 's performance , including author and film critic Graham Greene who recognized that he " never acted better " .

 Cooper returned to the Western genre in William Wyler 's The Westerner ( 1940 ) with Walter Brennan and Doris Davenport , about a drifting cowboy who defends homesteaders against Roy Bean , a corrupt judge known as the " law west of the Pecos " . Screenwriter Niven Busch relied on Cooper 's extensive knowledge of Western history while working on the script . The film received positive reviews and did well at the box @-@ office , with reviewers praising the performances of the two lead actors . That same year , Cooper appeared in his first all @-@ Technicolor feature , Cecil B. DeMille 's adventure film North West Mounted Police ( 1940 ) . In the film , Cooper plays a Texas Ranger who pursues an outlaw into western Canada where he joins forces with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who are after the same man , a leader of the North @-@ West Rebellion . While not as popular with critics as its predecessor , the film was another box @-@ office success â the sixth @-@ highest grossing film of 1940 . 
 The early 1940s were Cooper 's prime years as an actor . In a relatively short period , he appeared in five critically successful and popular films that produced some of his finest performances . When Frank Capra offered him the lead role in Meet John Doe before Robert Riskin even developed the script , Cooper accepted his friend 's offer , saying , " It 's okay , Frank , I don 't need a script . " In the film , Cooper plays Long John Willoughby , a down @-@ and @-@ out bush @-@ league pitcher hired by a newspaper to pretend to be a man who promises to commit suicide on Christmas Eve to protest all the hypocrisy and corruption in the country . Considered by some critics to be Capra 's best film at the time , Meet John Doe was received as a " national event " with Cooper appearing on the front page of Time magazine on March 3 , 1941 . In his review in the New York Herald Tribune , Howard Barnes called Cooper 's performance a " splendid and utterly persuasive portrayal " and praised his " utterly realistic acting which comes through with such authority " . Bosley Crowther , in The New York Times , wrote , " Gary Cooper , of course , is ' John Doe ' to the life and in the whole â shy , bewildered , non @-@ aggressive , but a veritable tiger when aroused . " 
 That same year , Cooper made two films with director and good friend Howard Hawks . In the biographical film Sergeant York , Cooper portrays war hero Alvin C. York , one of the most decorated American soldiers in World War I. The film chronicles York 's early backwoods days in Tennessee , his religious conversion and subsequent piety , his stand as a conscientious objector , and finally his heroic actions at the Battle of the Argonne Forest , which earned him the Medal of Honor . Initially , Cooper was nervous and uncertain about playing a living hero , so he traveled to Tennessee to visit York at his home , and the two quiet men established an immediate rapport and discovered they had much in common . Inspired by York 's encouragement , Cooper delivered a performance that Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune called " one of extraordinary conviction and versatility " , and that Archer Winston of the New York Post called " one of his best " . After the film 's release , Cooper was awarded the Distinguished Citizenship Medal by the Veterans of Foreign Wars for his " powerful contribution to the promotion of patriotism and loyalty " . York admired Cooper 's performance and helped promote the film for Warner Bros. Sergeant York became the top @-@ grossing film of the year and was nominated for eleven Academy Awards . Accepting his first Academy Award for Best Actor from his friend James Stewart , Cooper said , " It was Sergeant Alvin York who won this award . <unk> , I 've been in the business sixteen years and sometimes dreamed I might get one of these . That 's all I can say ... Funny when I was dreaming I always made a better speech . " 
 Cooper concluded the year back at Goldwyn with Howard Hawks to make the romantic comedy Ball of Fire with Barbara Stanwyck . In the film , Cooper plays a shy linguistics professor who leads a team of seven scholars who are writing an encyclopedia . While researching slang , he meets Stanwyck 's flirtatious burlesque stripper <unk> O 'Shea who blows the dust off their staid life of books . The screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder provided Cooper the opportunity to exercise the full range of his light comedy skills . In his review for the New York Herald Tribune , Howard Barnes wrote that Cooper handled the role with " great skill and comic emphasis " and that his performance was " utterly delightful " . Though small in scale , Ball of Fire was one of the top @-@ grossing films of the year â Cooper 's fourth consecutive picture to make the top twenty . 
 Cooper 's only film appearance in 1942 was also his last under his Goldwyn contract . In Sam Wood 's biographical film The Pride of the Yankees , Cooper portrays baseball star Lou Gehrig who established a record with the New York Yankees for playing in 2 @,@ 130 consecutive games . Cooper was reluctant to play the seven @-@ time All @-@ Star , who only died the previous year from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) â now commonly called " Lou Gehrig 's disease " . Beyond the challenges of effectively portraying such a popular and nationally recognized figure , Cooper knew very little about baseball and was not left @-@ handed like Gehrig . After Gehrig 's widow visited the actor and expressed her desire that he portray her husband , Cooper accepted the role that covered a twenty @-@ year span of Gehrig 's life â his early love of baseball , his rise to greatness , his loving marriage , and his struggle with illness , culminating in his farewell speech at Yankee Stadium on July 4 , 1939 before 62 @,@ 000 fans . Cooper quickly learned the physical movements of a baseball player and developed a fluid , believable swing . The handedness issue was solved by reversing the print for certain batting scenes . The film was one of the year 's top ten pictures and received eleven Academy Award nominations , including Best Picture and Best Actor ( Cooper 's third ) . 
 Soon after the publication of Ernest Hemingway 's novel For Whom the Bell Tolls , Paramount paid $ 150 @,@ 000 for the film rights with the express intent of casting Cooper in the lead role of Robert Jordan , an American explosives expert who fights alongside the Republican loyalists during the Spanish Civil War . The original director , Cecil B. DeMille , was replaced by Sam Wood who brought in Dudley Nichols for the screenplay . After the start of principal photography in the Sierra Nevada in late 1942 , Ingrid Bergman was brought in to replace ballerina Vera <unk> as the female lead â a change supported by Cooper and Hemingway . The love scenes between Bergman and Cooper were " rapturous " and passionate . Howard Barnes in the New York Herald Tribune wrote that both actors performed with " the true stature and authority of stars " . While the film distorted the novel 's original political themes and meaning , For Whom the Bell Tolls was a critical and commercial success and received ten Academy Award nominations , including Best Picture and Best Actor ( Cooper 's fourth ) . 
 Cooper did not serve in the military during World War II due to his age and health , but like many of his colleagues , he got involved in the war effort by entertaining the troops . In June 1943 , he visited military hospitals in San Diego , and often appeared at the Hollywood Canteen serving food to the servicemen . In late 1943 , Cooper undertook a 23 @,@ 000 @-@ mile ( 37 @,@ 000 km ) tour of the South West Pacific with actresses Una Merkel and Phyllis Brooks , and accordionist Andy <unk> . Traveling on a B @-@ 24A Liberator bomber , the group toured the Cook Islands , Fiji , New Caledonia , Queensland , Brisbane â where General Douglas MacArthur told Cooper he was watching Sergeant York in a Manila theater when Japanese bombs began falling â New Guinea , Jayapura , and throughout the Solomon Islands . The group often shared the same sparse living conditions and K @-@ rations as the troops . Cooper met with the servicemen and women , visited military hospitals , introduced his attractive colleagues , and participated in occasional skits . The shows concluded with Cooper 's moving recitation of Lou Gehrig 's farewell speech . When he returned to the United States , he visited military hospitals throughout the country . Cooper later called his time with the troops the " greatest emotional experience " of his life .

 In 1944 , Cooper appeared in Cecil B. DeMille 's wartime adventure film The Story of Dr. Wassell with Laraine Day â his third movie with the director . In the film , Cooper plays American doctor and missionary Corydon M. Wassell , who leads a group of wounded sailors through the jungles of Java to safety . Despite receiving poor reviews , Dr. Wassell was one of the top @-@ grossing films of the year . With his Goldwyn and Paramount contracts now concluded , Cooper decided to remain independent and formed his own production company , International Pictures , with Leo Spitz , William Goetz , and Nunnally Johnson . The fledgling studio 's first offering was Sam Wood 's romantic comedy Casanova Brown with Teresa Wright , about a man who learns his soon @-@ to @-@ be ex @-@ wife is pregnant with his child , just as he is about to marry another woman . The film received poor reviews , with the New York Daily News calling it " delightful nonsense " , and Bosley Crowther , in The New York Times , criticizing Cooper 's " somewhat obvious and ridiculous clowning " . The film was barely profitable . In 1945 , Cooper starred in and produced Stuart Heisler 's Western comedy Along Came Jones with Loretta Young for International . In this lighthearted parody of his past heroic image , Cooper plays comically inept cowboy Melody Jones who is mistaken for a ruthless killer . Audiences embraced Cooper 's character , and the film was one of the top box @-@ office pictures of the year â a testament to Cooper 's still vital audience appeal . It was also International 's biggest financial success during its brief history before being sold off to Universal Studios in 1946 . 
 Cooper 's career during the post @-@ war years drifted in new directions as American society was changing . While he still played conventional heroic roles , his films now relied less on his heroic screen persona and more on novel stories and exotic settings . In November 1945 , Cooper appeared in Sam Wood 's nineteenth century period drama Saratoga Trunk with Ingrid Bergman , about a Texas cowboy and his relationship with a beautiful fortune @-@ hunter . Filmed in early 1943 , the movie 's release was delayed for two years due to the increased demand for war movies . Despite poor reviews , Saratoga Trunk did well at the box office and became one of the top money @-@ makers of the year for Warner Bros. Cooper 's only film in 1946 was Fritz Lang 's romantic thriller Cloak and Dagger , about a mild @-@ mannered physics professor recruited by the OSS during the last years of World War II to investigate the German atomic bomb program . Playing a part loosely based on physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer , Cooper was uneasy with the role and was unable to convey the " inner sense " of the character . The film received poor reviews and was a box @-@ office failure . In 1947 , Cooper appeared in Cecil B. DeMille 's epic adventure film Unconquered with Paulette Goddard , about a Virginia militiaman who defends settlers against an unscrupulous gun trader and hostile Indians on the Western frontier during the eighteenth century . The film received mixed reviews , but even long @-@ time DeMille critic James Agee acknowledged the picture had " some authentic flavor of the period " . This last of four films made with DeMille was Cooper 's most lucrative , earning the actor over $ 300 @,@ 000 in salary and percentage of profits . Unconquered would be his last unqualified box @-@ office success for the next five years . 
 In 1948 , after making Leo McCarey 's romantic comedy Good Sam , Cooper sold his company to Universal Studios and signed a long @-@ term contract with Warner Bros. that gave him script and director approval and a guaranteed $ 295 @,@ 000 per picture . His first film under the new contract was King Vidor 's drama The Fountainhead ( 1949 ) with Patricia Neal and Raymond Massey . In the film , Cooper plays an idealistic and uncompromising architect who struggles to maintain his integrity and individualism in the face of societal pressures to conform to popular standards . Based on the novel by Ayn Rand who also wrote the screenplay , the film reflects her Objectivist philosophy and attacks the concepts of altruism and collectivism while promoting the virtues of selfishness and individualism . For most critics , Cooper was hopelessly miscast in the role of Howard Roark . In his review for The New York Times , Bosley Crowther concluded he was " Mr. Deeds out of his element " . Cooper returned to his element in Delmer Daves ' war drama Task Force ( 1949 ) , about a retiring rear admiral who reminisces about his long career as a naval aviator and his role in the development of aircraft carriers . Cooper 's performance and the Technicolor newsreel footage supplied by the United States Navy made the film one of Cooper 's most popular during this period . In the next two years , Cooper made four poorly received films : Michael Curtiz ' period drama Bright Leaf ( 1950 ) , Stuart Heisler 's Western melodrama Dallas ( 1950 ) , Henry Hathaway 's wartime comedy You 're in the Navy Now ( 1951 ) , and Raoul Walsh 's Western action film Distant Drums ( 1951 ) . 
 Cooper 's most important film during the post @-@ war years was Fred Zinnemann 's Western drama High Noon ( 1952 ) with Grace Kelly for United Artists . In the film , Cooper plays retiring sheriff Will Kane who is preparing to leave town on his honeymoon when he learns that an outlaw he helped put away and his three henchmen are returning to seek their revenge . Unable to gain the support of the frightened townspeople , and abandoned by his young bride , Kane nevertheless stays to face the outlaws alone . During the filming , Cooper was in poor health and in considerable pain from stomach ulcers . His ravaged face and discomfort in some scenes " photographed as self @-@ doubt " , according to biographer Hector Arce , and contributed to the effectiveness of his performance . Considered one of the first " adult " Westerns for its theme of moral courage , High Noon received enthusiastic reviews for its artistry , with Time magazine placing it in the ranks of Stagecoach and The Gunfighter . Bosley Crowther , in The New York Times , wrote that Cooper was " at the top of his form " , and John McCarten , in The New Yorker , wrote that Cooper was never more effective . The film earned $ 3 @.@ 75 million in the United States and $ 18 million worldwide . Following the example of his friend James Stewart , Cooper accepted a lower salary in exchange for a percent of the profits , and ended up making $ 600 @,@ 000 . Cooper 's understated performance was widely praised , and earned him his second Academy Award for Best Actor .

 After appearing in AndrÃ© de Toth 's Civil War drama Springfield Rifle ( 1952 ) â a standard Warner Bros. film that was overshadowed by the success of its predecessor â Cooper made four films outside the United States . In Mark Robson 's drama Return to Paradise ( 1953 ) , Cooper plays an American wanderer who liberates the inhabitants of a Polynesian island from the puritanical rule of a misguided pastor . Cooper endured spartan living conditions , long hours , and ill health during the three @-@ month location shoot on the island of Upolu in Western Samoa . Despite its beautiful cinematography , the film received poor reviews . Cooper 's next three films were shot in Mexico . In Hugo <unk> 's action adventure film Blowing Wild ( 1953 ) with Barbara Stanwyck , he plays a wildcatter in Mexico who gets involved with an oil company executive and his unscrupulous wife with whom he once had an affair . In 1954 , Cooper appeared in Henry Hathaway 's Western drama Garden of Evil with Susan Hayward , about three soldiers of fortune in Mexico hired to rescue a woman 's husband . That same year , he appeared in Robert Aldrich 's Western adventure Vera Cruz with Burt Lancaster . In the film , Cooper plays an American adventurer hired by Emperor Maximilian I to escort a countess to Vera Cruz during the Mexican Rebellion of 1866 . All of these films received poor reviews but did well at the box @-@ office . For his work in Vera Cruz , Cooper earned $ 1 @.@ 4 million in salary and percent of the gross . 
 During this period , Cooper struggled with health problems . As well as his ongoing treatment for ulcers , he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of Blowing Wild when he was hit by metal fragments from a dynamited oil well . During the filming of Vera Cruz , he reinjured his hip falling from a horse , and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding from the blank shell pierced his clothing . In 1955 , he appeared in Otto Preminger 's biographical war drama The Court @-@ Martial of Billy Mitchell , about the World War I general who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power , and was court @-@ martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters . Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast , and that his dull , tight @-@ lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell 's dynamic and caustic personality . In 1956 , Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler 's Civil War drama Friendly Persuasion with Dorothy McGuire . Like Sergeant York and High Noon , the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty . For his performance , Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor . The film was nominated for six Academy Awards , was awarded the Palme d 'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival , and went on to earn $ 8 million worldwide . 
 In 1956 , Cooper traveled to France to make Billy Wilder 's romantic comedy Love in the Afternoon with Audrey Hepburn and Maurice Chevalier . In the film , Cooper plays a middle @-@ aged American playboy in Paris who pursues and eventually falls in love with a much younger woman . Despite receiving some positive reviews â including from Bosley Crowther who praised the film 's " charming performances " â most reviewers concluded that Cooper was simply too old for the part . While audiences may not have welcomed seeing Cooper 's heroic screen image tarnished by his playing an aging rouÃ© trying to seduce an innocent young girl , the film was still a box @-@ office success . The following year , Cooper appeared in Philip Dunne 's romantic drama Ten North Frederick In the film , which was based on the novel by John O 'Hara , Cooper plays an attorney whose life is ruined by a double @-@ crossing politician and his own secret affair with his daughter 's young roommate . While Cooper brought " conviction and controlled anguish " to his performance , according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers , it was not enough to save what Bosley Crowther called a " hapless film " . 
 Despite his ongoing health problems and several operations for ulcers and hernias , Cooper continued to work in action films . In 1958 , he appeared in Anthony Mann 's Western drama Man of the West ( 1958 ) with Julie London and Lee J. Cobb , about a reformed outlaw and killer who is forced to confront his violent past when the train he is riding in is held up by his former gang members . The film has been called Cooper 's " most pathological Western " , with its themes of impotent rage , sexual humiliation , and sadism . According to biographer Jeffrey Meyers , Cooper , who struggled with moral conflicts in his personal life , " understood the anguish of a character striving to retain his integrity ... [ and ] brought authentic feeling to the role of a tempted and tormented , yet essentially decent man " . Mostly ignored by critics at the time , the film is now well @-@ regarded by film scholars and is considered Cooper 's last great film . 
 After his Warner Bros. contract ended , Cooper formed his own production company , Baroda Productions , and made three unusual films in 1959 about redemption . In Delmer Daves ' Western drama The Hanging Tree , Cooper plays a frontier doctor who saves a criminal from a lynch mob , and later tries to exploit his sordid past . Cooper delivered a " powerful and persuasive " performance of an emotionally scarred man whose need to dominate others is transformed by the love and sacrifice of a woman . In Robert Rossen 's historical adventure They Came to <unk> with Rita Hayworth , he plays an army officer who is found guilty of cowardice and assigned the degrading task of recommending soldiers for the Medal of Honor during the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916 . While Cooper received positive reviews , Variety and Films in Review felt he was too old for the part . In Michael Anderson 's action drama The Wreck of the Mary Deare with Charlton Heston , Cooper plays a disgraced merchant marine officer who decides to stay aboard his sinking cargo ship in order to prove the vessel was deliberately scuttled and to redeem his good name . Like its two predecessors , the film was physically demanding . Cooper , who was a trained scuba diver , did most of his own underwater scenes . Biographer Jeffrey Meyers observed that in all three roles , Cooper effectively conveyed the sense of lost honor and desire for redemption â what Joseph Conrad in Lord Jim called the " struggles of an individual trying to save from the fire his idea of what his moral identity should be " .

 = = = Marriage and family = = = 
 Cooper was formally introduced to his future wife , twenty @-@ year @-@ old New York debutante Veronica Balfe , on Easter Sunday 1933 at a party given by her uncle , art director Cedric Gibbons . Called " Rocky " by her family and friends , she grew up on Park Avenue and attended finishing schools . Her stepfather was Wall Street tycoon Paul Shields . Cooper and Rocky were quietly married at her parents ' Park Avenue residence on December 15 , 1933 . According to his friends , the marriage had a positive impact on Cooper , who turned away from past indiscretions and took control of his life . Athletic and a lover of the outdoors , Rocky shared many of Cooper 's interests , including riding , skiing , and skeet @-@ shooting . She organized their social life , and her wealth and social connections provided Cooper access to New York high society . Cooper and his wife owned homes in the Los Angeles area in Encino ( 1933 â 36 ) , Brentwood ( 1936 â 53 ) , and Holmby Hills ( 1954 â 61 ) , and owned a vacation home in Aspen , Colorado ( 1949 â 53 ) . 
 Cooper 's daughter Maria Veronica Cooper was born on September 15 , 1937 . By all accounts , he was a patient and affectionate father , teaching Maria to ride a bicycle , play tennis , ski , and ride horses . Sharing many of her parents ' interests , she accompanied them on their travels and was often photographed with them . Like her father , she developed a love for art and drawing . As a family they vacationed together in Sun Valley , Idaho , spent time at Rocky 's parents ' country house in Southampton , New York , and took frequent trips to Europe . Cooper and Rocky were legally separated on May 16 , 1951 , when Cooper moved out of their home . For over two years , they maintained a fragile and uneasy family life with their daughter . Cooper moved back into their home in November 1953 , and their formal reconciliation occurred in February 1954 . 
 = = = Romantic relationships = = = 
 Prior to his marriage , Cooper had a series of romantic relationships with leading actresses , beginning in 1927 with Clara Bow , who advanced his career by helping him get one of his first leading roles in Children of Divorce . Bow was also responsible for getting Cooper a role in Wings , which generated an enormous amount of fan mail for the young actor . In 1928 , he had a relationship with another experienced actress , Evelyn Brent , whom he met while filming Beau Sabreur . In 1929 , while filming The Wolf Song , Cooper began an intense affair with Lupe VÃ©lez , which was the most important romance of his early life . During their two years together , Cooper also had brief affairs with Marlene Dietrich while filming Morocco in 1930 and with Carole Lombard while making I Take This Woman in 1931 . During his year abroad in 1931 â 32 , Cooper had an affair with the married Countess Dorothy di Frasso , while staying at her Villa Madama in Rome . 
 After he was married in December 1933 , Cooper remained faithful to his wife until the summer of 1942 , when he began an affair with Ingrid Bergman during the production of For Whom the Bell Tolls . Their relationship lasted through the completion of filming Saratoga Trunk in June 1943 . In 1948 , after finishing work on The Fountainhead , Cooper began an affair with actress Patricia Neal , his co @-@ star . At first they kept their affair discreet , but eventually it became an open secret in Hollywood , and Cooper 's wife confronted him with the rumors , which he admitted were true . He also confessed that he was in love with Neal , and continued to see her . Cooper and his wife were legally separated in May 1951 , but he did not seek a divorce . Neal ended their relationship in late December 1951 . During his three @-@ year separation from his wife , Cooper had affairs with Grace Kelly , Lorraine Chanel , and GisÃ¨le Pascal .

 For me the really satisfying things I do are offered me , free , for nothing . Ever go out in the fall and do a little hunting ? See the frost on the grass and the leaves turning ? Spend a day in the hills alone , or with good companions ? Watch a sunset and a moonrise ? Notice a bird in the wind ? A stream in the woods , a storm at sea , cross the country by train , and catch a glimpse of something beautiful in the desert , or the farmlands ? Free to everybody ... 
 Cooper 's twenty @-@ year friendship with Ernest Hemingway began at Sun Valley in October 1940 . The previous year , Hemingway drew upon Cooper 's image when he created the character of Robert Jordan for the novel For Whom the Bell Tolls . The two shared a passion for the outdoors , and for years they hunted duck and pheasant , and skied together in Sun Valley . Both men admired the work of Rudyard Kipling â Cooper kept a copy of the poem " If â " in his dressing room â and retained as adults Kipling 's sense of boyish adventure . As well as admiring Cooper 's hunting skills and knowledge of the outdoors , Hemingway believed his character matched his screen persona , once telling a friend , " If you made up a character like Coop , nobody would believe it . He 's just too good to be true . " They saw each other often , and their friendship remained strong through the years . 
 Cooper 's social life generally centered on sports , outdoor activities , and dinner parties with his family and friends from the film industry , including directors Henry Hathaway , Howard Hawks , William Wellman , and Fred Zinnemann , and actors Joel McCrea , James Stewart , Barbara Stanwyck , and Robert Taylor . As well as hunting , Cooper enjoyed riding , fishing , skiing , and later in life , scuba diving . He never abandoned his early love for art and drawing , and over the years , he and his wife acquired a private collection of modern paintings , including works by Pierre @-@ Auguste Renoir , Paul Gauguin , and Georgia O 'Keeffe . Cooper owned several works by Pablo Picasso , whom he met in 1956 . Cooper had a lifelong passion for automobiles , with a collection that included a 1930 Duesenberg . 
 Cooper was naturally reserved and introspective , and loved the solitude of outdoor activities . Not unlike his screen persona , his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional " yup " and " shucks " . He once said , " If others have more interesting things to say than I have , I keep quiet . " According to his friends , Cooper could also be an articulate , well @-@ informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses , guns , and Western history to film production , sports cars , and modern art . He was modest and unpretentious , frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments . His friends and colleagues described him as charming , well @-@ mannered , and thoughtful , with a lively boyish sense of humor . Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status â never sought special treatment or refused to work with a director or leading lady . His close friend Joel McCrea recalled , " Coop never fought , he never got mad , he never told anybody off that I know of ; everybody that worked with him liked him . " 
 = = = Political views = = = 
 Cooper was a conservative Republican like his father , and voted for Calvin Coolidge in 1924 , Herbert Hoover in 1928 and 1932 , and campaigned for Wendell Willkie in 1940 . When Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for an unprecedented fourth presidential term in 1944 , Cooper campaigned for Thomas E. Dewey and criticized Roosevelt for being dishonest and adopting " foreign " ideas . In a radio address that he paid for himself just prior to the election , Cooper said , " I disagree with the New Deal belief that the America all of us love is old and worn @-@ out and finished â and has to borrow foreign notions that don 't even seem to work any too well where they come from ... Our country is a young country that just has to make up its mind to be itself again . " He also attended a Republican rally at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum that drew 93 @,@ 000 Dewey supporters . 
 Cooper was one of the founding members of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals , a conservative organization dedicated , according to its statement of principles , to preserving the " American way of life " and opposing communism and fascism . The organization â whose membership included Walt Disney , Clark Gable , Ronald Reagan , Barbara Stanwyck , and John Wayne â pressured the United States Congress to investigate communist influence in the motion picture industry . On October 23 , 1947 , Cooper appeared before the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee ( HUAC ) and was asked if he had observed any " communistic influence " in Hollywood . Cooper recounted statements he 'd heard suggesting that the Constitution was out of date and that Congress was an unnecessary institution â comments that Cooper said he found to be " very un @-@ American " . He also testified that he had rejected several scripts because he thought they were " tinged with communist ideas " . Unlike some other witnesses , Cooper did not name any individuals during his testimony .

 Cooper was baptized in the Anglican Church in December 1911 in England , and was raised in the Episcopal Church in the United States . While he was never an observant Christian during his adult life , many of his friends believed he had a deeply spiritual side . 
 On June 26 , 1953 , Cooper accompanied his wife and daughter , who were devout Catholics , to Rome , where they had an audience with Pope Pius XII . Cooper and his wife were still separated at the time , but the papal visit marked the beginning of their gradual reconciliation . In the coming years , Cooper contemplated his mortality and his personal behavior , and started discussing Catholicism with his family . He began attending church with them regularly , and met with their parish priest , who offered Cooper spiritual guidance . After several months of study , Cooper was baptized as a Roman Catholic on April 9 , 1959 , before a small group of family and friends at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills .

 On April 14 , 1960 , Cooper underwent surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for prostate cancer after it had metastasized to his colon . He fell ill again on May 31 and underwent further surgery at Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles in early June to remove a malignant tumor from his large intestine . After recuperating over the summer , Cooper took his family on vacation to the south of France before traveling to England in the fall to make his last film , The Naked Edge . In December 1960 , he worked on the NBC television documentary The Real West , which was part of the company 's Project 20 series . On December 27 , his wife learned from their family doctor that Cooper 's cancer had spread to his lungs and bones and was inoperable . His family decided not to tell him immediately . 
 On January 9 , 1961 , Cooper attended a dinner given in his honor at the Friars Club hosted by Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin . Attended by many of his industry friends , the dinner concluded with a brief speech by Cooper who said , " The only achievement I 'm proud of is the friends I 've made in this community . " In mid @-@ January , Cooper took his family to Sun Valley for their last vacation together . Cooper and Hemingway hiked through the snow together for the last time . On February 27 , after returning to Los Angeles , Cooper learned that he was dying . He later told his family , " We 'll pray for a miracle ; but if not , and that 's God 's will , that 's all right too . " On April 17 , Cooper watched the Academy Awards ceremony on television and saw his good friend James Stewart , who had presented Cooper with his first Oscar years earlier , accept on Cooper 's behalf an honorary award for lifetime achievement â his third Oscar . Speaking to Cooper , an emotional Stewart said , " Coop , I want you to know I 'll get it to you right away . With it goes all the friendship and affection and the admiration and deep respect of all of us . We 're very , very proud of you , Coop . " The following day , newspapers around the world announced the news that Cooper was dying . In the coming days he received numerous messages of appreciation and encouragement , including telegrams from Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II , and a phone call from President John F. Kennedy . 
 On May 4 , Cooper , in his last public statement , said , " I know that what is happening is God 's will . I am not afraid of the future . " He received the last rites on May 12 . Cooper died quietly the following day , Saturday , May 13 , 1961 , at 12 : 47 pm , less than a week after his sixtieth birthday . A requiem mass was held on May 18 at the Church of the Good Shepherd , attended by many of Cooper 's friends , including James Stewart , Henry Hathaway , Joel McCrea , Audrey Hepburn , Jack L. Warner , John Ford , John Wayne , Edward G. Robinson , Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin , Randolph Scott , Walter Pidgeon , Bob Hope and Marlene Dietrich . Cooper was buried in the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City , California . In May 1974 , after his family relocated to New York , Cooper 's remains were exhumed and reburied in Sacred Hearts Cemetery in Southampton . His grave is marked by a three @-@ ton boulder from a Montauk quarry . 
 = = Acting style and reputation = = 
 Naturalness is hard to talk about , but I guess it boils down to this : You find out what people expect of your type of character and then you give them what they want . That way , an actor never seems unnatural or affected no matter what role he plays . 
 Cooper 's acting style consisted of three essential characteristics : his ability to project elements of his own personality onto the characters he portrayed , to appear natural and authentic in his roles , and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for the camera and the screen . Acting teacher Lee Strasberg once observed : " The simplest examples of Stanislavsky 's ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper , John Wayne , and Spencer Tracy . They try not to act but to be themselves , to respond or react . They refuse to say or do anything they feel not to be consonant with their own characters . " Film director FranÃ§ois Truffaut ranked Cooper among " the greatest actors " because of his ability to deliver great performances " without direction " . This ability to project elements of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced that he was simply " playing himself " . 
 Cooper 's ability to project his personality onto his characters played an important part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen . Actor John Barrymore said of Cooper , " This fellow is the world 's greatest actor . He does without effort what the rest of us spend our lives trying to learn â namely , to be natural . " Charles Laughton , who played opposite Cooper in Devil and the Deep agreed , " In truth , that boy hasn 't the least idea how well he acts ... He gets at it from the inside , from his own clear way of looking at life . " William Wyler , who directed Cooper in two films , called him a " superb actor , a master of movie acting " . In his review of Cooper 's performance in The Real Glory , Graham Greene wrote , " Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens , but there is no question here of his not acting . Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera â the casual jab of the needle , and the dressing slapped on while he talks , as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn 't have to think anymore . " 
 Cooper 's style of underplaying before the camera surprised many of his directors and fellow actors . Even in his earliest feature films , he recognized the camera 's ability to pick up slight gestures and facial movements . Commenting on Cooper 's performance in Sergeant York , director Howard Hawks observed , " He worked very hard and yet he didn 't seem to be working . He was a strange actor because you 'd look at him during a scene and you 'd think ... this isn 't going to be any good . But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he 'd been thinking . " Sam Wood , who directed Cooper in four films , had similar observations about Cooper 's performance in Pride of the Yankees , noting , " What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach . On the screen he 's perfect , yet on the set you 'd swear it 's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures . " His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor . Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper , actress Ingrid Bergman concluded , " The personality of this man was so enormous , so overpowering â and that expression in his eyes and his face , it was so delicate and so underplayed . You just didn 't notice it until you saw it on the screen . I thought he was marvelous ; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with . " 
 = = Career assessment and legacy = = 
 Cooper 's career spanned thirty @-@ six years , from 1925 to 1961 . During that time , he appeared in eighty @-@ four feature films in a leading role . He was a major movie star from the end of the silent film era to the end of the golden age of Classical Hollywood . His natural and authentic acting style appealed powerfully to both men and women , and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres , including Westerns , war films , adventure films , drama films , crime films , romance films , comedy films , and romantic comedy films . He appeared on the Motion Picture Herald exhibitor 's poll of top ten film personalities for twenty @-@ three consecutive years , from 1936 to 1958 . According to Quigley 's annual poll , Cooper was one of the top money @-@ making stars for eighteen years , appearing in the top ten in 1936 â 37 , 1941 â 49 , and 1951 â 57 . He topped the list in 1953 . In Quigley 's list of all @-@ time money @-@ making stars , Cooper is listed fourth , after John Wayne , Clint Eastwood , and Tom Cruise . At the time of his death , it was estimated that his films grossed well over $ 200 million ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 58 billion in 2015 ) . 
 In over half of his feature films , Cooper portrayed Westerners , soldiers , pilots , sailors , and explorers â all men of action . In the rest he played a wide range of characters , included doctors , professors , artists , architects , clerks , and baseball players . Cooper 's heroic screen image changed with each period of his career . In his early films , he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues ( The Virginian ) . After becoming a major star , his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure films and dramas ( A Farewell to Arms ) . During the height of his career , from 1936 to 1943 , he played a new type of hero â a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others ( Mr. Deeds , Meet John Doe , and For Whom the Bell Tolls ) . In the post @-@ war years , Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image , which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world who must face adversity alone ( The Fountainhead and High Noon ) . In his final films , Cooper 's hero rejects the violence of the past , and seeks to reclaim lost honor and find redemption ( Friendly Persuasion and Man of the West ) . The screen persona he developed and sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero â a tall , handsome , and sincere man of steadfast integrity who emphasized action over intellect , and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover , the adventurer , and the common man . 
 On February 6 , 1960 , Cooper was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at <unk> Hollywood Boulevard for his contribution to the film industry . He was also awarded a star on the sidewalk outside the Ellen Theater in Bozeman , Montana . On May 6 , 1961 , he was awarded the French Order of Arts and Letters in recognition of his significant contribution to the arts . On July 30 , 1961 , he was posthumously awarded the David di Donatello Special Award in Italy for his career achievements . In 1966 , he was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City . The American Film Institute ( AFI ) ranked Cooper eleventh on its list of the 25 male stars of classic Hollywood . Three of his characters â Will Kane , Lou Gehrig , and Sergeant York â made AFI 's list of the one hundred greatest heroes and villains , all of them as heroes . His Lou Gehrig line , " Today , I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth . " , is ranked by AFI as the thirty @-@ eighth greatest movie quote of all time . More than a half century after his death , Cooper 's enduring legacy , according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers , is his image of the ideal American hero preserved in his film performances . Charlton Heston once observed , " He projected the kind of man Americans would like to be , probably more than any actor that 's ever lived . "

 = Angelus Silesius = 
 Angelus Silesius ( c . 1624 â 9 July 1677 ) , born Johann Scheffler and also known as Johann Angelus Silesius , was a German Catholic priest and physician , known as a mystic and religious poet . Born and raised a Lutheran , he adopted the name Angelus ( Latin for " angel " or " heavenly messenger " ) and the epithet Silesius ( " Silesian " ) on converting to Catholicism in 1653 . While studying in the Netherlands , he began to read the works of medieval mystics and became acquainted with the works of the German mystic Jacob BÃ¶hme through BÃ¶hme 's friend , Abraham von Franckenberg . Silesius 's mystical beliefs caused tension between him and Lutheran authorities and led to his eventual conversion to Catholicism . He took holy orders under the Franciscans and was ordained a priest in 1661 . Ten years later , in 1671 , he retired to a Jesuit house where he remained for the rest of his life . 
 An enthusiastic convert and priest , Silesius worked to convince German Protestants in Silesia to return to the Roman Catholic Church . He composed 55 tracts and pamphlets condemning Protestantism , several of which were published in two folio volumes entitled Ecclesiologia ( trans . " The Words of the Church " ) . He is now remembered chiefly for his religious poetry , and in particular for two poetical works both published in 1657 : Heilige Seelenlust ( literally , " The Soul 's Holy Desires " ) , a collection of more than 200 religious hymn texts that have been used by Catholics and Protestants ; and Der <unk> Wandersmann ( " The Cherubinic Pilgrim " ) , a collection of 1 @,@ 676 short poems , mostly Alexandrine couplets . His poetry explores themes of mysticism , quietism , and pantheism within an orthodox Catholic context .

 = = = Early life and education = = = 
 While his exact birthdate is unknown , it is believed that Silesius was born in December 1624 in Breslau , the capital of Silesia . The earliest mention of him is the registration of his baptism on Christmas Day , 25 December 1624 . At the time , Silesia was a German @-@ speaking province of the Habsburg Empire . Today , it is the southwestern region of Poland . Baptized Johann Scheffler , he was the first of three children . His parents , who married in February 1624 , were Lutheran . His father , Stanislaus Scheffler ( c . 1562 â 1637 ) , was of Polish ancestry and was a member of the lower nobility . Stanislaus dedicated his life to the military was made Lord of <unk> ( or <unk> ) and received a knighthood from King Sigismund III . A few years before his son 's birth , he had retired from military service in KrakÃ³w . In 1624 , he was 62 . The child 's mother , Maria <unk> ( c . 1600 â 1639 ) , was a 24 @-@ year @-@ old daughter of a local physician with ties to the Habsburg Imperial court . 
 Scheffler obtained his early education at the <unk> ( Saint Elizabeth 's Gymnasium , or high school ) in Breslau . His earliest poems were written and published during these formative years . Scheffler was probably influenced by the recently published works of poet and scholar Martin Opitz and by one of his teachers , poet Christoph <unk> . 
 He subsequently studied medicine and science at the University of Strasbourg ( or Strassburg ) in Alsace for a year in 1643 . It was a Lutheran university with a course of study that embraced Renaissance humanism . From 1644 to 1647 , he attended Leiden University . At this time , he was introduced to the writings of Jacob BÃ¶hme ( 1575 â 1624 ) and became acquainted with one of BÃ¶hme 's friends , Abraham von Franckenberg ( 1593 â 1652 ) , who probably introduced him to ancient <unk> writings , alchemy , and hermeticism , and to mystic writers living in Amsterdam . Franckenberg had been compiling a complete edition of BÃ¶hme 's work at the time Scheffler resided in the Netherlands . The Dutch Republic provided refuge to many religious sects , mystics , and scholars who were persecuted elsewhere in Europe . Scheffler then went to Italy and enrolled in studies at the University of Padua in Padua in September 1647 . A year later , he received a doctoral degree in philosophy and medicine and returned to his homeland . 
 = = = Physician = = = 
 On 3 November 1649 , Scheffler was appointed to be the court physician to Silvius I Nimrod , Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg @-@ Oels ( 1622 â 1664 ) and was given an annual salary of 175 thalers . Although he was " recommended to the Duke on account of his good qualities and his experience in medicine , " it is likely that Scheffler 's friend and mentor , Abraham von Franckenberg , had arranged the appointment given his closeness to the Duke . Franckenberg was the son of a minor noble from the village of Ludwigsdorf near Oels within the duchy . Franckenberg returned to the region the year before . It is also possible that Scheffler 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Tobias BrÃ¼ckner , who was also a physician to the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg @-@ Oels , may have recommended him . Scheffler soon was not happy in his position as his personal mysticism and critical views on Lutheran doctrine ( especially his disagreements with the Augsburg Confession ) caused friction with the Duke and members of the ducal court . The Duke was characterized in history as being " a zealous Lutheran and very bigoted . " Coincidentally , it was at this time that Scheffler began to have mystical visions , which along with his public pronouncements led local Lutheran clergy to consider him a heretic . After Franckenberg 's death in June 1652 , Scheffler resigned his position â he may have been forced to resign â and sought refuge under the protection of the Roman Catholic Church . 
 = = = Priest and poet = = = 
 The Lutheran authorities in the Reformed states of the Empire were not tolerant of Scheffler 's increasing mysticism , and he was publicly attacked and denounced as a heretic . At this time , the Habsburg rulers ( who were Catholic ) were pushing for a Counter Reformation and advocated a re @-@ <unk> of Europe . Scheffler sought to convert to Catholicism and was received by the Church of Saint Matthias in Breslau on 12 June 1653 . Upon being received , he took the name Angelus , the Latin form of " angel " , derived from the Greek <unk> ( <unk> , " messenger " ) ; for his epithet , he took Silesius ( Latin for " Silesian " ) . It is uncertain why he took this name , but he may have added it in honour of his native Silesia or to honor a favourite scholastic , mystic or <unk> author , to distinguish himself from other famous writers of his era : perhaps the Spanish mystic writer Juan de los Ãngeles ( author of The Triumph of Love ) or Lutheran theologian Johann Angelus in Darmstadt . He no longer used the name Scheffler , but did on occasion use his first name , Johann . From 1653 until his death , he used the names Angelus Silesius and also Johann Angelus Silesius . 
 Shortly after his conversion , on 24 March 1654 , Silesius received an appointment as Imperial Court Physician to Ferdinand III , the Holy Roman Emperor . However , this was probably an honorary position to offer some official protection against Lutheran attackers , as Silesius never went to Vienna to serve the Imperial Court . It is very likely that he never practiced medicine after his conversion to Catholicism . 
 In the late 1650s , he sought permission ( a <unk> <unk> or imprimatur ) from Catholic authorities in Vienna and Breslau to begin publishing his poetry . He had begun writing poetry at an early age , publishing a few occasional pieces when a schoolboy in 1641 and 1642 . He attempted to publish poetry while working for the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg @-@ Oels , but was refused permission by the Duke 's orthodox Lutheran court clergyman , Christoph Freitag . However , in 1657 , after obtaining the approval of the Catholic Church , two collections of his poems were published â the works for which he is known â Heilige Seelenlust ( " The Soul 's Holy Desire " ) and Der <unk> Wandersmann ( " The Cherubinic Pilgrim " ) . 
 On 27 February 1661 , Silesius took holy orders as a Franciscan . Three months later , he was ordained a priest in the Silesian Duchy of Neisse â an area of successful re @-@ <unk> and one of two ecclesiastical states within the region ( that is , ruled by a Prince @-@ Bishop ) . When his friend Sebastian von Rostock ( 1607 â 1671 ) became Prince @-@ Bishop of Breslau , Silesius was appointed his Rath und <unk> ( a counselor and Chamberlain ) . During this time , he began publishing over fifty tracts attacking Lutheranism and the Protestant Reformation . Thirty @-@ nine of these essays he later compiled into a two @-@ volume folio collection entitled Ecclesiologia ( 1676 ) . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 After the death of the Prince @-@ Bishop of Breslau in 1671 , Silesius retired to the Hospice of the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star ( the <unk> ) , a Jesuit house associated with the church of Saint Matthias at Breslau . He died on 9 July 1677 and was buried there . Some sources claim he died from tuberculosis ( " consumption " ) , others describe his illness as a " wasting sickness . " Immediately after news of his death spread , several of his Protestant detractors spread the untrue rumor that Silesius had hanged himself . By his Will , he distributed his fortune , largely inherited from his father 's noble estate , to pious and charitable institutions , including orphanages . 
 = = Importance = = 
 = = = Interpretation of his work = = = 
 The poetry of Angelus Silesius consists largely of epigrams in the form of <unk> couplets â the style that dominated German poetry and mystical literature during the Baroque era . According to Baker , the epigram was key to conveying mysticism , because " the epigram with its tendency towards brevity and pointedness is a suitable genre to cope with the aesthetic problem of the ineffability of the mystical experience . " The Encyclopaedia <unk> identifies these epigrams as <unk> â or rhymed <unk> â and describes them as : 
 ... embodying a strange mystical pantheism drawn mainly from the writings of Jakob BÃ¶hme and his followers . Silesius delighted specially in the subtle paradoxes of mysticism . The essence of God , for instance , he held to be love ; God , he said , can love nothing inferior to himself ; but he cannot be an object of love to himself without going out , so to speak , of himself , without manifesting his infinity in a finite form ; in other words , by becoming man . God and man are therefore essentially one . 
 Silesius 's poetry directs the reader to seek a path toward a desired spiritual state , an eternal stillness , by eschewing material or physical needs and the human will . It requires an understanding of God that is informed by the ideas of apophatic theology and of antithesis and paradox . Some of Silesius 's writings and beliefs that bordered on pantheism or panentheism caused tensions between Silesius and local Protestant authorities . However , in the introduction to Der <unk> Wandersmann , he explained his poetry ( especially its paradoxes ) within the framework of Catholic orthodoxy and denied pantheism which would have run afoul of Catholic doctrine . 
 His mysticism is informed by the influences of BÃ¶hme and Franckenberg as well as of prominent writers Meister Eckhart ( 1260 â 1327 ) , Johannes <unk> ( c . 1300 â 1361 ) , Heinrich Suso ( c . 1300 â 1366 ) , and Jan van <unk> ( 1293 / 4 â 1381 ) . Critic and literary theorist Georg <unk> surmised in his study of Silesius that his poetry was influenced by loneliness ( especially due to the death of his parents and becoming an orphan early in life ) , ungoverned impulsivity , and lack of personal fulfillment , rendering much of his poetry confessional and exhibiting internal psychological conflict . 
 = = = Use in hymns = = = 
 Several of the poems of Silesius have been used or adapted as hymns used in Protestant and Catholic services . In many early Lutheran and Protestant hymnals , these lyrics were attributed to " anonymous " , rather than admit they were penned by the Catholic Silesius , known for his criticism and advocacy against Protestantism . In many instances , the verse of Silesius is attributed in print to " anonymous " or to " I.A. " While I.A. were the Latin initials for Iohannis Angelus they were often misinterpreted as <unk> <unk> , meaning " unknown author " . Likewise , several truly anonymous works were later misattributed to Silesius , thanks to the same ambiguous initials . Verses by Silesius appear in the lyrics of hymns published in NÃ¼rnberg Gesang @-@ Buch ( 1676 ) , <unk> 's Gesang @-@ Buch ( 1704 ) , <unk> 's Gesang @-@ Buch ( 1713 ) ; and Burg 's Gesang @-@ Buch ( 1746 ) . Seventy @-@ nine hymns using his verses were included in Nicolaus <unk> 's Christ @-@ <unk> Singe und Bet @-@ <unk> ( 1727 ) . During the 18th Century , they were frequently in use in the Lutheran , Catholic , and Moravian Churches . Many of these hymns are still popular in Christian churches today .

 In a series of lectures entitled Siete Noches ( " Seven Nights " ) ( 1980 ) , Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges ( 1899 â 1986 ) remarks that the essence of poetry can be encapsulated in a single line from Silesius . Borges wrote : 
 I will end with a great line by the poet who , in the seventeenth century , took the strangely real and poetic name of Angelus Silesius . It is the summary of all I have said tonight â except that I have said it by means of reasoning and simulated reasoning . I will say it first in Spanish and then in German : 
 La rosa es sin <unk> ; <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 Die Rose ist ohne warum ; sie blÃ¼het weil sie blÃ¼het . 
 The line he quoted , Die Rose ist ohne warum ; sie blÃ¼het , weil sie blÃ¼het ... from Silesius 's The Cherubinic Pilgrim ( 1657 ) , can be translated as : " The Rose is without a ' <unk> ' â she blooms because she blooms . " The influence of mysticism is seen in the work of Borges , especially in his poetry , which frequently references Silesius and his work . 
 This same line was often referenced in the work of Martin Heidegger ( 1889 â 1976 ) who ( building on the work of Leibniz and Hegel ) explored mysticism in many of his works , in which he defines a theory of truth as phenomenal and defying any rational explanation . Heidegger was commenting on the rational philosophy of German philosopher and mathematician Leibniz ( 1646 â 1716 ) â a contemporary of Silesius â who called the mystic 's poetry " beautiful " , but " extraordinarily daring , full of difficult metaphors and inclined almost to godlessness " despite Silesius 's mysticism being contrary to Leibniz 's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the Principle of sufficient reason . 
 In the 1991 American film Cape Fear directed by Martin Scorsese , Max Cady ( played by Robert De Niro ) quotes a verse of Silesius . The verse is : 
 However , the context of this line in the film does not match the context intended by Silesius . The character of Cady uses it to emphasize dramatically to his intended victims the power of his individual will and his god @-@ like ability to exact a violent vengeance . The context intended by Silesius was of man 's realization through his spiritual potential for perfection that he was of the same substance with God in the sense of the mystical divine union or theosis â that experience of direct communion of love between the believer and God as equals .

 = Battle of Chongju ( 1950 ) = 
 The Battle of Chongju ( 29 â 30 October 1950 ) took place during the United Nations ( UN ) offensive towards the Yalu River , which followed the North Korean invasion of South Korea at the start of the Korean War . The battle was fought between Australian forces from 3rd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 3 RAR ) and the 17th Tank Brigade of the Korean People 's Army for control of Chongju , North Korea and the surrounding area . After detecting a strong North Korean armoured force equipped with T @-@ 34 tanks and SU @-@ 76 self @-@ propelled guns on a thickly wooded ridgeline astride the line of advance , the Australians launched a series of company attacks with American M4 Sherman tanks and aircraft in support . Despite heavy resistance the North Koreans were forced to withdraw and the Australians captured their objectives after three hours of fighting . 
 That evening the North Koreans were strongly reinforced , attacking the Australian southern flank manned by D Company 3 RAR , and partially penetrating their perimeter . After two hours of fighting the assault was repulsed , and the North Koreans subsequently launched a furious assault against A Company 3 RAR on the northern position , which also failed amid heavy losses . The following day the Australians advanced to the high ground overlooking Chongju , killing and capturing a number of North Koreans in skirmishes . That afternoon the town itself was cleared by the remaining elements of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade without opposition . North Korean casualties during the fighting were heavy , while Australian losses included their commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green , who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and died two days later . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Military situation = = = 
 The Korean War began early in the morning of 25 June 1950 , following the surprise invasion of the Republic of Korea ( ROK ) by its northern neighbour , the communist Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) . Numerically superior and better @-@ equipped , the Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) crossed the 38th Parallel and rapidly advanced south , easily overcoming the South Koreans . In response , the United Nations ( UN ) decided to intervene on behalf of South Korea , inviting member states to send forces to restore the situation . As a consequence , American ground forces were hastily deployed in an attempt to prevent the South Koreans from collapsing , however they too were under strength and poorly equipped , and by early August had been forced back by the North Koreans to an enclave around Pusan , known as the Pusan Perimeter . Key US allies â Britain , Canada and Australia â also committed forces , although these were initially limited to naval contingents and were largely viewed as token efforts in the US . Under diplomatic pressure the British agreed to deploy an infantry brigade in July , and would later dispatch a second brigade as the crisis worsened . The Canadians also agreed to provide an infantry brigade , although the first battalion would not arrive until December 1950 . A total of 21 UN member states eventually contributed forces . 
 Australia was one of the first nations to commit units to the fighting , playing a small but sometimes significant part in the United Nations Command , which was initially led by General Douglas MacArthur . Forces deployed in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force formed the basis of the Australian response , with P @-@ 51 Mustang fighter @-@ bombers from No. 77 Squadron RAAF flying their first missions on 2 July , while the frigate HMAS Shoalhaven and the destroyer HMAS Bataan were also committed to naval operations . During this time the 3rd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 3 RAR ) , which had been preparing to return to Australia prior to the outbreak of the war , remained in Japan , however on 26 July the Australian government announced that it would also commit the understrength and poorly equipped infantry battalion to the fighting , following a period of preparation . Training and re @-@ equipment began immediately , while hundreds of reinforcements were hastily recruited in Australia as part of K Force ; they soon began arriving to fill out the battalion . The battalion 's commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Floyd Walsh , was subsequently replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green . An officer with extensive operational experience fighting the Japanese in New Guinea during the Second World War , Green took over from Walsh due to the latter 's perceived inexperience . 
 On 23 September 1950 , 3 RAR embarked for Korea , concentrating at Pusan on 28 September . There it joined the British 27th Infantry Brigade , a garrison formation hurriedly committed from Hong Kong by the British government as the situation deteriorated around the Pusan Perimeter in late August to bolster the US Eighth Army under Lieutenant General Walton Walker . Commanded by Brigadier Basil Coad , the brigade was renamed the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and consisted of the 1st Battalion , Argyll and Sutherland Highland Regiment ( 1 ASHR ) , the 1st Battalion , Middlesex Regiment ( 1 MR ) and 3 RAR . Under strength , the two British battalions had each mustered just 600 men of all ranks , while the brigade was also short on transport and heavy equipment , and had no integral artillery support , for which it would rely entirely on the Americans until the 16th Field Regiment , Royal New Zealand Artillery arrived in January 1951 . As such , with a strength of nearly 1 @,@ 000 men , the addition of 3 RAR gave the brigade increased tactical weight as well as expediently allowing the Australians to work within a familiar organisational environment , rather than being attached to a US formation . Also under the command of the brigade were a number of US Army units , including 155 mm howitzers from the US 90th Field Artillery Battalion , M4 Sherman tanks from US 89th Tank Battalion and a company from the US 72nd Combat Engineer Battalion .

 By the time 3 RAR arrived in the theatre , the North Koreans had been broken and were in rapid retreat , with MacArthur 's forces conducting a successful amphibious assault at Inchon and breaking out along the Naktong perimeter on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula . A steady advance began , driving the North Koreans northwards towards the 38th Parallel . The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was airlifted from Taegu to Kimpo Airfield north of Seoul on 5 October , however its vehicles had to move by road , driving 420 kilometres ( 260 mi ) , and did not arrive until 9 October . It was subsequently attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division , under the command of Major General Hobart R. Gay . On 16 October the brigade took over from the US 7th Cavalry Regiment as the vanguard of the UN advance up the west coast , its axis intended to take it through Kaesong , Kumchon and Hungsu @-@ ri to Sariwon , then through Hwangju to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang . Although the North Koreans had suffered heavily in the preceding weeks , they continued to resist strongly , while a lack of accurate maps and the narrowness of the roads made rapid movement difficult for the advancing UN forces . During this time 3 RAR had a platoon of American M4 Sherman tanks attached and a battery of field guns in direct support . 
 The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade subsequently moved 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) from Kumchon , with the Argylls capturing Sariwon on 17 October , killing 215 North Koreans and taking many prisoners for the loss of one man killed and three wounded . The brigade then passed to the command of the US 24th Infantry Division on 21 October , under the overall command of Major General John H. Church , while the US 1st Cavalry Division remained in Pyongyang to complete its capture . The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was subsequently ordered to seize Chongju . Consequently , the brigade continued to advance north with little respite , and on 22 October the Australians fought their first major action at Yongju , killing 150 North Koreans and capturing 239 of the brigade 's 800 prisoners , for the loss of seven men wounded . Intending to defeat the North Koreans and bring the war to a close , the UN forces pushed towards the Yalu River , on the Chinese border . Resistance continued to be met as the brigade crossed the Chongchon River however , and they now moved towards Pakchon . On 24 October , MacArthur had removed all restrictions on the movement of his forces south of the Yalu River and prepared for the final phase of the UN advance , defying a directive of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and risking Chinese intervention in support of North Korea . 
 On the afternoon of 25 October a platoon from 3 RAR was fired on by two companies of North Koreans as they crossed the Taeryong River to conduct a reconnaissance of the west bank , and although they were subsequently forced to withdraw , the Australians took 10 prisoners with them . Acting as the forward elements of the brigade , that evening Green sent two companies across the river to establish defensive positions , and they subsequently broke up a frontal assault on their positions with mortars while the North Koreans were in the process of forming up . Sixty North Koreans supported by a T @-@ 34 tank then attacked the forward Australian companies at Kujin early the following morning , resulting in Australian losses of eight killed and 22 wounded . However , the North Koreans suffered heavy casualties including over 100 killed and 350 captured , and the Australians subsequently succeeded in defending the bridgehead after the North Koreans withdrew . Intelligence indicated that the British and Australians were facing the North Korean 17th Tank Brigade , equipped with 20 tanks , which was preparing a last line of defence at Chongju , 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) away . Although the North Koreans had suffered heavy casualties during the previous fighting on the Taeryong River , Coad was now forced to adopt more cautious tactics , advancing in shorter bounds and clearing high points en route . On 27 October the Middlesex continued the advance and was involved in a sharp fight in the hills west of the river near the village of <unk> @-@ ni . With the war considered all but over the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade continued to pursue the North Koreans towards Chongju over the next three days , however the advance increasingly encountered strong resistance from North Korean infantry dug @-@ in with tanks and self @-@ propelled guns in support , as they approached the Yalu River on the Manchurian border .

 = = = Fighting around Chongju , 29 October 1950 = = = 
 3 RAR took over as lead battalion of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade on 29 October , 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) from Chongju . At 10 : 00 a US LT @-@ 6G Mosquito light spotter aircraft reported a large North Korean formation consisting of a battalion @-@ sized force of 500 â 600 infantry supported by several tanks and at least two self @-@ propelled guns , positioned on a thickly wooded ridgeline around Chongju . Astride the line of the advance , these positions were noted as being well constructed , camouflaged and dug @-@ in , with the North Koreans occupying positions on the forward slopes on both sides of the road . Airstrikes were called in and eight sorties were undertaken by United States Air Force ( USAF ) F @-@ 80 Shooting Stars which rocketed , strafed and <unk> the North Korean positions on the ridgelines . By 14 : 00 the pilots claimed to have destroyed seven T @-@ 34 tanks and two SU @-@ 76 self @-@ propelled guns , as well as causing many casualties among the North Korean forces . These claims proved optimistic however . With only a few hours of daylight remaining , Green then planned a battalion attack with two companies forward . Under the command of Major Walter Brown , D Company was subsequently ordered to attack the North Korean positions on the left of the road , followed by A Company commanded by Captain William Chitts , which would attack the right . Meanwhile , preparatory fire from the 155 mm <unk> of the US 90th Field Artillery Battalion and 3 @-@ inch mortars from Support Company 3 RAR began to fall on the North Korean positions . 
 At 14 : 30 , D Company launched an assault against the ridge south of the road , with two platoons of Sherman tanks in support from D Company , US 89th Tank Battalion . One tank platoon led the attack followed by the other carrying infantry from 10 Platoon D Company . Under the command of Lieutenant David Mannett , 10 Platoon made a right flanking assault along the road , while 11 and 12 Platoons attacked the ridge frontally across the paddy fields . Meeting stronger resistance than expected however , the attackers came under heavy fire and one of the Sherman tanks was knocked out by an armour @-@ piercing round that hit its turret . However , with the American tanks providing vital close support to the infantry , 10 Platoon successfully secured its objective , allowing it to take the North Koreans in enfilade and to provide fire support to the assault . Thus , despite strong opposition , the remainder of D Company gained the high ground by 16 : 30 . With the earlier airstrikes having been ineffective , D Company had been opposed by a number of T @-@ 34 tanks and SU @-@ 76 self @-@ propelled guns , however the bulk of these were destroyed by the Shermans during the assault . Another tank had been knocked out by well @-@ directed fire at point @-@ blank range from a Bren light machine @-@ gun by Private John Stafford , which caused the armoured vehicle 's auxiliary fuel tanks to ignite , resulting in its ammunition exploding . Stafford was subsequently awarded the US Silver Star for his bravery . 
 A Company attacked the ridgeline to the north of the road to <unk> just prior to dusk , this time without the support of the Sherman tanks . The Australians again came under heavy fire from the North Koreans , however they quickly overcame the defenders and the ridge was secured by 17 : 30 . During the fighting for the northern position , three North Korean T @-@ 34 tanks dug @-@ in on the ridgeline had been destroyed by the Australians at short range with new M20 3 @.@ 5 @-@ inch bazookas , which now proved to be effective anti @-@ armour weapons despite difficulties experienced in their use at Kujin several days before . During the day 's fighting , a total of 11 T @-@ 34 tanks and two SU @-@ 76 self @-@ propelled guns had been destroyed by the Australian infantry and American tanks , contrary to the reports of their destruction by USAF airstrikes earlier in the day . Expecting a counter @-@ attack , Green then ordered B Company forward to occupy positions along the road in between the positions held by D and A Companies , while Battalion headquarters moved in behind B Company , with C Company held in reserve at the rear with Support Company . After conducting a limited resupply of the forward companies , the Australians hastily began to dig in . 
 The North Koreans subsequently brought up substantial reinforcements , and soon after dark they moved against D Company on the southern flank . Preparatory fire by artillery , mortars and machine @-@ guns began at 19 : 00 , following which a battalion @-@ sized ground assault was launched . The weight of the counter @-@ attack fell on 10 Platoon D Company , with Mannett holding his platoon 's fire until the North Koreans were only 10 metres ( 33 ft ) away before engaging , killing 32 men . Mannett was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership during the initial assault and the subsequent defence of the ridgeline . Regardless , the North Koreans succeeded in overrunning parts of the Australian position before they were finally repulsed following counter @-@ attacks by 11 and 12 Platoons during two hours of fierce fighting . A number of North Koreans also succeeded in penetrating the perimeter , and they moved behind D Company from where they fired on the 3 RAR headquarters . Contact was subsequently lost with D Company and was not regained until the North Koreans were forced to withdraw by Headquarters Company , under Captain Ben O 'Dowd , which then cleared the depth positions . At 21 : 30 the focus of the North Korean counter @-@ attack shifted to the northern flank , launching a heavy assault against A Company . This effort also failed however , being repulsed as Chitts called @-@ in indirect fire from the Support Company mortars and American howitzers to within 10 metres ( 33 ft ) of the forward Australian positions . The North Koreans finally withdrew at 22 : 15 , though a SU @-@ 76 self @-@ propelled gun continued to fire sporadically into the Australian positions until 23 : 00 .

 The following morning the Australians remained in position , and at daybreak they found more than 150 North Korean dead within the 3 RAR defensive position . Coad subsequently brought the Middlesex forward to secure his northern flank , while 3 RAR moved forward to the <unk> River , taking up positions in the hills overlooking Chongju by 11 : 00 . During the advance the Australians had clashed with a number of North Korean stragglers , killing 12 and capturing 10 in skirmishes . It became clear that organised resistance had ceased however , with the successful Australian assault and the subsequent defence of its objectives the day before breaking the North Koreans locally . In the north the Middlesex pushed forward to the riverbank , while in the afternoon the Argylls forded the river with two platoons of Shermans . Meanwhile , aerial reconnaissance reported the presence of North Korean tanks to the west of Chongju . Regardless , that afternoon the Argylls encountered no further opposition as they entered and cleared the ruined and burning town , securing it by 17 : 00 . The brigade then moved into divisional reserve for the US 24th Infantry Division , with Church ordering the US 21st Infantry Regiment to take its place in the lead in order to give the British and Australian infantry a much needed respite . The tanks and infantry of the US 21st Infantry Regiment subsequently moved through the brigade . 
 The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade adopted tight security that evening due to the threat of North Korean infiltration . For added protection while in reserve the 3 RAR headquarters had been sited on the reverse slope of a hill overlooking the <unk> River , with the rifle companies occupying the forward slope of the ridgeline to the west and a spur line which thrust towards the river bank . Around dusk at 18 : 10 on 30 October , six high @-@ velocity shells , likely from a North Korean self @-@ propelled gun or tank , hit the area . Five of the shells landed on the forward slope , while the sixth cleared the crest and detonated to the rear of the C Company position after hitting a tree . In his tent on a stretcher after 36 hours without sleep , Green was severely wounded in the stomach by a fragment from the wayward round . He was evacuated to a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital ( MASH ) at Anju , however he succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 November , and was subsequently interred at Pusan . Forty other men who had been in the vicinity when the shell landed were unhurt . A popular and respected commanding officer , Green 's loss was keenly felt by the Australians . Meanwhile , Coad received congratulations from Gay for the brigade 's victory at Chongju after marching 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) in twelve hours .

 = = = Casualties = = = 
 The fighting around Chongju was the heaviest undertaken by the Australians since entering the war . North Korean casualties included 162 killed and 10 captured , while Australian losses were nine killed and 30 wounded , including Green . The Royal Australian Regiment was subsequently granted the battle honour " Chongju " . Following the capture of the town the US 21st Infantry Regiment had set off rapidly along the road to Sonchon to the west . Encountering only one strong North Korean position which they quickly turned , by noon on 1 November the lead battalion had reached Chonggodong , just 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) from the Yalu River where the Americans clashed with another North Korean armoured force . To the north meanwhile , the US 5th and 9th Infantry Regiments of the 24th Division secured Taechon and Kusong , before advancing to within 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) of the Manchurian border . 
 = = = Subsequent operations = = = 
 During the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions of the People 's Volunteer Army across the Yalu River under the overall command of Marshal Peng Dehuai in order to reinforce the remnants of the KPA . Undetected by US and South Korean intelligence , the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) into North Korea , and were reinforced in early November by 12 divisions from the 9th Army Group ; in total 30 divisions composed of 380 @,@ 000 men . The Chinese subsequently ambushed MacArthur 's forces which were now widely dispersed , decimating ROK II Corps at Onjong and encircling and overrunning the US 8th Cavalry Regiment at Unsan . Ultimately Chongju was the furthest north that 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was to penetrate , and on 1 November the brigade began moving south as part of the United Nations general withdrawal in the face of the Chinese First Phase Offensive . Walsh , by then an observer at US Eighth Army headquarters , was urgently posted to resume command of 3 RAR following Green 's death , however he was relieved of his position by Coad just six days later in the wake of the Battle of Pakchon on 5 November that cost the battalion heavily , losing 12 killed and 64 wounded despite killing 200 Chinese . The battalion second @-@ in @-@ command , Major Bruce Ferguson , subsequently assumed command . Suffering significant casualties , the Chinese offensive was halted the next day due to logistics difficulties . 
 Between 6 â 25 November 3 RAR remained in the Pakchon area , conducting extensive patrolling to secure the area. small groups of Chinese and North Koreans were captured . As winter approached the weather became colder and the Australians increasingly suffered health and maintenance problems , before additional US cold clothing and equipment was issued . The United Nations subsequently resumed the offensive again on 24 November . Meanwhile , the Chinese began their Second Phase Offensive , with the Chinese 13th Army Group pushing the US Eighth Army back to the Chongchon River , inflicting heavy losses on the South Koreans and decimating the US 2nd Infantry Division on the right flank as the US Eighth Army began a long retreat . At the same time , the Chinese 9th Army Group ambushed the US X Corps near the Chosin Reservoir as the freezing winter weather set in . Although the US Eighth Army succeeded in avoiding encirclement , the US X Corps had to be evacuated by sea from Hungnam during December 1950 , despite inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese . MacArthur 's forces were subsequently expelled from North Korea , and withdrew to the 38th Parallel where they sought to once again establish defensive positions .

He crashes down the stairwell of the Legitimate Businessman 's Social Club , a Mafia bar owned by the Springfield Mafia . Fat Tony , the leader of the Mafia , and his henchmen Legs and Louie are initially inhospitable towards Bart , but they are impressed by his ability to pick the winning horse in a horse race on television .

 Judge Snyder is about to convict Bart when Skinner bursts through the doors , disheveled and unshaven , and explains that neither Bart nor the mobsters assaulted him . Rather , when Fat Tony and his henchmen had come to his office meekly , Skinner had yelled at them to not interfere with student discipline , and they left sheepishly . After Skinner returned to his house , he became trapped beneath tons of old newspapers in his garage , and was stuck there for over a week , until he was able to escape . Bart is cleared of all charges despite counsel for the prosecution unsuccessfully trying to convince the Judge to strike Skinner 's speech from the record . Fat Tony tells Bart that he did not want to get him into any trouble on his behalf , but Bart decides to resign after learning that " crime doesn 't pay " .

 The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Rich Moore . The writers conceived the idea of the episode before the 1990 film GoodFellas , which has a similar plot , was released . After it was , the writers incorporated references to the film into the episode . The character Fat Tony makes his first appearance on the show in this episode . He was modeled after the physical appearance of Paul Sorvino 's character Paul Cicero in GoodFellas . 
 The writers originally wanted American actor Sheldon Leonard to voice Fat Tony , but they were unable to get him , so they went with Joe Mantegna instead . Mantegna was offered the role during the show 's second season , and since he had seen the show before and thought it was " funny " , he decided to give it a shot . He felt honored that they asked him to do a voice for the show . In an interview with The A.V. Club , Mantegna said he thinks the reason he got the role was partly due to his performance in the 1990 Mafia film The Godfather Part III , which opened just prior to when he received the role . He thought the script was smart and clever and that he enjoyed recording it . Mantegna has since appeared many times on the show as Fat Tony , who became a recurring character ; it is Mantegna 's longest @-@ running role in his acting career . Mantegna commented : " Who knew that Fat Tony was gonna resonate in the hearts and minds of the [ Simpsons fans ] out there ? Apparently [ the writers ] got enough feedback as to how the character was liked that they wrote it in again and again , and I was kind of a recurring guy that they â d tap into at least a couple episodes a season . " 
 Legs and Louie , Fat Tony 's henchmen , also made their first appearances in this episode . The character of Louie was based on American actor Joe Pesci , who is known for playing violent Mafia mobsters . Neil Patrick Harris guest starred in the episode as himself , portraying Bart in Blood on the Blackboard : The Bart Simpson Story , a horribly inaccurate made @-@ for @-@ television film based on Bart 's life with the Mafia that the Simpson family watches at the end of the episode . The movie casts Joe Mantegna ( looking like his character in The Godfather Part III ) as Fat Tony . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The sequence of Bart crashing down the stairwell to the Mafia bar is similar to a scene in the film GoodFellas , in which a young boy is employed by a Mafia as their messenger . All of the horses in the race that Bart bets on are named after a famous animated character 's catchphrase : " Ain 't I a <unk> ? " ( Bugs Bunny ) , " <unk> <unk> Doo " ( Fred Flintstone ) , " <unk> ' <unk> " ( Sylvester ) , " That 's All Folks " ( Porky Pig ) , " I Yam What I Yam " ( Popeye ) , and Bart 's catchphrases " Eat my shorts " and " Don 't have a cow " . The Chiffons 's song " One Fine Day " is heard when Bart serves drinks to the mobsters during a game of poker . The writers originally wanted to use the song " Be My Baby " by The Ronettes for the scene , but they could not clear the copyrights for it . In his room , Bart stores the Springfield Mafia 's loot â a truckload of cartons of Laramie cigarettes . While strutting around the kitchen , he sings Frank Sinatra 's song " Witchcraft " . The scene in which Bart wakes up screaming after having a nightmare about Skinner is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film The Godfather , in which Jack Woltz screams after waking up in bed and finding a decapitated horse head by his side . Skinner frees himself from being trapped under the newspapers in a way similar to the character Angus MacGyver 's escapes in the American television series MacGyver .

It was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week . Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . John <unk> of Vanity Fair named it the eighth best episode of The Simpsons because of the " inspired " Mafia satire and because it " goes deeper into Bart 's ongoing conflict with authority figures . " Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , praised the scene in which Skinner explains his disappearance to the courtroom , calling it Skinner 's " finest hour " on the show . Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed named the episode the best in the third season , and commented that there are " many priceless moments " in it , such as Homer 's meeting with the Springfield Mafia . Meyers also praised Swartzwelder 's script . Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict commented that how an episode that starts with Bart having a bad day can lead to him being tried for murder as the head of the local Mafia " is just one of the amazing monuments to this show 's superiority . " 
 DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson thought " Bart the Murderer " was season three 's first " truly great " episode because it " starts off strong and gets even better as it moves . " Even though he thinks Mafia parodies have been overused , Jacobson thought this one brought " a fresh approach and remains consistently amusing . A great guest spot from Mantegna helps . It also feels like the first episode of this season that really moves the series ahead ; it seems like something a little more incisive than most of what came before it . " Andy Patrizio of IGN called " Bart the Murderer " his favorite of the season , and praised the episode for its references to The Godfather and MacGyver . The episode 's reference to GoodFellas was named the 28th greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Film 's Nathan Ditum .

Nevertheless , Meshuggah has begun to gain attention and respect among more mainstream audiences since the late 2000s , having also inspired the djent movement within progressive metal . 
 Since its formation , Meshuggah has released seven studio albums , six EPs and eight music videos . The band has performed in various international festivals , including Ozzfest and Download , and embarked on the obZen world tour from 2008 to 2010 . Meshuggah 's latest studio album , Koloss , was released on March 23 , 2012 . Nothing and the albums that followed have all charted on the Billboard 200 . Meshuggah 's most commercially successful album , Koloss , debuted at number 17 in the USA , with first week sales of 18 @,@ 342 copies . In 2006 and 2009 , the band was nominated for a Swedish Grammy Award .

 In 1985 , guitarist Fredrik Thordendal formed a band in UmeÃ¥ , a college town in northern Sweden with a population of 105 @,@ 000 . The band , originally named <unk> , recorded a number of demo tapes , after which it disbanded . Thordendal , however , continued playing under a different name with new band members . 
 Meshuggah was formed in 1987 by vocalist and guitarist Jens Kidman , and took the name Meshuggah from the Yiddish word for " crazy " . The band recorded several demos before Kidman left , which prompted the remaining members to disband . Kidman then formed a new band , <unk> , with guitarist Thordendal , bassist Peter Nordin and drummer Niklas Lundgren . Kidman , who also played guitar , and Thordendal decided to restore the name Meshuggah for the new band . 
 On February 3 , 1989 , Meshuggah released the self @-@ titled , three @-@ song EP Meshuggah , which is commonly known as <unk> <unk> ( a title that could be translated as " Psychological Test @-@ Picture " ) . This 12 " ( 30 cm ) vinyl EP had only 1 @,@ 000 copies released , sold by local record store <unk> . The EP 's back cover features the band members with cheese doodles on their faces . 
 After replacing drummer Niklas Lundgren with Tomas Haake in 1990 , Meshuggah signed a contract with German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast and recorded its debut full @-@ length album , Contradictions Collapse . The LP , originally entitled ( All this because of ) Greed , was released on January 1 , 1991 . The album received positive reviews , but was not a commercial success . Soon after , Kidman decided to concentrate on vocals , and rhythm guitarist MÃ¥rten HagstrÃ¶m , who had already played in a band with Haake when they were in sixth grade , was recruited . The new lineup recorded the EP None at <unk> Recordings in UmeÃ¥ in 1994 for release later that year . A Japanese version was also released , including lyrics printed in Japanese . 
 During this period , Thordendal , who was working as a carpenter , severed the tip of his left middle finger , while Haake injured his hand in a grinder accident . As a result , the band was unable to perform for several months . Thordendal 's fingertip was later reattached , and he went on to make a full recovery . The <unk> EP was recorded in April and May 1994 , but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents . 
 = = = Destroy Erase Improve ( 1995 â 1997 ) = = = 
 In January 1995 , Meshuggah undertook a short European tour organized by its record label Nuclear Blast . Afterwards , the band returned to the studio to record the album Destroy Erase Improve at <unk> Studios in Uppsala , with Daniel <unk> as a producer . Shortly thereafter , the band went on a European tour supporting Machine Head for two months . During the tour , Nordin became ill and experienced difficulties with his inner ear balance . Due to the resulting chronic dizziness and vertigo , Nordin was forced to leave the tour and travel to Sweden . Machine Head 's bassist Adam Duce offered to cover his absence ; however , Meshuggah decided to continue as a four @-@ piece . Sometimes Thordendal played bass , while other times the band performed with two guitars . In this lineup , HagstrÃ¶m would use a pitch shifter to play his guitar at an octave lower than usual . 
 Destroy Erase Improve was released in July 1995 , with positive response from critics for the " heady tempos and abstract approach " . Kidman described the album cover : " The title fits the pictures we cut out and stole from reference books in the library . " 
 In mid @-@ 1995 , Meshuggah had a short tour with Swedish band Clawfinger in Scandinavia and Germany . Nordin had to leave the band because of his sickness and was replaced by bassist Gustaf Hielm during the tour . In late 1995 , Meshuggah went on a month @-@ long tour with Hypocrisy . 
 During 1996 and 1997 , Thordendal worked on his solo album Sol Niger Within , which was released in March 1997 in Scandinavia and in April in Japan . He also hosted Mats / Morgan Band 's debut . In 1997 , Meshuggah recorded an unreleased demo , toured occasionally , and played a few concerts in its hometown . In May , Meshuggah moved to Stockholm to be closer to its management and the record industry in general . 
 The EP The True Human Design was recorded and released in late 1997 . It contained one new song entitled " Sane " , and one live and two alternate versions of Destroy Erase Improve 's opening track " Future Breed Machine " . Thordendal 's solo album Sol Niger Within was simultaneously released in the United States , and Meshuggah started to plan its next album at the end of the year . 
 = = = Chaosphere and Nothing ( 1998 â 2002 ) = = = 
 Hielm officially joined the band in January 1998 after more than two years as a session member . Nuclear Blast re @-@ released Contradictions Collapse with the addition of songs from the None EP . In May 1998 , the title of the next album , Chaosphere , was reported and recording began . Immediately after recording the album , Meshuggah went on a short US tour , and the album was released later in November 1998 . Shortly after the release , Meshuggah toured Scandinavia with Entombed . 
 In early 1999 , Meshuggah joined Slayer on their U.S. tour . After the new album and the live performances , Meshuggah was beginning to be recognized by mainstream music , guitar , drum and metal magazines . In mid @-@ 1999 , Meshuggah performed in several Swedish concerts . The band started to write some new material but reported in mid @-@ 2000 that " songwriting isn 't that dramatic , but we 're getting there slowly " . While fans were waiting for the next album , a collection of demos ( from the <unk> <unk> EP ) , remixes and unreleased songs from the Chaosphere sessions were released as the Rare Trax album . Hielm left the band in July 2001 for unclear reasons . Meshuggah joined Tool on a lengthy tour , playing for more than 100 @,@ 000 people total . 
 In March 2002 , Meshuggah recorded three @-@ track demos with programmed drums in their home studio , which were based on Haake 's sample <unk> from Hell . The upcoming album was recorded in five to six weeks in May and was produced by the band at Dug @-@ Out Studios in Uppsala and at its home studio in Stockholm . The last @-@ minute decision to join 2002 's Ozzfest tour forced the band to mix the album in two days and master it in one . Meshuggah immediately went on another US tour after finishing the recording . 
 The album Nothing was released in August 2002 , selling 6 @,@ 525 copies during its first week in the US and reaching No. 165 on the Billboard 200 . With this album , Meshuggah became the first band in the history of Nuclear Blast Records to crack the Billboard 200 and also became the first band signed to Nuclear Blast to be reviewed in Rolling Stone magazine . Meshuggah 's previous two releases , 1998 's Chaosphere and 1995 's Destroy Erase Improve , have sold 38 @,@ 773 and 30 @,@ 712 copies to that date , respectively . The CD booklet of Nothing has no liner notes , lyrics , or credits , only a hint of one word : <unk> , which is Swedish for nothing . All of this information is available on the CD @-@ ROM . At the end of 2002 , the band went on another US tour with Tool and a headlining tour of its own . 
 = = = I and Catch Thirtythree ( 2003 â 2006 ) = = = 
 In 2003 , HagstrÃ¶m hinted at the direction of the band 's next album by saying , " There 's only one thing I really feel that is important . We 've never measured our success in terms of sales , because we 're quite an extreme band . It 's more that people understand where we 're coming from . I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we 've totally changed their way of looking on metal music , than having like 200 kids buy it . I mean , it would be nice for the money , but that 's not why we 're in it . So what I 'd like to see is that we keep progressing . Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been , but exploring the bar , so to speak . Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band , Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness , the all @-@ out side , and Nothing is more of a sinister , dark , pretty slow album , actually . So honestly , now I don 't know where we 're going . It might be a mix of all of them . " 
 In February 2004 , bassist Dick <unk> joined Meshuggah . The band then recorded and released the I EP , which contains a single , 21 @-@ minute track , released on Fractured Transmitter Records . Meshuggah spent about six months in total on recording the EP . Catch Thirtythree , the only Meshuggah album on which programmed drums have been used , was released the following year in May 2005 . Seven thousand copies of Catch Thirtythree were sold the first week , and it debuted at No. 170 on the Billboard 200 chart in June 2005 . The video for the track " Shed " was released in June , and the previous album Nothing sold approximately 80 @,@ 000 copies in the United States to that date , according to Nielsen SoundScan . Catch Thirtythree earned the band a Swedish Grammy nomination . 
 In December 2005 , 10 years after signing its first record deal with the publishing company Warner / Chappell Music Scandinavia , Meshuggah extended its cooperation with the company . In November 2005 , Haake said in an interview that the band was not content with the productions of Chaosphere and Nothing , because , being on tour , they had little time to devote to them . 
 A remixed and remastered version of Nothing with rerecorded guitars was released in a custom @-@ shaped slipcase featuring a three @-@ dimensional hologram card on October 31 , 2006 , via Nuclear Blast Records . The release also includes a bonus DVD featuring the band 's appearance at the Download 2005 festival and the official music videos of " Rational Gaze " , " Shed " and " New Millennium Cyanide Christ " .

 Meshuggah returned to the studio to record obZen , which was released in March 2008 . The band spent almost a year on the album , its longest recording session yet . A significant portion of the year was spent learning to perform the songs they wrote ; the recording itself took six <unk> obZen reached No. 59 on the Billboard 200 chart , selling 11 @,@ 400 U.S. copies in its first week of release and 50 @,@ 000 copies after six months . With obZen , Meshuggah received more media attention and attracted new fans . The release was followed by a world tour , which started in the U.S. and proceeded to Europe , Asia and Australia . 
 In May 2008 , Meshuggah published a music video for the song " Bleed " , which was produced by Ian McFarland and was written , directed and edited by Mike Pecci and Ian McFarland . Killswitch Productions said : " It 's extremely cool to work with a band who is willing to allow the music and imagery to speak for itself and who does not insist on themselves being the prominent focus of the video . " 
 In January 2009 , obZen was nominated for the Swedish Grammis award in the " Best Hard Rock " category . In February 2009 , Haake announced that the band was planning a concert DVD and a studio album . In April , Meshuggah was forced to cancel its Scandinavian shows in early 2009 , due to Haake 's herniated disc in his lower back , which was causing problems with his right foot when playing . Haake later underwent a surgery and recovered for European summer festivals . 
 The concert DVD entitled Alive was released on February 5 , 2010 in Europe and February 9 in North America . Thordendal started to work on a second solo album in June 2010 with the Belgian drummer Dirk Verbeuren . 
 The newest studio album , Koloss , was released on March 23 , 2012 in Germany , on March 26 in the rest of Europe , and March 27 in North America . Koloss reached No. 17 on the Billboard Top 200 , and sold 18 @,@ 342 copies in its first week . In Sweden , it reached No. 12 . 
 On February 5 , 2013 , Meshuggah released a free two @-@ track EP entitled Pitch Black with Scion A / V. The EP features a previously unreleased track , " Pitch Black " , that was recorded by Fredrik Thordendal in 2003 at Fear and Loathing , in Stockholm Sweden . The second track is a live recording of " Dancers to a Discordant System " from obZen . The track was recorded at Distortion Fest in Eindhoven , Netherlands , on December 9 , 2012 . 
 On May 12 , 2016 , Meshuggah released a teaser video on their YouTube page and confirmed that their next studio album is to be released in late 2016 . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 = = = Genre and typical traits = = = 
 Meshuggah 's experimentation , stylistic variation and changes during its career cross several musical subgenres . Heavy metal subgenres avant @-@ garde metal or experimental metal are umbrella terms that enable description of the career of the band in general . Extreme metal crosses both thrash metal and death metal ( or technical death metal ) , which are at root of the sound of Meshuggah 's music , which has also been described as groove metal . The band is often labelled as math metal ( for using elements of math rock ) and progressive metal . Meshuggah also incorporates elements of experimental jazz . In its review of Nothing , Allmusic describes Meshuggah as " masterminds of cosmic calculus metal â call it Einstein metal if you want " . Meshuggah 's early output was also considered alternative metal . Meshuggah creates a recognizable sonic imprint and distinct style . 
 Trademarks and characteristics that define Meshuggah 's sound and songwriting include polyrhythms , <unk> riff cycles , rhythmic syncopation , rapid key and tempo changes and neo @-@ jazz <unk> . HagstrÃ¶m notes that " it doesn 't really matter if something is hard to play or not . The thing is , what does it do to your mind when you listen to it ? Where does it take you ? " A trademark of Thordendal is jazz fusion @-@ like soloing and improvisation . He is also known for the usage of a " breath controller " device . Haake is known for his cross @-@ rhythm drumming with " <unk> cadence " . The vocal style of Jens Kidman varies between hardcore @-@ style shouts and " robotic " death metal vocals . 
 In <unk> typically used by Meshuggah , the guitars might play in odd meters such as 5 / 16 or 17 / 16 , while drums play in 4 / 4 . One particular example of Haake 's use of <unk> is 4 / 4 against 23 / 16 <unk> , in which he keeps the hi @-@ hat and ride cymbal in 4 / 4 time but uses the snare and double bass drums in 23 / 16 time . On " Rational Gaze " ( from Nothing ) , Haake plays simple 4 / 4 time , hitting the snare on each third beat , for 16 bars . At the same time , the guitars and bass are playing same quarter notes , albeit in a different time signature ; eventually both sides meet up again at the 64th beat . HagstrÃ¶m notes about the <unk> , " We 've never really been into the odd time signatures we get accused of using . Everything we do is based around a 4 / 4 core . It 's just that we arrange parts differently around that center to make it seem like something else is going on . " 
 = = = Early work , Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere = = = 
 The early work of Meshuggah , influenced mainly by Metallica , is " simpler and more straightforward than their more recent material , but some of their more progressive elements are present in the form of time @-@ changes and <unk> , and Fredrik Thordendal 's lead playing stands out " . According to Allmusic , their debut album is a relatively immature , but original , release . Double bass drums and " angular " riffing also defined the early work of Meshuggah . 
 With the groundbreaking Destroy Erase Improve , Meshuggah showed fusion of death metal , thrash metal , progressive metal and technical polyrhythmic math metal . Allmusic describes the style as " weaving hardcore @-@ style shouts amongst deceptively ( and deviously ) simple staccato guitar riffs and insanely precise drumming â often with all three components acting in different time signatures " . Thordendal adds the melodic element with his typical lead guitar and uses his " breath controller " device most famously on the opening track " Future Breed Machine " . 
 Chaosphere incorporates typically fast , still tempo changing death metal . Allmusic compares the genre also with grindcore fathers Napalm Death . <unk> states : " Whilst fans reveled in the maze like meanderings , critics struggled to dissect and analyze , hailing Haake 's unconventional use of dual 4 / 4 and 23 / 16 rhythm , Kidman 's mechanical staccato bark and Thordendal 's liberal usage of avant @-@ garde jazz " . 
 = = = Nothing , I and Catch Thirtythree = = = 
 On Nothing , Meshuggah abandons the fast tempos of Chaosphere and concentrates on slow , tuned down tempos and grooves . The album was intended to be recorded using custom @-@ made <unk> eight @-@ string guitars , but the prototypes were faulty so Thordendal and HagstrÃ¶m used detuned Ibanez seven @-@ string guitars instead . This technique , which involved keeping the instruments <unk> during the sessions , created additional problems . When Ibanez provided Meshuggah with special eight @-@ string guitars with two extra @-@ low strings that worked properly after the initial release , the band re @-@ recorded the guitar parts for Nothing and re @-@ released it in 2006 . HagstrÃ¶m notes that this allowed the band to go lower sonically and to attain bass sounds on guitars . 
 The I EP contains a single , 21 @-@ minute song of complex arrangements and was a hint of the forthcoming album , 2005 's Catch Thirtythree . The EP , which was never played live by the band , was written and recorded during jamming sessions of Haake and Thordendal . On Catch Thirtythree , Meshuggah again used eight @-@ string guitars , but utilized programmed drums for the first time also for the release , with the exception of two songs from 2001 's compilation Rare Trax . The album was self @-@ produced by the band and was recorded at the studio that Meshuggah shares with Clawfinger . HagstrÃ¶m notes , " The eight @-@ strings really have given us a whole new musical vocabulary to work with . Part of it is the restrictions they impose : you really can 't play power chords with them ; the sound just turns to mush . Instead , we concentrated on coming up with really unusual single @-@ note parts , new tunings and chord voicings . We wanted to get as far away from any kind of conventions and traditions as we could on the album , so the guitars worked out beautifully . " 
 Catch Thirtythree is one 47 @-@ minute song divided into 13 sections . It is more mid @-@ tempo guitar riff based , and a more straightforward and experimental full @-@ length album than Chaosphere or Nothing . Nick Terry of Decibel Magazine describes the album as a four @-@ movement symphony . Some songs still use Meshuggah 's " familiar template combining harsh vocals and nightmarish melodies over coarse , mechanically advancing , oddball tempos " , while others explore ambient sounds and quieter dynamics . The first part of Catch Thirtythree centers around two simple riffs . In the song " In Death - Is Death " , the band uses a combination of noise and silence , which is in contrast with the atypical melodies on " <unk> " . On " Mind 's Mirrors " , Meshuggah used electronics , programming and " robotic voices " . " Shed " incorporates tribal percussion and whispered vocals . 
 = = = obZen = = = 
 With 2008 's obZen , Meshuggah moved away from the experimentation of 2002 's Nothing and 2005 's Catch Thirtythree to return to the musical style of its previous albums , such as Contradictions Collapse , Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere , while still maintaining its focus on musical and technical innovation . The album loses some of the mathematical @-@ like <unk> quick changes of past releases and the melodic orchestration of Catch Thirty @-@ Three and uses " angular " riffs , mid @-@ tempo and common 4 / 4 beats . The album is a culmination of the band 's previous work . Meshuggah decided to self @-@ produce because it sought to retain artistic control over the recording and mixing process . 
 For obZen , Haake returned to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song " Bleed " . In an interview for <unk> , Haake stated , " [ ' Bleed ' ] was a big effort for me to learn , I had to find a totally new approach to playing the double bass drums to be able to do that stuff . I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically . So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined . It 's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I 'm glad we were able to nail it for the album . For a while though we didn 't even know if it was going to make it to the album . " HagstrÃ¶m also stated , " obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape " . Revolver magazine confirms this statement : " At first listen , obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band 's other records , and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next . However , careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group 's most complicated " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Meshuggah has become known for its innovative musical style that evolves between each release and pushes heavy metal into new territory , and for its technical prowess . HagstrÃ¶m comments : " We try never to repeat ourselves . " <unk> stated about Destroy Erase Improve : " [ T ] he band ... stripped Metal down to the bare essentials before completely rebuilding it in a totally abstract form " . The official Meshuggah biography comments on Chaosphere by noting that " Some fans felt that Meshuggah had left their dynamic and progressive elements behind ; while others thought they were only progressing naturally and focusing on their original sound . " The band 's website also describes Nothing as displaying " a very mature and convincing Meshuggah , now focusing on groove and sound ... Meshuggah once again divided their fans into the ' ecstatic ' and the ' slightly disappointed ' " . The polyrhythms can make the music sound cacophonous , like band members are playing different songs simultaneously . Listeners perceiving a polyrhythm often either extract a composite pattern that is fitted to a metric framework , or focus on one rhythmic stream while treating others as " noise " . 
 Rolling Stone labeled Meshuggah as " one of the ten most important hard and heavy bands " , and the Alternative Press named it the " most important band in metal . " Meshuggah has been described as virtuoso or genius @-@ bordering musicians , " recognized by mainstream music magazines , especially those dedicated to particular instruments " . In 2007 , Meshuggah earned an in @-@ depth analysis by the academic journal Music Theory Spectrum . Meshuggah has found little mainstream success but is a significant act in extreme underground music and an influence for many modern metal bands . According to guardian.co.uk , Meshuggah coined the onomatopoeic term " djent " , describing an " elastic , syncopated guitar riff " , that later gave a name to the microgenre . 
 = = Songwriting , recording and lyrics = = 
 Meshuggah 's music is written by Thordendal , HagstrÃ¶m and Haake with assistance from Kidman . During songwriting , a member programs the drums , and records the guitar and bass via computer . He presents his idea to the other members as a finished work . Meshuggah typically adheres to the original idea and rarely changes the song afterwards . HagstrÃ¶m explains that each member has an idea of what the others are doing conceptually , and nobody thinks exclusively in terms of a particular instrument . Kidman does not play guitar in the band anymore , but he is involved in writing riffs . 
 Except for when HagstrÃ¶m needs a soloist , he and Thordendal rarely record together . Both play guitar and bass while composing . Haake says about his songwriting , " Sometimes I 'll sample guitar parts , cut them up , pitch @-@ shift and tweak them until I 've built the riffs I want , just for demoing purposes . But most of the time I 'll just present the drums , and explain my ideas for the rest of the song , sing some riffs . " The band uses Cubase to record the tracks , and the guitars are routed through software amplifier modeling , because it allows them to change the amp settings even after the song was fully recorded . 
 Approximately once a year , Haake writes most of the band 's lyrics , with the exception of finished tracks . His lyrical inspirations are derived from books and films . Although Meshuggah does not record concept albums , the band prefers strong conceptual underpinnings in the background . 
 Often esoteric and conceptual , Meshuggah 's lyrics explore themes such as existentialism . Allmusic describes Destroy Erase Improve 's lyrical focus as " the integration of machines with organisms as humanity 's next logical evolutionary step " . PopMatters ' review of Nothing singles out the lyrics from " Rational Gaze " : " Our light @-@ induced image of truth â filtered blank of its substance / As our eyes won 't adhere to intuitive lines / Everything examined . Separated , one thing at a time / The harder we stare the more complete the disintegration . " Haake explains that Catch Thirtythree 's cover , title and lyrics deal with " the paradoxes / negations / contradictions of life and death ( as we see it in our finest moments of unrestrained metaphoric interpretation ) " . 
 The main theme of obZen is " human evil " , according to Haake . The title is a play on the words " obscene " and " Zen " ; in addition , " ob " means " anti " in Latin . Therefore , the title suggests that the human species has found harmony and balance in warfare and bloodshed . Revolver Magazine finds the lyrics of the title track from obZen representative of the entire album : " Salvation found in vomit and blood / Where <unk> , lies , corruption / War and pain is god . " However , Haake claims , " We don 't dwell on hate and bad feelings as people . But with these songs , I think we really wanted to paint a picture lyrically that might be seen as a cautionary tale . We 're going , ' Heads up . Here 's what some of the parts of being human are about , and this is what we can be at our worst . ' So it 's more about being aware of negative feelings than actually living them all the time . "

 = James Bond filmography = 
 Commander James Bond RN â code number 007 â is a fictional character created by the British journalist and novelist Ian Fleming in 1952 . The character appeared in a series of twelve novels and two short story collections written by Fleming and a number of continuation novels and spin @-@ off works after Fleming 's death in 1964 . Seven actors have played Bond in 26 films . 
 Fleming portrayed Bond as a tall , athletic , handsome secret agent in his thirties or forties ; he has several vices including drinking , smoking , gambling , automobiles and women . He is an exceptional marksman , and skilled in unarmed combat , skiing , swimming and golf . While Bond kills without hesitation or regret , he usually kills only when carrying out orders , while acting in self @-@ defence and occasionally as revenge . 
 American actor Barry Nelson was the first to portray Bond on screen , in a 1954 television adaptation , " Casino Royale " . In 1961 Eon Productions began work on Dr. No , an adaptation of the novel of the same name . The result was a film that began a series of 24 films that celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2012 . After considering the likes of " refined " English actors such as Cary Grant and David Niven , the producers cast Sean Connery as Bond in the film . Fleming was appalled at the selection of the uncouth , 31 @-@ year @-@ old Scottish actor , considering him to be the antithesis of his character . However , Connery 's physical prowess and sexual magnetism in the role came to be closely identified with the character , with Fleming ultimately changing his view on Connery and incorporating aspects of his portrayal into the books . 
 Following Connery 's portrayal , David Niven , George Lazenby , Roger Moore , Timothy Dalton , Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig have assumed the role in twenty @-@ six feature film productions . These screen versions have retained many traits from Fleming 's depiction , although some of Bond 's less fashionable attitudes have been dropped , such as racism , homophobia , retaining the services of a maid , and in the more recent films , smoking . Despite playing the same character , there have been notable differences among the portrayals . Daniel Craig is the incumbent Bond in the long @-@ running Eon series , and played the part for a fourth time in the latest film , Spectre , released in October 2015 . 
 = = Fleming 's literary characterisation = = 
 A Secret Service agent , Bond was a composite based on a number of commandos whom author Ian Fleming had known during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II , to whom he added his own style and a number of his own tastes . Fleming appropriated the name from American ornithologist James Bond . Bond 's code number 007 comes from one of British naval intelligence 's key achievements of World War I : the breaking of the German diplomatic code . One of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram , which was coded 0075 , and which was one of the factors that led the US entering the war . Subsequently if material was graded 00 it meant it was highly classified . Fleming later told a journalist , " When I was at the Admiralty ... all the top @-@ secret signals had the double @-@ 0 prefix ... and I decided to borrow it for Bond " . 
 Although James Bond is in his mid @-@ to @-@ late thirties , he does not age in Fleming 's stories . Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett noted that , " within the first few pages [ of Casino Royale ] Ian had introduced most of Bond 's idiosyncrasies and trademarks " , which included his looks , his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits : Bond 's penchant for alcohol runs throughout the series of books and he smokes up to 70 cigarettes a day . 
 Fleming decided to underplay Bond 's character , observing that " Exotic things would happen to and around him , but he would be a neutral figure " . On another occasion , he reinforced his point , saying , " When I wrote the first one in 1953 , I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull , uninteresting man to whom things happened ; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument " .

 Sean Connery was the first actor to portray Bond on film in Dr. No ( 1962 ) . An amateur bodybuilder , he had come to the attention of the Bond film producers after several appearances in British films from the late 1950s . At a muscular 6 ' 2 " , Fleming originally disapproved of his casting as James Bond , believing him to be an overgrown stuntman who lacked the finesse and elegance to play James Bond ; he envisaged a suave actor , such as David Niven playing the role . Producer Albert R. Broccoli â known to all as Cubby â disagreed with Fleming 's view , later commenting that " I wanted a ballsy guy ... put a bit of veneer over that tough Scottish hide and you 've got Fleming 's Bond instead of all the mincing <unk> we had applying for the job " . Eon 's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal , an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman who said , after appearing with Connery in Goldfinger , " He was exceedingly handsome , virile and sexy and that really was the tenor of what the script was always trying to display " . After Connery was chosen , director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser , and introduced him to the high life , restaurants , casinos and women of London . In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson , Young educated the actor " in the ways of being dapper , witty , and above all , cool " . 
 Connery 's interpretation of the character differed considerably from Fleming 's , being more promiscuous and cold blooded than the literary version . Connery described Bond as " a complete sensualist â senses highly tuned , awake to everything , quite amoral . I particularly like him because he thrives on conflict " . Academic James Chapman observed that for Dr. No , Connery 's interpretation of the character , although not complete , showed the actor " should be credited with having established a new style of performance : a British screen hero in the manner of an American leading man " . In his second film , From Russia with Love , Connery looked less nervous and edgy ; he gave " a relaxed , wry performance of subtle wit and style " . Pfeiffer and Worrall noted that Connery " personified James Bond with such perfection that even Ian Fleming ... admitted that it was difficult imagining anyone else in the part " ; academic Jeremy Black agreed and declared that " Connery made the role his own and created the Bond audience for the cinema " . Black also observed that Connery gave the character a " spare , pared @-@ down character ... [ with ] inner bleakness along with the style " . Connery played Bond with " the right mix of cool charisma , violence and arrogance ... against which all others are judged " . Raymond Benson perceived that Connery " embodies a ruggedness and an intense screen presence this transcends any preconceived notions about the character " . Benson also noted that Bond was witty , but contains " an assured toughness that epitomises the machismo male " . Roger Moore agreed with Black and Benson , commenting that " Sean was Bond . He created Bond . He embodied Bond and because of Sean , Bond became an instantly recognisable character the world over â he was rough , tough , mean and witty ... he was a bloody good 007 " . However , despite his charm and virility , Connery was characteristically laconic in his delivery . Christopher Bray says of him that " in his single @-@ minded , laconic , mocking , self @-@ sufficient vanity , Connery 's Bond was the epitome of sixties consumer culture " . 
 Interviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965 , Connery identified where he had altered the character for the films , saying " I said to the producers that the character had one defect , there was no humor about him ; to get him accepted , they 'd have to let me play him tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek , so people could laugh . They agreed , and there you are : today Bond is accepted to such an extent that even philosophers take the trouble to analyze him , even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him . And even while they 're laughing at him , people take him terribly seriously " . Connery went on to add that " Bond is important : this invincible superman that every man would like to copy , that every woman would like to conquer , this dream we all have of survival . And then one can 't help liking him " . After the pressures of five films in six years , Connery left the role after the 1967 film You Only Live Twice saying , " It became a terrible pressure , like living in a goldfish bowl ... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond . Also I had become completely identified with it , and it became very wearing and very boring " . 
 After a hiatus of one film â On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , in which George Lazenby played Bond â Connery returned to the role for Diamonds Are Forever after David Picker , the head of United Artists , made it clear that Connery was to be enticed back to the role and that money was no object . When approached about resuming the role of Bond , Connery demanded â and received â a fee of Â£ 1 @.@ 25 million ( Â£ 24 million in 2016 pounds ) , 12 @.@ 5 % of the gross profits and , as a further enticement , United Artists offered to back two films of his choice . His performance received mixed reviews , with Raymond Benson considering that Connery " looks weary and bored ... he is overweight , slow @-@ moving , and doesn 't seem to be trying to create a credible character " . Despite that , Benson considers that Connery " still radiates more screen presence than Roger Moore or George Lazenby " . On the other hand , Pauline Kael said " Connery 's James Bond is less lecherous than before and less foppish â and he 's better this way " . 
 In the early 1980s producer Jack Schwartzman moved ahead with a non @-@ Eon Bond film , following the controversy over the 1961 novel Thunderball and the subsequent long legal battle ; the result was Never Say Never Again . Connery accepted an offer to play Bond once more , asking for ( and receiving ) a fee of $ 3 million ( $ 7 million in 2016 dollars ) , a percentage of the profits , as well as casting , director and script approval . The script has several references to Bond 's advancing years â playing on Connery being 52 at the time of filming . David Robinson , reviewing the film for The Times considered that , " Connery ... is back , looking hardly a day older or thicker , and still outclassing every other exponent of the role , in the <unk> throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way " . In 2003 Bond , as portrayed by Connery , was selected as the third @-@ greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute . 
 = = = David Niven : 1967 = = = 
 When Sean Connery had been cast in November 1961 , David Niven had been Fleming 's choice for the role as the actor reflected his image of the character . In 1965 producer Charles Feldman signed Niven to play Sir James Bond for Casino Royale , a film not made by Eon Productions . Connery and Peter Sellers had both turned down the role . Niven was 56 when he played Bond and his characterisation was that of an elderly man who had won the Victoria Cross at the Siege of Mafeking , had a daughter by his lover , the spy Mata Hari , played Claude Debussy on the piano , ate royal jelly and cultivated black roses . The concept of Bond is that once Niven 's Bond retired , his name and 007 designation was passed to another agent to keep the legend alive ; James Chapman notes that the implication was that the " other Bond " was that played by Connery . 
 Chapman considered the concept of an elderly Bond to be an interesting one , with Bond referring to Connery 's Bond as a " sexual acrobat who leaves a trail of beautiful dead women behind like blown roses " . In line with the literary Bond , Niven 's character drives a vintage Bentley , rather than the Aston Martin favoured by Connery . Bond scholar Steven Jay Rubin thought Niven perfectly cast as the retired Bond , and saw him as " a throw @-@ back to the hell @-@ for @-@ leather adventure heroes " of the character , which paralleled Niven 's own life and career . Barnes and Hearn describe this as a " perfectly fair interpretation " , given the way Niven approached the role , while Raymond Benson thinks casting Niven was " intelligent " . Jeremy Black questioned the use of Niven in the role , observing that he did not seem to be a killer , and did not have the " disconcerting edge " that Connery had . 
 = = = George Lazenby : 1969 = = = 
 With the departure of Connery after You Only Live Twice , Broccoli and director Peter R. Hunt chose Australian George Lazenby to play the role of Bond . He first came to their attention after seeing him in a Fry 's Chocolate Cream advertisement . Lazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Savile Row suit ( ordered , but uncollected , by Connery ) , and going to Connery 's barber at the Dorchester Hotel . Lazenby consolidated his claim during a screen test , when he accidentally punched a professional wrestler , who was acting as stunt coordinator , in the face , impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression . Lazenby never signed a contract , with negotiations dragging on during production , and he was subsequently convinced by his agent Ronan O 'Rahilly that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s ; as a result he left the role before the release of On Her Majesty 's Secret Service in 1969 . For his performance as Bond , Lazenby was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year â Actor at the 27th Golden Globe Awards . 
 Critical opinion was split about Lazenby ; he has been considered to have been the worst Bond , and has variously been described as " laconic and humourless " , " a little stiff " and " annoying and smug " . Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby 's performance , saying that he " is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either , there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache " . The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby , saying that " Lazenby , if not a spurious Bond , is merely a casual , pleasant , satisfactory replacement " . Pauline Kael called Lazenby " quite a dull fellow " in her otherwise positive review in The New Yorker . However , Peter R. Hunt , director of On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , stated that Lazenby should have undertaken more films in the role , saying " he would have made a very credible Bond and been very good indeed " . 
 Smith and Lavington consider that Lazenby " had chosen to play Bond the same way as Sean Connery had , with perhaps more humility and humanity " ; they went on to say that " Lazenby 's inexperience rarely shows " in the film , and that " he invariably rises to the occasion " . Alexander Walker in the London Evening Standard said that , " The truth is that George Lazenby is almost as good a James Bond as the man referred to in his film as ' the other fellow ' . Lazenby 's voice is more suave than sexy @-@ sinister and he could pass for the other fellow 's twin on the shady side of the casino . Bond is now definitely all set for the Seventies " . Judith Crist of New York Magazine commented that , " This time around there 's less suavity and a no @-@ nonsense muscularity and maleness to the role via the handsome Mr. Lazenby " . Feminist film critic Molly Haskell wrote an approving review in the Village Voice : " Lazenby ... seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini , more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading ( or playing ) Playboy , and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part @-@ time playmates " . 
 James Chapman considers that Lazenby looks the part of Bond , identifying his athleticism and " arrogant swagger " , which " convey the snobbery of the character " . Chapman also distinguished a more vulnerable and human characterisation in Bond â feeling exhausted and falling in love â as opposed to the " heroic superman " of Connery . Brian Fairbanks noted that " OHMSS gives us a James Bond capable of vulnerability , a man who can show fear and is not immune to heartbreak . Lazenby is that man , and his performance is superb " . Ben Macintyre also observed that of all the Bonds , Lazenby 's characterisation was closest to that of Fleming 's original character . 
 = = = Roger Moore : 1973 â 85 = = = 
 After Diamonds Are Forever , Broccoli and Saltzman tried to convince Sean Connery to return as Bond , but he declined . After considering Jeremy Brett , Michael Billington and Julian Glover , the two producers finally turned to Roger Moore , who they had previously discussed for On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , but who had been unavailable , and he was ultimately cast to play Bond in Live and Let Die . At the time Moore was an established television actor , known for his performances as Simon Templar in The Saint and Lord Brett Sinclair in The <unk> ! : in both of which he played a " charming , debonair , international playboy " . When playing Bond , Moore tried not to imitate either Connery or his previous roles , and screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz fitted the screenplay around Moore 's persona by giving more comedy scenes and a light @-@ hearted feel to Bond , an approach that led Raymond Benson to describe Moore 's Bond as " a rather smarmy , eyebrow @-@ raising international playboy who never seemed to get hurt " . 
 Film writer Andrew Spicer considered Roger Moore to be the most elegant and mannerly of the Bonds , with the voice and style of an English debonair country gentleman . Benson agreed , stating that Moore was , " too nice and well @-@ mannered to be a James Bond of any real substance " , while Doug Pratt said that " the writers worked out an amenable personality for Roger Moore and found a breezy balance between comedy and action " . To make Moore 's character appear tougher , a Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum â which at the time was associated with the macho image of the Clint Eastwood character , Dirty Harry â was chosen for Moore to use in Live and Let Die rather than Bond 's usual choice of Walther PPK . 
 Spicer says " Roger Moore re @-@ created Bond as an old @-@ style debonair hero , more polished and sophisticated than Connery 's incarnation , using the mocking insouciance he had perfected in his role as Simon Templar ... Moore 's humour was a throwaway , and certainly in the later films , verged on self @-@ parody . It was an essential strand in the increasingly tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek direction of the series which became more light @-@ hearted , knowing and playfully intertextual " . Chapman noted that Moore was the most comedic of the Bonds , with a more light @-@ hearted approach to playing the character with a mocking wit and innuendo . Additionally , Moore 's one @-@ liners were delivered in a way to suggest that the violence inherent in the films was a joke , as opposed to Connery 's , which was used to mitigate the violence . Moore explained his approach to the humour by saying " to me , the Bond situations are so ridiculous ... I mean , this man is supposed to be a spy , and yet everybody knows he 's a spy ... it 's outrageous . So you have to treat the humour outrageously as well " . 
 Pauline Kael was a fairly vocal critic of Moore 's , dismissing him as an " iceberg " in The Man with the Golden Gun . In reviewing For Your Eyes Only , she wrote " Roger Moore is Bond again , and his idea of Bond 's imperturbable cool is the same as playing dead " . Reviewing Moonraker , she wrote " Roger Moore is dutiful and passive as Bond ; his clothes are neatly pressed and he shows up for work , like an office manager who is turning into dead wood but hanging on to collect his pension " . Only in The Spy Who Loved Me , one of Kael 's favourite Bond films , did she praise him describing him as self @-@ effacing : " Moore gets the chance to look scared â an emotion that suits him and makes him more likable " . 
 A number of Moore 's personal preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond : his taste for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits were assigned to the character . Moore 's use for cigars in his early films put him in contrast to the cigarette @-@ smoking Connery , Lazenby and Dalton . By the time of Moore 's fifth film , For Your Eyes Only , released in 1981 , his characterisation had come to represent an old @-@ fashioned character , in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s . 
 In 1985 Moore appeared in his seventh and final film , A View to a Kill ; he was 57 ( he appeared alongside co @-@ star Tanya Roberts , who was 30 ) . Critics focussed on Moore 's age : The Washington Post said " Moore isn 't just long in the tooth â he 's got tusks , and what looks like an eye job has given him the pie @-@ eyed <unk> of a zombie . He 's not believable anymore in the action sequences , even less so in the romantic scenes " . When he was cast for the film , Moore recalled that he felt " a bit long in the tooth " , and in December 2007 admitted that he " was only about four hundred years too old for the part " . Like Connery , Moore appeared as Bond in seven films ; by the time he retired in 1985 , he was the oldest actor to play 007 in the Eon series , and his Bond films had earned over $ 1 billion at the box office . 
 = = = Timothy Dalton : 1986 â 94 = = = 
 With the retirement of Roger Moore in 1985 , a search for a new actor to play Bond took place that saw a number of actors , including Sam Neill , Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton audition for the role in 1986 . Bond co @-@ producer Michael G. Wilson , director John Glen , Dana and Barbara Broccoli " were impressed with Sam Neill and very much wanted to use him " , although Bond producer Albert R. Broccoli was not sold on the actor . Dalton and Brosnan were both considered by Eon , but after Brosnan was eventually ruled out by his Remington Steele contract , Dalton was appointed in August 1986 on a salary of $ 5 @.@ 2 million . When he was either 24 or 25 years old Dalton had discussed playing Bond with Broccoli , but decided he was too young to accept the role , thinking Bond should be played between 35 and 40 years old . In preparing for the role , Dalton , a green @-@ eyed , dark haired , slender , 6 ' 2 " ( 1 m 88 cm ) classically trained Shakespearean actor , was keen to portray the character as accurately as possible , reading up extensively on the books before his role in The Living Daylights ( 1987 ) . 
 Dalton 's Bond was a serious one : dark , cold , emotional stern , ruthless , showing little humour , and focused as a killer with little time for fun and indulgence . Dalton 's interpretation of the character came from his " desire to see a darker Bond " , one that was " less of a womaniser , tougher and closer to the darker character Ian Fleming wrote about " . James Chapman also considered Dalton to be closer to Fleming 's Bond than the previous actors , writing that Dalton was " clearly less comfortable ... with the witty asides and one @-@ liners ... so he becomes something closer to the Bond of the books , who rarely develops a sense of humour " . When reviewing Licence to Kill , Iain Johnstone of The Sunday Times disagreed , declaring that " any vestiges of the gentleman spy ... by Ian Fleming " have now gone ; he went on to say that " this character is remarkably close both in deed and action to the eponymous hero of the new Batman film " . 
 Not all viewers were taken with Dalton . Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail was entirely dismissive . " The new Bond has been widely described in feature stories as a throwback to the Ian Fleming original ( studying the Fleming novels , Dalton was pleased to discover that Bond was a human being , he says ) , and that may be true , if the Fleming original lacked charm , sex appeal and wit . Timothy Dalton 's Bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity , and eschews promiscuity â <unk> Harry . You get the feeling that on his off nights , he might curl up with the Reader 's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting â he 'd try to memorize the jokes â before nodding off under the influence of Ovaltine . The British reviews of The Living Daylights have been laudatory , perhaps because this Bond is the most British of all , if British is to be understood as a synonym for reserved " . 
 Raymond Benson noted that Dalton " purposely played Bond as a ruthless and serious man with very little of the wit displayed by Connery , Lazenby or Moore " , and considered him to be " the most accurate and literal interpretation of the role ... ever seen on screen " . His character also reflected a degree of moral ambiguity ; in Licence to Kill , for instance , he becomes a rogue agent , while Dalton himself saw the character as a " man , not a superhuman ; a man who is beset with moral confusions and <unk> and uncertainties , and who is often very frightened and nervous and tense " . Smith and Lavington observed that during Dalton 's portrayal in Licence to Kill , Bond appeared " self @-@ absorbed ... reckless , brutal , prone to nervous laughter and ... probably insane , or at least seriously disturbed . In the light of Licence to Kill , one academic , Martin Willis , referred to Dalton 's Bond as a " muscular vigilante " . Steven Jay Rubin noted that Dalton 's films had " a hard @-@ edged reality and some unflinching violent episodes that were better suited to Dalton 's more realistic approach to the character " . Rubin considered Dalton 's portrayal to be " Fleming 's Bond ... the suffering Bond " . In contrast to the previous incarnations of the character , Smith and Lavington identified Dalton 's humour as " brooding rather than flippant " ; combined with his heavy smoking , they considered him " an effective leading man " . Eoghan Lyng , writing for The James Bond Dossier , favourably compared him to Daniel Craig , stating that " Despite chronological placement , it was Dalton , not Brosnan , who proved to be the prototype for the 21st century Bond . " . Although Bond screenwriter Richard Maibaum called Sean Connery the best Bond , he considered Dalton the best actor of the four he worked with . His predecessor , Roger Moore also felt that Dalton was the best Bond . 
 Dalton 's films did not perform as well at the box office as most of the previous films . Commentators such as Screen International considered the Bond series had run its course in the age of series such as Indiana Jones and Lethal Weapon . Edward P. Comentale observed that " Dalton , for all his occasional flat northern vowels , was probably too much the stage actor to be convincing as an action hero in the age of Willis , Schwarzenegger and Stallone " . After just two films â The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill â litigation ensued over the licensing of the Bond catalogue , delaying what would have been Dalton 's third film by several years . His six @-@ year contract expired in 1993 and he left the series in 1994 . 
 = = = Pierce Brosnan : 1995 â 2004 = = = 
 After Timothy Dalton retired from the Bond role in 1994 , Eon turned to the actor they had considered after A View to a Kill : Pierce Brosnan . He was offered a three @-@ film contract , with an option on a fourth ; his salary for his first film , GoldenEye , was $ 4 million , which rose to $ 16 @.@ 5 million for his fourth and final outing , Die Another Day . Brosnan had first met Broccoli on the set of For Your Eyes Only , when Brosnan 's wife , Cassandra Harris , was appearing in the film as Countess Lisl von Schlaf , and the couple lunched with Broccoli during filming . Brosnan went on to play a criminal @-@ turned @-@ private investigator in Remington Steele in the 1980s , where he captured some of the traits of previous Bonds in playing the role : like Moore , he exemplified a high degree of suavity , elegance , charm and wit , but displayed a masculinity and grittiness on occasion reminiscent of Connery 's Bond , both successfully " combine the character 's Englishness with a classless internationalism that is highly knowing " . Andrew Spicer says that " Brosnan 's frame carries the ' Armani look ' with its refined understated Englishness , to perfection . His lithe , sinuous athleticism is well suited to the fast @-@ paced action and state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art gadgetry that retains the series ' core appeal " . James Chapman also considered Brosnan 's appearance striking , saying the actor had " old @-@ fashioned , darkly handsome matinee idol looks " . 
 With Brosnan , the Bond writers knew that because of the changes in public attitudes , he could not be as overtly sexual and dominant over women as Connery 's Bond , and was denounced by M in Goldeneye to be a " sexist , misogynist dinosaur , a relic of the Cold War " . Brosnan was seen by many as the quintessential James Bond in appearance and manner ; displaying an air of coolness , elegance and a grace which made him believable as an international playboy , if not purely as an assassin . John G. Stackhouse for instance argues that it is preposterous that any man as strikingly handsome as Brosnan and Connery could be a secret agent , saying , " When Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan enters a room , everyone notices . Thus it is ridiculous to suppose that James Bond , looking like that , could be a secret agent for longer than about two seconds " . 
 Brosnan 's Bond was introduced in Goldeneye ; James Chapman argues that the film works his portrayal of Bond into the history of the others in the series through the post @-@ credits sequence use of the Aston Martin DB5 , previously seen in Goldfinger and Thunderball , " thus immediately evoking the memory of [ Sean ] Connery " . Brosnan 's characterisation of Bond was seen by Jeremy Black as being " closer to the Fleming novels than Moore ... yet he is also lighter and less intense than Dalton " . Black also commented that the shift in character in the first three films reflected changing social opinions , with Bond not smoking . Brosnan was clear he wanted to change Bond 's smoking habit , saying " I don 't give a damn about everyone 's perception of the character : I think smoking causes cancer therefore he doesn 't smoke " , although he did smoke a Cuban cigar in Die Another Day . Brosnan continued with the use of humour prevalent with other portrayals , and provided a " mix of action and danger threaded through with the right amount of wit and humour " ; Smith and Lavington saw the humour largely as puns that were " flippant , but not crass " . 
 After four films in the role , Brosnan stated he wished to do one final Bond film . Although plans were made for a film to be released in 2004 , negotiations stalled and Brosnan announced his intention to leave in July 2004 . 
 = = = Daniel Craig : 2005 â present = = = 
 On 14 October 2005 Eon Productions , Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM announced at a press conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series ( although seventh film Bond overall ) . A tuxedo @-@ clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat . Craig had based his acceptance of the role on the strength of the script for the first film , Casino Royale ; he later recalled that " once I sat down and read the story , I just thought that I wanted to tell [ it ] ... I 'm a big Bond fan , and I love what he represents " . Significant controversy followed the decision , with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice . Throughout the entire production period , Internet campaigns such as <unk> expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest . Craig , unlike previous actors , was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall , dark , handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed . Many disparagingly called him " James Blonde " , believing the 5 ft 10 in ( 1 @.@ 78 m ) blond @-@ haired blue @-@ eyed rugged Craig to be far fitting from the traditional tall , dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him . The Daily Mirror ran a front page news story critical of Craig , with the headline , The Name 's Bland â James Bland . 
 Craig first played Bond in the 2006 film Casino Royale , an adaptation of Fleming 's novel of the same name and a reboot of the Eon series , which saw Bond earn his 00 status . Despite the negative press on his appointment , Craig was widely praised by critics and former Bonds after the release of Casino Royale , believing him to have been the first actor to truly nail Fleming 's character in the book : Todd McCarthy , reviewing the film for Variety , considered that " Craig comes closer to the author 's original conception of this exceptionally long @-@ lived male fantasy figure than anyone since early Sean Connery " , and he went on to say that " Craig once and for all claims the character as his own " , while Steven Spielberg called Craig " the perfect 21st @-@ century Bond " . Paul Arendt , writing for the BBC , agreed , observing that " Daniel Craig is not a good Bond . He 's a great Bond . Specifically , he is 007 as conceived by Ian Fleming â a professional killing machine , a charming , cold @-@ hearted patriot with a taste for luxury . Craig is the first actor to really nail 007 's defining characteristic : he 's an absolute swine " . James Chapman commented on the realism and violence in the film noting that Bond is seen to seriously bleed for the first time in the series ; Chapman also identified a number of violent scenes which make Casino Royale notable in the series . In 2012 Skyfall was released : it was Craig 's third outing as 007 . Reviewing the film , Philip French , writing in The Observer , considered that Craig managed to " get out of the shadow of Connery " , while the New Statesman thought that he had " relaxed into Bond without losing any steeliness " . 
 = D.S. ( song ) = 
 " D.S. " is an album track by Michael Jackson from his 1995 double disc record HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I. It is track six on the second disc , one of the three songs from that disc whose lyrics are printed in the album booklet , and is four minutes and forty @-@ nine seconds in length . The song is often cited as a derogatory reference to Santa Barbara County District Attorney Tom Sneddon , whose name is similar to the subject of the song , Dom Sheldon . When Jackson was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993 , the investigation was controlled by Sneddon , who also ordered that Jackson be strip searched . The criminal investigation was subsequently closed when according to the New York Times , " the boy and his family announced that they would no longer cooperate . In an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement of a civil suit filed by the family , the boy was to receive a payment of more than $ 10 million , according to Mr. Jackson â s associates . " Jackson was angered by the allegations , his perception of being mistreated by the police and media , and the negative effect on his health . 
 Shortly afterwards , he began work on HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I. The track " D.S. " is written , composed and produced by Jackson and includes a guitar solo by Slash . It is a rock song that conveys themes such as bitterness , mistrust and corruption within law enforcement . There was no major critical analysis of the song from mainstream reviews when HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I was issued , but the song 's connection to Tom Sneddon was widely reported in the media . Jackson was subsequently involved in projects that made coded references to Sneddon and the 1993 investigation . 
 = = Background = = 
 HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I , its album tracks such as " D.S. " and corresponding music videos are heavily influenced by the 1993 child sexual abuse accusations made against Jackson , the reaction to the allegations and the effect they had on the singer . The album acts as Jackson 's response to the media and the public . In 1993 , Evan Chandler and his son Jordan Chandler accused Jackson of child sexual abuse . Jackson agreed to a strip search of his body at Neverland Ranch ; the strip search was ordered by Thomas W. Sneddon Jr . , the district attorney of Santa Barbara County , California . Sneddon was in charge of the investigation as a whole . The accuser gave a detailed description of what he alleges were Jackson 's genitals , also giving details on patches of vitiligo on the singer 's body , but eventually the description was proved wrong . In an emotional state , Jackson stood on a platform in the middle of the room , took off all his clothes and was examined for approximately twenty @-@ five minutes ; he was never physically touched . 
 The media coverage of the allegations was criticized for using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline , for accepting stories of Jackson 's alleged criminal activity in return for money , for accepting confidential leaked material from the police investigation in return for money , for deliberately using pictures of Jackson 's appearance at its worst , for a lack of objectivity and for using headlines that strongly implied Jackson 's guilt . At the time , Jackson said of the media reaction , " I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible , terrible mass media . At every opportunity , the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions " . 
 A few months after the allegations became news , Jackson had lost approximately 10 pounds in weight and had stopped eating . Jackson 's health had deteriorated to the extent that he cancelled the remainder of his tour and went into rehabilitation . Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of the clinic , and was put on Valium IV to wean him from painkillers . The singer 's spokesperson told reporters that Jackson was " barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level " . While in the clinic , Jackson took part in group and one @-@ on @-@ one therapy sessions . 
 Jackson was not charged with a crime and the police closed their criminal investigation citing lack of evidence . With his health improving , Jackson then began work on a new album called HIStory , and commenced recording in 1994 . The song " D.S. " included in the album contains lyrics about a cold man called Dom S. Sheldon , which , when sung , sounds similar to Thomas Sneddon . Some media sources , and Sneddon himself , believe the song is directed at him . 
 = = Themes and genre = = 
 " D.S. " has very similar themes to the rest of HIStory . The album 's content focuses on the hardships and public struggles Jackson went through just prior to its production . In the new jack swing / funk rock efforts " Scream " and " Tabloid Junkie " , along with the R & B ballad " You Are Not Alone " , Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels , and directs much of his anger at the media . " D.S. " contains an excerpt from the Yes hit single " Owner of a Lonely Heart " composed by Trevor Rabin , Jon Anderson , Chris Squire and Trevor Horn . The lyrics describe the subject of the song as a man who wants him " dead or alive " and " really tried to take me down / By surprise " . The track ends with the sound of a gunshot . 
 The song has a distinct rock feel to it , with a guitar solo performed by Guns N ' Roses guitarist Slash , who had previously worked with Jackson on his Dangerous album . Jackson screams the name " Slash ! " immediately before Slash 's part in the song . Jackson has previously made a number of successful rock songs , including ; " Beat It " , " Dirty Diana " , " Give In to Me " and " Scream " . In his HIStory album review , Entertainment Weekly 's David Browne musically defines " D.S. " as a hard rock song .

 Although the album HIStory was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and had additional related Grammy nominations , hardly any mainstream music reviewers provided a critical analysis of " D.S. " in their reviews of the album . Analysis of the song usually only covered the connection to Tom Sneddon and the song 's genre . However , Fred Shuster of the Daily News of Los Angeles described " D.S. " as a " superb [ slice ] of organic funk that will fuel many of the summer 's busiest dance floors " . 
 Many news organizations reviewed the piece in connection to Sneddon . Fox News Channel and CNN expressed the opinion that the " cold man " of this song 's lyrics is Sneddon , as when sung , " Dom S. Sheldon " sounds very close to " Thomas Sneddon " . The BBC suggested that the lyric 's reference to a " <unk> " sounds similar to " <unk> " , meaning " Santa Barbara District Attorney " . The Guardian and The New York Times expressed the view that Jackson suggests " Sheldon " has links to the CIA and the Ku Klux Klan and he just " wants your vote " . Sneddon 's own work website indicates that he believes he is the subject of the song , stating , " He 's the only DA in the nation to have an angry song written about him by pop megastar Michael Jackson " . Of the song , he said , " I have not â shall we say â done him the honor of listening to it , but I â ve been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot " .

 Although there was no music video made for " D.S. " , the song 's subject was referenced in the short film Ghosts . Released in 1997 and premiering at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival , it was written by Jackson and Stephen King and directed by Stan Winston . The story was loosely based on the events and isolation Jackson felt after he was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993 . In the plot , the Maestro ( played by Jackson ) is nearly chased out of his town by the mayor ( who deliberately looks very similar to Sneddon ) and the residents because they believe him to be a " freak " . It features many special effects and dance moves to original music , composed and choreographed by Jackson . The film includes several songs and music videos from the albums HIStory and Blood on the Dance Floor : HIStory in the Mix . The video for Ghosts is over thirty @-@ eight minutes long and holds the Guinness World Record as the world 's longest music video . 
 The child sexual abuse allegations of 2003 resulted in a long trial two years later . Sneddon was the lead investigator again , as well as the trial prosecutor . The trial ended with Jackson being acquitted on all counts . The two investigations being controlled by Sneddon have led to complaints that he was motivated by a " vendetta " against Jackson . Evidence to support these claims include Sneddon joking about Jackson 's greatest hits album being released on the same day as his arrest and sarcastically saying , " Like the sheriff and I really are into that kind of music " . He then preceded to call Jackson " Wacko Jacko " and shouting " we got him , we finally got him " to the media when he had only just begun an investigation and had gathered limited information or evidence . " D.S. " was sung outside the courtroom by a group of Jackson 's fans every day the trial took place .

Michael welcomes Holly back , but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. ( Rob Huebel ) are still in a relationship . Holly then tells the women of the office that she 's giving A.J. an ultimatum : either propose to her by year 's end or their relationship is over . Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he 's seeing a woman named Tara from New York , and Holly shows curiosity , but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy . When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly 's relationship with A.J. , he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story â a present from A.J. â throws it in the trash , and pours his coffee on it . When Holly demands to know who did it , Michael comes forward and admits that he is upset and still has feelings for her . A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly , and Michael welcomes him politely . After cleaning Holly 's Woody , he leaves the office and Pam follows him out , where he breaks down . In order to lift his spirits , Pam tells him about Holly 's ultimatum , suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long . He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody , with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael 's actions .

 The episode was written by co @-@ executive producer Mindy Kaling , her eighteenth writing credit for the series . Rainn Wilson , who portrays Dwight Schrute on the series , directed the episode , his second directing credit of the series after the sixth @-@ season episode " The Cover @-@ Up " . The episode was also the first of several season seven episodes that saw the return of Amy Ryan as Holly . Kaling purposely made Dwight " complicated " and " mean " in the script ; she wanted to avoid a situation wherein Jim and Dwight become best friends , calling it something that would happen in a " crappy sitcom feel @-@ good formula . " She wanted to stress the fact that " Jim [ and Dwight ] are not friends . " Kaling specifically wrote Jim to be " off @-@ guard [ and ] surprised " in the episode , because she reasoned that " perfect isn 't always nearly as fun to play or watch as flawed . " The episode was filmed in early November and was shot out of order . This required the assistant directors of The Office to re @-@ dress " the sets from white , spare ' classy Christmas ' look to the elaborate , colorful ' regular Christmas look . ' " 
 According to Kaling , the group had to pretend like it was cold during the outdoor scenes when it was actually warm . The snow that was used for the snowballs was artificial , and did not cooperate well . According to Kaling , the snowballs would " ' explode ' before they made contact " . While Krasinski and Wilson did not hold back during the fights , neither one was injured ; the blood on Jim 's face and shirt was artificial . The snowmen featured at the end of the episode took a day to construct . In addition , the artificial snow had to be maintained , and footprints had to " be tracked constantly " to maintain continuity . The snowmen were crafted out of 100 tons of chipped ice , and the show 's special effects team created molds and hand @-@ crafted the creations . The scenes featuring the snowmen were shot on the hottest day of the episode 's shoot in Los Angeles , with temperatures reaching above 90 degrees Fahrenheit . The entire crew was outfitted UV @-@ <unk> glasses because " snow @-@ blindness was a real possibility . " To prevent heat @-@ related injuries , an on @-@ set medic monitored the staff and crew ; anyone who was slated to appear outside was " slathered in sunscreen " and kept inside until " moments " before each shot . 
 The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include more scenes of Kelly giving out the Sabre gifts , extended scenes of Toby discussing the Scranton Strangler trial , Jim asking Erin for the first aid kit , and Pam talking about Holly 's ultimatum .

A line that was cut from the scene features Darryl harshly criticizing the Disney Channel series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody . The gifts that Kelly decides to give to her staff members on Corporate 's behalf are laptop sleeves , featuring the popular fictional character Hello Kitty , which is produced by the Japanese company Sanrio . Holly 's gift from A.J. is a replica of Woody from Toy Story , the 1995 animated Pixar film about friendly toys coming to life when no one is around . When Michael claims he heard Holly would be single , he blames " Nora Ephron and every romantic comedy ever " . Andy disguises himself as the Grinch and steals the Christmas tree 's star for the sake of Jada 's entertainment .

" He also said that " it was an initially good payment " . TV Fanatic 's Dan Forcella said that " Classy Christmas " was an enjoyable episode and " watching Jim suffer as Dwight jumped out of a snowman and pummeled him with snow ball after snow ball was absolutely hilarious .

 Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode " another standout holiday episode " , and applauded the return of Holly , calling her " welcome " .

He compared the episode the third season episode " A Benihana Christmas " , writing that " both deal with Michael â s heart being broken and the somewhat self @-@ destructive ways he deals with it . " However , he felt that the episode " struggles greatly if you have no emotional connection to Holly and Michael " because it " isn 't funny , by any real stretch of the term , nor is it really intended to be funny . " He went on to say " I like episodes like this one in general and don 't necessarily need the show to make me laugh , but I would say that I wanted this hour to be slightly more ... pleasant . "

 Fox was born on June 9 , 1961 , in Edmonton , Alberta , Canada , to Phyllis ( nÃ©e Piper ) , an actress / payroll clerk , and William Fox , a police officer and Canadian Forces member . 
 Fox 's family lived in various cities and towns across Canada because of his father 's career . The family finally moved to the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby , British Columbia , when his father retired in 1971 . His father died on January 6 , 1990 , from a heart attack . Fox attended Burnaby Central Secondary School , and now has a theatre named for him in Burnaby South Secondary . Fox , at age 15 , starred in the Canadian television series Leo and Me produced by the CBC , and in 1979 , at age 18 , he moved to Los Angeles to further his acting career . Shortly after his marriage , he decided to move back to Vancouver . Fox is one of four members of the Leo and Me cast and crew who eventually developed Parkinson 's disease in mid @-@ life , an unusually high number that led to some investigation as to whether an environmental factor may have played a role . 
 Fox was discovered by producer Ronald <unk> and made his American television debut in the television film Letters from Frank , credited under the name " Michael Fox " . He intended to continue to use the name , but when he registered with the Screen Actors Guild , which requires unique registration names to avoid credit ambiguities , he discovered that Michael Fox , a veteran character actor , was already registered under the name . As he explained in his autobiography , Lucky Man : A Memoir and in interviews , he needed to come up with a different name . He did not like the sound of " Michael A. Fox " during a time when " fox " was coming to mean " attractive " and because his middle initial sounded too much like the Canadian " eh ? " He also didn 't like the sound of " Andrew " or " Andy , " so he decided to adopt a new middle initial and settled on " J " , as an homage to actor Michael J. Pollard .

 Fox 's first feature film roles were Midnight Madness ( 1980 ) and Class of 1984 ( 1982 ) , credited in both as Michael Fox . Shortly afterward , he began playing " Young Republican " Alex P. Keaton in the show Family Ties which aired on NBC for seven seasons , 1982 â 89 . In an interview with Jimmy Fallon in April 2014 , Fox stated he negotiated the role at a payphone at Pioneer Chicken . He received the role only after Matthew Broderick was unavailable . Family Ties had been sold to the television network using the pitch " Hip parents , square kids , " with the parents originally intended to be the main characters . However , the positive reaction to Fox 's performance led to his character becoming the focus of the show following the fourth episode . At its peak , the audience for Family Ties drew one @-@ third of America 's households every week . Fox won three Emmy awards for Family Ties , in 1986 , 1987 and 1988 . He also won a Golden Globe Award in 1989 . 
 Brandon Tartikoff , one of the show 's producers , felt that Fox was too short in relation to the actors playing his parents , and tried to have him replaced . Tartikoff reportedly said that " this is not the kind of face you 'll ever find on a lunch @-@ box . " After his later successes , Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom @-@ made lunch @-@ box with the inscription " To Brandon , this is for you to put your crow in . Love and Kisses , Michael J. Fox . " Tartikoff kept the lunch @-@ box in his office for the rest of his NBC career . 
 While filming Family Ties , Fox met his wife , Tracy Pollan , who portrayed his girlfriend , Ellen . When Fox left the TV series Spin City , his final episodes made numerous allusions to Family Ties : Michael Gross ( who played Alex 's father Steven ) portrays Mike Flaherty 's ( Fox 's ) therapist , and there is a reference to an off @-@ screen character named " Mallory " . Also , when Flaherty becomes an environmental lobbyist in Washington , D.C. , he meets a conservative senator from Ohio named Alex P. Keaton , and in one episode Meredith Baxter played Mike 's mother . 
 As a consequence of working in Family Ties , as well as his acting in Teen Wolf and Back to the Future , Fox became a teen idol , VH1 's show The Greatest later naming him among their " 50 Greatest Teen Idols . "

 In January 1985 Fox was cast to replace Eric Stoltz as Marty McFly , a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time from 1985 to 1955 in Back to the Future . Robert Zemeckis , the director , originally wanted Fox to play Marty , but Gary David Goldberg the creator of Family Ties , which Fox was working on at the time , refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as Meredith Baxter was on maternity leave at the time , Fox 's character Alex Keaton was needed to carry the show in her absence . Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming Back to the Future , but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved . Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox whose schedule was now more open with the return of Meredith Baxter . He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in Once Bitten , but it eventually went to Jim Carrey . During filming , Fox would rehearse for Family Ties from 10 a.m to 6 p.m , then rush to the Back to the Future set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2 : 30 a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months . Back to the Future was both a commercial and critical success . The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number @-@ one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $ 381 @.@ 11 million . Variety applauded the performances , stating that Fox and his co @-@ star Christopher Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown 's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin . The film was later followed by two similarly @-@ successful sequels , Back to the Future Part II ( 1989 ) and Back to the Future Part III ( 1990 ) . 
 During and immediately after the Back to the Future trilogy , Fox starred in Teen Wolf ( 1985 ) , Light of Day ( 1987 ) , The Secret of My Success ( 1987 ) , Bright Lights , Big City ( 1988 ) and Casualties of War ( 1989 ) . 
 In The Secret of My Success , Fox played a recent graduate from Kansas State University who moves to New York City where he has to deal with the ups and downs of the business world . The film was successful at the box office , taking $ 110 million worldwide . Roger Ebert in The Chicago Sun Times wrote ; " Fox provides a fairly desperate center for the film . It could not have been much fun for him to follow the movie 's arbitrary shifts of mood , from sitcom to slapstick , from sex farce to boardroom brawls . " 
 In Bright Lights , Big City , Fox played a fact @-@ checker for a New York magazine , who spends his nights partying with alcohol and drugs . The film received mixed reviews , with Hal Hinson in The Washington Post criticizing Fox by claiming that " he was the wrong actor for the job " . Meanwhile , Roger Ebert praised the actor 's performance : " Fox is very good in the central role ( he has a long drunken monologue that is the best thing he has ever done in a movie ) " . During the shooting of Bright Lights , Big City , Fox co @-@ starred again with Tracy Pollan , his on @-@ screen girlfriend from Family Ties . 
 Fox then starred in Casualties of War , a dark and violent war drama about the Vietnam War , alongside Sean Penn . Casualties of War was not a major box office hit , but Fox , playing a private serving in Vietnam , received good reviews for his performance . Don Willmott on film critic 's website wrote ; " Fox , only one year beyond his Family Ties sitcom silliness , rises to the challenges of acting as the film 's moral voice and sharing scenes with the always intimidating Penn . " 
 In 1991 , he starred in Doc Hollywood , a romantic comedy about a talented medical doctor who decides to become a plastic surgeon . While moving from Washington , D.C. to Los Angeles , he winds up as a doctor in a small southern town in South Carolina . Michael Caton @-@ Jones , from Time Out , described Fox in the film as " at his frenetic best " . The Hard Way was also released in 1991 , with Fox playing an undercover actor learning from police officer James Woods . Between 1992 and 1996 , he continued making several films , such as For Love or Money ( 1993 ) , Life With Mikey ( 1993 ) and Greedy ( 1994 ) . Fox then played small supporting roles in political drama The American President ( 1995 ) and comedy Mars Attacks ! ( 1996 ) . 
 His last major film role was in The Frighteners ( 1996 ) , directed by Peter Jackson . The Frighteners tells the story of Frank Bannister ( Fox ) , an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see , hear , and communicate with ghosts . After losing his wife , he uses his new abilities by cheating customers out of money for his " ghost hunting " business . However , a mass murderer comes back from Hell , prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence . Fox 's performance received critical praise , Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times wrote ; " The film 's actors are equally pleasing . Both Fox , in his most successful starring role in some time , and [ Trini ] Alvarado , who looks rather like Andie MacDowell here , have no difficulty getting into the manic spirit of things . " 
 He voiced the American Bulldog Chance in Disney 's live @-@ action film Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey and its sequel Homeward Bound II : Lost in San Francisco , the titular character in Stuart Little and its two sequels Stuart Little 2 and Stuart Little 3 : Call of the Wild , and Milo Thatch in Disney 's animated film Atlantis : The Lost Empire .
