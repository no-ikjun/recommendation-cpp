 Slovenia on the other hand reacted positively to the offer ; in 2011 Zeta was loaded on a truck and transported by road through Serbia and Hungary . Although longer and thus more expensive , sea routes and roads that included crossing the Croatian border were avoided in fear of Croatian authorities confiscating the submarine . P @-@ 913 was restored with the help of the " Slovenian <unk> Society " and the Slovenian Army , being officially opened on 17 September 2011 at the Pivka Military History Park . 
 In 2013 , Una and a <unk> @-@ class attack submarine , <unk> ( P @-@ 821 ) , were restored and opened to the public in the museum section of the Porto Montenegro marina . The project was initiated by the " Submariner " Society from Tivat and was , after approval by the Montenegro MoD , financed by Porto Montenegro . The donation of one of the submarines to Serbia was initiated by the " Submariner " society from Belgrade in 2009 . However it wasn 't until five years later in June 2014 that the Government of Montenegro officially accepted the proposal and agreed to cede Tisa ( P @-@ 911 ) to Serbia . The submarine will be exhibited at the Museum of Science and Technology in Belgrade . 
 = Stuart Clarence Graham = 
 Major General Stuart Clarence Graham AO , DSO , OBE , MC ( 23 October 1920 – 20 July 1996 ) was a senior officer in the Australian Army , seeing service during the Second World War , the Occupation of Japan and the Vietnam War . Born in 1920 , he graduated from the Royal Military College , Duntroon in 1940 . Graham subsequently held a series of regimental and staff appointments , serving in a number of infantry and armoured units during the Second World War . In the post @-@ war period he served in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan , and held a number of staff and command positions in the Armoured Corps . In the late 1950s he was posted to Army Headquarters , and later served as Director of Military Intelligence . Commanding the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 ATF ) during fighting in South Vietnam during 1967 , he was responsible for establishing the controversial barrier minefield from Dat Do to the coast . Later , Graham filled a range of senior command , staff and diplomatic roles in Australia and overseas , including the position of Deputy Chief of the General Staff ( DCGS ) , before retiring in 1977 . He died in 1996 .

 Graham was born in <unk> , New South Wales , on 23 October 1920 , and was educated at Grafton High School . Highly intelligent , he did well at school and achieved a high position in the Leaving Certificate . After joining the Australian Army in January 1938 , at the age of 19 he graduated from the Royal Military College , Duntroon ( RMC ) in August 1940 , following the outbreak of the Second World War . He was subsequently allocated to the Armoured Corps as a regular officer in the Permanent Military Force ( PMF ) with the rank of lieutenant . At Duntroon Graham had excelled academically and was known for his unorthodox and innovative tactical solutions to military problems . Top of his graduating class , he received the Kings Medal for his achievements . Shortly after his commissioning he married Joyce Lawrence of Canberra on 20 August 1940 , and the couple later had two sons — Stuart born in 1941 , and Ray born in 1944 .

 Graham subsequently held a series of regimental and staff appointments , serving in a number of infantry and armoured units . Volunteering for overseas service , he transferred to the Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) on 26 July 1941 . He was subsequently posted to the 2 / 11th Armoured Car Regiment as the adjutant , followed by attendance at the Staff School . Promoted to captain in September 1942 , Graham briefly served on the headquarters of the 1st Armoured Division before being attached to the British Army . Serving with the British 7th Armoured Division , he saw action with them in the North Africa and Italy 1943 – 44 . Coming ashore on the first day of the Allied landing at Salerno , he was wounded but remained on duty . During this period he gained valuable operational experience in armoured warfare ; while his service in North Africa may also have shaped his thinking about the use of tactical minefields which had been used extensively during the mobile infantry and armoured battles of 1941 – 42 . 
 After returning to Australia in February 1944 , following a short period in staff positions Graham spent the remainder of the war in the South @-@ West Pacific . <unk> to the infantry , in December 1944 he was given command of a company from the 24th Battalion and went on to distinguish himself during the Bougainville campaign in 1945 . During an action on the morning of 17 April C Company , under Graham 's command , encountered heavy resistance in thick jungle while attacking strong Japanese positions around Andersons Junction , astride Dawe Creek . Personally leading the attack , he placed a number of anti @-@ tank guns to cover a river crossing and following heavy fighting the Australians finally secured a foothold by late in the afternoon which allowed a bridge to be erected across the creek for the tanks to move forward in support . After repelling a Japanese counter @-@ attack overnight , the following morning Graham led his company forward and succeeded in seizing the high ground after another day of bitter fighting that resulted in heavy Japanese casualties . He was immediately awarded the Military Cross ( MC ) for his leadership . Graham was later wounded amid heavy fighting in difficult terrain as the Australian advance continued along the Buin Road in May . Promoted temporary major in October 1945 , he finished the war posted to the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment .

 Following the war , Graham served in various staff positions in Eastern Command based in New South Wales , and in 1946 he was posted to Japan on the Headquarters of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force . Promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Interim Army , he later briefly commanded the 2nd Battalion , Australian Regiment ( 2 AR ) between 23 November 1948 and 10 January 1949 . In 1949 Graham was again attached to Headquarters Eastern Command , before subsequently being posted as a tactics instructor to RMC during 1950 – 51 . He later completed further training in the United Kingdom and Germany in 1952 . Considered one of Australia 's foremost tank experts , Graham commanded the 1st Armoured Regiment during 1952 – 53 . He subsequently served as commandant of the Armoured School between 1953 and 1956 , and filled the position of Director of Armour during the same period . He later wrote an influential paper on the successful use of armour in jungle warfare and its ability to reduce casualties among the infantry . Graham attended the United States Armed Forces Staff College and subsequently filled the role of Assistant Military Attaché in Washington , D.C. as an intelligence officer in 1957 – 58 . His exposure to US military culture and intelligence during this period affected his own military thinking and would be influential during his later service . Graham was subsequently posted to Army Headquarters in Canberra in the Directorate of Military Operations and Plans in 1959 . 
 After being promoted to colonel , he served as Director of Military Intelligence between 1960 and 1964 , and while the Australian Army was developing its own doctrine on counter @-@ revolutionary warfare , Graham 's ideas on counter @-@ insurgency were influenced by a visit to South Vietnam in November 1961 . Graham 's understanding of the challenges of the prevailing Cold War environment allowed him to reform Australia 's nascent military intelligence apparatus , encouraging developments in joint intelligence arrangements with Australia 's allies and fostering liaison with his British and US counterparts , as well as establishing relationships with countries in South @-@ East Asia . In recognition of his service to the Australian Staff Corps he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) in 1963 . He then took up an appointment as commandant of the Jungle Training Centre ( JTC ) at Canungra , Queensland in 1964 . The Australian Army Training Team Vietnam ( AATTV ) was being prepared for deployment during this time , and Army officers were learning new tactics , techniques and procedures . Promoted to brigadier in 1965 he then commanded the 6th Task Force in southern Queensland , supervising the training of 2 RAR and 6 RAR , both battalions which would later serve under his command in Vietnam . In 1966 , Graham studied at the Imperial Defence College in London . 
 = = = Vietnam War = = = 
 On 1 January 1967 Graham was appointed Commander 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 ATF ) which was based in Phuoc Tuy Province , South Vietnam , taking over from Brigadier David Jackson . According to Ian McNeill and Ashley Ekins , the official historians of Australian involvement in the Vietnam War , Graham quickly established himself , and developed a sound operational concept , yet the Viet Cong succeeded in preventing him from implementing it as he had intended . With just two battalions 1 ATF 's ability to generate combat power was severely limited , while its location at Nui Dat isolated it from the main population centres and increased the burden of self @-@ protection . During February 1967 1 ATF had sustained its heaviest casualties in the war to that point , losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week , the majority during Operation Bribie after 6 RAR had clashed with two companies from the Viet Cong D445 Battalion reinforced by North Vietnamese regulars , north @-@ west of Hoi My on 17 February . To Graham such losses underscored the need for a third infantry battalion and tanks , yet with the Australian government unable to provide additional military resources at that time , they confirmed in his mind the need to establish a physical barrier to deny the Viet Cong freedom of movement . Graham subsequently established an 11 @-@ kilometre ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) long barrier minefield from Dat Do to the coast during Operation Leeton ( 6 March – 1 June ) in an attempt to regain the initiative . 
 While largely forced on Graham by the inadequate forces available and the inherent contradictions of Australian strategic policy , his decision was contrary to the advice of the senior task force engineer , Major Brian Florence . A number of senior infantry officers had also resisted the idea , including one of Graham 's battalion commanders , Lieutenant Colonel John Warr , commanding officer 5 RAR , who had served in the Korean War where the Australians had suffered a large number of casualties from mines originally laid by other UN forces . Yet unlike many of his colleagues , as an Armoured Corps officer Graham had not served in Korea , and many of the assumptions he developed about mine warfare in North Africa had remained unchallenged . For the first six months the barrier minefield had resulted in a dramatic decline in Viet Cong infiltration , reducing re @-@ supply movement by up to 80 percent . However , recognising the threat the obstacle posed to them , the Viet Cong had immediately begun attempting to penetrate it , cutting gaps in the fence and clearing lanes through the minefield to restore the flow of supplies , as well as lifting mines for their own use . Conceived to hinder the movement of the Viet Cong between their jungle bases and the villages on which they relied for supplies , the failure of South Vietnamese forces to protect the barrier minefield ultimately allowed the Viet Cong to remove thousands of mines , many of which were subsequently used against 1 ATF . While in keeping with the orthodoxy of Australian counter @-@ insurgency doctrine , Graham 's strategy ultimately proved both controversial and costly , and despite initial success , the minefield became a source of munitions for the Viet Cong and later the decision was made to remove it amid growing casualties . 
 Yet such flaws were not immediately obvious and by the second half of 1967 the Viet Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province seemed to have melted away , abandoning many of their bunker systems and avoiding the main roads and towns . The Battle of Long Tan and Operation Bribie had weakened the communist forces in the province , while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics . This prompted Graham to speculate that the Viet Cong may have fled to the border , perhaps leaving the province altogether . He reasoned that a succession of operations in the south @-@ east of the province and the completion of the barrier minefield at Dat Do meant that no single , sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy . Meanwhile , despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta , South Vietnam 's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful , with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide ; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent . Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long @-@ term effects of Australian operations in the province which had increased the population 's sense of security . During his tour of duty the task force had conducted 32 operations before he handed over command in October 1967 . He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) . 
 = = = Senior command = = = 
 After returning to Australia , Graham was subsequently appointed Chief of Staff , Northern Command in December 1967 . By 1969 a large percentage of Australian casualties in Vietnam were being caused by mines , including significant quantities of M16 anti @-@ personnel devices removed by the Viet Cong from the barrier minefield at Dat Do . Total Australian casualties from such mines were later estimated as 55 killed and 250 wounded , a figure which constituted approximately 11 percent of those killed during the war . These losses increasingly became a political issue as support for the war in Australia waned , and the efficacy of the decision was later criticised , both within the military and in the media . As the controversy surrounding the minefield grew , in February 1969 Graham was promoted to major general and appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff ( DCGS ) and Fifth Military Member of the Military Board , positions he held until 1972 . Meanwhile , after visiting Phuoc Tuy Province respected journalist Denis Warner concluded that although the original concept in laying the minefield had been sound , it was ultimately one of the greatest Australian mistakes of the war . By August 1969 work had begun to remove the minefield . 
 Graham was forced to publicly defend his decision , while questions were raised about the knowledge and approval of his decision as the tactical commander by a number of senior Army officers , including then Commander Australian Forces Vietnam , Major General Tim Vincent , the Chief of General Staff ( CGS ) , Lieutenant General Thomas Daly , and the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee , General John Wilton , all of whom had acquiesced to its construction . Meanwhile , as DCGS Graham was second only to Daly in the daily running of the Australian Army . During this time Graham unsuccessfully sought the retention of national service following the eventual Australian withdrawal from Vietnam , arguing that it was necessary to further expand the Regular Army . He later managed the draw @-@ down of Australian forces in Vietnam , and played a leading role in shaping the post @-@ war Army . Graham was appointed General Officer Commanding ( GOC ) Northern Command in 1973 and later Commander 1st Division . He subsequently filled the position of head of the Australian Defence Staff in London over the period 1974 – 76 . Graham was made an Officer of the Order of Australia ( AO ) in the 1975 Queen 's Birthday Honours . He retired in March 1977 .

 In his later life Graham and his wife settled on the Gold Coast in Queensland and were involved in community activities and fundraising . He enjoyed swimming and fishing and was involved in work to help the blind . He died at his home on the Isle of Capri on 20 July 1996 and was survived by his widow and two sons . Despite the debate surrounding the laying of the barrier minefield , McNeill and Ekins later described Graham as a " clever and imaginative " commander , who was " widely regarded as having one of the best minds in the army " , and whose " broad knowledge and fair approach earned him the respect of his subordinates . " Yet even in death Graham remained a controversial figure . In his book , The Minefield , published in 2007 , author and former Army officer Greg Lockhart argued that the decision to establish the minefield had been " reckless " ; the product of a failure to understand the prevailing nature of the insurgency in Phuoc Tuy Province , it had ended in " strategic disaster " . Lockhart argued that the decision ultimately cost Graham the position of CGS , even though he had been seen by some as being the likely candidate to replace Daly . He went on to describe Graham as ambitious and career @-@ driven , " ... a talented man who rose to a position of some importance and was undone by inescapable personal flaws . " 
 = Oklahoma State Highway 58 = 
 State Highway 58 ( abbreviated SH @-@ 58 ) is the name of two state highways in Oklahoma .

The northern section has one lettered spur route , SH @-@ 58A . 
 SH @-@ 58 was originally a part of US @-@ 164 . When US @-@ 164 was decommissioned in 1930 , a section of the road in Major County that was left without a designation became SH @-@ 58 . Since then , the highway has grown toward both the north and the south . With the designation and extension of the southern section of the highway , SH @-@ 58 is present in five counties in the western part of the state .

 = = History = = 
 SH @-@ 58 was first commissioned some time between March 1 , 1930 and December 1 , 1931 . The original extent of the route was much shorter than the present highway . In 1931 , SH @-@ 58 was a dirt road extending from SH @-@ 8 east of Fairview north to Ringwood . Prior to receiving the SH @-@ 58 designation , this section of road was part of US @-@ 164 and the first SH @-@ 13 . On May 29 , 1930 , AASHO approved an extension of US @-@ 60 that replaced US @-@ 164 . When US @-@ 60 replaced US @-@ 164 through the area , it was changed to the more westerly route it takes in the present day . The section of old U.S. highway that no longer had a designation became SH @-@ 58 . 
 Throughout the 1930s , SH @-@ 58 was expanded in both directions . The first addition to the highway came during the first half of 1932 , when the highway was extended north to Helena . No east – west highway existed at this point yet , leading to a spur end . The highway was extended to the south , replacing SH @-@ 44 , to Canton on March 29 , 1937 . SH @-@ 58 was extended north to the Kansas state line sometime between April 1937 and April 1938 . This final extension brought SH @-@ 58 's northern section to its present @-@ day termini , and no major changes to the northern section have occurred since . 
 SH @-@ 58 's southern section was first established on October 16 , 1945 , when SH @-@ 54 was given a new alignment further to the west ; its old alignment was redesignated as SH @-@ 58 . The original routing of SH @-@ 58 's southern section began at US @-@ 277 in Cyril , continued west through Apache , and turned north at the present @-@ day western intersection of with SH @-@ 19 . SH @-@ 58 continued north along its present alignment to Hydro , where it ended at US @-@ 66 / SH @-@ 1 . 
 In 1955 , SH @-@ 19 was established through southern Caddo County , taking over the east – west section of SH @-@ 58 . Thus , SH @-@ 58 was truncated to where it intersected with SH @-@ 19 ( the present day western end of their concurrency ) . SH @-@ 58 was extended to its present terminus north of Hydro the next year . The highway was further extended in 1964 , bringing the southern terminus to its present location near Medicine Park . No further routing changes have occurred since then .

 = One Voice ( Andrew Johnston album ) = 
 One Voice is the debut album by British boy soprano Andrew Johnston , who rose to fame in 2008 after his appearance on the second series of Britain 's Got Talent . The album was released on 29 September 2008 by Syco Music , Britain 's Got Talent judge Simon Cowell 's record label . Recorded in London , the album features both classical and popular songs , some of which had been previously performed by Johnston , including a duet with Faryl Smith . Johnston made a number of media appearances to publicise the album 's launch , and appeared in his hometown of Carlisle on the day of the release , where the album sold out . Upon release , One Voice debuted at number five in the British album charts , finishing the week at number four . It also charted in Ireland , reaching number six . Critics responded positively to the album , favourably comparing Johnston to Aled Jones , and One Voice was rated gold in the UK .

 Johnston first rose to fame when he tried out for the second series of reality show Britain 's Got Talent . Johnston reached the final , held on 31 May 2008 , and finished in third place . Despite this , it was announced that he had been signed by judge Simon Cowell 's label Syco Music in June , and that his debut album would be released in late 2008 . It was on the show that Johnston first performed a rendition of " Pie Jesu " , later described as " the song that made him famous " , as well as a cover of Eric Clapton 's " Tears in Heaven " . Both of these songs were recorded for One Voice , and so was a duet of " Walking in the Air " with fellow contestant Faryl Smith , first performed on the Britain 's Got Talent Live Tour . 
 = = Recording and release = = 
 The album was recorded immediately after Johnston finished the Britain 's Got Talent live tour over a six @-@ week period in London . The track listing , which contained both religious and popular songs , was chosen by Cowell ; Johnston said " I hadn 't sung many of the tracks before . But I knew them all and , anyway , I like a challenge . " Johnston described recording the album as " great " , and said " All I ’ ve ever wanted to do is go into a studio and record an album and it was everything I ’ ve ever dreamed of . " Johnson recorded " Walking in the Air " as a duet with fellow Britain 's Got Talent contestant Faryl Smith , and the song was tipped as a potential Christmas number @-@ one . The recording was finished by September 2008 , after which Johnston began to make appearances to publicise the release , including appearances on GMTV , Channel 5 News , BBC Breakfast , This Morning and Radio 2 's Friday Night Is Music Night . In preparation for the album 's promotion , Johnston received confidence tutoring . He said that " I 've got no confidence and sometimes people get on at me for being moody so I 've had some help with that . " Johnston also received vocal training from Yvie Burnett , who was , at the time , coaching Leona Lewis and Leon Jackson , and with whom Smith trained during Britain 's Got Talent . The album was produced by Nigel Wright . 
 The release of One Voice was highly anticipated , and demand was so great that it charted on both Amazon 's pre @-@ sales chart and the easy listening chart before its release . The album was released on 29 September , later than first announced , and was Syco 's first release in the fourth quarter . Johnston made an appearance at the city @-@ centre Woolworths store in his home town of Carlisle to celebrate the album launch on 1 October , and spoke to reporters for the local paper The Cumberland News , saying " I am really grateful to my local supporters and it is great to take part in my first signing here in Carlisle . " In February 2009 , the album was released in South Korea .

" Kate Leaver , writing for South Korea 's JoongAng Daily , said Johnston " has truer talent than hoards of his musical elders " and that " the vulnerability of this One Voice makes for a haunting musical experience . " 
 One Voice entered the UK Album Chart at number five , and finished the week at number four . It stayed in the top 75 for five weeks . Demand for the album in Johnston 's local area was so great that many Carlisle stores had sold out of the album the day after its release . In an interview published in the Daily Record , Johnston said " Thanks to everyone that has bought the album . You 've made my dreams come true " . The album has sold over 120 @,@ 000 copies , and was rated gold in the UK . Johnston was presented a gold disk by Penny Smith , and said that " it was such a surprise to see how well the album did " . The album also charted in the Irish Album Charts , entering at ten , peaking at six and spending a total of seven weeks in the top 75 .

 = Jacob van Ruisdael = 
 Jacob Isaackszoon van Ruisdael ( Dutch pronunciation : [ ˈjaːkɔp fɑn <unk> ] ; c . 1629 – 10 March 1682 ) was a Dutch painter , draughtsman , and etcher . He is generally considered the pre @-@ eminent landscape painter of the Dutch Golden Age , a period of great wealth and cultural achievement when Dutch painting became highly popular . 
 Prolific and versatile , Ruisdael depicted a wide variety of landscape subjects . From 1646 he painted Dutch countryside scenes of remarkable quality for a young man . After a trip to Germany in 1650 , his landscapes took on a more heroic character . In his late work , conducted when he lived and worked in Amsterdam , he added city panoramas and seascapes to his regular repertoire . In these , the sky often took up two @-@ thirds of the canvas . In total he produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls . 
 Ruisdael 's only registered pupil was Meindert Hobbema , one of several artists who painted figures in his landscapes . Hobbema 's work has at times been confused with Ruisdael 's . There is difficulty in attributing Ruisdael 's work , which has not been helped by the fact that three members of his family were also landscape painters , some of whom spelled their name " Ruysdael " : his father Isaack van Ruisdael , his well @-@ known uncle Salomon van Ruysdael , and his cousin , confusingly called Jacob van Ruysdael . 
 Ruisdael 's work was in demand in the Dutch Republic during his lifetime . Today it is spread across private and institutional collections around the world ; the National Gallery in London , the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam , and the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg hold the largest collections . Ruisdael shaped landscape painting traditions worldwide , from the English Romantics to the Barbizon school in France , and the Hudson River School in the US , and influenced generations of Dutch landscape artists . 
 = = Life = = 
 Jacob Isaackszoon van Ruisdael was born in Haarlem in 1628 or 1629 into a family of painters , all landscapists . The number of painters in the family , and the multiple spellings of the Ruisdael name , have hampered attempts to document his life and attribute his works . 
 The name Ruisdael is connected to a castle , now lost , in the village of Blaricum . The village was the home of Jacob 's grandfather , the furniture maker Jacob de Goyer . When De Goyer moved away to Naarden , three of his sons changed their name to Ruysdael or Ruisdael , probably to indicate their origin . Two of De Goyer 's sons became painters : Jacob 's father Isaack van Ruisdael and his well @-@ known uncle Salomon van Ruysdael . Jacob himself always spelled his name with an " i " , while his cousin , Salomon 's son Jacob Salomonszoon van Ruysdael , also a landscape artist , spelled his name with a " y " . Jacob 's earliest biographer , Arnold Houbraken , called him Jakob <unk> , and claimed the name resulted from his specialty in waterfalls , namely the " <unk> " ( rustling noise of water ) falling into a " <unk> " ( dale ) where it foams out into a pond or wider river . 
 It is not known whether Ruisdael 's mother was Isaack van Ruisdael 's first wife , whose name is unknown , or his second wife , Maycken <unk> . Isaack and Maycken married on 12 November 1628 . 
 Ruisdael 's teacher is also unknown . It is often assumed Ruisdael studied with his father and uncle , but there is no archival evidence for this . He appears to have been strongly influenced by other contemporary local Haarlem landscapists , most notably Cornelis Vroom and Allaert van Everdingen . 
 The earliest date that appears on Ruisdael 's paintings and etchings is 1646 . Two years after this date he was admitted to membership of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke . By this time landscape paintings were as popular as history paintings in Dutch households , though at the time of Ruisdael 's birth , history paintings appeared far more frequently . This growth in popularity of landscapes continued throughout Ruisdael 's career . 
 Around 1657 , Ruisdael moved to Amsterdam , by then a prosperous city which was likely to have offered a bigger market for his work . His fellow Haarlem painter Allaert van Everdingen had already moved to Amsterdam and found a market there . Ruisdael lived and worked in Amsterdam for the rest of his life . In 1668 , his name appears as a witness to the marriage of Meindert Hobbema , his only registered pupil , a painter whose works have been confused with Ruisdael 's own . 
 For a landscape artist , it seems Ruisdael travelled relatively little : to Blaricum , Egmond aan Zee , and Rhenen in the 1640s , with Nicolaes Berchem to Bentheim and <unk> just across the border in Germany in 1650 , and possibly with Hobbema across the German border again in 1661 , via the Veluwe , Deventer and <unk> . Despite Ruisdael 's numerous Norwegian landscapes , there is no record of him having travelled to Scandinavia . 
 There is some speculation that Ruisdael was also a doctor . In 1718 , his biographer Houbraken reports that he studied medicine and performed surgery in Amsterdam . Archival records of the 17th century show the name " Jacobus <unk> " on a list of Amsterdam doctors , albeit crossed out , with the added remark that he earned his medical degree on 15 October 1676 in Caen , northern France . Various art historians have speculated that this was a case of mistaken identity . Pieter <unk> suggests it was Ruisdael 's cousin who appeared on the record . The Ruisdael expert Seymour Slive argues that the spelling " <unk> " is not consistent with Ruisdael 's own spelling of his name , that his unusually high production suggests there was little time to study medicine , and that there is no indication in any of his art that he visited northern France . However , Slive is willing to accept that Ruisdael may still have been a doctor . In 2013 , Jan Paul Hinrichs agreed that the evidence is inconclusive . 
 Ruisdael was not Jewish . Slive reports that , because of Ruisdael 's depiction of a Jewish cemetery and various biblical names in the Ruisdael family , he often heard speculation that Ruisdael must surely be Jewish . The evidence shows otherwise . Ruisdael requested that he be baptised at the Calvinist Reformed Church in Amsterdam , and he was buried in the Saint Bavo 's Church , Haarlem , a Protestant church at that time . His uncle Salomon van Ruysdael belonged to the Young Flemish subgroup of the Mennonite congregation , one of several types of Anabaptists in Haarlem , and it is probable that Ruisdael 's father was also a member there . His cousin Jacob was a registered Mennonite in Amsterdam . 
 Ruisdael did not marry . According to Houbraken this was " to reserve time to serve his old father " . It is not known what Ruisdael looked like , as no known portrait or self @-@ portrait of him exists . 
 The art historian Hendrik Frederik Wijnman disproved the myth that Ruisdael died a poor man , supposedly in the old men 's almshouse in Haarlem . Wijnman showed that the person who died there was in fact Ruisdael 's cousin , Jacob Salomonszoon . Although there is no record of Ruisdael owning land or shares , he appears to have lived comfortably , even after the economic downturn of the disaster year 1672 . His paintings were valued fairly highly . In a large sample of inventories between 1650 and 1679 the average price for a Ruisdael was 40 guilders , compared to an average of 19 guilders for all attributed paintings . In a ranking of contemporary Dutch painters based on price @-@ weighted frequency in these inventories , Ruisdael ranks seventh ; Rembrandt ranks first . 
 Ruisdael died in Amsterdam on 10 March 1682 . He was buried 14 March 1682 in Saint Bavo 's Church , Haarlem .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Ruisdael 's work from c . 1646 to the early 1650s , when he was living in Haarlem , is characterised by simple motifs and careful and laborious study of nature : dunes , woods , and atmospheric effects . By applying heavier paint than his predecessors , Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality , conveying a sense of sap flowing through branches and leaves . His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented at the time : the genera of his trees are the first to be unequivocally recognisable by modern @-@ day botanists . His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work : a sense of spaciousness and luminosity , and an airy atmosphere achieved through pointillist @-@ like touches of chalk . Most of his thirty black chalk sketches that survive date from this period . 
 An exemplar of Ruisdael 's early style is Dune Landscape , one of the earliest works , dated 1646 . It breaks with the classic Dutch tradition of depicting broad views of dunes that include houses and trees flanked by distant vistas . Instead , Ruisdael places tree @-@ covered dunes prominently at centre stage , with a <unk> concentrating strong light on a sandy path . The resulting heroic effect is enhanced by the large size of the canvas , " so unexpected in the work of an inexperienced painter " according to Irina Sokolova , curator at the Hermitage Museum . The art historian Hofstede de Groot said of Dune Landscape : " It is hardly credible that it should be the work of a boy of seventeen " . 
 Ruisdael 's first panoramic landscape , View of Naarden with the Church at <unk> in the Distance , dates from 1647 . The theme of an overwhelming sky and a distant town , in this case the birthplace of his father , is one he returned to in his later years . 
 For unknown reasons , Ruisdael almost entirely stopped dating his work from 1653 . Only five works from the 1660s have a , partially obscured , year next to his signature ; none from the 1670s and 1680s have a date . Dating subsequent work has therefore been largely based on detective work and speculation . 
 All thirteen known Ruisdael etchings come from his early period , with the first one dated 1646 . It is unknown who taught him the art of etching . No etchings exist signed by his father , his uncle , or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom , who influenced his other work . His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt , either in style or technique . Few original impressions exist ; five etchings survive in only a single impression . The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays , which did not warrant large editions . The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out <unk> at the Edge of a Wood and The Travellers as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael 's genius . 
 = = = Middle period = = = 
 Following Ruisdael 's trip to Germany , his landscapes took on a more heroic character , with forms becoming larger and more prominent . A view of Bentheim Castle , dated 1653 , is just one of a dozen of Ruisdael 's depictions of a particular castle in Germany , almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop . Significantly , Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle 's setting ( it is actually on an unimposing low hill ) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain . These variations are considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael 's compositional skills . 
 On his trip to Germany , Ruisdael encountered water mills which he turned into a principal subject for painting , the first artist to ever do so . Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice , dated 1653 , is a prime example . The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael 's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery , of which he painted two versions . With these , Ruisdael pits the natural world against the built environment , which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery . 
 Ruisdael 's first Scandinavian views contain big firs , rugged mountains , large boulders and rushing torrents . Though convincingly realistic , they are based on previous art works , rather than on direct experience . There is no record that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia , although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre . Ruisdael 's work soon outstripped van Everdingen 's finest efforts . In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls , of which Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle , c . 1665 – 1670 , is seen as his greatest by Slive . 
 In this period Ruisdael started painting coastal scenes and sea @-@ pieces , influenced by Simon de <unk> and Jan Porcellis . Among the most dramatic is Rough Sea at a Jetty , with a restricted palette of only black , white , blue and a few brown earth colours . However , forest scenes remain a subject of choice , such as the Hermitage 's most famous Ruisdael , A Wooded Marsh , dated c . 1665 , which depicts a primeval scene with broken birches and oaks , and branches reaching for the sky amidst an overgrown pond . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 During Ruisdael 's last period he began to depict mountain scenes , such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River , dateable to the late 1670s . This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds . Ruisdael 's subjects became unusually varied . The art historian Wolfgang <unk> identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre , and Ruisdael 's work encompasses all but two of them , excelling at most : forests , rivers , dunes and country roads , panoramas , imaginary landscapes , Scandinavian waterfalls , marines , <unk> , winter scenes , town views , and nocturnes . Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre . 
 Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael 's most famous works . Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede , dated 1670 , shows Wijk bij Duurstede , a riverside town about 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) from Utrecht , with a dominant cylindrical windmill . In this composition , Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low @-@ lying land , water and expansive sky , so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill . The painting 's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum , with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt 's Night Watch and Vermeer 's View of Delft . Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael 's entire career . 
 Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage , a specific genre called <unk> , with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon . The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo 's Church , in which Ruisdael would one day be buried . 
 While Amsterdam does feature in his work , it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years . It does feature in his only known architectural subject , a drawing of the interior of the Old Church , as well as in views of the Dam , and the Panoramic view of the Amstel looking toward Amsterdam , one of Ruisdael 's last paintings . 
 Figures are introduced sparingly into Ruisdael 's compositions , and are by this period rarely from his own hand but executed by various artists , including his pupil Meindert Hobbema , Nicolaes Berchem , Adriaen van de Velde , Philips Wouwerman , Jan Vonck , Thomas de Keyser , Gerard van <unk> and Jan <unk> . 
 = = = Attributions = = = 
 In his 2001 catalogue raisonné , Slive attributes 694 paintings to Ruisdael and lists another 163 paintings with dubious or , he believes , incorrect attribution . There are three main reasons why there is uncertainty over whose hand painted various Ruisdael @-@ style landscapes . Firstly , four members of the Ruysdael family were landscapists with similar signatures , some of which were later fraudulently altered into Jacob 's . This is further complicated by the fact that Ruisdael used variations of his signature . This typically reads " <unk> " or the monogram " <unk> " , sometimes using a small italic ' s ' and sometimes a Gothic long ' s ' , such as on Landscape with Waterfall . Secondly , many 17th century landscape paintings are unsigned and could be from pupils or copyists . Finally , fraudsters imitated Ruisdaels for financial gain , with the earliest case reported by Houbraken in 1718 : a certain Jan <unk> the Elder could imitate Ruisdael 's style so well that he often sold them for real Ruisdaels , especially with figurines added in the style of the artist Wouwerman . There is no large @-@ scale systematic approach to ascertaining Ruisdael 's attributions , unlike the forensic science used to find the correct attributions of Rembrandt 's paintings through the Rembrandt Research Project . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Ruisdael has shaped landscape painting traditions from the English Romantics to the Barbizon school in France , and the Hudson River School in the US , as well as generations of Dutch landscape artists . Among the English artists influenced by Ruisdael are Thomas Gainsborough , J. M. W. Turner , and John Constable . Gainsborough drew , in black chalk and grey wash , a replica of a Ruisdael in the 1740s — now both paintings are housed in the Louvre in Paris . Turner made many copies of Ruisdaels and even painted fantasy views of a nonexistent port he called Port Ruysdael . Constable also copied various drawings , etchings and paintings by Ruisdael , and was a great admirer from a young age . " It haunts my mind and clings to my heart " , he wrote after seeing a Ruisdael . However , he thought Jewish Cemetery was a failure , because he considered that it attempted to convey something outside the reach of art . 
 In the 19th century , Vincent van Gogh acknowledged Ruisdael as a major influence , calling him sublime , but at the same time saying it would be a mistake to try to copy him . Van Gogh had two Ruisdael prints , The Bush and a <unk> , on his wall , and thought the Ruisdaels in the Louvre were " magnificent , especially The Bush , The Breakwater and The Ray of Light " . His experience of the French countryside was informed by his memory of Ruisdael 's art . Van Gogh 's contemporary Claude Monet is also said to be indebted to Ruisdael . Even Piet <unk> 's minimalism has been traced back to Ruisdael 's panoramas . 
 Among art historians and critics , Ruisdael 's reputation has had its ups and downs over the centuries . The first account , in 1718 , is from Houbraken , who waxed lyrical over the technical mastery which allowed Ruisdael to realistically depict water in waterfalls and the sea . In 1781 , Sir Joshua Reynolds , founder of the Royal Academy , admired the freshness and force of Ruisdael 's landscapes . A couple of decades later other English critics were less impressed . In 1801 , Henry Fuseli , professor at the Royal Academy , expressed his contempt for the entire Dutch School of Landscape , dismissing it as no more than a " transcript of the spot " , a mere " enumeration of hill and dale , clumps of trees " . Of note is that one of Fuseli 's students was Constable , whose admiration for Ruisdael remained unchanged . Around the same time in Germany , the writer , statesman and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe lauded Ruisdael as a thinking artist , even a poet , saying " he demonstrates remarkable skill in locating the exact point at which the creative faculty comes into contact with a lucid mind " . John Ruskin however , in 1860 , raged against Ruisdael and other Dutch Golden Age landscapists , calling their landscapes places where " we lose not only all faith in religion but all remembrance of it " . In 1915 , the Dutch art historian Abraham Bredius called his compatriot not so much a painter as a poet . 
 More recent art historians have rated Ruisdael highly . Kenneth Clark described him as " the greatest master of the natural vision before Constable " . Waldemar Januszczak finds him a marvellous storyteller . Januszczak does not consider Ruisdael the greatest landscape artist of all time , but is especially impressed by his works as a teenager : " a prodigy whom we should rank at number 8 or 9 on the Mozart scale " . Slive states Ruisdael is acknowledged " by general consent , as the pre @-@ eminent landscapist of the Golden Age of Dutch art " . 
 Ruisdael is now seen as the leading artist of the " classical " phase in Dutch landscape art , which built upon the realism of the previous " tonal " phase . The tonal phase suggested atmosphere through the use of tonality , while the classical phase strived for a more grandiose effect , with paintings built up through a serious of vigorous contrasts of solid form against the sky , and of light against shade , with a tree , animal , or windmill often singled out . 
 Although many of Ruisdael 's works were on show in the Art Treasures Exhibition , Manchester 1857 , and various other grand exhibitions across the world since , it was not until 1981 that an exhibition was solely dedicated to Ruisdael . Over fifty paintings and thirty @-@ five drawings and etchings were exhibited , first at the Mauritshuis in The Hague , then , in 1982 , at the Fogg Museum in Cambridge , Massachusetts . In 2006 , the Royal Academy in London hosted a Ruisdael Master of Landscape exhibition , displaying works from over fifty collections . 
 = = = Interpretation = = = 
 There are no 17th century documents to indicate , either at first or second hand , what Ruisdael intended to convey through his art . While The Jewish Cemetery is universally accepted as an allegory for the fragility of life , how other works should be interpreted is much disputed . At one end of the spectrum is Henry Fuseli , who contends they have no meaning at all , and are simply a depiction of nature . At the other end is Franz Theodor Kugler who sees meaning in almost everything : " They all display the silent power of Nature , who opposes with her mighty hand the petty activity of man , and with a solemn warning as it were , repels his encroachments " . 
 In the middle of the spectrum are scholars such as E. John Walford , who sees the works as " not so much bearers of narrative or emblematic meanings but rather as images reflecting the fact that the visible world was essentially perceived as manifesting inherent spiritual significance " . Walford advocates abandoning the notion of " disguised symbolism " . All of Ruisdael 's work can be interpreted according to the religious world view of his time : nature serves as the " first book " of God , both because of its inherent divine qualities and because of God 's obvious concern for man and the world . The intention is spiritual , not moral . 
 Andrew Graham @-@ Dixon asserts all Dutch Golden Age landscapists could not help but search everywhere for meaning . He says of the windmill in The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede that it symbolises " the sheer hard work needed to keep Holland above water and to safeguard the future of the nation 's children " . The symmetries in the landscapes are " reminders to fellow citizens always to remain on the straight and narrow " . Slive is more reluctant to read too much into the work , but does put The Windmill in its contemporary religious context of man 's dependence on the " spirit of the Lord for life " . With regards to interpreting Ruisdael 's Scandinavian paintings , he says " My own view is that it strains credulity to the breaking point to propose that he himself conceived of all his depictions of waterfalls , torrents and rushing streams and dead trees as visual sermons on the themes of <unk> and vanitas " . 
 = = = Collections = = = 
 Ruisdaels are scattered across collections globally , both private and institutional . The most notable collections are at the National Gallery in London , which holds twenty paintings ; the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam , which holds sixteen paintings ; and the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg , which holds nine . In the US , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has five Ruisdaels in its collection , and the J. Paul Getty Museum in California has three . 
 On occasion a Ruisdael changes hands . In 2014 , Dunes by the Sea was auctioned at Christie 's in New York , and realised a price of $ 1 @,@ 805 @,@ 000 . Of his surviving drawings , 140 in total , the Rijksmuseum , the Teylers Museum in Haarlem , Dresden 's <unk> @-@ Kabinett , and the Hermitage each hold significant collections . Ruisdael 's rare etchings are spread across institutions . No collection holds a print of each of the thirteen etchings . Of the five unique prints , the British Museum holds two , two are in the Albertina in Vienna , and one is in Amsterdam . 
 = = Context = = 
 Ruisdael and his art should not be considered apart from the context of the incredible wealth and significant changes to the land that occurred during the Dutch Golden Age . In his study on 17th @-@ century Dutch art and culture , Simon Schama remarks that " it can never be overemphasized that the period between 1550 and 1650 , when the political identity of an independent Netherlands nation was being established , was also a time of dramatic physical alteration of its landscape " . Ruisdael 's depiction of nature and emergent Dutch technology are wrapped up in this . Christopher Joby places Ruisdael in the religious context of the Calvinism of the Dutch Republic . He states that landscape painting does conform to Calvin 's requirement that only what is visible may be depicted in art , and that landscape paintings such as those of Ruisdael have an epistemological value which provides further support for their use within Reformed Churches . 
 The art historian Yuri Kuznetsov places Ruisdael 's art in the context of the war of independence against Spain . Dutch landscape painters " were called upon to make a portrait of their homeland , twice rewon by the Dutch people – first from the sea and later from foreign invaders " . Jonathan Israel , in his study of the Dutch Republic , calls the period between 1647 and 1672 the third phase of Dutch Golden Age art , in which wealthy merchants wanted large , opulent and refined paintings , and civic leaders filled their town halls with grand displays containing republican messages . 
 As well , ordinary middle class Dutch people began buying art for the first time , creating a high demand for paintings of all kinds . This demand was met by enormous painter guilds . Master painters set up studios to produce large numbers of paintings quickly . Under the master 's direction , studio members would specialise in parts of a painting , such as figures in landscapes , or costumes in portraits and history paintings . Masters would sometimes add a few touches to authenticate a work mostly done by pupils , to maximise both speed and price . Numerous art dealers organised commissions on behalf of patrons , as well as buying uncommissioned stock to sell on . Landscape artists did not depend on commissions in the way most painters had to do , and could therefore paint for stock . In Ruisdael 's case , it is not known whether he kept stock to sell directly to customers , or sold his work through dealers , or both . Art historians only know of one commission , a work for the wealthy Amsterdam burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff , jointly painted with Thomas de Keyser . 
 = Zimbabwe = 
 Zimbabwe ( / <unk> / ) , officially the Republic of Zimbabwe , is a landlocked sovereign state located in southern Africa , between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers . It borders South Africa to the south , Botswana to the west , Zambia to the northwest , and Mozambique to the east and northeast . The capital and largest city is Harare . A country of roughly 13 million people , Zimbabwe has 16 official languages , with English , Shona , and Ndebele the most commonly used . 
 Since the 11th century , present @-@ day Zimbabwe has been the site of several organised states and kingdoms as well as a major route for migration and trade . The British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes first demarcated the present territory during the 1890s ; it became the self @-@ governing British colony of Southern Rhodesia in 1923 . In 1965 , the conservative white minority government unilaterally declared independence as Rhodesia . The state endured international isolation and a 15 @-@ year guerrilla war with black nationalist forces ; this culminated in a peace agreement that established universal enfranchisement and de jure sovereignty in April 1980 . Zimbabwe then rejoined the Commonwealth of Nations — which it withdrew from in 2003 — and became a member of the United Nations and the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) . 
 Robert Mugabe became Prime Minister of Zimbabwe in 1980 , when his ZANU @-@ PF party won the elections following the end of white minority rule ; he has been the president of Zimbabwe since 1987 . Under Mugabe 's authoritarian regime , the state security apparatus has dominated the country and been responsible for widespread human rights violations . Mugabe has maintained the revolutionary socialist rhetoric from the Cold War era , blaming Zimbabwe 's economic woes on conspiring Western capitalist countries . <unk> by his anti @-@ imperialist credentials , contemporary African political leaders have been reluctant to criticise Mugabe , though Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called him " a cartoon figure of an archetypal African dictator . " 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name " Zimbabwe " is based on a Shona term for Great Zimbabwe , an ancient ruined city in the country 's south @-@ east whose remains are now a protected site . There are two theories on the origin of the word . Many sources hold that the word is derived from dzimba @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , translated from the Karanga dialect of Shona as " large houses of stone " ( dzimba 
 = plural of <unk> , " house " ; <unk> = 
 plural of <unk> , " stone " ) . The Karanga @-@ speaking Shona people are found around Great Zimbabwe in the modern @-@ day province of Masvingo . Archaeologist Peter <unk> claims that " Zimbabwe " is a contracted form of dzimba @-@ <unk> which means " venerated houses " in the Zezuru dialect of Shona , and is usually applied to chiefs ' houses or graves . 
 Zimbabwe was formerly known as Southern Rhodesia ( 1898 ) , Rhodesia ( 1965 ) , and Zimbabwe Rhodesia ( 1979 ) . The first recorded use of " Zimbabwe " as a term of national reference was in 1960 , when it was coined by the black nationalist Michael Mawema , whose Zimbabwe National Party became the first to officially use the name in 1961 . The term Rhodesia — derived from the surname of Cecil Rhodes , the primary instigator of British colonisation of the territory during the late 19th century — was perceived as inappropriate because of its colonial origin and connotations . 
 According to Mawema , black nationalists held a meeting in 1960 to choose an alternative name for the country , and names including <unk> and Monomotapa were proposed before his suggestion , Zimbabwe , prevailed . A further alternative , put forward by nationalists in Matabeleland , had been " Matopos " , referring to the Matopos Hills to the south of Bulawayo . 
 It was initially unclear how the chosen term was to be used — a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers to " <unk> " — but " Zimbabwe " was sufficiently established by 1962 to become the generally preferred term of the black nationalist movement . In a 2001 interview , black nationalist Edson <unk> recalled that the name was mentioned by Mawema during a political rally , " and it caught hold , and that was that " . The name was subsequently used by the black nationalist factions during the Second Chimurenga campaigns against the Rhodesian government during the Rhodesian Bush War . The most major of these were the Zimbabwe African National Union ( led by Robert Mugabe from 1975 ) , and the Zimbabwe African People 's Union , led by Joshua Nkomo from its founding in the early 1960s . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Pre @-@ colonial era ( 1000 – 1886 ) = = = 
 Proto @-@ Shona speaking societies first emerged in the middle Limpopo valley in the 9th century before moving on to the Zimbabwean highlands . The Zimbabwean plateau eventually became the centre of subsequent Shona states , beginning around the 10th century . Around the early 10th century , trade developed with Arab merchants on the Indian Ocean coast , helping to develop the Kingdom of Mapungubwe in the 11th century . This was the precursor to the more impressive Shona civilisations that would dominate the region during the 13th to 15th centuries , evidenced by ruins at Great Zimbabwe , near Masvingo , and other smaller sites . The main archaeological site uses a unique dry stone architecture . 
 The Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of sophisticated trade states developed in Zimbabwe by the time of the first European explorers from Portugal . They traded in gold , ivory , and copper for cloth and glass . 
 From about 1300 until 1600 , Mapungubwe was eclipsed by the Kingdom of Zimbabwe . This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe 's stone architecture , which survives to this day at the ruins of the kingdom 's capital of Great Zimbabwe . From c . 1450 – 1760 , Zimbabwe gave way to the Kingdom of Mutapa . This Shona state ruled much of the area that is known as Zimbabwe today , and parts of central Mozambique . It is known by many names including the Mutapa Empire , also known as Mwene Mutapa or Monomotapa as well as " <unk> , " and was renowned for its strategic trade routes with the Arabs and Portugal . The Portuguese sought to monopolise this influence and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century . 
 As a direct response to increased European presence in the interior , a new Shona state emerged , known as the Rozwi Empire . Relying on centuries of military , political and religious development , the Rozwi ( meaning " destroyers " ) expelled the Portuguese from the Zimbabwean plateau by force of arms . They continued the stone building traditions of the Zimbabwe and Mapungubwe kingdoms while adding muskets to their arsenal and recruiting a professional army to defend recent conquests . 
 Around 1821 , the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the <unk> clan successfully rebelled against King Shaka and created his own clan , the Ndebele . The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the Transvaal , leaving a trail of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the <unk> . When Dutch <unk> converged on the Transvaal in 1836 , they drove the tribe even further northward . By 1838 , the Rozwi Empire , along with the other smaller Shona states were conquered by the Ndebele and reduced to <unk> . 
 After losing their remaining South African lands in 1840 , Mzilikazi and his tribe permanently settled in the southwest of present @-@ day Zimbabwe in what became known as Matabeleland , establishing Bulawayo as their capital . Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental kraals , similar to those of Shaka , which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions . Mzilikazi died in 1868 and , following a violent power struggle , was succeeded by his son , Lobengula . 
 = = = Colonial era ( 1888 – 1965 ) = = = 
 In the 1880s , white colonists arrived with Cecil Rhodes 's British South Africa Company ( BSAC ) . In 1888 , Rhodes obtained a concession for mining rights from King Lobengula of the Ndebele peoples . He presented this concession to persuade the government of the United Kingdom to grant a royal charter to the company over Matabeleland , and its subject states such as Mashonaland as well . 
 Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column , a group of Europeans protected by well @-@ armed British South Africa Police ( BSAP ) through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury ( now Harare ) , and thereby establish company rule over the area . In 1893 and 1894 , with the help of their new Maxim guns , the BSAP would go on to defeat the Ndebele in the First Matabele War . Rhodes additionally sought permission to negotiate similar concessions covering all territory between the Limpopo River and Lake Tanganyika , then known as " <unk> " . 
 In accordance with the terms of aforementioned concessions and treaties , mass settlement was encouraged , with the British maintaining control over labour as well as precious metals and other mineral resources . 
 In 1895 , the BSAC adopted the name " Rhodesia " for the territory , in honour of Rhodes . In 1898 " Southern Rhodesia " became the official name for the region south of the Zambezi , which later became Zimbabwe . The region to the north was administered separately and later termed Northern Rhodesia ( now Zambia ) . Shortly after Rhodes ' disastrous Jameson Raid on the South African Republic , the Ndebele rebelled against white rule , led by their charismatic religious leader , Mlimo . The Second Matabele War lasted in Matabeleland until 1896 , when Mlimo was assassinated . Shona agitators staged unsuccessful revolts ( known as Chimurenga ) against company rule during 1896 and 1897 . 
 Following these failed insurrections , the Ndebele and Shona groups were finally subdued by the Rhodes administration , which organised the land with a disproportionate bias favouring Europeans , thus displacing many indigenous peoples . 
 Southern Rhodesia was annexed by the United Kingdom on 12 September 1923 . Shortly after annexation , on 1 October 1923 , the first constitution for the new Colony of Southern Rhodesia came into force . 
 Under the new constitution , Southern Rhodesia became a self @-@ governing British colony , subsequent to a 1922 referendum . Rhodesians of all races served on behalf of the United Kingdom during the two World Wars . Proportional to the white population , Southern Rhodesia contributed more per capita to both the First and Second World Wars than any other part of the Empire , including Britain itself . 
 In 1953 , in the face of African opposition , Britain consolidated the two Rhodesias with Nyasaland ( Malawi ) in the ill @-@ fated Central African Federation , which was essentially dominated by Southern Rhodesia . Growing African nationalism and general dissent , particularly in Nyasaland , persuaded Britain to dissolve the Union in 1963 , forming three separate divisions . While multiracial democracy was finally introduced to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland , however , Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy minority rule . 
 With Zambian independence , Ian Smith 's Rhodesian Front ( RF ) dropped the designation " Southern " in 1964 and issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence ( commonly abbreviated to " UDI " ) from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965 , intent on effectively repudiating the recently adopted British policy of " no independence before majority rule " . It was the first such course taken by a British colony since the American declaration of 1776 , which Smith and others indeed claimed provided a suitable precedent to their own actions . 
 = = = UDI and civil war ( 1965 – 1979 ) = = = 
 After the Unilateral Declaration of Independence ( UDI ) , the British government petitioned the United Nations for sanctions against Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with Smith 's administration in 1966 and 1968 . In December 1966 , the organisation complied , imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state . These sanctions were expanded again in 1968 . 
 The United Kingdom deemed the Rhodesian declaration an act of rebellion , but did not re @-@ establish control by force . A guerrilla war subsequently ensued when Joshua Nkomo 's Zimbabwe African People 's Union ( ZAPU ) and Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe African National Union ( ZANU ) , supported actively by communist powers and neighbouring African nations , initiated guerilla operations against Rhodesia 's predominantly white government . ZAPU was supported by the Soviet Union , the Warsaw Pact and associated nations such as Cuba , and adopted a Marxist – Leninist ideology ; ZANU meanwhile aligned itself with Maoism and the bloc headed by the People 's Republic of China . Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970 , following the results of a referendum the previous year , but this went unrecognised internationally . Meanwhile , Rhodesia 's internal conflict intensified , eventually forcing him to open negotiations with the militant nationalists . 
 In March 1978 , Smith reached an accord with three African leaders , led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa , who offered to leave the white population comfortably entrenched in exchange for the establishment of a biracial democracy . As a result of the Internal Settlement , elections were held in April 1979 , concluding with the United African National Council ( UANC ) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats . On 1 June 1979 , Muzorewa , the UANC head , became prime minister and the country 's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia . The Internal Settlement left control of the Rhodesian Security Forces , civil service , judiciary , and a third of parliament seats to whites . On 12 June , the United States Senate voted to lift economic pressure on the former Rhodesia . 
 Following the fifth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting ( CHOGM ) , held in Lusaka , Zambia from 1 to 7 August in 1979 , the British government invited Muzorewa , Mugabe , and Nkomo to participate in a constitutional conference at Lancaster House . The purpose of the conference was to discuss and reach an agreement on the terms of an independence constitution , and provide for elections supervised under British authority allowing Zimbabwe Rhodesia to proceed to legal independence . 
 With Lord Carrington , Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom , in the chair , these discussions were mounted from 10 September to 15 December in 1979 , producing a total of 47 plenary sessions . On 21 December 1979 , delegations from every major interest represented reached the Lancaster House Agreement , effectively ending the guerrilla war . 
 On 11 December 1979 , the Rhodesian House of Assembly voted 90 to nil to revert to British colonial status ( the ' aye ' votes included Ian Smith himself ) . The bill then passed the Senate and was assented to by the President . With the arrival of Lord Christopher Soames , the new Governor , just after 2 p.m. on 12 December 1979 , Britain formally took control of Zimbabwe Rhodesia as the Colony of Southern Rhodesia , although on 13 December Soames declared that during his mandate the name Rhodesia and Zimbabwe Rhodesia would continue to be used . Britain lifted sanctions on 12 December , and the United Nations on 16 December , before calling on its member states to do likewise on 21 December . Thus Zambia , Mozambique , Tanzania , Angola and Botswana lifted sanctions on 22 – 23 December ; Australia partly pre @-@ empted this , lifting all but trade sanctions on 18 December , and trade sanctions on 21 December . 
 = = = Independence era ( 1980 – present ) = = = 
 Zimbabwe 's first president after its independence was Canaan Banana in what was originally a mainly ceremonial role as Head of State . Robert Mugabe , leader of the ZANU party , was the country 's first Prime Minister and Head of Government . During the elections of February 1980 , Robert Mugabe and the ZANU party secured a landslide victory . 
 Opposition to what was perceived as a Shona takeover immediately erupted around Matabeleland . The Matabele unrest led to what has become known as Gukurahundi ( Shona : " the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains " ) . 
 The Fifth Brigade , a North Korean @-@ trained elite unit that reported directly to the Zimbabwean Prime Minister , entered Matabeleland and massacred thousands of civilians accused of supporting " dissidents " . 
 Estimates for the number of deaths during the five @-@ year Gukurahundi campaign ranged from 10 @,@ 000 to 30 @,@ 000 . Thousands of others were tortured in military internment camps . 
 The campaign officially ended in 1987 after Nkomo and Mugabe reached a unity agreement that merged their respective parties , creating the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front ( ZANU – PF ) . 
 Elections in March 1990 resulted in another victory for Mugabe and the Zanu @-@ PF party , which claimed 117 of the 120 contested seats . 
 During the 1990s , students , trade unionists , and other workers often demonstrated to express their growing discontent with Mugabe and Zanu @-@ PF party policies . In 1996 , civil servants , nurses , and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues . The general health of the population also began to significantly decline ; by 1997 an estimated 25 % of the population had been infected by HIV in a pandemic that was affecting most of southern Africa . 
 Land redistribution re @-@ emerged as the main issue for the Zanu @-@ PF government around 1997 . Despite the existence of a " willing @-@ buyer @-@ willing @-@ seller " land reform programme since the 1980s , the minority white Zimbabwean population of around 0 @.@ 6 % continued to hold 70 % of the country 's most fertile agricultural land . 
 In 2000 , the government pressed ahead with its Fast Track Land Reform programme , a policy involving compulsory land acquisition aimed at redistributing land from the minority white population to the majority black population . Confiscations of white farmland ( accompanied by brutality and corruption ) , continuous droughts , and a serious drop in external finance and other supports led to a sharp decline in agricultural exports , which were traditionally the country 's leading export @-@ producing sector . Some 58 @,@ 000 independent black farmers have since experienced limited success in reviving the gutted cash crop sectors through efforts on a smaller scale . 
 Accused of committing numerous human rights abuses and grossly mismanaging the economy , Mugabe and the Zanu @-@ PF party leadership found themselves beset by a wide range of international sanctions . In 2002 , the nation was suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations due to the reckless farm seizures and blatant election tampering . The following year , Zimbabwean officials voluntarily terminated its Commonwealth membership . 
 Following elections in 2005 , the government initiated " Operation <unk> " , an effort to crack down on illegal markets and slums emerging in towns and cities , leaving a substantial section of urban poor homeless . The Zimbabwean government has described the operation as an attempt to provide decent housing to the population , although according to critics such as Amnesty International , authorities have yet to properly substantiate their claims . 
 On 29 March 2008 , Zimbabwe held a presidential election along with a parliamentary election . The results of this election were withheld for two weeks , after which it was generally acknowledged that the Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai ( MDC @-@ T ) had achieved a majority of one seat in the lower house of parliament . 
 In a surprising moment of candour at the ZANU @-@ PF congress in December 2014 , President Robert Mugabe accidentally let slip that the opposition had in fact won the contentious 2008 polls by an astounding 73 % . 
 In late 2008 , problems in Zimbabwe reached crisis proportions in the areas of living standards , public health ( with a major cholera outbreak in December ) and various basic affairs . 
 In September 2008 , a power @-@ sharing agreement was reached between Tsvangirai and President Mugabe , permitting the former to hold the office of prime minister . Due to ministerial differences between their respective political parties , the agreement was not fully implemented until 13 February 2009 . By December 2010 , Mugabe was threatening to completely expropriate remaining privately owned companies in Zimbabwe unless " western sanctions " were lifted . 
 A 2011 survey by Freedom House suggests that living conditions have improved since the power @-@ sharing agreement . The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs states in its 2012 – 2013 planning document that the " humanitarian situation has improved in Zimbabwe since 2009 , but conditions remain precarious for many people " . 
 On 17 January 2013 , Vice President John Nkomo died of cancer at St Anne 's Hospital , Harare at the age of 78 . A new constitution approved in the Zimbabwean constitutional referendum , 2013 curtails presidential powers . 
 Mugabe was re @-@ elected president in the July 2013 Zimbabwean general election which The Economist described as " rigged . " ) . The Movement for Democratic Change alleged massive fraud and tried to seek relief through the courts . After winning the election , the Mugabe government doubled the civil service and , according to The Economist , embarked on " ... misrule and dazzling corruption . " 
 In July 2016 nationwide protests took place regarding the economic collapse in the country and the finance minister admitted " Right now we literally have nothing . " 
 = = Geography and environment = = 
 Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa , lying between latitudes 15 ° and 23 ° S , and longitudes 25 ° and 34 ° E. Most of the country is elevated , consisting of a central plateau ( high veld ) stretching from the southwest northwards with altitudes between 1 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 600 m . The country 's extreme east is mountainous , this area being known as the Eastern Highlands , with Mount <unk> as the highest point at 2 @,@ 592 m . 
 These highlands are renowned for their great natural beauty , with famous tourist destinations such as Nyanga , Troutbeck , Chimanimani , <unk> and <unk> Forest at Mount <unk> . About 20 % of the country consists of low @-@ lying areas , ( the low veld ) under <unk> . Victoria Falls , one of the world 's biggest and most spectacular waterfalls , is located in the country 's extreme northwest and is part of the Zambezi river . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Zimbabwe has a tropical climate with many local variations . The southern areas are known for their heat and aridity , parts of the central plateau receive frost in winter , the Zambezi valley is also known for its extreme heat and the Eastern Highlands usually experience cool temperatures and the highest rainfall in the country . The country 's rainy season generally runs from late October to March and the hot climate is moderated by increasing altitude . Zimbabwe is faced with recurring droughts , the latest one commencing early in 2015 and ongoing into 2016 . Severe storms are rare . 
 = = = Flora and fauna = = = 
 The country is mostly savannah , although the moist and mountainous eastern highlands support areas of tropical evergreen and hardwood forests . Trees found in these Eastern Highlands include teak , mahogany , enormous specimens of strangling fig , forest <unk> , big leaf , white <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and many others . 
 In the low @-@ lying parts of the country fever trees , <unk> , <unk> and baobabs abound . Much of the country is covered by miombo woodland , dominated by <unk> species and others . Among the numerous flowers and shrubs are hibiscus , flame lily , snake lily , spider lily , <unk> , cassia , tree wisteria and <unk> . There are around 350 species of mammals that can be found in Zimbabwe . There are also many snakes and lizards , over 500 bird species , and 131 fish species . 
 = = = Environmental issues = = = 
 Large parts of Zimbabwe were once covered by forests with abundant wildlife . Deforestation and poaching has reduced the amount of wildlife . Woodland degradation and deforestation , due to population growth , urban expansion and lack of fuel , are major concerns and have led to erosion and land degradation which diminish the amount of fertile soil . Local farmers have also been criticised by environmentalists for burning off vegetation to heat their tobacco barns . 
 At the current rate of deforestation , Zimbabwe 's natural woodland is expected to disappear by 2065 . 
 = = Government and politics = = 
 Zimbabwe is a republic with a presidential system of government . The semi @-@ presidential system was done away with the adoption of a new constitution after a referendum in March 2013 . Under the constitutional changes in 2005 , an upper chamber , the Senate , was reinstated . The House of Assembly is the lower chamber of Parliament . President Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front ( commonly abbreviated ZANU @-@ PF ) has been the dominant political party in Zimbabwe since independence . 
 In 1987 then @-@ prime minister Mugabe revised the constitution , abolishing the ceremonial presidency and the prime ministerial posts to form an executive president , a Presidential system . His ZANU party has won every election since independence , in the 1990 election the second @-@ placed party , Edgar <unk> 's Zimbabwe Unity Movement , won only 20 % of the vote . 
 During the 1995 parliamentary elections most opposition parties , including the <unk> , boycotted the voting , resulting in a near @-@ sweep by the ruling party . When the opposition returned to the polls in 2000 , they won 57 seats , only five fewer than ZANU . 
 Presidential elections were again held in 2002 amid allegations of vote @-@ rigging , intimidation and fraud . The 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections were held on 31 March and multiple claims of vote rigging , election fraud and intimidation were made by the MDC and Jonathan Moyo , calling for investigations into 32 of the 120 constituencies . Jonathan Moyo participated in the elections despite the allegations and won a seat as an independent member of Parliament . 
 General elections were again held in Zimbabwe on 30 March 2008 . The official results required a runoff between Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai , the opposition leader ; the MDC challenged these results , claiming widespread election fraud by the Mugabe government . 
 The run @-@ off was scheduled for 27 June 2008 . On 22 June , citing the continuing unfairness of the process and refusing to participate in a " violent , illegitimate sham of an election process " , Tsvangirai pulled out of the presidential run @-@ off , the <unk> held the run @-@ off and President Mugabe received a landslide majority . 
 The MDC @-@ T led by Morgan Tsvangirai is now the majority in the Lower chamber of Parliament . The MDC split into two factions . One faction ( MDC @-@ M ) , now led by Arthur Mutambara contested the elections to the Senate , while the other , led by Tsvangirai , opposed to contesting the elections , stating that participation in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe 's claim that past elections were free and fair . The opposition parties have resumed participation in national and local elections as recently as 2006 . The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2006 with Tsvangirai being elected to lead MDC @-@ T , which has become more popular than the other group . 
 Mutambara , a robotics professor and former NASA robotics specialist has replaced Welshman <unk> who was the interim leader of MDC @-@ M after the split . Morgan Tsvangirai did not participate in the Senate elections , while the Mutambara faction participated and won five seats in the senate . The Mutambara formation has been weakened by defections from MPs and individuals who are disillusioned by their manifesto . As of 2008 , the Movement for Democratic Change has become the most popular , with crowds as large as 20 @,@ 000 attending their rallies as compared to between 500 – 5 @,@ 000 for the other formation . 
 On 28 April 2008 , Tsvangirai and Mutambara announced at a joint news conference in Johannesburg that the two MDC formations were co @-@ operating , enabling the MDC to have a clear parliamentary majority . Tsvangirai said that Mugabe could not remain President without a parliamentary majority . On the same day , <unk> announced that the recounts for the final five constituencies had been completed , that the results were being collated and that they would be published on 29 April . 
 In mid @-@ September 2008 , after protracted negotiations overseen by the leaders of South Africa and Mozambique , Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed a power @-@ sharing deal which would see Mugabe retain control over the army . Donor nations have adopted a ' wait @-@ and @-@ see ' attitude , wanting to see real change being brought about by this merger before committing themselves to funding rebuilding efforts , which are estimated to take at least five years . On 11 February 2009 Tsvangirai was sworn in as Prime Minister by President Mugabe . 
 In November 2008 , the government of Zimbabwe spent US $ 7 @.@ 3 million donated by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria . A representative of the organisation declined to speculate on how the money was spent , except that it was not for the intended purpose , and the government has failed to honour requests to return the money . 
 In February 2013 , Zimbabwe 's election chief , Simpson <unk> , resigned due to ill health . His resignation came months before the country 's constitutional referendum and elections . 
 = = = Human rights = = = 
 There are widespread reports of systematic and escalating violations of human rights in Zimbabwe under the Mugabe administration and his party , the ZANU @-@ PF . 
 In 2011 , there were reports of 640 corpses having been recovered from the Monkey William Mine in <unk> . They were allegedly authenticated by the Fallen Heroes Trust of Zimbabwe and the Department of National Museums and Monuments who are leading the exhumation process as victims of the Ian Smith regime during the liberation war . One body was identified as a ZANLA cadre , <unk> <unk> , by the Fallen Heroes Trust Chief <unk> . 
 Government Minister Saviour <unk> admitted the remains were discovered in 2008 , but claimed the remains were decades old despite clear evidence the exhumed skeletons still had hair and clothes . Solidarity Peace Trust said that the presence of soft tissues " is not necessarily an indicator that these bones entered the grave more recently , although it could be . " 
 Journalists found a body in the mine with ' what appeared to be blood and fluids dripping onto the skulls below ' . The opposition MDC called for research on all violence that included killings of its supporters during disputed elections in 2008 . Amnesty International ( AI ) expressed concern that " international best practice on exhumations is not being adhered to ... [ M ] <unk> of these mass graves has serious implications on potential exhumations of other sites in Zimbabwe . Thousands of civilians were also killed in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces in the mid 1980s and are allegedly buried in mine shafts and mass graves in these regions " , AI added . 
 According to human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch the government of Zimbabwe violates the rights to shelter , food , freedom of movement and residence , freedom of assembly and the protection of the law . There have been alleged assaults on the media , the political opposition , civil society activists , and human rights defenders . 
 Opposition gatherings are frequently the subject of brutal attacks by the police force , such as the crackdown on an 11 March 2007 Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) rally and several others during the 2008 election campaign . 
 In the attacks of 2007 , party leader Morgan Tsvangirai and 49 other opposition activists were arrested and severely beaten by the police . After his release , Morgan Tsvangirai told the BBC that he suffered head injuries and blows to the arms , knees and back , and that he lost a significant amount of blood . 
 Police action was strongly condemned by the UN Secretary @-@ General , Ban Ki @-@ moon , the European Union and the United States . While noting that the activists had suffered injuries , but not mentioning the cause of them , the Zimbabwean government @-@ controlled daily newspaper The Herald claimed the police had intervened after demonstrators " ran amok looting shops , destroying property , mugging civilians , and assaulting police officers and innocent members of the public " . The newspaper argued that the opposition had been " willfully violating the ban on political rallies " . 
 There are also abuses of media rights and access . The Zimbabwean government suppresses freedom of the press and freedom of speech . It has been repeatedly accused of using the public broadcaster , the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation , as a propaganda tool . Newspapers critical of the government , such as the Daily News , closed after bombs exploded at their offices and the government refused to renew their license . BBC News , Sky News , and CNN were banned from filming or reporting from Zimbabwe . In 2009 reporting restrictions on the BBC and CNN were lifted . Sky News continue to report on happenings within Zimbabwe from neighbouring countries like South Africa . 
 = = = Armed forces = = = 
 The Zimbabwe Defence Forces were set up by the integration of three belligerent forces – the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) , the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ( ZIPRA ) , and the Rhodesian Security Forces ( RSF ) – after the Second Chimurenga and Zimbabwean independence in 1980 . The integration period saw the formation of The Zimbabwe National Army ( ZNA ) and Air Force of Zimbabwe ( AFZ ) as separate entities under the command of <unk> General Solomon <unk> and Air Marshal Norman Walsh who retired in 1982 , and was replaced by Air Marshal Azim <unk> who handed over command to the late <unk> Air Chief Marshal Josiah <unk> in 1985 . 
 In December 2003 , General Constantine <unk> , was promoted and appointed Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces . Lieutenant General P. V. Sibanda replaced him as Commander of the Army . 
 The ZNA currently has an active duty strength of 30 @,@ 000 . The Air Force has about 5 @,@ 139 men assigned . The Zimbabwe Republic Police ( includes Police Support Unit , Paramilitary Police ) is part of the defence force of Zimbabwe and numbers 25 @,@ 000 . 
 Following majority rule in early 1980 , British Army trainers oversaw the integration of guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces . For the first year , a system was followed where the top @-@ performing candidate became battalion commander . If he or she was from ZANLA , then his or her second @-@ in @-@ command was the top @-@ performing ZIPRA candidate , and vice versa . This ensured a balance between the two movements in the command structure . From early 1981 , this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments , and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA . 
 The ZNA was originally formed into four brigades , composed of a total of 28 battalions . The brigade support units were composed almost entirely of specialists of the former Rhodesian Army , while <unk> battalions of the Rhodesian African Rifles were assigned to the 1st , 3rd and 4th Brigades . The Fifth Brigade was formed in 1981 and disbanded in 1988 after the demonstration of mass brutality and murder during the brigade 's occupation of Matabeleland in what has become known as Gukurahundi ( Shona : " the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains " ) , the campaign which finished off Mugabe 's liberation struggle . The Brigade had been reformed by 2006 , with its commander , Brigadier @-@ General John <unk> praising its " rich history " . 
 = = = Administrative divisions = = = 
 Zimbabwe has a centralised government and is divided into eight provinces and two cities with provincial status , for administrative purposes . Each province has a provincial capital from where official business is usually carried out . 
 The names of most of the provinces were generated from the Mashonaland and Matabeleland divide at the time of colonisation : Mashonaland was the territory occupied first by the British South Africa Company Pioneer Column and Matabeleland the territory conquered during the First Matabele War . This corresponds roughly to the precolonial territory of the Shona people and the Matabele people , although there are significant ethnic minorities in most provinces . Each province is headed by a Provincial Governor , appointed by the President . 
 The provincial government is run by a Provincial Administrator , appointed by the Public Service Commission . Other government functions at provincial level are carried out by provincial offices of national government departments . 
 The provinces are subdivided into 59 districts and 1 @,@ 200 wards ( sometimes referred to as municipalities ) . Each district is headed by a District Administrator , appointed by the Public Service Commission . There is also a Rural District Council , which appoints a chief executive officer . The Rural District Council is composed of elected ward councillors , the District Administrator and one representative of the chiefs ( traditional leaders appointed under customary law ) in the district . Other government functions at district level are carried out by district offices of national government departments . 
 At the ward level there is a Ward Development Committee , comprising the elected ward councillor , the <unk> ( traditional leaders subordinate to chiefs ) and representatives of Village Development Committees . Wards are subdivided into villages , each of which has an elected Village Development Committee and a <unk> ( traditional leader subordinate to the <unk> ) . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Mineral exports , gold , agriculture , and tourism are the main foreign currency earners of Zimbabwe . 
 The mining sector remains very lucrative , with some of the world 's largest platinum reserves being mined by Anglo American plc and Impala Platinum . The <unk> diamond fields , discovered in 2006 , are considered the biggest diamond find in over a century . They have the potential to improve the fiscal situation of the country considerably , but almost all revenues from the field have disappeared into the pockets of army officers and ZANU @-@ PF politicians . 
 In terms of carats produced , the <unk> field is one of the largest diamond producing projects in the world , estimated to produce 12 million carats in 2014 worth over $ 350 million . Zimbabwe is the biggest trading partner of South Africa on the continent . 
 Taxes and tariffs are high for private enterprises , while state enterprises are strongly subsidised . State regulation is costly to companies ; starting or closing a business is slow and costly . Government spending was predicted to reach 67 % of GDP in 2007 . 
 Tourism was an important industry for the country , but has been failing in recent years . The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force released a report in June 2007 , estimating 60 % of Zimbabwe 's wildlife has died since 2000 due to poaching and deforestation . The report warns that the loss of life combined with widespread deforestation is potentially disastrous for the tourist industry . 
 The ICT sector of Zimbabwe has been growing at a fast pace . A report by the mobile internet browser company , Opera , in June / July 2011 has ranked Zimbabwe as Africa 's fastest growing market . 
 Since 1 January 2002 , the government of Zimbabwe has had its lines of credit at international financial institutions frozen , through US legislation called the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 ( <unk> ) . Section 4C instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to direct directors at international financial institutions to veto the extension of loans and credit to the Zimbabwean government . According to the United States , these sanctions target only seven specific businesses owned or controlled by government officials and not ordinary citizens . 
 An independent study has shown that the sanctions have adversely affected the welfare of ordinary citizens . 
 Zimbabwe maintained positive economic growth throughout the 1980s ( 5 % GDP growth per year ) and 1990s ( 4 @.@ 3 % GDP growth per year ) . The economy declined from 2000 : 5 % decline in 2000 , 8 % in 2001 , 12 % in 2002 and 18 % in 2003 . Zimbabwe 's involvement from 1998 to 2002 in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy . 
 The downward spiral of the economy has been attributed mainly to mismanagement and corruption by the government and the eviction of more than 4 @,@ 000 white farmers in the controversial land confiscations of 2000 . The Zimbabwean government and its supporters attest that it was Western policies to avenge the expulsion of their kin that sabotaged the economy . 
 By 2005 , the purchasing power of the average Zimbabwean had dropped to the same levels in real terms as 1953 . In 2005 , the government , led by central bank governor Gideon Gono , started making overtures that white farmers could come back . There were 400 to 500 still left in the country , but much of the land that had been confiscated was no longer productive . 
 In January 2007 , the government issued long term leases to some white farmers . At the same time , however , the government also continued to demand that all remaining white farmers , who were given eviction notices earlier , vacate the land or risk being arrested . Mugabe pointed to foreign governments and alleged " sabotage " as the cause of the fall of the Zimbabwean economy , as well as the country 's 80 % formal unemployment rate . 
 Inflation rose from an annual rate of 32 % in 1998 , to an official estimated high of 11 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 % in August 2008 according to the country 's Central Statistical Office . This represented a state of hyperinflation , and the central bank introduced a new 100 billion dollar note . 
 On 29 January 2009 , in an effort to counteract runaway inflation , acting Finance Minister Patrick <unk> announced that Zimbabweans will be permitted to use other , more stable currencies to do business , alongside the Zimbabwe dollar . In an effort to combat inflation and foster economic growth the Zimbabwean Dollar was suspended indefinitely on 12 April 2009 . Zimbabwe now allows trade in the United States dollar and various other currencies such as the rand ( South Africa ) , the pula ( Botswana ) , the euro , and the Pound Sterling ( UK ) . 
 Since the formation of the Unity Government in 2009 , the Zimbabwean economy has been on the rebound . GDP grew by more than 5 % in the years 2009 and 2011 . In November 2010 , the IMF described the Zimbabwean economy as " completing its second year of buoyant economic growth " . 
 <unk> , the nation 's largest platinum company , has proceeded with US $ 500 million in expansions , and is also continuing a separate US $ 2 billion project , despite threats by Mugabe to nationalise the company . The pan @-@ African investment bank <unk> released a favourable report in February 2011 on investment prospects in Zimbabwe , citing an improved revenue base and higher tax receipts . 
 In late January 2013 , the Zimbabwean finance ministry reported that they had only $ 217 in their treasury and would apply for donations to finance the coming elections that is estimated to cost 107 million USD . 
 = = = Agriculture = = = 
 Zimbabwe 's commercial farming sector was traditionally a source of exports and foreign exchange , and provided 400 @,@ 000 jobs . However , the government 's land reform program badly damaged the sector , turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products . 
 For the past ten years , the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi @-@ Arid Tropics ( ICRISAT ) has been assisting Zimbabwe 's farmers to adopt conservation agriculture techniques , a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yields . By applying the three principles of minimum soil disturbance , legume @-@ based cropping and the use of organic mulch , farmers can improve infiltration , reduce evaporation and soil erosion , and build up organic soil content . 
 Between 2005 @-@ 11 , the number of smallholders practising conservation agriculture in Zimbabwe increased from 5000 to more than 150000 . Cereal yields rose between 15 and 100 per cent across different regions . 
 = = = Tourism = = = 
 Since the land reform programme in 2000 , tourism in Zimbabwe has steadily declined . After rising during the 1990s , ( 1 @.@ 4 million tourists in 1999 ) industry figures described a 75 % fall in visitors to Zimbabwe in 2000 . By December , less than 20 % of hotel rooms had been occupied . This has had a huge impact on the Zimbabwean economy . Thousands of jobs have been lost in the industry due to companies closing down or simply being unable to pay staff wages due to the decreasing number of tourists . 
 Several airlines have also pulled out of Zimbabwe . Australia 's Qantas , Germany 's Lufthansa , and Austrian Airlines were among the first to pull out and most recently British Airways suspended all direct flights to Harare . The country 's flagship airline Air Zimbabwe , which operated flights throughout Africa and a few destinations in Europe and Asia , ceased operations in February 2012 . 
 Zimbabwe has several major tourist attractions . Victoria Falls on the Zambezi , which are shared with Zambia , are located in the north west of Zimbabwe . Before the economic changes , much of the tourism for these locations came to the Zimbabwe side but now Zambia is the main beneficiary . The Victoria Falls National Park is also in this area and is one of the eight main national parks in Zimbabwe , the largest of which is Hwange National Park . 
 The Eastern Highlands are a series of mountainous areas near the border with Mozambique . The highest peak in Zimbabwe , Mount <unk> at 2 @,@ 593 m ( 8 @,@ 507 ft ) is located here as well as the <unk> Mountains and the Nyanga National Park . World 's View is in these mountains and it is from here that places as far away as 60 – 70 km ( 37 – 43 mi ) are visible and , on clear days , the town of <unk> can be seen . 
 Zimbabwe is unusual in Africa in that there are a number of ancient ruined cities built in a unique dry stone style . The most famous of these are the Great Zimbabwe ruins in Masvingo . Other ruins include <unk> Ruins , Zimbabwe , <unk> @-@ <unk> and <unk> , although none of these is as famous as Great Zimbabwe . 
 The Matobo Hills are an area of granite kopjes and wooded valleys commencing some 22 miles ( 35 km ) south of Bulawayo in southern Zimbabwe . The Hills were formed over 2 @,@ 000 million years ago with granite being forced to the surface , then being eroded to produce smooth " whaleback <unk> " and broken kopjes , strewn with boulders and interspersed with thickets of vegetation . Mzilikazi , founder of the Ndebele nation , gave the area its name , meaning ' Bald Heads ' . They have become famous and a tourist attraction due to their ancient shapes and local wildlife . Cecil Rhodes and other early white pioneers like Leander Starr Jameson are buried in these hills at a site named World 's View . 
 = = = Water supply and sanitation = = = 
 Water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe is defined by many small scale successful programs but also by a general lack of improved water and Sanitation systems for the majority of Zimbabwe . According to the World Health Organization in 2012 , 80 % of Zimbabweans had access to improved , i.e. clean , drinking @-@ water sources , and only 40 % of Zimbabweans had access to improved sanitation facilities . Access to improved water supply and sanitation is distinctly less in rural areas . 
 There are many factors which continue to determine the nature , for the foreseeable future , of water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe . Three major factors are the severely depressed state of the Zimbabwean economy , the willingness of foreign aid organizations to build and finance infrastructure projects , and the political stability of the Zimbabwean state . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 Zimbabwe 's total population is 12 @.@ 97 million . According to the United Nations World Health Organisation , the life expectancy for men was 56 years and the life expectancy for women was 60 years of age ( 2012 ) . An association of doctors in Zimbabwe has made calls for President Mugabe to make moves to assist the ailing health service . The HIV infection rate in Zimbabwe was estimated to be 14 % for people aged 15 – 49 in 2009 . UNESCO reported a decline in HIV prevalence among pregnant women from 26 % in 2002 to 21 % in 2004 . 
 Some 85 % of Zimbabweans are Christian ; 62 % of the population attends religious services regularly . The largest Christian churches are Anglican , Roman Catholic , Seventh @-@ day Adventist and Methodist . 
 As in other African countries , Christianity may be mixed with enduring traditional beliefs . Besides Christianity , ancestral worship is the most practised non @-@ Christian religion , involving spiritual intercession ; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which means " Voice of the Ancestors " , an instrument related to many <unk> ubiquitous throughout Africa , is central to many ceremonial proceedings . <unk> simply means " God the Creator " ( <unk> <unk> in Shona ) . Around 1 % of the population is Muslim . 
 Bantu @-@ speaking ethnic groups make up 98 % of the population . The majority people , the Shona , comprise 70 % . The Ndebele are the second most populous with 20 % of the population . 
 The Ndebele descended from Zulu migrations in the 19th century and the other tribes with which they intermarried . Up to one million Ndebele may have left the country over the last five years , mainly for South Africa . Other Bantu ethnic groups make up the third largest with 2 to 5 % : these are Venda , Tonga , <unk> , Kalanga , Sotho , <unk> , <unk> , Tswana , Xhosa and <unk> . 
 Minority ethnic groups include white Zimbabweans , who make up less than 1 % of the total population . White Zimbabweans are mostly of British origin , but there are also Afrikaner , Greek , Portuguese , French and Dutch communities . The white population dropped from a peak of around 278 @,@ 000 or 4 @.@ 3 % of the population in 1975 to possibly 120 @,@ 000 in 1999 , and was estimated to be no more than 50 @,@ 000 in 2002 , and possibly much less . The 2012 census lists the total white population at 28 @,@ 782 ( roughly 0 @.@ 22 % of the population ) , one @-@ tenth of its 1975 estimated size . Most emigration has been to the United Kingdom ( between 200 @,@ 000 and 500 @,@ 000 Britons are of Rhodesian or Zimbabwean origin ) , South Africa , Botswana , Zambia , Canada , Australia and New Zealand . Coloureds form 0 @.@ 5 % of the population , and various Asian ethnic groups , mostly of Indian and Chinese origin , are also 0 @.@ 5 % . 
 According to 2012 Census report , 99 @.@ 7 % of the population is of African origin . Official fertility rates over the last decade were 3 @.@ 6 ( 2002 Census ) , 3 @.@ 8 ( 2006 ) and 3 @.@ 8 ( 2012 Census ) .

 English is the main language used in the education and judiciary systems . The Bantu languages Shona and Sindebele are the principal indigenous languages of Zimbabwe . Shona is spoken by 70 % of the population , Sindebele by 20 % . Other minority Bantu languages include Venda , Tsonga , <unk> , Kalanga , Sotho , <unk> and <unk> . Less than 2 @.@ 5 % , mainly the white and " coloured " ( mixed race ) minorities , consider English their native language . Shona has a rich oral tradition , which was incorporated into the first Shona novel , <unk> by Solomon <unk> , published in 1956 . English is spoken primarily in the cities , but less so in rural areas . Radio and television news now broadcast in Shona , Sindebele and English . 
 Zimbabwe has 16 official languages and under the constitution , an Act of Parliament may prescribe other languages as officially recognised languages .

 Apart from the people who fled into the neighbouring countries , there are approximately 36 @,@ 000 internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) . There is no current comprehensive survey , although the following figures are available : 
 The above surveys do not include people displaced by Operation <unk> <unk> or beneficiaries of the fast @-@ track land reform programme but who have since been evicted .

 = = Culture = = 
 Zimbabwe has many different cultures which may include beliefs and ceremonies , one of them being Shona , Zimbabwe 's largest ethnic group . The Shona people have many sculptures and carvings which are made with the finest materials available . 
 Zimbabwe first celebrated its independence on 18 April 1980 . Celebrations are held at either the National Sports Stadium or <unk> Stadium in Harare . The first independence celebrations were held in 1980 at the Zimbabwe Grounds . At these celebrations doves are released to symbolise peace and fighter jets fly over and the national anthem is sung . The flame of independence is lit by the president after parades by the presidential family and members of the armed forces of Zimbabwe . The president also gives a speech to the people of Zimbabwe which is televised for those unable to attend the stadium . 
 = = = Arts = = = 
 Traditional arts in Zimbabwe include pottery , basketry , textiles , jewellery and carving . Among the distinctive qualities are symmetrically patterned woven baskets and stools carved out of a single piece of wood . Shona sculpture has become world famous in recent years having found popularity in the 1940s . Most subjects of carved figures of stylised birds and human figures among others are made with sedimentary rocks such as soapstone , as well as harder igneous rocks such as serpentine and the rare stone <unk> . Zimbabwean artefacts can be found in countries like Singapore , China and Canada. i.e. Dominic <unk> 's statue in the Singapore botanic gardens . 
 Shona sculpture in has survived through the ages and the modern style is a fusion of African folklore with European influences . World @-@ renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas , <unk> and Anderson <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Henry <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Internationally , Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence a new generation of artists , particularly Black Americans , through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe . Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro @-@ diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the United States . 
 Several authors are well known within Zimbabwe and abroad . Charles <unk> is renowned in Zimbabwe for writing traditional stories in English and in Shona and his poems and books have sold well with both the black and white communities . Catherine Buckle has achieved international recognition with her two books African Tears and Beyond Tears which tell of the ordeal she went through under the 2000 Land Reform . The first Prime Minister of Rhodesia , Ian Smith , wrote two books – The Great Betrayal and Bitter Harvest . The book The House of Hunger by <unk> <unk> won an award in the UK in 1979 and the Nobel Prize @-@ winning author Doris Lessing 's first novel The Grass Is Singing , the first four volumes of The Children of Violence sequence , as well as the collection of short stories African Stories are set in Rhodesia . In 2013 <unk> Bulawayo 's novel We Need New Names was shortlisted for the Booker Prize . The novel tells the story of the devastation and emigration caused by the brutal suppression of Zimbabwean civilians during the Gukurahundi in the early 1980s . 
 Internationally famous artists include Henry <unk> and Nicolas <unk> . A recurring theme in Zimbabwean art is the metamorphosis of man into beast . Zimbabwean musicians like Thomas <unk> , Oliver <unk> , the Bhundu Boys ; Alick <unk> and Audius Mtawarira have achieved international recognition . Among members of the white minority community , Theatre has a large following , with numerous theatrical companies performing in Zimbabwe 's urban areas . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 Like in many African countries , the majority of Zimbabweans depend on a few staple foods . " <unk> meal " , also known as cornmeal , is used to prepare sadza or <unk> , as well as porridge known as <unk> or <unk> . <unk> is made by mixing the cornmeal with water to produce a thick paste / porridge . After the paste has been cooking for several minutes , more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste . 
 This is usually eaten as lunch or dinner , usually with sides such as gravy , vegetables ( spinach , <unk> , or spring greens / collard greens ) , beans , and meat ( stewed , grilled , roasted , or <unk> ) . <unk> is also commonly eaten with curdled milk ( sour milk ) , commonly known as " lacto " ( <unk> <unk> ) , or dried Tanganyika sardine , known locally as <unk> or <unk> . <unk> is a thinner porridge , cooked without the additional cornmeal and usually flavoured with peanut butter , milk , butter , or jam . <unk> is usually eaten for breakfast . 
 <unk> , weddings , and any other family gatherings will usually be celebrated with the killing of a goat or cow , which will be barbecued or roasted by the family . 
 Even though the Afrikaners are a small group ( 10 % ) within the white minority group , Afrikaner recipes are popular . <unk> , a type of jerky , is a popular snack , prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade . <unk> is served with sadza . It is a long sausage , often well @-@ spiced , composed of beef rather than pork , and barbecued . As Zimbabwe was a British colony , some people there have adopted some colonial @-@ era English eating habits . For example , most people will have porridge in the morning , as well as 10 o 'clock tea ( midday tea ) . They will have lunch , often leftovers from the night before , freshly cooked sadza , or sandwiches ( which is more common in the cities ) . After lunch , there is usually 4 o 'clock tea ( afternoon tea ) , which is served before dinner . It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner . 
 Rice , pasta , and potato @-@ based foods ( french fries and mashed potato ) also make up part of Zimbabwean cuisine . A local favourite is rice cooked with peanut butter , which is taken with thick gravy , mixed vegetables and meat . A potpourri of peanuts known as <unk> , boiled and <unk> maize , black @-@ eyed peas known as <unk> , and <unk> groundnuts known as <unk> makes a traditional dish called <unk> . <unk> can also be the above ingredients cooked individually . One can also find local snacks , such as <unk> ( roasted / popped maize kernels similar to popcorn ) , roasted and salted peanuts , sugar cane , sweet potato , pumpkin , and indigenous fruits , such as horned melon , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ( sugar plum ) , and many others . 
 = = = Sports = = = 
 Football is the most popular sport in Zimbabwe . The Warriors have qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations two times ( 2004 , 2006 ) . The Warriors are also 4 Time <unk> cup Champions ( 2000 , 2003 , 2005 , 2009 ) and 3 Times Runners @-@ Up . , rugby union also has a very strong following and cricket also has a following , traditionally among the white minority . Zimbabwe has won eight Olympic medals , one in field hockey at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow , and seven in swimming , three at the 2004 Summer Olympics and four at the 2008 Summer Olympics , all by Kirsty Coventry . 
 Rugby union is a significant sport in Zimbabwe . The national side have represented the country at 2 Rugby World Cup tournaments in 1987 and 1991 . The team are currently ranked 26 in the world by World Rugby . 
 Zimbabwe has also done well in the Commonwealth Games and All @-@ Africa Games in swimming with Kirsty Coventry obtaining 11 gold medals in the different competitions . Zimbabwe has also competed at Wimbledon and the Davis Cup in tennis , most notably with the Black family , which comprises Wayne Black , Byron Black and Cara Black . Zimbabwe has also done well in golf . The Zimbabwean Nick Price held the official World Number 1 status longer than any player from Africa has ever done in the 24 @-@ year history of the ranking . 
 Other sports played in Zimbabwe are basketball , volleyball , netball , and water polo , as well as squash , motorsport , martial arts , chess , cycling , <unk> , kayaking and horse racing . However , most of these sports don 't have international representatives but instead stay at a junior or national level . Notable cricket players from Zimbabwe include Andy Flower , the former coach of the England Cricket Team . 
 = = = Media = = = 
 The media of Zimbabwe is now once again diverse , having come under tight restriction between 2002 and 2008 by the government during the growing economic and political crisis in the country . The Zimbabwean constitution promises freedom of the media and expression . Since the appointment of a new media and information minister in 2013 the media is currently facing less political interference and the supreme court has ruled some sections of the strict media laws as unconstitutional . In July 2009 the BBC and CNN were able to resume operations and report legally and openly from Zimbabwe . CNN welcomed the move . The Zimbabwe Ministry of Media , Information and Publicity stated that , " the Zimbabwe government never banned the BBC from carrying out lawful activities inside Zimbabwe " . The BBC also welcomed the move saying , " we 're pleased at being able to operate openly in Zimbabwe once again " . 
 In 2010 the Zimbabwe Media Commission was established by the inclusive , power @-@ sharing government . In May 2010 the Commission licensed three new privately owned newspapers , including the previously banned Daily News , for publication . Reporters Without Borders described the decisions as a " major advance " . In June 2010 <unk> became the first independent daily newspaper to be published in Zimbabwe in seven years . 
 <unk> 's monopoly in the broadcasting sector was ended with the licensing of two private radio stations in 2012 . 
 Since the 2002 Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act ( <unk> ) was passed , a number of privately owned news outlets were shut down by the government , including Daily News whose managing director Wilf <unk> went on to form the influential The Zimbabwean . As a result , many press organisations have been set up in both neighbouring and Western countries by exiled Zimbabweans . Because the internet is currently unrestricted , many Zimbabweans are allowed to access online news sites set up by exiled journalists . Reporters Without Borders claims the media environment in Zimbabwe involves " surveillance , threats , imprisonment , censorship , blackmail , abuse of power and denial of justice are all brought to bear to keep firm control over the news . " The main published newspapers are The Herald and The Chronicle which are printed in Harare and Bulawayo respectively . The heavy @-@ handedness on the media has progressively relaxed since 2009 . 
 In its 2008 report , Reporters Without Borders ranked the Zimbabwean media as 151st out of 173 . The government also bans many foreign broadcasting stations from Zimbabwe , including the CBC , Sky News , Channel 4 , American Broadcasting Company , Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) , and Fox News . News agencies and newspapers from other Western countries and South Africa have also been banned from the country . 
 = = = Scouting = = = 
 It was in the Matabeleland region in Zimbabwe that , during the Second Matabele War , Robert Baden @-@ Powell , the founder of Scouting , and Frederick Russell Burnham , the American born Chief of Scouts for the British Army , first met and began their lifelong friendship . In mid @-@ June 1896 , during a scouting patrol in the Matobo Hills , Burnham began teaching Baden @-@ Powell woodcraft . Baden @-@ Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men , rich in exploration , tracking , fieldcraft , and self @-@ reliance . It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden @-@ Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham . 
 Scouting in the former Rhodesia and Nyasaland started in 1909 when the first Boy Scout troop was registered . Scouting grew quickly and in 1924 Rhodesia and Nyasaland sent a large contingent to the second World Scout Jamboree in <unk> , Denmark . In 1959 , Rhodesia hosted the Central African Jamboree at <unk> . In 2009 , Scouts celebrated 100 years of Scouting in Zimbabwe and hundreds of Scouts camped at Gordon Park , a Scout campground and training area , as part of these celebrations . 
 Besides scouting , there are also leadership , life skills and general knowledge courses and training experiences mainly for school children ranging from pre @-@ school to final year high school students and some times those beyond High school . These courses and outings , are held at places like Lasting Impressions ( Lasting Impressions ~ Zimbabwe on YouTube ) , Far and Wide Zimbabwe ( Far and wide . ) and Chimanimani Outward Bound ( <unk> Zimbabwe at the Wayback Machine ( archived 16 June 2007 ) ) , Just to name a few .

 The stone @-@ carved Zimbabwe Bird appears on the national flags and the coats of arms of both Zimbabwe and Rhodesia , as well as on banknotes and coins ( first on Rhodesian pound and then Rhodesian dollar ) . It probably represents the <unk> eagle or the African fish eagle . 
 The famous soapstone bird carvings stood on walls and monoliths of the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe , built , it is believed , sometime between the 13th and 16th centuries by ancestors of the Shona . The ruins , which gave their name to modern Zimbabwe , cover some 1 @,@ 800 acres ( 7 @.@ 3 km2 ) and are the largest ancient stone construction in Zimbabwe . 
 Balancing Rocks are geological formations all over Zimbabwe . The rocks are perfectly balanced without other supports . They are created when ancient granite intrusions are exposed to weathering , as softer rocks surrounding them erode away . They are often remarked on and have been depicted on both the banknotes of Zimbabwe and the Rhodesian dollar banknotes . The ones found on the current notes of Zimbabwe , named the <unk> Rocks , are located in Epworth , approximately 9 miles ( 14 km ) south east of Harare . There are many different formations of the rocks , incorporating single and paired columns of 3 or more rocks . These formations are a feature of south and east tropical Africa from northern South Africa northwards to Sudan . The most notable formations in Zimbabwe are located in the Matobo National Park in Matabeleland . 
 The National Anthem of Zimbabwe is " Blessed be the Land of Zimbabwe " ( Shona : " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " ; Zimbabwean Ndebele : " <unk> <unk> <unk> " ) . It was introduced in March 1994 after a nationwide competition to replace " Ishe <unk> Africa " as a distinctly Zimbabwean song . The winning entry was a song written by Professor Solomon <unk> and composed by Fred <unk> . It has been translated into all three of the main languages of Zimbabwe . 
 = = Health = = 
 At independence , the policies of racial inequality were reflected in the disease patterns of the black majority . The first five years after independence saw rapid gains in areas such as immunisation coverage , access to health care , and contraceptive prevalence rate . Zimbabwe was thus considered internationally to have an achieved a good record of health development . 
 Zimbabwe suffered occasional outbreaks of acute diseases ( such as plague in 1994 ) . The gains on the national health were eroded by structural adjustment in the 1990s , the impact of the HIV / AIDS pandemic and the economic crisis since the year 2000 . In 2006 , Zimbabwe had one of the lowest life expectancies according to UN figure – 44 for men and 43 for women , down from 60 in 1990 , but this has since recovered to 53 and 54 respectively . The rapid drop was ascribed mainly to the HIV / AIDS pandemic . Infant mortality rose from 6 % in the late 1990s to 12 @.@ 3 % by 2004 . 
 The health system has more or less collapsed . At the end of November 2008 , some operations at three of Zimbabwe 's four major referral hospitals had shut down , along with the Zimbabwe Medical School , and the fourth major hospital had two wards and no operating theatres working . Due to hyperinflation , those hospitals still open were not able to obtain basic drugs and medicines . The situation changed drastically after the Unity Government and the introduction of the multi @-@ currency system in February 2009 although the political and economic crisis also contributed to the emigration of the doctors and people with medical knowledge . 
 In August 2008 large areas of Zimbabwe were struck by the ongoing cholera epidemic . By December 2008 more than 10 @,@ 000 people had been infected in all but one of Zimbabwe 's provinces and the outbreak had spread to Botswana , Mozambique , South Africa and Zambia . On 4 December 2008 the Zimbabwe government declared the outbreak to be a national emergency and asked for international aid . 
 By 9 March 2009 The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimated that 4 @,@ 011 people had succumbed to the waterborne disease since the outbreak began in August 2008 , and the total number of cases recorded had reached 89 @,@ 018 . In Harare , the city council offered free graves to cholera victims .

 The education department has stated that 20 @,@ 000 teachers have left Zimbabwe since 2007 and that half of Zimbabwe 's children have not progressed beyond primary school . 
 The wealthier portion of the population usually send their children to independent schools as opposed to the government @-@ run schools which are attended by the majority as these are subsidized by the government . School education was made free in 1980 , but since 1988 , the government has steadily increased the charges attached to school enrollment until they now greatly exceed the real value of fees in 1980 . The Ministry of Education of Zimbabwe maintains and operates the government schools but the fees charged by independent schools are regulated by the cabinet of Zimbabwe . 
 Zimbabwe 's education system consists of 2 years of pre @-@ school , 7 years of primary and 6 years of secondary schooling before students can enter university in the country or abroad . The academic year in Zimbabwe runs from January to December , with three terms , broken up by one month holidays , with a total of 40 weeks of school per year . National examinations are written during the third term in November , with " O " level and " A " level subjects also offered in June . 
 There are seven public ( Government ) universities as well as four church @-@ related universities in Zimbabwe that are fully internationally accredited . The University of Zimbabwe , the first and largest , was built in 1952 and is located in the Harare suburb of Mount Pleasant . Notable alumni from Zimbabwean universities include Welshman <unk> ; Peter Moyo ( of <unk> ) ; Tendai <unk> , Secretary @-@ General for the MDC ; <unk> Hove , Zimbabwean poet , novelist and essayist ; and Arthur Mutambara , President of one faction of the MDC . Many of the current politicians in the government of Zimbabwe have obtained degrees from universities in USA or other universities abroad . 
 National University of Science and Technology ( <unk> ) is the second largest public research university in Zimbabwe located in Bulawayo . It was established in 1991 . The National University of Science and Technology strives to become a flourishing and reputable institution not only in Zimbabwe and in Southern Africa but also among the international fraternity of Universities . Its guidance , cultural values is the encouragement of all its members and society of those attitudes of fair mindedness , understanding , tolerance and respect for people and views which are essential for the attainment and maintenance of justice , peace and harmony at all times . 
 Africa University is a United Methodist related university institution located in <unk> which attracts students from at least 36 African countries . The institution has been growing steadily and has steady study material and learning facilities . The highest professional board for accountants is the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe ( <unk> ) with direct relationships with similar bodies in South Africa , Canada , the UK and Australia . A qualified Chartered Accountant from Zimbabwe is also a member of similar bodies in these countries after writing a conversion paper . In addition , Zimbabwean @-@ trained doctors only require one year of residence to be fully licensed doctors in the United States . The Zimbabwe Institution of Engineers ( <unk> ) is the highest professional board for engineers . 
 Education in Zimbabwe became under threat since the economic changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike because of low pay , students unable to concentrate because of hunger and the price of uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury . Teachers were also one of the main targets of Mugabe 's attacks because he thought they were not strong supporters .

In October 1974 , Keane was convicted of conspiracy and mail fraud for using his elected office to profit from illegal real estate deals . His wife , Adeline succeeded him as alderman and Edward Nedza as committeeman . In 1978 Nedza won the Illinois state Senate seat from the 5th Senate district , which encompasses the Humboldt Park neighborhood of Chicago , and much of the 31st ward . Nedza , a Polish @-@ American , recognized the growing Puerto Rican population in his district , and groomed Hispanics within the Democratic Party .

 Chicago @-@ area Latino groups contested the legislative district map of the Illinois General Assembly in United States federal court . The panel of judges that decided the case ordered a new map that gave Hispanics a majority in two Illinois House of Representatives districts in Chicago , the 9th , which is predominantly Puerto Rican , and the 20th , which is predominantly Mexican American . In 1982 , Nedza sponsored Berrios , at the time chief clerk to Cook County Board of ( Tax ) Appeals Commissioner Harry <unk> , in the 9th district . Berrios was one of three candidates who filed nominating petitions to run in the Democratic primary , but Berrios ran unopposed when the petitions of the other two candidates were successfully challenged . Republicans fielded no candidate in their primary , so Berrios ran unopposed in the general election , and at the age of 30 became the first Hispanic American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly . Berrios ran for re @-@ election unopposed in the Fall 1986 general election . He won re @-@ election twice , serving three two @-@ year terms . 
 Berrios maintained his job in Chicago as chief clerk of the Cook County Board of ( Tax ) Appeals while serving part @-@ time as a legislator in the state capital in downstate Springfield , Illinois . In December , 1985 he was one of 21 state legislators criticised for holding a second , taxpayer @-@ salaried government job in a report issued by the Coalition for Political Honesty , founded by Board of ( Tax ) Appeals Commissioner Patrick Quinn , later Illinois Treasurer , Lieutenant Governor and Governor .

In August , 1987 , Nedza was convicted on federal charges of using his political office for illegal financial gain . 
 Berrios allied with Alderman Edward Vrdolyak , during Chicago Mayor Harold Washington 's first term , the Council Wars era . In 1987 Raymond Figueroa , with Washington 's backing , defeated Berrios 's candidate for alderman , Miguel Santiago , which helped close the Council Wars . A year later Figueroa defeated Berrios for committeeman . In 1991 , Figueroa decided not to run for re @-@ election as alderman , and left the committeeman 's job the following year .

Berrios ran for the vacancy with the backing of the Democratic party organization . In the Democratic primary , Berrios won the nomination with a sizable margin over Jeffrey Paul Smith , an assistant corporation counsel with the City of Chicago whose candidacy was sponsored by Quinn , by then a former Commissioner . 
 When first elected to the Board of ( Tax ) Appeals in 1988 , Berrios was paid about $ 56 @,@ 000 a year . In October 1990 , Berrios added a part @-@ time job as a legislative aide to a political ally , Democratic State Representative Miguel Santiago .

Berrios responded to criticisms of his hiring of relatives and friends , said , 
 What you 're basically saying is that Joe Berrios should get out of politics . If my brothers or whoever wants to come and work in government , they shouldn 't be allowed to work in government .

 = = = Political fundraising from tax appeal lawyers = = = 
 Board of ( Tax ) Appeals Commissioner Berrios regularly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in campaign contributions from lawyers who appealed property tax assessments before the Board . Berrios controls five personal political action committees , not including the fund for the Cook County Democratic Party , which he also controls . Berrios collected more than $ 3 million in political contributions between 2000 and 2010 , 64 percent from property tax appeal lawyers . About one @-@ third of Berrios ’ campaign contributions in that decade came from the 15 property tax appeal law firms that gained the most for their clients between 2006 and 2008 , contributing almost $ 1 million to six political action committees controlled by Berrios and his daughter , Illinois State Representative Maria Antonia Berrios , Democrat of the 39th Illinois House district on Chicago 's northwest side . Berrios started 2008 with $ 1 @.@ 2 million in just one of his several campaign funds , much of it from attorneys who appeared before him . 
 Several of the most successful property tax appeal law firms in Cook County have strong political connections . From 2006 to 2008 , the tax appeal law firms that received the largest reductions for their clients were those of Representative Michael J. Madigan ( the Illinois House Speaker , a Chicago Democrat and close ally of Berrios ) , Patrick J. Cullerton ( the brother of Illinois State Senator John Cullerton , the president of the Illinois Senate ) , and Chicago Alderman Edward M. Burke . Simultaneously , Berrios worked as a registered lobbyist to Illinois state government on issues such as legalizing video poker . Berrios lobbies Madigan and Cullerton in Springfield , while the Assessor is critical to the lucrative commercial real @-@ estate tax appeals practices of law firms , including those of Madigan and Cullerton . " Illinois , thy name is conflict of interest , " wrote Better Government Association Executive Director Andy Shaw in the Chicago Tribune in 2009 .

 Cook County Assessor James Houlihan announced that he would not seek re @-@ election in 2010 . Within hours , Berrios said he planned to announce his candidacy for assessor . On February 2 , 2010 Berrios won the three @-@ way Democratic primary with 39 % of the vote , in a primary with the lowest turn @-@ out since 1958 . 
 Berrios ' candidacy was denounced by local editorial boards . The Chicago Tribune editorial board described Berrios as " a terrible candidate for the powerful office of assessor " and called the Democratic Party of Cook County 's slating of Berrios for Assessor a " miserable mistake , " citing " his disregard for basic ethical principles " and " patent conflicts of interest . " The Chicago Sun @-@ Times editorial board called the slating a " tragedy , " describing Berrios as " a fine example , in fact , of why Illinois needs serious campaign finance reform with teeth in it , " and citing Berrios ' lack of transparency on the Board of Review , his record of hiring family and friends , and his " cozy " relationship with Madigan . The Daily Herald editorial board called Berrios " the very antithesis of what the office needs . " A profile in Chicago Magazine described him as " a consummate insider in Illinois politics " and " a vivid example of the clout @-@ infested politics for which Illinois is famous . " 
 On Monday morning , September 13 , 2010 , while candidate Berrios was at a campaign fund @-@ raising breakfast , the Finance Committee of the Cook County Board met and approved a package of ethics reforms in response to Berrios , including a measure that required candidates for Assessor or the Board of Review to return contributions from property tax appeal lawyers of more than $ 1 @,@ 500 , and prohibiting public officials from conducting political activities while at work for the county or using county resources . " The law stinks , bottom line , " Berrios said . 
 Cook County Commissioner Forrest Claypool filed nominating petitions to run as an independent candidate for assessor . Berrios dropped a challenge to Claypool 's nominating petitions after Berrios ' lawyers examined Claypool 's 90 @,@ 000 signatures , 65 @,@ 000 more than required . Berrios prevailed in the November 2010 general election with 46 percent of the vote in a field that also included Republican Sharon <unk> @-@ Eckersall .

 Assessor Berrios was investigated by the Cook County Board of Ethics for allegedly accepting excessive political contributions from attorneys who argued property @-@ tax appeals before the Assessor and Board of Review . The Board of Ethics sent letters to 15 tax attorneys , warning that their donations to Berrios during the 2010 election cycle had exceeded the county campaign contribution limits . Berrios ' attorney objected that the regulation was " illegal " , and Berrios sought an advisory opinion from the Cook County State ’ s Attorney . In February 2011 , a Cook County Deputy State ’ s Attorney wrote an advisory opinion that the County Board lacked the home rule authority to limit campaign contributions to the Assessor and that state campaign finance law prevails . The County Board 's legal counsel issued an opinion that the new contribution limits were unconstitutional . Cook County commissioners scaled back the campaign finance reform law and the Cook County Board of Ethics dropped its investigation of Berrios ' campaign contributions .

 Days after taking office , Berrios hired his son , sister and Jaconetty to work for him , bringing them over from the property tax appeals board . The family members received raises in their new positions . Berrios also brought over from the property tax appeals board veteran staff member , Felix Cardona Jr . , the treasurer for Citizens for Maria A. Berrios , Berrios ' daughter 's campaign committee . Asked if the hirings confirmed past criticisms , Berrios said : " I still won the election . " 
 Patrick Blanchard , the county ’ s Inspector General , and <unk> Foster , Executive Director of the Cook County Board of Ethics , the County ’ s top two government <unk> , issued a joint advisory memo to County Board President Toni Preckwinkle , all 17 Cook County commissioners , and nine other elected county officials , including Berrios , warning them that hiring relatives violated county ethics laws . The Cook County Board of Ethics initiated an investigation of Berrios . The federal @-@ court appointed attorneys monitoring City of Chicago and Cook County compliance with the Shakman decrees , designed to prevent politics from influencing most personnel decisions , raised objections to as many as 27 hirings and firings in the first month of the Berrios administration of the Assessor 's office . On January 28 , 2011 , to comply with County Board President Preckwinkle ’ s request for across @-@ the @-@ board 16 percent budget cuts to help close an estimated $ 487 million budget shortfall , Berrios laid off 53 employees , of which 48 were members of unions , but Berrios ' relatives remained on the payroll .

Pikarski 's law firm had represented clients before the County Board of Review on which Berrios served , and had donated thousands of dollars to Berrios ' political campaigns . One day after the release of the joint investigations , Pikarski resigned . 
 In its final determination dated June 20 , 2012 the Cook County Board of Ethics recommended that Berrios remove his son and sister from the County payroll and fined Berrios $ 10 @,@ 000 total ( $ 5 @,@ 000 for each of two relatives he hired ) . " To me it ’ s not big deal , because I ’ ve been told by the state ’ s attorney they have no power over us , " Berrios said . A Chicago Tribune editorial called Berrios ' hiring of his relatives " a flagrant violation of the county 's ethics rules . " County Board President Preckwinkle said , 
 I 've always said throughout my political career that if you 're in public office , you should not hire your relatives . This is not appropriate . And it leads to the perception that government is only for friends and family . And that 's neither good nor right . 
 Preckwinkle fired Foster in May , 2013 . " Joe is a political ally , " Preckwinkle said . 
 Cook County State 's Attorney Anita Alvarez declined to represent Berrios or the Board of Ethics in the nepotism issue , citing conflict of interest . A Cook County Circuit Court judge appointed an outside lawyer to represent Berrios before the Board of Ethics beginning in April 2011 , and the firm billed the county $ 4 @,@ 773 for its work as of September , 2012 . The Board of Ethics rejected Berrios ' appeal of the final determination . By November , 2012 , 15 members of Berrios ' family were on state or county payrolls or receiving state or county pensions . Berrios topped the " Hall of Shame " category in " Chicago ’ s Best and Worst Politicians of 2012 " in Chicago Magazine 's December , 2012 issue . The Board of Ethics petitioned the courts for a special prosecutor , and a judge appointed attorney and former Chicago Inspector General David H. Hoffman . By March , 2013 , Berrios had billed the County $ 24 @,@ 716 for his defense against the Board of Ethics ' ruling .

The song is influenced by pop and R & B music genres , and features a piano and keyboard @-@ driven melody . Lyrically , the song is a dialogue in between Carey and her deceased father throughout the verses , and a universal salute to departed loved ones on the chorus . 
 The song received generally positive reviews , with many critics considering it a highlight from the album .

 During the conception of her ninth studio album Charmbracelet in 2002 , Carey 's estranged father , Alfred Roy , was diagnosed with cancer . After divorcing from Patricia , Carey 's mother , when the singer was only three , he kept only limited contact with her throughout the years , as Patricia continuously moved due to their poverty . During this period of Carey 's life , when she was just recovering from a breakdown and career slouch , she began reconnecting with her father during his short time in hospital care . In a song titled " Sunflowers for Alfred Roy " , present on Charmbracelet , Carey refers to a moment she shared with him on his death @-@ bed . Critics described the song as " the album 's most lyrically personal song " and appreciated its simple piano accompaniment , while Carey retells of a visit she shared with her father in his hospital room , " Strange to feel that proud , strong man / Grip tightly to my hand . " 
 After the release of Charmbracelet and its succeeding album , The Emancipation of Mimi ( 2005 ) , Carey began working on material for her eleventh studio effort , the yet untitled E = MC ² ( 2008 ) . It was one of the most anticipated albums of 2008 , with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success , following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi . " Bye Bye " was released as the album 's second single , following " Touch My Body " , and premiered on radio on April 7 , 2008 , and became available to download at iTunes on April 15 , 2008 . The single officially went for adds on April 22 , 2008 on Mainstream and Rhythm / Crossover stations . Carey recalled in an interview with MTV : 
 " Sometimes when I 'm writing a song , it does come from such a raw place that I 'm actually crying while writing it , " Mariah admitted . Her second single , a tribute to her late father , is also meant to reach anyone else who has suffered a loss of a loved one . " Sometimes I hear it and feel that this is going to touch a lot of people , and that 's why it 's important that no matter what 's ever happened to me over my career , that I stay the course and continue to write and try and reach people who need . " Anyone who manages to do the reverse , and touch Mariah with one of their songs , " I 'm indebted to them forever . "

 " Bye Bye " is a slow @-@ tempo " inspirational power ballad " , which is influenced by R & B and pop music genres .

According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , " Bye Bye " is set in common time with a tempo of 68 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of B @-@ flat major , with Carey 's vocal range spanning from the low @-@ note of F3 to the high @-@ note of F6 in whistle register , and F5 in chest voice . The song follows in the chord progression of Bm7 – Am7 – Gmaj7 . 
 Lyrically , the song was described by critics as a " larger than life anthem " , and an " inspirational lighter @-@ in @-@ the @-@ air ballad " , where Carey remembers both her father , as well as any lost loved ones . " Bye Bye " begins with an understated chorus , then working into the first verse , in which Carey retells her childhood , and her relationship with her father years ago : " As a child there were them times / I didn 't get it , but you kept me alive / I didn 't know why you didn 't show up sometimes / And its more than saying ' I miss you ' / But I 'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it , you never let it show " . Then , the pre @-@ chorus continues describing Carey 's emotions in the present , " And everyday life goes on / I wish I could talk to you for a while " , and how the loss of her father still affects her day @-@ to @-@ day life . 
 While the verses are dedicated to him , the chorus was written in a third @-@ person point of view , for her fans : " This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend , your baby , your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas , daddies , sisters , brothers , friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won 't ever say bye bye " . As Carey sings the second chorus , she reverts to the singular conversation with her deceased father , however now revisiting 2005 , " And you never got a chance to see how good I 've done / And you never got to see me back at No. 1 " , referencing her return to the top of music with The Emancipation of Mimi . The song does not feature a bridge , instead repeating the chorus twice , once in the same key as the rest of the song , while the other in a raised octave . During the last chorus , Carey 's voice is doubled , with her regular tone voice singing softly over the piano chords , while her more prominent and higher pitched vocals are laid over it .

 " Bye Bye " received mostly positive reviews from music critics , and was heavily speculated to have become Carey 's 19th number @-@ one single on the Billboard Hot 100 . Many reviewers complimented its simple and understated musical arrangement and personalized lyrics , while some felt the song was too simple for an artist of Carey 's stature . Jeffrey Mitchell from The Hollywood Reporter described it as a " high point " on the album , and wrote " Mariah softly and sweetly lamenting the loss of any kind of loved one on the truly touching ' Bye Bye ' . Mitchell concluded his review put stock in the song 's success , and ended with " Thankfully , it looks like we won ’ t be saying “ bye ” to Mariah for a long time . " An anonymous journalist writing in for MTV UK called " Bye Bye " a " tear jerking ode to people who have passed away " , and assumed it would " have reality pop contestants singing away for decades to come !

The song received positive response from both Rolling Stone 's Christian Hoard and Yahoo ! Music writer Dann Gennoe , who describes the track as a " piano @-@ based big @-@ voiced " and " lighter @-@ friendly " ballad . In his review of E = MC ² , a writer from the Los Angeles Times described the song 's lyrics and production in detail : 
 When Carey tries to open up a bit more , her sentiments are the equivalent of a Hallmark Precious Moments figurine . In a ballad ' Bye Bye ' , Carey isn 't taking chances , designing the lyrics for mass appeal by dedicating them to anyone who ever lost somebody , be it ' your best friend , your baby , your man or your lady ' . But Carey gracefully pulls off the universality of the lyrics , and the tune will likely be a massive hit . 
 A columnist from the British newspaper New ! described " Bye Bye " as their " favorite track " and wrote , " the delicious ' Bye Bye ' is a classic slushy Mariah ballad , with a <unk> chorus . " Jonathan Reyes from Rap @-@ Up felt the track would get listeners " teary eyed " , and due to it being a " song everyone can relate too " , assure it would become Carey 's next number @-@ one single . While ABC News writer , Steve Jones , described how " Bye Bye " packed the bum with " an emotional wallop " , The Washington Post 's Freedom De Luc compared it heavily to " Don 't Forget About Us " , Carey 's 2005 single . De Luc wrote how both shared similar piano instrumentation , however different lyrical settings ; " Don 't Forget About Us " finds Carey playing a " broken @-@ hearted lover " , while " Bye Bye " an " inspirational song that comes with its own set of suggested demographics and instructions . " Some reviewers felt the song was a sub @-@ par effort from an artist of Carey 's stature , with many describing it as unoriginal and not a good follow @-@ up single to " Touch My Body " . Entertainment Weekly 's Margeaux <unk> felt " Bye Bye " was an " odd choice " for a second single , and called it " somber edgy " . Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as a " <unk> ballad " , while an anonymous VH1 critic wrote " with the “ We Belong Together ” sonic template and lyrics tailored appeal to everyone on such a basic level seems like too easy of a combination for someone as established as Mimi . This one ’ s like insurance – in case nothing else is a hit , here ’ s a sure @-@ shot . But ultimately , it turns out that the album is too good for that . "

 The music video was directed by Justin Francis , and co @-@ directed by Nick Cannon on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas . The video became notable for the pair , due to the fact that it was during its conception and recording that they began dating , and eventually wed two months later . The video was shot in early April 2008 , but was delayed until May , with several critics suggesting it because of the couples engagement . In an interview with Fox News , Cannon spoke of his feelings when first speaking with Carey regarding the video : " From the first time we sat down to discuss the video at the Beverly Hills Hotel , we connected . We had so much in common spiritually , and we laugh at the same things . I didn 't have to put on my Mac Daddy suave mode . I was able to be myself with her . We are both eternally 12 years old . " The pair eloped in the Bahamas , at Carey 's private estate in Eleuthera , and wed on April 30 , 2008 . The couple stayed on the island for over two weeks after the nuptials for their honeymoon , which is why the video was delayed until mid @-@ May , so Carey would be able to promote it in time .

This is shown along with various behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage of Carey at various promotional events in the United Kingdom . The video begins with grainy footage of a plane landing in the Bahamas , with Carey and Cannon exiting the aircraft with her dog . Throughout the video , scenes of Carey laying on a sofa , writing lyrics and tearing , as well as the singer in a darkened stage are shown . Several behind @-@ the @-@ scenes clips of Carey promoting the album in the United Kingdom are shown , as she arrives at a CD signing , and connects with fans . Following the signing , Carey is shown at a fashion show , as well as modelling in several outfits . Other scenes that intermingle are of Carey looking out of her hotel suite window in London , as well as candles being put out . During the second verse , the couple is seen spending time together on the island , spending time with friends at a small gathering at the pool , as well as moments of Carey modeling for her bikini photo shoot for the June issue of Vibe . The video 's final segment is of Carey performing the song at a concert in a large theatre , while several photos are sporadically shown . Photographs of several of Carey 's deceased friends and family members are shown , including her dog , Jack , her father Alfred Roy , her grandmother , David Cole , Luciano Pavarotti , Ol ' Dirty Bastard , and Luther Vandross , all of whom Carey had collaborated with during her career . Critics complimented the inclusion of the photos with both Pavarotti and Vandross , and considered it Carey 's way of honoring them . The music video peaked at # 4 on Billboard 's Hot Videoclip Tracks chart .

 On the seventh season of the popular talent competition American Idol , Carey was featured as a mentor for the top @-@ seven week . Titled " Mariah Carey Week " and airing live on April 14 , 2008 , the contestants were to perform a song from Carey 's catalog . After all seven contestants sang their individual songs , they all came together for a live rendition of Carey 's 1996 collaboration with Boyz II Men , " One Sweet Day " . Overall , critics noted how a Carey themed week would be extremely difficult for the performers , due to their vocally strenuous nature . Following their joint performance , Carey emerged onto the stage in a black mini @-@ dress , and performed " Bye Bye " live , while backed by a trio of supporting vocalists . Tamara Jones of The Washington Post jokingly commented on Carey 's flailing hand movements during the performance , writing how she was " waving like a malevolent homecoming queen " . Gil Kaufman from MTV News complimented Carey 's performance , commenting on her " barely there micro @-@ dress " and writing how she " serenaded the audience with her homage to lost ones . " The Calgary Sun 's Lindsey Ward described it as a " less @-@ than @-@ fab performance " , although complimenting on Carey 's leaner figure , " Oh , who am I kidding ? She would look hot in a paper bag . " 
 On April 25 , 2008 , Carey opened the Good Morning America " Summer Concert Series " with a live performance in Times Square . Carey , wearing a pink mini @-@ skirt , began the set with " Touch My Body " in front of thousands of fans . During the song , Carey 's backing vocals began to malfunction , causing it to repeat phrases and play during her main vocal moments . In order to let the sound engineer know of the problem , she substituted part of the lyrics for " stop singing my part now baby " , and completed the final chorus . She continued on with " I 'm That Chick " , and completed the three @-@ song set @-@ list with her follow @-@ up single , " Bye Bye " . After marking the album 's stateside launch with her appearance on Good Morning America , Carey took to Europe to perform on several programs , one of which included a live rendition of " Bye Bye " . She began with an interview on the British radio station , BBC Radio 1 , and continued onto a live performance of the song on T4 . On April 12 , 2008 , Carey made an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show . Winfrey interviewed the singer on her weight loss , E = MC ² , and even showed footage of Carey in her New York apartment , showing off her lingerie closet . Following the interview , Carey , dressed in a purple and black ensemble , performed a live rendition of " Bye Bye " for the audience , with three background vocalists assisting her . Kevin Johnson from St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch described the performance as " touching " , and complimented the song 's appeal .

 = Cartman 's Mom Is a Dirty Slut = 
 " Cartman 's Mom Is a Dirty Slut " is the first season finale of the American animated television series South Park . It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on February 25 , 1998 . The episode is the highest viewed episode in the entire South Park series , with 6 @.@ 4 million views . It is part one of a two @-@ episode story arc , which concluded with " Cartman 's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut " . The episode follows Eric Cartman , one of the show 's child protagonists , becoming curious about the identity of his father . He discovers that his father is most likely a man his mother had sexual intercourse with during an annual party called " The Drunken Barn Dance " . Meanwhile , his friends Stan , Kyle and Kenny participate on America 's <unk> Home Videos , after filming Cartman playing in his yard with plush toys . 
 The episode was written by Trey Parker and staff writer David A. Goodman , and directed by Parker . It featured a guest appearance by comedian Jay Leno , who provided cat sounds for Cartman 's cat . " Cartman 's Mom is a Dirty Slut " had a cliffhanger ending ; the identity of Cartman 's father was intended to be revealed in the second season premiere , but Parker and co @-@ creator Matt Stone wrote an unrelated April Fool 's Day episode instead . This was much to the dismay of South Park viewers . This episode was met with positive responses from critics . 
 In the summer of 2013 , fans voted " Cartman 's Mom Is a Dirty Slut " as the best episode of season one . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Stan , Kyle and Kenny decide to check on Cartman when he does not show up for school . They discover that he is having a tea party with his stuffed animals in his backyard . Their school counselor Mr. Mackey advises them to videotape Cartman , so he can study him psychologically . 
 Meanwhile , Cartman does not have a father to take to the annual father @-@ and @-@ son dance and asks his mother who he is . His mother explains that she met his father , a Native American named Chief Running Water , at the 12th annual " Drunken Barn Dance " . However , Chief Running Water informs him that his mother dumped him for Chef . Chef tells Cartman that his mother preferred Mr. Garrison over him . Mr. Garrison admits that he had slept with Mrs. Cartman , but then argues " But who here didn 't ! ? " , to which Mayor McDaniels , Principal Victoria , Jesus and Father Maxi share guilty glances with each other . Dr. Mephisto is willing to perform DNA testing to resolve the issue , but requires $ 3 @,@ 000 for the test . Cartman gets depressed , as he does not have the money . 
 In the meantime , Kyle , Stan and Kenny watch America 's <unk> Home Videos ; they hear there 's a $ 10 @,@ 000 grand prize for the stupidest home video . They decide to enter the competition with the video they made of Cartman . Cartman approaches Kyle and Stan ( Kenny was dragged to a train track by Stan 's go @-@ cart and killed by an oncoming train ) with the depressing news about his lack of funds to find out his real father . Stan and Kyle agree that if they win the video contest they will give Cartman the $ 3 @,@ 000 needed for the DNA testing . Cartman is overjoyed , but quickly becomes extremely angry after seeing the aired video . Though they do not win the competition , as Stan 's grandfather wins with a videotape he made of Kenny 's death , they receive a $ 3 @,@ 000 runner @-@ up prize instead , which is still enough for the DNA test . Dr. Mephesto calls together Cartman , his mother and all potential fathers ( including the 1989 Denver Broncos ) , when he gets the test results which is where Kenny comes back to life . When he is about to reveal the identity of Cartman 's father , a narrator states that the answer will be revealed in the new South Park episode four weeks later , much to Cartman 's annoyance and anger .

 " Cartman 's Mom is a Dirty Slut " was written by South Park co @-@ creator Trey Parker and staff writer David R. Goodman , and directed by Parker . South Park would sometimes have guest appearances by celebrities , but they would usually voice a supporting or minor character ; Academy Award winning actor George Clooney had previously provided dog barks for the episode " Big Gay Al 's Big Gay Boat Ride " . Comedian and talk @-@ show host Jay Leno provided the sounds of Cartman 's cat Mr. Kitty in the episode . Leno would return later as himself in the season two episode " City on the Edge of Forever " . Toddy Walters provided the vocals for the song used at " The Drunken Barn Dance " ( which is a parody of " My Heart Will Go On " ) . Walters was romantically involved with Parker at the time the episode was being produced . She would continue to write and sing for the show throughout its third season . 
 The episode was to conclude with the first episode of the second season , on April 1 , 1998 , four weeks after " Cartman 's Mom is a Dirty Slut " was first broadcast . However , instead of continuing the episode 's storyline , Parker and co @-@ creator Matt Stone made an episode regarding the South Park minor characters Terrance and Philip , as an April Fool 's Day prank on viewers of the show . Upset fans wrote more than 2 @,@ 000 angry e @-@ mail complaints to Comedy Central within a week of the episode 's original broadcast , and media outlets said some fans harbored a grudge against the show more than five years after the episode was broadcast . 
 = = Theme = = 
 Writing for Newsday , television critic Tom Carson stated he felt the episode was " a really plaintive story about craving something , anything , to hold onto " , as Cartman tries to adapt the culture of each man he believes to be his father . Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock , author of the book Taking South Park Seriously , also felt the episode was a good example of a " kind of equivalency between ethnic , racial and sexual identities " , but felt " the humor lies partly in Cartman 's parody of mass culture 's stereotypes of Native Americans and African Americans " . In his book American politics and society today , Robert Singh noted that the episode gives the most prominent example of how Cartman 's rude behaviour is the result of being raised without a father . This correlated with a theory by Paul Cantor , author of the book The Simpsons : <unk> Politics and the Nuclear Family , regarding Homer Simpson , of FOX 's The Simpsons , " that merely by being present , a dutiful and attached father can provide a meaningful influence , despite his dysfunctional behaviour and errant educational ways .

 When first broadcast in the United States , " Cartman 's Mom is a Dirty Slut " gained positive responses from critics . Writing for The Vancouver Sun , Brian Lowry and Alex Strachan defined " Cartman 's Mom is a Dirty Slut " , as well as " Damien " , " Mecha Streisand " and " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " , as season one 's " classic episodes " , commenting that " Cartman 's Mom is a Dirty Slut " was " a heart @-@ warming , tender episode " . Carson also praised the episode for its " hilarious sex @-@ jokes " . In a top ten list of South Park 's best episodes , compiled by Chicago Tribune reporter Allan Johnson , " Cartman 's Mom is a Dirty Slut " was ranked third , behind " Osama bin Laden Has <unk> Pants " and " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " . 
 On April 27 , 1999 , " Cartman 's Mom is a Dirty Slut " was released on the " South Park : Volume 7 " VHS tape which also contained " Cartman 's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut " , in a third series of South Park home video releases . Volume 7 was sold along with Volume 8 , which contained " Chickenlover " and " Ike 's Wee Wee " , and Volume 9 , which contained " <unk> Fetus Lady " and " The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka " . All thirteen episodes of the first season , including " Cartman 's Mom is a Dirty Slut " , were released on a DVD box set on November 12 , 2002 . Parker and Stone recorded commentary tracks for each episode , but the tracks were not included on the DVDs due to " standards " issues with some of the statements ; refusing to allow the tracks to be censored or edited , Parker and Stone 's commentary tracks were released on a separate CD . 
 = Bacon : A Love Story = 
 Bacon : A Love Story , A Salty Survey of Everybody 's Favorite Meat is a 2009 non @-@ fiction book about <unk> by American writer Heather Lauer . Lauer started the blog Bacon Unwrapped and a social networking site about bacon in 2005 , after the idea came to her while she was out drinking with her two brothers ; her online success inspired her to write the book , which describes curing and cooking bacon , gives over 20 bacon recipes , and analyzes the impact of bacon on popular culture . The text is interspersed with facts about bacon and bacon @-@ related quips from comedian Jim Gaffigan . 
 The book had a generally positive reception ; The Sacramento Bee called it " entertaining and informational " . The Toronto Star and The Sacramento Bee recommended it as a Father 's Day gift . The Portsmouth Herald and The Arizona Republic highlighted the book on lists of summer reading recommendations . Publishers Weekly wrote that bacon lovers would enjoy the book , but other readers may not so much . 
 = = Content summary = = 
 Bacon : A Love Story contains information on cooking and curing bacon , including " time @-@ honored methods and traditions " . The book analyzes how bacon has affected popular culture . Lauer includes information on chefs who love of bacon and venues that serve the product throughout the United States . The book contains over 20 recipes for dishes made with bacon , including Bacon Bloody Mary , Bacon @-@ Wrapped Tater Tots , Bacon Bleu Salad , and bacon brownies . Another recipe is Bristol Bacon by chef Duncan Bristol , who owns the restaurant Brick 29 in Nampa , Idaho . Interspersed throughout the book are bits about bacon from comedian Jim Gaffigan , and random information such as that " Cracker Barrel serves 124 million slices of bacon per year " . Lauer notes , " Speck is the direct German translation of the word ' bacon ' " , and observes that the word " creates cross @-@ cultural confusion " . The book 's " Bacon 411 " section provides further information on the product .

 Before the book 's publication , Heather Lauer was a public affairs consultant in Arizona . She hatched the idea to write a book about bacon after going out for cocktails with her two brothers in 2005 . Lauer explained to The Arizona Republic : " I was out drinking with my brothers one night , and the topic of bacon came up . We had eaten bacon as kids , and bacon was a special thing on Sunday mornings . Somehow , the idea came up about how funny it would be to start a blog about bacon ... I took it and ran with it . " She began the blog Bacon Unwrapped , at <unk> , and a social networking site about bacon at <unk> in 2005 . 
 Lauer thought that the surge in interest in bacon products prior to the book 's publication was " media driven " . She noted that a response to political correctness as related to cooking and food consumption may have driven interest in the product . Lauer said that bacon seems to be " the one thing that people are unwilling to give up " . In a post of her blog in March 2009 , Lauer lamented those that were willing to posit an end to the trend of interest in bacon . She commented , " Bacon is something that everybody is familiar with and most people grew up eating . It has a comfort aspect to it and a familiarity . It 's also got an addictive aspect to it — that sweet and salty combination of flavors . " She asserted that interest in the product is as much due to the culture surrounding it as to bacon itself . " Current food trends focus on eating real and eating local , and there 's nothing more real than a delicious strip of bacon . In many U.S. cities , local producers and chefs are making a name for themselves because of bacon , " said Lauer . She stated that " most chefs would admit that bacon has long been one of their secret weapons in the kitchen . " The book was marketed as the " most comprehensive book about bacon to date " . Lauer promoted her book in a September 2009 appearance as a co @-@ host at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Tour in Pennsylvania , hosted by fellow bacon blogger Jason Mosley ( Mr. <unk> , at <unk> ) .

 Writing for The Sacramento Bee , Allen Pierleoni recommended the book as a gift for Father 's Day , and called the work " entertaining and informational , full of anecdotes , history , recipes and explanations of what pork belly has brought to the popular culture " . Rita <unk> of the Toronto Star also recommended the book as a Father 's Day gift . Kerry J. Byrne noted that the book covers " everything from bacon @-@ curing methods to bacon blogs " and includes " easy recipes " . Publishers Weekly reviewed called the book a " voluminous look at all things bacon " ; the review concluded , " Readers who , like Lauer , possess a borderline @-@ obsessive love for bacon are likely to embrace this as their new Bible , but anyone else will quickly get their fill . " Rachel Forrest of The Portsmouth Herald recommended the book in her " Annual Summer Reading List for <unk> " . " Another of my favorites this year is ' Bacon : A Love Story : A Salty Survey of Everybody 's Favorite Meat ' by Heather Lauer . A book all about bacon ... she profiles chefs that use it , odd finds across the nation and plenty of recipes , " commented Forrest . The Arizona Republic highlighted the book among its selection of " Books to help turn pages of summer " . 
 = Battle off Endau = 
 The Battle off Endau was a Second World War battle that took place off Endau on 26 – 27 January 1942 . Part of the Battle of Malaya , it was the first notable naval engagement since the sinking of the battleship Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser Repulse on 10 December 1941 , and the last effort by the Royal Navy to intercept Japanese convoy shipping around the Malay Peninsula . 
 A Japanese convoy approaching Endau was detected by reconnaissance aircraft on 26 January and was ineffectually attacked multiple times by Allied aircraft as it was landing its troops . The Allies suffered heavy casualties , while the Japanese lost only a single aircraft . The Royal Navy committed two destroyers later that day to break up the Japanese landings , despite the much larger Japanese escort force . Sailing under the cover of darkness , they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected , but could not find the troopships in the darkness . The ships attempted to disengage , but were fired upon by the convoy 's escorts and one destroyer was sunk in the early morning hours of 27 January . 
 = = Background = = 
 The sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse in the opening stages of the Malayan Campaign left the task of intercepting Japanese convoys in the Gulf of Siam to the submarines of the Royal Netherlands Navy as the surface ships were occupied escorting Allied convoys to and from Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies . The Dutch recorded their first success when the troopship <unk> Maru was sunk off Kota Bharu on 12 December 1941 , probably by HNLMS K XII . On 24 December , HNLMS K XVI sank the destroyer <unk> off the coast of Kuching , Borneo . Several other vessels were also damaged or sunk during the early weeks , but losses were high for the Dutch submarines and they could do little to stem the Japanese advance . 
 = = Endau = = 
 An amphibious landing at Mersing was originally planned by the Japanese to sever the lines of communication between the British forces and Singapore , but the Southern Expeditionary Army Group decided to land the rest of the 18th Division at Singora instead , believing that the Allied defences at Mersing were too formidable . Although ground forces captured Endau on 21 January , they lacked the strength to break through the Australian defences at Sungei @-@ Mersing . 
 On 20 January 1942 , a convoy of eleven troopships departed Cam Ranh Bay , Indochina , to unload ground forces at Singora , of which two would proceed to Endau . The two transports , Kansai Maru and Canberra Maru , were carrying troops of the 96th Airfield Battalion , assigned to bring the airfields of <unk> and Kluang into operation . They were escorted by the 1st Escort Unit , which was formed around Torpedo Squadron 3 , which consisted of the light cruiser Sendai , flagship of Rear @-@ Admiral Shintarō Hashimoto , and six Fubuki @-@ class destroyers , Fubuki , Hatsuyuki , Shirayuki , Asagiri , Amagiri , and <unk> . The squadron was augmented with the five W @-@ 1 @-@ class minesweepers of the 1st Minesweeper Division , three CH @-@ 4 @-@ class submarine chasers of the 11th Submarine Chaser Division , and four converted patrol boats . 
 = = = Air attacks = = = 
 Malaya Command anticipated that the Japanese force would soon be reinforced by a naval convoy , a suspicion confirmed on 26 January when two Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) Lockheed Hudson aircraft sighted them 20 miles ( 32 km ) north of Endau . Although they spotted the Japanese convoy at 07 : 45 , their radio transmissions were jammed , and news did not reach higher command until they landed in Singapore at 09 : 20 . The RAF decided to attack the convoy with all available aircraft . The attack had to be delayed until that afternoon , however , to allow the crews of the Vickers Vildebeest and Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers of No. 36 Squadron RAF and No. 100 Squadron RAF to rest after their night missions . The decision to use the elderly Vildebeest biplanes against the ships in daylight came as a shock to the pilots , who had been restricted to the relative safety of night sorties following the first day of the invasion . 
 The first air attack was carried out by the Vildebeests of Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons and the Hudsons of Nos. 1 and 8 Squadron RAAF . Twelve Vildebeests and nine Hudson bombers took off from Singapore in the early afternoon of January 26 , with a fighter escort composed of twelve Brewster F2A Buffalos and nine Hawker Hurricanes . The Japanese landings on Endau had been in progress for over four hours by the time the planes arrived at 15 : 00 . The Japanese naval force had air cover consisting of 19 Nakajima Ki @-@ 27s from the 1st and 11th Squadrons and a single Nakajima Ki @-@ 44 fighter . Despite heavy opposition , the two transports were bombed , and men and equipment on the beach were strafed . Five Vildebeests were lost in the attack , including the commanding officer of No. 100 Squadron , while one Ki @-@ 27 was shot down . 
 A second wave set off from Singapore at 16 : 15 , consisting of seven Vildebeests and three Albacores of No. 36 Squadron and two Vildebeests of No. 100 Squadron . They arrived over Endau at 17 : 30 , but their escort of seven Hurricanes and four Buffalos were late and the British biplanes were set upon by ten Ki @-@ 27s and two Ki @-@ <unk> before their escorts could reach them . Five Vildebeests , two Albacores and one Hurricane were lost from this wave . Of the 72 aircrew from Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons who participated in the raids , 27 were killed , seven were wounded and two were captured . The returning pilots were congratulated by Air Vice @-@ Marshal Paul Maltby , who promised them that further daylight attacks were unnecessary . 
 A third raid , consisting of six unescorted Hudsons of No. 62 Squadron RAF , flying from Palembang , Sumatra , attacked shortly afterwards , losing two of their number , with their entire crews , to six Ki @-@ 27s . A fourth raid , made up of five Bristol Blenheims of No. 27 Squadron RAF , set off from Palembang later in the day , but had only got as far as Singapore by sunset , so aborted the mission . Despite claims to have scored multiple hits on both transports and a cruiser , neither the transports , nor any of their escorts were damaged ; the former were hit by splinters that killed 8 and wounded 18 , but Sendai and the smaller ships were untouched . 
 = = = Naval battle = = = 
 Rear @-@ Admiral Ernest Spooner , commander of naval forces at Singapore , ordered his only combat @-@ ready warships , the elderly destroyers HMS Thanet and HMAS Vampire , to attack the shipping off Endau later that night . Commander William Moran was captain of Vampire while Thanet was under the command of Lieutenant Commander Bernard Davies . The destroyers departed Singapore at 16 : 30 with Moran in charge of the two ships and headed north . Initial intelligence reports assessed the Japanese strength defending the convoy as a dozen destroyers , but this was revised downward to a pair of destroyers at 22 : 55 , based on inaccurate reporting by surviving RAF aircrew . The 1st Escort Unit was prepared for a surface attack based on an incorrect intelligence report that two British light cruisers were at sea and Hashimoto oriented his ships ' patrol sectors to the north . 
 Moran led his ships between the <unk> Archipelago and the coast of Johor in brilliant moonlight and then altered course northeast to search the area north of the archipelago . When dark clouds obscured the moon at 01 : 51 , he turned southwestwards at a speed of 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) for Endau , keeping <unk> Island behind him to ensure that his ships were not silhouetted against the horizon . At 02 : 37 , Vampire saw a Japanese destroyer ( probably Amagiri ) , but was not spotted in return and the Allied ships continued on their course . Three minutes later , they located another Japanese ship ( the minesweeper W @-@ 4 ) dead ahead at point @-@ blank range . Moran decided to attack , as discovery was inevitable at such short range , and increased his speed to 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) , simultaneously firing two of his three torpedoes at a distance of 600 metres ( 660 yd ) . One torpedo missed ahead by 15 – 20 yards ( 14 – 18 m ) and the other passed underneath the minesweeper . W @-@ 4 , in the middle patrol zone , was trying to identify the two destroyers when Moran attacked , but failed to alert any other Japanese ships to the Allied presence in their midst for 20 minutes before giving a location six nautical miles ( 11 km ; 6 @.@ 9 mi ) away . W @-@ 4 did not return fire and Moran resumed his search for the transports , reducing his speed again to 15 knots to reduce the visibility of his wakes . A half @-@ hour later , with shallow water approaching , and no transports spotted , the Allied destroyers altered course to the north to clear the shallows and increased speed to 25 knots at 03 : 13 before turning southeast by east . 
 At 03 : 18 , Vampire sighted the destroyer Shirayuki off the port bow and another ship astern . Vampire and Thanet made minor course adjustments to fire their torpedoes at Shirayuki at a range of 1 @,@ 500 yards ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) – one from Vampire and all four of Thanet 's – but all missed as Shirayuki , having spotted the Allied ships at the same time , altered course to come behind the Allied destroyers and then signalled to confirm their identities . Not receiving a reply , the Japanese ship illuminated the Allied ships with her searchlight and finally opened fire at 03 : 31 despite the smoke screen being laid by both ships . Moran ordered both his ships to return fire with their four @-@ inch guns while retiring southeast at maximum speed . Thanet only fired three volleys from her guns before she was hit in the engine room . The hit fractured both the main and auxiliary steam lines to the engines , causing the ship to go dead in the water and lose all electrical power . Constantly making small changes of course to throw off Japanese gun layers , neither ship hit any Japanese ships during the battle . 
 Allied and Japanese accounts of the gunnery action are difficult to reconcile , particularly as neither of the Allied destroyers recorded any times after firing their torpedoes at 03 : 18 . Shirayuki fired 18 rounds at Vampire at a range of 4 @,@ 500 yards ( 4 @,@ 100 m ) before the muzzle blast from her rear gun mounts tripped the circuit breakers in her main electrical switchboard , causing complete electrical failure throughout the ship . While electrical service was restored within two minutes , the ship had a series of smaller electrical failures that bedeviled her for the next 15 minutes . When she resumed firing , Vampire was no longer visible and Shirayuki targeted Thanet instead at a range of 3 @,@ 050 metres ( 10 @,@ 010 ft ) , firing 82 rounds at her . Yugiri opened fire at 03 : 38 at Thanet 4 @,@ 500 yards ( 4 @,@ 100 m ) away and both ships observed their target slowing down at 03 : 45 . At that same time , Yugiri radioed Hashimoto that " The enemy is two destroyers " so she had spotted Vampire as she fled , although Yugiri lost sight of Vampire 10 minutes later . Sendai , Fubuki , Asagiri , Amagiri , Hatsuyuki and W @-@ 1 all subsequently opened fire , mostly at Thanet , although Vampire reported being under fire for a considerable time . All told , the Japanese ships fired 469 rounds at the Allied destroyers , failing to hit Vampire even once . Shirayuki reported that Thanet had sunk at 04 : 18 and rescued an officer and 30 ratings from the water ; another officer and 11 ratings died in the battle . The Japanese did not pursue and Vampire reached Singapore at 10 : 00 that morning . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Shirayuki handed over the rescued seamen to troops on Endau the following day . They were never seen again , but are believed to have been executed in retaliation for losses sustained by the Japanese in an ambush by the Australian 2 / 18th Battalion , which occurred south of Mersing about the same time as the naval action off Endau . Davies , four other officers , and 61 ratings from Thanet managed to reach shore and made their way to Singapore , together with shot down aircrew . 
 The Japanese were able to finish landing their troops , which may have contributed to the impression of significant forces in front of the Australian defenders and their subsequent withdrawal . The heavy losses suffered by the Allied aircraft and aircrew virtually eliminated their ability to influence the subsequent ground battles . Moran 's report on Japanese incompetence at night fighting was the most important result of the battle . Since few details about the subsequent night combats off Java survived , Moran 's assessment influenced Allied thinking about the IJN until the stunning victory during the nighttime Battle of Savo Island in August flipped the Allied beliefs about the Japanese ability at night fighting on their heads . 
 = Ace Bailey Benefit Game = 
 The Ace Bailey Benefit Game was the first all @-@ star game in National Hockey League ( NHL ) history . It was played on February 14 , 1934 at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto to raise money to support Ace Bailey , whose career was ended by a violent hit by Eddie Shore during a game earlier in the 1933 – 34 season . The Toronto Maple Leafs defeated a team made up of the top players from the rest of the league , 7 – 3 , before a crowd of 14 @,@ 074 spectators . 
 The game was held two months following the incident between the Boston Bruins and the Toronto Maple Leafs at the Boston Garden that resulted in Bailey 's injuries . Toronto 's Red Horner dazed Shore with a heavy hit . Intent on revenge , Shore thought he was skating at Horner , but instead knocked Bailey over . Bailey flew through the air , and suffered a fractured skull when he landed on his head . Shore himself was knocked unconscious in the melee that resulted . 
 Though it was initially feared he would not survive his injuries , Bailey recovered enough to participate in the benefit game . He presented gifts and shook the hands of each player as they were introduced . Among them was Eddie Shore himself , who was playing for the NHL all @-@ stars . The crowd fell silent as Shore approached , then erupted into loud cheering when Bailey extended his hand toward his attacker . The Maple Leafs announced during the ceremonies that no player on their team would again wear Bailey 's number 6 , marking the first time in NHL history that a team retired a player 's uniform number .

 The incident between Ace Bailey and Eddie Shore occurred in the Boston Garden during the second period of a regular league game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins on December 12 , 1933 . Having taken two penalties in quick succession , the Maple Leafs were playing short handed , and sent Bailey , Red Horner and King Clancy out to defend against Boston 's power play . During that sequence , Clancy upended Shore with a hard check as the later player rushed up the ice . Angry , dazed , and thinking he was going after Clancy , Shore rushed at Bailey intent on revenge . He hit Bailey hard from the side , sending the stricken player flying through the air . Bailey struck the ice head first and lapsed into convulsions . Furious , Horner asked Shore what he was doing , and when met with only a smile in response , knocked Shore out cold with one punch . 
 Both players were carried off the ice , where Shore first regained consciousness . He was able to reach Bailey , who briefly regained consciousness himself , and attempted to apologize . Bailey was able to respond with " it 's all part of the game " before again passing out . As Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe attempted to reach his team 's dressing room to find out the status of Bailey , he was accosted by angry Bruins fans , one of whom accused Bailey of faking his injury . An angry Smythe punched the fan in the mouth , and was later charged with assault . 
 Bailey was rushed to hospital in Boston with a fractured skull where neurosurgeons worked through the night to save his life . His injuries were so severe that doctors gave him only hours to live . Distraught over his son 's injuries , Bailey 's father boarded a train bound for Boston carrying a revolver , telling everyone he met of his intent to kill Shore . When Smythe found out about this , he contacted his assistant general manager , Frank Selke , for help . Selke got in touch with a friend of his who worked in the Boston Police , who met Bailey 's father at a hotel and talked the man out of his plan before returning him to Toronto . 
 Authorities in Boston made it known that they intended to charge Shore with manslaughter if the player died . Bailey held on , though his life hung in the balance for several days . Following several surgeries , doctors eventually found reason to hope Bailey would survive . He amazed observers by showing a steady recovery , and by mid January was well enough to be transferred home to Toronto . 
 The NHL quickly absolved the referees of blame , while Shore protested that he was in a dazed state and not conscious of his actions at the time . League president Frank Calder suspended Horner until January 1 , 1934 , a period of six games , and Shore indefinitely for their roles in the incident . When he was assured that Bailey would survive , Calder set Shore 's suspension at 16 games . Bailey never played another game .

 As Bailey recovered , Ottawa Journal sports editor Walter <unk> proposed in an open letter that a benefit game be held . The Maple Leafs , Montreal Maroons and Ottawa Senators called a meeting of the board of governors to determine who would pay for Bailey 's recovery . Following the meeting , the governors announced that an exhibition would be held in Toronto between the Maple Leafs and a team of the top players from the rest of the league to raise money for Bailey and his family . The all @-@ star team was selected by a three @-@ man committee consisting of league president Calder , New York Rangers owner Frank Patrick and league director Thomas Arnold . 
 For the first all @-@ star game in NHL history , two players were selected from each of the other eight NHL teams , while Rangers coach Lester Patrick was named the coach . For his starting lineup , Patrick chose Charlie Gardiner in goal , Eddie Shore and Ching Johnson on defence , and Howie Morenz , Bill Cook and Aurel Joliat as his forwards . Patrick expressed confidence that the fans in Toronto would welcome Shore 's participation . 
 The game was held on February 14 , 1934 , and featured a lavish pre @-@ game ceremony that first saw the players assemble at centre ice to have photographs taken in their regular sweaters . They were then presented with their all @-@ star jerseys by Frank Calder , Lester Patrick , Leaf officials and Ace Bailey himself . Gardiner stepped out first to receive his number 1 uniform , and was then followed by Shore , who wore number 2 . The crowd of over 14 @,@ 000 fans went completely silent as Shore slowly skated toward Bailey . After a moment , Bailey extended his hand towards Shore , and the crowd erupted in loud cheering as the two shook hands . 
 The players were presented with medals and <unk> by officials of the Canadiens and the Maple Leafs , and the fans cheered each player as they were introduced , even those who were previously unpopular with the Toronto crowd . The ceremony concluded with Conn Smythe presenting Bailey with his own sweater , and announcing to the crowd that no Leafs player would again wear Bailey 's number 6 . It marked the first time in NHL history that a team retired a player 's uniform number .

 Bailey stepped out to ice to drop the puck for the ceremonial face off , after which the game began . The Leafs ' Charlie Conacher , who had been questionable before the game with an already infected knee , was forced to leave the game after being hit early , but otherwise the match @-@ up was a considerable departure from a regular league game and featured little physical play . Shore , who was visibly nervous before the game about the reception he would receive from the crowd , was cheered and supported when he rushed with the puck . The first goal was scored by Toronto 's Baldy Cotton , and was quickly followed up with a goal by Harvey Jackson to put Toronto up 2 – 0 before Nels Stewart rounded out the offence in the first period with a goal for the All @-@ Stars . 
 After Toronto took a 3 – 1 lead early in the second , Morenz scored the most impressive goal on the night , accepting a pass from Joliat at full speed as he raced around a Maple Leafs defenceman before shooting the puck over goaltender George Hainsworth 's shoulder . Frank Finnigan brought the All @-@ Stars even at the midway point of the period , but Toronto ended the period with a 4 – 3 lead after the referees mistakenly ruled a Hap Day shot that hit the post as a goal . 
 Though the All @-@ Stars took many shots on Hainsworth in the third period , they were unable to score . Busher Jackson scored to put the Maple Leafs up by two early in the period , and after Patrick abandoned any attempt at defence by placing five forwards on the ice in a bid to tie the game , Toronto added two late goals to emerge with a 7 – 3 victory .

 The proceeds from the game totaled $ 20 @,@ 909 , which was given to Bailey . Additionally , he was presented with $ 6 @,@ 000 raised by the Bruins in a separate benefit . Prior to the game , Bailey presented Calder with a trophy commissioned by the Maple Leafs and bearing his name that the team hoped would go to the winner of an annual all @-@ star game that would benefit injured players . That failed to materialize , though the NHL held two additional benefit games in the following five years . Memorial games were held for the families of Howie Morenz in 1937 and Babe Siebert in 1939 . It was not until 1947 that the idea became an annual event when the 1st National Hockey League All @-@ Star Game was held in Toronto . 
 Though Bailey never played again , he remained in the Maple Leafs organization for nearly a half century , working as a penalty box official for the team . He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1975 . Shore remained an NHL regular until 1940 then operated a minor league hockey team . He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1947 .

 = Mulan ( Disney character ) = 
 Fa Mulan , a character inspired by an actual historic figure , is a character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures ' 36th animated feature film Mulan ( 1998 ) , as well as its sequel Mulan II ( 2004 ) . Her speaking voice is provided by Chinese @-@ American actress Ming @-@ Na Wen , while Filipina singer Lea Salonga provides the character 's singing voice . Created by author Robert D. San Souci , Mulan is based on the legendary Chinese warrior Hua Mulan from the poem the Ballad of Mulan . The only child of an aging war veteran , Mulan disregards both tradition and the law by disguising herself as a man in order to enlist herself in the army in lieu of her feeble father . 
 Disney had originally conceived Mulan as an oppressed young Chinese woman who ultimately elopes to Europe to be with a British prince . However , director Tony Bancroft , who was inspired by the well @-@ being of his own daughters , wanted Mulan to be a different , unique kind of Disney heroine – one who is strong and independent , whose fate does not depend upon a male character . Thus , the relationship between Mulan and Captain Li Shang was relegated to that of a minor subplot , while Mulan 's bravery and strength were emphasized in order to ensure that she remained the hero of her own story . Mulan 's supervising animator was Mark Henn , who deliberately designed the character so that she would appear less feminine than her predecessors . 
 Reception towards Mulan 's personality has been generally positive , with critics praising her bravery and heroism . However , some commentators have accused Disney of Westernizing the character , while her romantic relationship with Shang has been widely accused of compromising Mulan 's heroism . Chronologically , Mulan is the eighth Disney Princess , and the franchise 's first East Asian member . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Conception and writing = = = 
 Mulan was originally conceived as an animated short in 1994 , in which the heroine is depicted as a miserable Chinese girl who elopes to the West to be with a British prince . While developing a series of treatments based on traditional stories and folk tales , children 's book author Robert D. San Souci discovered the Ballad of Mulan , an ancient Chinese poem about Hua Mulan – a Chinese woman who replaces her ailing father in the army by disguising herself as a man . Fascinated by Hua Mulan 's story , San Souci suggested the poem to Disney ; the studio hired San Souci himself to write the film 's treatment and story . 
 Mulan explores the age @-@ old theme of remaining true to oneself , with co @-@ director Tony Bancroft summarizing the character 's role in the film as " the story of a girl who can 't help who she is but she exists in a different society that tells her who she is supposed to be . " Because the Ballad of Mulan is such a beloved and well @-@ known story , San Souci longed to maintain the character 's integrity . However , certain creative liberties were taken with the story in regards to Mulan 's role , such as the character neglecting to ask her parents ' permission prior to enlisting herself in the army . Additionally , Mulan 's surname was changed from " Hua " to " Fa . " Finally , Mulan 's true identity is discovered much earlier in the film , soon after the army 's initial encounter with the enemy , whereas her comrades remain ignorant throughout their entire 12 years at war until after Mulan has returned home . 
 In addition , unlike preceding traditional Disney animated feature films , the developing romantic relationship between Mulan and Li Shang is treated as more of a subplot as opposed to a traditional central plot , as observed by film critic Andy Klein of Animation World Network . Klein commented , " Mulan isn 't waiting for her prince to someday come ; when he does arrive , having known her primarily as a man , and having learned to admire her for her deeper qualities , the romance is muted and subtle . " Throughout the movie they are constantly working towards helping each other change into better and truer versions of themselves in order to achieve their true potential . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 Mulan 's speaking voice is provided by Chinese @-@ American actress Ming @-@ Na Wen . Because the character " represented [ traditional ] Chinese values " and is depicted as being " dramatic ... close to her father , very respectful , " Bancroft believed that Wen possessed the " perfect " voice for Mulan , which he additionally described as " very Chinese . " Born and raised in Macau , China , Wen was very much familiar with both the legend of Hua Mulan and the Ballad of Mulan at the time of her audition for the role , having grown up being read the poem by her mother . Wen explained , " I think every Chinese kid grows up with this story , " additionally likening the poem 's popularity in China to that of the Western Parson Weems fable in which American president George Washington chops down his father 's beloved cherry tree . 
 Mulan served as Wen 's first voice @-@ acting role . In an interview with IGN , the actress elaborated on the recording process , specifically the fact that she was required to record the majority of the character 's dialogue in isolation , saying , " I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was easy for me . I loved using my imagination . I felt like I was a little kid again , being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon . So it was a lot of fun for me . " In spite of the fact that , throughout the film , Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian , a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy , Wen and her co @-@ star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations . 
 Upon being cast as Mulan 's speaking voice , Wen was immediately informed by Disney that she would not be providing the character 's singing voice . The actress took no offense to this decision , commenting jokingly " I don 't blame them . " The directors hired Filipina singer and actress Lea Salonga to dub the character 's respective singing voice , heard in the film 's songs " Reflection " , " I 'll Make a Man Out of You " and " A Girl Worth Fighting For " , on Wen 's behalf . According to Thomas S. Hischak , author of the book Disney Voice Actors : A Biographical Dictionary , Salonga was originally cast to provide both Mulan 's speaking and singing voices . However , the directors eventually felt that her attempt at impersonating a man in the form of Mulan 's male alter @-@ ego " Ping " was rather unconvincing , and ultimately replacing Salonga with Wen . Six years prior to Mulan , Salonga provided the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Disney 's Aladdin ( 1992 ) on behalf of American actress Linda Larkin . While auditioning for Mulan , Salonga asked jokingly , " Why do I have to audition ? ... I was already a princess before . Wasn 't that enough ? " 
 = = = Characterization and design = = = 
 The film 's screenplay was constantly being revised and re @-@ written . Naturally , so was Mulan 's characterization and role in the film . The writers wanted Mulan to represent a " different kind of Disney heroine , " specifically described as one who " didn 't need a tiara , but was still just as much as graceful , strong , and courageous . " Between the two , Bancroft and his twin brother Tom , an animator who also worked on Mulan , have a total of seven daughters . This further inspired the filmmakers to portray Mulan as a unique heroine who is " not another damsel in distress " in favor of having her resemble " a strong female Disney character who would truly be the heroine of her own story " instead , essentially a " female role model . The characteristics of strength and courage were a must for Mulan . " In an interview with The Christian Post , Bancroft elaborated on the way in which he , as the film 's director , continued to consider the well @-@ being of his two young daughters while working on Mulan , having " wanted to make ... a unique heroine that hadn 't been seen before " and provide for them " someone who would be strong on her own , without a prince saving her . " Addressing the way in which Mulan differs from traditional Disney heroines and princesses , Bancroft explained , " Most Disney heroines have an outside source that comes in and helps them change . Mulan stays consistent . From the first frame all the way through the end of the movie , her personality , her drive it all stays the same . " 
 Visually , the animators were influenced by both traditional Chinese and Japanese artwork . In the specific case of Mulan , " The characters ' simple lines ... resemble classic Asian painting " , as demonstrated by the animators ' innovate " ' less is more ' approach " to traditional animation . Chinese artist Chen Yi mentored the animators , " helping [ them ] to come up with these designs . " Mark Henn served as Mulan 's supervising animator . Animating the character in her male disguise as " Ping " offered an unprecedented challenge for Henn . In order to solve this unique dilemma , Henn was provided with " the opportunity to ... adjust her design a little bit so that when she was disguised as Ping , as a soldier , that she was physically a little different in how we drew her than when she was herself as Mulan . " Physically , Mulan was also designed to appear less feminine than preceding traditional Disney animated heroines , specifically Pocahontas from Pocahontas ( 1995 ) and Esmeralda from The Hunchback of Notre Dame ( 1996 ) , because " you can 't pass as a man in the army with a Barbie @-@ style figure . " 
 Henn revealed that he was drawn to " Mulan 's story [ because it ] was so unique and compelling that it just captivated me from the beginning " . Animating the characters ' distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn . The animator explained , " We don 't create realism in the sense that if you 're doing a human character , it 's not going to look realistic ... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools that you have in the design to convey the believable emotions that you want to get across . " In addition to Mulan , Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou , Mulan 's elderly father . He described the complex relationship between the two characters as " the emotional heart of the story " . <unk> one daughter himself , Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters . 
 Several film critics have described Mulan as a tomboy . Andy Patrizio of IGN observed , " In this slightly modernized version of the story , Mulan ... is something of a rebel and a tomboy . She has no interest in being a good little subservient wife , despite her sighing parents ' wishes . " Jo Johnson , in contribution to the book Queers in American Popular Culture Volume 1 : Film and Television , wrote that " Unlike other Disney heroines , Mulan is immediately coded as a tomboy , " observing the way in which the character speaks using a full mouth . Johnson additionally noticed several ways in which Mulan 's design and personality differ from those typically associated with traditional Disney heroines and princesses , citing the character 's clumsy , awkward demeanor ; broad shoulders and muscular limbs ; unruly single strand of hair ; and choice of everyday attire which usually consists of loose , baggy clothing concealing her " traditionally slim Disney waist . " Additionally , Mulan 's intelligence has been observed in several professional analyses , with critics often citing the character as " brainy . "

Mushu , desiring to see Mulan succeed , creates a fake order from Li Shang 's father , General Li , ordering Li Shang to follow them into the mountains . They arrive at a burnt @-@ out village and discover that General Li and his forces have been wiped out by the Huns . As they solemnly leave the mountains , they are ambushed by the Huns when Mushu accidentally fired a cannon causing their position to be given away , but a second firing of a cannon by Mulan buries most of the enemy forces in an avalanche . Mulan is slashed by Shan Yu in his rage at her wiping out his army during the battle , and she is forced to reveal her deception when she receives medical attention . Instead of executing Mulan as the law states , Li Shang spares her life for saving his life from the avalanche by leaving her on the mountain as the rest of the army departs for the Imperial City to report the news of the Huns ' demise . However , the avalanche failed to eliminate all the enemies , as Mulan catches sight of a small number of surviving Huns , including Shan Yu , making their way to the City , intent on capturing the Emperor . 
 In the Imperial City , Mulan attempts to warn Li Shang about Shan Yu , but he refuses to listen . The Huns appear and capture the Emperor , locking themselves inside the palace .

Meanwhile , acting on Mulan 's instructions , Mushu fires a bundle of fireworks rockets at Shan Yu on her signal and kills him . 
 Mulan is praised by the Emperor and the people of China , who all bow to her , an unprecedented honor . Mulan accepts the Emperor 's crest and Shan Yu 's sword as gifts , but politely declines his offer to be his advisor and instead asks to return to her family . She returns home and presents the imperial gifts to her father , but he is more overjoyed to have his daughter back safely . Li Shang , who has become enamored with Mulan , soon arrives under the guise of returning her helmet , but accepts the family 's invitation for dinner . Earlier in the film , Mulan was declared unfit for marriage , but this now appears not to be the case with her strong budding romance with Li Shang . Mushu is granted a position as a Fa family guardian by the ancestors amid a returning celebration .

 Reception towards Mulan 's personality and characterization have been generally positive . Time Out hailed Mulan as " A feisty young go @-@ getter [ who ] rises above the male @-@ dominated world in which she lives . " Ken Fox of TV Guide wrote , " Intelligent and fiercely independent , Mulan ... runs afoul of social expectations that a woman will be always obedient and duty @-@ bound to her husband . " Bridget Byrne of Boxoffice wrote that " Mulan ... has pride , charm , spirit and aesthetic appeal which prevents her from being upstaged by the vigorous and exciting action in which she participates . " Variety 's Todd McCarthy praised the character for inspiring " a turn of the circle from such age @-@ old Disney classics ... in which passive heroines were rescued by blandly noble princes . " McCarthy continued , " Here , it 's the girl who does the rescuing , saving not only the prince but the emperor himself from oblivion , and this in a distant culture where women were expected to obey strictly prescribed rules . " Similarly , Margaret A. McGurk of The Cincinnati Inquirer lauded Mulan for " solv [ ing ] her G.I. Jane dilemma by proving that brains can do more than brawn . " Hailing the character as " Among the strongest heroines in Walt 's cartoon canon , " Ian Freer of Empire enthused , " Mulan 's engaging mixture of vulnerability and derring @-@ do becomes incredibly easy to root for . " Hollis <unk> of The Austin Chronicle dubbed Mulan a " winning protagonist . " Likewise , the Los Angeles Times ' Kenneth Turan wrote , " As a vivacious rebel who has to be true to herself no matter what , Mulan is an excellent heroine , perfect for the young female demographic the studio is most anxious to attract " , additionally calling her a " more likable and resourceful role model than Pocahontas " . 
 Although largely well @-@ liked , Mulan 's characterization has drawn some mild criticism and speculation , inspiring a series of generally mixed to positive reviews from some film critics . Entertainment Weekly 's Owen Gleiberman wrote , " Far more than Beauty and the Beast or the stolidly virtuous Pocahontas , Mulan showcases a girl who gets to use her wits ... a testament to the power of mind over brawn . " However , Gleiberman continued , " Mulan finally falls a notch short of Disney 's best ... because the heroine 's empowerment remains ... an emotionally isolated quest . " Similarly , Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times hailed Mulan as " a strong , engaging character who , unlike many of her Disney counterparts , needs no one to rescue her from danger , " while questioning her personality , asking , " was it really necessary to bestow Mulan with self @-@ esteem problems ? Because she seems so confident and intelligent , her sad statement that she wants to ' see something worthwhile ' in the mirror comes as a bit of a shock . " 
 Critics were not unanimous in their praise . The Phoenix 's Jeffrey Gantz felt that character was unoriginal , inaccurate and Westernized , writing , " [ her ] costumes ( particularly the kimono and obi Mulan wears to the Matchmaker ) and hairdos look Japanese ... Give Mulan Native American features and you have Pocahontas . " Similarly , James Berardinelli of ReelViews felt that the character 's depiction was too " familiar , " reviewing , " Although she looks different from Ariel , Belle , Jasmine , and Pocahontas , Mulan is very much the same type of individual : a woman with a strong , independent streak who is unwilling to bend to the customs of her culture , which decree that the role of the female is to be ornamental . The film isn 't very subtle in reinforcing the idea of equality between the sexes " . Additionally , some critics , such as Alex von Tunzelmann of The Guardian , have criticized Mulan for her violence , writing , " Disney struggles to make Mulan both a killer and a heroine ... <unk> , the film attempts to tread a middle path , implying that Mulan annihilates most of the Hun army by causing an avalanche , and having her dispatch Shan Yu with a load of fireworks . Very pretty . But still technically killing . " However , von Tunzelmann did conclude more positively , " as Disney heroines go , Mulan herself is a clear improvement on the standard @-@ issue drippy princess . "

 Unlike the generally positive reviews received by Mulan , critical reception towards the character 's romantic relationship with Li Shang has been largely negative , drawing much speculation from critics who accused Mulan of having " a typical girl @-@ hooks @-@ up @-@ with @-@ boy ending . " Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times observed , " The message here is standard feminist empowerment : <unk> the matchmaker , dress as a boy , and choose your own career . But Mulan has it both ways , since inevitably Mulan 's heart goes <unk> @-@ pat over Shang , the handsome young captain she 's assigned to serve under . The movie breaks with the tradition in which the male hero rescues the heroine , but is still totally sold on the Western idea of romantic love . " The New York Times ' Janet Maslin negatively opined , " For all of Mulan 's courage and independence in rebelling against the matchmakers , this is still enough of a fairy tale to need Mr. Right . " 
 Citing Mulan 's relationship with Shang as an example of sexism , a film critic writing for Teen Ink wrote : 
 " Mulan has been hailed as a feminist Disney movie because it showcases a young woman who leads China to victory using her quick wit , pride , and a strong sense of family honor — all while masquerading as a man named Ping . Even though Mulan ( as Ping ) gains the respect of the army commander and her comrades , once they discover that she is a woman , her army commander and potential love @-@ interest , Shang , loses respect for her and even hates her . " Ping " had been doing an even better job than Shang , but when Shang finds out Ping is a woman , his stupid male ego breaks on impact . Mulan is sentenced to death , and Shang , the macho man of the film , ultimately gets to decide her fate . The only reason she survives is because Shang decides he 'd rather just send her home . Wow . To add insult to injury , at the end of the film , Shang fixes up his shattered ego by claiming Mulan as a suitor . Even as Mulan is being praised and cheered in the Forbidden City after she almost single @-@ handedly saves China ( this time , as a woman ) , at the end of the film , the audience is reminded that Mulan is really just another woman looking for a man . Mulan 's real victory isn 't saving her country from invasion . No , it 's marrying Shang . " 
 Betsy Wallace of Common Sense Media observed that Mulan " doesn 't fit the princess mold , and most moviegoers had never heard of her . " <unk> , Wallace wrote , " it 's too bad that in the end she still needs to be married off to a ' Prince Charming ' who saves the day . " In contribution to the book Beyond Adaptation : Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works , Lan Dong wrote , " Even though Mulan achieves success after she resumes her female self ... it is compromised by Mulan and Li Shang 's potential engagement at the end of the film .

 = = = Cultural significance and accolades = = = 
 Mulan is culturally recognized for her unique role in Mulan specifically in regards to the character 's heroism , ethnicity and disinterest in romance , serving as a departure from traditional Disney heroines and princesses because she " challenged gender stereotypes and offered up an animated Disney experience that isn 't princess @-@ centric " as " one of the few strong , self @-@ propelled female characters that Disney has . " Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times observed the way in which Mulan 's role in the film as " an independent , not completely boy @-@ crazy heroine is somewhat new for Disney . " According to Sara Veal of The Jakarta Post , Mulan " promotes self @-@ reliance , determination and is uninterested in marriage or romance ... the film ends on her saving her country , rather than a romantic resolution . " Succeeding non @-@ white Disney Princesses Jasmine and Pocahontas , Mulan 's characterization as Disney 's first East Asian princess assisted in the diversification of the Disney Princess franchise , introducing " Disney princesses ... portrayed as women of color . " Peter Travers of ' " Rolling Stone commented , " Mulan ... makes a feisty prefeminist , " continuing , " She doesn 't swoon over Captain Shang , the hunky officer ... which leaves Shang ... frustrated ... Mulan , let the record show , does not put out . " PopMatters ' Jesse Hassenger wrote that unlike other Disney films , " Mulan holds the advantage of a smart , strong heroine — not just a <unk> princess figure . " Ryan Mazie of Box Office Prophets felt that Mulan " might be the most important and forward @-@ thinking Disney Princess movie made up until that point where the female character solely takes control over her own destiny without the aid of a mighty Prince . " 
 In 2012 , CNN 's Stephanie Goldberg recognized Mulan as one of Disney 's bravest and most heroic animated heroines to @-@ date in her article " Brave 's Merida and other animated heroines , " writing , " Mulan bent traditional gender roles when she took her father 's place in the Chinese army . " The Georgia Institute of Technology ranked Mulan the fourteenth greatest Disney character of all @-@ time . Similarly , in 2013 , Mulan was ranked the greatest animated Disney heroine according to a poll conducted by Jim Vejvoda of IGN . 
 In 1999 , Mulan 's theme song " Reflection " , performed by Mulan , was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song at the 56th Golden Globe Awards , but ultimately lost to Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli 's " The Prayer " from Quest for Camelot ( 1998 ) . " Reflection " is often credited with establishing the successful musical career of American recording artist Christina Aguilera , who famously recorded a pop rendition of the ballad prior to the release of her platinum @-@ selling self @-@ titled debut album in 1999 , on which the song is featured . Additionally , the song peaked at number nineteen on the <unk> Contemporary chart . In 2011 , Salonga was honored with a Disney Legends award in commemoration of her role as Mulan 's singing voice . Additionally , Salonga performed a live rendition of " Reflection " at the ceremony . 
 = = = Redesign Controversy = = = 
 The 2013 Disney princess redesigns portrayed Mulan with features that differ from her film appearance . The artwork featured Mulan with blue eyes , bigger lips , noticeably lighter skin , and golden clothing which does not resemble any outfit she has worn in the film . Her new appearance has caused an uproar due to the whitewash of her character . This was particularly troubling as Mulan is one of the few princesses of color . Shavon L. McKinstry of <unk> Movement writes that Mulan 's redesign " seem to be directly counter to her personality and character in her film " , and also notes how all the princesses of color have been " noticeably pushed to the back or left out completely " from the new Disney merchandise which featured the redesigns . 
 Through stereotypical images , dialogue and action , it is easy for the audience to make the distinction between good characters and bad characters . Good characters " have big eyes and round cheeks and are drawn in curves , smooth , round , soft bright and with European features " ( Xu , M & Tian , C. 2013 ) , while bad characters are defined by having " sharp angles , oversized , and often darkly " ( Xu , M & Tian , C. 2013 ) . Disney indisputably represents an empire of symbols of westernized imperialism and cultural hegemony and of globalization that dominates within their heroes . These visual keys help the audience know who to root for in the film and what behaviours and morals you wish to follow if you want to achieve greatness like the heroes . 
 McKinstry argues that Disney " prefers to portray one demographic of princess , simultaneously alienating so much of their fanbase " , pointing out that of the " ten Disney Princesses in the brand , six are white " . The importance of Mulan and other non @-@ white princesses can be seen in the 2009 study of the effects of children 's cartoons on the body image of young girls by doctors Sharon Hayes and Stacey <unk> @-@ Dunn . The study revealed that in the group of girls ranging from 3 to 6 years old , 30 @.@ 6 % of the group would change their physical appearance if they could . Of these respondents , over half would change their hair and over a quarter would change something about their body , such as skin color . Of all girls surveyed , 8 % said they would have to change their hair or skin color to become a princess , stating things like they would " change from brown skin to white skin " , for example . The interviewed group was predominantly white . 
 Disney has since altered the coloration in Mulan 's design by changing the blue eye highlight to brown , darkening the color of her skin , and changing her clothing to better resemble her attire in the film .

 " Hold Tight " is a song recorded by American singer Madonna featured on her thirteenth studio album , Rebel Heart ( 2015 ) . The track was written and produced by Madonna , with additional writing provided by Diplo , MoZella , Toby Gad , Ariel Rechtshaid , and MNEK . A demo of " Hold Tight " was leaked onto the internet on December 22 , 2014 , while its final version was released by Madonna on February 9 , 2015 on iTunes Store . The song was later sent to Italian radio on July 24 , 2015 , as the third single from Rebel Heart in that country . 
 " Hold Tight " is a midtempo pop song , with it incorporating military drums , atmospheric keyboards , and flourishes of electronics as its instrumentation . Lyrically , the song talks about love triumphing through tough times , having a message of holding onto one another and being strong . The song received mixed reviews from music critics , with some praising its chorus and picking it as a standout track . Others named it dull and generic . The song charted in a few European territories , reaching the top 40 in Finland , Hungary , and Spain .

 Initially , Madonna was set to release her thirteenth studio album , Rebel Heart , in March 2015 , with its lead @-@ single set to premiere on Valentine 's day of the same year . However , fifteen demos of her songs were leaked to the Internet between November and December 2014 , which led the singer to release six completed tracks onto iTunes as pre @-@ order for the album on December 20 , 2014 . Three days later , fourteen other tracks leaked online , including the demo version of " Hold Tight " . On February 9 , 2015 , Madonna released three more tracks from the album , including the finished version of " Hold Tight " , " Iconic " and " Joan of Arc " , as well as the album 's tracklist . 
 After its full release , some websites suggested that Ryan Tedder was the song 's producer , since he had confirmed to be he working on material for Rebel Heart , claiming that the songs were " [ Madonna 's ] best stuff in over a decade " and that " [ t ] he tracks [ he did ] with her are really hard to explain " . However , Tedder 's productions were not used in the album 's final track list , although rumors claimed him to be the producer of " Hold Tight " . Later , Diplo was rumored to be its producer , but eventually it was confirmed on Madonna 's official website that she produced the track herself . " Hold Tight " was selected as the third single from Rebel Heart single in Italy , and was added to the country 's radio stations on July 24 , 2015 .

 " Hold Tight " was written and produced by Madonna , with additional writing by Diplo , Toby Gad , MoZella , Ariel Rechtshaid and MNEK ; the latter also provided background vocals . Demacio " Demo " Castellon and Nick Rowe were the song 's engineers , while Castellon and Mike Dean did the song 's mixing . Additional recording was done by Angie Teo , while additional Pro Tools editing was made by Ron Taylor . " Hold Tight " was recorded in three different places : The Ritz ( Moscow ) , Grand Marina Hotel ( Barcelona ) and Patriot Studios ( Denver , Colorado / Venice , California ) . MNEK , who co @-@ wrote and provided background vocals on the track , remembered that he was working with English duo Gorgon City in 2014 , when they recommended him to Diplo , for working on Rebel Heart . Together they started out with an idea for " Hold Tight " , and Madonna loved it . After finishing writing the lyrics , she invited MNEK to the recording studio to finish its production . The rapper commented about the session with Madonna in an interview with Digital Spy , claiming : 
 It was cool . It was a really nice session , she was really lovely . [ ... ] And I guess as the song ( ' Hold Tight ' ) came out , her fans seem to respond it really well , so yeah , awesome ! And she 's a legend , and it 's an awesome opportunity to work with someone like Madonna who 's literally shaped the careers of so many artists that I 've wanted to work with and that I look up to . She 's the queen ! . 
 " Hold Tight " is a " reflective and sombre " midtempo pop ballad , having atmospheric keyboards , military drums and flourishes of pastel electronics as its main instrumentation . Its " tribal " chorus " gallops euphorically over twinkling arpeggio , picked out by a Juno whistle " , which according to The Quietus ' Amy Pettifer , is " reminiscent of Kate Bush 's ' Running Up that Hill ' . John Marrs of Gay Times noted the song 's synths remind of " Confessions on a Dance Floor " ' s ' Forbidden Love ' and the " euphoric instrumentals " of British electronica band Faithless . Lyrically , the song talks about holding on and being strong , with Madonna singing about being " scarred and bruised " . For Adam R. Holz of Plugged In , the song permeates in the same lyrical content of " Living for Love " , while Pettifer noted that it 's " a galvanising anthem of shoulder @-@ to @-@ shoulder survival that 's collective and communal , rather than intimate and romantic . "

 Joe Lynch of Billboard described the song as " an immediately familiar track with an epic , arresting chorus . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote the track " nips at its heels " , giving emphasis to " the space Madonna 's voice is given to shine — something we 'd like to hear more often " . Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times described it as an " old @-@ school pop " song and picked it as a standout track , whilst John Marrs of Gay Times claimed that " the mid @-@ tempo track underpinned by a dirty bass bears little resemblance to the sparse , pedestrian demo , " also noting that " when the melody is lush as this , she could be singing a recipe from Mary Berry 's cookbook as far as we care . " Amy Pettifer of The Quietus saw it as " Shakira 's ' Whenever , Wherever ' as seen through the murky lens of a lost generation . " 
 Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine called it a " perfectly acceptable album filler : innocuous , lyrically platitudinous pop that briefly works itself up into something exciting when it threatens to become a <unk> stomp . " However , Mac noted that " [ i ] t wouldn 't be particularly lamentable were it not for the fact that there are so many better choices for the standard edition of the album that have been relegated to bonus tracks . " Ludovic Hunter @-@ Tilney of Financial Times called it a " dull ballad " , while for Saeed Saeed of The National the song " is the first of a few tracks that should have been cut , " criticizing its " atmospheric keyboards " for being " sleep @-@ inducing . " Evan Sawdey of PopMatters named it one of the album 's " forgettable jams " and a " generic thump , " meanwhile Lydia Jenkins of The New Zealand Herald opined that " Hold Tight " has " so little substance [ that ] it seems wrong to call it a song . " 
 Following its digital release on February 9 , 2015 as " instant grat " for pre @-@ ordering the album , " Hold Tight " entered the record chart in several countries . In the United Kingdom , the song was unable to enter the UK Singles Chart , but it reached number 97 on its download chart . It also charted at number 92 on the singles chart compiled by Syndicat National de l 'Édition Phonographique in France . " Hold Tight " became top 40 entry in Spain and Hungary , and on the digital charts of <unk> and Sweden .

 = Dorothy McKibbin = 
 Dorothy McKibbin ( December 12 , 1897 – December 17 , 1985 ) worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II . She ran the project 's office at 109 East Palace in Santa Fe , through which staff moving to the Los Alamos Laboratory passed . She was known as the " first lady of Los Alamos " , and was often the first point of contact for new arrivals . She retired when the Santa Fe office closed in 1963 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Dorothy Ann Scarritt was born in Kansas City , Missouri , on December 12 , 1897 , the fourth of five children of William Chick Scarritt , a corporate lawyer , and his wife Frances Virginia née Davis . She had two older brothers , William Hendrix ( known as Bill ) and Arthur Davis ( known as A.D. ) , and an older sister , Frances . A younger sister , Virginia , died in 1907 . Dorothy was known as Dink to her family and close friends . Her father was active in political and social life in Kansas City , serving as its police commissioner from 1896 to 1897 , and president of the Board of Park Commissioners in 1922 . 
 The family believed strongly in the value of education . Scarritt attended The Barstow School , a small independent preparatory school in Kansas City , where she was editor of the school literary magazine , a member of the drama group , and played forward on the school basketball team . She graduated in 1915 , and later that year entered Smith College , a liberal arts college in Northampton , Massachusetts . At the time it was the largest of the Women 's colleges in the United States . She considered majoring in English and history , ultimately settling on the latter . She was elected class president in her first year . She participated in the Smith College Association for Christian Work , and the Sociology and Current Events Clubs , and helped raise $ 25 @,@ 000 for refugees from World War I. She enjoyed tennis , swimming , hiking and mountain climbing , and played on a class basketball team , and for the All @-@ Smith baseball team . 
 After graduating from Smith in 1919 , Scarritt travelled to Europe with her father in 1921 , and then to Alaska , western Canada and Yosemite National Park in 1923 . In September 1923 , she met Joseph Chambers McKibbin while visiting a Smith College friend in <unk> , Minnesota . She toured Quebec , Newfoundland , Nova Scotia and the Thousand Islands in 1924 , and in 1925 went with her father to Cuba , Panama , Peru , Chile and Argentina . Scarritt and Joseph McKibbin became engaged , but after she returned from South America in 1925 she was diagnosed with tuberculosis , a disease from which her sister Frances had died in 1919 , and she broke off their engagement . 
 = = New Mexico = = 
 As there were no effective drugs to treat the contagious disease , tuberculosis patients were sent to sanatoria , where they either recovered or died . The sunshine and dry climate of the southwestern states was considered conducive to recovery , and several sanatoria were located there . The family chose Sunmount near Santa Fe , New Mexico , a sanatorium that was more like a resort than a hospital . Scarritt arrived with her mother in November 1925 to find that Sunmount had a waiting list for admissions . After some lobbying , she was admitted on December 9 , 1925 . She fell in love with both the landscape and the culture of New Mexico . After a year , she was pronounced cured , and left on December 22 , 1927 . 
 Scarritt and Joseph renewed their engagement , and were married in the garden of her family 's home in Kansas City on October 5 , 1927 . After a honeymoon in Rio de Janeiro , they moved to St. Paul , Minnesota , where Joseph worked in his father 's fur business , McKibbin , Driscoll and Dorsey . They had a son , Kevin , who was born on December 6 , 1930 , but Joseph was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma , and died on October 27 , 1931 . 
 Now a single mother , McKibbin chose to return to Santa Fe . She loaded her possessions into a Ford Model A , and accompanied by Kevin and Joseph 's sister Maggie , drove there . It was almost a month before they arrived on June 11 , 1932 . Between the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl drought , jobs were hard to find , but McKibbin found employment as a bookkeeper for the Spanish and Indian Trading Company , a small firm that sold handicrafts and artworks . The owners , Norman McGee and Jim McMillan left the day @-@ to @-@ day running of the business in the hands of McKibbin , whom they paid 50c an hour . 
 McKibbin gave up her job in May 1935 to spend more time with Kevin . Her father lost most of his money in the Great Depression , but he still had enough to help her buy a house . Instead of buying , McKibbin decided to build . On April 21 , 1936 , she purchased 1 @.@ 5 acres ( 0 @.@ 61 ha ) not far from Sunmount . She designed her house with Katherine Stinson , an aviatrix that she had met as a fellow patient at Sunmount . They based the design on that of 19th @-@ century Spanish farmhouses and ranches in the area . The house was furnished with antique fittings acquired through the Spanish and Indian Trading Company . Land and construction costs totalled $ 10 @,@ 000 . Her father was a frequent visitor , overseeing various stages of construction . 
 In 1937 , Kevin was diagnosed with endocarditis , a potentially life @-@ threatening disease . There was no treatment for it but bed rest , so he spent the entire 1937 – 38 school year in bed . Her father died from bronchial pneumonia on February 16 , 1938 . In 1938 , she took Kevin to the Children 's Hospital Los Angeles , along with her mother and her aunt Nana . The doctors there told them that Kevin had been misdiagnosed , and actually had tonsillitis . The tonsils were removed , and he left cured . When he started school again , McKibbin returned to her old job at the Spanish and Indian Trading Company . 
 = = Manhattan Project = = 
 After the outbreak of World War II , the owners of the Spanish and Indian Trading Company decided to switch to war @-@ related opportunities , and in 1943 the company closed down , putting McKibbin out of a job . Then in March 1943 , she was approached by three men from California seeking to establish a new office in Santa Fe , who offered to hire her as a secretary . She was particularly impressed by one of them . She later wrote : 
 I thought to be associated with that person , whoever he was , would be simply great ! I never met a person with a magnetism that hit you so fast and so completely as his did . I didn 't know what he did . I thought maybe if he were digging trenches to put in a new road , I would love to do that , or if he were soliciting ads for a magazine or something , I would love to do that . I just wanted to be allied and have something to do with a person of such vitality and radiant force . 
 The man was Robert Oppenheimer , a professor from the University of California at Berkeley , establishing a new , secret laboratory for the Manhattan Project , the wartime effort to build an atomic bomb . McKibbin became the first permanent employee of the Manhattan Project 's Santa Fe office , which opened at 109 East Palace Avenue on March 27 , 1943 . The office had just five rooms , all purposely small so they could be easily heated in winter with small fireplaces . Joe Stephenson handled housing ; Duane Muncy , the comptroller from the University of California was business manager ; Dana Mitchell , a chemistry professor from Columbia University was in charge of scientific supplies . Oppenheimer was in charge , assisted by his secretary , Priscilla Greene . When Edward Condon and his secretary Isabel Bemis arrived from Berkeley , they had to be squeezed in . Greene bought a typewriter in Santa Fe with her own money . McKibbin 's salary was $ 150 per month . Initially Stephenson paid it out of petty cash . She subsequently was made an employee of the University of California . 
 At first , McKibbin was unsure what they wanted her to do . Her duties evolved over time . She became Oppenheimer 's deputy in Santa Fe , and ran the housing office , which was nothing more than a front for the top secret laboratory under construction 35 miles ( 56 km ) away . This became the Los Alamos Laboratory , but the name was never used in Santa Fe . It was simply " the Hill " . She was acquainted with Los Alamos , being friends with the poet and author Peggy Pond Church , the daughter of <unk> Pond , the founder of the Los Alamos Ranch School there . McKibbin would meet new arrivals , and issue them with passes without which they would not get past the guards . She came to be known as " the gatekeeper to Los Alamos " , and the " first lady of Los Alamos " , Before she left work each night , she had to burn every scrap of paper produced during the day . 
 McKibbin was on call 24 hours a day , and Oppenheimer would often phone her in the middle of the night . Frequently her house was overrun by guests . She later recalled that : 
 There was never a dull moment . The office was a madhouse . It was bedlam . We worked six days a week but even so I couldn 't wait to get back to work in the morning . There were always people who needed attention — they were hungry , exhausted , in a hurry . 
 By May 1943 , there was a telephone line to Los Alamos , and enough facilities has been constructed to allow Oppenheimer and his staff to move there . He offered McKibbin a position at Los Alamos but she declined , and remained in Santa Fe , running the office at 109 East Palace . Her duties remained many and various . She looked after children and pets , guarded briefcases and secret papers . She was the one the residents of Los Alamos turned to when they needed a puppy , a goose for Oppenheimer 's Christmas dinner , or a doctor who performed abortions . Laura Fermi recalled that : 
 Dorothy McKibbin stayed calm and unruffled surrounded by large boxes and crates to be hauled by truck to the mesa and by the piles of small parcels that shopping women dumped on the floor to make room for further purchases in their bags . All women brought their difficulties and their checks to Dorothy . She endorsed the latter so they could be cashed at the bank , and smoothed out the first : Yes , she knew of a boys ' camp ; Yes , she could recommend a good eating place ; Yes , she could arrange for a ride to the mesa later in the evening ; Yes , she would try to get reservations for a good hotel in Albuquerque ; Yes , she could give them the key to the ladies ' room . 
 Marriages were performed at McKibbin 's house . Greene married Robert Duffield in a ceremony there on September 5 , 1943 . McKibben had a local judge conduct the ceremony , but due to the project 's security , he was not allowed to know the surnames of the couple . It was the first of a series of weddings . Just three weeks later everyone assembled again for the wedding of Greene 's bridesmaid , Marjorie Hall , to Hugh Bradner . About thirty weddings were held there , including that of Peter Oppenheimer , Robert 's son . 
 In May 1944 , Oppenheimer gave McKibbin another assignment . The numbers of staff at Los Alamos had greatly expanded , and the dormitories intended to house them were unfinished . Another eighty people were expected to arrive over the summer . The Army had taken over the <unk> Canyon Lodge in the <unk> National Monument and McKibbin was asked to prepare it to receive them . She had no experience running a hotel but left the Santa Fe office in the hands of an assistant for six weeks and took up residence at the Lodge in June 1944 . With help from the Army and women she brought in she was able to prepare it for occupation in five days . When the expected numbers did not arrive , she turned it into a rest resort for Los Alamos scientists . Perhaps her most unusual assignment though , was scanning the skies for signs of Japanese fire balloons . 
 On July 15 , 1945 , two couples arrived at 109 East Palace and asked McKibbin to join them for an evening picnic on Sandia Peak near Albuquerque . At 5 : 30 am the next morning , she watched the sky light up from the Trinity nuclear test . 
 = = Later life = = 
 After the war ended in August 1945 , there were doubts as to whether the Los Alamos Laboratory would remain , not to mention the Santa Fe office . Now McKibbin was arranging people 's departures . No one was sadder to see Oppenheimer depart on October 16 , 1945 . His successor , Norris Bradbury , agreed to take over the director 's position for six months . He would remain for 25 years . He kept the laboratory open , and retained the Santa Fe office open , with McKibbin as its head . 
 On June 7 , 1949 , McKibbin was in Washington , D.C. , for a Smith College reunion , and went to watch Oppenheimer appear before the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee , sitting beside Anne Wilson Marks , who had succeeded Priscilla Greene as Oppenheimer 's secretary at the Los Alamos Laboratory . In May 1950 , Sylvia Crouch alleged that Oppenheimer had conducted secret communist meetings at his home in Berkeley in July 1941 . McKibbin conducted a meticulous investigation that produced a detailed paper trail demonstrating that Oppenheimer was in Santa Fe at the time . In April and May 1954 , the Atomic Energy Commission conducted the Oppenheimer security hearing , which resulted in the loss of Oppenheimer 's security clearance . When Edward Teller , who had testified against Oppenheimer , next appeared at Los Alamos , McKibbin gave him an icy reception . 
 The Santa Fe office closed on June 28 , 1963 , and McKibbin retired . There was a brief ceremony conducted by Bradbury , who presented a memorial plaque . When Oppenheimer was awarded the Atomic Energy Commission 's Enrico Fermi Award in 1963 , he invited McKibbin to join him at the White House reception . She intended to do so , but the assassination of President John F. Kennedy , whom she had met when he toured Los Alamos on December 7 , 1962 , cast a pall over the event , and she decided not to attend . Oppenheimer received the award from the new President , Lyndon B. Johnson . 
 McKibbin 's eyesight began to fail in the 1950s . She had cataract operations in 1952 , and thereafter needed to wear thick glasses . She died at her home in Santa Fe on December 17 , 1985 . She was buried in the Santa Fe Memorial Gardens . Dorothy McKibbin Hall at the Los Alamos Historical Museum is named after her . The entrance to the hall is the actual gate that was at 109 East Palace .

 " There 's More Than One of Everything " is the finale of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe . The finale followed David Robert Jones ' ( Jared Harris ) attempts to open a doorway to the parallel universe , while the Fringe team tries to stop him . It ends with FBI agent Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) discovering a startling secret about Massive Dynamic founder William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) . 
 The episode 's story was co @-@ written by Akiva Goldsman and Bryan Burk , and the teleplay was co @-@ written by Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman , while Brad Anderson directed . The episode marked the first appearance of guest actor Nimoy as William Bell . Co @-@ creator J.J. Abrams , having worked with Nimoy on the 2009 film Star Trek , begged the actor to join the series through a series of phone conversations . Nimoy signed on for three episodes and found playing the character to be a " unique experience " after so many years portraying Spock . 
 The episode first aired on May 12 , 2009 in the United States , and was watched by an estimated 9 @.@ 28 million viewers . " There 's More Than One of Everything " received mostly good reviews , with many critics praising the revelations concerning the parallel universe . Many critics offered opinions on the depiction of the Twin Towers , with most reactions being positive . 
 = = Plot = = 
 While Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ) recovers from the gunshot sustained in the previous episode , the Fringe team 's investigation reveals that the man in white bandages is David Robert Jones ( Jared Harris ) . Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) and Phillip Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) discuss locating William Bell for questioning , whom they believe is behind all the fringe events that have been occurring all season . 
 Meanwhile , Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) is at a graveyard , where he solemnly stares at an unknown gravestone . Olivia , Peter Bishop ( Joshua Jackson ) , and Astrid Farnsworth ( Jasika Nicole ) begin searching for Walter . Nina tells Olivia that an energy cell was stolen from her mechanical arm by Jones , and that he was formerly a Massive Dynamic employee who had looked up to Bell as a " father figure " until they had a falling out . When Olivia demands to speak to Bell , Nina explains that she does not know where he is , as Bell has been communicating these past few months " strictly electronically " . Nina believes Jones is trying to confront Bell , and promises Olivia that if she stops Jones , Nina will arrange a meeting between her and Bell . 
 On a busy New York City street , Jones and his team use the energy cell to open a doorway into a parallel universe and bring a truck through , but are apparently unsuccessful , as Jones complains he used the " wrong coordinates " . Having previously observed Walter at the graveyard , The Observer ( Michael Cerveris ) arrives with Walter at the Bishops ' beach house , and gives Walter a coin , telling him to remember what he has to find . Walter goes on alone into the house , while Olivia and Charlie interview witnesses who saw Jones extract the truck from the doorway . They discover that the truck 's VIN numbers do not exist , which implies the " truck was never made " . A further interview with Nina reveals to the Fringe team that the truck is from another universe , and that Jones is using the stolen energy cell to travel to that universe . 
 Peter finds Walter and chooses to meet his father alone , as he believes Walter is upset from the past several days . Now at the beach house , Peter and Walter search for and retrieve a device that can seal shut the doorway into the other universe . Walter explains to Peter that he once lost something very dear to him and that he had to go and bring it back from another reality ; the device was created to prevent something from following him . 
 After Jones makes another unsuccessful attempt to open a doorway at a soccer field in Providence , Olivia searches through old case files related to science and unexplained phenomena , and discovers a geographic connection between the soccer field , the city street , and several of their past Fringe cases . Olivia and Walter come to the same conclusion , that Jones is going to use a site at Reiden Lake to reopen the doorway , the epicenter of these Fringe events . Olivia , Peter , and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it . Peter triggers Walter 's device , killing Jones by sealing the doorway . 
 At the end of the episode , Walter again goes alone to visit the graveyard ; he tearfully observes a gravestone marked " Peter Bishop 1978 @-@ 1985 " , suggesting that Walter 's legitimate son died . Nina Sharp later calls Olivia and implies to her that she can meet William Bell in Manhattan . On the way to the hotel she almost gets into a car crash , at which point she is transported to the parallel universe . After no one shows up at the hotel restaurant . Olivia leaves , as she assumes that she got stood up . However , when in an elevator to leave the building , Olivia is teleported to another location and is directed to an office . After reading a newspaper headline indicating that President Obama was preparing to move into the " new " White House , she is greeted by William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) and inquires where she is . The final shot pans out the window revealing that they are standing inside the South Tower of the World Trade Center .

Abrams already had a relationship after working together on the 2009 film Star Trek ; Abrams stated in an interview that he called Nimoy and begged him to join Fringe , explaining the show and the character . Nimoy sounded interested but wanted to become more familiar with the show , so Abrams and the other producers sent him as much information as they could about Fringe , until Nimoy agreed . This exchange of phone calls , in which Nimoy responded with interest when pitched the idea , was also how Abrams was able to cast him in his Star Trek reboot . Nimoy later explained " When they contacted me about working on ' Fringe ' -- the same people , the same attitude , the same creativity , the same creative team – it was very enticing " . According to Abrams , " The idea that he will play the mysterious , much @-@ referenced William Bell is a thrill . I know I sound like a goofy fan boy , but I can ’ t help it : Leonard is an icon of the genre and such a wonderful actor . To have him come on board Fringe is a mind @-@ blowing honor " . 
 Nimoy was hired for three episodes , beginning with the season finale . Fringe co @-@ creator Roberto Orci described Nimoy 's character as " a mix of Howard Hughes and Bill Gates " , while Nimoy referred to Bell as a " master of the universe " who is " brilliant , wealthy and very powerful " . Nimoy 's part of the final scene of the episode with Olivia was very brief . Nimoy described the scene as " interesting , entertaining " and " that you 'll want to see more of this relationship and what it 's all about " . Actress Anna Torv described the final scene as calm yet threatening , " That 's what 's kind of cool about working on Fringe , is everything seems kind of calm and lovely , but there 's always something going on underneath " . While shooting , Nimoy commented that the character " was a unique experience , " as he had not acted outside of the Spock character for a number of years . Nimoy has stated in multiple interviews that his Fringe role will be the last project in his acting career .

 The episode 's teleplay was co @-@ written by executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman , while consulting producer Akiva Goldsman and executive producer Bryan Burk co @-@ wrote the story . Producer Brad Anderson served as episode director , his fourth credit of the season . J.J. Abrams called the finale " the end of one chapter and the start of another " , and believed it was " a huge turning point " for all three main characters . 
 Co @-@ creator and executive producer Roberto Orci explained in an interview that the big reveal at the end of the episode , in which Olivia meets Bell in the parallel universe , was actually planned for a fourth season , but the writers decided " let 's actually answer something instead and not get , not just rely on that mystery forever . And so we actually chose to give kind of a big answer and have to come with a different show than we ever intended " . The writers wanted to use an iconic image for the scene , leading to staff writer Andrew Kreisberg 's suggestion of the Twin Towers . Wyman first thought it was " the greatest idea in the world " before having doubts that its use would " sensationalize " it . He explained , " But then , when we started thinking about it , we thought collectively America really understood 9 / 11 is such a monumental moment so we felt it wasn ’ t exploited but indicative of the times we ’ re living in right now . We used it and that was the end of the first season and then we were all really thrilled with where it was going . " The cast would later recollect on the series , and for Jackson , considered that the show has never " had a better visual or a better cliff @-@ hanger " as this finale . 
 To create the scene where Jones brings a semi truck from the parallel universe , the special effects crew took a smaller truck and dressed it enough so that it seemed like the longer semi with the help of CGI ; the result was that in the episode , the viewer is led to believe that the truck had been " cut " in half after unsuccessfully entering the prime universe doorway . It was rigged so that it appeared to be on a tilt , and cables linked it to smash into a passing car . As the production crew considered William Bell to be a " Renaissance man " , they filled Bell 's office with " things that inspire him , " such as a prototype of Nina 's mechanical arm and other items that " evoke images and stimulate thought " .

 In the final scene set in the parallel universe , a newspaper states the ( presumably recently inaugurated ) Obamas are moving into the " new " White House , indicating that the traditional presidential residence had been recently rebuilt .

 The episode received generally positive reviews , with multiple critics lauding the performances of actors Anna Torv and John Noble . In his review for Entertainment Weekly , critic Ken Tucker wrote this his " mind was blown not once , but twice " due to the many revelations about two universes ; Fringe " has vaulted to the upper reaches of current television " . In a second review , Tucker praised the " beautifully , startlingly executed " special effects when the " hole " in the universe closed . Writing for A.V. Club , critic Zach Handlen gave the episode an A , and felt the episode made him want to go back and rewatch season one because the finale had " so many references and back story nods that I wanted to have everything in my head together " . Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought the finale " leads to a wealth of possibilities ... The déjà universe was a bold move . I can ’ t wait to see what our friends at Fringe do with it " . Writing for the Chicago Tribune , critic Maureen Ryan heaped praise on the " excellent " episode , and complimented " the quietly creepy atmosphere , the slowly building tension in the dual Walter / Olivia stories , the way those stories were skillfully woven together , the suitably tense lakeside encounter between Olivia , Peter and Mr. Jones " . 
 Though some critics appreciated how Fringe chose to end the finale with a shot of the World Trade Center , others disliked it . Jeff Pinkner defended their decision by explaining they chose it because the building is " obviously very iconic " and it best displayed that in the parallel universe , " things are both better and in some ways worse . It 's just different choices , the road not taken " . Leonard Nimoy also defended the writers , commenting that when he received the script , he thought it " was very interesting and really kind of daring contemporary television to pull in that story ... You know , it 's not easy to use that kind of stuff without seeming somehow exploitive . But I thought they did it very , very well " . Many critics expressed that because of the episode , they couldn 't wait for the following season to begin . IGN 's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9 @.@ 2 / 10 , while website blogger io9 listed " There 's More Than One of Everything " as one of the " crucial " episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show . 
 The Futon Critic listed it the 16th best television episode of 2009 , explaining " J.J. Abrams and company know all about big reveals ... but this one , in which William Bell reveals himself as living in a parallel universe where the Twin Towers weren 't lost , was one of their most indelible " . In a comparison of " There 's More Than One of Everything " and The X @-@ Files episode " 4 @-@ D " , UGO Networks columnist Alex Zalben wrote that the Fringe episode won " by a landslide . This episode kicked the show into high gear , while ' 4 @-@ D ' was The X @-@ Files winding down . " Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named " There 's More Than One of Everything " the seventh best episode of the series , calling it " the episode that changed everything ... With that , the most hyped show of the 2008 @-@ 2009 TV season produced a moment that finally earned it buzz . " Den of Geek ranked the episode as the fifth best of the entire series , while IGN ranked it the ninth best .

 Recurring characters of Halo are organized below by their respective factions in the fictional universe . The multimedia franchise 's central story revolves around an interstellar war between future humanity under the auspices of the United Nations Space Command or UNSC , and an alien theocratic alliance known as the Covenant . The artifacts left behind by an ancient race known as the Forerunner play a central role , particularly the massive weapons , dubbed Halos , built to contain the parasitic Flood . Beginning with developer Bungie 's 2001 video game Halo : Combat Evolved , the franchise expanded to include numerous sequel video games , novels , comics , and other works . 
 In the foreword for a collection titled The Art of Halo , Bungie founder Jason Jones noted that bringing together the elements of a video game is unmistakably " art " . However , Jones also noted that the character designers and artists had to make a " living , breathing world " and populate it with interesting characters and places . The game 's development which spanned four years brought numerous evolutions and revisions to the character 's designs and personalities . Characters were also updated to take full advantage of new graphics technologies ; for instance , the Master Chief 's armor was redesigned in a lengthy conceptual process and the final model was bump mapped . Each video game offered opportunities to refine the character 's appearances and design . 
 Halo 's commercial and critical success has led to large amounts of merchandise featuring the franchise 's characters to be produced . The Master Chief , the most visible symbol of the series , has been heavily marketed , with the character 's visage appearing on soda bottles , T @-@ shirts , and Xbox controllers . Other merchandise produced includes several sets of action figures , produced by Joyride Studios and McFarlane Toys among other manufacturers . Halo 's characters have received varying reception , with characters such as the Chief , Cortana , and the Arbiter well received by critics . 
 = = Character design and creation = = 
 Halo 's characters were continually refined through development , as the company was bought by Microsoft and the platform shifted from the Macintosh to the Xbox . Other Bungie developers would often add input to the progress of characters in Halo , even if they were not working on the game itself . For example , an outside artist , Shi Kai Wang , developed the early concept sketches of what would eventually become the Master Chief . However upon developing a 3D model , the artists decided the Chief looked too slender , almost effeminate , and subsequently bulked up the character . Early Covenant Elites had a more natural jaw rather than the split mandibles they would later sport ; at one point , Jason Jones was also insistent about having a tail on the Elites , but this idea was eventually dropped . 
 Designers decided to hand @-@ key animations , rather than attempt motion capture . The animators also often videotaped themselves to have reference footage for the movement of game characters . Art Director Marcus Lehto had his wife videotape him " running around a field with a two @-@ by @-@ four " for footage for human marines . By Halo 3 , Bungie staff had a special room designed for capturing reference material . Many of the subsequent human character 's features were based on Bungie designers , while character animators looked to simian , ursine , insectoid , and reptilian features for the various races of the Covenant . The artificial intelligences of the characters was also deliberately limited to make sure they acted realistically to environmental changes and situations .
