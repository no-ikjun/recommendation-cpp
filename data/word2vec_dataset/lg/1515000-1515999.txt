 Frome has more than 500 listed buildings , three of which ( including the parish church ) are grade I listed . The Blue House , next to the town bridge , is one of the grade I buildings ; it was formerly the Bluecoat School and Almshouses , named after the colour of the school uniforms . Built in 1726 at a cost of £ 1 @,@ 401 8s 9d , it replaced a previous almshouse dating from 1461 and rebuilt in 1621 . The Blue House provided a home for twenty widows and schooling for twenty boys . The front of the building is adorned by two statues , one of a man and the other a woman , indicating the building 's dual purpose . They are colloquially known as " Billy Ball " and " Nancy Guy " . The building 's role as a school came to an end in 1921 and it now provides studio and one @-@ bedroom flats for seventeen elderly residents . 
 Rook Lane Chapel was a <unk> chapel built between 1705 and 1707 by James Pope . The chapel had a gallery around three sides and the centre of the ceiling was domed and supported by two Tuscan columns . Rook Lane ceased to be used as a chapel in 1968 and there followed twenty @-@ five years of neglect . In the early 1990s the building was compulsorily purchased by Somerset County Council and transferred to the Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust , which carried out repairs and restorations . In 2001 it was converted by a firm of architects , the ground floor becoming a community hall and arts centre managed by Rook Lane Arts Trust and the galleried upper floor becoming offices for the architectural firm <unk> Architects . 
 Frome is reputed to have one or more systems of tunnels beneath the streets of the older parts of the town . Some entrances are visible above ground ; for example in the wall at the top of Stony Street , with other entrances in the cellars of shops and houses . Their purpose and full extent remain unknown but they have been investigated in recent years by at least one local group and a documentary has been made . 
 = = Religious sites = = 
 The parish church of St John the Baptist , was built between the late 12th century and early 15th century replacing a 685 AD Saxon building . Major restoration work was carried out in the 1860s , including the construction of the Via Crucis , which is thought to be unique in an Anglican church . Outside the east end of the church is the tomb of Bishop Thomas Ken . The tower has eight bells , which bear inscriptions indicating that they were cast at various points between 1622 and 1792 . A daughter church of St John 's , Christ Church , was built in 1818 by George Allen Underwood , although considerable changes were made throughout the 19th and 20th centuries . The third Anglican Church , Holy Trinity , was built in 1837 – 38 by Henry Goodridge in the style of Commissioners ' Gothic . It is unusual in that the altar is at the west end due to the position in which the church was built . The stained glass windows are near @-@ contemporary copies of windows designed by Sir Edward Burne @-@ Jones . Finally , St Mary 's at Innox Hill was built in 1863 , by C.E. Giles , as another Chapel of Ease to St John 's . It is small with a decorated sanctuary ceiling . 
 In 1853 , <unk> Catholics ( Catholic @-@ Apostolic ) began worshipping in a building in the West End until the church was closed . The Roman Catholic church began in Frome after the building of a temporary church in Park Road in 1928 , and a new church , St Catharine 's Catholic Church , was finally built on the site in 1967 and 1968 . Rook Lane Chapel , a <unk> chapel , was in use from 1707 until 1968 . In 1773 , a split in the congregation of Rook Lane led to the establishment of another Zion Congregational Church in <unk> Lane . This building was replaced in 1810 , and was extended in 1888 ( a separate , octagonal school room with a conical roof having been built on the grounds in 1875 ) . A Quaker Meeting House existed in Sheppards Barton , now South Parade , from 1675 to 1856 . The original building was replaced around 1730 with a simple unadorned stone building comprising a single meeting room with wrought iron gallery above . The building became a school , the town library , Red Cross centre and , since 1999 , the offices of a software company . The present chapel @-@ like appearance was created in a 1993 refurbishment by the Red Cross . 
 Baptists had been worshipping in the town since 1669 , and had two churches . One was built in Sheppards Barton ( now South Parade ) in 1708 . This was demolished and replaced by a new building in 1850 , which was itself closed in 2001 . Part of this building was converted to residential use but the main church , with a baptism pool , remains disused . A second Baptist Church was built in <unk> Lane ( now Catherine Street ) in 1711 . It was replaced with a new building in 1813 , which was embellished with a Doric portico in 1845 . It closed in 1962 ( later serving as a library , before being converted into flats in the 1980s ) . The Methodist church , built in 1812 at <unk> , is still in use after considerable additions in 1863 , restoration in 1871 and major internal rearrangement in the 1980s . Sun Street Chapel was erected by the Primitive Methodists in 1834 , and closed in 1982 , although it was used by another religious group afterwards . It is now used as a Community Centre . There is another Methodist church on Portway , built in 1910 . A Dissenters ' Cemetery with Chapel at Vallis Road , was founded in 1851 by Frome 's ' Free Churches ' , mainly Baptist , Congregational and Methodist and has been the site of over 6 @,@ 000 burials .

 Abul <unk> Al @-@ Maʿarri ( Arabic أبو <unk> <unk> Abū al @-@ ʿAlāʾ al @-@ <unk> , full name أبو <unk> أحمد بن عبد الله بن سليمان <unk> <unk> Abū al @-@ ʿAlāʾ Aḥmad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn <unk> al @-@ <unk> al @-@ <unk> ; 973 – 1057 ) was a blind Arab philosopher , poet , and writer . Born in modern @-@ day Maarrat al @-@ Nuʿman , Syria , he studied at Aleppo , Tripoli and Antioch . Producing popular poems in Baghdad , he nevertheless refused to sell his texts . In 1010 , he returned to Syria after his mother began declining in health , and continued writing which gained him local respect . 
 Described as a " pessimistic freethinker " , Al @-@ Maʿarri was a controversial rationalist of his time , citing reason as the chief source of truth . He was pessimistic about life describing himself as " a double prisoner " of blindness and isolation . He attacked the dogmas of religion and rejected Islam . He was equally sarcastic towards the religions of Jews , Christians and Zoroastrians . He advocated social justice , and lived a secluded , ascetic lifestyle . He was a strict vegetarian , writing " do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals . " Al @-@ Maʿarri held an anti @-@ <unk> view , in line with his general pessimism , suggesting that children should not be born to spare them of the pains of life . 
 Al @-@ Maʿarri wrote three main works that were popular in his time . Among his works are " The Tinder Spark " , " Unnecessary Necessity " , and " The Epistle of Forgiveness " which may be considered a precursor to Dante 's Divine Comedy . Al @-@ Maʿarri never married and died at the age of 83 in the city where he was born , Maarrat al @-@ Nuʿman . In 2013 , a statue of Al @-@ Maʿarri located in Syria was beheaded by jihadists from the Al Nusra Front . Despite controversy about his unorthodox views , Al @-@ Maʿarri is regarded as one of the greatest classical Arabic poets . 
 = = Life = = 
 Abul Ala was born in Maʿarra , modern Maarrat al @-@ Nuʿman , Syria , near the city of Aleppo , in December 973 . At his time , the city was part of the Abbasid Caliphate , the third Islamic caliphate , and was during the Golden Age of Islam . He was a member of the Banu Sulayman , a notable family of Maʿarra , belonging to the larger Tanukh tribe . One of his ancestors was probably the first qadi of Maʿarra . The Tanukh tribe had formed part of the aristocracy in Syria for hundreds of years and some members of the Banu Sulayman had also been noted as good poets . 
 He lost his eyesight at the age of four due to smallpox . His later pessimism may be explained by his virtual blindness . Later in his life , he regarded himself as " a double prisoner " which referred to both this blindness and the general isolation that he felt during his life . 
 He started his career as a poet at an early age , at about 11 or 12 years old . He was educated at first in Maʿarra and Aleppo , later also in Antioch and other Syrian cities . Among his teachers in Aleppo were companions from the circle of Ibn <unk> . This grammarian and Islamic scholar had died in 980 CE when al @-@ Maʿarri was still a child . Al @-@ Maʿarri nevertheless laments the loss of Ibn <unk> in strong terms in a poem of his <unk> al @-@ <unk> . Al @-@ <unk> reports that when on his way to Tripoli , Al @-@ Maʿarri visited a Christian monastery near Latakia where he listened to debates about Hellenistic philosophy , which planted in him the seeds of his later skepticism and <unk> ; but other historians such as Ibn al @-@ Adim deny that he had been exposed to any theology other than Islamic doctrine . 
 In 1004 @-@ 5 Al @-@ Maʿarri learned that his father had died and , in reaction , wrote an elegy where he praised his father . Years later he would travel to Baghdad where he became well received in the literary salons of the time , though he was a controversial figure . After the eighteen months in Baghdad , al @-@ Maʿarri returned home for unknown reasons . He may have returned because his mother was ill , or he may have run out of money in Baghdad , as he refused to sell his works . He returned to his native town of Maʿarra in about 1010 and learned that his mother had died before his arrival . 
 He remained in Maʿarra for the rest of his life , where he opted for an ascetic lifestyle , refusing to sell his poems , living in seclusion and observing a strict vegetarian diet . His personal confinement to his house was only broken one time when violence had struck his town . Though he was confined , he lived out his later years continuing his work and collaborating with others . He enjoyed great respect and attracted many students locally , as well as actively holding correspondence with scholars abroad . Despite his intentions of living a secluded lifestyle , in his seventies , he became rich and was the most revered person in his area . Al @-@ Maʿarri never married and died in May 1057 in his hometown . 
 = = Philosophy = = 
 = = = Irreligion = = = 
 Al @-@ Maʿarri was skeptic in his beliefs who denounced superstition and dogmatism in religion . This , along with his general negative view on life , has made him described as a pessimistic freethinker . One of the recurring themes of his philosophy was the right of reason against the claims of custom , tradition , and authority . Al @-@ Maʿarri taught that religion was a " fable invented by the ancients " , worthless except for those who exploit the credulous masses . 
 Do not suppose the statements of the prophets to be true ; they are all fabrications . Men lived comfortably till they came and spoiled life . The sacred books are only such a set of idle tales as any age could have and indeed did actually produce . 
 Al @-@ Maʿarri criticized many of the dogmas of Islam , such as the Hajj , which he called " a <unk> journey . " He rejected claims of any divine revelation and his creed was that of a philosopher and ascetic , for whom reason provides a moral guide , and virtue is its own reward . 
 His religious skepticism and positively anti @-@ religious views extended beyond Islam and also toward Judaism and Christianity . Al @-@ Maʿarri remarked that monks in their cloisters or devotees in their mosques were blindly following the beliefs of their locality : if they were born among Magians or Sabians they would have become Magians or Sabians . <unk> his view on organized religion , he once stated , " The inhabitants of the earth are of two sorts : those with brains , but no religion , and those with religion , but no brains . " 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Al @-@ Maʿarri was an ascetic , renouncing worldly desires and living secluded from others while producing his works . He opposed all forms of violence . In Baghdad , while being well received , he decided not to sell his texts , which made it difficult for him to live . This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in India during his time . 
 In Al @-@ Maʿarri 's later years , he became a strict vegan , neither consuming meat , nor any other animal products . He wrote : 
 And do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals , 
 Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draught 
 for their young , not noble ladies . [ ... ] 
 I washed my hands of all this ; and wish that I 
 Perceived my way before my hair went gray ! 
 = = = Anti @-@ <unk> = = = 
 Al @-@ <unk> fundamental pessimism is expressed in his anti @-@ <unk> recommendation that no children should be begotten , so as to spare them the pains of life . In an elegy composed by him over the loss of a relative , he combines his grief with observations on the <unk> of this life : 
 <unk> your tread . Methinks the earth 's surface is but bodies of the dead , 
 Walk slowly in the air , so you do not trample on the remains of God 's servants . 
 Even on Al @-@ Maʿarri 's epitaph , he wanted it written that his life was a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself . 
 = = Modern views = = 
 Al @-@ Maʿarri is controversial even today as he was skeptical of Islam , the dominant religion of the Arab World . In 2013 , almost a thousand years after his death , the al @-@ Nusra Front , a branch of al @-@ Qaeda , beheaded a statue of Al @-@ Maʿarri during the civil war in Syria . The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad . The motive behind the beheading is disputed ; theories range from the fact that he was a heretic to the fact that he is believed by some to be related to the Assad family . 
 Still , Al @-@ Maʿarri is sometimes referred to as one of the greatest classical Arab poets . Some have drawn connections between him and the Roman poet Titus Lucretius Carus , citing how progressive their views were compared to the time in which they lived . 
 = = Works = = 
 An early collection of his poems appeared as " The Tinder Spark " ( <unk> al @-@ <unk> ; <unk> <unk> ) . The collection of poems included praise of notable people of Aleppo and the Hamdanid King Sa 'd al @-@ Dawla . It gained great popularity and established his reputation as a poet . A few poems in the collection were about armor . 
 A second , more original collection appeared under the title " Unnecessary Necessity " ( <unk> <unk> lam <unk> <unk> ما <unk> <unk> أو <unk> ) , which is how Al @-@ Maʿarri saw the business of living ; also <unk> " Necessities " , alluding to the unnecessary complexity of the rhyme scheme used . 
 His third famous work is a work of prose known as " The Epistle of Forgiveness " ( <unk> al @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . The work was written as a direct response to the Arabic poet Ibn al @-@ <unk> , whom Al @-@ Maʿarri mocks for his religious views . In this work , the poet visits paradise and meets the Arab poets of the pagan period , contrary to Muslim doctrine which holds that only those who believe in God can find salvation ( Quran 4 : 48 ) . Because of the aspect of conversing with the deceased in paradise , the <unk> Al @-@ <unk> has been compared to the Divine Comedy of Dante which came hundreds of years after . The work has also been noted to be similar to Ibn <unk> 's Risala al @-@ <unk> ' wa al @-@ <unk> though there is no evidence that Al @-@ Maʿarri was inspired by Ibn <unk> nor is there any evidence that Dante was inspired by Al @-@ Maʿarri . Algeria reportedly banned " The Epistle " from the International Book Fair held in Algiers in 2007 . 
 " Paragraphs and Periods " ( Al @-@ <unk> wa al @-@ <unk> ) is a collection of homilies . The work has also been called a parody of the Quran .

 = International Criminal Court investigation in Kenya = 
 The International Criminal Court investigation in Kenya or the situation in the Republic of Kenya is an on @-@ going investigation by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) into the responsibility for the 2007 – 2008 post @-@ election violence in Kenya . The 2007 – 2008 Kenyan crisis followed the presidential election that was held on 27 December 2007 . The Electoral Commission of Kenya officially declared that the incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was re @-@ elected ; supporters of the opposition candidate Raila Odinga accused the government of electoral fraud and rejected the results . A series of protests and demonstrations followed , and fighting — mainly along tribal lines — led to many deaths , injuries and displacements . 
 After failed attempts to conduct a criminal investigation of the key perpetrators in Kenya , the matter was referred to the International Criminal Court in The Hague . In 2010 , the Prosecutor of the ICC Luis Moreno Ocampo announced that he was seeking summonses for six people : Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta , Industrialisation Minister Henry Kosgey , Education Minister William Ruto , Cabinet Secretary Francis Muthaura , radio executive Joshua Arap Sang and former police commissioner Mohammed Hussein Ali — all accused of crimes against humanity . The six suspects , known colloquially as the " Ocampo six " were indicted by the ICC 's Pre @-@ Trial Chamber II on 8 March 2011 and summoned to appear before the Court . 
 The government of Kenya and the National Assembly both attempted to stop the ICC process . The government appealed to both the United Nations Security Council and the Court itself regarding the admissibility of the case . The National Assembly voted in favour of removing Kenya as a state party to the Rome Statute , the international treaty which established the ICC . Despite this opposition , the suspects cooperated with the proceedings and attended preliminary hearings in The Hague in April 2011 and confirmation of charges hearings in September of that year . The Pre @-@ Trial Chamber II confirmed the charges against Kenyatta , Ruto , and Sang and declined to confirm the charges against Ali , Kosgey , and Muthaura . The trial of Ruto and Sang began on 10 September 2013 , while that of Kenyatta is supposed to begin on 5 February 2014 . However the Chief <unk> has asked that the case be adjourned citing lack of enough evidence required for trial . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 27 December 2007 , a general election was held in Kenya , comprising parliamentary , presidential and civic elections . The incumbent President , Mwai Kibaki , who represents the Party of National Unity and Raila Odinga from the Orange Democratic Movement were the leading candidates . Early indications showed that Odinga was likely to win the election , however the results announced by the Electoral Commission of Kenya showed that Kibaki had been re @-@ elected and he was sworn in as President . Immediately after the Electoral Commission 's announcement , Odinga rejected the result , claiming that widespread electoral fraud had taken place . European Union electoral observers also claimed that the electoral commission had failed to ensure the credibility of the vote . 
 In the days that followed violence spread throughout the country . An estimated 1 @,@ 200 people died and more than 500 @,@ 000 were displaced from their homes . A government spokesman accused Odinga 's supporters of " engaging in ethnic cleansing " , while Odinga claimed that the President 's supporters were " guilty , directly , of genocide " . Violence was mainly perpetrated along tribal lines ; Mwai Kibaki is part of the Kikuyu tribe , the largest tribe in Kenya , while Odinga is a Luo . Violence continued until a peace deal was agreed upon between Kibaki and Odinga under the mediation of former United Nations Secretary @-@ General Kofi Annan , whereby Kibaki would remain as President and Odinga would take over the newly created office of the Prime Minister . 
 = = Waki report and referral to the ICC = = 
 As part of the mediation between Kibaki and Odinga in 2008 the two parties agreed a series of accords . One of these was to establish the Commission of Inquiry into the Post @-@ Election Violence , chaired by Kenyan judge Philip Waki to investigate the violence and particularly the actions of the police . Waki 's report recommended that the Kenyan government set up a special tribunal to prosecute those responsible for the worst <unk> and although both Kibaki and Odinga voiced support for a local tribunal , the idea was rejected by the National Assembly . Waki passed his report , including a list of the names of those he considered most responsible for the violence back to Kofi Annan with instructions that it be passed to the International Criminal Court if progress with the local tribunal was not made . On 16 July 2009 the Waki commission delivered a copy of his report along with six boxes of documents and supporting materials to the International Criminal Court along with a sealed envelope containing a list of people who could be implicated in the violence . The prosecutor , Luis Moreno Ocampo opened the envelope , inspected its contents and re @-@ sealed it . Initially the ICC gave the Kenyan government a deadline of July 2010 to establish a local tribunal before it would refer the case to the ICC Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo . The " Waki List " has so far not been made public , and there is speculation that it may contain more names than the six who were initially indicted by the ICC ; consequently there have been some calls in Kenya for either the ICC or Waki to release the list . 
 = = Pre @-@ Trial Chamber authorisation = = 
 The International Criminal Court 's prosecutor may open a formal investigation in one of three circumstances : when a situation is referred by the government of a state which the investigation concerns , when the situation is referred by the UN Security Council or under his own volition with authorisation from a Pre @-@ Trial Chamber . On 6 November 2009 the ICC Presidency assigned the situation in Kenya to Pre @-@ Trial Chamber II and the prosecutor made an application to that chamber for authorisation to open a formal investigation on 26 November . The judges of the pre @-@ trial chamber granted this authorisation on 31 March 2010 . The judges who made this decision , Ekaterina Trendafilova , Hans @-@ Peter Kaul and Cuno <unk> noted in their written ruling that while Article 15 of the Rome Statute does allow for the Prosecutor to investigate and prosecute a case of his own volition , this is one of the more controversial aspects of the ICC . In the ICC 's history , this case was the first time the Prosecutor decided to investigate a case in this manner , with all prior cases being referred to the Court either by a national government , or by the United Nations Security Council . 
 Judge Hans @-@ Peter Kaul made a dissenting opinion in the judgment , but the judgment was passed by a 2 – 1 majority . In his dissent he wrote : 
 In essence , the main reason for this position is the following : both , my interpretation of article 7 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the [ Rome ] Statute , which sets out the legal definition of " attack directed against any civilian population " as constitutive contextual element of crimes against humanity , and my examination of the Prosecutor 's Request and supporting material , including the victims ' representations , have led me to conclude that the acts which occurred on the territory of the Republic of Kenya do not qualify as crimes against humanity falling under the jurisdictional ambit of the Court . 
 = = Suspects = = 
 On 15 December 2010 , Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo named six suspects , and made an application to Pre @-@ Trial Chamber II for summonses to be issued to them . The six men became colloquially known as the Ocampo Six ( or Ocampo 6 ) . The individuals named by Moreno Ocampo were : 
 Major General Mohammed Hussein Ali – the chief executive of the Postal Corporation of Kenya , who at the time of the post @-@ election violence had been the Commissioner of the Kenya Police . 
 Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta – the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance who is also chairman of the <unk> political party which is part of President Kibaki 's Party of National Unity . 
 Henry <unk> Kosgey – the Minister for Industrialisation and member of the National Assembly for the <unk> Constituency who is also chairman of the Orange Democratic Movement . 
 Francis <unk> Muthaura – the Head of Public Service , Cabinet Secretary and chairman of the National Security Advisory Committee . 
 William <unk> Ruto – the Minister for Higher Education , Science and Technology and ODM member of the National Assembly for the Eldoret North Constituency . 
 Joshua Arap Sang – the head of operations at the Kalenjin language radio station <unk> FM , who at the time of the post @-@ election violence was a radio presenter . 
 = = = Legal representation = = = 
 It was reported in 2011 that Kenyatta has recruited British lawyers Steven Kay and Gillian Higgins , who previously defended Slobodan Milosevic at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , to lead his legal team . Francis Muthaura initially appointed another British lawyer , Karim Ahmad Khan , who previously led the defence of Charles Taylor at the Special Court for Sierra Leone , and subsequently also recruited Essa <unk> and <unk> <unk> who both formerly worked in the ICC Prosecutor 's office . Ali 's defence was led by Canadian John Philpot , Kosgey 's by Julius <unk> , and William Ruto appointed Dr. <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> is also representing Joshua Sang . The Kenyan government has agreed to pay the legal costs of Francis Muthaura and Mohamed Ali due to their actions being taken in the course of their public employment . This decision has attracted criticism from many Kenyans . 
 = = Charges = = 
 The prosecutor presented the charges to Pre @-@ Trial Chamber II as two separate cases , one case was the prosecution of Ali , Kenyatta , and Mathaura , and the second case is the prosecution of Kosgey , Ruto , and Sang . All six suspects were accused of crimes against humanity .

 In the case which concerns the Orange Democratic Movement 's supporters ' actions against the supporters of the government , William Ruto , Henry Kosgey , and Joshua Sang were charged with four counts of crimes against humanity . They were all accused of committing the crimes as indirect co @-@ perpetrators at locations including Turbo town , the greater Eldoret area , Kapsabet town , and Nandi Hills town . Their charges were : 
 Murder , constituting a crime against humanity in violation of article 7 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Rome Statute ;

 = = Pre @-@ trial phase = = 
 Pre @-@ Trial Chamber II ruled that there were reasonable grounds to be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally responsible as indirect co @-@ perpetrators of the crimes outlined in counts 1 , 2 and 4 , but in the case of Joshua Sang it ruled that his involvement was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so only ruled that there were grounds to believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes . The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3 . In the case of Kenyatta , Muthaura and Ali the Chamber ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were guilty as indirect co @-@ perpetrators of the crimes of which they were accused but in the case of Mohammed Ali , the Chamber ruled that his contribution was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so he was charged with having otherwise contributed . 
 On 8 March 2011 , Pre @-@ Trial Chamber II issued summonses to appear for all six of the suspects in the two cases . As with the decision to authorise the investigation by the Prosecutor , Judge Hans @-@ Peter Kaul dissented and opposed the issuance of summonses . 
 = = = Initial hearings = = = 
 On 7 April 2011 , the initial hearing took place in the case of Ruto , Kosgey , and Sang , and the following day the corresponding hearing in the case of Kenyatta , Ali , and Mathaura also took place at the seat of the Court in The Hague . During the hearing , presiding Judge Ekaterina Trendafilova expressed concern at some of the actions of the suspects , in particular speeches that may have been made in an attempt to incite further violence in Kenya . Speaking at the initial hearing she said : 
 It came to the knowledge of the Chamber by way of following some articles in the Kenyan newspapers that there are some movements towards <unk> the violence in the country by way of using some dangerous speeches . I would like to remind the suspects – and I 'm not referring to anyone in particular but this is a general point to be made to all the suspects – that such type of action could be perceived as a sort of inducement which may constitute the breach of one of the conditions set out in the summonses to appear , namely , to continue committing crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court . Accordingly , this might prompt the Chamber to replace the summonses to appear with warrants of arrest . 
 At the initial hearings the chamber set dates for the confirmation of charges hearings to take place in September 2011 . An application by the Office of the Prosecutor to impose conditions on the suspects ' summonses including that they provide details of all their home addresses and that they pay a bond to the Court was rejected by Judge Trendafilova . 
 = = = Location of confirmation of charges hearings = = = 
 In June 2011 , Pre @-@ Trial Chamber II requested that the Prosecutor , defendants , and victims comment on the possibility of holding the confirmation of charges hearings in Kenya rather than in The Hague . This move was supported by Amnesty International , which claimed that holding the hearings in Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims . The idea of holding the hearings in Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey , with Mathaura suggesting holding the hearings in a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting the possibility of holding the hearings in Arusha , Tanzania , which is the location of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda . The move was opposed by the Prosecution , who cited security concerns as an obstacle , and also by Ali , Kenyatta , Ruto , and Sang who cited the possibility that a change of venue would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court . On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that the hearings will take place at the seat of the Court in The Hague . 
 = = = Confirmation of Charges Hearings = = = 
 The hearing in the case of Ruto , Kosgey and Sang took place in The Hague between 1 and 8 September 2011 . The three defendants had all filed applications challenging the jurisdiction of the court which were rejected by the chamber . Although the defence teams had initially proposed calling 43 witnesses to the confirmation of charges hearings the chamber instructed them to present just two witnesses each at the confirmation hearings , which they did . Ruto and Sang additionally made unsworn statements in person . 
 The hearing in the case of Muthaura , Kenyatta and Ali took place between 21 September and 5 October 2011 . Kenyatta and Ali submitted challenges to the court 's jurisdiction which were rejected . The defence teams presented two witnesses each and Kenyatta made a sworn statement . Francis Muthaura exercised his right to make an unsworn statement . 
 = = Participation of victims = = 
 The procedures of the ICC allow for the participation of victims who may submit views and observations to the Court and also apply for reparations . In the case of Ruto et al . 394 victims applied to participate in the proceedings and the pre @-@ trial chamber admitted 327 of those victims as participants . In the case of Muthaura et al . 249 victims applied and 233 were admitted as participants .

 = = = Ruto et al = = = 
 The prosecutor accused the defendants of forming an organisation along with other Kalenjin people as early as 2006 with the stated purpose of removing members of the Kikuyu , Kamba and <unk> ethnic groups from the Rift Valley region of Kenya to create a large pro @-@ ODM power base in that region . To force these communities to relocate , the group planned to inflict fear and destroy homes and property until the victims left the region . 
 The prosecutor alleged that on 15 April 2007 a ceremony took place at a milk plant in Molo where members of the network swore an oath of allegiance and that further meetings took place , including some which took place at William Ruto 's house . In particular the prosecutor claims that a meeting took place on 22 December 2007 at Ruto 's house and that guns and money were distributed to the attendees . 
 Sang , who at the time of the election was the presenter of a radio programme on the Kalenjin language station <unk> FM was accused of using his broadcasts to spread instructions and <unk> to violence . 
 = = = = Murder = = = = 
 The charge of murder as a crime against humanity was made by the prosecutor in relation to multiple attacks that took place in the aftermath of the election . The prosecution alleges that members of the network attacked Turbo town on 30 and 31 December 2007 , resulting in at least 4 deaths and with one witness claiming that he saw more than 200 dead bodies . Additionally the prosecutor alleges that network members attacked the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> areas of Eldoret , resulting in 70 to 87 deaths . It is alleged that during the attack in <unk> several people took refuge in a church which was locked from outside and then burned down causing between 17 and 35 people to be burned to death . Additionally the prosecutor alleges that the towns of Kapsabet and Nandi Hills town were attacked by network members . 
 = = = = Forcible Transfer of Population = = = = 
 The prosecutor claims that the network forced residents of Turbo , Eldoret , Kapsabet and Nandi Hills to leave these areas by destroying homes and that in Turbo town homes and businesses were burned with petrol . Many residents fled to police stations and at one point 7 @,@ 500 displaced people were sheltering at Kapsabet police station alone . 
 = = = = Persecution = = = = 
 The crime of persecution as a crime against humanity is defined under the Rome Statute as " the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity . The prosecutor claims that since the crimes of murder and forcible transfer of population were done against specific ethnic groups which were identified as supporters of the PNU , these crimes amount to persecution . 
 = = = Muthaura et al = = = 
 The prosecutor alleges that Muthaura , Ali , Kenyatta and the leadership of the outlawed Mungiki sect " agreed to pursue an organizational policy to keep the PNU in power through every means necessary , including by orchestrating a police failure to prevent the commission of crimes " . He claims that prior to the election Uhuru Kenyatta was the mediator between the PNU and the Mungiki and organised a series of meetings from November 2007 involving Muthaura , other government officials , businessmen and Mungiki leaders . Kenyatta and Muthaura are accused of providing funding , uniforms and weapons to Mungiki and pro @-@ PNU youth to carry out their attacks . Muthaura , as chairman of the National Security Committee , and Ali as commissioner of police are accused of instructing the Kenya Police not to intervene in the attacks . 
 The prosecutor claims that in preparation for the post @-@ election violence a meeting took place at the State House in Nairobi on 26 November 2007 between Muthaura , Kenyatta , Mungiki representatives and President Kibaki . During this meeting it is alleged by the anonymous " Witness 4 " , one of the Mungiki representatives present at the meeting that Francis Muthaura gave money to the Mungiki representatives . At a second meeting , held on 30 December Kenyatta is accused of giving some MPs and Mungiki coordinators 3 @.@ 3 million Kenyan shillings each ( approximately $ 35 @,@ 000 ) with which to buy guns to attack Nakuru . In late January 2008 , before the crimes in Naivasha , the Mungiki leader <unk> <unk> was allegedly given 20 million shillings and that in return for that money and other concessions <unk> placed the Mungiki at the disposal of Muthaura and Kenyatta . 
 = = = = Murder = = = = 
 The prosecutor alleges that murder as a crime against humanity took place in Nakuru and Naivasha . He alleges that that approximately 112 people were killed in Nakuru between 24 and 27 January 2008 and that by 31 January at least 50 people had been killed in Naivasha . One witness testified that 23 people died in Naivasha from burns including 19 who died in a single arson attack on the <unk> estate . The majority of the killings were the result of attacks with machetes and blunt instruments although guns were used in some attacks . 
 = = = = Forcible Transfer of Population = = = = 
 The prosecution alleges that thousands of ODM supporters were forced to leave their homes in Nakuru and Naivasha . In particular 9 @,@ 000 people took refuge at Naivasha police station and in Nakuru many took refuge at the <unk> stadium . It is claimed that public announcements of " <unk> must leave " were made in these areas . The people displaced were mainly from the Luo , Luhya and Kalenjin ethnic groups . 
 = = = = Rape and other forms of sexual violence = = = = 
 The prosecutor alleges than in Nakuru forty five cases of sexual violence were reported including rapes , forced male circumcisions and penile amputation . Rapes were also reported in Naivasha , as were forced circumcisions of Luo men . One witness claims that Naivasha 's men were forced to remove their underwear to confirm their ethnicity and forcibly circumcised if their uncircumcised penis identified them as Luo . 
 = = = = Persecution and Other inhumane acts = = = = 
 In relation to the charges of persecution and other inhumane acts the prosecutor cites the physical violence and destruction of property that was committed by the Mungiki members against the ODM supporters as being " other inhumane acts " which constitute crimes against humanity . Since these acts were targeted at people who were believed to support the Orange Democratic Movement or who were part of the Luo , Luhya and Kalenjin ethnic groups the prosecutor further claims that these crimes meet the definition of persecution as a crime against humanity . 
 = = Confirmation of Charges = = 
 The outcomes of the confirmation of charges hearings were announced on 23 January 2012 . Despite the ICC regulations requiring the Pre @-@ Trial Chamber to normally issue a verdict on confirmation of charges within sixty days of the hearings taking place the chamber issued a ruling on 26 October 2011 to vary this time limit to allow both the results in both cases to be announced simultaneously . The chamber ruled by majority ( with judge Kaul dissenting ) to confirm all of the charges against William Ruto and Joshua Arap Sang , to confirm all of the charges with the exception of " other forms of sexual violence " against Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura and to decline to confirm the charges against Mohammed Hussein Ali and Henry Kosgey . 
 = = = Hans @-@ Peter Kaul 's dissent = = = 
 Judge Kaul issued a dissenting opinion in both cases . In these opinions he asserted that he continues to believe that the ICC lacks jurisdiction ratione <unk> over the situation in Kenya . His assertion was that the although crimes were committed they were not of a nature which constitute crimes against humanity within the jurisdiction of the ICC . This was the third time that Judge Kaul wrote a similar dissent opposing the prosecutions . 
 = = Effect on the Suspects = = 
 Following the confirmation of charges Orange Democratic Movement legislators petitioned the president to dismiss Kenyatta and Muthaura from their posts . They cited an agreement signed by Kibaki as part of the implementation of the Waki Commission 's report in December 2008 which states " The parties shall ensure that any person holding public office or any public servant charged with a criminal offence related to 2008 post @-@ election violence shall be suspended from duty until the matter is fully adjudicated upon " . Kenyan Attorney @-@ General <unk> Muigai issued a statement that the pair would not be required to vacate office until their appeals against the confirmation are concluded , however Kenyatta and Muthaura both resigned their posts of Finance Minister and Cabinet Secretary respectively on 26 January . Kenyatta will however retain his position of Deputy Prime Minister . 
 Both Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto declared their candidacies for the 2013 Kenyan presidential elections . 
 = = Response within Kenya = = 
 On 22 December 2010 , a week after the ICC Prosecutor announced the individuals he was seeking to prosecute , the Kenyan National Assembly passed a motion seeking to withdraw Kenya as a State Party to the Rome Statute , the treaty which established the International Criminal Court . The motion , which was introduced by Assembly Member Isaac Ruto had previously been thrown out of the National Assembly by Deputy Speaker Farah <unk> who ruled it was unconstitutional ; however an amended version was introduced the following day and passed . During the debate , the Minister for Energy <unk> <unk> claimed the ICC was a colonialist , imperialist court . This motion did not itself affect Kenya 's status as a State Party to the Rome Statute , but rather obliges ministers to move to repeal Kenya 's International Crimes Act which ratified the Rome Statute and made necessarily changes to Kenyan 's criminal code . In February 2011 , Kenya appealed to the United Nations Security Council , asking it to defer the trials at The Hague . Some critics in Kenya have also questioned the constitutionality of the Rome Statute , arguing that it is incompatible with the Constitution of Kenya , which was passed by a referendum in 2010 . 
 The Kenyan government 's attempt to defer the cases at the ICC by appealing to members of the UN Security Council failed without being voted on , however the government , represented by British lawyers Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon , have subsequently applied directly to the Court . The Kenyan government 's application to Pre @-@ Trial Chamber II that the two cases were inadmissible was rejected unanimously by the judges . Many victims of the post @-@ election violence voiced opposition to the government 's stance , and a poll of Kenyans conducted by <unk> shortly after Moreno Ocampo 's announcement that he intended to seek summonses showed that sixty percent of Kenyans supported the trial of the accused taking place in The Hague . 
 = = International response = = 
 Following Moreno Ocampo 's initial announcement of his intention to bring prosecutions against the six suspects , the US President Barack Obama called upon Kenya to co @-@ operate with the ICC . In a statement he said : 
 I urge all of Kenya 's leaders , and the people whom they serve , to cooperate fully with the ICC investigation and remain focused on implementation of the reform agenda and the future of your nation . Those found responsible will be held accountable for their crimes as individuals . No community should be singled out for shame or held collectively responsible . Let the accused carry their own burdens – and let us keep in mind that under the ICC process they are innocent until proven guilty . As you move forward , Kenyans can count on the United States as a friend and partner . 
 The African Union endorsed the position of the Kenyan government in seeking to delay or postpone the ICC proceedings . As of 2011 , all of the formal investigations which have been put before the International Criminal Court have concerned African countries , and only African defendants have been indicted . This has led to some resentment within Africa that the Court is targeting Africa unfairly . In particular the African Union has cited this geographical imbalance of ICC investigations in its decisions not to co @-@ operate in the proceedings against Sudanese President Omar al @-@ Bashir and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . The ICC Deputy Prosecutor <unk> <unk> denied that the ICC or its prosecutors are discriminatory , speaking in Côte d 'Ivoire she said : 
 Anytime I hear this about ICC targeting Africa , ICC doing double justice , it saddens me , especially as an African woman , also knowing that these conflicts , most of these conflicts are happening on the continent of Africa

 A three @-@ time minor league All @-@ Star game selection , Baseball America selected Heyward as the Braves ' top overall prospect in 2007 and the organization 's best power hitter ; it cited Heyward as having the best strike zone discipline and excelling at multiple other skills . In 2009 , he won a Minor League Player of the Year Award from both Baseball America and USA Today . That year , he batted .323 with 17 home runs ( HR ) , 63 runs batted in ( RBI ) , a .408 on @-@ base percentage , and a .555 slugging percentage over 99 games . A consensus number @-@ one MLB prospect entering the 2010 season , Baseball America , Keith Law of ESPN.com , and Jonathan Mayo of MLB.com all listed Heyward as baseball 's top prospect . 
 After making his MLB debut for Atlanta in 2010 , Heyward was named to the National League ( NL ) All @-@ Star team and finished second in the NL Rookie of the Year Award . Baseball America named him their MLB Rookie of the Year . Injuries limited his playing time in 2011 and 2013 .

 The son of Dartmouth graduates , Jason Heyward was born in Ridgewood , New Jersey . His father , Eugene , is from South Carolina , and mother , Laura , is from New York City ; they met at Dartmouth . Eugene played basketball and majored in engineering and Laura studied French . Eugene 's uncle , Kenny Washington , played basketball for two John Wooden @-@ led NCAA championship UCLA teams in 1964 and 1965 . Jason has one younger brother , Jacob , who attends the University of Miami and plans to major within the school of communication and also plays baseball for the Hurricanes . 
 The <unk> moved to the Atlanta metropolitan area soon after he was born . Jason played and showed marked ability in baseball from an early age . Before he turned 10 , he played for a national championship . In fact , Eugene helped fuel both of his sons ' passion for baseball . He dedicated himself to driving them to every tournament and competition possible in the family Chevrolet Suburban , which saw hundreds of thousands of miles between the events and his 90 @-@ minute work commute to and from Robins Air Force Base to the south in Houston County . 
 While his father emphasized that working hard and approaching the game with discipline were important , it was to be – above all – fun . Heyward maintained this same approach throughout his youth and professional career . One tournament in which he played was the renowned East Cobb Baseball program , where was a standout , and has produced other major league players . Heyward attended Henry County High School in McDonough near Atlanta . Heyward briefly played basketball in his youth , but concentrated exclusively on baseball in high school after his father 's urging . In February 2010 , an Associated Press reporter learned from a varsity coach that Heyward 's early batting practice exploits proved fatal to an oak tree in deep center field at the high school playing field . 
 Facing off against future Major League Baseball ( MLB ) catcher Buster Posey of Lee County High in the Georgia Class AAAA baseball championship during Heyward 's sophomore year , Henry County won two of the best @-@ of @-@ three series . Posey was actually the starting pitcher in the first game as Henry Country prevailed , 2 – 1 . Heyward hit a game @-@ tying 400 feet ( 120 m ) home run in Game 2 to cap an eight @-@ run comeback , but Lee County prevailed 14 – 10 . The next game , Heyward 's three @-@ run single proved the game and series winner in a 16 – 14 outcome . During his junior season , he again helped lead the Henry County High Warhawks to the state championship . As a senior , he batted .520 with eight home runs ( HR ) and 29 runs batted in ( RBI ) . 
 One of Heyward 's close friends and teammates from the 2005 AAAA Georgia state championship team , Andrew Wilmot , died in a traffic collision while attending college . Wilmot was a catcher who wore the uniform number 22 , the number Heyward would later wear in his major league career to honor him . Wilmot 's mother , <unk> Ruston , was Heyward 's high school literature teacher in his senior year . 
 Numerous colleges showed interest and recruited Heyward , including UCLA , which offered a full @-@ ride scholarship due in part to the family connection . Heyward was also especially interested in Clemson and Georgia Tech . Concurrently , the hometown Atlanta Braves had followed and scouted him for years , while attempting to conceal their excitement . They made him the 14th overall selection in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft . Despite signing a National Letter of Intent with UCLA , Heyward chose professional baseball over college and signed a contract with them worth $ 1 @.@ 7 million – $ 170 @,@ 000 more than MLB 's slot recommendation of $ 1 @.@ 53 million on the following August 12 . It was the same as the 2006 14th @-@ slot amount that the Toronto Blue Jays gave Travis Snider .

He ranked in the top ten in the organization in many offensive categories including second in runs , third in average , HR and OPS , sixth in hits ( 117 ) and RBI and tied for seventh in doubles ( 25 ) . He displayed consistent hitting ability against both RHP and LHP . In 2009 , Heyward hit .339 in 112 AB against LHP and .316 against RHP . In his minor league career through 2009 , he had batted .335 with six HR against LHP and .313 with 23 HR against RHP . 
 That September , both Baseball America and USA Today named him their Minor League Player of the Year . A consensus number @-@ one MLB prospect entering the 2010 season , Baseball America , Keith Law of ESPN.com and Jonathan Mayo of MLB.com each listed Heyward as baseball 's top prospect ; BA ranked him ahead of Stephen Strasburg and Giancarlo Stanton . Further , Baseball America tabbed him the # 1 prospect in both the Southern and Carolina Leagues , the Best Batting Prospect in all of Double @-@ A and the Most Exciting Player in Single @-@ A. He won the Braves ' organization Hank Aaron Award ( not to be confused with MLB 's Hank Aaron Award ) , conferred annually to the top offensive player in the Braves organization . 
 During his first three years in the minor leagues , Baseball America also ranked parts of Heyward 's skill sets as the best among Braves minor leaguers , including Best Strike Zone Discipline ( three times ) , Best Hitter for Average ( twice ) , Best Hitter for Power ( once ) , Best Defensive Outfielder ( once ) , and Best Outfield Arm ( once ) . The Braves added Heyward to their 40 @-@ man roster before the 2010 season .

 After a rapid ascent through the minor leagues , the Braves invited Heyward to spring training in March 2010 . There , his hitting continued to draw notice , as he routinely hit " rockets " all over the field and over the fences , compelling manager Bobby Cox to make him a regular in the lineup . He mentioned that he heard a different , more pronounced sound , of the balls hit off Heyward 's bat . Reggie Jackson , a New York Yankees special assistant , concurred , characterizing that sound as " stereo " , while everyone else was " in AM . " Heyward hit two notable batting practice home runs at the Champion Stadium training complex in the Lake Buena Vista , Florida . One damaged a Coca @-@ Cola truck in the parking lot , and another broke the sunroof of Atlanta Braves ' assistant general manager Bruce <unk> 's car . He was initially issued uniform number 71 . At the end of spring training , he asked the team for , and received , number 22 . He presented one of his jerseys with the number 22 to Ruston to show that he honored her son , which elicited an emotional reaction from her . 
 By now one of the most anticipated prospects in all baseball , shirts depicting his nickname , " The J @-@ Hey Kid " , were in high demand before he even played his first official major league game . Fans and pundits prognosticated on a future Hall of Fame career , eliciting comparisons to former greats such as Darryl Strawberry , Willie McCovey and Willie Mays , among many others . In fact , " The J @-@ Hey Kid " was drawn from Mays ' own nickname , " The Say Hey Kid . " On March 26 , after leading the club in on @-@ base and slugging percentages in spring training , the Braves named Heyward their starting right fielder . 
 Eugene Heyward purchased 60 tickets in advance of his son 's MLB debut on April 5 against the Chicago Cubs . Wearing Heyward 's # 22 jersey , Ruston was also in attendance for the game . During his first MLB plate appearance – and first swing at an MLB pitch – Heyward hit a three @-@ run home run , estimated at 471 feet ( 144 m ) , off starter Carlos Zambrano . The ball landed near the right field seats where Ruston was sitting . Heyward became the fifth player in Braves history to hit a home run in his first major league at bat , and the eleventh in franchise history to do so in his MLB debut , on the heels of Jordan Schafer , who did it the previous year . 
 Through Atlanta 's first 50 games , Heyward robustly lived up to the hype , hitting 10 home runs while batting .301 with a .421 OBP and .596 slugging percentage . He was named the National League ( NL ) Rookie of the Month in both April and May . However , after sustaining a thumb injury while sliding in May , he missed playing time . After he returned later in the season , his performance declined , and consistency was elusive . He was selected as a starter for the NL All @-@ Star team , but did not participate due to the thumb injury . 
 After stealing home in a double steal against the Washington Nationals in the first inning on July 28 , he became the first Brave to do so since Rafael Furcal , who did it more than ten years earlier . A 16 – 5 victory over the Cubs on August featured Heyward 's first MLB multi @-@ home run game and career highs in hits and runs scored with four each . In the final 112 games of the season , Heyward batted .266 with a .381 OBP and .396 SLG . His postseason debut was on October 7 in the National League Division Series ( NLDS ) against the San Francisco Giants . Heyward was hitless in three at bats with two strikeouts . After he collected just two hits in the series , San Francisco eliminated Atlanta on their way to winning the World Series . 
 Heyward finished his first major league season with a .277 batting average , .393 on @-@ base percentage , 18 HR , 29 doubles , 91 bases on balls , and 83 runs scored in 142 regular season games . He ranked fourth overall in the NL in OBP and walks . His longest streak of reaching base was 36 consecutive games . At the time , his OBP was the second @-@ highest in major league history for a rookie aged 20 years or younger , after Ted Williams and before Frank Robinson , and OPS of <unk> placed 30th in all MLB history counting rookie seasons . The recipient of several major awards , Heyward was named the Sporting News NL Rookie of the Year , Baseball America 's MLB Rookie of the Year , an outfielder on the magazine 's All @-@ Rookie Team , and to Topps ' Major League Rookie All @-@ Star Team . He finished second to Posey for the NL Rookie of the Year award and 20th in the NL Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) award balloting . 
 = = = = 2011 = = = = 
 Heyward 's second MLB season commenced in a fashion that reprised the high expectations from his rookie season , but injuries ultimately factored into a lengthy and dramatic slump . In the spring , he was diagnosed with a degenerative condition in his lower back . Like his first MLB at @-@ bat , he began with a home run in his first at @-@ bat of the season on March 31 , off Nationals pitcher Liván Hernández . He became just the second player , after Kazuo Matsui , to homer in his first major league at @-@ bat on opening day , and do the same the following year . Since being drafted in 2007 , it was also the third time Heyward homered in his first game of the season . 
 In a back @-@ and @-@ forth game with the Giants on April 24 , he hit a go @-@ ahead home run off relief pitcher Jeremy Affeldt in a 9 – 6 , ten @-@ inning victory . In the final eight games of the month , he hit .400 with three home runs and a .714 slugging percentage . For the month of April , Heyward hit seven HR with an <unk> OPS . Having previously been represented by Victor Menocal from Career Sports Entertainment ( CSE ) until Menocal resigned from CSE , news emerged on May 6 that Heyward switched his agent to Casey Close . 
 From the beginning of spring training , Heyward endured lingering shoulder soreness . After collecting just four hits in 41 at bats in May , the Braves performed a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan on May 12 which revealed an inflamed rotator cuff but no structural damage . He rested and received a cortisone injection , but aggravated the injury days later during batting practice . The Braves placed him on the disabled list ( DL ) on May 22 . Public criticism from teammate Chipper Jones for not playing through his injuries followed the next month . Said Jones , " I think where Jason might have erred was the comment that he made , ' I 'm not coming back until it doesn 't hurt anymore . ' ... What Jason needs to realize is that Jason at 80 percent is a force , and Jason at 80 percent is better than a lot of people in this league . " Jones later explained that he reassured Heyward in a phone call that he did not intend to misrepresent Heyward 's efforts to rehabilitate . 
 Heyward returned from the DL with increased difficulty to drive the ball while batting . A sixth @-@ inning home run against the Baltimore Orioles on July 1 was Heyward 's first since April 29 against the St. Louis Cardinals , a span of 104 at @-@ bats . However , he hit just four home runs from the end of April through August 11 . Further , his walk rate declined from 14 @.@ 6 percent the year before to 10 @.@ 7 percent . His line drive rate in that time dropped from 17 @.@ 8 to 13 percent and one @-@ quarter of his balls hit in the air were infield pop @-@ ups , compared with eight percent the year before . During a game against the Chicago Cubs on August 23 , he hit his first career grand slam . 
 Through the end of August , the Braves were the NL wild card leader . However , the Cardinals overcame a 10 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ game deficit for the wild card position by winning 20 of their final 28 to eliminate the Braves from the playoffs on the final day , consummating one of the epic late @-@ season collapses in MLB history . After battling a shoulder injury from the beginning of the season , Heyward 's overall performance dropped off from his rookie season . His batting average dropped 50 points to .227 ; his other contributions , also in decline , included 14 HR , 42 RBI , 18 doubles , and nine stolen bases in 128 games . He batted .240 against right @-@ handed pitchers , compared with .192 against left @-@ handers . 
 = = = = 2012 = = = = 
 To remedy the decline in performance from the season before , Heyward took extra steps in his preseason preparation . He streamlined his swing to mitigate bad habits incorporated after the shoulder injury . He modified his diet to include more fruits , chicken , and fish . Further , he participated in physical therapy to strengthen the shoulder and worked for a leaner weight , dropping from 256 pounds ( 116 kg ) to 235 pounds ( 107 kg ) . He started the 2012 season slowly . However , his bases loaded double on May 13 off Lance Lynn proved the game @-@ winning run as the Braves triumphed over the Cardinals , 7 – 4 . 
 With a .233 batting average through May , his production increased in June . His first multi @-@ HR game of the season , and second of his career , on June 7 helped secure an 8 – 2 victory over the Marlins . That month , he batted .353 with six HR and a 1 @.@ 080 OPS . He also registered four outfield assists , including one that put Mark Teixeira out at home plate on June 19 , preserving a 4 – 3 win over the New York Yankees . 
 The following game , also at Yankee Stadium , he launched two home runs for his third career – and second of the season – multi @-@ HR game . It was a contest that featured nine home runs between the two clubs , tying a Yankee Stadium record , including the original incarnation built in 1923 . That same week , ending June 24 , he won his first NL Player of the Week Award . In six interleague games , he batted a league @-@ leading <unk> ( 12 @-@ for @-@ 23 ) and 1 @.@ 130 slugging percentage . Further , his three HR , 12 hits , 26 total bases , and nine runs scored each tied for the league lead . He also added three multi @-@ hit games and five RBI . 
 In a 12 @-@ game hitting streak that spanned from June 13 – 27 , Heyward batted .455 ( 20 @-@ for @-@ 44 ) and homered four times . One hit during that streak was a single on June 16 against the Baltimore Orioles that ended Jason Hammel 's no @-@ hit bid in the seventh inning to leave him a one @-@ hit complete game shutout in the Orioles ' 5 – 0 victory . Heyward 's home run in an 8 – 2 defeat of the Marlins on July 30 helped end Atlanta 's streak of 16 losses on Mondays . 
 After the season , Heyward captured his first career defensive awards for right fielders : the singular MLB Fielding Bible Award , and his first NL Rawlings Gold Glove Award . In 158 games , his batting statistics included a .269 average with career highs of 27 HR , 82 RBI , 93 runs scored , 158 hits , 30 doubles , six triples , <unk> slugging percentage and 21 SB . He batted .300 ( 105 @-@ for @-@ 350 ) with 20 HR against right @-@ handers but just .224 ( 53 @-@ for @-@ 237 ) against left @-@ handers . It was the second time he received consideration in the NL MVP balloting , finishing tied for 28th . 
 = = = = 2013 = = = = 
 On January 18 , 2013 , the Braves avoided arbitration with Heyward in his first time eligible , agreeing on a one @-@ year , $ 3 @.@ 65 million deal . He was counted on as a component in the outfield including newly acquired brothers Justin and B. J. Upton , with whom he would play alongside until being traded after the 2014 season . An appendectomy on April 22 led him to being placed on the 15 @-@ day disabled list . In his first 31 games of the season , he batted <unk> ( 15 @-@ for @-@ 106 ) with two home runs and eight RBI . He returned from the appendectomy on May 17 , going 2 @-@ for @-@ 4 in an 8 – 5 win against the Dodgers . His first multi @-@ HR game of the season came against San Diego on June 10 . 
 In 37 games following the All @-@ Star break , Heyward batted .305 with on OBP of .397 and OPS of <unk> . He collected 40 hits in 131 at bats with nine doubles , seven home runs and 17 RBI . During a 19 @-@ game stretch from July 28 to August 17 , he batted .400 ( 30 @-@ for @-@ 75 ) with a <unk> OBP , six doubles , five HR – four as a leadoff hitter – 15 RBI , eight BB and 23 runs scored . On August 17 , he hit his second multi @-@ HR game of the season against Washington . In the month of August , his .348 batting average ( 23 hits in 66 AB ) ranked tenth in the NL . 
 New York Mets pitcher Jon Niese hit Heyward in the face with a pitch on August 21 , fracturing his jaw in two places . He had surgery , which required the insertion of two plates , and returned on September 20 . Heyward began wearing a protective shield attached to the right side of his batting helmet . He struck out and walked in a 9 – 5 win against the Chicago Cubs . 
 Six days later , Heyward set career highs against Philadelphia with five hits , four extra @-@ base hits , and matched a career @-@ best three doubles . He also hit his third career – and second of the season – leadoff HR . In his last 31 games of the season , starting July 28 , he hit at a .333 ( 38 @-@ for @-@ 114 ) clip . He batted .322 ( 38 @-@ for @-@ 118 ) with a .403 OBP in 30 games as a leadoff hitter . After two stints on the DL , Heyward appeared in 104 total games , batting .254 with 14 HR , 22 2B , 38 RBI , 67 runs scored and two stolen bases . The Braves record was 71 – 33 in the games in which he appeared . 
 = = = = 2014 = = = = 
 The Braves bought out Heyward 's last arbitration @-@ eligible years on February 4 , 2014 , agreeing on a two @-@ year , $ 13 @.@ 3 million contract . Already rated one of the top defensive outfielders in the league , his coverage in right field significantly improved , demonstrated through an increased defensive runs saved ( DRS ) total . Through May 19 , he registered 16 DRS , matching three of his previous four entire season totals . Inside Edge ( IE ) charted that of all batted balls hit to him , Heyward had missed a total of nine in 358 innings ; all nine were rated as having a 10 % or lower chance of being caught . Two catches in motion off the bat of Mike Trout – one tumbling on a sinking line drive and one sprinting and leaping at the warning track – helped ensure a 7 – 3 victory over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on June 15 . Heyward also added a home run . 
 Playing as the Braves ' primary leadoff hitter , he played in 149 games and finished with a .271 batting average , .351 on @-@ base percentage , 74 runs scored , 11 HR , 58 RBI and 20 stolen bases . Caught stealing just four times , his 83 @.@ 33 % success rate placed seventh in the NL . Defensively , Heyward registered a standout season . In 149 games in right field , he led the NL at his position in putouts ( 365 ) , assists ( nine ) , range factor per nine innings ( 2 @.@ 56 ) and game ( 2 @.@ 51 ) , fielding percentage ( <unk> ) , and total zone runs ( 30 ) . Among all NL outfielders , he was fifth in assists , third in range factor per game and second in putouts and fielding percentage . 
 Further , per Baseball @-@ Reference.com , Heyward registered fourth in the league with 2 @.@ 8 defensive wins above replacement ( <unk> ) and led all MLB players with 32 total DRS . He saved 40 bases on deep @-@ hit balls , which was the highest output of his career and led all MLB outfielders . Accordingly , Heyward was the recipient of a number of awards , including his second of both the Rawlings NL Gold Glove Award and of the Fielding Bible Award for all MLB right fielders , the latter of which he won unanimously . Wilson Sporting Goods named him their MLB right field Defensive Player of the Year and overall MLB Defensive Player of the Year .

 On November 17 , 2014 , the Braves traded Heyward to the St. Louis Cardinals along with pitcher Jordan Walden for pitchers Shelby Miller and Tyrell Jenkins to replace their former right fielder and top prospect Oscar Taveras , who died in a car accident a month earlier . Cardinals manager Mike Matheny , who wore uniform # 22 and had also done so for most of his playing career , gave his number to Heyward . Heyward wears this number to honor his friend Andrew Wilmot . After the trade was announced , Heyward published a Twitter message thanking the Atlanta Braves organization and fans for their support . 
 Five years to the day of his MLB debut , Heyward appeared in his first game as a Cardinal against the Chicago Cubs on April 5 , 2015 . He garnered three hits , including two doubles and a stolen base in a 3 – 0 victory . His first home run as a Cardinals player was on April 18 against the Cincinnati Reds at Busch Stadium with a 5 – 2 win . After uncharacteristic errors in both of the two previous games , his ninth @-@ inning home run against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 27 tied the game 3 – 3 , and the Cardinals eventually won with a score of 4 – 3 . He homered in three straight games June 22 – 24 , including successive contests against the Marlins from June 23 – 24 as St. Louis won both times . On July 18 against the Mets , he matched a career high with five hits in a 12 – 2 win . 
 In an August 16 contest against the Marlins , Heyward hit two home runs for his first multi @-@ home run game with the Cardinals . An important defensive play was on September 20 against the Cubs . With the bases loaded and no outs in the eighth inning , Addison Russell hit a fly ball that Heyward caught running and threw home to catcher Yadier Molina to tag out Anthony Rizzo by two steps , preserving a 4 – 3 win . In the second game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh on September 30 , Heyward hit his second career grand slam in an 11 – 1 win , giving the Cardinals their 100th victory of the season while clinching their third consecutive National League Central division title . He also robbed both Francisco <unk> and Michael Morse of hits in this game . 
 Heyward finished the season with a career @-@ high .293 batting average , .359 on @-@ base percentage , and .439 slugging percentage . Since his major league debut , he also had led all major league fielders in DRS and , for the previous three seasons , was second only to former Braves teammate <unk> Simmons . Among all outfielders since 2010 , Heyward 's 96 @.@ 2 accumulated ultimate zone rating ( UZR ) led all major league outfielders to second @-@ place Alex Gordon 's 68 @.@ 3 UZR . After becoming a free agent for the first time in his career , Heyward won his third Fielding Bible Award and third Gold Glove Award . 
 = = = Chicago Cubs = = = 
 On December 15 , 2015 , Heyward signed an eight @-@ year , $ 184 million contract with the Cubs . One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites large enough to accommodate teammate David Ross , his wife , and their three young children on all of the Cubs ' road trips during the 2016 season . Ross , set to retire after the 2016 season , had been Heyward 's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta , and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career . In an interview with the Bleacher Report website , Heyward said , 
 I know how special it is to have teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta . You don 't take it for granted . I wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart , as a teammate and as a friend , for what he 's done for me . 
 = = Awards = = 
 = = Skills profile = = 
 Standing 6 feet 5 inches ( 1 @.@ 96 m ) and weighing 245 pounds ( 111 kg ) , Heyward has shown to be an all @-@ round talent . In the minor leagues , his ability to hit for batting average and power , speed , plus defense and arm strength sufficient to play right field , caused him to be considered a five @-@ tool player . Further , his plate discipline and ability to draw walks are unusual for a player his height . He generates much of his power as a pull hitter . 
 From very early in his career , Heyward has played with an outside anticipation of developing into one of the most dominant players in the league . However , he has mentioned being uncomfortable with the pressure that comes with such expectations . Journalist Bernie Miklasz of the St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch opined that the pressures of stardom obliquely induced the overall descent in performance from his rookie season . 
 Heyward still has a hole in his swing that has yet to resolve . While he was in the minor leagues , his unorthodox swing was not regarded as a significant issue , but rather was perceived to have worked for him because of his enormous talent . To the contrary , one scout compared it to an awkward golf swing . " You watch him , he really stiff @-@ arms the bat out there " , noting Heyward almost fully extends his arms to attempt to power the head of the bat through the strike zone . He does not protect the inside of part of the strike zone as well as the outside . That creates a weakness that allows pitchers – especially power pitchers – to throw inside , thus exploiting an inability to attain contact on inside pitches efficiently . 
 " The ball he hits well is the ball out away from him " , according to the same scout . " If pitchers pitch around him , on the outer half , he 'll crush it . ... That 's why Niese hit him : He went up and in , and Heyward 's a diver . " Indeed , charts from <unk> LLC depicting Heyward 's " Hot Zones " , or a hitter 's zones of maximum effectiveness , corroborate the scout 's findings . Through April 25 , 2014 , Heyward had swung at 22 of 55 pitches in 2014 that qualified as " up and in " , crossing the plate either to the upper left ninth of the strike zone or slightly higher or inside of it . None of those 22 swings had produced a hit . 
 However , an injury contributed to lost power in 2011 . Before that point , Heyward dropped his hands after the start of the swing and rotated his front shoulder in an upward motion in his mode as a pull hitter . Normally , the front half of his upper body generates bat velocity . During the time the injury had not properly healed , it hindered his ability to generate torque from his front shoulder that contributed most to driving the ball . 
 In spite of not reaching his offensive projections , his defense has delivered as promised . Heyward has been rated as one of the top right fielders , if not the top right fielder , in MLB . The Fielding Bible staff has said that he " is the best defensive right fielder in baseball , bar none , " . He is an expert at instantly picking up and reacting to the path of the batted ball and following it with efficient routes . Such defensive ability was demonstrated on a fly ball off Justin Turner 's bat during the 2013 season . The same play was part of a demonstration in 2014 of Major League Baseball Advanced Media 's <unk> system , a hybrid of <unk> / x , <unk> / x and a radar @-@ based play tracking . <unk> analyzed that Heyward got a jump off the fly ball the bat in 2 ⁄ 100 second , ran at 18 @.@ 5 miles per hour ( 29 @.@ 8 km / h ) and took a route with a 97 % efficiency . The ball had 4 @.@ 0 seconds of hang time and he ran 80 @.@ 9 feet ( 24 @.@ 7 m ) for the catch . 
 In rating of three zones to where the ball is hit in right field in his first five seasons , he was above average at saving bases on shallow @-@ hit ( + 31 ) and medium @-@ hit ( + 40 ) balls . His greatest strength came with deep @-@ hit balls ( + 140 ) . In 2014 alone , he saved + 40 bases on balls hit to the deepest part of right field , which was the equivalent of 20 doubles . The enormous ground coverage makes up for what would be considered a slightly below average arm among right fielders . Commented Fielding Bible founder John Dewan , " Heyward has been able to accomplish this ( winning the Fielding Bible Award ) by starting and finishing every play extremely well . He excels at picking up the ball off the bat and rarely takes the wrong angle . He is not afraid to dive , demonstrating tremendous body control when doing so . "

 In September 2012 , Piedmont Henry Hospital in Stockbridge , Georgia , selected Heyward as one of ten representatives for their Real Men Wear Pink campaign against breast cancer . He stated at the time one of his grandmothers was battling the condition but had improved , and that her battle was an inspiration for him to participate . 
 <unk> brother , Jacob , is an outfielder in the San Francisco Giants organization . He was drafted by the Braves out of high school in the 2013 MLB Draft and the San Francisco Giants in the 2016 MLB Draft .

 a b Developed by the organization that awards The Fielding Bible , defensive runs saved ( DRS ) measures a player 's total defensive plays made in terms of numbers of runs above or below what the average player at that position made . A calculation system computes the number of plays made league @-@ wide at each position and a plus @-@ minus total rating for each player compared to a league average player . For example , if Heyward made a play that only 20 % of right fielders would make , he was credited with .8 points – or , 1 point minus <unk> . If he failed to make a play that 75 % of right fielders made , then .75 points was subtracted from his score .

 = Liberal Movement ( Australia ) = 
 The Liberal Movement ( LM ) was a South Australian political party in the 1970s . Stemming from discontent within the ranks of the Liberal and Country League ( LCL ) , it was organised in 1972 by former premier Steele Hall as an internal group in response to a perceived resistance to sought reform within its parent . A year later , when tensions heightened between the LCL 's conservative wing and the LM , it was established in its own right as a progressive liberal party . 
 When still part of the league , it had eleven state parliamentarians . On its own , it was reduced to three parliamentarians − Hall and Robin Millhouse in the lower house and Martin Cameron in the upper house . At the 1974 federal election Hall won a Senate seat and was replaced by David Boundy . At the 1975 state election , Millhouse and Boundy retained their seats , while John Carnie won a second seat and Cameron retained his seat in the upper house , bringing the party to a peak of five parliamentarians . 
 In the 1974 federal election , it succeeded in having Hall elected to the Australian Senate with a primary vote of 10 per cent in South Australia . It built upon this in the 1975 state election , gaining almost a fifth of the total vote and an additional member . However , the non @-@ Labor parties narrowly failed to dislodge the incumbent Dunstan Labor government . That result , together with internal weaknesses , led in 1976 to the LM 's being re @-@ absorbed into the LCL , which by then had become the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia . The non @-@ Labor forces again failed at the 1977 state election but succeeded in winning government for one term at the 1979 state election . 
 A segment of the LM , led by former state attorney @-@ general Robin Millhouse , did not rejoin the Liberals , but instead formed a new party — the New LM . This party , combined with the Australia Party — under the invited leadership of Don Chipp — formed the nucleus of the Australian Democrats which aspired to a balance of power in the federal Senate and up to four state upper houses for three decades . The LM and its successor parties gave voice to what is termed " small @-@ l liberalism " in Australia . 
 = = Party system = = 
 Before parties became established in the Australian colonies in the later 19th century , all members of the colonial parliaments were independents , occasionally labelled as " liberal " or " conservative " , amongst other terms . With the advent of Labor , these groups combined to form anti @-@ Labor parties . " Liberal " , in the Australian context , refers to what could be described as classical liberalism , and is distant from the modern meaning that the word has acquired in the United States and some other countries . As a train of thought , Australian liberalism has been less rooted in any defined ideology and more in pragmatism and opposition to Labor . Liberalism in Australia represents the centre @-@ right of the political spectrum , while Labor represents the centre @-@ left . 
 The first Labor party in South Australia was the United Labor Party in 1891 , born out of a trade union association that recommended and supported trade unionist candidates . In response , the National Defence League ( NDL ) was born two years later . In 1909 , the NDL combined with the Liberal and Democratic Union and the Farmers and Producers Political Union to form the Liberal Union , later known as the Liberal Federation . The ULP morphed into the Australian Labor Party in 1910 , and has been known by this name ever since . A separate Country Party subsequently emerged , representing rural interests , but this was assimilated back into the conservative side of politics with the formation of the Liberal and Country League ( LCL ) in 1932 . The South Australian party system has not deviated from this two @-@ party divide , and all other parties gained negligible representation or influence , until the emergence of smaller parties such as the Australian Democrats in the late 20th century , and the Australian Greens and Family First Party in the 21st century . 
 = = Liberal representation = = 
 Political scientists Neal Blewett and Dean Jaensch characterised the LCL as a strange amalgamation of differing groups : " the Adelaide ' establishment ' , the yeoman proprietary ( farmers and regional workers ) , and the Adelaide middle class " . Of these groups , the middle class was the most electorally depressed , both in parliament and within the party itself , owing to a 2 : 1 ratio favouring regional areas both in electoral legislation and the party organisation . The establishment influenced the party with its financial backing , while the yeoman proprietary was the most numerous . Only in 1956 did the urban middle class achieve parliamentary representation through Robin Millhouse , who was elected to the urban middle class seat of Mitcham . 
 Millhouse was a vocal advocate of his broader constituency , championing their case in a party dominated by rural conservatives . He wrote a paper on the ' Liberal Case for Electoral Reform ' , arguing for a fairer electoral system , as it was biased against voters resident in the capital city , Adelaide , whether they be progressive or conservative , Liberal or Labor . Many younger urban middle class voters , who would have normally been attracted to the LCL , were abandoning the party for Labor owing to their dissatisfaction with the malapportioned electoral system known as the ' Playmander ' . But this concerned the rural conservatives little , who hoped to retain their hold on power through the present system , which included a Legislative Council where suffrage was based on land ownership , resulting in a body dominated by the ruling class and the rural landholders , and a 16 – 4 LCL majority . Millhouse 's paper was quickly ignored . 
 The LCL had governed , primarily under the stead of Sir Thomas Playford , for 32 years , and finally lost to Labor in 1965 . A year and a half later , when Playford retired , Steele Hall was elected to replace him . A young farmer from a rural constituency , Hall had never conflicted with the party line , and was expected to uphold the existing LCL principles , having spoken out in support of the Playmander and the restrictive Legislative Council before . However , when the LCL was returned to office in 1968 under his leadership , with the help of malapportionment , Hall was under pressure . Labor had led the LCL 52 @.@ 0 to 43 @.@ 8 % on primary votes , but owing to the Playmander , both ended with 19 seats and an independent supported the LCL and returned them to power . Large protests against the Playmander broke out , and there were strong calls for reform . 
 The LCL had routinely ignored such protests before , but Hall 's course differed from what was expected . He appointed Millhouse his Attorney @-@ General , and continued a raft of social reform that had begun under the previous Labor government . This was opposed by some conservatives within the party ; lines began to be drawn , and factions began to appear . Hall commented in the party 's newsletter that " too many people see the LCL as a party tied to conservative traditions . We must show voters that we can move with the times , that we are ' with it ' . "

 The level of malapportionment had grown to a level in excess of 3 : 1 in favour of rural areas , and Hall , having won the 1968 state election on 46 per cent of the two @-@ party @-@ preferred vote , committed himself to a fairer electoral system . Previously 39 members were elected : 13 from metropolitan Adelaide and 26 from the country . Hall 's first attempt for reform was a system with 45 seats and 20 from the country ; this proposal received scorn from both Labor and the rural councillors , and was seen as not going far enough by the former and going too far by the latter . A second proposal , for 47 seats with 19 in the country , was adopted with bipartisan support in the House of Assembly , but encountered opposition in the Legislative Council . The new system would make an LCL win near @-@ impossible at the coming 1970 state election , and Hall and the LCL were aware of it . For his weakening of rural constituencies , Hall became an enemy to those councillors who stood in defence of the previous system . Hall saw the political situation as untenable and felt the LCL needed reform to cope with the removal of an artificial situation . 
 Labor 's leader , Don Dunstan , also introduced a bill for reform of the Legislative Council , which sought to remove its wage and property based qualifications and instil adult suffrage . Hall himself stated he would approve the bill if it included a clause guaranteeing that the Legislative Council could only be abolished through a referendum . Dunstan agreed , but Hall 's own party split on the issue . The bill passed the House of Assembly with Labor support , but failed in the Legislative Council where the LCL 's rural conservatives dominated its restricted electoral base . 
 Behind the votes in parliament was a personal antagonism between Hall and Ren DeGaris , the leader of the LCL in the Legislative Council . DeGaris , who was elected to the council in 1962 , was a staunch defender of its franchise and electoral boundaries . The two were the de facto leaders of the party 's two factions ; Hall represented the urban @-@ based progressives , and DeGaris the rural @-@ based conservatives . The conflict between the two extended beyond politics and on to a personal level , contributing to the polarisation of views within the LCL and making it difficult for an internal compromise to be reached on the issue of electoral reform . 
 After the LCL lost government in 1970 , primarily owing to the electoral reform , Hall managed to be re @-@ elected as leader . He convinced a majority of the party 's membership that reform was needed , and sought to remove the influence that the party 's representatives in the Legislative Council held . When the Dunstan government again introduced a bill to introduce universal suffrage to the council , Hall gained the support of 7 out of 20 members in the Assembly , but only 2 of 16 LCL members in the Legislative Council supported the bill . Internally , there was much opposition to any electoral reform when the matter was debated at party conferences . 
 The conservatives then moved against Hall , putting forward party proposals to lessen the influence of its parliamentary leader . Liberal parties in Australia had long held to a tradition of the separation of houses , independence of members , and the ability of the parliamentary leader to choose his own cabinet . The rural councillors sought to preserve their power , and demanded that cabinet positions not be decided by the leader , but elected by the parliamentary party as a whole . As this would include the Legislative Council , dominated by its rural membership , Hall 's support among moderate Liberals would be overwhelmed by the councillors ' inclusion . Hall privately told Legislative Council Chairman David Brookman that he could not work with De Garis and that he would resign if he was not allowed to choose his cabinet . 
 After the parliamentary party agreed on this issue 12 – 8 , Hall resigned the leadership on 16 March 1972 , stating that " I cannot continue to lead a Party that will not follow ; I cannot lead a Party which has lost its idealism and which has forgotten that its purpose for existence is to govern successfully for the welfare of all South Australians . Our Party is still deeply cleft by the persuasive influence of a number of its members in the Legislative Council . " Later in the speech , he said " Over the last three years I have been subject to a great deal of disloyalty on a continuing basis ... I had hoped this afternoon to move a motion of no confidence in the Government ; instead , I found out Party had moved a vote of no confidence in itself . " Premier Dunstan , with whom Hall had never had amiable relations , crossed the floor of the house and shook Hall 's hand in a gesture of solidarity . Hall said he " was knifed " and said the conservatives ' actions were " a clear example of how deeply the wooden horses of the Legislative Council have entrenched themselves in the ranks of the Assembly membership " . The LCL President Ian McLachlan put on a brave face , saying " Mr Hall had some personal problems with the party , but these differences do not make a divided party " but he was quoted the next day as saying that the proposal was mooted to gauge Hall 's power . The obscure and low @-@ key conservative Bruce Eastick was installed as the new leader , as some more prominent figures such as Millhouse were seen as too sympathetic to Hall . In the meantime , there was a strong reaction to Hall 's departure among the public , and segments of the LCL , notably the youth wings , demonstrated against the events and made motions of objection . Hall had expected to become a normal backbencher , but the groundswell of support prompted a change of heart . 
 = = Formation = = 
 Hall initially sought to appeal to the State Council of the LCL . Although the body had no binding authority over the parliamentary caucus , which chose the leader , Hall and his followers saw it as an opportunity for a media victory . The motion went narrowly against Hall , but it generated much attention and potential embarrassment for the conservatives . 
 After this , he thought of establishing his own separate party , citing small opinion polls that supported this action , but Ian Wilson , the former member for the federal Division of Sturt , convinced him to stay within the LCL and bring about internal change . Strong support emerged from within the party for Hall 's stand , particularly from its youth wing , the Young Liberals . On 21 March 1972 , a faction , but closer to a " party within a party " was formed : the New Liberals . On 28 March it was renamed the Liberal Movement . The conservatives strongly criticised Hall and his new movement , accusing them of undermining Eastick , disrupting the party and being disloyal . 
 It quickly gained support within the LCL 's membership , capturing a number of party branches and began <unk> its own members . Robin Millhouse was a member of the faction , and served as both the deputy leader of the LCL and the LM . Thanks to the electoral reform that had occurred , with more urban electoral districts to contest , the urban @-@ based LM greatly increased its parliamentary representation , with seven members in the House of Assembly ( including Hall , Millhouse and future Premiers David Tonkin and Dean Brown ) , three in the Legislative Council , and one in the Australian House of Representatives ( Ian Wilson ) . Soon there were factional clashes during parliamentary debate , combative television debates , and some LCL members began campaigning anonymously against the LCL . One LCL branch president publicly called Hall a " traitor " . The LM managed to worry the conservatives by managing to seize control of some rural branches within electorates held by strongly anti @-@ LM representatives , including that of De Garis . The conservatives tried to remove Hall 's endorsement for his seat , but failed . Several bitterly fought pre @-@ selection battles followed . As a former premier , Hall was much more proficient than Eastick at dealing with the press , and used his skills to generate more media publicity , prompting Eastick to claim bias . 
 The LM sought to seize control of the LCL agenda by winning key positions on the state executive at the annual general meeting in September , but this was difficult as the malapportionment towards rural groups was entrenched at party level , and because the conservatives had anticipated the LM 's plans . The LM President Alex Perryman challenged McLachlan for the party presidency and in a high @-@ profile contest received 47 % of the vote in a narrow defeat . He received around 90 % among urban delegates and around 33 % of the rural votes , the latter figure shocking the conservatives . The LM later generated more publicity by inquiring about alleged impropriety in the balloting process . 
 The LM 's policies were generally progressive , and Hall himself stated that " we had no major differences with the written philosophies of the LCL " . The LM 's colour , purple , was described by observers as " LCL blue with a dash of Labor red " , signifying the faction 's location on the political spectrum . The LM was less concerned with creating differing policy as it was taking over and reforming the LCL ; however , on the electoral reform front , the LM started by calling for the Legislative Council to be devoid of ministers . Worried by the LM , conservatives in the LCL tried to change the party rules to prevent members from criticising the organisation in public , and enforce discipline . This backfired as the LM exploited it to portray the conservatives as repressive , and the media also viewed it negatively , and the move was put on hold . The non @-@ Labor forces , in their disunity , were in a poor position to challenge the dominance of charismatic Premier Dunstan . The LM itself contained two poorly defined internal groups : moderates , concerned with the inequalities of the electoral systems and the LCL 's aging image ; and radicals , who espoused the aforementioned in addition to the desire for wide @-@ ranging social reform . Some of the latter felt Hall was the most progressive option available , but not progressive enough . Nevertheless , the LM had generated a large amount of campaign funds and had great name recognition ; Hall was also favoured in opinions as a better leader than Eastick by a threefold factor . They cited such figures to portray themselves as the main threat to Labor and justify why they were the direction the LCL needed to take . Late in the year the LM received another boost when Wilson regained the seat of Sturt for the Liberal Party at the 1972 federal election , making much of his LM membership . 
 In the 1973 state election , the LM largely ran a separate campaign from the LCL as a whole . The majority of the LCL 's metropolitan candidates were also within the LM , and it was hoped that enough seats would be gained so that not only would the LCL return to power , but that the LM would be able to overpower the conservative faction in the House of Assembly and re @-@ elect Hall as leader . To do this , they needed to capture at least three marginal Labor seats in Adelaide . This also meant the conservatives in the LCL would be better off losing to Labor if they wanted to maintain their hold on the party , as Labor 's vulnerable seats were in all in the city , and a Labor loss meant a LM gain . The LCL campaign chairperson explicitly said that she would prefer losing if it meant keeping control of the party . While the LM ran an innovative campaign , the LCL itself faltered , losing support in the country to a separate Country Party and to Labor in metropolitan Adelaide . One LM seat held by a rural member was lost to the Country Party . The LM were branded by the LCL conservatives as being the reason behind the LCL 's defeat . The LM saw itself as a more modern and appropriate alternative to the LCL , more in tune with urban mainstream , but there was no evidence that urban LM candidates were more popular than conservative LCL candidates in Adelaide . LM members made up the majority of urban LCL candidates , but were unable to wrest any Labor seats in Adelaide . 
 Labor 's convincing win was not unexpected , particularly as infighting in the LCL had been ongoing for over a year . Friction was present throughout the campaign as well as before it , particularly as much of the donations were given directly to the LM . In the months before the election LCL members had thrown punches in the corridors of Parliament House . Internal battles between conservatives and LM members for party pre @-@ selection were keenly contested . Around half of the LCL candidates were LM supporters and avoided mention of the LCL and its conservative leader Bruce Eastick in their pamphlets . Some of the LM faction candidates instead trumpeted Hall as their leader and printed books detailing their policies . There was also an incident where a LM function celebrating Wilson 's win in the 1972 federal election clashed with Eastick 's main policy speech . Eastick and his conservatives arrived at Wilson 's dinner after they finished campaigning for the night , but then walked out when Wilson was delivering a speech calling for the LCL to be more tolerant of the diverse opinions within the party . Labor ran a sedate campaign , but made much of the internal LCL divisions . 
 = = Split = = 
 Despite the LCL 's defeat , the failure of the LM to gain internal supremacy over the conservatives was seen by the latter as a vindication of their policies . Pressure from the LCL 's leader , Bruce Eastick , who called on the LM to disband , and the conservative wing of the party , saw machinations against the LM . Hall reiterated the LM 's intention to continue , but Millhouse was removed as the LCL deputy leader in 1973 , and pressure began to be mounted on the faction , which did not have any members on the frontbench ; Hall did not pursue a position in the shadow ministry . Tension continued as rumours spread claiming that the LCL State Council was contemplating the forbidding and vetoing of LM members from representing the party in elections . While Hall and Martin Cameron responded by publicly vowing to stand firm , several of their LM colleagues were ambivalent when asked about the intentions if the LM were no longer tolerated within the LCL . However , Heini Becker left the LM . 
 On 23 March , a motion was passed at the state council that allowed it to deny membership to those who belonged to " outside political organisations " , and the LM was subsequently declared to be one . Strangely , an LCL member could also be a member of the Communist Party of Australia , but not the LM . A motion by LM members to also declare the League of Rights an outside political organisation failed . The LCL conservatives were confident the LM would capitulate and reintegrate , as third parties had never been successful in South Australia . At first , LM members tried to have their banning from the LCL deemed illegal , but this failed . 
 It was not expected that the LM would split to form a separate party . But before it was established , Hall promptly resigned from the LCL , declaring it " hypocritical and decadent " . Martin Cameron quickly followed , and Robin Millhouse consulted with members from his constituency before agreeing to resign from the LCL . Ian Wilson , who had earlier managed to convince Hall not to form a separate party , tried in vain to sway him to remain with the LCL and focus on reforming it from within . He wanted to shut down the LM in an attempt to limit the damage to the party , believing that " political groups come and go , but the ideals we aim for will never change " . All other LCL @-@ LM members did not follow ; three lower house members including Tonkin and Brown , Wilson in the federal parliament , and two <unk> all stayed in the LCL . David Tonkin stated that " every one of those Liberals who resign from the League is making it more and more certain that the League will remain just as it is " . 
 A number of LCL branches remained with the LM , and there were mass resignations from the LCL on the whole . Eastick was relatively unconcerned : the LCL had a massive membership of over 30 @,@ 000 and the LM 's split did little to dent it — Eastick admitted 200 individual resignations . In the meantime , the LCL tried to introduce a requirement for members to make " pledge " that they were not aligned with " an outside political body " . This prompted a second wave of resignations , notably from sections of the Young Liberal Movement . Despite its leader 's show of confidence , many in the LCL were concerned that the expulsion of LM elements had apparently backfired ; it also prompted some disillusioned parliamentarians to suggest that rural and urban elements in the LCL could not coexist . 
 The new party was formally announced on 2 April after an LM convention . As the LM had already begun establishing an infrastructure while in the LCL , it was able to pick up momentum readily , presenting itself as a centrist moderate party , but it was never able to shed its reliance on Hall . 
 As Hall and Millhouse were both competent parliamentary performers , it was widely acknowledged in the media that they outperformed the LCL in providing an effective opposition . In one parliamentary division , with the entirety of the ALP and LCL on one side of the house and the LM members on the other , Millhouse took one of many opportunities to taunt Eastick and damage the LCL , labelling him " Dunstan lover ! " The South Australian media , which had earlier warmed to Premier Dunstan , then focused their attention on the LM and gave the fledgling party much @-@ needed publicity . 
 The primary instigator for the creation of the LM in 1972 had been based around the lack of electoral reform . The electoral system had been expected to continue to return rural LCL members in the Legislative Council , yet at the 1973 state election Labor had , through the mass registration of new voters for the council vote , managed to gain two seats , giving a 14 – 6 split in the council . As half the council was elected at each election , Labor only had to retain their vote to gain an additional two seats at the 1975 state election , and a minor rise in it would see additional council seats fall to them . It was increasingly plausible that Labor would be able to gain a majority in the Legislative Council within a decade and then carry through their goal of abolishing it , and push through any electoral legislation it so wished . 
 To the LCL , this was a dangerous situation , and seeing a need to avoid it , they compromised : their position abruptly changed to being in favour of wholesale reform of the Legislative Council . When Dunstan put forward bills to reform it , the LCL relented , and Eastick convinced the LCL councillors to let them pass , conditional on amendments to the legislation . These were a minor change to the particular proportional system used to elect the councillors , and that it remained non compulsory to vote in the council . The new council would eventually have 22 members , with half elected each election from a multi @-@ member constituency covering the entirety of the state . Hall attacked the LCL for its sudden change in stance on reform , and managed to see the first LM policy become law with the lowering of the council suffrage age to 18 . 
 The reform legislation for the Legislative Council was not to take effect until the next election , and the death of LCL MLC Harold Kemp necessitated a by @-@ election for the council district of Southern on 11 August . Southern was an ultra @-@ safe rural LCL seat , and Labor declined to stand in the by @-@ election . It was contested by the LCL , the LM , a separate Country Party and the Australia Party . The three non @-@ LCL parties agreed on favourable preference deals in the hope of one of them displacing the LCL . The LM gained 29 per cent of the vote , and the LCL candidate won by a 4 per cent margin once preferences had been distributed . 
 At the start of 1974 , the LCL had undertaken some progressive reforms . They brought in a less conservative membership at the grassroots level , although the old guard was still prominent in parliamentary roles . They tried to broach the possibility of reintegrating the LM . Wilson and the new executive director of the LCL , John Vial were at the forefront , but the LM was optimistic about its future and refused unless the LCL changed leaders and allowed for explicitly separate urban and rural factions , which did not happen . 
 = = Elections and support = = 
 = = = Federal election 1974 = = = 
 In order to give the LM national exposure , Hall decided to stand for the Australian Senate at the 1974 federal election . Another objective was to allow Millhouse and Cameron to become more prominent at state level and dispel the established perception of the LM as a Hall party . The move was a risk as failure would have left the LM 's main drawcard out of the spotlight entirely until a state election which was not due for another two years , but Hall said the party had no future unless it could gain national stature . Another possible problem was that the media could have lost interest in the LM at a state level regardless of whether Hall won a senate position . The 1975 federal election followed a double dissolution ( meaning that all Senate seats , rather than half , were up for election and thus a candidate needed only roughly half of the normal percentage to gain election ; Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was hoping to attain a majority in the Senate ) , and all ten South Australian Senate seats were contested . The battle between the LCL and the LM was not seen as a large part of the national campaign , as South Australia was only a small part of the nation and most of the marginal seats that would determine the outcome were in other states . The LM gained 9 @.@ 9 per cent of the vote in the Senate and Hall was elected in his own right , without the assistance of preferences . In the House of Representatives , the LM gained 8 @.@ 4 per cent of the vote across the 12 South Australian seats , ranging from a high of 18 per cent in metropolitan Boothby to 1 @.@ 6 per cent in rural Angas . Fortunately for Hall and the LM , the senate election resulted in Labor and the Liberal @-@ Country Party coalition holding 29 seats each , and Hall was one of two <unk> who held the balance of power . The media made much of Hall 's position as a <unk> at federal level , and the Liberals responded to him in a hostile manner ; for his part , Hall continued to persistently attack them as outmoded and lambasted them over the matter of electoral reform . 
 Hall had abandoned his rural Yorke Peninsula @-@ based seat of Goyder to stand for the Senate , and at the 1974 Goyder state by @-@ election the LM were concerned about how their vote would stand without the assistance of its prominent incumbent and in an area outside their urban base ; the LCL had always won the seat easily . The campaign was robust , with strong accusations being traded as what was previously a safe seat became evenly poised and the subject of frantic electioneering . Surprisingly , as the LM was an urban movement , they polled 46 per cent of the vote , which saw David Boundy elected on the back of Country Party preferences with a two @-@ party preferred vote beyond 60 % . Despite most of its preferences flowing to the LM , the Country Party attacked the LM for perceived hypocrisy as they had run in a rural seat despite calling for the anti @-@ Labor forces to be separated into urban and rural divisions . This continued to be a source of tension , as the LM continued to campaign in rural seats , prompting the Country Party to threaten to deny them preferences . The LM triumph embarrassed the LCL , and Eastick survived a leadership challenge from Heini Becker in the aftermath . Over the next year , the LM focused on building the party machinery . 
 = = = State election 1975 = = = 
 At the 1975 state election the LM had ambitions of becoming the largest non @-@ Labor party . The campaign was focused primarily on accusations of mismanagement of the economy by Labor , with the LM seeking to positioning itself between the Liberals and Labor , as the centre @-@ ground of South Australian politics . Advertisements attacked the Liberal Party for being a conservative party , and Labor for its perceived socialism and poor economic record . At the time , inflation and unemployment was increasing . The LM slogan was " Vote LM — You know it 's right " . Despite now being a federal senator , Hall was still synonymous with the LM at state level and he was central in the party 's advertising . The momentum was against Labor , and it was expected that the election could come down to whether Labor would retain their marginal urban seats . The LM proposed to the Liberals to have a joint candidate in the marginal metropolitan seat of Gilles — which required a two @-@ party preferred swing of 6 % — to maximise their chances . The Liberals agreed but wanted the joint candidate to stand in Unley , and no agreement was reached . 
 Millhouse , now the State Parliamentary Leader of the LM , announced the LM 's policy for the 1975 state election at the Adelaide Town Hall on 2 July . He outlined the LM 's plans for economic rejuvenation : an end to compulsory unionism , budget and tax cuts , and measures to curb rising inflation and cost of living . Social policy included proposals for an early form of multiculturalism and promotion of ' cultural diversity ' and bilingualism . Energy policy appealed to a new generation of environmentalists , and promoted conservation and promotion of solar power . He slammed the proposed City of Monarto as a ' monument to socialist folly ' . 
 Contesting 45 of the 47 seats , the LM commanded almost a fifth ( 18 @.@ 2 per cent ) of the vote in the lower house and the combined non @-@ Labor forces gained 50 @.@ 8 per cent of the two @-@ party @-@ preferred total . The LM was more effective in the city , recording 20 @.@ 2 % of the urban vote and 13 @.@ 4 % in rural areas . The party increased its parliamentary representation by one , with an additional member in the Legislative Council , and made several formerly safe Liberal seats marginal ( including that of its leader , Eastick where they captured 20 @.@ 3 % in the rural district of Light ) . The LM withstood a concerted push by the Liberals to oust Millhouse from Mitcham , and retained Goyder . They were also strong in those seats held by LM members who did not break away during the split but stayed with the LCL . However , preferences did not flow as the non @-@ Labor parties had wished , with up to 20 per cent of LM second @-@ preferences flowing to Labor instead of the Liberals or Country Party . With the new proportional system in the Legislative Council after the electoral reforms , the LM captured 18 @.@ 8 % of the vote to end with 2 of the 11 seats available . This was enough to allow Labor and the LM to join together and sidestep conservative Liberal opposition in the upper house . The Liberals , having suffered a 12 per cent reduction in their metropolitan primary vote , and gained their lowest result , quickly dumped Eastick , who was an unimpressive parliamentary performer and seen as an obstacle to reintegration with the LM , as leader . Tonkin became the new leader , the first Liberal leader from a metropolitan seat . The federal Liberal Party was rattled by the strength of the LM , and tried to reintegrate them . Hall was offered a high position in the Liberal senate ticket if he rejoined , and a position in cabinet if the Liberals defeated the federal Labor government . The LM regarded its first state electoral performance as impressive , and optimistic with their future , they flatly rejected the overtures . However , they had also gone into debt to fund their election campaign . Millhouse also found it harder to dominate the Liberals and seize the momentum in parliamentary debate when proceedings resumed ; he found Tonkin a much more formidable opponent than Eastick . 
 = = = Federal election 1975 = = = 
 The second consecutive double dissolution 1975 federal election in December was held owing to the dismissal of the Whitlam Government by Governor General John Kerr , and the subsequent appointment of federal Liberal leader Malcolm Fraser as Prime Minister . Prior to the dismissal , the Liberal Party had used its majority in the Australian Senate to block supply bills . Hall voted in favour of the supply bills being passed , and objected to the federal Liberals ' actions . Hall had been praised for his stance on supply , but the Liberals attacked him , accusing him of being " Labor in a purple disguise " and saying that Fraser needed a compliant senate " not hampered by independents sitting on the fence " . Hall countered by saying he was <unk> the Liberals and therefore not Labor @-@ aligned , and that he was a " dedicated anti @-@ socialist " . 
 Hall saw the double dissolution as an opportunity to capture senate seats in all the states across the nation , and the LM sought to create bases outside South Australia . On 18 November , a LM rally was held at Melbourne Town Hall to launch a branch in Victoria . A branch was formed in Queensland and Hall travelled to Western Australia to oversee the formation of a state branch . Generally , the LM 's attempts to spread its message failed owing to the dramatic and highly polarising effects of Whitlam 's dismissal and the constitutional crisis , which produced angry demonstrations around the country . Amid the tumult , the media was almost completely focused on the two main parties , giving other groups almost no opportunities to capture the public imagination . The LM also found it difficult to establish a connection with the populace outside South Australia owing to its formation within a state @-@ specific backdrop . 
 Attempts were made to expand the appeal of the LM through secret merger talks with the Australia Party , who initiated the idea , but these collapsed . The campaign was also hampered by the departure of two LM candidates who relabelled themselves as the Independent Liberal Movement . The first to leave the LM , C. W. Henderson , was a member of the LM Management Committee who criticised Hall 's attempts to make spread the party nationally . He accused Hall of having " delusions of grandeur " , leading to his membership being suspended two days later . The next day , J. Henderson , the sixth member of the senate ticket , quit , saying he did not " want to be a puppet on a party string " . Groves and Henderson aggressively campaigned against the LM , although they were to receive only 0 @.@ 09 % of the senate vote themselves . 
 When the election was held , there was a 12 percent swing towards the Liberal Party in South Australia , or 7 percent on two party preferred . There was a large swing against Labor owing to the dissatisfaction with the Whitlam administration , but it generally went directly to the Liberal Party . Against this background , and with relatively little media attention paid to the LM and its cause , Despite gaining prominence for his stance on supply , Hall struggled to be re @-@ elected , gaining only 6 @.@ 5 per cent of the Senate vote and relying on preferences , ironically from Labor . In South Australia , Labor gained 41 per cent of the vote , and the Liberals 51 per cent . In the lower house , the LM managed only 6 @.@ 2 % across the 12 seats , again recording its best result in Boothby , with 10 @.@ 4 % . Hall 's hope for Australia @-@ wide support for the LM was dashed owing to the previous events , with the party gaining negligible results for their candidates in other states . The lower house candidates in the Australian Capital Territory registered around 3 % , but the senate candidates in Western Australia , New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland received less than 1 % . Hall 's opinion was that " the Liberal Movement was for its part in the contest happy to have survived . " Nevertheless , Hall was still adamant the LM 's future was as a standalone entity : " The LM is going to continue as an Australia @-@ wide party ... We shall have to go through the sickening process of having the Liberal party make overtures to us once again ... I would like to tell them right now that they will be wasting their breath . " Despite Hall 's defiance , the poor showing meant his senate term was only to last for three rather than six years , and he no longer had the balance of power and the resulting media exposure . This was a problem , as the party was largely centred around his personality . 
 = = Decline = = 
 Independent of the LM , the LCL had begun to change . It eventually supported Don Dunstan 's bills for electoral reform , both to the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council , and its internal structure was reorganised and modernised , particular with the arrival of Tonkin , its first urban leader . The LCL renamed itself the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia to bring itself into line with its federal counterpart . Thus , many of the reasons for the LM 's split had become null . Combined with the LM 's declining membership ( one third of members had not renewed ) and its large debt , it found itself in a precarious position . Negotiations in 1976 began with the aim for the LM to merge into the new Liberal Party , and news of the secret talks were leaked in April . Once the news became public , Millhouse stated his complete opposition : " I will not rejoin the Liberal Party ... I have meant what I said in the past and I do not see any change in the attitude of the Liberal Party to alter my view . " He said doing so would entail a surrender of honour and self @-@ respect , and described the LM as the only " genuine Liberal party " in the nation , boldly predicting that its agenda would become dominant in society . Millhouse 's stand was widely condemned by the media , who saw it as based on pride rather than pragmatism , and unhelpful for anti @-@ Labor politics . Hall , however , wanted to unite the non @-@ Labor forces , and acknowledged that " there is no prospect of maintaining LM electorate groups ... in simple terms , our alternatives are to swallow some little pride , and unite to fight Labor . " He said to do otherwise would be to " exist in splendid selfish isolation " , and said they could not survive as a relevant force by holding Goyder and Mitcham and losing upper house seats owing to a dwindling vote . Hall said the LM 's reform agenda had been fulfilled , their finances were untenable and contended there was no ideological reason remaining for a split . This put him at increasing odds with Millhouse , who continued to describe the Liberals as " very conservative " . Some members of the Liberals were also wary of a merger , owing to the long @-@ standing antipathy between the two groups , and persistent criticism of them from the LM over the years . 
 In the meantime , the negotiations continued , with Hall prominent . During informal discussions following the 1975 state election , Millhouse had been offered the deputy leadership in a merged party , and Cameron a leading role in the upper house , but following the poor showing at the federal election and the deteriorating financial state of the LM , the offer was reduced and the posts that had been offered to Millhouse and Cameron were no longer available . However , Hall was still able to negotiate for the LM President and Treasurer to be given positions on a new executive . He also agreed to forego any further senate bids . An agreement was put in place to protect Boundy from being ousted at a pre @-@ selection of the new party , but this was broken at the next election . The LM was also given an equal voting share on pre @-@ selection committees for three urban lower house seats . 
 Labor was not pleased with the prospect of its opponents being reunited and potentially more effective , and Premier Dunstan mocked the opposition parties as a " circus " , while his deputy Des Corcoran predicted the new entity would not be able to last . The media continued to criticise Millhouse 's defiance as disruptive . 
 When the LM voted narrowly in May 1976 to rejoin the Liberals ( 222 to 211 ) , Millhouse immediately created the New LM , and became its only parliamentary representative . He tried to put an optimistic view on the matter , saying that the close @-@ run vote as an endorsement of his position , and the merger as an opportunity to start with a clean slate with no debt . The merger was finalised on 4 June when the Liberals ' State Council voted heavily in favour . 
 He was a prominent member of the Assembly , and a constant irritant to the Liberals , with whom he often sparred . When Don Chipp resigned from the federal Liberal Party , and stated his intention to create a centrist and progressive " third force " in Australian politics , Millhouse 's New LM responded . Chipp 's Australian Democrats was created , and negotiations began for a merger between the two parties . The New LM candidates at the 1977 state election stood under a joint New LM @-@ Australian Democrats ticket , winning 12 @.@ 3 per cent of the vote in the 12 electorates they contested , and Millhouse defeated the Liberal candidate in the lower house seat of Mitcham , which he would hold until 1982 . The merger was finalised on 3 October 1977 and the New LM was absorbed into the Democrats . Meanwhile , the interstate branches of the LM , which had been in existence for only six months , either disbanded in 1976 , or eventually evolved and merged into state components of the Democrats . The Western Australian division of the LM was the strongest interstate branch and renamed itself the Centre Line Party before becoming the state branch of the Democrats . 
 David Tonkin , an LM member before it split and became a separate party , had gained the Liberal party leadership in 1975 , succeeding Eastick . He worked swiftly to heal the internal party wounds , and to re @-@ establish the non @-@ Labor forces and provide an effective opposition . The 1977 state election saw a decline in Liberal support , but the party gained power after the abrupt resignation of Premier Dunstan , with an 11 per cent swing at 1979 state election , receiving 55 per cent of the two @-@ party @-@ preferred vote . The first Democrats MLC was also elected in 1979 on a first preference vote of 6 @.@ 5 per cent . In 1982 , however , the Labor Party again gained office and would rule for over a decade . The Democrats continued to attract support , and would solely hold the balance of power in the Legislative Council until the 1997 state election .

 = Jiloca ( river ) = 
 The Jiloca ( Spanish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) is a river in Aragón , Spain , a tributary of the river <unk> , and part of the watershed of the Ebro basin . The course of the river runs through the provinces of Teruel and Zaragoza . It has a length of 126 kilometres ( 78 mi ) and an average flow rate of 2 @.@ 1 cubic metres per second ( 74 cu ft / s ) , although this varies between the seasons . The river flows in a generally north easterly direction from its source near Monreal del Campo . 
 The valley was an historic route between the Meseta Central and the Mediterranean coast . Roman bridges remain in many pueblos and remains of watermills can be seen . The water is generally of good quality and supports a range of wildlife . Cleaning works by the regional government have been criticised by environmental organisations who claim that the ecology has been damaged . The watershed covers an area of 2 @,@ 957 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 142 sq mi ) .

 The source is disputed , tradition holds that it rises at an artesian well , the Fuente de Cella , at the base of the Sierra Albarracín in Teruel province . The well is surrounded by an elliptical parapet wall built by the Italian engineer Domingo Ferrari . It is now thought that the stretch of river between Cella and Monreal del Campo is the remains of an 18th @-@ century canal which was cut to drain the Laguna <unk> at <unk> . It is currently accepted that the Jiloca raises at the Ojos ( Eyes ) of Monreal , 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) from the town . These are a series of ponds linked by channels . From Monreal the river flows northwards and near <unk> de Jiloca ( <unk> ) , the Jiloca is joined by its only tributary , the Pancrudo , which rises 46 kilometres ( 29 mi ) away in the Sierra de la <unk> . From this point there is an irrigation channel which waters a small valley near Daroca . 
 The river flows on from Daroca in a north easterly direction , past <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Morata de Jiloca , <unk> and Paracuellos de Jiloca until it joins the <unk> between <unk> and Calatayud .

 The Jiloca has an average flow rate of 2 @.@ 1 cubic metres per second ( 74 cu ft / s ) , although there are seasonal variations , due to a long dry season and wet seasons in the spring and autumn in the Meseta Central . Annual rainfall in the watershed varies from around 400 millimetres ( 16 in ) to 950 millimetres ( 37 in ) , with peak precipitation in May and June .

There are frequently visiting wildfowl from the Laguna de <unk> , some 23 kilometres ( 14 mi ) away . <unk> of poplar , willow and walnut trees give plenty of shelter . The water is considered in very good condition according to the assessment of the Plan <unk> de la Cuenca del Ebro ( Hydrological Plan of the Ebro ) . 
 Further downstream in the valley between <unk> and <unk> , birdlife includes goshawks , eagles , orioles , robins , finches , hoopoe and kestrels . Deer and bobcats are found in the Sierra Santa Cruz which borders the river , hedgehogs and shrews are to be found near the banks . Trees include poplars , elm , and ash . 
 In 2000 , the Asociación <unk> de Aragón strongly condemned cleaning works by the regional government , which they said were systematically destroying riparian vegetation , killing fish and upsetting the ecology of the river in the reaches between Daroca and Calatayud .

 = Olga Constantinovna of Russia = 
 Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia ( Russian : <unk> ́ <unk> Константи ́ <unk> <unk> ́ <unk> ; IPA : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ) , later Queen Olga of the Hellenes ( Greek : <unk> <unk> των Ελλήνων ) ( 3 September [ O.S. 22 August ] 1851 – 18 June 1926 ) , was the wife of King George I of Greece and , briefly in 1920 , regent of Greece . Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , is her grandson . 
 A member of the Romanov dynasty , she was the daughter of Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich and his wife , Princess Alexandra of Saxe @-@ Altenburg . She spent her childhood in Saint Petersburg , Poland and the Crimea , and married King George I of Greece in 1867 at the age of sixteen . At first , she felt ill at ease in the Kingdom of Greece , but she quickly became involved in social and charitable work . She founded hospitals and help centers , but her attempt to promote a new , more accessible , Greek translation of the Gospels sparked riots by religious conservatives . 
 On the assassination of her husband in 1913 , Olga returned to Russia . When the First World War broke out , she set up a military hospital in Pavlovsk Palace , which belonged to her brother . She was trapped in the palace after the Russian Revolution of 1917 , until the Danish embassy intervened , allowing her to escape to Switzerland . Olga could not return to Greece as her son , King Constantine I , had been deposed . 
 In October 1920 , she returned to Athens on the fatal illness of her grandson , King Alexander . After his death , she was appointed regent until the restoration of Constantine I the following month . After the defeat of the Greeks in the Greco @-@ Turkish War of 1919 – 22 the Greek royal family were again exiled and Olga spent the last years of her life in the United Kingdom , France and Italy . 
 = = Family and early life = = 
 Olga was born at Pavlovsk Palace near Saint Petersburg on 3 September [ O.S. 22 August ] 1851 . She was the second child and elder daughter of Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich and his wife , Grand Duchess Alexandra , a former princess of Saxe @-@ Altenburg . Through her father , Olga was a granddaughter of Tsar Nicholas I , a niece of Tsar Alexander II and first cousin of Tsar Alexander III . 
 Her childhood was spent at her father 's homes , including Pavlovsk Palace and estates in the Crimea . Her father was a younger brother of Alexander II , and her mother was considered one of the most intelligent and elegant women of the court . Olga was particularly close to her older brother , Nicholas , and was one of the few members of the imperial family to keep in touch with him after he was banished to Tashkent . 
 As a child , Olga was described as a simple and chubby little girl with a broad face and big blue eyes . Unlike her younger sister , Vera , she had a calm temperament , but she was also extremely shy . For example , when interrogated by her tutors during lessons , she burst into tears and ran from the classroom . 
 In 1862 , Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich was appointed viceroy of Russian Poland by his brother and moved to Warsaw with his wife and children . The stay in Poland proved difficult for the Grand Duke , who was the victim of a nationalist assassination attempt the day after his arrival in the Polish capital . Although Constantine embarked on a program of liberalization and re @-@ instated Polish as an official language , Polish nationalists agitating for reform were not appeased . Finally , an uprising in January 1863 and the radicalization of the separatists pushed the Tsar to recall his brother in August . Olga 's difficult experiences in Poland marked her profoundly . 
 = = Engagement and marriage = = 
 The young King George I of Greece visited Russia in 1863 to thank Olga 's uncle Tsar Alexander II for his support during George 's election to the throne of Greece . Whilst there , George met the then twelve @-@ year @-@ old Olga for the first time . 
 George visited Russia again in 1867 to meet with his sister Dagmar , who had married Tsarevitch Alexander ( later Alexander III ) the year before . He was determined to find a wife and the idea of an alliance with a Russian grand duchess , born into the Eastern Orthodox Church , appealed to him . Olga fell in love with George , but she was nevertheless anxious and distraught at the thought of leaving Russia . Her father was initially reluctant to agree to their marriage , thinking that at the age of fifteen she was too young and , being close to his daughter , concerned by the distance between Greece and Russia . For her part , Grand Duchess Alexandra was much more enthusiastic than her husband and , when some members of the imperial family noted the extreme youth of her daughter , she replied that Olga would not always be as young . Eventually , it was decided that Olga and George would marry when she had reached her sixteenth birthday . Meanwhile , she would continue her schoolwork until her wedding day . 
 Olga and George married at the chapel of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg on 27 October [ O.S. 15 October ] 1867 . After five days of festivities , they spent a brief honeymoon at Ropsha , south @-@ west of Saint Petersburg . Over the following twenty years , they had eight children : 
 Constantine ( 2 August 1868 – 11 January 1923 ) , who was born ten months after the marriage of his parents ; he married Princess Sophia of Prussia and succeeded his father as king ; 
 George ( 24 June 1869 – 25 November 1957 ) , High Commissioner of Crete from 1898 to 1906 , married Princess Marie Bonaparte ; 
 Alexandra ( 30 August 1870 – 24 September 1891 ) , married Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia ; their children included Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia , one of the assassins of Grigori Rasputin ; 
 Nicholas ( 22 January 1872 – 8 February 1938 ) , married Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia ; 
 Marie ( 3 March 1876 – 14 December 1940 ) , married firstly Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia and secondly Perikles <unk> ; 
 Olga ( 7 April 1880 – 2 November 1880 ) ; 
 Andrew ( 2 February 1882 – 3 December 1944 ) , father of Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh ; and 
 Christopher ( 10 August 1888 – 21 January 1940 ) , father of Prince Michael of Greece . 
 The Tsar told Olga " to love her new country twice more than her own " , but she was ill @-@ prepared for her new life . Aware of her youth , she chose to retain the services of her governess to continue her education . On arrival at Piraeus , Olga wore blue and white , the national colors of Greece , to the delight of the crowd . On the way to the capital , popular unrest was such that Olga , who was not accustomed to such demonstrations , was close to tears . Unable to speak Greek , and with little time for rest , she attended official functions over several days . Overwhelmed , Olga was found sobbing under a staircase cuddling her teddy bear a few days after her arrival in the kingdom while she was expected for a formal event . In less than a year , she learnt Greek and English . On the advice of her mother , she took an interest in the archeology and history of Greece to gain public support . 
 = = Private life = = 
 Throughout their marriage , George I and Olga were a close @-@ knit couple , and contrary to the prevailing custom spent much time with their children , who grew up in a warm family atmosphere . With age , however , George I argued with his sons and Olga lamented the quarrels that divided the family periodically . In private , Olga and George I conversed in German because it was the only language they both spoke at the time of their marriage . With their offspring , they spoke mainly English , although the children were required to speak Greek among themselves , and Prince Andrew refused to speak anything but Greek to his parents . 
 The life of the royal family was relatively quiet and withdrawn . The Athenian court was not as brilliant and sumptuous as that of Saint Petersburg , and days in the Greek capital were sometimes monotonous for members of the royal family . In spring and winter , they divided time between the Royal Palace in Athens , and Tatoi Palace at the foot of Mount <unk> . Summers were spent on vacation at Aix @-@ les @-@ Bains in France , visiting relatives in the Russian capital or at Fredensborg and Bernstorff in Denmark , and relaxing at Mon Repos , Corfu . 
 Olga remained nostalgic for Russia . Her room was filled with icons from her homeland and , in the palace chapel , she sang Slavic hymns with her children . She often visited Russian ships that were docked at Piraeus and invited the Russian sailors to the royal palace . She was the only woman in history to bear the title of Admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy , an honor given to her on marriage . She was honored in the Greek navy by having a ship named after her . 
 = = Social work = = 
 Olga was genuinely popular and was extensively involved in charity work . On arrival in Athens , her immediate patronages included the <unk> orphanage founded by the previous queen consort Amalia of Oldenburg , and the <unk> school for girls located on University Boulevard . With her personal support and the support of wealthy donors , she built asylums for the terminally ill and for the elderly disabled , and a sanatorium for patients with consumption . She founded a society to help the poor , a kindergarten for the children of the poor , and a soup kitchen in Piraeus that doubled as a cooking school for poor girls that was later expanded into a weaving school for girls and elderly women in financial difficulty . She was patron of two military hospitals and endowed the <unk> ( Annunciation ) Hospital , Greece 's largest , in downtown Athens . She built the Russian Hospital in Piraeus in memory of her daughter , Alexandra , who died in Moscow in 1891 . Although aimed primarily at Russian sailors , the hospital was open to all seamen visiting Greece , with consultation fees set at the low rate of thirty <unk> and medicines being free . Olga also supported the establishment and funding of hospitals during the conflicts between Greece and its neighbors , including the Greco @-@ Turkish War of 1897 and the First Balkan War ( 1912 – 13 ) . For their work for the wounded , Olga and her daughter @-@ in @-@ law Crown Princess Sophia were awarded the Royal Red Cross by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in December 1897 . 
 Before Olga 's arrival in Greece , there were no separate prisons for women or the young , and she was instrumental in the establishment of a women 's prison in the capital and , with the support of wealthy philanthropist George Averoff , one for juvenile delinquents . 
 Shortly after Greece 's defeat in the Greco @-@ Turkish War of 1897 , shots were fired at Olga 's husband and daughter by disgruntled Greeks in 1898 . Despite the failed assassination , Olga insisted on continuing her engagements without a military guard . Her son Nicolas wrote in his memoirs that one day he spoke of the importance of public opinion to his mother , and she retorted , " I prefer to be governed by a well born lion rather than four hundred rats like me . " Olga 's interest in political and public opinion was limited . Although she favored Greece 's Russian party , she had no political influence over her husband and did not seek political influence in the Greek parliament . 
 = = <unk> controversy = = 
 An Orthodox Christian from birth , Queen Olga became aware , during visits to wounded servicemen in the Greco @-@ Turkish War ( 1897 ) , that many were unable to read the Bible . The version used by the Church of Greece included the Septuagint version of the Old Testament and the original Greek @-@ language version of the New Testament . Both were written in Koine Greek while her contemporaries used either Katharevousa or the so @-@ called Demotic version of Modern Greek . Katharevousa was a formal language that contained <unk> forms of modern words , was purged of " non @-@ Greek " vocabulary from other European languages and Turkish , and had a ( simplified ) archaic grammar . Modern or Demotic Greek was the version commonly spoken . Olga decided to have the Bible translated into a version that could be understood by most contemporary Greeks rather than only those educated in Koine Greek . Opponents of the translation , however , considered it " tantamount to a renunciation of Greece 's ' sacred heritage ' " . 
 In February 1901 , the translation of the New Testament from Koine into Modern Greek that she had sponsored was published without the authorization of the Greek Holy Synod . The price was set at one drachma , far below its actual cost , and the edition sold well . To mitigate opposition to the translation , both the old and new texts were included and the frontispiece specifically stated it was for " exclusive family use " rather than in church . 
 At the same time , another translation was completed by Alexandros Pallis , a major supporter of a literary movement supporting the use of Demotic in written language . Publication of the translation started in serial form in the newspaper <unk> on 9 September 1901 . Purist theologians denounced this version as " a ridiculing of the nation 's most valuable relics " and Ecumenical Patriarch Joachim III of Constantinople denounced the translation . A faction of the Greek press started accusing Pallis and his <unk> supporters of blasphemy and treason . Riots , peaking on 8 November , were started by students of the University of Athens , partly motivated by conservative professors . They demanded the excommunication of Pallis and anyone involved with the translations , including Olga and <unk> , the Metropolitan bishop of Athens , who had supervised the translation at her personal request . 
 Troops were called in to maintain order , and conflict between them and the rioters resulted in eight deaths and over sixty people wounded . By December , the remaining copies of Olga 's translation had been confiscated and their circulation prohibited . Anyone selling or reading the translations was threatened with excommunication . The controversy was called <unk> , i.e. " the Gospels question " , after the word Evangelion , Greek for " Gospel " , and led to the resignation of the metropolitan bishop , Procopius , and the fall of the government of Georgios <unk> . 
 = = Widowhood = = 
 In 1913 , the First Balkan War ended with the defeat of the Ottoman Empire by a coalition of Greek , Bulgarian , Serbian and Montenegrin forces . Greece was considerably enlarged at the expense of Turkey , but divisions between the victorious powers in the Balkan League soon became apparent : Athens and Sofia vied for possession of Thessaloniki and its region . To affirm Greek control of the main city of Macedonia , George I moved to the city soon after its conquest . Just as he did in Athens , he went about Thessaloniki without any meaningful protection force , and while out for an afternoon walk near the White Tower on 18 March 1913 , he was shot and killed by Alexandros Schinas . Olga , who said her husband 's death was " the will of God " , arrived at Thessaloniki the next day . She and her family visited the scene of the assassination and accompanied the body of the king to Athens . He was buried in the royal cemetery at Tatoi Palace . 
 George and Olga 's eldest son , Constantine , became king and his wife , Sophia of Prussia , became the new queen consort . Olga , as queen dowager , was given the use of a wing in the royal palace but soon returned to her native Russia , to spend time with her younger brother , Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich and his family at his home , and Olga 's birthplace , Pavlovsk Palace . 
 = = World War I = = 
 In August 1914 , Olga was in Russia at the outbreak of World War I , in which the Allied or Entente Powers including Russia , Britain and France fought against the Central Powers including Germany , Austria @-@ Hungary and the Ottoman Empire . She decided to stay in Saint Petersburg and establish a military hospital to support the Russian war effort . Olga created a clinic at Pavlovsk Palace where she cared for wounded soldiers with her sister @-@ in @-@ law , Grand Duchess Elizabeth <unk> . Other members of the imperial family , such as Princess Helen and Olga 's granddaughter Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna founded field hospitals at the front . As the war continued , Olga became aware of the growing crisis in Russia , and attempted to warn Tsarina Alexandra in 1916 of the danger of revolution but the Russian empress refused to listen . A few weeks later , Olga attracted the fury of the Tsarina after signing a petition asking for a pardon for her grandson , Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich , who had been exiled to the Persian front for his involvement in the assassination of Alexandra 's favorite mystic , Grigori Rasputin . 
 In contrast to Olga , her eldest son , King Constantine I of Greece , was determined to follow a policy of neutrality . His maternal relations were Russian , and his wife was the sister of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany . His policy brought him into conflict with Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos , who favored the Allies . Constantine was soon accused of being a Germanophile and the Athenian government was regarded with suspicion in London and Paris . In what became known as the National Schism , Venizelos established a parallel government in Thessaloniki in opposition to Constantine . 
 On the collapse of the Tsarist regime in February 1917 , Olga 's sister @-@ in @-@ law left Pavlovsk with her family , but Olga stayed , soon to be almost alone except for a single young domestic named Anna <unk> . ( After the Revolution , <unk> entered the service of Prince Christopher of Greece and became the governess of his son , Michael . ) Short of food , the two women were limited to eating a little dry bread soaked in poor quality oil . Their safety was far from assured , and a few days after the October Revolution , Bolsheviks invaded and ransacked the palace . Olga was physically unharmed . She accepted the need to leave Russia , but the Bolsheviks refused to let her go and diplomatic help from Greece was not forthcoming in the aftermath of the National Schism . In June , Constantine had been deposed and exiled to Switzerland . As the Allies did not wish to establish a Greek republic or see Crown Prince George succeed his father , Constantine was replaced on the throne by his second son , Alexander , who was thought to be more favorable to the Allies and more malleable than his older brother . Venizelos held power and the supporters of the deposed king were arrested or executed . 
 = = First exile = = 
 After several months of appeals for help , the Danish legation in Russia issued Olga a passport , which she used to enter Germany on the eve of its defeat , eventually joining her eldest son and his family in Switzerland in early 1919 . Other members of the Russian imperial family did not escape . Among those killed were the Tsar , Tsarina and their five children ; Olga 's brothers Grand Dukes Nicholas and Dmitri Constantinovich ; three of her nephews Princes John , Constantine and Igor Constantinovich ; and the Tsarina 's sister Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna . 
 In Switzerland , Constantine I and his family found themselves isolated and without an income . The Greek government under Venizelos did not pay pensions to former rulers and prohibited any contact between the exiles and King Alexander . Already in fragile health , the former king became gradually more depressed . The Russian Revolution and the National Schism deprived Olga of her immovable property and she was forced to live a much less lavish lifestyle than in the past . She did , however , enjoy spending more time with her sons and grandchildren , from whom she had been long separated by the war . 
 = = Regency = = 
 On 2 October 1920 , King Alexander was bitten by a monkey during a walk through the gardens at Tatoi . The wound became infected and Alexander developed septicemia . On 19 October , he began to rave and called his mother at his bedside but the Greek government refused to allow Queen Sophia to return to Greece . Worried about her son , and knowing that his grandmother was the only other royal still in favor with the Venizelists , Sophia asked Olga to go to Athens to care for Alexander . After several days of negotiations , the dowager queen obtained permission to return to Greece but , delayed by rough seas , she arrived twelve hours after her grandson 's death on 25 October . On 29 October , Alexander was buried at Tatoi ; Olga was the only member of the royal family at the funeral . 
 Still opposed to the return of Constantine I and Crown Prince George , the government of Eleftherios Venizelos offered the throne to Constantine 's third son , Prince Paul , who refused to ascend the throne before his father and older brother unless a referendum named him head of state . Only days after Alexander 's death , however , Venizelos was defeated in a general election . On 17 November , Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis , regent since the death of Alexander , retired and the new prime minister , Dimitrios Rallis , asked Olga to assume the regency . She served as regent for about a month until her son Constantine returned to the throne on 19 December after a referendum in his favor . 
 = = Second exile and death = = 
 Constantine I returned to the throne 18 months into the Greco @-@ Turkish War , launched in May 1919 . In September 1921 , the Greek defeat at the battle of Sakarya marked the beginning of the Greek retreat from Turkey . Resentment among the allies for Constantine 's policy during World War I prevented Athens from receiving outside support . Mustafa Kemal Atatürk , the new leader of Turkey , regained Smyrna and Eastern Thrace , annexed by Athens at the end of World War I. 
 Following a coup by disgruntled military officers , Constantine I abdicated for a second time on 27 September 1922 . With several other members of his family , including Queen Olga , he went into exile in Italy and his eldest son succeeded him for a few months on the throne as George II . Within months , Constantine died in Italy . One of Olga 's sons , Prince Andrew , was among those arrested by the new regime . Many defendants in the treason trials that followed the coup were shot , including senior politicians and generals . Foreign diplomats assumed that Andrew was also in mortal danger , and George V of the United Kingdom , Alfonso XIII of Spain , the French president Raymond Poincaré and Pope Pius XI sent representatives to Athens to intercede on his behalf . Andrew , though spared , was banished for life and his family fled into exile aboard a British cruiser , HMS Calypso . 
 Unlike her children and grandchildren , Olga was given a pension by the government of the Second Hellenic Republic , but she maintained so many of the faithful old servants who had fled Greece with her that she was usually left with no more than 20 pounds sterling per month ( worth about £ 900 in 2010 prices ) to meet her own expenses . She could , however , count on the support of her family , scattered throughout Western Europe . In the United Kingdom , she shared her time between Spencer House , London , the residence of her youngest son , Prince Christopher ; Regent 's Park , where her daughter , Grand Duchess Marie , rented a mansion ; Sandringham House , the home of her sister @-@ in @-@ law , Queen Alexandra ; and Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace , where her nephew , King George V , lent apartments . 
 Olga 's final years were marked by ill health . Lameness restricted her to a wheelchair , and she stayed in Paris several times to undergo treatment for her eyes . Her poor eyesight caused George V much laughter when she mistook a statue of a naked Lady Godiva for one of Queen Victoria . Increasingly dependent , Olga finally settled with her youngest son , Prince Christopher , shortly after the death of his first wife , Princess Anastasia , in 1923 . Olga died on 18 June 1926 either at Christopher 's Villa Anastasia in Rome , or at Pau , France . 
 Despite republicanism in Greece , Olga was still held in high esteem and the republican government in Athens offered to pay for her funeral and repatriate her remains to Greece . Nonetheless , her children declined the offer , preferring to bury her in Italy beside her son , Constantine I , whose body Greece had refused to accept . Her funeral was held on 22 June 1926 at the Orthodox Church in Rome and the next day she was laid to rest in the crypt of the Russian church in Florence . After the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935 she was re @-@ interred at Tatoi on 17 November 1936 . 
 As much of her property had been confiscated by the Soviet Union and the Greek republican government , most of her estate comprised jewelry reported in The Times to be worth £ 100 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to more than £ 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 today ) . This was shared between her children and the children of Constantine I. Traumatized by the events of the Russian Revolution , Olga wished to sever all ties with the country in which her family had been massacred . Before dying , she made her grandson , King George II , swear to repatriate the ashes of her daughter Princess Alexandra , buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg . Her wish was fulfilled in 1940 after his restoration to the Greek throne .

New recruits to the army were assigned to the 77th to complete their training . 
 On 1 December 1943 , the division was once again renamed . Now known as the 77th ( Holding ) Division , it was responsible for retraining soldiers who had been on medical leave . Once recruits were fully trained , and men returning from injury retrained , they were allocated to formations fighting overseas . Notably , the formation was used as a source of reinforcements for the 21st Army Group , which was fighting in Normandy . After all available British army troops left the United Kingdom for France , the division was disbanded and re @-@ formed as a deception unit to give Germany the impression that the British army had more divisions than it did . The notional 77th Division was held in reserve within the United Kingdom . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1940 , following the Second World War 's Battle of France , the United Kingdom was under threat of invasion from Nazi Germany . During the summer , the Battle of Britain dampened this threat . As the year progressed , the size of the British Army increased dramatically as 140 new infantry battalions were raised . During October , with the possibility of a German invasion during 1941 , these new battalions were formed into independent infantry brigades that were then assigned to newly created County Divisions . 
 The County Divisions , including the Devon and Cornwall County Division , were around 10 @,@ 000 men strong and assigned to defend the coastlines of threatened sections of the country , including the manning of coastal artillery . These divisions were largely static , lacking mobility and also divisional assets such as artillery , engineers , and reconnaissance forces . Using the recruits in this manner allowed the regular infantry divisions to be freed up from such duties , undertake training , and form an all @-@ important reserve that could be used to counterattack any possible German landing . 
 On 22 June , Germany launched a massive attack upon the Soviet Union ; this attack all but removed the threat of a German invasion of the United Kingdom . However , the British still had to consider the threat of a German invasion due the possibility that the Soviet Union could collapse under the German onslaught and the ease in which Germany could transfer troops back to the west . In late 1941 , the arrival of autumn and winter weather meant that the threat of invasion subsided . This , coupled with the production of new equipment for the British army , allowed the War Office to begin steps to better balance the army due to the large number of infantry units formed during the preceding year and a half . As part of this reform , the County Divisions were disbanded .

 = = = Home defence = = = 
 During the war , the divisions of the British Army were divided between " Higher Establishment " and " Lower Establishment " formations . The former were intended for deployment overseas and combat , whereas the latter were strictly for home defence in a static role . On 1 December 1941 , the Devon and Cornwall County Division was abolished and reformed as the 77th Infantry Division , a " Lower Establishment " division . The division , like its predecessor , comprised the 203rd , the 209th , and the 211th Infantry Brigades . That day , the division was assigned artillery , engineers , and signallers . An anti @-@ tank regiment and reconnaissance troops joined the following month . The war @-@ establishment , the on @-@ paper strength , of an infantry division at this time was 17 @,@ 298 men . Major @-@ General Godwin Michelmore , who had commanded the Devon and Cornwall County Division since 30 October , retained command of the division . The 77th was assigned to VIII Corps , and remained based in the Devon area . The Imperial War Museum comments that the division insignia references " Arthur 's sword Excalibur , acknowledging the [ division 's ] connections with the West Country " and its predecessor division . After the division became a training formation , the insignia was only worn by the permanent division members . 
 = = = Training formation = = = 
 During the winter of 1942 – 43 , the British Army overhauled how it would train new recruits . The 77th was one of three divisions that were changed from " Lower Establishment " units to " Reserve Divisions " . On 20 December , the division was renamed the 77th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division , becoming a training formation in the process . These three divisions were supplemented by a fourth training formation , which was raised on 1 January 1943 . The 77th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division was assigned to Northern Command . Soldiers who had completed their corps training were sent to these training divisions . The soldiers were given five weeks of additional training at the section , platoon and company level , before undertaking a final three @-@ day exercise . Troops would then be ready to be sent overseas to join other formations . Training was handled in this manner to relieve the " Higher Establishment " divisions from being milked for replacements for other units and to allow them to intensively train without the interruption of having to handle new recruits . For example , the 12th Battalion , Devonshire Regiment provided the additional training to the regiment 's new recruits before assigning them to other battalions within the regiment . 
 As part of the restructuring , the 211th Infantry Brigade was transferred to the 80th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division . The infantry brigade was replaced with the 11th Army Tank Brigade , in order to provide training facilities for the Royal Armoured Corps and retain reinforcements until they were ready to be deployed . On 1 December 1943 , the division was again re @-@ organised , and became the 77th Holding Division . As part of this restructuring , the 11th Army Tank Brigade was withdrawn . Lieutenant @-@ Colonel H.F. <unk> wrote that the division 's role was now " for sorting , retraining and holding personnel temporarily – due to disbandments , medical and other causes . " For example , as part of the change from a reserve to holding division , the 14th Battalion , Durham Light Infantry was converted from a regular infantry unit into a Rehabilitation Centre . Ex @-@ prisoners of war , repatriates , troops who were suffering from morale issues or of low physique were sent to the battalion where they underwent medical , physical , and military tests . These tests were designed to establish what medical category the soldiers should be assigned , and what job or military capability would best suit them . Likewise , soldiers returning from long periods of overseas service were sent to the 11th Battalion , York and Lancaster Regiment for retraining . 
 On 30 June 1944 , the 77th Holding , and the training divisions , had a combined total of 22 @,@ 355 men . Of these , only 1 @,@ 100 were immediately available as replacements for the 21st Army Group . The remaining 21 @,@ 255 men were considered ineligible for service abroad due to a variety of reasons , ranging from medical , not being considered fully fit , or not yet fully trained . Over the following six months , up to 75 per cent of these men would be deployed to reinforce the 21st Army Group , following the completion of their training and / or having come up to the required fitness levels . Stephen Hart comments that , by September , the 21st Army Group " had bled Home Forces dry of draftable riflemen " due to the losses suffered during the Battle of Normandy , leaving the army in Britain ( with the exception of the 52nd ( Lowland ) Infantry Division ) with just " young lads , old men , and the unfit " . On 1 September 1944 , the division was disbanded . The 45th ( Holding ) Division was then formed ( the 45th Infantry Division having been disbanded on 15 August ) by Michelmore and his headquarter staff . Michelmore assumed command , and the 45th Holding Division took over the role of the 77th Division . Roger Hesketh states the reason behind this renumbering was due to the 45th Division being a " well @-@ known territorial [ formation from ] before the war whose [ number was ] familiar to the public and [ was ] therefore of recruiting value " . 
 = = = Deception = = = 
 During 1944 , the British army was facing a manpower crisis . The army did not have enough men to replace the losses to front line infantry . While efforts were made to address this ( such as transferring men from the Royal Artillery and Royal Air Force to be retrained as infantry ) , the War Office began disbanding divisions to downsize the army so as to transfer men to other units to help keep those as close to full strength as possible . The 77th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division was one of several " Lower Establishment " divisions , within the United Kingdom , chosen to be disbanded . 
 R Force , a British deception unit , seized upon this opportunity to retain the division as a phantom unit to inflate the army 's order of battle . A cover story was established to explain the change in the division 's status . It was claimed that , with the war nearing an end , several Territorial Army divisions would revert to their peacetime recruiting role and release their equipment and resources to other units . For the 77th , this equipment would be notionally transferred from the 45th Division . With the transfer of equipment , the 77th Division was notionally raised to the " Higher Establishment " . The notional division was held in reserve , within the United Kingdom , pending a future use elsewhere .

 " Space Race " is the two @-@ part season finale of the third season of the animated comedy series Archer . It consists of the twelfth and thirteenth episodes of the season , which were initially broadcast in the United States on FX on March 15 and March 22 , 2012 , respectively . In the installment , Commander Anthony Drake ( Bryan Cranston ) urges the field agents of ISIS to travel onto the spacecraft Horizon to aid in ceasing any attacks . After entering and defeating the resistant " mutineers " , the field agents are eventually kidnapped by Drake and his aggregation , whose real objective is to colonize and populate the humans on Mars . 
 " Space Race " , which was written and directed by series creator Adam Reed , is a parody of the 1979 spy film Moonraker , the eleventh film of the James Bond cinema franchise . Additionally , the episode is instilled with multiple references to science fiction cinema , including the popular films Aliens , The Right Stuff , and Star Wars Episode IV , as well as political events such as the Cold War 's space exploration competition between the Soviet Union and the United States . Cranston guest starred in the program , alongside actor Dave Willis , who reprised his role as recurring antagonist Barry Dylan . 
 " Space Race : Part I " received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics , who praised the episode 's humor and character developments . Although it acquired positive critiques from commentators , the humor and general execution of " Space Race : Part II " was deemed inferior to its predecessor . " Space Race : Part I " garnered 1 @.@ 157 million viewers during its initial airing , while " Space Race : Part II " attained 1 @.@ 33 million viewers upon airing , consequently becoming the most viewed episode of Archer 's third season .

 = = = Part I = = = 
 The international space station Horizon sends a distress signal to the ISIS agency , stating that the spaceship has been under attack . Anthony Drake ( Bryan Cranston ) , the commander of the station , has urged ISIS to assist the crew in controlling the situation . A reluctant Lana Kane ( Aisha Tyler ) is the first one to voice concern over the issue , as none of them have undergone training in preparation for a flight . Despite these concerns , Malory Archer ( Jessica Walter ) is quick to take the job for financial gain . The field agents of ISIS — except Sterling Archer ( H. Jon Benjamin ) , who is being evaluated by Doctor <unk> Krieger ( Lucky Yates ) for medical purposes — are subjected to basic astronaut regimens in anticipation for the flight , including a flight simulator ( which Archer makes Cyril crash ) , and weightlessness training , which causes Lana to vomit copiously because of the lack of gravity . 
 ISIS is forced to quit mission training due to time constraints . After the space shuttle Intrepid exits out of the Earth 's atmosphere , Drake introduces them to the blueprints of Horizon , which is overrun with so @-@ called " mutineers " . Drake 's plan is to fight past the mutineers and link up with his men on the bridge . The group is aided with an <unk> pulse rifle , which is set into two modes : on kill mode , the weapon fires lethal plasma ammunition , while the weapon serves as a tranquilizer on stun mode . Indeed , stun mode can potentially initiate cardiac arrest , as proven when Archer accidentally shoots Cyril Figgis ( Chris Parnell ) , who is later revived after defibrillation . The trajectory of the shuttle is off course from Horizon , which is later found to be caused by Cheryl Tunt ( Judy Greer ) and Pam Poovey ( Amber Nash ) , who are being harbored in cargo . Archer is then put on probation in the hold , after shooting Pam with his pulse rifle . As the Intrepid lands on a port on the Horizon , Lana , Cyril , and Ray Gillette ( Adam Reed ) enter into the spacecraft with Drake . Being overwhelmed by the number of mutineers , Archer later joins their endeavors after being released by Pam . The party successfully makes it to the bridge , where it is revealed that Drake and his men are the real mutineers , and his real plan was to lure Lana onto the station to become breeding stock for the colonization of Mars . 
 = = = Part II = = = 
 Archer , Lana , Ray , and Cyril are subsequently kidnapped by Commander Drake and his aggregation , after finding out that his main intent was to terraform Mars . Meanwhile , Drake sends some of his crew to search for Pam , Cheryl , and Malory — who are waiting in the Intrepid . In the holding , Lana takes off her suit in order to distract the guard with her breasts . While successfully at distracting the guard , he later activates the security breach . After escaping from their holding , the group encounter a group of scientists , who inform them that Drake 's men are making their way into the Intrepid to launch towards Mars . As Cheryl <unk> Drake with her self @-@ proclaimed " Martian queen " persona , Pam takes him hostage , holding a pulse rifle to his head . 
 After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake 's mutinous crew agrees to surrender in order to prevent his death , Drake has a mental breakdown , declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam 's rifle . Cyril , startled by the sudden gunfire , opens fire himself , killing three people ( one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake ) . To worsen the situation , Barry Dylan ( Dave Willis ) challenges Archer to fight him in space . Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry , Archer ultimately declines his offer . After Archer makes an act of humility , Cyril aims the launches at Barry 's jet , subsequently stranding him on Horizon . As the group nears the airstrip , Archer , who wishes to take credit for the landing , messes with the steering shift , causing the spacecraft to crash . Afterwards , every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result , especially Ray , who is now paralyzed from the waist down ( which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season ) .

 " Space Race " was written and directed by Archer creator Adam Reed . American actor Bryan Cranston guest starred in " Space Race " as Commander Drake , an industrious and fastidious astronaut whose main objective is to fight in order to " quell a mutiny on the space platform " . Cranston 's appearance was formally announced by series creator Adam Reed in January 2012 , while being interviewed by The Huffington Post . While Reed didn 't reveal much on the background of the installment , he teased : " I love it when everybody gets to go [ on a mission ] , so a lot more people than you would think get to go to outer space . " 
 " Space Race " is imbued with various references relating to music , cinema , media , and other popular culture entities . The episode title gives homage to the synonymously named era of space exploration between the Soviet Union and the United States , which coincided during the Cold War . The episode plot gives homage to the James Bond film Moonraker ( 1979 ) . In preparation for the mission , the field agents at ISIS undergo an extensive training regimen similar to the exercise in The Right Stuff ( 1983 ) . In addition , the episode 's narrative is evocative to that of the aforementioned film , as well as the British horror film 28 Days Later ( 2002 ) . To Jesse Carp of Cinema Blend , the characters " drops weird name references " to figures such as American <unk> Charles Davenport and Grace O 'Malley . After main character Sterling Archer is sent into the space brig , he crafts an ode to The Great Escape ( 1963 ) . 
 As the second part of " Space Race " commenced , Carp asserted that Drake 's opening dialogue was nostalgic of a villainous character from the James Bond film series , particularly Hugo Drax . " ' SR : P2 ' tried to clear up this flimsy plot point from ' P1 ' during the opening ' Bond villain ' like speech from Drake , " the Cinema Blend writer iterated , " where he proclaims in a Thank You For Smoking – esque throwaway line that Lana was the perfect and only candidate for the project . " In one of Barry 's first appearances on the space station , he is taunting " Archer , come out to play " , while banging beer bottles together , directly referencing David Patrick Kelly 's Luthor in The Warriors . The design of the spaceship emulates the iconic designs of aircraft from varying films ; the trash <unk> were modeled after the Star Wars universe , while the robots were reminiscent to those in the 1986 film Aliens . As Cheryl declares herself as the " Martian queen " , she creates and sports a costumes that closely resembles Björk 's swan dress .

 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Commentators commended the first half of " Space Race " . The A.V. Club columnist Todd VanDerWerff approved of several aspects of the episode — mainly its animation , character development , and dialogue . In his A grade review , VanDerWerff felt that the producers were playful with the concepts of space . " Archer , of course , takes place in a weird blend of past and present , " he professed , " but ' Space Race ' goes out of its way to toss ' future ' into the middle of that mix as well . There are so many jokes that come just from the characters hanging out in anti @-@ gravity , for God 's sake , including a ping pong paddle strategically covering Pam 's breasts . " Commenting on the program 's animation , The A.V. Club journalist thought that its emphasis on the convergence of various science fiction techniques resulted in aesthetically pleasing visuals . VanDerWerff stated , " Everything about this one gleams , and it makes for an Archer that will almost certainly look great in HD . " Furthermore , he adulated the episode 's dialogue , avouching that even the characters with very limited screen time were given opportunities to shine with humor . Although Marcos Canales of Screen Invasion opined that " Space Race : Part I " contained far too many one @-@ liners and jokes , he praised the storyline and was keen to the character progression of Lana . " Usually , she ’ s the best agent ISIS has and can do pretty much anything , " explained Canales , " so putting her in a situation where she was not a bad ass gave the character some added depth which is something most animated shows don ’ t prioritize . " Cinema Blend 's Jesse Carp — despite criticizing the show 's " nonsensical " narrative — declared it to be hilarious . 
 Despite positive assessments , " Space Race : Part II " produced more variety within critical opinion . In his " commendable " 8 @.@ 6 out of ten rating review , Ross Bonaime of Paste asserted that the program displayed some exceptional dimension into the characters — from Lana 's apparent self @-@ consciousness , to Cheryl 's eccentric and " odd " persona , and Krieger 's past . Ultimately , Bonaime professed that " Space Race : Part II " was slightly inferior to its predecessor ; " ' Space Race , Part II ' doesn ’ t have some of the big laughs that the first part featured . By that , I mean Archer never rode Cyril through waves of Lana ’ s puke joyously . It is a step down from the first part comedically , but the episode does give us a few fun moments for each member of the cast . " Analogous sentiments were echoed by Blair Marnell of CraveOnline , who concluded : " The space adventure had some fun moments , but it seemed to lack the punch provided by the two episodes that proceeded it . Even though it was good to see Barry again this season , his appearance in this episode seemed pretty tacked on . " VanDerWerff affirmed that the episode was a superb conclusion to Archer 's third season , despite not being as " relentlessly entertaining " as " Space Race : Part I " . While deeming the episode as a hilarious finale , TV Overmind writer Kevin Fitzpatrick claimed that " Space Race : Part II " left many unanswered questions to the audience . Conversely , Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic applauded the episode , issuing it a 4 @.@ 7 out of 5 stars . " Archer ended its third season tonight with the conclusion to its two part episode , ' Space Race ' . And , man , from the second Archer announced he left his light saber in his other space pants , you knew you were in for a solid ending . " 
 Cranston 's performance was a frequent topic in the critiques . Even prior to the airing of the episode , James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the actor 's voice would be perfect for an animated television series . VanDerWerff and Carp were amongst the journalists who issued favorable assessments of Cranston 's acting . Carp noted that " Cranston 's work is even more impressive when you consider that he not only plays the hero and villain but manages to be funny as both . " In addressing " Part II " , Carp concluded that " as early as the stunning end of the world sequence , the actor plants the hint of suppressed craziness in Spaceman Drake and it was soon obvious that the just crew would not only be manning a mission to help him combat the mutineers but probably get wrapped up in this nut 's dream to terra form Mars . " For VanDerWerff , " Cranston is the very best kind of guest voice , fully inhabiting his character but also having a lot of fun with the jokes . It ’ s a nice reminder of just how funny Cranston can be , and I hope he gets even more bizarre stuff to do next week . " Jonah Gardner of Ology later said , " Bryan Cranston remains a god among men . " 
 = Keturah = 
 Keturah ( Hebrew : <unk> , Modern <unk> , Tiberian <unk> ; " Incense " ) was a wife and concubine of the Biblical patriarch Abraham . According to the Book of Genesis , Abraham married Keturah after the death of his first wife , Sarah ; Abraham and Keturah had six sons . 
 One modern commentator on the Hebrew Bible has called Keturah " the most ignored significant person in the Torah " . Some Jewish scholars have believed Keturah to be the same person as Abraham 's concubine Hagar , but this view is not universally held . 
 = = Relationship of Keturah to Abraham = = 
 Keturah is referred to in Genesis as " another wife " of Abraham ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> . : ' <unk> Translated : woman , wife ) . In First Chronicles , she is called Abraham 's " concubine " ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> . : <unk> Translated : concubine ) . Eric Lyon theorizes that " it is possible that Keturah was Abraham ’ s ' concubine ' in the beginning , and then became his ' wife ' at a later time . " 
 = = Keturah and Hagar = = 
 There is disagreement amongst Jewish scholars as to whether Keturah was , or was not , the same person as Hagar — the servant of Abraham 's wife Sarah , and Abraham 's concubine — who ( together with her son Ishmael ) was sent away by Abraham at the insistence of Sarah . 
 The discussion of Genesis 25 : 1 – 6 in the Genesis Rabbah includes statements by Rabbi Yehuda ha @-@ Nasi arguing that Hagar returned to Abraham and was renamed Keturah . Her new name ( Keturah means incense in Hebrew ) is said to refer to the pleasant aroma of incense — symbolic of her having turned from misdeeds committed during her time away from Abraham . Since Keturah is referred to in First Chronicles as Abraham 's concubine ( in the singular ) , some scholars concluded that this was why Keturah was identified with Hagar in the Midrash and the Palestinian <unk> . An alternative interpretation of the name Keturah ( based on an Aramaic root meaning " to tie " or " to adorn " ) is also cited in the Genesis Rabbah to suggest that Hagar did not have sexual relations with anyone else from the time she left Abraham until her return . The theory that Keturah was Hagar was also supported by the 11th @-@ century scholar Rashi . 
 Biblical scholar Richard Elliott Friedman dismisses the identification of Keturah with Hagar as " an old rabbinic idea " for which " there is no basis ... in the text " , and also notes that the idea was rejected by traditional commentators such as Ibn Ezra , Ramban , and <unk> . The Book of Jubilees also supports the conclusion that Keturah and Hagar were two different people , by stating that Abraham waited until after Hagar 's death before marrying Keturah . 
 = = Descendants = = 
 Keturah bore Abraham six sons : <unk> , <unk> , Medan , Midian , <unk> , and <unk> . Genesis and First Chronicles also list seven of her grandsons ( Sheba , Dedan , <unk> , <unk> , Enoch , <unk> , and <unk> ) . Keturah 's sons were said to have represented the Arab tribes who lived south and east of Palestine . 
 According to the African writer Olaudah Equiano , the 18th @-@ century English theologian John Gill believed the African people were descended from Abraham via Keturah . 
 According to the Bahá 'í author John Able , Bahá 'ís consider their founder , Bahá 'u'lláh , to have been " descended doubly , from both Abraham and Sarah , and separately from Abraham and Keturah . " 
 = National emblem of Belarus = 
 The national emblem of Belarus , which replaced the historic Pahonia arms in a 1995 referendum , features a ribbon in the colours of the national flag , a map of Belarus , wheat ears and a red star . It is sometimes referred to as the coat of arms of Belarus , although this is incorrect due to the lack of several heraldic elements . The emblem is an allusion to one that was used by the Byelorussian SSR , designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950 , with the biggest change being a replacement of the hammer and sickle with an outline map of Belarus . Emblems reminiscent of the times of the Soviet Union are also used in Macedonia , Tajikistan , Uzbekistan and the region of Transnistria . 
 The Belarusian name is Дзяржаўны <unk> Рэспублікі Беларусь , <unk> herb <unk> <unk> , and the name in Russian is <unk> <unk> Республики Беларусь , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 In 2012 the emblem has been modified .

 In the center of the emblem sits a green outline of Belarus , superimposed over the rays of a golden sun . The sun is partially covered by a globe , with the landmass ( part of Eurasia ) in purple and waters in blue . Lining the left and right sides of the emblem are stalks of wheat , superimposed with flowers . <unk> adorn the left wheat stalks ; flax flowers adorn the right . Wrapped around the wheat stalks is a red and green ribbon bearing the colours of the flag of Belarus ; the ribbon meets at the base of the emblem , where the name Republic of Belarus ( <unk> Беларусь ) is inscribed in gold in the Belarusian language . At the top of the emblem there is a five @-@ pointed red star . 
 = = = Symbolism = = = 
 The elements that comprise the state emblem are not tied to any " official " symbolism . The design of the emblem of the Byelorussian SSR was used as the basis for the current Belarusian emblem ; the primary difference between the two is that the Byelorussian SSR emblem contains more references to Communism , such as the Communist symbol of hammer and sickle and pure red ribbon , which the modern emblem does not , replaced with the outline and the flag of Belarus , respectively , however it still retains the communist red star , the globe and the wheat bundles , which are also typical of Soviet emblems and still is very Soviet in nature . 
 = = = Legislation = = = 
 The current law regulating the design and use of the Belarusian emblem was passed on July 5 , 2004 . Article 9 of Chapter 3 of Law No. 301 @-@ 3 begins by describing the official drawing of the Belarusian arms and regulates on its proper design . Officially , the arms can be drawn in full colour , monochrome or using two colors . Article 10 states that the national emblem must be displayed at specified locations on a continual basis , such as the residences of the Belarusian leader , the chamber of the National Assembly and at governmental offices of national and regional levels . The emblem can also be used on documents issued by the government , including money , passports and official letterheads . 
 The law also restricts the use of the emblem in other contexts — e.g. cities , towns or oblasts may not adopt a coat of arms or emblem using the national emblem either completely or in part . Furthermore , organizations not listed in the Law on State Symbols may only use the emblem by permission . The emblem can be used by both foreigners and citizens of Belarus , as long as the symbol is displayed with respect , although citizens may not use the state emblem on letterheads or business cards if they are not agents of the government . 
 In addition to standard usages listed in the law , the emblem has been used in various other circumstances . The emblem is displayed , along with the national flag , at the beginning and the end of a video clip with the Belarusian anthem My Belarusy , regularly played on Belarusian television . Another use of the emblem is on ballot boxes and campaign mailings used during national and local elections . The emblem also appears on Belarus 's border posts .

 = = = Pahonia = = = 
 The Pahonia was used as an official coat of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since 1366 after being first used as the personal arms of Algirdas , the Grand Duke of Lithuania . The arms continued to be used until Grand Duchy of Lithuania were annexed by the Russian Empire in 1795 , though the arms was incorporated into the Imperial coat of arms . The idea of return to the historic national symbol was pursued by Belarusian poet Maksim <unk> in his poem " Pahonia " . The arms was again used in 1918 when the short @-@ lived Belarusian People 's Republic used the Pahonia as part of their emblem . 
 More recently , the Pahonia was the official coat of arms starting in 1991 , when Belarus declared itself independent of the Soviet Union . It was replaced by the current emblem following a controversial referendum held in 1995 . 
 Since it was dropped as the official emblem of Belarus , opposition groups such as the Belarusian People 's Front have used the Pahonia as part of their own party symbols or used them as a form of protest against Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko . 
 = = = Emblem of the Byelorussian SSR = = = 
 From 1920 until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 , the Byelorussian SSR used an emblem instead of a coat of arms . The first emblem used by Soviet Byelorussia was adopted in 1919 and is similar to the contemporary insignia of the Russian and Ukrainian republics . The central part of the emblem is a stylized red shield , showing a golden sun rising from the base . Above the sun is a crossed golden hammer and sickle , symbolizing unity between workers and peasants . Above the hammer and sickle , the letters <unk> are shown in black , denoting the name of the republic . БССР ( <unk> ) is an abbreviation for the full name of the republic ; " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " , the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic . The shield is framed by ears of wheat meeting at the its base and featuring a red ribbon inscribed in black with the state motto of the Soviet Union , " Workers of the World , Unite ! " The text is written in the Belarusian language . 
 In 1937 , this emblem was replaced by a new one , removing the shield and including more text . The right side of the emblem features oak leaves and the left features wheat ears with clovers placed on top . In the center of the emblem , a sun is rising behind a profile of Earth . A hammer , sickle and red star appears over the sun . Around the ears of wheat and leaves of oak is a red ribbon , featuring the phrase " Workers of the World , Unite ! " written ( from left to right ) in Belarusian , Yiddish , Polish and Russian . The initials <unk> are shown at its base denoting the name of the republic . Ten years before in 1927 , the arms was the same except for the wording on the bottom ribbon . Instead of the letters reading БССР , the letters read " <unk> " , which stood for the Soviet Socialist Republic of Byelorussia . 
 This emblem was in turn replaced by a new one in 1950 . The central feature of this symbol is a crossed hammer and sickle , a universal Communist symbol symbolizing the unity of workers and peasants . Below this symbol , a sun is shown rising behind a globe . The insignia is framed by ears of wheat , each ear ending in flowers ; clover on the left and flax on the right . A red ribbon is wrapped around the ears of wheat , reminiscent of the red flag used by the Communist movement . The base of the emblem shows the letters БССР . The ribbon features the phrase Workers of the World , Unite ! The left side inscribed in Belarusian , the right side in Russian . The red star of Communism is featured above the hammer and sickle . The 1950 version was designed by Ivan Dubasov , a People 's Artist of the USSR . Article 119 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR defines the design of the emblem .

 On May 14 , 1995 , a referendum was conducted in all regions of Belarus . Out of four questions , one was the following : " Do you support the introduction of the new national symbols ? " With a voter turnout of 64 @.@ 7 % , the new state symbols were approved by a ratio of 3 : 1 ( 75 @.@ 1 % to 24 @.@ 9 % ) . The way the referendum was carried out was heavily criticized by the opposition , including the exact wording of the question about the national insignia . Supporters of the Pahonia also criticize that the Pahonia and the former white @-@ red @-@ white flag were compared to ones , used by collaboration forces , in propaganda that was published during the run @-@ up to the vote . The comparison was made due to the white , red , white flag and Pahonia being used on the patches and symbols of the Belarusian Central Rada , the Belarusian government under the control of Nazi Germany . Alexander Lukashenko claimed the selection of the Soviet @-@ inspired symbols as a victory , especially to his Great Patriotic War veteran base , by saying " we have returned to you the flag of the country for which you fought . We have returned to you both memory and a sense of human pride . "

 Gears of War 2 is a 2008 military science fiction third @-@ person shooter video game developed by Epic Games and published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360 . It is the second installment of the Gears of War series , with lead design by Cliff Bleszinski , . The game was officially released in North America , Europe and Australia on November 7 , 2008 and was released in Japan on July 30 , 2009 . The game expands technically on the previous game by using a modified Unreal Engine 3 engine . The development team brought in comic book writer Joshua Ortega to help write the plot for the game . 
 In Gears of War 2 , the COG continues its fight against the Locust horde , who are attempting to sink all of the cities on the planet Sera . Sergeant Marcus Fenix leads Delta Squad into the depths of the planet to try to stop the Locust during the assault upon Locust territory . The player controls Fenix in the main mission campaign , with the ability to play cooperatively with a second player controlling Fenix 's best friend and fellow Squad member Dominic " Dom " Santiago . The game includes several existing and new multiplayer modes including five @-@ on @-@ five battles between human and Locust forces , and a " Horde " mode that challenges up to five players against waves of Locust forces with ever @-@ increasing strength . New weapons and gameplay mechanics such as " chainsaw duels " and the ability to use downed foes as " <unk> " were added to the game . 
 On its release weekend , Gears of War 2 sold over two million copies , and within two months of release , had sold four million copies . It was the seventh best selling video game of 2009 and received several accolades . The game received similar praise as its predecessor , with the new gameplay and multiplayer modes seen as outstanding additions . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Gears of War 2 is a third person shooter with an emphasis on the tactical use of cover , and retains much of the same gameplay from the first game . The player , playing as either Marcus or Dominic in the campaign mode , or as any of the human or Locust characters in multiplayer mode , can only carry a pistol , one type of grenade , and two other weapons at any time , though they may swap these for weapons found in strategic locations or left by downed foes or fallen allies . Each weapon can be used for normal fire as well as for melee attacks ; the game 's signature Lancer , an assault rifle mounted with a chainsaw bayonet for its melee , can be used to instantly kill foes . The game introduces the ability to engage in chainsaw duels should the player attempt to chainsaw an opponent also using the Lancer ; the player is presented with a controller button to press rapidly to try to win the duel and avoid death . Gears of War 2 rebalances the power of the existing weapons while introducing five new ones : a flamethrower , a chain gun , a mortar cannon , a " Gorgon " Pistol , and the Ink Grenade . The chain gun and the mortar are heavy weapons , forcing the player to move at walking speed while carrying it in both hands . The Gorgon Pistol is an SMG @-@ like machine pistol that fires four four @-@ shot bursts per magazine . The Ink Grenade doesn 't damage with its detonation , but instead temporarily poisons the area it was thrown , making it very useful for driving enemies out of cover . Grenades can be planted on walls or floors as proximity traps that go off when an enemy nears , but only fragmentation grenades have the ability to kill foes when they go off . 
 The player 's health is represented by a red " Crimson Omen " that fades onto the screen the more damage the player takes ; staying out of the line of fire allows the player to recover their health . Depending on the game mode or difficulty , if the player takes too much damage , they enter a downed state where they can crawl around the map to get out of battle and seek help . During this time , a teammate can revive him , an enemy may brutally execute the downed player , or the player may bleed out if too much time has passed . The player can also grab a downed character and use them as a <unk> , allowing the body to absorb damage but forcing the player to use a one @-@ handed pistol . Explosive weapons will simply destroy the character they strike . Like its predecessor , Gears of War 2 features an optional mature content filter , which , when active , makes blood appear as sparks and removes harsh language from the dialogue . Furthermore , progress towards most of the Xbox achievements for the game can be earned in either campaign or multiplayer modes . 
 = = = Campaign mode = = = 
 The campaign mode in Gears of War 2 allows for a single player or two players playing cooperatively as Marcus or Dom . A new " Normal " difficulty was added between the game 's " Casual " and " Hardcore " difficulties . There is also an ' Insane ' difficulty that is unlocked after the player completes the game at least once . Players in co @-@ op mode can select different difficulties , and a " communal combat system " will adjust the game 's artificial intelligence to give both players a fair challenge . The co @-@ op campaign can be played in a drop in / drop out manner , with the second player able to join the first player 's game in progress . As well as collecting some COG tags as in the first game , players can search other story @-@ based items such as personal letters and medical records , with discovered items being added to a war journal . 
 The campaign features a deeper story with new characters , new weapons , and new enemies according to John DiMaggio , the voice actor for Marcus Fenix . New vehicles have been added to the game , such as the Centaur Tank , which lead designer Cliff Bleszinski describes as a " tank with monster truck wheels . " Players will also ride a Brumak and Reavers in the game . Cut @-@ scenes use the better facial rendering technology of Epic 's Unreal engine , and engage in more dramatic angles for the conversation , as well as using a video screen on Jack ( the all @-@ purpose robot used by Delta squad ) to talk with their commanders face @-@ to @-@ face . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Gears of War 2 features an upgraded multiplayer mode that allows up to ten users to simultaneously play in teams of five @-@ on @-@ five . Gears of War 2 includes most of the multiplayer modes , including Execution , <unk> , Annex and King of the Hill , and adds in three new modes . Guardian is a modified version of Assassination from the original Gears of War , but allows players to continue fighting after the leader has been killed , but losing the ability to respawn . Wingman splits all ten players into five teams of two , where both members of a team play as the same character . Submission , formerly known as Meat Flag , is a version of capture the flag in which players attempt to " down " an enemy controlled by the game 's AI and move its body to their team 's base or objective to earn points . The 10 maps shipped with the game originally are Avalanche , Blood Drive , Day One , Hail , Jacinto , Pavilion , River , Ruins , Security and <unk> A Halo @-@ like matchmaking system has been utilized for the online multiplayer Players can now engage in multiplayer scenarios with any combination of human players and artificial intelligence controlled by the game , with the ability to set the AI 's intelligence level . Horde is a new co @-@ op mode for five players , fighting off waves of attacking Locust together , with each wave becoming more difficult . Horde Mode does not feature bot support as in competitive multiplayer , and can be played alone . 
 Players can pan around a map as the camera focuses on areas of intense fighting , and the Ghost Cam allows a player to roam freely around a map . The ability to take photographs is also featured , which enables the player to take a photo , which can be uploaded to the official Gears of War website and is rated on the quality of action in the shot .

 Gears of War 2 takes place six months after the detonation of the <unk> Bomb at the end of the first game . Though most of the underground army of the Locust Horde was destroyed , the explosion also caused much of the liquid <unk> underground to vaporize , causing a fatal disease called <unk> to spread among the diminished human population . After months of peace , the cities of <unk> and <unk> suddenly and mysteriously disappear underground , leading the Coalition of Ordered Governments ( COG ) to suspect the resurgence of the Locust . Soon after , the once impenetrable Jacinto , one of the last remaining safe havens for humans , begins to show signs that the same fate awaits it . To stop the fall of Jacinto , the COG responds with a large @-@ scale counter @-@ offensive against the Locust . Senior Producer Rod Fergusson says " In order to save Jacinto , [ the COG ] have no choice but to take the war to the Locust . " 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 Returning characters includes the main protagonists of the series Marcus Fenix and Dominic ( Dom ) Santiago and others from the first game , including Marcus and Dom 's fellow Delta Squad COG soldiers , Augustus ' Cole Train ' Cole and Damon Baird . Also returning in supporting roles are radio dispatcher Anya Stroud and senior officer Colonel Hoffman . Lead designer Cliff Bleszinski confirmed that the character Carmine would be returning , but did not reveal how or in what capacity as Carmine was killed in the original Gears of War . It was later revealed that the original Anthony Carmine would not be present in the Gears of War 2 campaign , but rather his brother , Benjamin , would make an appearance . The game also introduces several new characters . They include Chairman Prescott , the noble , yet near @-@ dictatorial military leader of COG ; Tai <unk> , " a spiritual and meditative warrior from a tradition of honor bound fighters ; " and Dizzy Wallin , a former Stranded who joined the COG to keep his family safe . Dom 's wife Maria also makes an appearance , and Dom 's search for her plays an important part in the story . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 As Gears of War 2 begins , the COG army is mobilizing to send forces into the depths of Sera to assault the Locust directly . The COG deploy several units into the Locust Tunnels , known as ' The Hollow ' , despite sustaining heavy casualties . Delta Squad , consisting of Marcus Fenix , Dom Santiago , Benjamin Carmine and later Augustus Cole and Damon Baird , continues to search the Hollow and discovers that the Locust are using a giant <unk> to sink the human occupied cities . The Locust plan to destroy the rock structures at the outskirts of Jacinto , the last major Human city , in hopes of sinking it into the ground . 
 Delta Squad kills the <unk> before it can sink Jacinto and returns to the surface . They are ordered to investigate a nearby abandoned COG outpost where they encounter experimented creatures of unknown origin and learn of a back door entrance to the Hollow in the nearby <unk> Mountains . They find prisoner cages and Dom convinces Marcus that Maria ( Dom 's wife ) must be inside one of them . They manage to find her , but the Locust imprisonment and torture has left her severely disfigured and traumatized , unable to communicate . Faced with the nigh @-@ vegetative state Maria is in , Dom tearfully chooses to euthanize her . Marcus and Dom then charge into the Locust stronghold . 
 Inside , Delta Squad discovers the Locust Horde is locked in a civil war against the " Lambent , " or a group of Locust who have been exposed to <unk> . They decide to destroy both the Locust and Lambent forces by detonating a bomb under Jacinto , which will sink the city and flood the Locust tunnels . Marcus and Dom battle their way through the Locust tunnels , while Cole and Baird use a helicopter to transport a bomb into the cavern . A Lambent Brumak destroys the bomb before it can be detonated . Marcus improvises by using a satellite targeting solution to bombard the Brumak with an orbital laser , which causes it to violently explode . Jacinto begins to sink and sea @-@ water floods into the sinkhole , destroying the remaining Locust forces . As the COG forces and civilians evacuate , a voiceover of the Locust Queen talks about unintended legacies . After the credits , a last voice over of Adam Fenix is heard , a radio transmission of a call for help , and a cry of desperation , revealing he is still alive .

 Gears of War designer Cliff Bleszinski has done several interviews to highlight improvements to the game . Heavy <unk> optimization has been done to negate the host advantage problem in the first title and hundreds of tweaks have gone into improving the cover system and movement . To provide a deeper story , the team brought aboard novelist Joshua Ortega as to incorporate more personal drama within the sci @-@ fi setting . Steve Jablonsky provided the music for the game . Epic Games also considered making the game easier after complaints about Gears of War . Senior producer Rod Fergusson admitted that — for the first game — " We overshot on [ the Casual ] difficulty and a game that was a little harder than we intended . " 
 A teaser image posted to the Gears of War 2 website on July 8 , 2008 suggested that the game was to be released on November 9 , 2008 , but it was confirmed during the Microsoft E3 2008 press conference that the game would be released on November 7 , 2008 . On July 14 , 2008 , the teaser image was removed and the official website relaunched and updated for Gears of War 2 . 
 Gears of War 2 was a focal point during Microsoft 's E3 2008 presentation on July 15 , 2008 , which included a " hands @-@ on " demo . A second trailer , entitled " Rendezvous , " was made available on July 14 , 2008 as a part of E3 . The Joseph Kosinski @-@ directed trailer , which features the Trans Am track " Diabolical Cracker " from the album Red Line , takes its title and spoken words from Alan Seeger 's World War I poem I Have a Rendezvous with Death . The game 's release date was also set , with a worldwide release to occur on November 7 , 2008 . Microsoft and Epic Games announced on October 10 , 2008 that Gears of War 2 had gone gold . It was stated by Cliff Bleszinski that , unlike Gears of War , the previous installment , Gears of War 2 will not feature a PC port .

 At the 2008 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco , California , as a showcase for the functionality of the Unreal Engine 3 , Gears of War creators Epic Games showed various improvements to the engine with specific reference to the sequel itself . The video showed several demonstrations of the improvements , the initial being improvements to the in @-@ game lighting through Screen Space Ambient <unk> , in which dynamic shadows could be generated through the use of a pixel shading technique to render more realistically lit and shaded objects and actors , illustrated through comparison between character and environment models in the original game engine to that of Unreal Engine 3 . Also showcased was the ability of the engine to render hordes of actors within the engine , as demonstrated with a large crowd of locust flocking through the " Gridlock " multiplayer map from the original game . Alongside this technology was improvements to " Matinee , " an artistic tool used for the rendering and editing 3 @-@ dimensional scenes within the game . 
 Other physics @-@ related features included improvements to the rendering of water in which specular light and physical interactions with were displayed more realistically , improvements to soft body entities demonstrated with a " Meat Cube " and a floating ball possessing properties similar to that of liquid helium . The largest of these physics engine related changes was the introduction of destructible environments due to the implementation of real @-@ time structural analysis tools to generate the damage of the materials and subsequently their deformed shapes based upon resultant forces placed upon them . This was demonstrated with the use of explosive arrows fired from the " Torque Bow " of the original game causing damage to wooden planks , and also revealing rebar present after destroying areas of a stone structure .

 Gears of War 2 received wide critical acclaim . It currently holds a 93 @.@ 32 % aggregate review score at Game Rankings , and a 93 / 100 from the aggregate review website Metacritic . 
 While the game has been praised for the addition of a deeper plot than the original Gears of War and being highly polished , reviewers noted that the multiplayer experience did not resemble the previous game especially in its quick pace and enjoyability . IGN noted that while the first four acts of the game were satisfying , in the final act " the last boss is a complete joke and the ending feels just a tad too abrupt , " and that there were some bugs and lag in the online multiplayer . Overall , IGN stated that " [ Gears of War 2 ] has its flaws when it comes to the technical side of multiplayer and the last act of the campaign and the voice acting might turn some off . Still , none of that comes close to holding back Gears of War 2 from its destiny : being one of the best games available on the Xbox 360 . " Also , even though the new plot was praised , critics such as Official Xbox Magazine scrutinized the game 's middle acts saying that most of the plot " falls flat . " 
 Both IGN and Eurogamer , among others , positively mentioned the new " Horde Mode " feature , with Eurogamer saying that " Horde is a weighty slab of fun that can turn almost any of them into a time @-@ sink , and the leaderboards are likely to be as compelling a reason to stick with Gears of War 2 as the leveling system has been for Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare . " X @-@ Play praised the game for its " polished cover system " and cooperative campaign mode . X @-@ Play also praised the new weapons and characters and its " brilliant " multiplayer experience . Game Informer called the single @-@ player campaign " satisfying " and called the co @-@ op campaign amazing and goes on to call online multiplayer " an outstanding contrast to team deathmatch or capture @-@ the @-@ flag scenarios .

 = Sukhoi Su @-@ 33 = 
 The Sukhoi Su @-@ 33 ( Russian : <unk> Су @-@ 33 ; NATO reporting name : Flanker @-@ D ) is an all @-@ weather carrier @-@ based twin @-@ engine air superiority fighter designed by Sukhoi and manufactured by Komsomolsk @-@ on @-@ Amur Aircraft Production Association , derived from the Su @-@ 27 " Flanker " and initially known as the Su @-@ 27K . Compared with the Su @-@ 27 , the Su @-@ 33 has a strengthened undercarriage and structure , folding wings and stabilators , all for carrier operations . The Su @-@ 33 has canards and its wings are larger than than the Su @-@ 27 for increased lift . The Su @-@ 33 has upgraded engines and a twin nose wheel , and is air <unk> . 
 First used in operations in 1995 aboard the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov , the fighter officially entered service in August 1998 , by which time the designation " Su @-@ 33 " was used . Following the break @-@ up of the Soviet Union and the subsequent downsizing of the Russian Navy , only 24 aircraft were produced . Attempted sales to China and India fell through . With plans to retire the Su @-@ 33 once they reach the end of their service life , the Russian Navy ordered the MiG @-@ 29K as a replacement in 2009 .

 = = = Background and origins = = = 
 During the 1970s , the Yakovlev Yak @-@ 38 , then the Soviet Navy 's only operational carrier @-@ based fixed @-@ wing combat aircraft , was found to be unable to undertake its role due to limited range and payload , which severely hampered the capability of the Soviet Navy 's Project 1143 carriers . It was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating STOL aircraft . During the assessment period , a number of carriers were studied ; the Project 1160 carrier would have been able to operate the MiG @-@ 23s and Su @-@ 24s , but was abandoned due to budget constraints . Design efforts were then concentrated on the Project 1153 carrier , which would have accommodated the Su @-@ 25s and the proposed MiG @-@ <unk> and Su @-@ 27Ks . Sufficient funding was not secured , and the Navy looked at the possibility of a fifth , and larger , Project 1143 carrier , modified to allow for Yak @-@ 141 , MiG @-@ 29K and Su @-@ 27K operations . 
 To prepare for the operations of the Su @-@ 27K and the rival MiG @-@ 29K on @-@ board the new carrier , work proceeded on the development of the steam catapult , arresting gear , optical and radio landing systems . The pilots were trained at a new establishment in Crimea , named NITKA , for Aviation Research and Training Complex . In 1981 , the Soviet government ordered the abandonment of the catapult system as part of an overall downsize of Project 1143 @.@ 5 carriers , which also included cancelling the fifth Project 1143 carrier and the Varyag . A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex , where takeoffs would be executed to ensure that the Su @-@ 27Ks and MiG @-@ 29Ks would be able to operate from carriers . Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp . Three Sukhoi <unk> ( − 3 , − 24 and − 25 ) , along with an Su @-@ <unk> , were used for takeoffs from the simulated ramp . The first of these tests were undertaken by Nikolai <unk> on 28 August 1982 . Flight tests indicated the need for a change in ramp design , and it was modified to a ski @-@ jump profile . 
 Conceptual designs of the Su @-@ 27K commenced in 1978 . On 18 April 1984 , the Soviet government instructed Sukhoi to develop an air defence fighter ; Mikoyan was ordered to build a lighter multirole fighter . Full @-@ scale design of the Su @-@ 27K soon started as the " T @-@ 10K " under the guidance of Konstantin <unk> . Nikolai <unk> was appointed the design bureau 's Chief Test Pilot for the programme . By November 1984 , conceptual design had passed its critical design review , with the detailed design finalised in 1986 . The two prototypes were constructed in conjunction with KnAAPO in 1986 – 1987 . 
 = = = Testing = = = 
 The first Su @-@ 27K prototype , piloted by Viktor Pugachyov , made its maiden flight on 17 August 1987 at the NITKA facility ; the second followed on 22 December . Flight tests continued at NITKA , where Su @-@ 27Ks and MiG @-@ 29Ks demonstrated and validated the feasibility of ski @-@ jump operations . The pilots also practised no @-@ flare landings before making an actual landing on a carrier deck . It was another two years before the Tbilisi , subsequently renamed Admiral Kuznetsov , left the shipyard . 
 Viktor Pugachyov , piloting the second Su @-@ 27K , became the first Russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 November 1989 . It was found that the carrier 's jet blast deflectors were too close to the engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60 ° ; thus an improvised solution held the deflectors at 45 ° . However , when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds , the shield 's water pipes exploded . The pilot , Pugachyov , reduced engine throttle , accidentally causing the <unk> ( blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating ) to retract and the fighter to move forwards . The aircraft was quickly stopped ; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast deflectors or <unk> . Since then , a Kamov Ka @-@ <unk> search @-@ and @-@ rescue helicopter was flown close to the carrier in the event of an accident . 
 During the following three @-@ week period , 227 sorties were amassed , along with 35 deck landings . Flight testing continued afterwards , and on 26 September 1991 , naval pilots began testing the Su @-@ 27K ; by 1994 , it had successfully passed the State Acceptance Trials . During 1990 – 1991 , seven production aircraft were rolled out . 
 = = = Further developments = = = 
 The first of two known versions of the Su @-@ 33 , the twin @-@ seat Su @-@ <unk> , made its first flight in April 1999 . The aircraft , piloted by Viktor Pugachyov and Sergey Melnikov , flew for 40 minutes near Ramenskoye Airport . The Su @-@ <unk> ( Initially named as Su @-@ <unk> , " <unk> Uchebno @-@ <unk> " , or " carrier combat trainer " ) was planned to be a trainer , but with the potential to fill other roles . Notable improvements over the Su @-@ 33 included a revised forward fuselage and leading edge slats , bigger wings and stabilators 
 In 2010 , Sukhoi developed an updated version of the Su @-@ 33 ; flight trials began in October 2010 . This modernised Su @-@ 33 was to compete with a potential Chinese indigenous version of the original Su @-@ 33 , and to encourage orders from the Russian Navy . Major upgrades to the aircraft included more powerful ( 132 kN , 29 @,@ 800 lbf ) AL @-@ 31 @-@ F @-@ M1 engines and a larger weapons carriage ; upgrades to the radar and weapons were not possible at the time due to funding constraints . According to military author Richard Fisher , it has been speculated that further modifications to a new production batch would include a phased @-@ array radar , thrust @-@ vectoring nozzles , and long @-@ range anti @-@ ship missiles . 
 = = Design = = 
 To adapt the original Su @-@ 27 for naval operations , Sukhoi first incorporated a reinforced structure and undercarriage to withstand the great stress experienced upon landing , particularly quick descents and non @-@ flare landings ( landings where the aircraft does not ' float ' and slow its decent rate just prior to touchdown ) . The leading edge slats , flaperons and other control surfaces are enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds , although the wingspan remains unchanged . The wings feature double @-@ slotted flaps and outboard drooping ailerons ; in total , the refinements enlarge the wing area by 10 – 12 % . The wings and stabilators are modified for folding to maximise the number of aircraft the carrier can accommodate and to allow ease of movement on deck . The aircraft is outfitted with more powerful turbofan engines to increase thrust @-@ to @-@ weight ratio , as well as an in @-@ flight refuelling probe . The Su @-@ 33 sports canards that shorten the take @-@ off distance and improve manoeuvrability , but have required reshaping of the leading edge root extensions ( LERX ) . The rear radome is shortened and reshaped to prevent its striking the deck during high @-@ Alpha ( angle of attack ) landings . 
 Compared with the rival MiG @-@ 29K , the Su @-@ 33 's maximum takeoff weight ( MTOW ) is 50 % higher ; fuel capacity is more than double , allowing it to fly 80 % further at altitude ( or 33 % at sea level ) . The MiG @-@ 29K can spend as much time as the Su @-@ 33 on station by using external fuel tanks , but this limits its ordnance capacity . The Su @-@ 33 can fly at speeds as low as 240 km / h ( 149 mph ) , in comparison the MiG @-@ 29K needs to maintain a minimum of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) for effective control . However , the MiG @-@ 29K carries more air @-@ to @-@ ground munitions than the Su @-@ 33 . The Su @-@ 33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG @-@ 29K , limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier . 
 The Su @-@ 33 carries guided missiles such as the R @-@ 73 ( four ) and R @-@ <unk> ( six ) on twelve hardpoints , supplemented by the 150 @-@ round 30 mm GSh @-@ 30 @-@ 1 . It can carry an assortment of unguided rockets , bombs and cluster bombs for secondary air @-@ to @-@ ground missions . The aircraft can be used in both night and day operations at sea . The radar used , " Slot Back " , has been speculated to have poor multi @-@ target tracking , making the Su @-@ 33 reliant on other radar platforms and airborne warning and control system ( AWACS ) aircraft like the Kamov Ka @-@ 31 early @-@ warning helicopter . The R @-@ <unk> missiles have the capability to intercept anti @-@ ship missiles . The infra @-@ red search and track ( IRST ) system is placed to provide better downward visibility .

 The Su @-@ 27K entered service in the mid @-@ 1990s . From December 1995 to March 1996 , the Admiral Kuznetsov set sail in the Mediterranean Sea , carrying two Su @-@ <unk> , nine Ka @-@ 27s , and 13 Su @-@ 27Ks . However , the aircraft officially entered service 31 August 1998 with the 279th Naval Fighter Regiment of the Northern Fleet based at Severomorsk @-@ 3 , by which time it was officially designated the " Su @-@ 33 " . The Russian Navy currently operates 19 Su @-@ 33s , however in the long term these need to be replaced . 
 With the break @-@ up of the Soviet Union , the Russian Navy was dramatically downsized , with many shipbuilding programmes stopped . Had the Varyag , Oryol and Ulyanovsk been commissioned , a total of 72 production airframes would have been built ; the early @-@ airborne warning and MiG @-@ 29K would also have proceed , instead of being abandoned . Only 24 examples were built at the time Varyag was sold to China . In 2009 , the Russian Navy announced an order for 24 MiG @-@ 29Ks to replace the Su @-@ 33 , to be delivered from 2011 to 2015 . However , in 2015 , Major @-@ General Igor <unk> , the Commander of the Navy 's Air and Air Defense Forces , announced that a second fighter regiment would be formed to augment the current force , with the intention that the MiG @-@ 29s be used by this new unit , with the existing Su @-@ 33s refurbished for further use .

 Internationally , the People ’ s Republic of China was identified as a possible export customer . Russia 's state weapons exporter , Rosoboronexport , was previously negotiating an order of 50 aircraft totalling US $ 2 @.@ 5 billion . China would have initially acquired two aircraft worth $ 100 million for testing and then have further options to acquire an additional 12 – 48 aircraft . The fighters were intended to be used with the fledgling Chinese aircraft carrier programme , with the former Soviet carrier Varyag as the centrepiece . 
 At the sixth Zhuhai Airshow in late 2006 , Lieutenant General Aleksander <unk> publicly confirmed at a news conference that China had approached Russia for the possible purchase of Su @-@ 33s , and negotiations were to start in 2007 . On 1 November 2006 , the Xinhua News Agency published the information on its military website that China planned to introduce the Su @-@ 33 . China had previously obtained a manufacturing license for Su @-@ 27 production . 
 Sukhoi is working on a more advanced version , the Su @-@ <unk> , a development to integrate the advanced technologies of the Su @-@ 35 fighters into the older Su @-@ 33 airframe . However , worries over other Chinese intentions emerged when it was reported that China had acquired one of the T @-@ <unk> , an Su @-@ 33 prototype , from Ukraine , potentially to study and reverse engineer a domestic version . Various aircraft are alleged to have originated partially from the Su @-@ 33 , such as the Shenyang J @-@ 11B and the Shenyang J @-@ 15 . Photos of Shenyang aircraft designers posing in front of a T @-@ 10K carrier based fighter prototype strongly suggest that the J @-@ 15 is directly related to T @-@ 10K . Negotiations stagnated as the Shenyang Aircraft company sought to reduce Russian content in the aircraft , while Sukhoi wanted to ensure a level of income from future upgrades and modifications made to the J @-@ 11 . 
 India was also viewed as another potential operator of the Su @-@ 33 . The Indian Navy planned to acquire the Su @-@ 33 for its aircraft carrier , the INS Vikramaditya , the refurbished Soviet Admiral <unk> , which was sold to India in 2004 . In the end , the rival MiG @-@ 29K was opted for , because of the Su @-@ 33 's outdated avionics . The size of the Su @-@ 33 reportedly led to concerns over potential difficulties in operating it off the Indian carriers , a constraint not shared by the smaller MiG @-@ 29K .

 = Gazelle @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Gazelle class was a group of ten light cruisers built for the Imperial German Navy at the turn of the 20th century . They were the first modern light cruiser design of the Imperial Navy , and set the basic pattern for all future light cruisers in Imperial service . The design of the Gazelle class attempted to merge the fleet scout with the colonial cruiser . They were armed with a main battery of ten 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns and a pair of torpedo tubes , and were capable of a speed of 21 @.@ 5 knots ( 39 @.@ 8 km / h ; 24 @.@ 7 mph ) . 
 All ten ships served with the fleet when they were first commissioned , and several served on foreign stations in the decade before the outbreak of World War I. Most were used as coastal defense ships early in the war . Ariadne was sunk at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914 , Undine was torpedoed in the Baltic by a British submarine in November 1915 , and Frauenlob was sunk at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 . The rest survived the war to see service with the Reichsmarine , with the exception of Gazelle , which was broken up in 1920 . 
 Niobe was sold to Yugoslavia in 1925 and renamed Dalmacija , and the rest of the cruisers were withdrawn from service by the end of the 1920s and used for secondary duties or broken up for scrap . Medusa and Arcona were converted into anti @-@ aircraft ships in 1940 and were scuttled at the end of World War II . Dalmacija was captured twice during the war , first by the Italians , who renamed her Cattaro , and then by the Germans , who restored the original name of Niobe . She ran aground in December 1943 and was subsequently destroyed by British Motor Torpedo Boats . Amazone was the only member to survive the war intact , as a barracks ship , and she remained in service until 1954 , when she was broken up for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Gazelle class was the first modern light cruiser design of the Imperial Navy . The design for the Gazelle class followed several intermediate types , including the Bussard class of unprotected cruisers and the unique vessels Gefion and Hela . They were intended to fulfill the requirements for a fleet scout and an overseas cruiser . The design was somewhat smaller than contemporary light cruisers , but the ships were nevertheless sturdy and powerfully armed for the period . These characteristics evenly balanced the requirements for the two roles envisioned for the class . According to the historian Eric Osborne , " [ t ] he light cruisers of the Gazelle @-@ class established a trend for future ships of this general design ... [ they ] carried little or no armor , the chief asset being speed . " Indeed , all future light cruisers built by the Imperial Navy generally followed the same pattern , with few fundamental changes . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The ships of the Gazelle class were 104 @.@ 10 to 104 @.@ 40 m ( 341 ft 6 in to 342 ft 6 in ) long at the waterline and 105 meters ( 344 ft 6 in ) long overall . The first seven ships had a beam of 12 @.@ 20 m ( 40 ft 0 in ) and the last three were slightly wider , at 12 @.@ 40 m ( 40 ft 8 in ) . They had a draft of 4 @.@ 11 to 5 @.@ 38 m ( 13 ft 6 in to 17 ft 8 in ) forward and 5 @.@ 31 to 5 @.@ 69 m ( 17 ft 5 in to 18 ft 8 in ) aft . They were designed to displace 2 @,@ 643 to 2 @,@ 706 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 601 to 2 @,@ 663 long tons ) at a normal loading , and at full combat load their displacement rose to 2 @,@ 963 to 3 @,@ 180 t ( 2 @,@ 916 to 3 @,@ 130 long tons ; 3 @,@ 266 to 3 @,@ 505 short tons ) . The ships ' hulls were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames ; the outer hull wall consisted of wooden planks covered with a layer of Muntz metal to prevent fouling . The Muntz metal extended up to a meter above the waterline . The hull was divided into twelve watertight compartments and it had a double bottom that extended for 40 percent of the length of the keel . For the last three ships , their double bottom was lengthened to 46 percent of the hull . 
 All ten ships were crank and rolled severely . They were also wet in a head sea . After their modernizations , they tended to suffer from lee helm . Nevertheless , the ships turned tightly and were very maneuverable . In a hard turn , their speed fell up to 65 percent . They had a transverse metacentric height of .5 to .63 m ( 1 ft 8 in to 2 ft 1 in ) . The Gazelle class required a crew of 14 officers and 243 enlisted men , though for the last three ships , the number of enlisted men rose to 256 . They carried a number of boats , including one picket boat , one pinnace , two cutters , two yawls , and one dinghy . 
 = = = Machinery = = = 
 Their propulsion system consisted of two triple @-@ expansion engines manufactured by the dockyards that built the ships . Gazelle 's engines were designed to give 6 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 4 @,@ 500 kW ) , for a top speed of 19 @.@ 5 knots ( 36 @.@ 1 km / h ; 22 @.@ 4 mph ) , while the rest of the ships ' engines were rated at 8 @,@ 000 ihp ( 6 @,@ 000 kW ) for 21 @.@ 5 knots ( 39 @.@ 8 km / h ; 24 @.@ 7 mph ) . The engines were powered by eight coal @-@ fired water @-@ tube boilers of various manufacture , divided into two boiler rooms . The first three ships carried 500 tonnes ( 490 long tons ) of coal , which gave them a range of 3 @,@ 570 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 610 km ; 4 @,@ 110 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The next four vessels carried slightly more , at 560 t ( 550 long tons ) , which allowed them to cruise to the approximately same range , 3 @,@ 560 nmi ( 6 @,@ 590 km ; 4 @,@ 100 mi ) , at the higher speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . The last three ships carried 700 t ( 690 long tons ) of coal , which substantially increased their cruising radius , to 4 @,@ 400 nmi ( 8 @,@ 100 km ; 5 @,@ 100 mi ) at 12 knots . The ships were equipped with three electricity generators that provided a total of 110 kilowatts at 110 volts . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 The ships were armed with ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 40 guns in single mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , six were located amidships , three on either side , and two were placed side by side aft . The guns could engage targets out to 12 @,@ 200 m ( 40 @,@ 000 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 000 rounds of ammunition , for 100 shells per gun , though the allotment for the last three ships increased to 1 @,@ 500 rounds , or 150 per gun . They were also equipped with torpedo tubes . Gazelle had three 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) tubes with eight torpedoes ; one was submerged in the hull in the bow and two were mounted in deck launchers on the broadside . The rest of the class only had two 45 cm tubes with five torpedoes , and these were submerged in the ships ' hulls , on the broadside . 
 The ships were protected by an armored deck that was 20 to 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 to 0 @.@ 98 in ) thick , with 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick sloping armor on the side . The armor consisted of two layers of steel with a single layer of Krupp steel . The Gazelle @-@ class cruisers were also equipped with cork cofferdams to increase buoyancy . The conning tower had 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick sides , with a 20 mm thick roof . The guns were protected by 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick shields .

 The ten ships of the Gazelle class were built between 1897 and 1904 , at various German dockyards , including private firms and government shipyards . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The Gazelle @-@ class cruisers served in various capacities after their commissioning . Most of them served with the fleet reconnaissance force , though several served on foreign stations as well . Gazelle served abroad in 1902 – 1904 , Thetis in 1902 – 1906 , Niobe in 1906 – 1909 , and Arcona in 1907 – 1910 . Nymphe was also used as a training ship for naval cadets in addition to her fleet scout role , and Undine served as a gunnery training ship . 
 Due to their age , the Gazelles had been placed in reserve by 1914 , but after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , they were mobilized for active service . Most were initially used as coastal defense vessels in the Baltic , but Frauenlob and Ariadne remained in service with the fleet . They both saw action at the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914 ; Frauenlob engaged and badly damaged the British cruiser HMS Arethusa , while Ariadne was sunk by several battlecruisers . Frauenlob soldiered on in the fleet reconnaissance forces until the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916 , when she was torpedoed and sunk by HMS Southampton in a ferocious night battle , with the loss of almost her entire crew . In the Baltic , Undine was torpedoed and sunk by the British submarine HMS E19 on 7 November 1915 . 
 The seven surviving ships were withdrawn from front @-@ line service in 1916 and disarmed , with the exception of Medusa , which retained six of her guns , and Thetis , which was rearmed with nine 10 @.@ 5 cm U @-@ boat guns for use as a gunnery training ship . The remaining seven cruisers survived the war and went on to serve in the new Reichsmarine , except for Gazelle , which was broken up for scrap in 1920 . The ships remained in service throughout the 1920s , but were all withdrawn by the early 1930s . Niobe was sold to Yugoslavia in 1925 and renamed Dalmacija , while Nymphe and Thetis were scrapped in the early 1930s . Arcona , Medusa , and Amazone were used as barracks hulks for the rest of the 1930s . 
 After the outbreak of World War II , Medusa and Arcona were converted into floating anti @-@ aircraft batteries and defended German ports from 1940 to the end of the war , when they were scuttled by their crews on 3 May 1945 . Amazone meanwhile remained in service as a barracks ship through the end of the war . Dalmacija was captured by the Italians after the Invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , renamed Cattaro , and pressed into service with the Italian Navy . She was then captured by the Germans after the Italian surrender in September 1943 , and returned to her original name , Niobe . The ship ran aground in the Adriatic in December 1943 and was destroyed by a pair of British Motor Torpedo Boats . Niobe , Medusa , and Arcona were broken up for scrap in the late 1940s , but Amazone lingered on as a barracks ship until 1954 , when she too was sold for scrapping . 
 = Ricardo Arias Calderón = 
 Ricardo Arias Calderón ( born 4 May 1933 ) is a Panamanian politician who served as First Vice President from 1989 to 1992 . A Roman Catholic who studied at Yale and the Sorbonne , Arias returned to Panama in the 1960s to work for political reform . He went on to become the president of the Christian Democratic Party of Panama and a leading opponent of the military government of Manuel Noriega . In 1984 , he ran as a candidate for Second Vice President on the ticket of three @-@ time former president Arnulfo Arias , but they were defeated by pro @-@ Noriega candidate Nicolás Ardito Barletta . 
 Following an annulled 1989 election and the US invasion of Panama later in the same year , Arias Calderón was sworn in as First Vice President of Panama under President Guillermo Endara . After growing tensions in the ruling coalition , Arias resigned his position on December 17 , 1992 , stating that the government had not done enough to help Panama 's people . He continued to be an active voice in Panamanian politics following his resignation , supporting the Panama Canal expansion project and opposing the extradition of Noriega . 
 = = Background = = 
 Arias ' maternal family was from Nicaragua , having left during political upheaval there before Arias ' birth . One of Arias ' great uncles ran for president in Panama , while another was a supporter of the Nicaraguan revolutionary Sandino , a family history that gave Arias an early interest in politics . His father , an engineer , died when Arias was two years old , and he was raised primarily by his mother , aunt , and grandmother . His mother later remarried to a Panamanian ambassador to the United States . 
 Arias studied at Culver Military Academy in Indiana in the US . He later majored in English literature at Yale University and philosophy at Paris @-@ Sorbonne University . A Roman Catholic , Arias was heavily influenced by Catholic French philosopher and ethicist Jacques <unk> . Aesthetic , publicly stiff , and accused of aloofness , Arias would later be nicknamed " Arias Cardinal Calderón " during his political career . 
 = = Early political career = = 
 Arias returned to Panama in the early 1960s to work for political reform , soon joining the small Christian Democratic Party of Panama . In 1972 , he left Panama for some time with his family , becoming a dean and later vice president at Florida International University in Miami , Florida in the US . In 1980 , however , he declined an offer to become provost , and instead returned to Panamanian politics . 
 During the rule of military leader Manuel Noriega , Arias was an opposition leader as the president of the Christian Democratic Party of Panama , a member party of the Civic Democratic Opposition Alliance ( ADOC ) . He ran on the ticket of three @-@ time former president Arnulfo Arias ( no relation ) in the 1984 election as the National Alliance of Opposition 's candidate for Second Vice President . Arnulfo Arias was narrowly defeated by Noriega ally Nicolás Ardito Barletta Vallarino , and the opposition stated that the election had been fraudulent . 
 In February 1988 , plainclothes police officers forced Arias Calderón and his wife onto a plane to Costa Rica at gunpoint , and the couple spent a month in exile in Miami . Arias returned to Panama in March , calling openly for Noriega 's ouster on arrival at the Omar Torrijos International Airport . In Panama 's May 1989 elections , Arias stood as a candidate for First Vice President with the ADOC , with Guillermo Endara as the presidential candidate and Guillermo Ford as the candidate for Second Vice President . However , Noriega 's government annulled the election before voting was complete . Days after the completion of voting , Endara , Arias , and Ford were attacked on camera by Noriega supporters while security forces observed and refused to intervene . In October of that year , Arias was briefly arrested for urging citizens not to pay taxes to his government . 
 = = Vice presidency = = 
 Following Noriega 's fall in the December 1989 US invasion of Panama , Arias was certified as vice president of Panama under President Endara and inaugurated on a US military base . 
 Arias was put in charge of reforming the Panamanian police forces , putting them under civilian control . He controversially employed former members of Noriega 's Panamanian Defense Forces , stating that he trusted them with his own security and that it was " time to look to the future " . His defense of former PDF soldiers split supporters of the coalition government , and in May 1990 , sparked rumors that he and the CDP were attempting a coup while Endara was out of the country . The presidential offices were occupied by Endara loyalists with <unk> , who accidentally shot and killed one of Endara 's staff members . 
 In early 1991 , the ADOC coalition began to unravel as Endara , Arias , and Ford publicly criticized one another . On April 8 , accusing Arias ' Christian Democrats of not rallying to his support during an impeachment vote , Endara dismissed Arias from the cabinet . 
 Arias resigned from the vice presidency on December 17 , 1992 , stating at a news conference that Endara 's government " does not listen to the people , nor does it have the courage to make changes " . Endara responded that Arias ' resignation was " demagoguery " and " merely starting his 1994 political campaign ahead of time " .
