 = Jean Ambroise Baston de Lariboisière = 
 Jean Ambroise Baston de Lariboisière , also Count de Lariboisière , was a general of artillery of the First French Empire . He fought in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars and died of fatigue at Königsberg in East Prussia on 21 December 1812 , during the Grand Army 's retreat from Moscow . 
 A superb organizer and tactician , Baston de Lariboisière rose rapidly through the artillery ranks and reliably directed the artillery park for the initial engagements of the War of the First Coalition in 1793 – 1794 . He also directed the investment and , if necessary , the sieges of Mainz , Ulm , and Danzig , among others . In addition , he was a reliable commander of infantry , supporting Laurent Saint @-@ Cyr 's corps in northern Italy in the 1799 campaign . 
 Lariboisière 's direction of artillery fire at the Battle of Austerlitz resulted in the destruction of the ice covering the lake over which Russian army forces retreated . His placement of artillery at the Battle of Borodino gave the French a tactical advantage in fire on the Russian lines . Lariboisière 's artillery also provided the rear guard coverage of the French withdrawal from <unk> . One of his sons survived the wars and the family founded the Lariboisière Hospital in Paris . 
 = = Family and education = = 
 He was born on 18 August 1759 , in Fougères . His father , Ambroise Baston de Lariboisière , was lieutenant general of civil and criminal justice and the <unk> of Fougères . His mother was Jeanne <unk> . Baston de Lariboisière was designated early for a military career . 
 He was a brilliant student at the military academy and in 1781 received a commission as a lieutenant and entered the same regiment as Napoleon Bonaparte . Although Lariboisière was a few years older than Bonaparte , they developed a rapport that continued until Lariboisière 's death in 1812 . 
 = = Military career = = 
 Baston de Lariboisière was cited as a distinguished officer the outset of the French Revolution , for which he showed only moderate support . He was promoted to captain in 1791 and assigned to Adam Philippe , Comte de Custine 's command . He took part in the invasion of <unk> against the Prussians . After the surrender of the French army , he was held as a prisoner of war . 
 In the following years , he participated in the campaigns of 1796 , as adjutant colonel , colonel , and brigadier general , and directed the artillery parks of the Army of England , the Army of Helvetia , the Army of the Rhine . When Jean Baptiste Jourdan organized the Army of the Danube , Lariboisière received command of the artillery park . 
 At the First Battle of Zurich , Lariboisière 's artillery defended the Zurich heights , which gave Andre Massena 's army enough time to evacuate the city and take position on the opposite side of the Limmat river . Afterward , Lariboisière was sent to northern Italy where he commanded the advance guard division ; Jean Victor Moreau 's right wing , with Lariboisière 's infantry and artillery , crossed the Ticino river at Pavia , marched up the left bank of the Po River and took position beneath Alessandria ; there , he protected Moreau 's flank from Russian skirmishers sufficiently for Moreau to establish a large train of artillery in Turin and to strengthen the French positions between the Po and the Tanaro river . 
 At Battle of Novi , his division was part of Laurent Saint @-@ Cyr 's right wing . At the battle itself , his troops were the only ones properly positioned ; the rest of the French army was otherwise out of place and unready for battle . He and Saint @-@ Cyr held the center of the French line , beating off two Russian assaults . After the French defeat at Novi , he went with Saint @-@ Cyr to Savona , where he participated in operations around Genoa . Eventually , he rejoined Moreau to campaign in southwestern Germany , culminating in the Battle of Hohenlinden . 
 = = = Napoleonic Wars = = = 
 Baston de Lariboisière commanded the artillery of the French IV Corps for the 1805 campaign of the War of the Third Coalition . He directed the investment of Ulm prior to its capitulation , and contributed to the success of Austerlitz . There he commanded the artillery attached to Soult corps . By firing on the ice of the lakes over which the Russian columns were retreating , Baston de Lariboisière 's artillery fire converted a Russian retreat into a full @-@ scale rout : in the bombardment , French artillery pounded the soldiers and broke the ice . The men drowned in the cold ponds , dozens of Russian artillery pieces going down along with them . 
 In the Battle of Jena @-@ Auerstadt , Baston de Lariboisière successfully repelled several infantry charges with artillery fire . Subsequently , Napoleon raised him to major general , and appointed him to command the artillery of the Imperial Guard at Battle of Eylau , in February 1807 . Baston de Lariboisière remained throughout the day @-@ long battle with a battery of 40 guns at the French center . After the campaigns of 1806 , Baston de Lariboisière briefly served as governor of Hanover . He later replaced General Nicolas @-@ Marie <unk> des <unk> prior to the engagements in northeastern Prussia in 1807 . At the Battle of Danzig , although wounded by a sniper 's bullet , he continued to direct the siege of the city . He directed the Imperial guard artillery for the battles of Heilsberg and Friedland ; after Friedland , Baston de Lariboisière organized the security of the raft on the Niemen river , where Napoleon and Alexander II of Russia conferred on the terms of the Peace of Tilsit . 
 In February 1808 , General Lariboisière took command of the artillery of the Army of Spain . Recalled to the Grand Army in 1809 , Napoleon gave the command of the artillery at the Battle of Wagram . In 1811 Napoleon raised him to the post of first inspector general of ordnance — weaponry and ammunition . 
 = = Russian campaign , 1812 = = 
 In planning the Russian campaign , 1812 , Lariboisière immediately foresaw difficulties in transporting the requisite amount of artillery and ammunition the vast distance from the Nieman river into Russia . The army left Prussia with over 1100 artillery pieces of various kinds and sizes . Despite heavy rain , the French arrived in Vilnius ; despite the mud , the artillery was established prior to the battle and contributed with successful targeted fire . 
 On the evening before the Battle of Borodino , Baston de Lariboisière scouted the Russian positions to determine the means of bombarding the redoubts that the Russians had established on their left . During the night , he strategically placed the French artillery park ; at daybreak , the artillery bombarded the Russian positions , firing over 70 @,@ 000 rounds . One of Lariboisière 's sons ( Ferdinand ) , was fatally wounded in a charge on the Russian lines at Borodino . Grief @-@ stricken and exhausted with fatigue , the general fell sick in Vilnius and died in Königsberg on 21 December 1812 .

 The General 's heart is hosted in a private chapel near his castle of <unk> at <unk> @-@ du @-@ <unk> , in Brittany . 
 Honoré @-@ Charles Baston de Lariboisière , another of his sons , also served in the artillery . He survived not only the Battle of Borodino in which his brother ( Ferdinand ) was killed , but also the retreat from Moscow and the subsequent campaigns in Prussia and Saxony . He served in the Chamber of Deputies and was raised to the peerage of France . He founded the Hôpital Lariboisière . 
 = Banksia marginata = 
 Banksia marginata , commonly known as the Silver Banksia , is a species of tree or woody shrub in the plant genus Banksia found throughout much of southeastern Australia . It ranges from the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia , to north of Armidale , New South Wales , and across Tasmania and the islands of Bass Strait . It grows in various habitats , including Eucalyptus forest , scrub , heathland and moorland . Banksia marginata varies widely in habit , ranging from a small shrub , 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) high , to a large tree , 12 m ( 40 ft ) tall . The narrow leaves are linear and the yellow inflorescences ( flower spikes ) occur from late summer to early winter . The flower spikes fade to brown and then grey and develop woody follicles bearing the winged seeds . Originally described by Antonio José Cavanilles in 1800 , further collections of B. marginata were described as several separate species by Robert Brown in 1810 . However , all were reclassified as a single species by George Bentham in 1870 . No distinct subspecies have been recognised by Banksia expert Alex George , who nonetheless concedes that further work is needed . 
 Many species of bird , in particular honeyeaters , forage at the flower spikes , as do native and European honeybees . The response to bushfire varies . Some populations are serotinous : they are killed by fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in the plant canopy and are released . Others regenerate from underground lignotubers or suckers from lateral roots . Although it has been used for timber , Banksia marginata is most commonly seen as a garden plant , with dwarf forms being commercially propagated and sold . 
 = = Description = = 
 Banksia marginata is a highly variable species , usually ranging from a small shrub around a metre ( 3 ft ) tall to a 12 @-@ metre @-@ high ( 39 ft ) tree . Unusually large trees of 15 to possibly 30 m ( 50 – 100 ft ) have been reported near Beeac in Victoria 's Western District as well as several locations in Tasmania , while compact shrubs limited to 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) high have been recorded on coastal heathland in Tasmania ( such as at Rocky Cape National Park ) . Shrubs reach only 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) high in Gibraltar Range National Park . The bark is pale grey and initially smooth before becoming finely tessellated with age . The new branchlets are hairy at first but lose their hairs as they mature , the new growth a pale or pinkish brown . The leaves are alternately arranged on the stems on 2 – 5 mm long petioles , and characteristically toothed in juvenile or younger leaves ( 3 – 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) long ) . The narrow adult leaves are dull green in colour and generally linear , oblong or wedge @-@ shaped ( cuneate ) and measure 1 @.@ 5 – 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) long and 0 @.@ 3 – 1 @.@ 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 5 in ) wide . The margins become entire with age , and the tip is most commonly truncate or emarginate , but can be acute or mucronate . The cellular makeup of the leaves shows evidence of <unk> , and the leaves themselves are somewhat stiff . Leaves also have sunken <unk> . The leaf undersurface is white with a prominent midrib covered in brownish hairs . 
 The complex flower spikes , known as inflorescences , appear generally from late summer to early winter ( February to June ) in New South Wales and Victoria , although flowering occurs in late autumn and winter in the Gibraltar Range . Cylindrical in shape , they are composed of a central woody spike or axis , perpendicularly from which a large number of compact floral units arise , which measure 5 – 10 cm ( 2 – 4 in ) tall and 4 – 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) wide . Pale yellow in colour , they are composed of up to 1000 individual flowers ( 784 recorded in the Gibraltar Range ) and arise from nodes on branchlets that are at least three years old . Sometimes two may grow from successive nodes in the same flowering season . They can have a grey or golden tinge in late bud . As with most banksias , anthesis is acropetal ; the opening of the individual buds proceeds up the flower spike from the base to the top . Over time the flower spikes fade to brown and then grey , and the old flowers generally persist on the cone . The woody follicles grow in the six months after flowering , with up to 150 developing on a single flower spike . In many populations , only a few follicles develop . Small and elliptic , they measure 0 @.@ 7 – 1 @.@ 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 7 in ) long , 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 2 in ) high , and 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 2 in ) wide . In coastal and floodplain populations , these usually open spontaneously and release seed , while they generally remain sealed until burnt by fire in plants from heathland and montane habitats . Each follicle contains one or two fertile seeds , between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to the seeds . Measuring 0 @.@ 9 – 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 6 in ) in length , the seed is egg- to wedge @-@ shaped ( obovate to cuneate ) and composed of a dark brown 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 4 in ) wide membranous " wing " and <unk> or sickle @-@ shaped ( cuneate – falcate ) seed proper which measures 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 3 in ) long by 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 2 in ) wide . The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges , and often glistens . The resulting seedling first grows two obovate cotyledon leaves , which may remain for several months as several more leaves appear . The cotyledons of Banksia marginata , B. paludosa and B. integrifolia are very similar in appearance . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 Banksia marginata is commonly called the silver banksia , because the white undersides of its leaves contrast with the otherwise green foliage and give the plant a " silvery " look . Alternate common names include honeysuckle and dwarf honeysuckle . The aboriginal name in the Jardwadjali language of western Victoria was <unk> , while the Kaurna name from the Adelaide Plains was <unk> and the local name in the Macquarie Harbour region in Tasmania was <unk> . 
 A widely distributed and diverse plant , B. marginata was described independently and given many different names by early explorers . It was first collected by Luis Née in 1793 , from somewhere between Sydney and Parramatta . In 1800 , the Spanish botanist Antonio José Cavanilles gave the species the binomial name it still bears today . The species name is the Latin adjective marginatus ( " bordered " ) and refers to appearance of the lower surface of the recurved margins of the leaves when viewed from underneath . Cavanilles also described another specimen collected by Née in the same locality as a different species , Banksia <unk> Cav . A smaller shrub with dentate leaves , this turned out to be an immature plant of the same species with juvenile leaves . 
 Robert Brown described 31 species of Banksia in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen , including six taxa ( B. marginata α and β plus four further species ) now attributable to B. marginata . He split the genus into two subgenera , placing these species in subgenus Banksia verae , the " True Banksias " . He described Banksia australis R.Br. , giving the location of the collection as Port Phillip Bay in Victoria in 1802 ( having crossed out Van Diemen 's Land 1804 ) . Brown 's other collections which were reduced to synonymy with B. marginata were Banksia <unk> R.Br. , a prostrate shrub from Margate Rivulet in southeastern Tasmania , Banksia insularis R.Br. , from Flinders and King Island , and Banksia patula R.Br. , a shrub from the vicinity of Port Lincoln , South Australia . The French naturalist Aimé Bonpland in 1816 called it Banksia marcescens <unk> . , deemed an illegitimate name , as by that time the name Banksia marginata already had been published . Still more synonyms are Banksia ferrea <unk> ex <unk> and Banksia <unk> <unk> . 
 By the time Carl Meissner published his 1856 arrangement of the genus , there were 58 described Banksia species . Meissner divided Brown 's Banksia verae , which had been renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847 , into four series based on leaf properties . He listed six species and a further four varieties all now sunk into B. marginata in series Salicinae . 
 In 1870 , George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis . In Bentham 's arrangement , the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46 . Bentham observed that the characteristics Brown used to define B. australis , B. <unk> , B. patula , and B. insularis were unable to distinguish separate forms as more specimens came to light , and hence declared them synonyms of B. marginata . Meissner 's four series were replaced by four sections based on leaf , style and pollen @-@ presenter characters . B. marginata was placed in section Eubanksia along with B. integrifolia and B. dentata . 
 = = = Placement within Banksia = = = 
 The current taxonomic arrangement of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George 's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series . In this arrangement , B. marginata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia , because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia 's characteristic flower spikes , section Banksia because of its straight styles , and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical . In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994 , Kevin Thiele placed it as the most basal member of a newly described subseries Integrifoliae , within the series Salicinae . However , this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George . George did concede that major work is needed on Banksia marginata , which shows such a high degree of variability over its range . 
 B. marginata 's placement within Banksia may be summarised as follows :

 B. dentata – B. aquilonia – B. integrifolia – B. plagiocarpa – B. oblongifolia – B. robur – B. conferta – B. paludosa – B. marginata – B. canei – B. saxicola 
 Since 1998 , American botanist Austin Mast and co @-@ authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae , which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra . Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George 's taxonomic arrangement . Banksia marginata resolves as the closest relative , or " sister " , to B. saxicola , the two taxa part of a larger group containing B. paludosa and the three subspecies of B. integrifolia . Early in 2007 , Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it , and published B. subg . Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons ; thus B. subg . Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons . They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete ; in the meantime , if Mast and Thiele 's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement , then B. marginata is placed in B. subg . Spathulatae . 
 = = = Hybrids with other species = = = 
 Hybridisation with Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata at the site of an old abandoned railway between Newnes and Clarence in the Blue Mountains has been recorded ; a single B. marginata plant was surrounded by plants with intermediate features but more strongly resembling B. conferta subsp. penicillata . B. marginata can also interbreed with B. paludosa where they are found together . A hybrid with B. saxicola was recorded from Mount William during the Banksia Atlas project . 
 A purported hybrid with B. integrifolia , thought to be from Cape Paterson on Victoria 's south coast , was first described by Alf Salkin and is commercially available in small quantities . It forms an attractive hardy low @-@ growing plant to 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . Salkin observed an intermediate form which occurred in coastal areas where Banksia marginata and B. integrifolia are found together . Calling it the Wilsons Promontory <unk> , he noted that it colonised sand dunes , had leaves similar to but narrower than integrifolia , and had persisting flowers on old spikes but not as persistent as marginata . He had collected this form from <unk> in New South Wales as well as Cape Paterson , and had received reports of similar plants at Marlo and <unk> Rivers . Stands of plants intermediate between B. integrifolia and B. marginata have been recorded near Mallacoota in East Gippsland . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Banksia marginata is found from <unk> and Gibraltar Range National Park in northern New South Wales , southwards into Victoria and South Australia , as well as across Tasmania . It is found on the major islands of Bass Strait , including King , Flinders and Cape Barren Islands . There is one report of a collection from the Springbrook Mountains southwest of Southport in southeastern Queensland . It is extremely rare in southwestern New South Wales . In Victoria , it is predominantly coastal or near @-@ coastal east of Traralgon , but in New South Wales it is absent from coastal areas in the Sydney region . Banksia marginata often grew as a large tree on the basalt plains west of Melbourne , but has almost disappeared . In the vicinity of Adelaide , it was common in the western suburbs on old sand dunes behind the beach <unk> . It remains common in the Adelaide foothills . The annual rainfall over its distribution ranges from 400 to 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 16 to 39 in ) . 
 In the Gibraltar Range National Park , it is a dominant shrub of open heathland and a non @-@ dominant shrub of closed heath , mostly found in swampy heath associated with sedges . Plants here have some degree of self @-@ compatibility . In the Sydney region , it grows in association with heath banksia ( Banksia ericifolia ) , old man banksia ( B. serrata ) , mountain devil ( Lambertia formosa ) , lance @-@ leaved geebung ( Persoonia lanceolata ) and dwarf apple ( Angophora hispida ) in heathland , and with silvertop ash ( Eucalyptus sieberi ) , Blue Mountains ash ( E. oreades ) , Sydney peppermint ( E. piperita ) , scribbly gum ( E. haemastoma ) , Blue Mountains mallee ash ( E. stricta ) , brittle gum ( E. <unk> ) , snow gum ( E. pauciflora ) and red bloodwood ( Corymbia gummifera ) in forested areas . 
 It is widespread as an understory species in medium rainfall eucalypt forests across Victoria , occurring in association with manna gum ( Eucalyptus viminalis ) , narrow @-@ leaf peppermint ( E. radiata ) , messmate ( E. obliqua ) , swamp gum ( E. ovata ) and brown stringybark ( E. baxteri ) . It is a common shrub , sometimes small tree , in <unk> and shrubby forests as well as coastal scrub and heath in part of its range . In South Gippsland , it is generally a shrub which regenerates from a lignotuber or suckers after bushfire and sets few seed . It has been recorded as a low spreading shrub in <unk> National Park in East Gippsland . In the Wombat State Forest west of Melbourne , it grows as a 1 to 2 m ( 3 @.@ 3 to 6 @.@ 6 ft ) high shrub on less fertile soils , and as a large tree to 8 m ( 26 ft ) on more fertile soils . Few trees remain , having been cleared for agriculture or for fuel . Similarly , further west in the <unk> region , it is either a tree or suckering shrub . 
 In Tasmania , Banksia marginata occupies a wide range of habitats , in mixed forest ( where it grows as a small tree ) , button grass moorlands , flood plains of the Loddon , Franklin and Huon Rivers , as well as coastal regions . In parts of the west and southwest of Tasmania , the species is dominant within the threatened native vegetation community known as Banksia marginata wet scrub . Interestingly , there is no <unk> record for the species , so it is unclear whether it is a recent introduction from the mainland or has only recently evolved , although its presence on both the mainland and Tasmania suggests it has been present since the Pleistocene . It grows in coastal habitats that would be occupied by Banksia integrifolia on the mainland . 
 Banksia marginata grows on a variety of soil types , from clay loams , shale and peaty loams to sandy or rocky soils composed of quartzite , sandstone , limestone or granite , although <unk> soils predominate . It is restricted to sandy soils in the Adelaide region . The soil types are of a wide range of pH , from highly acidic soils in the Grampians to alkaline soils in South Australia . Plants have been recorded at altitudes ranging from sea level to as high as 1 @,@ 200 m ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) AHD at Mount Field National Park .

 Numerous species of birds have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers ; these include rainbow lorikeet ( Trichoglossus <unk> ) , musk lorikeet ( <unk> <unk> ) , purple @-@ crowned lorikeet ( G. <unk> ) , double @-@ eyed fig @-@ parrot ( <unk> <unk> ) , red wattlebird ( Anthochaera carunculata ) , little wattlebird ( A. chrysoptera ) , yellow wattlebird ( A. <unk> ) , spiny @-@ cheeked honeyeater ( <unk> <unk> ) , yellow @-@ faced honeyeater ( Lichenostomus chrysops ) , singing honeyeater ( Lichenostomus virescens ) , white @-@ plumed honeyeater ( L. penicillatus ) , black @-@ chinned honeyeater ( Melithreptus gularis ) , brown @-@ headed honeyeater ( M. brevirostris ) , white @-@ naped honeyeater ( M. lunatus ) , crescent honeyeater ( Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera ) , New Holland honeyeater ( P. novaehollandiae ) , tawny @-@ crowned honeyeater ( Gliciphila melanops ) , eastern spinebill ( Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris ) , noisy miner ( Manorina melanocephala ) , silvereye ( Zosterops lateralis ) and thornbills ( Acanthiza species ) . In addition , the yellow @-@ tailed black cockatoo ( Calyptorhynchus funereus ) feeds on the seed . 
 The agile antechinus ( Antechinus agilis ) , bush rat ( Rattus fuscipes ) , <unk> glider ( Acrobates pygmaeus ) , and sugar glider ( Petaurus breviceps ) have been recorded visiting flower spikes . Both pollen and nectar are consumed by the southwestern pygmy possum ( <unk> <unk> ) . Ants , bees ( both native and European honeybees ) , blowflies and brown butterflies have been recorded as visitors to flower spikes . The wasp <unk> <unk> of the subfamily <unk> within the family <unk> causes stem galls on B. marginata in southeastern South Australia . The galls are either round to a diameter of 3 @.@ 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 3 in ) , or cigar @-@ shaped to 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) . Their effect on the plant is unclear . B. marginata is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the <unk> beetle <unk> imperialis . Much more pathological is the banksia <unk> beetle ( <unk> australis ) which bores holes in the base of banksia plants which then weaken and fall or blow over with wind and die . Several species of fungus have been recorded growing on the foliage , including <unk> <unk> , <unk> elegans , Asterina systema @-@ solare , <unk> banksiae , a species of <unk> , <unk> banksiae , <unk> banksiae , <unk> banksiae , a <unk> species , <unk> australiensis , <unk> <unk> , and a species of <unk> . 
 All banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots in response to the nutrient @-@ poor conditions of Australian soils ( particularly lacking in phosphorus ) . The root system of the suckering forms of Banksia marginata in Victoria and South Australia have a characteristic pattern with a deep tap root , and an extensive system of thick lateral roots 7 @.@ 5 – 15 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) below the surface . During the winter months , segments around 30 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 ft ) in length develop vegetative buds capable of forming suckers . Clusters of fine proteoid roots up to 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) long arise from these lateral roots . 
 The response of Banksia marginata to fire is variable . In the Gibraltar Range and Sydney regions , plants are killed by fire and regenerate from seed . They are serotinous , storing their seed in old cones , forming a seedbank in their canopy which is released after bushfire . A field study found that seeds were dispersed short distances ( generally 8 m [ 26 ft ] or less ) , with those closest to the parent plant faring the best . In Little Desert National Park in northwestern Victoria and also eastern south Australia , it grows as a low shrub which suckers ( shoots growing from lateral roots ) after fire . Plants do not appear to live longer than 25 years ; after this time the ageing plants begin to die and are succeeded by younger plants arising from suckers around the parent . A field study in Gippsland found counting the nodes of Banksia marginata plants to be accurate in indicating age within a year up to 21 years since the last fire . There is <unk> evidence of plants reaching 150 years old in this region . Plant species from communities dependent on fire are thought to self @-@ select to be more flammable ; Banksia marginata tested from a dry sclerophyll community in southeastern Tasmania was shown to burn readily , and fire would spread easily through it . 
 Tasmanian forms have been shown to be frost tolerant at any time of year , which might explain some of their success in spreading and growing in different habitats around the island . This attribute might have allowed them to survive cold periods in Tasmania in the Pleistocene . 
 A trial in Western Australia showed Banksia marginata to be mildly sensitive to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback . At Brisbane Ranges National Park west of Melbourne , which was invaded by Phytophthora cinnamomi in the 1970s , Banksia marginata ( along with such species as Grevillea <unk> ) was part of a secondary regrowth of understory species after more resistant shrubs such as grasses and sedges had grown back .

 The red @-@ hued heartwood is coarse @-@ grained and soft . It is sometimes used for turning , but requires careful drying before use to avoid warping . A sample was prepared in Victoria in 1885 as part of a collection of local timber species under the direction of Government botanist Ferdinand von Mueller . The collection was displayed in various exhibitions , including the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889 , and is housed at the Melbourne Museum . 
 = = = Cultivation = = = 
 Banksia marginata was first introduced into cultivation in England in 1802 ( and was also listed as B. australis , B. insularis and B. marcescens ) ; it was grown at Kew , Cambridge Botanic Gardens , Woburn Abbey and private gardens in Chelsea , Hackney and <unk> House . One specimen grown in a glasshouse at Kew was described as a tree 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) high with a trunk girth of two feet ( 60 cm ) at 40 years of age . 
 B. marginata is generally fairly easy to grow in a well @-@ drained sunny or part @-@ shaded position in the garden . It can be leggy in <unk> positions , or a more compact bushy shrub in full sun . Some varieties from drier areas seem to do poorly in areas of summer humidity . The flowers are not prominent unless they are numerous . Established plants can withstand drought , coastal exposure and temperatures as low as − 10 ° C ( 14 ° F ) . Propagation of plants can be by seed or cuttings ; the latter is essential if trying to replicate plants of particular habit ( such as dwarf specimens ) . Some Banksia marginata seed of subalpine provenance require stratification , namely keeping at 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) for 60 days before germination takes place over 6 to 25 days . Salkin proposed this was necessary so that seed released in a summer or autumn bushfire would lie dormant over the winter months before germinating in the spring . Banksia saxicola and Banksia canei seed also share this trait . 
 Some dwarf forms have been commercially available in Australian nurseries , although some selections do not maintain their dwarf status in cultivation . Banksia ' Mini Marg ' is a small form selected from the northeastern coast of Tasmania which reaches 30 cm ( 12 in ) high and 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) wide . ' Mallacoota Dwarf ' was selected from a natural population at Mallacoota , Victoria . Alf Salkin reported a form from Kanangra Walls with a peach @-@ tinged limb as having horticultural potential , as well as a prostrate form from Cape <unk> in Victoria . Banksia marginata , and the dwarf cultivar ' Mini Marg ' , have also been used in bonsai .

 = = Synopsis = = 
 The documentary tells its story by focusing on the careers of six women — The Fabulous Moolah , Mae Young , Gladys " Kill ' Em " Gillem , Ida Mae Martinez , Ella Waldek and Penny Banner . It begins by describing the beginning of wrestling in the 1930s . By the 1940s , American men had to leave the country to fight in World War II , leaving females to take over the sport . At first , women 's wrestling was seen as a side @-@ show , and it was banned in several states . The film mostly focuses on these years — the 1940s — along with the 1950s and 1960s , better known as the " heyday of women 's wrestling " , when the sport became more accepted and popular . The six women are interviewed and tell their stories of why they entered wrestling . They also share tales of being exploited financially , unruly fans , and being physically abused . The film splices in archival footage of their matches , television clips , and footage from a 1951 movie entitled Racket Girls in between interviews . The film also covers their post @-@ wrestling occupations : lion @-@ tamer , detective , nurse , and <unk> . The film ends with footage from the Gulf Coast Wrestlers Reunion , where they meet to swap stories .

 Although Leitman was not a fan of professional wrestling , she was the first to develop the idea of a documentary about the beginnings of female wrestling . The objective of the film was to give back to the female professional wrestlers of the 1940s – 1960s . The stars hoped the film would help " set the record straight " about the early days of women 's wrestling , when it was taboo for girls to join the business . 
 Penny Banner helped put the film together , as she had connections in both the Ladies International Wrestling Association and the Cauliflower Alley Club , which helped the director locate older stars to use in the filming . 
 Kelly Hogan , an old friend of Leitman 's , offered to provide music for the film and soundtrack , and recorded songs with the combo , The Corn Sisters , Carolyn Mark and Neko Case . While recording , Case discovered that Ella Waldek was her great @-@ aunt , which was previously unknown to her . After providing music for the film , they began promoting it at all of their shows . 
 Leitman also produced the film with the productions companies 100 @-@ to @-@ One Films and Ruthless Films .

 The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution gave the film a positive review , citing at as " a dynamite documentary " and rating it a B + . Similarly , <unk> Bible of IGN called the film a " fascinating look " and a " valentine to wrestling and to the women who introduced the sport across America " . Liz Braun of the Toronto Sun called the film " a glimpse of the wild and woolly pre @-@ feminist world these capable women inhabited " and invites readers to " have a look . " The Los Angeles Times ' Kenneth Turan commented that the " uneasy , unnerving air of the carny hangs over this film , and it gives off a pungent whiff of how rough , rowdy and raucous , how inescapably down and dirty , these women 's world could be . " 
 Other reviews were mixed , with the film scoring a 62 % at Rotten Tomatoes and an average rating of 6 @.@ 4 / 10 from critics . Roger Ebert praised Leitman for doing " an extraordinary job of assembling the survivors from the early days of a disreputable sport " and rated the film with two and a half stars out of four . 
 Stephen Holden of The New York Times called the movie " more of a scrapbook than a coherent history " . The San Francisco Chronicle 's Peter Hartlaub stated that the film " doesn 't succeed in its attempt to make a feminist statement , with too many of the wrestlers sounding like male athletes who talk in excruciating detail about high school football seasons that everyone else forgot . " Echoing that statement , Russell Scott Smith of the New York Post stated , " Unfortunately , the filmmakers let the ladies prattle on too long about issues that would only matter to the most rabid wrestling aficionados .

 = 6th Airborne Division advance to the River Seine = 
 The 6th Airborne Division advance to the River Seine occurred in August 1944 , in the later stages of the Battle of Normandy , following the German Army 's defeat in the Falaise Pocket , during the Second World War . 
 The British 6th Airborne Division , under the command of Major @-@ General Richard Nelson Gale , was one of the first Allied units to arrive in Normandy on D @-@ Day , 6 June 1944 , and successfully secured the left flank of the invasion zone . Resisting efforts to dislodge them by the combined efforts of two infantry and one panzer division , a month later they were ordered to prepare to advance . Their objective was the mouth of the River Seine , 45 miles ( 72 km ) away . To assist them in carrying out their mission , the division was reinforced by the 1st and 4th Special Service Brigades , the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade and the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade , as well as increased artillery support . To reach the Seine , the division had to cross three rivers that had been flooded by the Germans , and had only two roads available to them . 
 The 6th Airborne Division began their advance on 17 August , after the German Army had started to withdraw . Fighting several small battles , by the end of the month they reached their objective at the River Seine . Here the division halted until early in September , when they returned to England to prepare for further airborne operations later in the war . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 6 June 1944 , the 6th Airborne Division landed in Normandy . Their mission was to secure the left flank of the invasion zone , by occupying and dominating the high ground between the River Orne and the River Dives . Despite the parachute troops being widely scattered , they managed to complete all of their objectives . After six days of counter @-@ attacks by German armour and infantry , the division 's position was secure by the end of the Battle of Breville on 12 June . Thereafter , they suffered only artillery bombardments . 
 Almost two months later on 7 August , the division was warned to prepare to advance . Their objective would be the mouth of the River Seine . To reinforce the lightly armed and equipped airborne division , the British 1st and 4th Special Service Brigades , together with the 1st Belgian and the Netherlands Infantry Brigades were placed under their command . Additional artillery support was provided by two field artillery regiments , a medium artillery battery , and a heavy anti @-@ aircraft artillery regiment used in a field artillery role . 
 In the operation the 6th Airborne Division together with the 7th Armoured Division , the 49th ( West Riding ) Infantry Division and the 51st ( Highland ) Infantry Division , formed the I Corps , attached to the First Canadian Army . When issuing his orders , Lieutenant General John Crocker , the Corps commander , aware that the 6th Airborne had almost no artillery , vehicles or engineer equipment , did not expect them to advance quickly . To reach the River Seine the division would have to cross three main rivers , along only two main lines of advance . One route was in the north , running along the French coast , while the other route was further inland between Troarn and Pont Audemer . 
 By this stage of Operation Overlord , German forces were of an unknown quantity and quality , but the division would be confronted by elements of Germany 's 711th Infantry Division , a part of the 15th Army . The 711th was composed of the <unk> and the 744th Grenadier Infantry Regiments , together with artillery and other supporting arms . Even before the invasion the German division had not been considered a front line formation , but rather a static division on anti @-@ invasion duties , and many of its units had not been at full strength . Furthermore , many of its troops were older than was normal in a first line division , or were conscripted foreigners from Poland and Russia . Being a static division , it was hampered further by having almost no transport of its own , and what was available was mostly horse drawn . 
 = = Breakout = = 
 The three infantry formations of the British I Corps were deployed with the 6th Airborne Division on the left , nearest the coast . In the centre was the 49th Division and on the right the 51st Division . The corps advance began on 15 August when the 49th Division captured Vimont , followed on the next day by the capture of Saint @-@ Pierre @-@ sur @-@ Dives by the 51st Division . On 17 August , the 6th Airborne Division advanced . The 6th Airlanding Brigade , with the Belgian and Netherlands brigades under its command , would advance along the French coastal route . The lighter forces of the 3rd and 5th Parachute and the two commando brigades would use the inland route . 
 When it was clear at 03 : 00 that the German Army in front of the division was pulling back , the first divisional unit to follow up was the 3rd Parachute Brigade . By 07 : 00 Bures was occupied by the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions and by 08 : 00 the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was in the Bois de Bavent . The rest of the division started advancing around the same time . The 4th Special Service Brigade headed for Troan and Saint Pair , while the 1st Special Service Brigade made for Bavent and Robehomme . In the north , the 6th Airlanding Brigade started moving along the road from Bréville to Merville . 
 = = = Northern sector = = = 
 The 6th Airlanding Brigade , with the Belgians and Dutch under its command , had to contend with German delaying tactics . The lead battalions advanced under heavy mortar and machine gun fire , until stopped by a strong defensive position at Cabourg . The 1st Battalion , Royal Ulster Rifles , unable to outflank the position , were ordered to dig in . The next day , the battalion was relieved by the Belgians and moved to a brigade concentration point , first at Le Plein and then at Troan , which they reached by the morning of 21 August . The 6th Airlanding Brigade advance continued from here with the 12th Battalion , Devonshire Regiment in the lead . The battalion was unopposed until that afternoon , when they had several casualties from German mortar and machine @-@ gun fire . With night approaching the battalion had to dig in , and prepared to continue the advance the next day . At 03 : 00 on 22 August , the battalion started an outflanking attack on <unk> , which they occupied by 08 : 00 , and later the same day they liberated <unk> and Deauville , where they secured the high ground to the north of the town . 
 On 23 August a reconnaissance patrol from the 1st Battalion , Royal Ulster Rifles crossed the River Touques by boat , but German resistance in the area was too heavy for the battalion to cross . Instead they moved upriver , intending to cross at <unk> sur Touques . Intelligence reported that the railway embankment on the river was held in force by the Germans , and this put attempts to cross the river there on hold . Elsewhere the 2nd Battalion , Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry reached the river . Major John Howard and his D Company swam across and established the battalion 's bridgehead . With local French assistance and a collection of small boats and rafts , the rest of the battalion were also able to cross the river , entering Touques on 24 August . The next day they liberated Saint Philibert , La Correspondence and <unk> , and reached Malhortie where the Germans were still defending the bridge and high ground . At 13 : 00 , the battalion assaulted and captured the bridge intact , but German resistance prevented them from proceeding any further . On 26 August the advance continued , and at 19 : 00 Foulbec was liberated . Circumstances had divided the 6th Airlanding Brigade 's forces , and they were now advancing along two routes , with the Belgian and Dutch brigades along the coast and the airlanding battalions further inland . The 6th Airlanding Brigade battalions headed towards Honfleur and Berville sur Mer , meeting slight German opposition , while the Belgians occupied the area around Berville and Foulbec . 
 = = = Southern sector = = = 
 In the south , the 3rd Parachute Brigade started crossing the River Dives on 18 August , delayed by the need to build a crossing to replace the bridge destroyed by the division during Operation Tonga . By nightfall the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was engaging the German rearguard and the 8th Parachute Battalion reached the outskirts of Goustranville . The next morning the brigade advance continued into Goustranville , where they came under heavy artillery fire from the high ground at Putot . Their attack faltered and Gale decided to restart the advance that night . He ordered the 3rd Parachute Brigade to secure the start point along the Dives canal and railway line , while the 5th Parachute Brigade assaulted the artillery position at Putot . 
 At 22 : 00 the 3rd Parachute Brigade moved forward , capturing the two canal bridges intact , and 150 prisoners from the 744th Grenadier Regiment . By 01 : 00 on 19 August , they were on the outskirts of <unk> , but were then targeted by German artillery , causing several casualties . At the same time the 5th Parachute Brigade crossed the canal further south . The 7th Parachute Battalion were ordered to secure the area to the east of Putot @-@ en @-@ Auge , while the 12th Parachute Battalion assaulted the village . En route , the 7th Parachute Battalion came under fire from German machine @-@ guns , then observed a line of troops approaching them . Initially thought to be the 13th Parachute Battalion they were soon identified as Germans , and the battalion ambushed them at a distance of 25 yards ( 23 m ) , causing severe casualties to the Germans . 
 When the 13th Parachute Battalion advanced close enough to Hill 13 , they carried out a bayonet charge on the summit . However , they arrived at the same time as a battalion of German reinforcements , who immediately counter @-@ attacked , forcing the battalion back , inflicting several casualties . A follow @-@ up attack by the Germans on the withdrawing British was stopped by an artillery barrage . During this time the 12th Parachute Battalion captured Putot @-@ en @-@ Auge , taking 160 prisoners and several heavy weapons . 
 The next day , 21 August , the 3rd Parachute Brigade advanced towards the River Touques at Pont @-@ l 'Évêque , fighting through a German infantry and armour position at Annebault . The village was eventually captured by the 8th Parachute Battalion after some heavy fighting . Here the brigade held firm while the 5th Parachute Brigade moved through them , and reached Pont @-@ l 'Évêque on 22 August . The 13th Parachute Battalion then led the brigade attack into the town ; their objective was to cross both branches of the Touques in the town and form a bridgehead on the northern bank . At the same time the 12th Parachute Battalion would cross further upriver and secure a railway embankment at Saint Julien . At 15 : 00 the Royal Artillery laid down a smoke barrage to cover the advance of the 12th Parachute Battalion . The Germans opened fire when they were around 400 yards ( 370 m ) from the river ; only ten men from the battalion succeeded in crossing , and then became trapped on the far bank . Running low on ammunition , and without support , they eventually withdrew . The 13th Parachute Battalion fought its way into the town and across the first branch of the river , but German resistance was heavy and they could not get across the eastern branch . 
 On 22 August a patrol from the 13th Parachute Battalion succeeded in crossing the eastern branch of the river , and was quickly reinforced by the rest of the battalion . They fought for three hours to gain a proper foothold and were then forced to withdraw again . The next day , patrols from the 7th Parachute Battalion discovered that the Germans had withdrawn during the night , and they therefore crossed the river and secured the high ground to the north , closely followed by the rest of the brigade . On 25 August the 1st Special Service Brigade took over as the lead formation , and headed towards Beuzeville , but once again German defences held up the advance . The 3rd Parachute Brigade and the 4th Special Service Brigade carried out a left flanking attack to capture the village , suffering heavy losses from German mortar fire . 
 Later that day , Gale received orders that the 49th ( West Riding ) Infantry Division would take Pont Audemer . Convinced he was in a better position to capture the crossing over the River Risle there , he ordered the Netherlands Infantry Brigade to move and join the 5th Parachute Brigade in taking the town . On 26 August the men of the parachute brigade , some mounted on the Cromwell tanks of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment , raced towards the bridge from the east while the Dutch headed there from the west . The Dutch brigade arrived first , just minutes after the Germans destroyed the bridge , slightly ahead of the 7th Parachute Battalion . The Dutch brigade moved to secure the heights overlooking the river , while the 5th Parachute Brigade occupied the town .

 Having reached the River Seine , the division was ordered to hold firm between Honfleur and Pont Audemer and prepare to return to England . In nine days of fighting they had advanced 45 miles ( 72 km ) , despite , as the divisional commander Major @-@ General Gale put it , his infantry units being " quite inadequately equipped for a rapid pursuit , " captured 400 square miles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) of German held territory , and took more than 1 @,@ 000 German prisoners .

 = Derwent Valley Mills = 
 Derwent Valley Mills is a World Heritage Site along the River Derwent in Derbyshire , England , designated in December 2001 . It is administered by the Derwent Valley Mills Partnership . The modern factory , or ' mill ' , system was born here in the 18th century to accommodate the new technology for spinning cotton developed by Richard Arkwright . With advancements in technology , it became possible to produce cotton continuously . The system was adopted throughout the valley , and later spread so that by 1788 there were over 200 Arkwright @-@ type mills in Britain . Arkwright 's inventions and system of organising labour was exported to Europe and the United States . 
 Water @-@ power was first introduced to England by John Lombe at his silk mill in Derby in 1719 , but it was Richard Arkwright who applied water @-@ power to the process of producing cotton in the 1770s . His patent of a water frame allowed cotton to be spun continuously , meaning it could be produced by unskilled workers . Cromford Mill was the site of Arkwright 's first mill , with nearby Cromford village significantly expanded for his then @-@ new workforce ; this system of production and workers ' housing was copied throughout the valley . To ensure the presence of a labour force , it was necessary to construct housing for the mill workers . Thus , new settlements were established by mill owners around the mills – sometimes developing a pre @-@ existing community – with their own amenities such as schools , chapels , and markets . Most of the housing still exists and is still in use . Along with the transport infrastructure form part of the site . A transport infrastructure was built to open new markets for the mills ' produce . 
 Mills and workers ' settlements were established at Belper , Darley Abbey , and Milford by Arkwright 's competitors . Arkwright @-@ type mills were so successful that sometimes they were copied without paying royalties to Richard Arkwright . The cotton industry in the Derwent Valley went into decline in the first quarter of the 19th century as the market shifted towards Lancashire which was better position in relation to markets and raw materials . The mills and their associated buildings are well preserved and have been reused since the cotton industry declined . Many of the buildings within the World Heritage Site are also listed buildings and Scheduled Monuments . Some of the mills now contain museums and are open to the public . 
 = = Location and coverage = = 
 The Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site covers an area of 12 @.@ 3 km2 ( 4 @.@ 7 sq mi ) and spans a 24 km ( 15 mi ) stretch of the Derwent Valley , in Derbyshire , from Matlock Bath in the north to Derby city centre in the south . Within the site are mill complexes , settlements including workers ' housing , weirs on the River Derwent , and the transport network that supported the mills in the valley . The site consists of the communities of Cromford , Belper , Milford , and Darley Abbey , and includes 838 listed buildings , made up of 16 Grade I , 42 Grade II * , and 780 Grade II . A further nine structures are Scheduled Ancient Monuments . The buildings are a mixture of mills , workers ' housing , and structures associated with the mill communities . The Cromford Canal and Cromford and High Peak Railway , which aided the industrialisation of the area , are also part of the World Heritage Site . 
 = = History = = 
 In the late 17th century silk making expanded due to demand for silk as part of fashionable garments . In an attempt to increase production through the use of water power , Thomas <unk> commissioned engineer George <unk> to build a mill near the centre of Derby on an island in the River Derwent . Although the experiment was unsuccessful , it convinced John Lombe – an employee of <unk> – that if water power could be perfected there was a market for its produce . He engaged in industrial espionage and gained plans of Italian machines . He patented the design in 1719 and built a five @-@ storey mill 33 @.@ 5 m × 12 m ( 110 ft × 39 ft ) next to <unk> 's mill . By 1763 , 30 years after Lombe 's patent had expired , only seven Lombe mills had been built because the silk market was small , but Lombe had introduced a viable form of water powered machinery and had established a template for organised labour that later industrialists would follow . 
 As silk was a luxury good , the market was small and easily saturated by machine produced goods . The next innovation in machine produced textiles came in the cotton industry which had a much wider market and produced more affordable goods . Spinning cotton was a more complex process than silk production . The water frame for spinning cotton was developed by Richard Arkwright and patented in 1769 . The machines could spin yarn continuously and replaced skilled workers with unskilled supervisors to make sure the machines didn 't break . Water frames varied in size from 4 to 96 spindles . For these reasons , the water frame became popular and widespread . In 1771 , Richard Arkwright took a lease on land in Cromford . By 1774 , his first mill was operational , and in 1776 he began construction of a second mill at Cromford . During this time , he developed machines for pre @-@ spinning and in 1775 took out his second patent . With spinning mechanised , the other processes involved in producing cotton could not keep up and also required mechanisation . He produced a machine for carding , the process which laid out the cotton fibres parallel , however not all his inventions were successful and cleaning the cotton was performed by hand until the 1790s when an effective machine was invented . 
 Arkwright sought financial assistance , and Peter Nightingale – a local landowner ( and grand uncle of Florence Nightingale ) – bought the Cromford Estate for £ 20 @,@ 000 ( £ 2 million as of 2016 ) . Nightingale also built Rock House as a residence for Arkwright , overlooking the mill , and gave him a further £ 2 @,@ 000 ( £ 230 @,@ 000 ) to build the second mill and £ 1 @,@ 750 ( £ 200 @,@ 000 ) for workers ' housing . Between 1777 and 1783 , Arkwright and his family built mills at Bakewell , <unk> , Rocester , and Wirksworth , spread across Derbyshire and Staffordshire . Jedediah Strutt , who was Arkwright 's partner in the first Cromford Mill , built mills at Belper and Milford in 1776 – 1881 . Thomas Evans , a land over in Darley Abbey , bought a further 7 @.@ 1 ha ( 18 acres ) in the area around Darley Abbey at a cost of £ 1 @,@ 140 ( £ 130 @,@ 000 ) and in 1782 built a cotton mill in the village . Arkwright was paid royalties by those who had copied his machines , although some people risked prosecution by engaging in piracy . 
 The construction of Masson Mill in Matlock Bath began in 1783 , instigated by Arkwright . Contemporaneous with Arkwright 's expansionism was the entry of Jedediah Strutt into the cotton spinning industry . Strutt had the advantage that Arkwright had already done all the necessary experimentation with machinery , so he did not have to invest in researching new technology . He established a mill at Belper , about 8 mi ( 13 km ) south of Cromford ; it was probably complete in 1781 . The site was expanded with the addition of a second mill in 1784 . Strutt also built a mill in Milford , about 2 mi ( 3 km ) south of Belper . By 1793 , two further mills were added for printing and bleaching . The Strutts estimated that by 1789 they had invested £ 37 @,@ 000 ( £ 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ) in theirs mills at Belper and Milford ( £ 26 @,@ 000 at Belper and £ 11 @,@ 000 at Milford ) , and had a return of £ 36 @,@ 000 ( £ 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ) per year . 
 Arkwright had a reputation as a paternalistic employer who was concerned for the well @-@ being of his employees and their families . A Sunday School was built at Cromford in 1785 and provided education to 200 children . By 1789 , the Cromford Estate was back in the ownership of the <unk> , who actively influenced its structure and construction . Cromford was given a market place to act as a new focus for the village . Arkwright organised a market every Sunday and as incentive to attend , gave annual prizes to those who attended most often . After Arkwright died in 1792 his son , Richard Arkwright junior , took over and sold most of his cotton mills outside Cromford and Matlock Bath . The mills in Cromford and Matlock Bath were probably retained to support the <unk> Estate . Societies and clubs were created in Cromford . The religious affairs of the community were of less interest to Arkwright , and it was not until 1797 that Arkwright junior established Cromford Church ; his father had envisaged it as a private chapel for the Arkwright family at <unk> Castle . The family 's attempts to make Cromford self @-@ sustaining through establishing a market was successful , and the village expanded until about 1840 . This was even though the mills had passed their zenith and begun to enter decline in this period . 
 Richard Arkwright junior was uninterested in the cotton business , and after the death of his father the Arkwright family ceased to invest in the industry . The Strutt family continued to invest , fuelled by the profits of their mills in Milford and Belper . They continued building mills into the 1810s , and by 1833 their business employed 2 @,@ 000 people and had dominated the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley . As Arkwright had done at Cromford , the Strutts provided housing for their employees . Belper was already an established village with its own market before Jedediah Strutt began building mills , so he was not required to have as active a role in developing the community into a self @-@ sustaining entity as Richard Arkwright did at Cromford . The Strutts provided education , and in 1817 650 and 300 children attended Sunday Schools in Belper and Milford respectively . Compared with Cromford , whose population had plateaued at around 1 @,@ 200 in the early 19th century , the population of Belper rose from 4 @,@ 500 in 1801 to 7 @,@ 890 in 1831 due to the prosperity of the business . Darley Abbey also expanded as a worker 's settlement although it had no market place , so providing food for the inhabitants was problematic . The settlement doubled in size between 1788 and 1801 , and between 1801 and 1831 the population increased from 615 to 1 @,@ 170 with the addition of much worker 's housing . A Sunday School for 80 children was established in one of the mills and a church and school were built in 1819 and 1826 respectively . 
 Despite being a major power of the cotton industry in the first quarter of the 19th century , the Strutts ' company began to lose out to competition from Lancashire mill towns . The problem of shifting markets affected the entire Derwent Valley ; Lancashire was better situated than Derbyshire in relation to the raw materials and new markets . The mills run by the Strutt family also suffered from a lack of modernisation ; although they were at the forefront of fireproofing technology at the start of the 19th century , as the machines the mills used got bigger and more powerful , the Strutts persevered with child labour where adults would have been more adept at using the machinery . The company declined and in the second half of the 19th century some of its mills were leased or sold off to other companies . Although the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley declined , many of the structures associated with the industrial processes associated with producing cotton and workers ' housing has survived and there are 848 listed buildings in the World Heritage Site . 
 = = Transport = = 
 = = = Cromford canal = = = 
 The Erewash Canal , begun in 1777 , was intended to primarily transport coal . It flowed from the River Trent in Sawley to Langley Mill , 14 mi ( 23 km ) south of Cromford . In 1788 , Richard Arkwright asked William Jessop to estimate the cost of building a canal connecting the mills at Cromford to Langley Mill . The figure Jessop came up with was £ 42 @,@ 000 ( £ 5 million as of 2016 ) which was raised within a couple of weeks . Local mill owners Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans opposed the proposed canal , fearing it would interfere with the water supply for their own mills , but in 1789 Parliament granted permission to construct the canal . 
 When the Cromford Canal was opened in 1794 , it had cost nearly twice Jessop 's original estimate . Between Langley Mill and Cromford Wharf , where the canal terminated in the mill complex , the canal crossed two aqueducts , traversed 3 @,@ 000 yd ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) of tunnel beneath some ironworks at Bull Bridge , and fourteen locks . Three quarters of the cargo transported on the canal was coal and coke , while the rest consisted of gritstone , iron ore , and lead . When the Derby and Nottingham Canals were completed by Jessop and Benjamin Outram in 1796 , they provided direct routes to the important textile centres of Derby and Nottingham . In January 1845 , the Cromford Canal Company decided to have a permanent pump built to provide enough water during dry conditions . This was made by Graham and Company at the Milton Iron Works , <unk> . The canal was successful until the mid 19th century when the Manchester , Buxton , Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway extended its line south of the canal . In 1852 , the canal was sold to the railway company which accelerated its decline . By 1889 the canal was mostly used for local traffic . It was eventually closed in 1944 as the cost of maintaining and repairing the canal were too great . Derbyshire County Council acquired the canal in 1974 and the Cromford Canal Society undertook the task of restoring it . 
 = = = Cromford and High Peak Railway = = = 
 In the early 19th century , a canal had been proposed to connect the Peak Forest Canal , which terminated at Whaley Bridge , with the Cromford Canal , providing a direct route between markets in Lancashire and Derbyshire . However , costs were prohibitive and the plan was abandoned . Josias Jessop , the son of William Jessop , believed that a wagonway would be much cheaper than a canal . On 2 May 1825 an Act of Parliament for the construction of a railway from Cromford to Whaley Bridge was passed . The proposal – backed by William Cavendish , 6th Duke of Devonshire , Richard Arkwright junior , and several Manchester bankers – was ambitious ; it was expected that steam locomotives would be used on the line , even though the technology was in its infancy and George Stephenson did not build his revolutionary Rocket until 1829 . The south part of the railway , from Cromford Wharf to <unk> , south east of Buxton , opened on 29 May 1830 , and on 6 July 1831 the rest of the line opened to Whaley Bridge . The first steam locomotive on the line was introduced in 1841 ; before that , the traffic had been made up entirely of wagons . 
 The railway ascended from 277 ft ( 84 m ) above sea level at Cromford Wharf to a height of 1 @,@ 264 ft ( 385 m ) above sea level at <unk> , before descending to 747 ft ( 228 m ) at the wharves of the Peak Forest Canal . The changes in height , which would have necessitated many locks for a canal , was relatively easy for a railway . However , for a time the <unk> and High Peak Railway did have the sharpest curve out of all railways in Britain and the steepest incline for vehicles without steam power . The construction of the railway cost was £ 180 @,@ 000 , higher than the original estimate of £ 155 @,@ 000 ( £ 12 million and £ 10 million respectively as of 2016 ) but much lower than the £ 500 @,@ 000 the canal was predicted to cost ( £ 32 million as of 2016 ) . Having been built to connect the Peak Forest and Cromford Canals , the railways fortunes were closely tied with those of the canals . The line was not profitable as by the time it had opened traffic had declined along the Cromford Canal . In 1855 , an Act of Parliament allowed the line to transport passengers as well as freight . Although passenger travel became more important to the railway , it went into decline and closed on 21 April 1967 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Derwent Valley is considered the birthplace of the factory system . The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production . Richard Arkwright 's Cromford Mill and the associated workers ' settlement provided a template for industrial communities , not just in the valley but internationally . The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers ; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families . The success of Arkwright 's model lead to other industrialists copying him . Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale , Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper , Milford , and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees . As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour , the industrialists were also concerned for their employees and families and acted out of a sense of paternalism . 
 Arkwright 's innovations were not confined to developing workers ' settlements ; he also had patents on many technologies used for water @-@ powered spinning . They were so successful that rival industrialists risked legal action by copying his designs . His patents expired in 1785 , and by 1788 over 200 Arkwright type mills had been founded in Britain . New Lanark in Scotland – also a World Heritage Site – was directly influenced by Richard Arkwright and the developments in the Derwent Valley ; Lanark was identified as a potential site for a mill on a visit by David Dale and Arkwright in 1784 . Dale later established four mills at Lanark ; they were structurally similar to Arkwright 's Masson Mill and at least two of the mills used technology developed in the Derwent Valley , although the factory system was different from that used in the Derwent Valley . New Lanark was acquired by Robert Owen in 1799 who developed paternalism further than had been done in the Derwent Valley , experimenting with education for young and old and social control . Saltaire – another World Heritage Site – was founded in 1853 and featured worker 's housing and facilities , as well as other elements of the factory system developed by Arkwright . 
 In 1774 , the British government passed an act outlawing the export of " tools or utensils " used in the cotton and linen industries . As a result , the only way for the new technologies being developed in Britain to spread to other countries was through industrial espionage . Carl Delius worked in England and gave plans for many of Arkwright 's inventions to Johann Gottfried <unk> ; <unk> used the information to establish a mill in <unk> , near Düsseldorf , which began production in 1784 . He named the settlement associated with the mill Cromford . The mill was the first Arkwright mill in mainland Europe . The techniques for spinning cotton developed in the Derwent Valley were also spread to America . In 1790 , the United States had less than 2 @,@ 000 spindles which were powered by spinning <unk> , compared to 2 @.@ 4 million machine driven spindles in Britain at the same time . The Arkwright mill was introduced to America by unskilled migrants from England , many of them being unskilled . Among them was Samuel Slater who was from the Derwent Valley and an apprentice of Jedediah Strutt . He founded Slater Mill . Many of the technologies developed in the Derwent Valley Mills endured and were adopted for other textile industries ; until the mid @-@ 20th century , carding was still performed with machinery invented by Richard Arkwright . The factory system made it possible to produce cheap textiles and clothing . 
 = = Preservation = = 
 Out of the Arkwright Festival held in 1971 , The Arkwright Society was formed . The Cromford Mill complex was bought by The Arkwright Society in 1979 , saving the buildings associated with the mill from demolition . The <unk> purchased the site for the purpose of conservation and with the intention of beginning restoration . The mills had been contaminated by industrial processes involving pigments and dyes which were stored in the mills after they stopped processing cotton . With the help of local councils , the East Midlands Development Agency , English Heritage , the Heritage Lottery Fund , and at the cost of £ 5 million , the mills were restored and decontaminated . Now Cromford Mill is now used by small businesses and used for education . 
 Many of the mills built in the Derwent Valley for the cotton industry survive and were reused after the decline of the industry . Some have been reused . Most of the worker 's housing survives and are still in used as homes . Throughout the 1970s and 1980s , local authorities in partnership with English Heritage attempted to prevent the deterioration of the houses and mills by giving advice to owners and using grants to undertake conservation work . When the application for World Heritage Site status was made in 2000 , 26 of the 838 listed buildings in the area were on English Heritage 's At Risk Register and were in a state of disrepair . 
 In 2000 , the Derwent Valley Mills were nominated to become a World Heritage Site . Along with Blaenavon Industrial Landscape , New Lanark , and Saltaire ( all now World Heritage Sites ) , the site was proposed to increase the representation of industrial archaeology on the list of World Heritage Sites . The proposal was successful and in 2001 the Derwent Valley Mills were designated a World Heritage Site . Its status as a World Heritage Site is intended to ensure its protection ; all such sites are considered to be of " outstanding value to humanity " . The site was listed under the second and fourth Heritage Site selection criteria . The Derwent Valley Mills pioneered worker 's housing as well as much technology developed by Richard Arkwright , producing an industrial landscape and heralding industrial towns . The Derwent Valley Mills Partnership is responsible , on behalf of the British government , for the management of the site . In June 2009 , Bath Street Mill in Derby was damaged by fire . The building was part of the World Heritage Site and dated from the 18th century . 
 = = = Museums = = = 
 Richard Arkwright 's Masson Mill is now a working textile museum with the largest collection of bobbins in the world . 
 Leawood <unk> is now a working museum which still does the original job of pumping water from the Derwent to Cromford Canal , Open on selected weekends . 
 At Belper , while much of the site has been converted to other business uses , the Belper North Mill building houses the Derwent Valley Visitor Centre . This features displays of machinery and other items associated with the history of the Derwent Valley textile industry . 
 At the extreme southern end of the site , Lombe 's Silk Mill now houses the Derby Industrial Museum . This museum closed on 3 April 2011 and was mothballed for over two years . 
 In October 2013 a programme started to reinvent the silk mill for the 21st Century , incorporating the principles of <unk> ( Science , Technology , Engineering , Art and Maths ) . The museum now opens 4 days a week . 
 = Space Interferometry Mission = 
 The Space Interferometry Mission , or SIM , also known as SIM Lite ( formerly known as SIM <unk> ) , was a planned space telescope developed by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , in conjunction with contractor Northrop Grumman . One of the main goals of the mission was the hunt for Earth @-@ sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of nearby stars other than the Sun . SIM was postponed several times and finally cancelled in 2010 . 
 In addition to hunting for extrasolar planets , SIM would have helped astronomers construct a map of the Milky Way galaxy . Other important tasks would have included collecting data to help pinpoint stellar masses for specific types of stars , assisting in the determination of the spatial distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way and in the Local Group of galaxies and using the gravitational microlensing effect to measure the mass of stars . 
 The spacecraft would have used optical interferometry to accomplish these and other scientific goals . This technique collects light with multiple mirrors ( in SIM 's case , two ) which is combined to make an interference pattern which can be very precisely measured . 
 The initial contracts for SIM Lite were awarded in 1998 , totaling US $ 200 million . Work on the SIM project required scientists and engineers to move through eight specific new technology milestones , and by November 2006 , all eight had been completed . 
 SIM Lite was originally scheduled for a 2005 launch , aboard an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle ( EELV ) . As a result of continued budget cuts , the launch date was pushed back at least five times . NASA had set a preliminary launch date for 2015 and U.S. federal budget documents confirmed that a launch date was expected " no earlier " than 2015 . As of February 2007 , many of the engineers working on the SIM program had moved on to other areas and projects , and NASA directed the project to allocate its resources toward engineering risk reduction . However , the preliminary budget for NASA for 2008 included zero dollars for SIM . 
 In December 2007 , the Congress restored funding for fiscal year 2008 as part of an omnibus appropriations bill which the President later signed . At the same time the Congress directed NASA to move the mission forward to the development phase . In 2009 the project continued its risk reduction work while waiting for the findings and recommendations of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey , Astro2010 , performed by the National Academy of Sciences , which would determine the project 's future . 
 On 13 August 2010 , the Astro2010 Decadal Report was released and did not recommend that NASA continue the development of the SIM Lite Astrometric Observatory . This prompted NASA Astronomy and Physics Director , Jon Morse , to issue a letter on 24 September 2010 to the SIM Lite project manager , informing him that NASA was discontinuing its sponsorship of the SIM Lite mission and directing the project to discontinue Phase B activities immediately or as soon as practical . Accordingly , all SIM Lite activities were closed down by the end of calendar year 2010 . 
 = = Mission = = 
 SIM Lite would have operated in an Earth @-@ trailing heliocentric orbit . The SIM would have drifted away from Earth at the rate of 0 @.@ 1 AU per year . At the end of the planned mission , it would have reached a distance of 82 million km from Earth . This would have taken approximately 5 1 ⁄ 2 years . The Sun would have continuously shone on the spacecraft , allowing it to avoid the occultations of target stars and eclipses of the sun that would occur in an Earth orbit . 
 Had it been launched , SIM would have performed scientific research for five years . 
 = = = Planet hunting = = = 
 SIM Lite would have been the most powerful extrasolar planet hunting space telescope ever built . Through the technique of interferometry the spacecraft would be able to detect Earth @-@ sized planets . SIM Lite was to perform its search for nearby , Earth @-@ like planets by looking for the " wobble " in the parent star 's apparent motion as the planet orbits . The spacecraft will accomplish this task to an accuracy of one millionth of an arcsecond , or the thickness of a nickel viewed at the distance from Earth to the Moon . Titled the Deep Search , the planet hunting program is intended to search approximately 60 nearby stars for terrestrial planets ( like Earth and Venus ) in the habitable zone ( where liquid water can exist throughout a full revolution ( one " year " ) of the planet around its star ) . The Deep Search is the most demanding in terms of astrometric accuracy , hence the name , Deep Search . This program will use the full capability of the SIM Lite spacecraft to make its measurements . 
 A flexible search strategy tunes SIM Lite 's mass sensitivity at each star to a desired level in the habitable planet search . The value of <unk> ( Eta _ Earth ) , the fraction of stars carrying Earth @-@ analog planets , will be estimated by the Kepler Mission some time before SIM Lite launches . One strategy for a habitable planet search is to do a ' deeper ' search ( i.e. to lower mass sensitivity in the habitable zone ) of a smaller number of targets if Earth analogs are common . A ' shallower ' search of a larger number of targets could be done if Earth analogs are rarer . For example , assuming that 40 % of mission time is allocated for the planet search , SIM Lite could survey : 
 65 stars for planets down to one Earth mass , in scaled 1 AU orbits , OR 
 149 stars for planets down to two Earth masses , in scaled 1 AU orbits , OR 
 239 stars for planets down to three Earth masses , in scaled 1 AU orbits . 
 Aside from searching for Earth @-@ sized planets SIM Lite was scheduled to perform what has been dubbed the " Broad Survey " . The Broad Survey would have looked at approximately 1 @,@ 500 stars to help determine the abundance of Neptune @-@ mass and larger planets around all star @-@ types in Earth 's sector of the Milky Way . 
 A third part of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter @-@ mass planets around young stars . The survey would have helped scientists understand more about solar system formation , including the occurrence of hot Jupiters . This portion of the planet hunt is designed to study systems with one or more Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium . Planet hunting techniques using a star 's radial velocity cannot measure the regular , tiny to @-@ and @-@ fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star . It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM will be able to execute its three primary planet @-@ finding missions . 
 The mission 's planet finding component was set up to serve as an important complement to the future missions designed to image and measure terrestrial and other exoplanets . SIM Lite will perform an important task that these missions will not be capable of : determining planet masses . Another task that the SIM was envisioned to perform for the future missions will include providing the orbital characteristics of the planets . With this knowledge other missions can estimate the optimal times and projected star – planet separation angles for them to observe the terrestrial ( and other ) planets SIM has detected . 
 = = = Stellar mass = = = 
 Another key aspect of SIM Lite 's future mission was determining the upper and lower limits of star 's masses . Today , scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be . Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion , which is what causes a star to shine . These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent the lower end of the stellar mass scale . Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova . 
 Part of the SIM 's mission is to provide pinpoint measurements for the two extremes in stellar mass and evolution . The telescope will not be able to measure the mass of every star in the Galaxy , since there are over 200 billion , but instead , it will take a " population census . " Through this technique , SIM will be able to output accurate masses for representative examples for nearly every star type , including brown dwarfs , hot white dwarfs , red giant stars , and elusive black holes . Current space telescopes , including NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope , can accurately measure mass for some types of stars , but not all . Estimates put the range for stellar mass somewhere between 8 % the mass of the Sun and in excess of 60 times the mass of the Sun . The entire study will be focused on binary star systems , stars coupled through a mutual gravitational attraction . 
 = = = Galactic mapping = = = 
 Interferometric measurements of stellar positions over the course of the mission would have permitted SIM to precisely measure the distances between stars throughout the Milky Way . This would have allowed astronomers to create a " roadmap " of the Galaxy which will answer many questions about its shape and size . 
 Currently , astronomers know little about the shape and size of our galaxy relative to what they know about other galaxies ; it is difficult to observe the entire Milky Way from the inside . A good analogy is trying to observe a marching band as a member of the band . Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies . Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars . 
 SIM Lite measurements of Milky Way stars were to yield data to understand four topics : fundamental Galactic parameters , the Oort Limit , disk mass potential , and mass of the Galaxy to large radii . The first , fundamental Galactic parameters , was aimed at answering key questions about the size , shape and the rotation rate of the Milky Way . The team hoped to more accurately determine the distance from the Sun to the Galactic center . The second topic , the Oort Limit , would have attempted to determine the mass of the Galactic disk . 
 The third project topic was disk mass potential . This topic was designed to make measurements of the distances to disk stars as well as their proper motions . The results of the third topic of study were to be combined with the results of the fundamental Galactic parameters portion of the study to determine the Solar System 's position and velocity in the Galaxy . The final topic dealt with dark matter distribution in the Milky Way . SIM data was to be used to create a three @-@ dimensional model of mass distribution in the Galaxy , out to a radius of 270 kiloparsecs ( <unk> ) . They were to then use two different tests to determine the Galactic potential at large radii . 
 = = = Dark matter = = = 
 Dark matter is the matter in the universe that cannot be seen . Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies , scientists know that approximately 80 % of the matter in the universe is dark matter . The spatial distribution of dark matter in the universe is largely unknown ; SIM Lite will help scientists determine an answer to this question through another integral part of its mission . 
 The strongest evidence for dark matter comes from galactic motion . Galaxies rotate much faster than the amount of visible matter suggests they should ; the gravity from the ordinary matter is not enough to hold the galaxy together . Scientists theorize that the galaxy is held together by huge quantities of dark matter . Similarly , clusters of galaxies do not appear to have enough visible matter to gravitationally balance the high speed motions of their component galaxies . 
 Besides measuring stellar motions within the Milky Way , SIM Lite will measure the internal and average galactic motion of some of the neighboring galaxies near the Milky Way . Many of these measurements will be the first of their kind . The telescope 's measurements will be used in conjunction with other , currently available , data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies . These numbers will enable scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of dark matter in the Local Group of galaxies , and by extension throughout the universe .

 The Space Interferometry Mission began as a four @-@ month preliminary architecture study in March 1997 . NASA selected TRW 's Space & Electronics Group , Eastman Kodak and Hughes Danbury Optical Systems to conduct the study . In 1998 , TRW Inc. was selected as the contractor for the SIM Lite project ; Northrup Grumman acquired part of TRW in 2002 and took over the contract . Also selected was Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space located in Sunnyvale , California . The two contracts , which included the mission formulation and implementation phases , were announced in September 1998 and worth a total of over US $ 200 million . The formulation phase of the mission included initial mission design and planning for the full scale implementation of the mission . At the time of the NASA announcement , launch was scheduled for 2005 and the mission was part of the Origins Program , a series of missions designed to answer questions such as how and why humans are on Earth . 
 In August 2000 , NASA asked project managers to consider looking at the Space Shuttle , instead of the previously proposed EELV , as a launch vehicle . In late November 2000 , NASA announced that the project 's scientific team was selected . The group included notable names from the world of extrasolar planet research including Geoffrey Marcy . The entire group consisted of 10 principal investigators and five mission specialists . At the time of this NASA announcement launch was scheduled for 2009 and the mission was still part of the Origins Program . 
 = = = New technologies = = = 
 SIM 's new technology is meant to lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth @-@ like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life . NASA has already started developing future missions that will build on SIM 's technological legacy . The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight , mission @-@ technology @-@ milestones set by NASA were reached . The milestones were necessary steps in the technological development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed . The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for nanometer control as well as <unk> knowledge technology ; these systems enable the telescope to make its accurate measurements with such extreme accuracy . 
 One of the new technologies developed for the mission were high @-@ tech " rulers " , capable of making measurements in increments a fraction of the width of a hydrogen atom . In addition , the rulers were developed to work as a network . The mission team also created " shock absorbers " to alleviate the effects of tiny vibrations in the spacecraft which would impede accurate measurements . Another one of the milestones involved combining the new " rulers " and " shock absorbers " to prove that the Space Interferometry Mission craft could detect the tiny wobbles in stars caused by Earth @-@ sized planets . The fifth of the technology milestones required the demonstration of the <unk> Metrology Testbed at a performance of 3 @,@ 200 picometers over its wide angle field of regard . The wide angle measurements will be used to determine the fixed positions of stars each time they are measured . This level of performance demonstrated SIM Lite 's ability to calculate the astrometric grid . Another key development , known as <unk> narrow @-@ angle astrometry ( <unk> ) , was the ability to apply the measurement capability worked out in the wide angle milestone and take it a step further , into narrow @-@ angle measurements . Aiming to give an accuracy of 1 micro @-@ arcsecond to the early stages of the SIM , the technique allows star positions to be measured without first setting up a grid of reference stars ; instead , it sets up a reference frame using several reference stars and a target star observed from different locations , and star positions are calculated using delay measurements from the separate observations . The narrow angle field will be used by SIM to detect terrestrial planets ; the team applied the same criteria to both the narrow and wide angle measurements . The final requirement before beginning work on flight controls was to make sure that all of the systems developed for the mission worked cohesively ; this final NASA technology goal was completed last as it was dependent upon the others . 
 = = = Status after 2006 = = = 
 Between the end of April and June 2006 the project completed three engineering milestones and from 2 – 8 November 2006 SIM completed a " Spacecraft Internal Design Review . " As of June 2008 , all of the eight engineering milestones have been successfully completed . 
 The project has been in Phase B since June 2003 , ( and that is still the case as of July 2010 ) . Jet Propulsion Laboratory 's " Phase B " is called the " Preliminary Design " phase . Phase B further develops the mission concept developed during Phase A to prepare the project for entry into the Implementation Phase of the project . Requirements are defined , schedules are determined , and specifications are prepared to initiate system design and development . " In addition , as part of Phase B , the SIM Lite project will go through a number of reviews by NASA including System Requirements Review , System Design Review , and Non @-@ Advocate Review . During this phase , experiments will be proposed , peer reviewed , and eventually selected by NASA 's Office of Space Science . Experiment selections are based on scientific value , cost , management , engineering , and safety . 
 = = = Planned launch = = = 
 The launch date for the SIM Lite mission was pushed back at least five times . At the program 's outset , in 1998 , the launch was scheduled for 2005 . By 2000 , the launch date had been delayed until 2009 , a date that held through 2003 ; though some project scientists cited 2008 in late 2000 . Between 2004 and 2006 , contractor Northrop Grumman , the company designing and developing SIM , listed a launch date of 2011 on their website . With the release of the FY 2007 NASA budget , predictions changed again , this time to a date no earlier than 2015 or 2016 . The delay of the launch date was primarily related to budget cuts made to the SIM Lite program . The 2007 change represented a difference of about three years from the 2006 launch date , outlined in NASA 's FY 2006 budget as being two years behind 2005 budget predictions . Other groups predicted dates matching officially predicted launch dates ; the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute ( formerly the Michelson Science Center ) at the California Institute of Technology also sets the date at 2015 . As of June 2008 , NASA has postponed the launch date " indefinitely " . 
 A May 2005 NASA operating plan put the mission into a replanning phase through the spring of 2006 . The launch was planned to be via an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle ( EELV ) , likely an Atlas V 521 or equivalent .

 SIM Lite is considered the flagship mission of NASA 's Exoplanet Exploration Program ( formerly known as the Navigator Program ) . According to the 2007 Presidential Budget for NASA , the program is , " a coherent series of increasingly challenging projects , each complementary to the others and each mission building on the results and capabilities of those that preceded it as NASA searches for habitable planets outside of the solar system . " The program , in addition to the Space Interferometry Mission , includes the Keck Interferometer and the Large <unk> Telescope Interferometer . When originally approved in 1996 , the mission was given a $ 700 million cap ( in 1996 dollars ) which included launch costs and five years of operation . The first contracts , for the preliminary architecture study , were worth $ 200 @,@ 000 each . 
 NASA 's budget outlined plans for the three projects for fiscal year ( FY ) 2007 . Of the three missions , SIM Lite was delayed further and the Keck Interferometer saw budget cuts . The 2007 NASA budget stipulated , " SIM Phase B activity will continue while new cost and schedule plans are developed , consistent with recent funding decisions . " The funding decisions included a US $ 118 @.@ 5 million cut over the FY 2006 NASA budget request for the Exoplanet Exploration Program . The budget also laid out projections for the program through the year 2010 . Each year will have successive funding cuts , if compared to the 2006 request numbers . Starting with FY 2008 , the Exoplanet Exploration Program will receive around $ 223 @.@ 9 million less compared to 2006 . The following years will have cuts of $ 155 @.@ 2 million in 2009 and $ 172 @.@ 5 million in 2010 , compared to the 2006 request . 
 When SIM Lite entered what JPL terms " Phase B " in 2003 Fringes : Space Interferometry Mission Newsletter , called it a most important milestone on the way to a 2009 launch . The delays are budgetary in nature . In 2006 , the mission received $ 117 million , an increase of $ 8 @.@ 1 million over the previous year , but 2007 cuts amounted to $ 47 @.@ 9 million less for the SIM program . In 2008 , $ 128 @.@ 7 million of the $ 223 @.@ 9 million estimated to be cut from the Exoplanet Program budget will come from the SIM Lite mission . After an additional $ 51 @.@ 9 million decrease in FY 2009 , the program was reduced to $ 6 million in FY 2010 supplemented by substantial carryover from the previous year while awaiting the results of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey , Astro2010 . 
 By February 2007 many of the budget cuts outlined in the FY 2007 budget were already being felt within the project . Engineers who worked on SIM were forced to find other areas to work in . A February 2007 editorial in the Space Interferometry Mission Newsletter described the situation as , " entirely due to budget pressures and priorities within the Science Mission Directorate at NASA ( with ) scientific motivation for the mission ... as strong as ever . " NASA , per the budget cuts , directed the SIM project to refocus its efforts toward engineering risk reduction . As of the February 2007 newsletter the plans for the refocus were in the process of being completed . 
 SIM Lite project status as of April 2009 and August 2009 can be found on the JPL SIM public web site in the form of two submissions to the National Research Council ( NRC ) Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey ( Astro2010 ) Request for Information , Part 1 and Part 2 . While these documents use a 2015 launch date for reference in communicating schedule and budget , NASA has not yet set a launch date for SIM Lite and will not do so until after the Astro2010 Decadal report is released in mid- to late 2010 .

 = = = Optical interferometry = = = 
 Interferometry is a technique pioneered by Albert A. Michelson in the 19th century . Optical interferometry , which has matured within the last two decades , combines the light of multiple telescopes so that exquisitely precise measurements can be made , akin to what might be accomplished with a single , much larger telescope . It is the interaction of light waves , called interference , that makes this possible . Interference can be used to cancel out the glare of bright stars or to measure distances and angles accurately . The construction of the word partially illustrates this : interfere + measure = <unk> @-@ o @-@ <unk> . At radio wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum , interferometry has been used for more than 50 years to measure the structure of distant galaxies . 
 The SIM Lite telescope functions through optical interferometry . SIM is composed of one science interferometer ( 50 cm collectors , 6 m separation [ baseline ] ) , a guide interferometer ( 30 cm collectors , 4 @.@ 2 m baseline ) , and a guide telescope ( 30 cm aperture ) . The sophisticated guide telescope stabilizes instrument pointing in the third dimension . The spacecraft 's operational limiting magnitude goes down to 20 at 20 millionths of an arcsecond ( <unk> ) and its planet @-@ finding , astrometric accuracy of 1 @.@ 12 <unk> is for single measurements . The accuracy of its global , all @-@ sky astrometric grid is 4 <unk> . 
 SIM 's design since 2000 consists of two light collectors ( strictly speaking , they are Mersenne telescopes ) mounted on opposite ends of a six @-@ meter structure . The observatory will be able to measure the small wobbles in stars and detect the planets causing them down to one Earth mass at distances up to 33 light years ( 10 parsecs ) from the Sun . 
 = Sukhoi Su @-@ 37 = 
 The Sukhoi Su @-@ 37 ( NATO reporting name : Flanker @-@ F ) is an experimental single @-@ seat , <unk> multirole jet fighter , designed by Sukhoi . A further development of the original Su @-@ 27 " Flanker " , it was modified from the first @-@ generation Su @-@ 35 ( formerly " T10M " ) prototypes . The Su @-@ 37 features an upgraded <unk> suite and fire @-@ control system , but its most notable additions are the thrust vectoring nozzles . Only two prototypes were converted . 
 During the Su @-@ 35 flight test programme , active controls during dogfighting maneuvers could not be attained ; thus Sukhoi explored the application of thrust @-@ vectoring nozzles to give fighters better dogfighting attributes . The first Su @-@ 37 , converted from the eleventh Su @-@ 35 , made its maiden flight in April 1996 at Zhukovsky . It was joined by a second prototype in 1998 . Throughout the program , the Su @-@ 37 publicly demonstrated its attributes at numerous air shows , performing maneuvers impossible to complete with normal flight control methods , among which was a 360 ° somersault . Despite its potential advantages , the Su @-@ 37 did not enter production ; it has instead remained as a technology demonstrator for updated Su @-@ 27 family aircraft such as the export Su @-@ 30 and the modernized Su @-@ 35 . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 The earliest records on thrust vectoring technology research within Sukhoi began in 1983 . The design bureau studied two @-@ dimensional ( 2D ) vector nozzle , which was believed by the West to be the best way of controlling thrust . Sukhoi modified an Su @-@ <unk> @-@ PS twin @-@ seater with a 2D nozzle to verify the feasibility of this kind of nozzle . However , the design bureau 's General Designer , Mikhail Simonov , believed asymmetrical nozzles ( 3D ) to be more suitable . At the request of Sukhoi , experiments on both types of nozzles were carried out by the Siberian Aeronautical Research Institute ( <unk> ) . 
 Meanwhile , Sukhoi was busy with the T10M ( later renamed Su @-@ 35 in 1993 ) program , which was a comprehensive upgrade over the Su @-@ 27 . The T10M would incorporate aerodynamic modifications , improved avionics and armament , and have a better propulsion system , designed to give it greatly enhanced agility . The first Su @-@ 27M prototype ( T @-@ 10S @-@ 70 ) made its maiden flight on 28 June 1988 . Changes from the Su @-@ 27 include canards , upgraded engines , new radar , and a digital fly @-@ by @-@ wire flight @-@ control system . Later Su @-@ 35 prototypes featured glass cockpits and modified vertical stabilizers . The Su @-@ 35 's construction made significant use of composites , including aluminium @-@ lithium ( Al @-@ Li ) alloy . The aircraft , like the Su @-@ 27 , could perform the previously unattainable " Pugachev 's Cobra " and tailslide , but during these low @-@ speed maneuvers , active controls could not be achieved because the flight control surfaces were ineffective . 
 In 1995 , the eleventh T10M prototype , T10M @-@ 11 , was delivered to Sukhoi 's experimental workshop to be outfitted with exclusive systems . Built by KnAAPO , its structure has increased carbon @-@ fibre and Al @-@ Li content . Installed was the 2D thrust @-@ vectoring Lyulka AL @-@ 31FP , an interim measure pending the availability of the AL @-@ 37FU ( <unk> <unk> , " afterburner @-@ controlled " ) . The 3D thrust @-@ vectoring Lyulka AL @-@ 37FU was still in development . The Al @-@ 31FP , in fact , is a hybrid version combining the Al @-@ 31F and the vectoring nozzle of the Al @-@ 37FU . Being fitted with a 2D vector nozzle , the Al @-@ 31FP is only variable in pitch , plus or minus 15 ° . The engine not only incorporates a new @-@ generation 2D TVC nozzle but also is resistant to engine surge even during inverted and flat spins , giving better reliability and maneuverability even when the angle of attack is 180 ° . 
 The fire @-@ control system was also improved . An upgraded N @-@ <unk> BARS Passive electronically scanned array radar was fitted . It can capable of tracking 15 aerial targets and guiding four air @-@ to @-@ air missiles . In the aircraft 's tail sting is an N @-@ 012 rearward facing radar , which has a 120 ° view horizontally and in elevation . The Su @-@ 37 also features an upgraded electronic warfare support measures package . It can carry air @-@ to @-@ air and air @-@ to @-@ surface weapons on 12 hardpoints . The vast range of weapons , of which the Su @-@ 37 can carry 8 @,@ 000 kg ( 17 @,@ 600 lb ) , is supplemented by the 150 @-@ round 30 mm GSh @-@ 301 cannon . 
 Instead of traditional analogue instruments , the cockpit has four T @-@ form <unk> <unk> ( Thales ) LCD multi @-@ function displays ( MFD ) . These display air data / navigation , systems status , weapons / systems selection and tactical situation information . The pilot , who is provided with a head @-@ up display ( HUD ) , sits on the K @-@ <unk> ejection seat inclined 30 ° to help counter the effects of high g @-@ forces . The pilot steers with a side @-@ stick and pressure @-@ sensing throttles . The two @-@ grip flying control configuration was designed to prevent the pilot from losing contact with the controls when the aircraft is engaged in fast vectored @-@ thrust maneuvers . Both the fixed throttle and the side @-@ stick controller provide secure points for the pilot to brace his hands . 
 Painted in a disruptive sand and brown scheme , the aircraft was given the code 711 Blue , later changed to 711 White . Its maiden flight occurred at Zhukovsky on 2 April 1996 , with Yevgeni Frolov at the controls . The nozzle was locked fully aft throughout the flight , and it was not until the sixth flight that tests on the thrust @-@ vector nozzles commenced . Frolov was joined by Igor <unk> , and for the next twelve days , the two had amassed twelve flights between them . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 The 711 Blue was demonstrated to the press at Zhukovsky in spring 1996 , by which time it was re @-@ designated Su @-@ 37 . Its debut to the general public came in September that year at the Farnborough Airshow , piloted by Sukhoi test pilot Yevgeni Frolov . A big talking point of the show was its performance of the " Super Cobra " , when the aircraft pitched up to 180 ° , literally flying tail first , albeit for only a few seconds ; this maneuver evolved into the 360 ° " Frolov Chakra " somersault . The following year , the aircraft arrived on the fifth and last day of the Paris Air Show to perform five aerial displays , the fourth of which was marred by a minor incident when the emergency undercarriage extension handle was moved , preventing gear retraction . It appeared at that year 's Moscow International Aviation and Space Show and Dubai International Defence Exhibition , as well as the 1998 <unk> air show in Chile ; for the latter two the Su @-@ 37 appeared under the enigmatic designation , " Su @-@ <unk> " . 
 In 1998 , there was a report about a second Su @-@ 37 ( T10M @-@ 12 ) which was similarly converted before making its first flight on 23 March the same year . But this aircraft , <unk> , was never converted to the Su @-@ 37 specifications ; it was used in <unk> for weapon and radar tests . Later , the <unk> ( with the <unk> and all three serial produced planes , bort No. 86 , 87 , and 88 ) added to the <unk> <unk> demo team , repainted . Flight tests and demonstrations at air shows continued until 2000 . In 2001 , 711 was outfitted with AL @-@ 37FU engines and updated fly @-@ by @-@ wire flight control system and avionics . In December 2002 , 711 crashed during a ferry flight , effectively bringing an end to the program ; the fault was later traced to structurally damaged right horizontal stabilizer , caused by the extensive load during high g post @-@ stall tight turns . The Su @-@ 37 did not reach the production stage , although by mid @-@ 2000 , Sukhoi introduced several modernizations of the Su @-@ 27 , such as Su @-@ 30MKI and second generation Su @-@ 35 , which feature similar improvements such as improved avionics and radar systems , and thrust vectoring engines .

 = Control ( Janet Jackson album ) = 
 Control is the third studio album by American recording artist Janet Jackson , released on February 4 , 1986 , by A & M Records . Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound : a fusion of rhythm and blues , rap vocals , funk , disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson , Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R & B. The album became Jackson 's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market , with Control becoming one of the foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music . 
 Containing autobiographical themes , a majority of the album 's lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life : a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge , severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family , hiring the A & M executive John McClain as her new management , and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis . The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self @-@ actualization . It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers , particularly black women . 
 Following its release , Control became Jackson 's first record to top the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and five of its commercial singles — " What Have You Done for Me Lately " , " Nasty " , " Control " , " When I Think of You " , and " Let 's Wait Awhile " — peaked within the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart . Music videos created to promote the singles showcased her dancing ability and became a catalyst for MTV 's evolving demographics . The album went on to receive several accolades , including a nomination for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and winning Producer of the Year , Non @-@ Classical for Jam and Lewis in 1987 . It is listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time , in addition to being included in several publications " best of " album lists . It has been certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and has sold more than fourteen million copies worldwide . 
 = = Background = = 
 Joseph Jackson , patriarch of the Jackson family of musicians , was known for managing the careers of all nine of his children ; most notably , the successful career of The Jackson 5 . After arranging a recording contract with A & M in 1982 for a then sixteen @-@ year @-@ old Janet , he oversaw the entire production of her debut album , Janet Jackson , and its follow @-@ up , Dream Street ( 1984 ) ; the latter of which was written and produced by her brothers Marlon and Michael , and Jesse Johnson . Best known as a television actress , she was initially reluctant to begin a recording career . She said , " I was coming off of a TV show that I absolutely hated doing , Fame . I didn 't want to do [ the first record , Janet Jackson ] . I wanted to go to college . But I did it for my father ... " and elaborated that she was often in conflict with her producers . Amidst her professional struggles , she rebelled against her family 's wishes by marrying James DeBarge of the family recording group DeBarge in 1984 . The Jacksons disapproved of the relationship , citing DeBarge 's immaturity and substance abuse . Jackson left her husband in January 1985 and was granted an annulment later that year . 
 Jackson subsequently fired her father as her manager and employed John McClain , then A & M Records ' senior vice president of artists and repertoire and general manager . Commenting on the decision , she stated , " I just wanted to get out of the house , get out from under my father , which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do , telling him that I didn 't want to work with him again . " Joseph Jackson resented John McClain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter 's career out from under him , stating , " I 've worked hard for my family . The problem comes , though , when others come in behind you and try to steal them away . The wheels have already been set for Janet Jackson . Anyone who jumps on now will be getting a free ride . " McClain responded by saying " I 'm not trying to pimp Janet Jackson or steal her away from her father . " He subsequently introduced her to the songwriting / production duo of James " Jimmy Jam " Harris III and Terry Lewis , former Prince associates and ex @-@ members of The Time . 
 = = Composition and production = = 
 When Jam and Lewis agreed to produce Jackson 's third studio album , they wanted to appeal primarily to the African American community , in addition to achieving crossover success on the pop music charts . Jam commented in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine , " We wanted to do an album that would be in every black home in America ... we were going for the black album of all time . " Before their association with Jackson , Jam and Lewis had originally planned to record an album with tracks they wrote for Sharon Bryant , but she found their lyrics and sound to be too " rambunctious " . The duo presented the same set of recordings to Jackson , who gave her input and took co @-@ writing and co @-@ production credits for the album 's content . Jam and Lewis recalled that in order to collaborate with Jackson on the material , they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client . Lewis explained , " We got into her head . We saw what she was capable of , what she wanted to say , where she wanted to be , what she wanted to be . We put together some songs to fit her as we saw her , as she revealed herself to us . It was as simple as that . " 
 For the song " What Have You Done for Me Lately " , which was originally penned for one of Jam and Lewis 's own records , the lyrics were rewritten to convey Jackson 's feelings about her recent annulment from James DeBarge . The song was chosen as the lead single for Control , as Jam and Lewis felt it best represented Jackson 's outlook on life . " Nasty " , which in Jackson 's opinion was the most innovative song on the album , was inspired by one of her experiences in Minneapolis when a group of men made crude advances towards her outside the hotel she resided at during the recording of Control . She recalled , " They were emotionally abusive . Sexually threatening . Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection , I took a stand . I backed them down . That 's how songs like ' Nasty ' and ' What Have You Done for Me Lately ' were born , out of a sense of self @-@ defense . " Jimmy Jam wrote and played the keyboard arrangement , with Jackson playing the accompaniment . Background vocals were sung by Jackson , Jam and Lewis . The distinctive triplet swing beat of the song was developed by Jam on an Ensoniq Mirage keyboard . " Let 's Wait Awhile " was centered on safe sex and abstinence , a subject of significant social commentary at the time . Jam commented that it is common practice for songwriters to use current events as a means of inspiration for lyrics and that the AIDS pandemic had raised awareness about sexually transmitted diseases . He commented , " The theme of the song ( ' Let 's Wait Awhile ' ) was Janet 's idea . She 's not a preachy person . She 's not telling people how to live their lives . All she 's doing is offering an opinion . " 
 Although Joseph Jackson initially demanded that his daughter 's new album be recorded in Los Angeles so that he could keep an eye out for her , Jam and Lewis refused . They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis , Minnesota , " far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager @-@ fathers . " Jam stated , " We required that they put her in our hands . We had to do it on our turf , with no bodyguards , no star trips and none of Joe Jackson 's people hanging around making suggestions . " Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios , the site for Flyte Tyme Records , founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis . " There 's a little radiator I used to sit on when we did the Control album , " Jackson recalled in 1993 . John McClain served as the executive producer . 
 Jam and Lewis were the primary instrumentalists for the recording , including percussion , piano , drums , and also provided background vocals . Jackson accompanied Jam and Lewis on keyboard and took part in composing the arrangements . Stephen Holden of The New York Times observed the album was prominent example of the developing relationship with musicians and modern technology , stating " ... technology has altered the form , shape , scale and even the meaning of popular music ... The album wasn 't created by a studio band , as were most pop @-@ rock albums in the 1960s and ' 70s , but by the producers and the singer programming mechanized drum and keyboard textures . " Jackson 's father disapproved of the new material and image of Control , claiming it would never sell . In a cover story for Spin magazine titled " Damn It , Janet : The Battle for Control of Janet Jackson , " Joseph was reported saying " [ i ] f Janet listens to me , she 'll be as big as Michael . " She and McClain disregarded his objections . Commenting on the final product , Jackson stated : " It 's aggressive , cocky , very forward . It expresses exactly who I am and how I feel . I 've taken control of my own life . This time I 'm gonna do it my way . " 
 = = Release and promotion = = 
 Although A & M did not consider a full concert tour to promote Jackson 's album , the label funded a three @-@ week promotional tour across the United States in 13 cities following its release . In addition to the studio release , a remix album , Control : The Remixes , was released in select countries in November , 1987 . Jackson 's lyrical expression has been noted as one of the key elements of the album 's success . Author Dave Marsh in The Heart of Rock & Soul : The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made ( 1999 ) comments : " Certainly , Janet must have written her own lyrics , which went after men — in particular , not very well disguised stand @-@ ins for her father and former husband — more <unk> than another guy would have dared . Control , the resulting album , was one of the best @-@ sellers of 1986 – 1987 , producing five hit singles . " 
 Jesus Garber , then @-@ director of A & M 's black music marketing and promotion , noted that in addition to crossover promotion from black to pop music charts , music video was utilized to launch Jackson into super stardom . Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine credits the release of Control as " the birth of Janet the music video star , as six of the nine tracks were turned into popular videos that all but announced her as queen of the production dance number . " Henderson commented that Jackson 's dancing ability , trained by a then @-@ unknown Paula Abdul , only served to propel her into further stardom . Charlie Minor , then @-@ senior vice president of promotion for A & M stated : " The images completed the image of Janet Jackson with the buyer ... They gave her a face , dance , action identity with the songs , and a visual image of her as a rock ' n ' roll star . " Jonathan Cohen of Billboard magazine commented " [ Jackson 's ] accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV , and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader , beat @-@ driven musical mix . " The video for " Nasty " received three nominations for the fifth annual 1987 MTV Video Music Awards , winning Best Choreography for Paula Abdul .

 Control debuted at number 102 on the Billboard 200 and Top R & B Albums Chart on February 22 , 1986 , after twenty weeks on the chart it topped the Billboard 200 and the Top R & B / Black Albums chart . The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) first certified Control gold in April , 1986 , denoting 500 @,@ 000 units shipped within the United States . Two months later , in June , 1986 , the album was RIAA certified platinum , denoting 1 million units shipped . Three years later , Control was RIAA certified fivefold platinum in October , 1989 . Since its debut , Control has sold over fourteen million copies worldwide . 
 The album 's lead single , " What Have You Done for Me Lately " , peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and at number one on the Hot Black Singles chart . The single was certified gold by the RIAA in November , 1990 . The song was compared favorably to similar recordings of female empowerment released by black women , such as " New Attitude " by Patti LaBelle , " Better Be Good to Me " by Tina Turner and " Sisters Are Doin ' It for Themselves " by Aretha Franklin . Oprah Winfrey commented : " What you 're seeing in all the areas of arts and entertainment is black women internalizing the idea of black power and pride ... Black women started listening to their inner cues , rather than society or even the black community 's idea of what they are supposed to be and can be . " " Nasty " , the album 's second single , beat " What Have You Done for Me Lately " by one position , peaking at number three on the Hot 100 and at number one on the Hot Black Singles chart . It was certified gold in November , 1990 . Critic Jon Bream noted " the songwriters have slyly juxtaposed a nasty @-@ sounding groove and the repetition of the word ' nasty ' with a subtle <unk> message . " 
 " When I Think of You " reached number one on the Hot 100 , becoming Jackson 's first single to top the chart , and was certified gold in November , 1990 . The album 's fourth single and title track , " Control " , reached its peak position at number five on the Hot 100 and at number one on the Hot Black Singles chart , later certified gold by the RIAA in November , 1990 . " Let 's Wait Awhile " reached the number two position on the Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Black Singles chart . Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune commented in a similar vein to " Nasty " , the ballad " throw [ s ] cold water on the passions of young love ' before we go too far ' . " Unlike its predecessors , " The Pleasure Principle " did not reach within the top five of the Hot 100 , instead peaking at number fourteen . It did , however , become Jackson 's fifth number one single on the Hot Black Singles chart . Each of the album 's singles excluding " Let 's Wait Awhile " peaked within the top five of the Billboard Club Play Singles . " Funny How Time Flies ( When You 're Having Fun ) " was not released as a commercial single in the United States . Abroad , it peaked at number 59 on the UK Singles Chart .

 Upon its release , the album garnered general acclaim from critics . Rolling Stone 's Rob Hoerburger commented that the " sharp @-@ tongued " Janet Jackson is " more concerned with identity than with playlists " , as Control declares she is no longer the Jacksons ' baby sister . Hoerburger expressed the view that that tracks such as " Nasty " and " What Have You Done for Me Lately " erased the former " pop @-@ ingénue image " of Jackson 's first two albums , and that " Control is a better album than Diana Ross has made in five years and puts Janet in a position similar to the young Donna Summer 's — unwilling to accept novelty status and taking her own steps to rise above it . " Steven Ivory of Billboard expressed " [ v ] <unk> , Jackson is more aggressive than ever . Indeed , her exhibition of sass and funkiness is certainly more provocative " in comparison to her previous work . NME wrote : " Jackson has gone a long way in shaking off the experience of being a shadow Jackson child . She is an artist in her own right . " Newsweek stated " [ i ] n an era of big @-@ voiced pop @-@ soul divas ... her current hit album , is taut , funky , hard as nails , an alternative to the sentimental balladry and opulent arrangements of Patti LaBelle and Whitney Houston . " Robert Christgau " scoffed at Janet 's claims of autonomy " , but gave the album a B rating based on " its entertainment value " . Los Angeles Times critic Connie Johnson wrote : " Though still a teen @-@ ager , this singer 's stance is remarkably nervy and mature . She has a snotty sort of assurance that permeates several cuts , plus the musical muscle to back it up . " Jon Pareles of The New York Times notes Control takes obvious influence from Prince , describing " [ t ] he album 's pacing , its clipped vocal lines — even the spoken introduction that starts things off " as pure Minneapolis sound ; he adds " [ b ] ut where the Prince style is usually connected with heavy @-@ breathing come @-@ ons , Miss Jackson is cheerfully standoffish . " 
 For the 29th Annual Grammy Awards , Control received four nominations : Album of the Year , Best R & B Song for " What Have You Done for Me Lately " , Best Female R & B Vocal Performance and Non @-@ Classical Producer of the Year for Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis . Jam and Lewis won Producer of the Year . The album earned a record @-@ breaking twelve nominations from the American Music Awards , winning four . Jackson also won three Soul Train Music Awards and six Billboard Music Awards . 
 Later reviews continue to find the album favorable . Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine expressed that the misconception that Control is Jackson 's debut album only confirmed the " quintessential statement on personal and artistic self @-@ actualization " that it set out to accomplish . Henderson claimed critics who judged Jackson harshly for her thin voice " somehow missed the explosive ' gimme a beat ' vocal pyrotechnics she unleashes all over " Nasty " ... Or that they completely dismissed how perfect her tremulous hesitance fits into the abstinence anthem " Let 's Wait Awhile . " However , Henderson also commented that the " Jam @-@ Lewis formula wasn 't completely infallible " as " You Can Be Mine " and " Funny How Time Flies ( When You 're Having Fun ) " , were two of the album 's least impressive misfires . While William Ruhlmann of Allmusic commented Jackson " came across as an aggressive , independent woman " , he asserts the album 's true value is the production talents of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis . The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album four stars out of five .

 Control is widely considered to be the breakthrough in Jackson 's career , establishing her independence and dominance in the realm of popular music . In The Sex Revolts : Gender , Rebellion , and Rock 'n'roll ( 1996 ) author Simon Reynolds wrote that " Janet Jackson became a superstar with the immaculately designed soft @-@ core feminism of Control . " Jet magazine commented that although the Jackson family 's musical legacy had given her an opportunity to tap into an international audience , Control was the turning point at which " her career took off and she became a bona fide superstar . Control showcased Janet as a person who was firmly and finally in control of her own life . " Dennis Hunt of the Los Angeles Times wrote : " Previously , she had recorded two unsophisticated , kiddie soul albums . If you listened carefully to that kid stuff , there was a grown @-@ up singer there somewhere struggling to get out . [ Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis ] liberated the real Janet Jackson . " 
 Lyrically , Jackson 's album is said to exhibit a " politically driven feminist " message , as stated by Lilly Goren in You 've Come A Long Way , Baby : Women , Politics , and Popular Culture ( 2009 ) . Musically , according to Rickey Vincent , author of Funk : The Music , The People , and The Rhythm of The One ( 1996 ) , Jam and Lewis 's collaboration with her is said to be one of the high points of the 1980s , as they redefined dance music by mixing a youthful sound with industrial @-@ strength beats . As documented by musicologist Richard J. Ripani , author of The New Blue Music : Changes in Rhythm & Blues , 1950 – 1999 ( 2006 ) , Control is regarded as one of the most influential albums in the history of rhythm and blues and the first album to bridge the gap between R & B and rap music . Its success in both the mainstream R & B and pop music charts " led to the incorporation of many of the stylistic traits of rap over the next few years , and Janet Jackson was to continue to be one of the leaders in that development . " Furthermore , the album 's second single " Nasty " has been credited with influencing the new jack swing genre , pioneered by Teddy Riley . The New Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) wrote that the album impacted popular music with a " blockbuster momentum all its own " , while Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine noted Control " was every bit the hit machine that her brother 's Thriller was . " Steve Morse of The Boston Globe commented : " All things considered , 1986 was a stellar year for the black female vocalist — the best , in fact , since the disco era of a decade back ... Black music crossed over to the pop charts in dramatic fashion , with Whitney Houston , Patti LaBelle and Janet Jackson each having No. 1 albums . " 
 In addition to stepping out of the Jackson family shadow , Control established Jackson as one of the preeminent female artists of popular music , rivaling fellow pop star Madonna , as critics began to acknowledge their influence on the record industry and younger artists . Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8 : Genres : North America ( 2012 ) documents that both women redefined house music , repackaging it " as part of a global metropolitan pop aesthetic . " With regard to marketing singles , Paul Grein of Billboard reported : " 10 or 20 years ago you would have had two singles from an album at the most . Now we 're in an era where Madonna is on her fifth single from the album True Blue and Janet Jackson is on her sixth from the LP Control . " Jackson subsequently became the first female artist to produce six top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 from a single album . Los Angeles Times writer Paul Grein wrote a segment titled " The influence of Madonna and Janet Jackson " , reporting Debbie Gibson 's manager Doug Breitbart claimed " Madonna has brought back a really strong , melodic component to pop music " , while Teen Beat editor Maggie Murphy remarked " Janet Jackson may have started this more than anyone else . " Anthony DeCurtis , author of Present Tense : Rock & Roll and Culture ( 1992 ) wrote that " Madonna and Janet Jackson have produced videos that explore the female gaze , " and described Jackson 's music video for " Nasty " as feminist theory on film that deconstructs the objectification of women . 
 The New Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) documented that within two years of the release of Control , " a new crop of female singers ( such as Paula Abdul and Karyn White ) were charged with imitating Janet . " Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone remarked : " Control — with its quintuple @-@ platinum sales and string of hit singles — established " a then @-@ twenty @-@ year @-@ old Jackson " as one of the most popular recording artists in the world . " Control has been honored by several music publication in recognition of its impact on the recording industry , including " Rolling Stone 's 100 Best Albums of the Eighties " , Q magazine 's " 100 Women Who Rock The World " , Slant Magazine 's " Vital Pop : 50 Essential Pop Albums " , and " Best Albums of the ' 80s " Vibe magazine 's " 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century " and " The <unk> 51 " , and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 's " The Definitive 200 : Top 200 Albums of All @-@ Time " . The Guardian described the album 's release as one of the 50 key events in the history of R & B and hip hop . Upon the 30th anniversary of the album 's release , Julian Kimble of Billboard magazine wrote : " In hindsight , Control is both evolutionary and revolutionary . As Jackson ’ s first album to land atop the Billboard 200 , it marked professional and personal breakthroughs . Distancing herself from the immense Jackson family shadow , she created one of the most influential projects across contemporary R & B and pop music . And not only was Jackson ’ s maiden voyage with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis at the forefront of R & B , pop and hip @-@ hop ’ s intersection , it birthed a novel sound in the process . " MTV 's Meaghan Garvey asserted " it ’ s hard to overstate the significance of Control , whether in terms of the pop landscape , the evolution of the music video as a vessel for promotion and expression , or Top 40 feminist anthems . " She also argued " it ’ s important to note that Control ’ s self @-@ actualization anthems were expressions of black female pride . Control spawned a whopping six videos — great ones , at that — which played an immeasurable role in the shift toward visible black pop . " Gerrick D. Kennedy of Los Angeles Times wrote that Jackson 's continued influence is evident in the careers of Rihanna , Beyonce , Ciara , <unk> Twigs and Tinashe in that " all of them take cues from Jackson 's blueprint . And all that began with ' Control ' . "

 = Hello , Goodbye = 
 " Hello , Goodbye " is a song by the English rock band the Beatles , written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon – McCartney . Backed by John Lennon 's " I Am the Walrus " , it was issued as a non @-@ album single in November 1967 , the group 's first release since the death of their manager , Brian Epstein . The single was commercially successful around the world , topping charts in the United States , the United Kingdom , Canada , Australia and several other countries . 
 McCartney later said that the lyrics take duality as their theme . The song originated when , in response to a question from Beatles aide Alistair Taylor about songwriting , McCartney sat down at a harmonium and asked Taylor to say the opposite of whatever he said . The completed song includes a musical coda , which was improvised by the Beatles when they were recording the track in October 1967 . Unimpressed with the composition , Lennon pushed for " I Am the Walrus " to be the single 's A @-@ side , but McCartney and the band 's producer , George Martin , opted for the more commercial @-@ sounding " Hello , Goodbye " . The Beatles produced three promotional films for the song , one of which was shown on The Ed Sullivan Show in America . Due to regulations against lip @-@ syncing in Britain , none of the clips were aired there . 
 " Hello , Goodbye " has traditionally received a varied response from music critics . While some reviewers praise the song for its classic pop qualities , others deem it unadventurous by the Beatles ' standards and inconsequential . The track was included on the expanded US release of the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack EP , and later appeared on compilation albums such as 1967 – 1970 and 1 . McCartney has often performed " Hello , Goodbye " in concert , beginning with his Driving World Tour in 2002 . James Last , Bud Shank , Allen Toussaint , the Cure and the cast of Glee are among the acts who have also recorded the song . 
 = = Background = = 
 Although the songwriting credit is Lennon – McCartney , " Hello , Goodbye " was written solely by Paul McCartney . The composition came about through an exercise in word association between McCartney and Alistair Taylor , an assistant of the Beatles ' manager , Brian Epstein . It originated during a period when , following the completion of their album Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band in April 1967 , the Beatles typically embraced randomness and simplicity as part of the creative process . 
 According to Taylor 's recollection , he was visiting McCartney at his home in St John 's Wood , London , and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song . In response , McCartney took Taylor into the dining room , where they both sat at a harmonium ; McCartney then began playing the instrument and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing . Author Steve Turner writes of the result : " And so it went – black and white , yes and no , stop and go , hello and goodbye . " Taylor later reflected : " I 've no memory at all of the tune ... I wonder whether Paul really made up [ the melody to ] that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already . " 
 Talking in the 1990s to his official biographer , Barry Miles , McCartney said that the lyrics address duality , reflecting his astrological sign of Gemini . He added : " It 's such a deep theme in the universe , duality – man woman , black white , ebony ivory , high low , right wrong , up down , hello goodbye – that it was a very easy song to write . " McCartney also said that , in " Hello , Goodbye " , he was promoting " the more positive side of the duality " . 
 Among Beatles biographers , Ian MacDonald dates the composition to late September 1967 , while Bob Spitz says it was written in time for the Our World international television broadcast , in June that year . According to Spitz , McCartney suggested " Hello , Goodbye " as the Beatles ' contribution to Our World , an honour that instead went to the John Lennon @-@ composed " All You Need Is Love " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Hello Goodbye " is in the key of C major and in 4 / 4 time . MacDonald describes the musical structure as " characteristically scalar " and founded on " a descending sequence in C " , with " a brief touchdown on A flat as its only surprise " . Musicologist Walter Everett writes that the bassline in the chorus is an inverted form of the descending scale , which is accentuated on the Beatles ' recording by the lead guitar part . 
 In Everett 's estimation , much of " Hello , Goodbye " references previous Lennon – McCartney compositions : over the verses , the parallel thirds in the vocal recall the band 's unreleased song " Love of the Loved " , among others ; melodically , the chorus is similar to the keyboard part on " For No One " ; and the complementary vocal parts in the final verse recall " Help ! " Everett also suggests that , early in " Hello , Goodbye " , McCartney appears to be imitating the V – VI chord " ambivalence " of " Strawberry Fields Forever " . Everett describes the composition as " derivative McCartney " , for the most part , " freshened up " primarily through the use of phrase lengths that deviate from a standard eight bars . 
 Consistent with the song title , the lyrics comprise a series of antonyms – such as yes – no , black – white and stay – go . With the narrative perspective alternating between first and second person , the composition also recalls George and Ira Gershwin 's " Let 's Call the Whole Thing Off " . 
 Following the third chorus , at 2 : 36 on the released recording , the bassline descends chromatically to mark the start of what musicologist Alan Pollack terms the " first outro " and Everett calls a " <unk> " . After this false ending , the song returns with a 45 @-@ second coda , which MacDonald identifies as a " Maori finale – a mistake for ' Hawaiian ' ( <unk> ) " . The coda consists of a repeated musical phrase over a pedal point in C major , accompanied by the vocal refrain " <unk> @-@ hello @-@ a " . 
 = = Recording = = 
 The Beatles began recording " Hello , Goodbye " at EMI 's Abbey Road Studios in October 1967 , towards the end of filming for their Magical Mystery Tour television special . The latter was a film project that McCartney had championed , in an effort to focus the group in the wake of Epstein 's death that August . Under the working title " Hello Hello " , the Beatles taped the basic track for the song on 2 October , with George Martin producing the session and Geoff Emerick and Ken Scott as engineers . The line @-@ up on the take selected for overdubs , take 14 , was McCartney on piano , Lennon on Hammond organ , George Harrison on maracas , and Ringo Starr on drums . 
 The band members then added tambourine , conga drum and bongos over the coda . This last section of the song came about while the group were working in the studio . Lennon , who was otherwise highly critical of " Hello , Goodbye " , approved of the addition , saying : " The best bit was the end , which we all ad @-@ libbed in the studio , where I played the piano . Like one of my favourite bits on ' Ticket to Ride ' , where we just threw something in at the end . " In McCartney 's recollection , the coda " didn 't sound quite right " until Emerick increased the reverberation on the tom @-@ tom drums , at which point , " it just came alive . " 
 The Beatles returned to the song on 19 October , two days after attending a memorial service for Epstein at the New London Synagogue on Abbey Road . At this session , Harrison added his lead guitar parts ( treated with Leslie effect ) , McCartney recorded the lead vocal , and Lennon , McCartney and Harrison supplied backing vocals ; handclaps were also overdubbed . With two reduction mixes having been carried out since 2 October , to free up space on the four @-@ track tape for these and later overdubs , the master take was now nominally take 16 . This version of the song appeared on the 1996 outtakes compilation Anthology 2 . In his book The Unreleased Beatles , Richie Unterberger writes that take 16 features a more " active " guitar line from Harrison , who answers McCartney 's vocal phrasing over the opening verse with a series of descending fills . Also present on this version is a short guitar solo , which would be replaced on the official release by what Unterberger terms " some inspired Paul scat @-@ tinged singing " . Unterberger speculates that the removal of these guitar parts may have caused tension between McCartney and Harrison , anticipating the pair 's disagreements regarding the lead guitarist 's role on McCartney compositions such as " Hey Jude " and " Two of Us " over 1968 – 69 . 
 Two violas were added to " Hello , Goodbye " at Abbey Road on 20 October . These string parts were played by classical musicians Kenneth Essex and Leo <unk> , and scored by Martin , who based the arrangement on a melody McCartney supplied on piano . McCartney overdubbed bass guitar on 25 October and , following a trip to Nice in France to film his " Fool on the Hill " segment for Magical Mystery Tour , added further bass to the track on 2 November . A mono mix of " Hello , Goodbye " was completed that same day , and the stereo version on 6 November . 
 = = Release = = 
 " Hello , Goodbye " was selected as the Beatles ' single for the 1967 Christmas season , their first release since Epstein 's death . A dismayed Lennon pushed for his composition " I Am the Walrus " to be the A @-@ side instead , but he was overruled by McCartney and George Martin , on the grounds that " Hello , Goodbye " was the more commercial of the two tracks . Lennon remained dismissive of the song ; he later said : " [ ' I Am the Walrus ' ] was the B side to ' Hello , Goodbye ' ! Can you believe it ? " Everett writes that , had " I Am the Walrus " been the A @-@ side , " [ it ] would probably have encouraged Lennon to lead the Beatles to new heights " , whereas the decision to choose " Hello , Goodbye " was " one more nail in the Beatles coffin " . 
 In Britain , Parlophone issued " Hello , Goodbye " backed by " I Am the Walrus " on 24 November 1967 , with the catalogue number R <unk> . Within a day of its release , the record had sold over 300 @,@ 000 copies there . It went on to top the UK 's official singles chart for seven weeks , through to 23 January 1968 , giving the Beatles their longest run at number 1 on that chart since " She Loves You " in 1963 . In the process , the song became the group 's fourth Christmas number 1 single in five years . For three weeks from 27 December 1967 , the band held the top two positions in the UK , with the Magical Mystery Tour soundtrack EP trailing " Hello , Goodbye " . 
 The single was released on 27 November in the United States , as Capitol 2056 . It peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks and became the band 's fifteenth American chart @-@ topper . The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 15 December 1967 . It was later listed by Billboard magazine as the band 's seventh biggest US chart hit . The single was successful in many other countries , topping charts in Australia , Canada , West Germany , Holland and Norway . It also peaked at number 2 in Ireland , Austria , Belgium and Switzerland . 
 " Hello , Goodbye " was included on the American Magical Mystery Tour album , which Capitol Records compiled by adding five non @-@ album singles tracks from 1967 to the six songs on the British double EP . In the Magical Mystery Tour film , which aired on British television on 26 December 1967 , the song 's coda plays over the end credits . " Hello , Goodbye " subsequently appeared on Beatles compilation albums such as 1967 – 1970 and 1 . 
 = = Promotional films = = 
 The band made three promotional clips for " Hello , Goodbye " . Filmed on 10 November 1967 at the Saville Theatre in London , the clips were directed by McCartney . The first one shows the Beatles dressed in their Sgt. Pepper uniforms , apart from a brief cut @-@ away where the group are wearing their 1963 @-@ era matching collarless suits . In author John Winn 's description of the three clips , this version shows the Beatles performing the song against a psychedelic backdrop , while over the coda they are joined on the stage by female hula dancers . Starr is seen playing a miniature drum kit and , unusually , Lennon appears without his granny glasses . In the second clip , the Beatles mime to the song dressed in more conventional attire and with the stage backdrop depicting a rural setting . The third version combines footage shot during these two scenes with the band playing the song before what Winn terms a " glittery pastel backdrop " . 
 In the US , the first promo for " Hello , Goodbye " was premiered on The Ed Sullivan Show on 26 November . Author Mark Hertsgaard describes the film as " a slapdash affair featuring the hula dancers that was salvaged only by some ludicrously spastic dancing by Lennon " . Music critic Robert Christgau was also unimpressed ; speculating in the May 1968 issue of Esquire on the content of the Magical Mystery Tour film , which had yet to air in America , Christgau wrote : " But if Paul McCartney 's work on the film clip of ' Hello Goodbye ' is any indication , we would be wise not to hope for too much . " 
 In Britain , the Beatles ran foul of the Musicians Union 's recently imposed ban on miming on television . With the first clip scheduled to premier on the 23 November edition of Top of the Pops , George Martin mixed a version of the track without violas , since no musician was seen to be playing those instruments ; the Beatles then allowed the BBC to film them at work editing Magical Mystery Tour on 21 November , in the hope that this new footage would replace any sections that contravened the ban . Instead , Top of the Pops aired the song over scenes from the band 's 1964 film A Hard Day 's Night . For the 7 December edition of the same show , the BBC ran a clip comprising still photographs mixed with some of the editing @-@ suite film – a combination that served as the promo for " Hello , Goodbye " throughout the remainder of its UK chart run . 
 The clip included in the 1996 Beatles Anthology video release consists of the Beatles ' first Saville Theatre film , up until the song 's coda , which incorporates footage from all three of the original promo films . The first of the original promos was included in the Beatles ' 2015 video compilation 1 , and all three were included in the three @-@ disc versions of the compilation , titled 1 + . The BBC @-@ compiled clip appeared as a bonus feature on the 2012 DVD reissue of Magical Mystery Tour , under the title " Top of the Pops 1967 " . 
 In May 2013 , a Vox electric guitar used by Lennon during part of the filming for " Hello , Goodbye " sold for US $ 408 @,@ 000 at an auction in New York . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Writing in December 1967 , Richard Goldstein of The New York Times said that " Hello , Goodbye " " sounds like a B @-@ side " and described it as " interesting but subordinate " . In his single review for Melody Maker , Nick Jones wrote : " Superficially it 's a very ' ordinary ' Beatles record without cascading sitars , and the involved , weaving hallucinogenic sounds that we 've grown to love so much . However , all the Beatles soul and feeling is shining through ... " More impressed , Derek Johnson of the NME welcomed the simplicity of " Hello , Goodbye " , describing it as " Supremely commercial , and the answer to those who feel The Beatles are going too way out " . 
 In his book Revolution in the Head , Ian MacDonald views the track as " blandly catchy " and comments that its long stay at number 1 in Britain " says more about the sudden decline of the singles chart than the quality of the song itself " . Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone considers that , at this stage in their career , " the Beatles didn 't need to push – they could have hit # 1 with a tape of themselves blowing their noses " , which , he suggests , " would have been catchier " than both " Hello , Goodbye " and the band 's next single , " Lady Madonna " . Writing for Rough Guides , Chris Ingham describes " Hello , Goodbye " as a " harmless , facile word and chord @-@ play that kept the far more challenging ' Walrus ' from being the A @-@ side of the [ Beatles ' ] first post @-@ Epstein single " . Among other Beatles biographers , Andrew Hickey dismisses the song as a " mindless little nothing " that was " completely outclassed by its flipside " , while Peter Doggett labels it " commercial but rather inconsequential ... three minutes of contradictions and meaningless juxtapositions , with a tune that was impossible to forget " . 
 In a 2005 review of the Magical Mystery Tour album , Sputnikmusic lauded the song for " encapsulating everything that made the Beatles such a great pop band " , and praised its piano line , Starr 's drumming , and the coda . Writing for AllMusic , Richie Unterberger names " Hello , Goodbye " as one of the " huge , glorious , and innovative singles " on Magical Mystery Tour , while Billboard 's Chris Payne rates the track among the band 's " most perfect pop songs " . Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork Media cites it as an example of how McCartney " excelled at selling simplistic lyrics that risk seeming cloying " , although he adds : " the kaleidoscopic , carnival @-@ ride melody and interplay between lead and backing vocals ensure it 's a much better record than it is a song . " 
 In the NME 's 2015 list of the " 100 Greatest Beatles Songs " as selected by other musicians , " Hello , Goodbye " was chosen by the Cure and ranked 91st . Ultimate Classic Rock website places the track at number 45 on its list of the " Top 50 Beatles Songs " , while Rolling Stone ranks it last on the magazine 's " 100 Greatest Beatles Songs " list , with the editor remarking : " McCartney never claimed that the irresistibly bouncy ' Hello , Goodbye ' was his most profound songwriting moment . " In 2006 , the track appeared at number 36 in a similar list compiled by Mojo , accompanied by commentary from Alan McGee , who described it as " the greatest @-@ ever pop song , bar none " . " Hello , Goodbye " is ranked 76th by Stephen <unk> and Michael Lewis in their book 100 Best Beatles Songs , where the authors call it a " classic " and a " fine , fresh , fun piece of pop " .

 James Last , the Hollyridge Strings , Bud Shank and the Soulful Strings were all among the artists who covered " Hello , Goodbye " in the year following its release in 1967 . Allen Toussaint , with whom McCartney worked briefly on his and Wings ' 1975 album Venus and Mars , released a version of the song in 1989 . More recent covers include recordings by Dwight <unk> and the band Ash , and a novelty version by Looney Tunes characters credited to " Bugs & Friends " . 
 The cast of the US television show Glee released a recording of " Hello , Goodbye " as the opening track of their 2010 album Glee : The Music , Volume 3 Showstoppers . This version became a hit when issued as a single . In 2014 , the Cure recorded the song with McCartney 's son James , for inclusion on the multi @-@ artist compilation The Art of McCartney . 
 McCartney has performed " Hello , Goodbye " on many of his tours as a solo artist . These include 2002 's Driving World Tour and 2003 's Back in the World Tour , when he opened his concerts with the song , and the On the Run Tour in 2011 – 12 . In addition , throughout his 1989 – 90 world tour , McCartney segued the coda onto the end of " Put It There " .

 Petar Parchevich ( Bulgarian : Петър <unk> , pronounced [ <unk> <unk> ] ; Croatian : Petar <unk> ) or Petar <unk> <unk> ( Петър <unk> <unk> ) ( c . 1612 – 23 July 1674 ) was a Bulgarian Roman Catholic archbishop , diplomat , scholar , baron of Austria and one of the architects behind the anti @-@ Ottoman Chiprovtsi Uprising . 
 A native of Chiprovtsi and one of Bulgaria 's most educated people of the 17th century , Parchevich was among the leaders of the Bulgarian Roman Catholics . His numerous diplomatic visits to the royal courts of Europe were mostly in an attempt to garner support for an anti @-@ Ottoman uprising in Bulgaria , which he did not live to witness . Nevertheless , his efforts in defending Christianity earned him a noble title from the Austrian emperors , and he took up several important positions within the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy . 
 = = Education and early diplomacy = = 
 Petar Parchevich was born circa 1612 in Chiprovtsi to an influential Parchevich ( <unk> ) family , having Croatian roots and being the ancestral house of the House of Pejačević , a notable and distinguished Croatian noble family in the 18th and 19th century . Chiprovtsi was then a Catholic @-@ populated town in the northwestern Bulgarian lands under the rule of the Ottoman Empire . In the 17th century , Chiprovtsi was a rich merchant town in its cultural heyday . Like many Bulgarians from Chiprovtsi at the time , Parchevich was sent to be educated in Italy . Having studied in Rome and Loreto , he returned to Bulgaria in 1643 as a doctor of theology and canon law , which made him one of the most educated Bulgarians of his age . 
 Upon his return , Parchevich engaged in diplomacy with the ultimate goal of ensuring the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule . Receiving papal support , Parchevich visited the royal courts of Europe and advocated the formation of an anti @-@ Ottoman alliance which would drive out the Ottoman Turks from the Balkans . Parchevich was received by the courts of the Austrian Empire , the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , the Republic of Venice , the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia , and Pope Innocent X himself . There , he requested backing for an anti @-@ Ottoman campaign which would lead to the liberation of the Balkans , and " most of all , of the great Bulgarian Empire " . 
 Parchevich made several visits to Poland , such as once in 1647 , when he was met by Władysław IV Vasa , and once in late 1649 , when he was received by the new king John II Casimir Vasa . In his speech before the Senate of Venice from 1650 , Parchevich referred to the " unbearable Ottoman yoke " and told of the Bulgarian people 's long struggle against the Ottomans . After meeting with Innocent and persuading the pope that Bulgaria could collect an army of 20 @,@ 000 for an anti @-@ Ottoman campaign , Parchevich remained in Rome until the spring of 1651 . 
 = = Archbishop , major diplomat and baron = = 
 In 1658 , Parchevich was appointed head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marcianopolis ( named after an Ancient Roman city near modern <unk> , northeastern Bulgaria ) . Along with the Diocese of <unk> headed by Filip <unk> , Marcianopolis was one of the two sees which succeeded the Bulgarian Custody as the governing body of Catholicism in Bulgaria . Parchevich also held the position of Bulgarian <unk> to the Viennese court . In 1661 , Parchevich had to step down as Archbishop of Marcianopolis due to pressure from Rome , which condemned his clerical inactivity , though in 1668 he became apostolic vicar to Moldavia despite continuing suspicion . 
 By the mid @-@ 1650s , Parchevich had entered major European politics and was the central figure of a significant anti @-@ Ottoman plot . In 1656 , Parchevich arranged a meeting in Târgovişte between the members of the plot , which included the rulers of Moldavia and Wallachia and high @-@ ranking clerics , including the Serbian Patriarch . After the meeting , Parchevich sent revolutionary messages to Bulgaria , Serbia , Albania and Greece , hoping to incite a rebellion . His plans were backed by the rulers of the Romanian lands which border Bulgaria north of the Danube : Gheorghe Ştefan of Moldavia and Constantin Şerban of Wallachia . However , the lack of clear support by key accomplice Austria meant an eventual uprising had to be delayed . In 1657 , Parchevich was received by Cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky , whom he visited on a special mission . In the same year , he was granted the noble title of baron by the Habsburgs owing to his merits in defending Christianity . As an Austrian noble , he was styled Peter Freiherr von Parchevich . 
 In spite of Parchevich 's efforts , conditions would not be favourable to a Bulgarian anti @-@ Ottoman uprising until well after his death . While on a diplomatic mission to Pope Clement X , he died of illness in Rome in the summer of 1674 and was buried at the Sant 'Andrea delle <unk> basilica in the city . Parchevich 's letters and reports have been preserved and are an important source of information regarding his activities .

 Various institutions around Bulgaria have been named after Petar Parchevich , including streets in the capital Sofia and Shumen . A Catholic football club known as SK Parchevich was founded in Plovdiv in 1923 and later merged into what is today PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv . One of the neighbourhoods of the mostly Catholic @-@ populated town of Rakovski in Plovdiv Province is also known as Parchevich . In addition , three schools , in Plovdiv , Rakovski and Chiprovtsi , are named after him , as is a community centre ( chitalishte ) in the Banat Bulgarian village of <unk> , Pleven Province . Parchevich Ridge in the <unk> Heights on Greenwich Island of the South Shetland Islands , Antarctica , also bears his name thanks to the efforts of the Antarctic Place @-@ names Commission of Bulgaria . 
 = Rolls @-@ Royce R = 
 The Rolls @-@ Royce R was a British aero engine designed and built specifically for air racing purposes by Rolls @-@ Royce Limited . Nineteen R engines were assembled in a limited production run between 1929 and 1931 . Developed from the Rolls @-@ Royce Buzzard , it was a 37 @-@ litre ( 2 @,@ 240 cu in ) capacity , supercharged V @-@ 12 capable of producing just under 2 @,@ 800 horsepower ( 2 @,@ 090 kW ) , and weighed 1 @,@ 640 pounds ( 770 kg ) . Intensive factory testing revealed mechanical failures which were remedied by redesigning the components , greatly improving reliability . 
 The R was used with great success in the Schneider Trophy seaplane competitions held in England in 1929 and 1931 . Shortly after the 1931 competition , an R engine using a special fuel blend powered the winning Supermarine S.6B aircraft to a new airspeed record of over 400 miles per hour ( 640 km / h ) . Continuing through the 1930s , both new and used R engines were used to achieve various land and water speed records by such racing personalities as Sir Henry Segrave , Sir Malcolm Campbell and his son Donald , the last record being set in 1939 . A final R @-@ powered water speed record attempt by Donald Campbell in 1951 was unsuccessful . 
 The experience gained by Rolls @-@ Royce and Supermarine designers from the R engine was invaluable in the subsequent development of the Rolls @-@ Royce Merlin engine and the Spitfire . A de @-@ rated R engine , known as the Griffon , was tested in 1933 , but it was not directly related to the production Rolls @-@ Royce Griffon of 1939 , of the same exact bore / stroke and resultant displacement figures as the " R " design . Three examples of the R engine are on public display in British museums as of 2014 . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 = = = Origin = = = 
 Rolls @-@ Royce realised that the Napier Lion engine used in the 1927 Supermarine <unk> Schneider Trophy winner had reached the peak of its development , and that for Britain 's entrant in the next race to be competitive a new , more powerful engine design was required . The first configuration drawing of the " Racing H " engine , based on the Buzzard , was sent to R. J. Mitchell of Supermarine on 3 July 1928 , allowing Mitchell to start design of the new S.6 Schneider Trophy seaplane . Shortly after this the engine 's name was changed to R for " Racing " . An official British Government contract to proceed with the project was not awarded until February 1929 , leaving Rolls @-@ Royce six months to develop the engine before the planned Schneider Trophy competition of that year . 
 = = = Description = = = 
 The R was a physically imposing engine designed by a team led by Ernest Hives and including Cyril Lovesey , Arthur <unk> and Henry Royce . The R shared the Buzzard 's bore , stroke and capacity , and used the same 60 @-@ degree V @-@ 12 layout . A new single @-@ stage , double @-@ sided supercharger impeller was designed along with revised cylinders and strengthened connecting rods . The wet @-@ liner cylinder blocks , crankcase and propeller reduction gear castings were produced from " <unk> 50 " aluminium alloy ; and because of the short life expectancy of these engines , forged aluminium was used to replace bronze and steel in many parts . 
 To make the R as compact as possible , several design modifications were made in comparison to the Buzzard : the propeller reduction gear housing was reshaped , and the camshaft and rocker covers were modified to fair into the shape of the aircraft 's nose , the air intake was positioned in the vee of the engine ( which also helped to avoid the ingress of spray ) , and beneath the engine the auxiliaries were raised a little to reduce the depth of the fuselage . The engine 's length was minimised by not staggering its cylinder banks fore and aft , which meant that the connecting rods from opposing cylinders had to share a short crankshaft bearing journal known as the " big end " . This was initially achieved by fitting one connecting rod inside the other at the lower end in a blade and fork arrangement ; however , after cracking of the connecting rods was found during testing in 1931 , the rod design was changed to an articulated type . 
 The introduction of articulated connecting rods was regarded as a " nuisance " by Arthur Rubbra , a Rolls @-@ Royce engine designer , as there were inherent problems with the arrangement . The complicated geometry meant that a pair of rods had different effective lengths , giving a longer stroke on the articulated side ; consequently the cylinder liners on that side had to be lengthened to prevent the lower piston ring from running out of the cylinder skirt . Articulated rods were used in the Goshawk engine , but were not embodied in the later Rolls @-@ Royce Merlin , for which Arthur <unk> had designed a revised blade and fork system . 
 Later production R engines featured sodium @-@ filled exhaust valve stems for improved cooling , while additional modifications included a redesigned lower crankcase casting and the introduction of an oil scraper ring below the piston gudgeon pin ; a measure that was carried over to the Merlin engine . A balanced crankshaft was introduced in May 1931 , and the compression ratio on the " sprint " engines prepared for that year was raised from 6 : 1 to 7 : 1 . 
 The ignition system consisted of two rear @-@ mounted , crankshaft @-@ driven magnetos , each supplying one of a pair of spark plugs fitted to each cylinder . This is common practise for aero engines , as it ensures continued operation in the case of a single magneto failure , and has the advantage of more efficient combustion over a single spark plug application . 
 = = = Cooling = = = 
 Cooling this large engine whilst minimising aerodynamic drag posed new challenges for both the Rolls @-@ Royce and Supermarine design teams . Traditional cooling methods using honeycomb @-@ type radiators were known to cause high drag in flight ; consequently it was decided to use the surface skins of the S.6 wings and floats as heat exchangers , employing a double @-@ skinned structure through which the coolant could circulate . Engine oil was cooled in a similar manner using channels in the fuselage and empennage skins . The S.6 was described at the time as a " flying radiator " , and it had been estimated that this coolant system dissipated the equivalent of 1 @,@ 000 hp ( 745 kW ) of heat in flight . However , even with this system in use , engine overheating was noted during the race flights , requiring the pilots to reduce the throttle setting to maintain a safe operating temperature . 
 A not @-@ so @-@ obvious cooling measure was the deliberate use of a rich fuel mixture , which accounts for the frequent reports of black smoke seen issuing from the engine exhaust stubs . Although this robbed the engine of some power , it increased reliability and reduced the possibility of detonation in the cylinders . 
 = = = Supercharger and fuel = = = 
 The keys to the R engine 's high power @-@ to @-@ weight ratio were its supercharger design , ability to run at high revolutions due to its structural strength , and the special blends of fuel used . The double @-@ sided supercharger impeller was a new development for Rolls @-@ Royce : running at a ratio of almost 8 : 1 , it could supply intake air at up to 18 pounds per square inch ( psi ) ( 1 @.@ 24 bar ) above atmospheric pressure , a figure known as " boost " and commonly abbreviated as " + x lb " . By comparison the maximum boost of the earlier Rolls @-@ Royce Kestrel design was + 6 lb ( 0 @.@ 4 bar ) , this figure not being achieved until 1934 . The high boost pressures initially caused the spark plugs to fail on test , and eventually the Lodge type <unk> plug was chosen as it proved to be extremely reliable . 
 The development of special fuel was attributed to the work of " Rod " Banks , an engineer who specialised in fuels and engine development . After using neat benzole for early ground test runs ; a mixture of 11 % aviation petrol and 89 % benzole , plus 5 cubic centimetres ( cc ) of tetra @-@ ethyl lead per Imperial gallon ( 4 @.@ 5 L ) was tried . This blend of fuel was used to win the 1929 Schneider Trophy race , and continued to be used until June 1931 . It was discovered that adding 10 % methanol to this mixture resulted in a 20 hp ( 15 kW ) increase , with the further advantage of reduced fuel weight – particularly important for aircraft use – due to its lowered specific gravity . For the 1931 airspeed record attempt acetone was added to prevent intermittent misfiring , the composition of this final blend was 30 % benzole , 60 % methanol , and 10 % acetone , plus 4 @.@ 2 cc of tetra @-@ ethyl lead per gallon . 
 On an early test run the R engine produced 1 @,@ 400 hp ( 1 @,@ 040 kW ) and was noted to idle happily at 450 revolutions per minute ( rpm ) . With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks , the R engine ultimately developed 2 @,@ 530 hp ( 1 @,@ 890 kW ) at 3 @,@ 200 rpm ; well over double the maximum power output of the Buzzard . The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2 @,@ 783 hp ( 2 @,@ 075 kW ) at 3 @,@ 400 rpm and + 21 lb ( 1 @.@ 45 bar ) of boost , but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B 's airframe not being able to withstand the power , and the inability of the aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption . 
 = = = Testing = = = 
 = = = = Ground testing = = = = 
 The first run of engine R1 took place at Rolls @-@ Royce 's Derby factory on 7 April 1929 with R7 running the next day . Many mechanical failures were experienced during bench testing including burnt valves , connecting rod breakages and main bearing seizures , while considerably more trouble than expected occurred with valve springs ; at one time two or three would be found broken after a 10 @-@ minute run , but the continual redesigning and testing of components reduced all these problems . Unknown to Royce himself , the engineers had also fitted " <unk> " pistons that were better able to withstand the 13 tons " pressure " of each firing stroke . 
 Ground testing of the R involved the use of three Kestrel engines : one to simulate a headwind or airspeed , one to provide ventilation of the test area , and another to cool the crankcase . <unk> could be tested on a separate rig that was driven by another Kestrel engine . Eight men were required to run a test cell , led by the " Chief Tester " who had the tasks of logging the figures and directing the other operators . One of these chief testers was Victor Halliwell who later lost his life whilst on board the water speed record contender Miss England II . The conditions in the test cell were particularly unpleasant ; deafness and tinnitus lasting up to two days were experienced by test personnel even after plugging their ears with cotton wool . Development time was short and the deafening sound of three Kestrels and an R engine running at high power for 24 hours a day took its toll on the local population . The Mayor of Derby stepped in and asked that the people endure the noise for the sake of British prestige ; subsequently testing continued for seven months . 
 In the course of a 25 @-@ minute test an early R engine would consume 60 Imperial gallons ( gal ) ( 270 L ) of pre @-@ heated castor oil . The majority of this was spat out of the exhaust ports and smothered the test cell walls , milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well @-@ known laxative . Up to 200 gal ( 900 L ) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test , 80 gal ( 360 L ) of which were used just to warm the engine to operating temperature . The same coarse @-@ pitch propeller used for flight trials was fitted throughout these tests . 
 = = = = Flight testing = = = = 
 Overseen by Cyril Lovesey , flight testing commenced on 4 August 1929 in the new Supermarine S.6 at RAF Calshot , a seaplane and flying boat station on Southampton Water in Hampshire . During pre @-@ race scrutineering tests , metal particles were found on two of the engine 's 24 spark plugs indicating a piston failure which would require an engine re @-@ build or replacement . The competition rules did not allow an engine change , but due to the foresight of Ernest Hives , several Rolls @-@ Royce engineers and mechanics that were familiar with the R had travelled down to Southampton to witness the trials , and with their assistance one cylinder bank was removed , the damaged piston replaced and the cylinder refurbished . This work was completed overnight and allowed the team to continue in the competition . 
 Engine starting was achieved by a combination of compressed air and a hand @-@ turned magneto ; however , starting problems were encountered during pre @-@ race testing at Calshot due to moisture in the air and water contamination of the fuel . A complicated test procedure was devised to ensure clean fuel for competition flights since more than 0 @.@ 3 % water content made it unusable . As expected , minor engine failures continued to be experienced , and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted Rolls @-@ Royce Phantom I motor car . Travelling mostly after dark , this vehicle became known as the Phantom of The Night . 
 = = = Relationship to the Griffon and Merlin = = = 
 According to Arthur Rubbra 's memoirs , a de @-@ rated version of the R engine , known by the name Griffon at that time , was tested in 1933 . This engine , R11 , was used for " Moderately Supercharged Buzzard development " ( which was not proceeded with until much later ) , and bore no direct relationship to the volume @-@ produced Griffon of the 1940s . 
 The pre @-@ production Griffon I shared the R engine 's bore and stroke , but was otherwise a completely new design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939 . Although this single engine was never flown , the production version , the Griffon II , first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly . A significant difference between the R and the production Griffon was the re @-@ location of the camshaft and supercharger drives to the front of the engine to reduce overall length . Another length @-@ reducing measure was the use of a single magneto ( the R had two , mounted at the rear ) , this again was moved to the front of the engine . 
 Further possible development work on the R engine was discussed in The National Archives ' file <unk> 13 / 122 , which contains a proposal from the Royal Aircraft Establishment dated October and November 1932 , to test four engines to destruction . This document states that there were five engines available for test purposes , the fifth to be used for a standard Type Test at high revolutions . 
 Although not directly related to the Spitfire , the Supermarine engineers gained valuable experience of high @-@ speed flight with the <unk> and S.6 aircraft , their next project being the Rolls @-@ Royce Goshawk @-@ powered Supermarine Type 224 prototype fighter aircraft . Technological advances used in the R engine , such as sodium @-@ cooled valves and spark plugs able to operate under high boost pressures , were incorporated into the Rolls @-@ Royce Merlin design . The author Steve Holter sums up the design of the Rolls @-@ Royce R with these words : 
 Quite simply the R @-@ type engine was far ahead of its time , a marvel of British skill and ability . 
 = = Schneider Trophy use = = 
 The Schneider Trophy was a prestigious annual prize competition for seaplanes that was first held in 1913 . The 1926 race was the first where all the teams fielded pilots from their armed forces , the Air Ministry financing a British team known as the High Speed Flight drawn from the Royal Air Force . Sometimes known simply as The Flight , the team was formed at the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment , Felixstowe , in preparation for the 1927 race in which Supermarine 's Mitchell @-@ designed , Napier Lion @-@ powered Supermarine <unk> placed first and second . 1927 was the last annual competition , the event then moving onto a biannual schedule to allow more development time between races . 
 During the 1929 race at Cowes between Great Britain and Italy , Richard Waghorn flying the Supermarine S.6 with the new Rolls @-@ Royce R engine retained the Schneider Trophy for Great Britain with an average speed of 328 @.@ 63 mph ( 529 km / h ) , and also gained the 50 km and 100 km ( 31 mi and 62 mi ) world speed records . The records were subsequently beaten when Richard <unk> later registered higher speeds when he completed his laps of the circuit . The Italian team placed second and fourth using Fiat <unk> V @-@ 12 @-@ powered Macchi <unk> aircraft . Another racing seaplane , the Fiat <unk> powered by the <unk> engine attended the contest but did not compete . 
 More comparable to the R engine was the Fiat <unk> engine developed for the 1931 contest ; effectively a coupled , double <unk> that suffered from technical problems . With the assistance of Rod Banks , the <unk> powered the Macchi <unk> to a new speed record for piston @-@ powered seaplanes in 1934 of 440 @.@ 6 mph ( 709 @.@ 2 km / h ) , a record that still stands as of 2009 . 
 In 1931 the British Government withdrew financial support , but a private donation of £ 100 @,@ 000 from Lucy , Lady Houston allowed Supermarine to compete on 13 September using the R @-@ powered Supermarine <unk> For this race the engine 's rating was increased by 400 hp ( 300 kW ) to 2 @,@ 300 hp ( 1 @,@ 700 kW ) . The Italian and French entrants however , failed to ready their aircraft and crews in time for the competition , and the remaining British team set both a new world speed record at 379 mph ( 610 km / h ) and , unopposed , won the trophy outright with a third consecutive victory . " The Flight " was wound up within weeks of the 1931 win as there were to be no more Schneider Trophy contests . The original Trophy is on display in the London Science Museum along with the S.6B that secured it , as well as the R engine that powered this aircraft for the subsequent airspeed record flight . 
 = = World speed record use = = 
 New airspeed records were set after the 1929 and 1931 Schneider Trophy contests , both achieved using the R engine . In the two decades before World War II , the quest to break the land speed record was hotly contested , particularly so in the early 1930s . Aero engines were often used to power wheeled vehicles to ever @-@ higher speeds , chosen because of their high power @-@ to @-@ weight ratios : the Liberty engine , Napier Lion and the Sunbeam Matabele were among the engine types used in the 1920s . The Rolls @-@ Royce R was the latest development in high @-@ powered aero engine design at the time , and was chosen by several makers of land speed record @-@ contending cars ; the engine was also chosen for powerboats attempting the water speed record . One car and two boats successfully used the combined power of two R engines .

 Supermarine S.6 
 Immediately after the 1929 Schneider Trophy contest Squadron Leader Augustus <unk> , commanding officer of the High Speed Flight , set a new airspeed record of 355 @.@ 8 mph ( 572 @.@ 6 km / h ) using Supermarine S.6 , <unk> . 
 Supermarine S.6B 
 On 29 September 1931 , barely two weeks after the British team had secured the Schneider Trophy outright , Flight Lieutenant George Stainforth broke the world airspeed record in a Rolls @-@ Royce R @-@ powered Supermarine S.6B , serial S1595 , reaching an average speed of 407 @.@ 5 mph ( 655 @.@ 67 km / h ) . It had been intended to also use the identical sister aircraft , <unk> , for the attempt but Stainforth had capsized it on 16 September whilst testing a propeller .

 Campbell @-@ Railton Blue Bird 
 Sir Malcolm Campbell , and later his son Donald , used R engines from 1931 to 1951 . At Sir Malcolm 's knighthood ceremony in February 1931 , King George V expressed great interest in the R and asked many questions about its fuel consumption and performance . 
 In 1932 , Campbell stated that he " ... was fortunate in procuring a special R.R. Schneider Trophy engine " for his land speed record car to replace its Napier Lion . Lent to him by Rolls @-@ Royce , this engine was either R25 or <unk> . By February 1933 the car , named Blue Bird had been rebuilt to accommodate the larger engine and was running at Daytona . 
 In late 1933 Campbell bought engine R37 from Rolls @-@ Royce ; and had also been lent R17 and R19 by Lord Wakefield , and R39 by Rolls @-@ Royce . He then lent R17 to George Eyston . Once he had achieved the 300 mph ( 480 km / h ) record on 3 September 1935 at the Bonneville Speedway , Campbell retired from further land speed endeavours . 
 Lord Wakefield arranged for a replica of the Rolls @-@ Royce R to be exhibited at the 1933 Motor Show , held at Olympia , London . A press report from the event provides an insight into the public perception of the engine : 
 Of the size only of an office desk ... this 12 @-@ cylinder supercharged racing engine is more powerful than an express locomotive . Its design is stated to be so valuable that it is still on the Government 's secret list . 
 Blue Bird is now on display at the Daytona International Speedway . 
 Thunderbolt 
 During the mid @-@ 1930s , George Eyston set many speed records with his Speed of the Wind car , powered by an <unk> Rolls @-@ Royce Kestrel . In 1937 he built a massive new car , Thunderbolt , powered by two R engines to attempt the absolute land speed record . At first Eyston experienced clutch failure due to the combined power of the engines . Nevertheless , he took the record in November 1937 , reaching 312 mph ( 502 km / h ) , and in 1938 when Thunderbolt reached 357 @.@ 5 mph ( 575 km / h ) . When first built at Bean Industries in Tipton , the <unk> engine fitted to Thunderbolt was R27 which had powered S1595 when it set the air speed record in 1931 . The other was R25 , used by the same aircraft to win the Schneider Trophy two weeks earlier . Eyston had also borrowed R17 from Sir Malcolm Campbell and , with the continuing support that Rolls @-@ Royce extended to both Campbell and Eyston , he also had the option of using R39 . 
 = = = Water speed record = = = 
 Miss England II and III 
 Two R engines , R17 and R19 , were built for Sir Henry Segrave 's twin @-@ engined water speed record boat Miss England II , this craft being ready for trials on Windermere by June 1930 . On Friday 13 June , Segrave was fatally injured and a Rolls @-@ Royce technical advisor , Victor Halliwell , was killed when Miss England II capsized at high speed after possibly hitting a log . Shortly before his death Segrave learnt that he had set a new water speed record of just under 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . On 18 July 1932 , Kaye Don set a new world water speed record of 119 @.@ 81 mph ( 192 @.@ 82 km / h ) on Loch Lomond in a new boat , Miss England III , which also used engines R17 and R19 . 
 Blue Bird K3 
 In late 1935 , Sir Malcolm Campbell decided to challenge the water speed record . At that point he had two Napier Lions and one Rolls @-@ Royce R engine , R37 at his disposal , and it was decided to install the R engine in Blue Bird K3 . During trials on Loch Lomond in June 1937 the engine was " slightly damaged ... because of trouble with the circulating water system " . In August 1937 Blue Bird K3 was taken to Lake Maggiore in Italy where " the modified [ circulation ] system worked perfectly with a second engine " , R39 . 
 Blue Bird K4 and the work of Leo Villa 
 R39 was again used in 1939 in Blue Bird K4 . In 1947 Campbell unsuccessfully converted K4 to jet power using a de Havilland Goblin engine . After Campbell 's death from natural causes in 1948 , Donald Campbell bought K4 for a nominal sum as well as the 1935 record car when his father 's effects were auctioned . He also purchased R37 back from a car dealer and reinstalled it in K4 . Attempts on the record were made in 1949 , and again in 1951 when R37 was " damaged beyond any immediate repair " by overheating . Another attempt was made later in the year using R39 , but K4 suffered a structural failure and sank in Coniston Water . It was recovered and broken up on the shore . 
 The care and maintenance of the Campbell 's R engines was entrusted to Leo Villa , a Cockney born to a Swiss father , who was described as " the man behind the Campbells " and a central figure who " fitted the first nut to the first bolt " . Villa learnt his trade of " aircraft mechanic " in the Royal Flying Corps ; his first job was fitting Beardmore 160 hp engines to airframes . After World War I he worked for a motor racing company and participated as co @-@ driver and mechanic in several races . 
 Villa was first employed by Malcolm Campbell in 1922 , and continued in the service of Donald Campbell until 1967 , when Campbell was killed during a record attempt on Coniston Water . He was the chief caretaker of their R engines until the last R @-@ powered record attempt in 1951 , after which his responsibilities centred on Campbell 's jet engines . Villa 's many responsibilities included installing and removing the engines , repairing and tuning them , and operating the compressed air and magneto for starting them . During the World War II years , he was responsible for the upkeep of Blue Bird K4 and the spare R engines , but unknown to him they had been sold along with K3 . Villa eventually took the three R engines to Thomson & Taylor at Brooklands for long @-@ term storage . 
 His relationship with Malcolm Campbell was strained at times : Campbell , with no engineering background , would often question Villa 's intimate knowledge of the R engine , but his relations with Donald Campbell were much better , as they were of a similar age . At Lake Garda in 1951 Villa noted the willingness of " Don " to help with engineering tasks , and the difficulties of working on the R engine : 
 I was in the workshop stitching the old R37 back together and had the long job of lapping in all 48 valves . It was a terrible job because the engine was two <unk> , which meant that you couldn 't just lift off the heads , you had to lift what amounted to two separate engines and even then getting the valves in was no easy task . But old Don just rolled up his sleeves and mucked in .

 R25 
 The Royal Air Force Museum London at Hendon has a Rolls @-@ Royce R on display ( museum number <unk> ) that came to the museum in November 1965 from RAF Cranwell . According to the museum 's records , before that it was with George Eyston as one of Thunderbolt 's record engines . Its data plate states that it is R25 under Air Ministry contract number <unk> which makes it the second 1931 race engine delivered to RAF Calshot . 
 R27 
 The London Science Museum has an R engine on display which is catalogued as a stand @-@ alone item , inventory number 1948 @-@ 310 . This is R27 , the second sprint engine prepared for the successful air speed record attempt , and later used in Thunderbolt . The Science Museum also has S.6B , S1595 , ( winner of the 1931 race and the final air speed record aircraft ) on display . 
 R37 
 The <unk> Manor Motor Museum has R37 which is destined to be fitted in its restoration of the Blue Bird K3 water speed record boat . 
 These three engines are the only ones listed by the British Aircraft Preservation Council / Rolls @-@ Royce Heritage Trust . The Solent Sky museum 's S.6A , <unk> , ( a competing aircraft in the 1929 race as an S.6 , and stand @-@ by for the 1931 race , modified as an S.6A ) does not contain an R engine .

 = Peresvet @-@ class battleship = 
 The Peresvet class was a group of three pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy around the end of the 19th century . Peresvet and Pobeda were transferred to the Pacific Squadron upon completion and based at Port Arthur from 1901 and 1903 , respectively . All three ships were lost by the Russians in the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 ; Peresvet and Pobeda participated in the Battles of Port Arthur and the Yellow Sea and were sunk during the Siege of Port Arthur . Oslyabya , the third ship , sailed to the Far East with the Second Pacific Squadron to relieve the Russian forces blockaded in Port Arthur and was sunk at the Battle of Tsushima with the loss of over half her crew . 
 Peresvet and Pobeda were salvaged after the Japanese captured Port Arthur and incorporated into the Imperial Japanese Navy . Peresvet was sold back to the Russians during World War I , as the two countries were by now allies , and sank after hitting German mines in the Mediterranean in early 1917 while Pobeda , renamed Suwo , remained instead in Japanese service and participated in the Battle of Tsingtao in late 1914 . She became a gunnery training ship in 1917 . The ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and probably scrapped around that time . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 After the humiliating Russian defeat during the Crimean War of 1854 – 55 , General Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich understood that Russia would never be able to outbuild Britain or France , but still needed a maritime strategy that could defend Russia , give the fleet a useful role in peacetime and act as a deterrent . He decided that a guerre de course ( commerce @-@ raiding ) strategy was Russia 's only effective means of attacking the British Empire or France if war broke out and built a series of fast , long @-@ range , armored cruisers like Rossia and Rurik to implement his strategy . The British responded by building the second @-@ class battleships of the Centurion class to defeat the cruisers and the Russians countered with the three ships of the Peresvet class that were designed to support their armored cruisers . This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor . 
 As was common with Russian ships of the time , changes were made while the ships were under construction . The most important was the revision of the secondary armament from eight 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) and five 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 119 mm ) guns to eleven 6 @-@ inch guns and additional light guns . Only two ships were originally planned , but a third was ordered to keep the Baltic Works shipyard busy until a new design could be prepared . Ironically , it was completed before the second ship , despite having been laid down over three years later . 
 The Peresvet @-@ class ships were 434 feet 5 inches ( 132 @.@ 4 m ) long overall , with a beam of 71 feet 6 inches ( 21 @.@ 8 m ) and a draft of 26 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 0 m ) . Designed to displace 12 @,@ 674 long tons ( 12 @,@ 877 t ) , they were 500 – 1 @,@ 700 long tons ( 510 – 1 @,@ 730 t ) overweight and actually displaced 13 @,@ 320 – 14 @,@ 408 long tons ( 13 @,@ 534 – 14 @,@ 639 t ) . To reduce biofouling , the hulls of the first two ships were sheathed with wood and copper , but this was eliminated in Pobeda to reduce weight . The vessels had a partial double bottom and the hull was divided by 10 watertight transverse bulkheads ; a centerline bulkhead divided the forward engine rooms . Each crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men . 
 The ships were powered by three vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam generated by 30 Belleville boilers . The engines were rated at 14 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 813 kW ) , using forced draft , and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . All three ships slightly exceeded their specifications and reached top speeds of 18 @.@ 3 – 18 @.@ 5 knots ( 33 @.@ 9 – 34 @.@ 3 km / h ; 21 @.@ 1 – 21 @.@ 3 mph ) from 14 @,@ 532 – 15 @,@ 578 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 837 – 11 @,@ 617 kW ) during their sea trials . They carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 060 long tons ( 2 @,@ 090 t ) of coal which allowed them to steam for 6 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 500 km ; 7 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Their electrical equipment consisted of four steam @-@ driven dynamos with a total capacity of 555 kilowatts ( 744 hp ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ships ' main battery consisted of four 45 @-@ caliber , 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) guns mounted in electrically powered twin @-@ gun turrets , one forward and one aft of the superstructure . These guns had major development problems as they proved to be too weak to use a full @-@ strength charge of propellant and had to be reworked and the charge reduced . The guns in Peresvet and Oslyabya were the original model and could be elevated to a maximum of + 35 ° , while the reinforced guns used in Pobeda could only elevate to a maximum of + 25 ° . The guns were designed to fire once every 40 seconds , but in service they fired at half that rate . The ships carried 75 rounds for each gun . The older guns fired a 496 @-@ pound ( 225 @.@ 2 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 270 ft / s ( 692 m / s ) while Pobeda 's newer ones may have reached a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 790 m / s ) . At an elevation of + 6 ° , the gun had a range of 8 @,@ 760 yards ( 8 @,@ 010 m ) . The secondary armament of the Peresvet @-@ class ships consisted of eleven 45 @-@ caliber , 6 @-@ inch Canet Model 1891 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns , 10 mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and one underneath the forecastle as a bow chaser . Each gun was provided with 220 rounds . They fired shells that weighed 91 pounds ( 41 @.@ 4 kg ) with a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 792 @.@ 5 m / s ) . They had a range of 12 @,@ 602 yards ( 11 @,@ 523 m ) when fired at an elevation of + 20 ° . 
 Smaller guns were carried for close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats . These included 20 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) Canet Model 1891 guns . Of these guns , eight were mounted in embrasures in the hull , four on the main deck , four on the battery deck and the last four at the corners of the superstructure on the forecastle deck . The ships carried 300 rounds for each gun . The gun had a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 830 ft / s ( 862 m / s ) with its 10 @.@ 8 @-@ pound ( 4 @.@ 91 kg ) shells . It had a range of about 8 @,@ 606 yards ( 7 @,@ 869 m ) at an elevation of + 20 ° . The smaller guns included twenty QF 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns in hull embrasures and on the superstructure . Each gun had 810 rounds provided . They fired a 3 @.@ 2 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) shell . Eight 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns were positioned between the 47 @-@ millimeter guns on the forecastle deck . They fired a 1 @.@ 1 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 50 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 540 ft / s ( 470 m / s ) . 
 The Peresvet class had five 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , three of which were above water , one in the bow and one pair of broadside tubes , and two broadside underwater tubes . The ships carried a total of 12 torpedoes . They also carried 45 mines to be laid to protect their anchorage in remote areas . 
 The ships were fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric rangefinders that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship , usually the waterline and the crow 's nest , to estimate the range . The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target . He transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro @-@ mechanical fire @-@ control transmission system to each gun or turret . Oslyabya and the rest of the Second Pacific Squadron were also fitted with Perepelkin telescopic sights for their guns , but their crews were not trained in how to use them . 
 = = = Protection = = = 
 The first two ships used Harvey armor for most of their armored vertical surfaces except for the gun turrets and their support tubes , which were made from Krupp armor . Pobeda , however , used Krupp armor for all of her heavy vertical armor . Over the machinery spaces , the maximum thickness of their waterline armor belt was 9 inches ( 229 mm ) which reduced to 7 inches ( 178 mm ) abreast the magazines . The belt tapered to a thickness of 5 inches ( 127 mm ) over the machinery spaces and 4 inches ( 102 mm ) over the magazines . The belt covered 312 feet ( 95 @.@ 1 m ) of the ships ' length and was 7 feet 9 inches ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) high , of which the upper 36 inches ( 914 @.@ 4 mm ) was intended to be above the waterline , but the ships were significantly overweight . So much of the belt was submerged that Peresvet only had 14 inches ( 356 mm ) of armor exposed at normal load ; at full load the effect was even greater and the belt was completely submerged . Oslyabya was even more overweight and only had 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of her belt armor showing at normal load . The belt in both ships terminated in 7 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads , leaving the ends of the ships unprotected . The transverse bulkheads of the waterline belt in Pobeda were eliminated as the belt was extended to the ends of the ship with 4 @-@ inch armor plates . Above the waterline belt in all three ships was a shorter strake of armor that protected the middle of the ships . It was 188 feet ( 57 @.@ 3 m ) long and 4 inches thick . The ends of the upper belt were closed off by 4 @-@ inch angled transverse bulkheads . 
 The sides of the gun turrets were 9 inches thick and 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) of armor protected their roofs ; their supporting tubes were 8 inches ( 203 mm ) thick . The face of the casemates for the 6 @-@ inch guns was five inches thick and their rears were protected by 2 @-@ inch ( 51 mm ) armor plates . The casemates at each end of the ships were protected by 5 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads . Bulkheads 0 @.@ 75 inches ( 19 mm ) thick separated the 75 @-@ millimeter gun positions . Peresvet had two conning towers , each with sides 6 inches thick , but the other two ships only had a forward conning tower with 9 @-@ inch sides . A communications tube 3 inches thick connected each conning tower to the armored deck in all three ships . The flat part of the deck in the central armored citadel consisted of a 1 @.@ 46 @-@ inch ( 37 mm ) plate over the normal 0 @.@ 75 @-@ inch structural steel deck plate ; the sloped portion connected to the lower edge of the waterline belt and was 2 @.@ 5 inches thick . Outside the citadel the armored deck consisted of 2 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 57 mm ) plates laid over the 1 inch ( 25 mm ) deck plating . On the first two ships the deck armor consisted of mild steel ; in Pobeda it was a chrome @-@ nickel steel alloy .

 Peresvet , named after Alexander Peresvet , a Russian monk who fought at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380 , and Pobeda ( Victory ) were sent to the Far East almost immediately after entering service in 1901 and 1903 respectively . Peresvet became flagship of the squadron 's second @-@ in @-@ command , Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky , upon her arrival . During the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war , Peresvet was not hit , but Pobeda was hit once amidships , sustaining little damage but losing two men killed and four wounded . The latter struck a mine during the squadron 's sortie on 13 April and she was under repair for almost two months . Both ships had some of their anti @-@ torpedo boat guns and secondary armament removed during the summer to bolster the defenses of the port . They participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August ; Pobeda was only lightly damaged by 11 large @-@ caliber hits , but Peresvet was hit 39 times and suffered a considerable amount of flooding . More guns were landed after the squadron 's return to Port Arthur , but the Imperial Japanese Army captured the hills overlooking the harbor in November and they allowed the Army 's 28 @-@ centimeter ( 11 in ) siege guns to fire directly at the Russian ships . Pobeda and Peresvet were hit many times and Pobeda sank on 7 December 1904 from the accumulated damage . Peresvet was scuttled in shallow water on that same day . 
 Construction of Oslyabya , named after Radion Oslyabya , another monk who fought at the Battle of Kulikovo , was greatly delayed , and the ship was en route to the Far East when the Russo @-@ Japanese War began in February 1904 . She was ordered home and assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron that was intended to relieve the forces in Port Arthur . The ship served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Baron Dmitry von Fölkersam , second @-@ in @-@ command of the squadron , but he died two days before the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905 . Oslyabya led the Second Division of the squadron during the battle and was the target of numerous Japanese ships during the early part of the battle . Many of the hits on the ship were along the waterline and caused extensive flooding . Efforts to counteract the resulting list destroyed her remaining stability and she sank just over an hour after the Japanese opened fire , the first modern battleship to be sunk solely by gunfire . Sources differ on the exact number of casualties , but the lowest figure given is 471 . 
 = = = In Japanese service = = = 
 Peresvet and Pobeda were raised , repaired , and rearmed by the Japanese . They were incorporated into the Imperial Japanese Navy as Sagami and Suwo , respectively , and reclassified as first @-@ class coastal defense ships . After the beginning of World War I , Sagami was sold to Russia in March 1916 and arrived in Vladivostok on 3 April 1916 , where she resumed her former name of Peresvet . The ship was intended to serve with the Russian Arctic flotilla and was en route to the Arctic when she struck two mines off Port Said , Egypt on 4 January 1917 . The mines had been laid by the German submarine SM U @-@ 73 and Peresvet sank with the loss of 167 lives after catching fire . 
 During World War I , Suwo served as the flagship for the Japanese squadron during the Battle of Tsingtao from 27 August to 7 November 1914 . The ship served as flagship of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet in 1915 – 16 before becoming a gunnery training ship for the rest of the war . In April 1922 , in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty , Suwo was disarmed at the Kure Naval Arsenal . While her armor was being removed , the ship capsized on 13 July . She was probably scrapped in 1922 – 23 , but at least one source suggests she was refloated and hulked , serving until being broken up at Kure in 1946 .

 Kingdom Hearts 358 / 2 Days ( キングダム ハーツ 358 / 2 Days , Kingudamu Hātsu Surī Faibu Eito Deizu <unk> Tsū , subtitle read as " Three Five Eight Days Over Two " ) is an action role @-@ playing video game developed by h.a.n.d. and published by Square Enix for the Nintendo DS . It is the fifth installment in the best @-@ selling Kingdom Hearts series , and takes place near the end of Kingdom Hearts , continuing parallel to Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories . It is a prequel of Kingdom Hearts II . The game launched in Japan on May 30 , 2009 , in North America on September 29 , 2009 and in Europe on October 9 , 2009 . The story is told from the perspective of Roxas , following his daily life within Organization XIII and his relationship with fellow Organization members Axel and Xion . 
 Kingdom Hearts 358 / 2 Days was directed by Tetsuya Nomura and co @-@ directed by Tomohiro Hasegawa . Nomura decided to develop a game for the Nintendo DS , and once a system had been chosen , decided upon Roxas as the protagonist . The development team wanted to use gameplay similar to previous Kingdom Hearts games but could not due to the insufficient number of buttons the DS had . It features 3D graphics , and single- and multiplayer modes of play . 
 Following its release Kingdom Hearts 358 / 2 Days received generally positive response by publications for video games . While critics praised the gameplay and graphics they have also criticized the backtracking and its storyline . The game also achieved good sales worldwide while a soundtrack , light novels and manga series have also been released in Japan . The cinematics from the game have also been rendered in high definition and released within the Kingdom Hearts HD 1 @.@ 5 Remix collection . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 358 / 2 Days features the action role @-@ playing game style of the previous games in the series . To accomplish this , the game makes minimal use of the system 's touch screen functionality , and it is possible to play and complete the game without using it at all . The game includes single player and multiplayer modes of play . The single player mode is story @-@ based , the player controls Roxas , who is accompanied by other Organization XIII members on daily missions to Disney worlds from the previous games . The two modes are linked in that character growth is shared between them . 
 358 / 2 Days features a new gameplay mechanic known as the panel system which involves the customization of the character 's levels , items , equipment , and abilities . For example , certain magic spells cannot be used if their corresponding panels aren 't equipped , but can be used consecutively if multiple are attached . Some panels also occupy multiple slots , but can be combined with other panels to form new or stronger abilities . 
 Limit Breaks , which previously featured in Square 's Final Fantasy series , can be activated during a battle once the character 's health drops below a certain level , indicated by a yellow health bar . Each character has their own unique abilities during Limit Breaks which allow a temporary boost to their normal abilities , whether it be increasing the attack strength or allowing multiple enemies to be attacked at once . The second stage of a Limit Break known as Final Limit is normally a different or powered @-@ up version of the first and begins at the point where the white line ( starting at the high end of the yellow portion of the HP bar ) meets top dead center . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 This is the first Kingdom Hearts game to feature cooperative multiplayer . The multiplayer gameplay is separate from the single player story and is mission @-@ based , including cooperative and competitive player battles . Up to four players can play as one of the fourteen members of Organization XIII , with each member having different weapons , skills , and stats . Sora , Donald , Goofy , King Mickey , and Riku are featured as secret characters in the multiplayer who are unlockable while playing through the main story . 358 / 2 Days ' multiplayer also features a chat system for communication between players , but differs from <unk> in that everyone can draw on the same screen . To prevent players missing out on multiplayer content , the games were developed so that the missions could be completed without the need to connect with other players , instead utilising AI @-@ controlled partners .

 Like the other games in the series , the player progresses through a collection of various worlds , based on various locales from the Disney animated features canon : Agrabah from Aladdin ; the Beast 's Castle from Beauty and the Beast ; Olympus Coliseum from Hercules ; Halloween Town from The Nightmare Before Christmas ; Wonderland from Alice in Wonderland ; and Never Land from Peter Pan ( featuring a string of islands new to the series rather than Captain Hook 's pirate ship and Big Ben from the first game ) . The game also features worlds created specifically for the series by Square Enix . The most prominent world is The World That Never Was , which first appeared in the secret ending of Kingdom Hearts and serves as the game 's main hub , followed by Twilight Town , a frequently @-@ explored locale . Castle Oblivion and Destiny Islands also appear in cutscenes .

 The game revolves around Roxas , who was first featured at the beginning of Kingdom Hearts II . Roxas is the Nobody of Sora , the series ' protagonist , born when Sora 's body vanished as he briefly lost his heart and became a Heartless , and joining Organization XIII , a group of powerful Nobodies who serve as the antagonists of Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories and Kingdom Hearts II . Like Sora , Roxas has the power to wield the Keyblade , a weapon normally used for battling darkness . The other members of Organization XIII play a prominent role as well , particularly Axel , Roxas 's best friend who debuted in Chain of Memories . The game also introduces a new member : Xion , a girl who resembles Sora 's friend Kairi and , like Roxas , can wield the Keyblade . 
 Other characters who are featured include Naminé , a girl with the power to manipulate memories ; DiZ , an enigmatic man wrapped in bandages ; Riku , Sora 's best friend ; and King Mickey , Riku 's ally and ruler of Disney Castle . Sora , the main character of the previous games , is featured prominently in the plot , along with his allies Donald Duck and Goofy , though they appear infrequently in the form of several flashbacks and memory @-@ induced scenarios . Also appearing are Pete , a persistent villain who first appears in Kingdom Hearts II , and <unk> , Pence , and <unk> , a trio of friends living in Twilight Town who also debuted in Kingdom Hearts II . As with the other games in the series , each Disney world features several characters who appear in the films their worlds are based on ; on the other hand , no Final Fantasy characters are featured apart from a Moogle managing a shop for the Organization .

 Xemnas , leader of Organization XIII , finds the newly @-@ born Roxas in Twilight Town and recruits him as its thirteenth member . Unlike other Nobodies , Roxas lacks memories of his original self , but develops a personality of his own as time passes . Each day , Roxas is sent on missions to other worlds , either alone or accompanied by a fellow member , to destroy vast quantities of Heartless with his Keyblade and release stolen hearts , which furthers the Organization 's goal of creating Kingdom Hearts and becoming complete beings . Roxas is placed under the mentorship of fellow member Axel , whom he becomes close friends with . One day , Axel is stationed at Castle Oblivion along with a group of other members , leaving Roxas to be partnered with a girl named Xion , the Organization 's 14th member inducted shortly after Roxas . Roxas and Xion bond over their similarities , including Xion 's ability to wield a Keyblade and lack of memories of her past . Some time later , Roxas falls into a coma caused by the alteration of Sora 's memories , and does not revive until several weeks later , when Axel returns from Castle Oblivion as the only survivor of the group . 
 Over time , Xion develops a friendship with Roxas and Axel , eating sea @-@ salt ice cream with them after missions at the Twilight Town clock tower . Xion soon falls into a coma after failing to eliminate Riku ; like Roxas , she has visions of Sora after waking . In time , Xion questions her own existence , distancing herself from Roxas and Axel to find out about herself . She eventually discovers that she is a replica created by Xemnas from Sora 's memories of Kairi as a fail @-@ safe for Roxas , and that her existence prevents Sora 's memory from being completely restored . Xion is torn between staying with her friends and merging with Sora as per Riku 's advice , but ultimately decides to escape from the Organization after she begins siphoning Roxas ' strength . Understanding her situation , Axel allows Xion to escape , but loses Roxas ' trust . Upon learning Xion 's identity from Xemnas , Roxas begins to question his own identity and defects from the Organization in search of answers , leaving Axel dejected . 
 At Twilight Town , Roxas confronts Xion , whom Xemnas has altered to perform her initial purpose of absorbing Roxas and becoming Sora . After being defeated , Xion requests Roxas to stop Xemnas 's plan before dissipating and merging with Sora , causing everyone 's memories of her to gradually vanish . Back at the World That Never Was , Riku attempts to capture Roxas for DiZ . When Roxas overpowers him , Riku releases the suppressed darkness in his heart , giving him the power necessary to subdue Roxas , but also giving him the physical form of Xehanort 's Heartless Ansem , who resides in his heart . Following Roxas ' defeat and capture , DiZ inserts him into a virtual simulation of Twilight Town without any of his memories of the Organization so that Roxas may eventually merge with Sora and complete the restoration of his memories .

 358 / 2 Days was developed by h.a.n.d. with Square Enix employees overseeing the process . The game was directed by Tetsuya Nomura and co @-@ directed by Tomohiro Hasegawa . In 2007 , Nomura mentioned he wanted to do a spin @-@ off Kingdom Hearts game on a mobile platform and wanted the game to play slightly different from the other titles already in the series . 358 / 2 Days was announced alongside Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep and Kingdom Hearts coded at the Tokyo Game Show on September 20 , 2007 , where a trailer was shown in a photo @-@ prohibited theater . New trailers were shown and a playable demo was available at the 2008 Jump Festa in December 2007 and the DKΣ3713 Private party in August 2008 . Both single player and multiplayer demos were featured . Xion was also shown in the new trailer and in the multiplayer demo . 
 The Nintendo DS was chosen as the system before design work on the game had begun . Roxas was chosen as the game 's protagonist as the staff thought that having a main character besides Sora would help to introduce gamers to the series ' first Nintendo DS title . The staff thought that Roxas ' role as a member of Organization XIII would be a suitable theme for the plot . This idea was furthered during the development of Kingdom Hearts II , where the staff wanted to focus on what influenced Roxas to leave the Organization , which resulted in the creation of Xion 's character who was connected with Roxas ' origins . The development team wanted to have gameplay similar to previous Kingdom Hearts titles , but stated the number of buttons on the Nintendo DS was a problem . Some of the DS 's functions , like the stylus , are not used in order to retain the similar gameplay from previous titles . Roxas seeing Sora 's memories is incorporated throughout the game and has different types of gameplay for each world . The game 's logo uses warm colors as a reference to the sunset in Twilight Town . The meaning behind the title , " 358 / 2 Days " was left unexplained by Nomura during the promotion of the game . Upon completion , the player discerns that it references the story of Xion and Roxas , and their 358 days as members of Organization XIII . 
 Though Birth by Sleep was the first of the three new games to begin development , 358 / 2 Days was released before it . The game was slated for a release at the end of 2008 , but Square Enix pushed the date to February 2009 . Once again the game was delayed for Japanese release until May 30 , 2009 . A release in North American territories was announced on December 2 , 2008 . The official English trailer for the title was shown at Nintendo 's press conference at E3 2009 , confirming a release date of September 29 , 2009 for North America and October 9 , 2009 for Europe .

 The game 's current average score is 75 on Metacritic , and 76 @.@ 74 % on GameRankings . Prior to the game 's release , Nintendo Power 's Chris Hoffman and Steve Thomason referred to the game as highly anticipated , and considered it one of the better titles displayed at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show . The game was met with a range of reviews , ranging from mediocre to positive , where most of the focus was on the game 's graphics and storyline . 
 The graphics of the game were heavily praised by many reviewers , with Hoffman and Thomason going as far as to call them among the best on the system , and complimented the familiar feel of the gameplay and its transition between the PlayStation home consoles and the portable Nintendo ones . Game Informer gave the game an 8 out of 10 , praising the graphics for excellent production values and the journey of the camera controls from the PlayStation Analog Stick to the DS shoulder buttons . The Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the game 9 / 9 / 9 / 9 ( 36 / 40 ) and praised the graphical quality of the game saying they were at a level which had not been seen on a DS before , further complimenting the gameplay mechanics and missions . They were also particularly impressed with the new panel system which allows the player to customize their fighting techniques as well as the ability to customize the characters from the Organization . Unlike many other reviewers , they praised the story as " strongly captivating . " The Australian video game talk show Good Game 's two reviewers gave the game a 7 / 10 and 7 @.@ 5 / 10 , grateful that the game didn ’ t force the use of the stylus , especially when it came to battle . 
 The RPGFan reviewer gave the game an 81 out of 100 , praising the visual and aural quality , however they expressed disappointment at the recycling of most of the music from Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II . Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot was complimentary of the single @-@ player mode , commenting specifically that the artificial intelligence @-@ controlled Organization XIII members were helpful and competent . He also praised the multiplayer mode 's gameplay , calling it " fun " and citing the ease of using magic spells and items . 
 The controls and overall story were of particular criticism by the reviewers , with VanOrd stating that the on @-@ screen character ended up in one of the game field 's corners often . RPGamer was highly critical of these facts , as it handed the game a 2 @.@ 5 / 5 score and reviewer Alex Reimer concluded , " ... many fans of the series may be turned off by the lackluster controls and odd story directions taken with this portable spin @-@ off . " The Official Nintendo Magazine gave the game a mediocre score of 69 % praising the graphics and gameplay , they were critical however of the constant backtracking and confusing plot . Good Game 's reviewers stated that while the plot was confusing , and made little sense for players new to the series , it still drew you in and filled in the gaps of the storyline for continuing players of the series . They surmised that the repetition of worlds and missions , and overall lack of variety , combined with lengthy storytelling really hurt the gamer experience .

 = Bernard Lee = 
 John Bernard Lee ( 10 January 1908 – 16 January 1981 ) , known as Bernard Lee , was an English actor , best known for his role as M in the first eleven Eon @-@ produced James Bond films . Lee 's film career spanned 1934 to 1979 , though he had appeared on stage from the age of six . He was trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London . 
 Lee appeared in over one hundred films , as well as on stage and television dramatisations . He was known for his roles as authority figures , often playing military characters or policemen , and highlights in his career include The Third Man , The Blue Lamp , The Battle of the River Plate , and Whistle Down the Wind . 
 He died of stomach cancer on 16 January 1981 , aged 73 .

 = = = Early life = = = 
 Lee was born on 10 January 1908 , the son of Nellie ( née Smith ) and Edmund James Lee . He was born in either County Cork in what is now the Republic of Ireland , or Brentford , London . Lee 's father was also an actor and Bernard 's first appearance on stage in 1914 , at the age of six , was with his father in a sketch called " The Double Event " at the Oxford Music Hall in London . Lee attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , working as a fruit porter to pay his fees . During the 1930s , after graduating from RADA , he initially worked in repertory theatre in Rusholme and Cardiff before beginning work on the West End stage in thrillers , such as Blind Man 's Bluff . Lee also played comedic roles , such as with Arthur Askey in Ten Minute Alibi . 
 Lee 's screen debut was in The Double Event in 1934 , followed by a role as Cartwright in Berthold Viertel 's Rhodes of Africa ( 1936 ) , a biopic of Cecil Rhodes , in which he starred alongside Walter Huston , Oskar <unk> , and Basil Sydney . Terence Pettigrew mentions a " witty scene " featuring Bernard Lee in the film in which he is " struggling to put on a tight collar prior to slipping into town for a few ales . " Although Lee was in wartime service in the army between 1940 and 1946 , he had managed to act in several films earlier which were released between 1939 and 1943 , including Murder in Soho , The Frozen Limits , Let George Do It ! ( known in the US as To Hell with Hitler ) , Spare a Copper , Once a Crook , and The New Lot . 
 = = = Second World War to 1962 = = = 
 Lee 's wartime service was with the Royal Sussex Regiment , and while he was awaiting his <unk> he attended golfing ladies ' night , where he met a producer , and was subsequently offered a part in the play Stage Door . 
 After the war , Lee returned to the stage whilst also developing a successful film career . He appeared in Herbert Wilcox 's The <unk> of Curzon Street ( 1947 ) , playing a colonel alongside Anna Neagle , Michael Wilding and Daphne Slater ; the film was a major success and became the best @-@ selling film at the British box office of 1947 . He developed a reputation for playing " solid , dependable characters such as policemen , serving officers or officials " in films such as The Fallen Idol ( 1948 ) , The Third Man ( 1949 ) , The Blue Lamp ( 1950 ) , Last Holiday ( 1950 ) , Cage of Gold ( 1950 ) , Mr. Denning Drives North ( 1952 ) , The Yellow Balloon ( 1953 ) , Beat the Devil ( 1953 ) , and Father Brown ( 1954 ) , and commanders , colonels , or brigadiers in films such as Morning Departure ( 1950 ) , Calling Bulldog Drummond ( 1951 ) , Appointment with Venus ( 1951 ) , and many more . In John Huston 's Beat the Devil , Terence Pettigrew considers Lee to have been instrumental to the climax of the film , remarking that it was " left to Bernard Lee to inject a badly needed touch of earthiness at the end . " In total , Lee appeared in over one hundred films during his career . 
 During the 1950s he had a long run on stage , appearing as Able Seaman Turner in Seagulls Over Sorrento , a role he later reprised in the film of the same name with Gene Kelly ( released in the US as Crest of the Wave ) . In 1954 Lee starred opposite Gregory Peck in The Purple Plain , playing a Royal Air Force medical officer based in Burma during the late Second World War . In 1956 he portrayed Captain Patrick Dove in one of the most successful British films of that year , Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger 's war film The Battle of the River Plate , based upon the battle of the same name . He starred alongside John Gregson , Anthony Quayle and Peter Finch . George Lovell remarked that Captain Patrick Dove was played " ponderously by Bernard Lee , but he forms a much closer bond with the battleship 's commander , Captain Langsdorff ( Peter Finch ) . " The film was critically acclaimed , nominated for three BAFTA Awards in 1957 , for " Best British Film " , " Best British Screenplay " and " Best Film From Any Source " , and was the fourth most popular film in Britain in 1957 . Other films of this period include The Spanish Gardener ( 1956 ) , Dunkirk ( 1958 ) , Beyond This Place ( 1959 ) , Whistle Down the Wind ( 1961 ) , and The L @-@ Shaped Room ( 1962 ) . 
 = = = Bond and beyond = = = 
 In 1962 Lee was cast in the role that The Illustrated Who 's Who of the Cinema thought would probably be his best remembered , playing the character of M , the head of the Secret Intelligence Service ( MI6 ) — and the superior of James Bond — in the first Eon Productions film , Dr. No . A number of Bond scholars have noted that Lee 's interpretation of the character was in line with the original literary representation ; Cork and Stutz observed that Lee was " very close to Fleming 's version of the character " , whilst Rubin commented on the serious , efficient , no @-@ nonsense authority figure . Smith and Lavington , meanwhile , remarked that Lee was " the very incarnation of Fleming 's crusty admiral . " One American newspaper , The Spokesman @-@ Review , described Lee as " a real roast @-@ beef @-@ and @-@ Yorkshire @-@ pudding type of British actor . " Murray Pomerance refers to Lee as a " paternal actor " in embodying this role . Terence Pettigrew , in his study British film character actors : great names and memorable moments agreed , noting that Lee was a " gruff , reliable , no @-@ nonsense role character actor " , with " kindly eyes , droll manner and expressly Anglo @-@ Saxon level @-@ headedness " . In 1967 Lee appeared in O.K. Connery , a spoof of the James Bond film series which starred Connery 's brother Neil Connery , Lois Maxwell ( Miss Moneypenny ) , and several former actors of the series . During this period he also appeared in several ITC television productions such as The Baron , Man in a Suitcase , and Danger Man . In 1972 he portrayed <unk> the sculptor in Terence Fisher 's Hammer Horror picture Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell , alongside Peter Cushing , Shane Briant , and David Prowse ; it was not released until 1974 . 
 On 30 January 1972 Lee 's first wife , Gladys <unk> , died in a fire at their seventeenth @-@ century home in Oare , Kent which also left Lee hospitalised . According to actor Jack Warner , " Bernard and Gladys had a lovely seventeenth @-@ century cottage in the Kent village of Oare , and it was there she died tragically in a fire early in 1972 . Bernard and Gladys were trapped in their bedroom when the fire started on the ground floor . Bernard escaped through a window and ran to get a ladder in an attempt to rescue Gladys , but unhappily was unsuccessful . It was an awful end to a long and happy marriage . " In February 1972 Lee was mugged and robbed by two youths . After the mugging and fire , Lee turned to drink , was unable to find work for two years , and ran into debt . By chance Lee met Richard Burton in a pub , who , upon hearing of Lee 's problems , gave him a cheque for $ 6 @,@ 000 to clear his debts , together with a note saying that everyone has a spot of trouble once in a while . Burton 's gift assisted Lee in overcoming his depression . In 1975 both Lee and Lois Maxwell accepted roles in their usual Bond characters in the poorly received French James Bond spoof , From Hong Kong with Love . 
 Three years after the fire , Lee married television director 's assistant Ursula McHale . Lee 's first marriage produced a daughter , Ann , who also followed her father onto the stage , and did so with his blessing , Lee saying " She 's doing what she wants to do and enjoying every moment of it . " Ann later married Alan Miller , a stage actor and later a stage manager at the BBC : their son is the British actor Jonny Lee Miller . Lee 's hobbies included golf , fishing , reading , music and sailing .

 In November 1980 Lee was admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London , suffering from stomach cancer . He died there on 16 January 1981 , just six days after his 73rd birthday ; his wife Ursula was present at his death . After his death , Ursula joined Exit ( now Dignity in Dying ) after witnessing Lee 's suffering . 
 Lee died after filming had started on For Your Eyes Only , but before he could film his scenes as M. Out of respect for Lee , no replacement was found , and the script was re @-@ written so that the character was said to be on leave . A year after Lee 's death , Terence Pettigrew summarised his acting work as a " Gruff , reliable , no @-@ nonsense role character actor , whose many credits include policemen , servicemen , father figures , and spy chiefs . Mostly shows the honest , hard @-@ working face of officialdom , with only very occasional lapses . "

 = Joseph Scelsi Intermodal Transportation Center = 
 The Joseph Scelsi Intermodal Transportation Center ( also called the Scelsi ITC ) is a transit facility located in downtown Pittsfield , Massachusetts . The $ 11 million facility is named after Joseph Scelsi , a longtime State Representative who represented Pittsfield . Owned by the Berkshire Regional Transit Authority ( BRTA ) , it is serviced by local BRTA bus services , Amtrak intercity rail service , and Peter Pan intercity bus service . 
 Railroad stations have been located in downtown Pittsfield since the Western Railroad opened in 1841 . The original station burned in 1854 ; after its replacement proved inadequate , a union station was constructed in 1866 to serve the Western plus the Housatonic Railroad and the Pittsfield and North Adams Railroad . A second , larger union station replaced it in 1914 . The New Haven Railroad and New York Central Railroad moved to smaller depots in 1960 and 1965 , and Union Station was demolished in 1968 . Rail service to Pittsfield ended in 1971 but returned in 1975 and moved to a new shelter downtown in 1981 . The Scelsi ITC opened in 2004 to combine local and intercity bus and intercity rail operations into one location . 
 The second floor of the building houses two classrooms used by Berkshire Community College and Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts .

 = = = Early stations = = = 
 The Western Railroad opened from the New York – Massachusetts state line to Pittsfield , Massachusetts on July 4 , 1841 ; the first train from the state line to Springfield ran on October 4 , 1841 . A wooden station had been built the previous year at West Street in Pittsfield . Its design , a " wooden imitation of Egyptian architecture " with Greek columns in <unk> , was an example of the architecture of railroads combining familiar forms with the unfamiliar technology , a juxtaposition common in Europe . Passengers boarded from a dank lower level , and the station was vastly unpopular . 
 The Pittsfield and North Adams Railroad opened to the north on October 6 , 1846 ; it was owned and operated by the Western and shared its depot . The Stockbridge and Pittsfield Railroad opened to the south in January 1850 and was immediately merged into the Housatonic Railroad ; it used a depot near West Street around 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) away from the Western Railroad station . With the completion of the Housatonic , passengers could travel in four directions from Pittsfield : west to Albany , north to North Adams , east to Springfield and Boston , and south to Bridgeport and New York City . 
 Like many wooden stations of the era , the 1840 depot did not last long ; it burned in half an hour at noon on November 5 , 1854 . An 1876 history of the city reported that : 
 The flames presented a beautiful spectacle , as they swept through its large , hollow , wooden columns , and no regret for the loss of the building checked the enjoyment of the scene . It was never so much admired as during the last half @-@ hour of its existence . 
 The Western soon replaced it with a more conventional one @-@ story wooden station slightly to the west . Although well @-@ liked , it proved too small within a decade . 
 = = = The first Union Station = = = 
 By the mid @-@ 1860s , the crowded conditions at the Western Railroad station , and its location 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) away from the Housatonic station ( a headache for transferring passengers ) led to calls for a union station to be built . Although initially mutually antagonistic , the two railroads ultimately agreed for their common good . On April 7 , 1866 , the Massachusetts General Court passed a law authorizing the construction of a union station at West Street facing Park Square . Berkshire County was authorized to build a bypass of West Street under the tracks to eliminate the level crossing and provide room for the depot . The station was to be owned by the Western Railroad but shared equally by both . 
 The new 7 @,@ 456 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 692 @.@ 7 m2 ) Union Station , described as " one of the most convenient and beautiful depots in the country " was quickly constructed and opened by the end of the year . The brick structure occupied an obtuse triangular footprint with the long side facing the tracks . All three corners featured a tower , with the front corner the highest . A pedestrian bridge over the tracks connected the station with neighborhoods off West Street and Francis Avenue to the west . The Pittsfield Street Railway opened in 1886 and was electrified in 1891 as the Pittsfield Electric Street Railway ; the Pittsfield Electric and its successor the Berkshire Street Railway operated a spur on West Street to bring streetcars directly to the station . 
 After years of feuding , the Western Railroad joined with the Boston and Worcester Railroad in 1867 to become the Boston and Albany Railroad ( B & A ) . The Housatonic Railroad was acquired by the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad ( NYNH & H ) as its Berkshire Division in 1892 , with most service thus running from Danbury rather than Bridgeport . In 1900 , the New York Central Railroad ( NYC ) leased the B & A , though the latter retained its independent identity for decades after . The B & A operated a rail yard and roundhouse just north of Union Station . 
 = = = The second Union Station = = = 
 Four decades after its construction , Union Station was proving too small for its role as the principal railroad hub of Berkshire County . In 1908 local residents began agitating for a larger station , and William H. MacInnis made it a platform of his mayoral candidacy . In 1910 MacInnis appointed a three @-@ man committee ( one a director of the B & A ) to lobby the railroad authorities to replace Union Station . Financial constraints at first hampered their <unk> but in April 1912 the B & A agreed to support the project . In 1913 , the NYNH & H acquired the former Burbank Hotel property and began constructing the second Union Station . 
 The new Union Station cost $ 400 @,@ 000 all told , with construction of the station itself costing $ 300 @,@ 000 . Constructed in the Beaux Arts style of red brick with white terra cotta trim , the station was more than twice its predecessor 's size at 17 @,@ 953 square feet ( 1 @,@ 667 @.@ 9 m2 ) . A high terrazzo ceiling contained skylights to supplement the high arched windows . The walls were green marble for the dado and " white , green @-@ veined Vermont marble " above ; furnishings were polished wood , and the city 's seal was reproduced in <unk> on the floor . Modern conveniences included all @-@ electric chandeliers , thermostat @-@ controlled heat , an intercom for announcing trains , and a restaurant inside the station building . 
 At its peak in 1912 , the B & A operated 12 Boston @-@ Albany round trips , one Boston @-@ Pittsfield round trip , and as many as 10 Pittsfield @-@ North Adams round trips . Around 1913 the New Haven planned to use the Housatonic as part of a New York @-@ Montreal through route to compete with the NYC , but this never materialized and service levels were never high . After 1926 New Haven operated two daily New York @-@ Pittsfield round trips with additional weekend service plus a Great Barrington @-@ Pittsfield commuter trip operated by a rail bus . After 1935 , nonstop New York @-@ Pittsfield weekend trips were added for skiers during the winter . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 Berkshire Division service began to decline before World War II , when increased automobile availability reduced the appeal of travel by train . The line had always used the oldest equipment on the railroad , and all trains except one weekly round trip lost their parlor cars in 1940 and 1942 . In January 1960 , profitable railway post office service was ended due to unsuitable schedules , and starting in March 1960 all trains except two weekend through round trips were run by single Budd <unk> and truncated to Danbury where passengers could change for local trains to New York . In November 1960 , the New Haven moved its station services from Union Station to a converted freight house slightly to the east to save money , leaving the B & A alone in the station . In March 1964 , the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized the NYNH & H to cut all Berkshire Division services except the weekend trips . 
 B & A service was also cut due to financial problems in the late 1930s and again after World War II ; by 1950 , Pittsfield was served by eight Boston @-@ Albany round trips per day . The four daily trips to North Adams ended in 1953 . The opening of the Massachusetts Turnpike in 1957 and the Berkshire Thruway two years later provided for the first time an auto route to western Massachusetts superior to the narrow and winding Route 20 ; this effectively decimated long distance service on the B & A. In January 1960 the NYC received permission to discontinue all B & A service that April , but public outcry prevented full cancellation . On April 24 , 1960 , stops west of Framingham except Worcester , Palmer , Springfield , and Pittsfield were closed ; Boston @-@ Albany service via Pittsfield was reduced to just 3 @.@ 5 daily round trips . Still facing losses , the B & A was finally fully absorbed into the NYC in 1961 , effectively subsidized by its popular New York commuter service . The crack New England States , introduced in 1938 , was combined with the 20th Century Limited west of Buffalo on November 5 , 1967 . After the latter was discontinued on December 2 , the New England States lost its named distinction on December 3 . 
 In 1956 , the NYC attempted to sell Union Station to the city for use as a city hall , in order to downsize into a less expensive station . The public was indifferent to the proposal , but the city refused because decades of deferred maintenance ( caused by neglecting stations in order to have the funds to run federally @-@ required trains ) had left the station in extremely poor condition . In 1965 , over the objections of city councilman ( and later state representative ) Joseph Scelsi , the city council allowed the NYC to build a much smaller wooden station 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of downtown near the large manufacturing plants of General Electric and other companies . Although preservation attempts were made in 1966 , the Union Station building was too deteriorated to save , and it was demolished for urban renewal efforts in 1968 . Some fragments of the station may have been saved . 
 The NYC merged into Penn Central Railroad on February 1 , 1968 , followed by the New Haven on December 31 . Penn Central continued to run the twice @-@ weekly Berkshire Division train and the daily Boston @-@ Albany train ( the former , nameless New England States ) through Pittsfield until April 30 , 1971 . On May 1 , 1971 , Amtrak took over most passenger service in the United States . Service between Worcester and Albany along the Boston and Albany Railroad route , as well as all service on the Housatonic , was discontinued , leaving Pittsfield with no passenger rail service for the first time in 130 years .
