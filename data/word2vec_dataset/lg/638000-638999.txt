 The imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes are strong bases , having a pKa of ca . 24 for the conjugate acid in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) : 
 However , further work showed that diaminocarbenes will <unk> the DMSO solvent , with the resulting anion reacting with the resulting <unk> salt . 
 Reaction of imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes with 1 @-@ <unk> gave 90 % of the 2 @-@ substituted adduct , with only 10 % of the corresponding alkene , indicating that these molecules are also reasonably nucleophilic . 
 pKa values for the conjugate acids of several NHC families have been examined in aqueous <unk> pKa values of triazolium ions lie in the range 16 @.@ 5 - 17 @.@ 8 , around 3 pKa units more acidic than related imidazolium ions .

 At one time , stable carbenes were thought to reversibly dimerise through the so @-@ called Wanzlick equilibrium . However , imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes and triazol @-@ 5 @-@ ylidenes are thermodynamically stable and do not dimerise , and have been stored in solution in the absence of water and air for years . This is presumably due to the aromatic nature of these carbenes , which is lost upon dimerisation . In fact imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes are so thermodynamically stable that only in highly constrained conditions are these carbenes forced to dimerise . 
 Chen and <unk> made a doubly tethered <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene by deprotonating the respective <unk> salt . Only the deprotonation of the doubly tethered <unk> salt with the shorter methylene bridge ( <unk> ) resulted in the <unk> dimer : 
 If this dimer existed as a <unk> , the electron lone pairs on the carbenic carbon would be forced into close proximity . Presumably the resulting repulsive electrostatic interactions would have a significant destabilising effect . To avoid this electronic interaction , the carbene units dimerise . 
 On the other hand , <unk> carbenes ( e.g. R2N @-@ C : <unk> or R2N @-@ C : <unk> ) and non @-@ aromatic carbenes such as diaminocarbenes ( e.g. R2N @-@ C : -NR2 ) have been shown to dimerise , albeit quite slowly . This has been presumed to be due to the high barrier to singlet state dimerisation : 
 <unk> do not truly dimerise , but rather form the dimer by reaction via formamidinium salts , a protonated precursor species . Accordingly , this reaction can be acid catalysed . This reaction occurs because unlike imidazolium based carbenes , there is no loss of aromaticity in protonation of the carbene . 
 Unlike the dimerisation of triplet state carbenes , these singlet state carbenes do not approach head to head ( " least motion " ) , but rather the carbene lone pair attacks the empty carbon p @-@ orbital ( " non @-@ least motion " ) . Carbene dimerisation can be catalyzed by both acids and metals . 
 = = = Reactivity = = = 
 The chemistry of stable carbenes has not been fully explored . However , Enders et al. have performed a range of organic reactions involving a triazol @-@ 5 @-@ ylidene . These reactions are outlined below and may be considered as a model for other carbenes . 
 These carbenes tend to behave in a nucleophilic fashion ( e and f ) , performing insertion reactions ( b ) , addition reactions ( c ) , [ 2 + 1 ] cycloadditions ( d , g and h ) , [ 4 + 1 ] cycloadditions ( a ) as well as simple <unk> . The insertion reactions ( b ) probably proceed via deprotonation , resulting in the generation of a nucleophile ( − XR ) which can attack the generated salt giving the impression of a H @-@ X insertion . 
 The reported stable <unk> carbene ( 2 ) derived from an <unk> perchlorate ( 1 ) was questioned , who were only able to isolate 2 @-@ imino @-@ 2H @-@ <unk> ( 4 ) . The intermediate 3 was proposed through a rearrangement reaction . This carbene is no longer considered stable .

 Imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes , triazol @-@ 5 @-@ ylidenes ( and less so , diaminocarbenes ) have been shown to co @-@ ordinate to a plethora of elements , from alkali metals , main group elements , transition metals and even lanthanides and actinides . A periodic table of elements gives some idea of the complexes which have been prepared , and in many cases these have been identified by single crystal X @-@ ray crystallography . Stable carbenes are believed to behave in a similar fashion to <unk> in their co @-@ ordination properties to metals . These ligands are said to be good σ @-@ donors through the carbenic lone pair , but poor π @-@ acceptors due to internal ligand back @-@ donation from the nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carbene centre , and so are able to co @-@ ordinate to even relatively electron deficient metals . Enders and Hermann have shown that these carbenes are suitable replacements for phosphine ligands in several catalytic cycles . Whilst they have found that these ligands do not activate the metal catalyst as much as phosphine ligands they often result in more robust catalysts . Several catalytic systems have been looked into by Hermann and Enders , using catalysts containing imidazole and triazole carbene ligands , with moderate success . Grubbs has reported replacing a phosphine ligand ( <unk> ) with an imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene in the olefin metathesis catalyst <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> , and noted increased ring closing metathesis as well as exhibiting " a remarkable air and water stability " . Molecules containing two and three carbene moieties have been prepared as potential bidentate and <unk> carbene ligands .

 Carbenes can be stabilised as organometallic species . These transition metal carbene complexes fall into two categories : 
 Fischer carbenes in which carbenes are tethered to a metal and an electron @-@ withdrawing group ( usually a carbonyl ) , 
 Schrock carbenes ; in which carbenes are tethered to a metal and an electron @-@ donating group . The reactions that such carbenes participate in are very different from those in which organic carbenes participate . 
 = = = Triplet state carbene chemistry = = = 
 Persistent triplet state carbenes are likely to have very similar reactivity as other non @-@ persistent triplet state carbenes . 
 = = Physical properties = = 
 Those carbenes that have been isolated to date tend to be colorless solids with low melting points . These carbenes tend to sublime at low temperatures under high vacuum . 
 One of the more useful physical properties is the diagnostic chemical shift of the carbenic carbon atom in the 13C @-@ NMR spectrum . Typically this peak is in the range between 200 and 300 ppm , where few other peaks appear in the 13C @-@ NMR spectrum . An example is shown on the left for a cyclic diaminocarbene which has a carbenic peak at 238 ppm . 
 Upon coordination to metal centers , the 13C carbene resonance usually shifts <unk> , depending on the Lewis acidity of the complex fragment . Based on this observation , Huynh et al. developed a new methodology to determine ligand donor strengths by 13C NMR analysis of trans @-@ palladium ( II ) <unk> complexes . The use of a 13C @-@ labeled N @-@ heterocyclic carbene ligand also allows for the study of mixed carbene @-@ phosphine complexes , which undergo trans @-@ cis @-@ isomerization due to the trans effect . 
 = = Applications = = 
 NHCs are widely used as ancillary ligand in organometallic chemistry . One practical application is the ruthenium @-@ based Grubbs ' catalyst and NHC @-@ Palladium Complexes for cross @-@ coupling reactions . NHC @-@ metal complexes , specifically Ag ( I ) <unk> complexes have been widely tested for their biological applications . 
 = = Preparation methods = = 
 NHCs are often strongly basic ( the pKa value of the conjugate acid of an imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene was measured at ca . 24 ) and react with oxygen . Clearly these reactions are performed using air @-@ free techniques , avoiding compounds of even moderate acidity . Although imidazolium salts are stable to nucleophilic addition , other non @-@ aromatic salts are not ( i.e. formamidinium salts ) . 
 In these cases , strong unhindered nucleophiles are avoided whether they are generated in situ or are present as an impurity in other reagents ( e.g. , LiOH in BuLi ) . 
 Several approaches have been developed in order to prepare stable carbenes , these are outlined below . 
 = = = Deprotonation = = = 
 Deprotonation of carbene precursor salts with strong bases has proved a reliable route to almost all stable carbenes : 
 Imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes and dihydroimidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes , e.g. Imes , have been prepared by the deprotonation of the respective imidazolium and <unk> salts . The acyclic carbenes and the <unk> based carbenes were prepared by deprotonation using strong homogeneous bases . 
 Several bases and reaction conditions have been employed with varying success . The degree of success has been principally dependent on the nature of the precursor being deprotonated . The major drawback with this method of preparation is the problem of isolation of the free carbene from the metals ions used in their preparation . 
 = = = = Metal hydride bases = = = = 
 One might believe that sodium or potassium hydride would be the ideal base for deprotonating these precursor salts . The hydride should react irreversibly with the loss of hydrogen to give the desired carbene , with the inorganic by @-@ products and excess hydride being removed by filtration . In practice this reaction is often too slow , requiring the addition of DMSO or t @-@ <unk> . These reagents generate soluble catalysts , which increase the rate of reaction of this heterogeneous system , via the generation of tert @-@ butoxide or <unk> anion . However , these catalysts have proved ineffective for the preparation of non @-@ imidazolium adducts as they tend to act as nucleophiles towards the precursor salts and in so doing are destroyed . The presence of hydroxide ions as an impurity in the metal hydride could also destroy non @-@ aromatic salts . 
 Deprotonation with sodium or potassium hydride in a mixture of liquid ammonia / THF at <unk> ° C has been reported for imidazole @-@ based carbenes . Arduengo and co @-@ workers managed to prepare a dihydroimidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene using <unk> . However , this method has not been applied to the preparation of diaminocarbenes . In some cases , potassium tert @-@ butoxide can be employed without the addition of a metal hydride . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 The use of <unk> as strong bases has not been extensively studied , and have been unreliable for deprotonation of precursor salts . With non @-@ aromatic salts , n @-@ BuLi and <unk> can act as nucleophiles whilst t @-@ BuLi can on occasion act as a source of hydride , reducing the salt with the generation of <unk> : 
 = = = = <unk> bases = = = = 
 Lithium amides like the <unk> ( LDA ) and the ( <unk> ( <unk> ) ) generally work well for the deprotonation of all types of salts , providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n @-@ butyllithium used to make the lithium amide . <unk> of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution . The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal <unk> works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts , except for unhindered formamidinium salts , where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a <unk> adduct . 
 = = = Metal @-@ free carbene preparation = = = 
 The preparation of stable carbenes free from metal cations has been keenly sought to allow further study of the carbene species in isolation from these metals . Separating a carbene from a carbene @-@ metal complex can be problematic due to the stability of the complex . Accordingly , it is preferable to make the carbene free from these metals in the first place . Indeed , some metal ions , rather than stabilising the carbene , have been implicated in the catalytic dimerisation of unhindered examples . 
 Shown right is an X @-@ ray structure showing a complex between a diaminocarbene and potassium HMDS . This complex was formed when excess <unk> was used as a strong base to <unk> the formamidinium salt . Removing lithium ions resulting from deprotonation with reagents such as LDA can be especially problematic . Potassium and sodium salt by @-@ products tend to precipitate from solution and can be removed . Lithium ions may be chemically removed by binding to species such as <unk> or crown ethers . 
 Metal free carbenes have been prepared in several ways as outlined below : 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Another approach of preparing carbenes has relied on the desulfurisation of <unk> with potassium in THF . A contributing factor to the success of this reaction is that the byproduct , potassium sulfide , is insoluble in the solvent . The elevated temperatures suggest that this method is not suitable for the preparation of unstable <unk> carbenes . A single example of the <unk> of a urea with a <unk> derived carbene to give the <unk> and <unk> has also been reported : 
 The desulfurisation of <unk> with molten potassium to give imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes or diaminocarbenes has not been widely used . The method was used to prepare dihydroimidazole carbenes . 
 = = = = Vacuum pyrolysis = = = = 
 Vacuum pyrolysis , with the removal of neutral volatile by @-@ products ( CH3OH , <unk> ) , has been used to prepare dihydroimidazole and triazole based carbenes : 
 Historically the removal of chloroform by vacuum pyrolysis of d adducts was used by Wanzlick in his early attempts to prepare dihydroimidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes but this method is not widely used . The Enders laboratory has used vacuum pyrolysis of a c adduct to generate a triazolium @-@ 5 @-@ ylidene c . 
 = = = = Bis ( <unk> ) mercury = = = = 
 Bis ( <unk> ) mercury ( CH3 ) 3Si @-@ Hg @-@ Si ( CH3 ) 3 reacts with chloro @-@ iminium and chloro @-@ <unk> salts to give a metal @-@ free carbene and elemental mercury . For example , ( CH3 ) 3Si @-@ Hg @-@ Si ( CH3 ) 3 + R2N = C ( Cl ) -NR2 + Cl − → R2N @-@ C : -NR2 + Hg ( l ) + ( CH3 ) 3Si @-@ Cl 
 = = = = <unk> decomposition = = = = 
 Persistent triplet state carbenes have been prepared by photochemical decomposition of a <unk> product via the expulsion of nitrogen gas , at a wavelength of 300 nm in benzene . 
 = = = Purification = = = 
 Stable carbenes are very reactive , and so the minimum amount of handling is desirable using air @-@ free techniques . However , provided rigorously dry , relatively non @-@ acidic and air @-@ free materials are used , stable carbenes are reasonably robust to handling per se . By way of example , a stable carbene prepared from potassium hydride can be filtered through a dry <unk> pad to remove excess KH ( and resulting salts ) from the reaction . On a relatively small scale , a suspension containing a stable carbene in solution can be allowed to settle and the <unk> solution pushed through a dried membrane syringe filter . Stable carbenes are readily soluble in non @-@ polar solvents such as hexane , and so typically <unk> of stable carbenes can be difficult , due to the unavailability of suitable non @-@ acidic polar solvents . Air @-@ free sublimation as shown right can be an effective method of purification , although temperatures below 60 ° C under high vacuum are preferable as these carbenes are relatively volatile and also could begin to decompose at these higher temperatures . Indeed , sublimation in some cases can give single crystals suitable for X @-@ ray analysis . However , strong complexation to metal ions like lithium will in most cases prevent sublimation . 
 = Traumatic brain injury = 
 Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , also known as intracranial injury , occurs when an external force traumatically injures the brain . TBI can be classified based on severity , mechanism ( closed or penetrating head injury ) , or other features ( e.g. , occurring in a specific location or over a widespread area ) . Head injury usually refers to TBI , but is a broader category because it can involve damage to structures other than the brain , such as the scalp and skull . 
 TBI is a major cause of death and disability worldwide , especially in children and young adults . Males sustain traumatic brain injuries more frequently than do females . Causes include falls , vehicle accidents , and violence . Prevention measures include use of technology to protect those suffering from automobile accidents , such as seat belts and sports or motorcycle helmets , as well as efforts to reduce the number of automobile accidents , such as safety education programs and enforcement of traffic laws . 
 Brain trauma can occur as a consequence of a focal impact upon the head , by a sudden acceleration / deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact . In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury , brain trauma causes secondary injury , a variety of events that take place in the minutes and days following the injury . These processes , which include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull , contribute substantially to the damage from the initial injury . 
 TBI can cause a host of physical , cognitive , social , emotional , and behavioral effects , and outcome can range from complete recovery to permanent disability or death . The 20th century saw critical developments in diagnosis and treatment that decreased death rates and improved outcome . Some of the current imaging techniques used for diagnosis and treatment include computed tomography and MRIs ( magnetic resonance imaging ) . Depending on the injury , treatment required may be minimal or may include interventions such as medications , emergency surgery or surgery years later . Physical therapy , speech therapy , recreation therapy , occupational therapy and vision therapy may be employed for rehabilitation . Counseling , supported employment , and community support services may also be useful . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Traumatic brain injury is defined as damage to the brain resulting from external mechanical force , such as rapid acceleration or deceleration , impact , blast waves , or penetration by a projectile . Brain function is temporarily or permanently impaired and structural damage may or may not be detectable with current technology . 
 TBI is one of two subsets of acquired brain injury ( brain damage that occur after birth ) ; the other subset is non @-@ traumatic brain injury , which does not involve external mechanical force ( examples include stroke and infection ) . All traumatic brain injuries are head injuries , but the latter term may also refer to injury to other parts of the head . However , the terms head injury and brain injury are often used interchangeably . Similarly , brain injuries fall under the classification of central nervous system injuries and <unk> . In neuropsychology research literature , in general the term " traumatic brain injury " is used to refer to non @-@ penetrating traumatic brain injuries . 
 TBI is usually classified based on severity , anatomical features of the injury , and the mechanism ( the causative forces ) . Mechanism @-@ related classification divides TBI into closed and penetrating head injury . A closed ( also called nonpenetrating , or blunt ) injury occurs when the brain is not exposed . A penetrating , or open , head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater , the outermost membrane surrounding the brain . 
 = = = Severity = = = 
 Brain injuries can be classified into mild , moderate , and severe categories . The Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) , the most commonly used system for classifying TBI severity , grades a person 's level of consciousness on a scale of 3 – 15 based on verbal , motor , and eye @-@ opening reactions to stimuli . In general , it is agreed that a TBI with a GCS of 13 or above is mild , 9 – 12 is moderate , and 8 or below is severe . Similar systems exist for young children . However , the GCS grading system has limited ability to predict outcomes . Because of this , other classification systems such as the one shown in the table are also used to help determine severity . A current model developed by the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs uses all three criteria of GCS after resuscitation , duration of post @-@ traumatic amnesia ( PTA ) , and loss of consciousness ( LOC ) . It also has been proposed to use changes that are visible on neuroimaging , such as swelling , focal lesions , or diffuse injury as method of classification . Grading scales also exist to classify the severity of mild TBI , commonly called concussion ; these use duration of LOC , PTA , and other concussion symptoms . 
 = = = Pathological features = = = 
 Systems also exist to classify TBI by its pathological features . Lesions can be extra @-@ axial , ( occurring within the skull but outside of the brain ) or intra @-@ axial ( occurring within the brain tissue ) . Damage from TBI can be focal or diffuse , confined to specific areas or distributed in a more general manner , respectively . However , it is common for both types of injury to exist in a given case . 
 Diffuse injury manifests with little apparent damage in neuroimaging studies , but lesions can be seen with microscopy techniques post @-@ mortem , and in the early 2000s , researchers discovered that diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , a way of processing MRI images that shows white matter tracts , was an effective tool for displaying the extent of diffuse axonal injury . Types of injuries considered diffuse include edema ( swelling ) and diffuse axonal injury , which is widespread damage to axons including white matter tracts and projections to the cortex . Types of injuries considered diffuse include concussion and diffuse axonal injury , widespread damage to axons in areas including white matter and the cerebral hemispheres . 
 Focal injuries often produce symptoms related to the functions of the damaged area . Research shows that the most common areas to have focal lesions in non @-@ penetrating traumatic brain injury are the orbitofrontal cortex ( the lower surface of the frontal lobes ) and the anterior temporal lobes , areas that are involved in social behavior , emotion regulation , olfaction , and decision @-@ making , hence the common social / emotional and judgment deficits following moderate @-@ severe TBI . Symptoms such as <unk> or aphasia can also occur when less commonly affected areas such as motor or language areas are , respectively , damaged . 
 One type of focal injury , cerebral laceration , occurs when the tissue is cut or torn . Such tearing is common in orbitofrontal cortex in particular , because of bony protrusions on the interior skull ridge above the eyes . In a similar injury , cerebral contusion ( bruising of brain tissue ) , blood is mixed among tissue . In contrast , intracranial hemorrhage involves bleeding that is not mixed with tissue . 
 <unk> , also focal lesions , are collections of blood in or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage . <unk> hemorrhage , with bleeding in the brain tissue itself , is an intra @-@ axial lesion . Extra @-@ axial lesions include epidural hematoma , subdural hematoma , subarachnoid hemorrhage , and intraventricular hemorrhage . Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater , the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain . In subdural hematoma , bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater . Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into the space between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater . <unk> hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Symptoms are dependent on the type of TBI ( diffuse or focal ) and the part of the brain that is affected . <unk> tends to last longer for people with injuries on the left side of the brain than for those with injuries on the right . Symptoms are also dependent on the injury 's severity . With mild TBI , the patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes . Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache , vomiting , nausea , lack of motor coordination , dizziness , difficulty balancing , lightheadedness , blurred vision or tired eyes , ringing in the ears , bad taste in the mouth , fatigue or lethargy , and changes in sleep patterns . Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes , confusion , and trouble with memory , concentration , attention , or thinking . Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries . 
 A person with a moderate or severe TBI may have a headache that does not go away , repeated vomiting or nausea , convulsions , an inability to awaken , dilation of one or both pupils , slurred speech , aphasia ( word @-@ finding difficulties ) , dysarthria ( muscle weakness that causes disordered speech ) , weakness or numbness in the limbs , loss of coordination , confusion , restlessness , or agitation . Common long @-@ term symptoms of moderate to severe TBI are changes in appropriate social behavior , deficits in social judgment , and cognitive changes , especially problems with sustained attention , processing speed , and executive functioning . <unk> , a deficiency in identifying , understanding , processing , and describing emotions occurs in 60 @.@ 9 % of individuals with TBI . Cognitive and social deficits have long @-@ term consequences for the daily lives of people with moderate to severe TBI , but can be improved with appropriate rehabilitation . 
 When the pressure within the skull ( intracranial pressure , abbreviated ICP ) rises too high , it can be deadly . Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness , paralysis or weakness on one side of the body , and a blown pupil , one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so . Cushing 's triad , a slow heart rate with high blood pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP . <unk> , unequal pupil size , is another sign of serious TBI . Abnormal posturing , a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP , is an ominous sign . 
 Small children with moderate to severe TBI may have some of these symptoms but have difficulty communicating them . Other signs seen in young children include persistent crying , inability to be consoled , listlessness , refusal to nurse or eat , and irritability . 
 = = Causes = = 
 The most common causes of TBI in the U.S. include violence , transportation accidents , construction , and sports . Motor bikes are major causes , increasing in significance in developing countries as other causes reduce . The estimates that between 1 @.@ 6 and 3 @.@ 8 million traumatic brain injuries each year are a result of sports and recreation activities in the US . In children aged two to four , falls are the most common cause of TBI , while in older children traffic accidents compete with falls for this position . TBI is the third most common injury to result from child abuse . Abuse causes 19 % of cases of pediatric brain trauma , and the death rate is higher among these cases . Although men are twice as likely to have a TBI . Domestic violence is another cause of TBI , as are work @-@ related and industrial accidents . Firearms and blast injuries from explosions are other causes of TBI , which is the leading cause of death and disability in war zones . According to Representative Bill Pascrell ( Democrat , NJ ) , TBI is " the signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . " There is a promising technology called activation database @-@ guided EEG biofeedback , which has been documented to return a TBI 's auditory memory ability to above the control group 's performance 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 = = = Physical forces = = = 
 The type , direction , intensity , and duration of forces all contribute to the characteristics and severity TBI . Forces that may contribute to TBI include angular , rotational , shear , and translational forces . 
 Even in the absence of an impact , significant acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause TBI ; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame . Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something , termed contact or impact loading , are the cause of most focal injuries , and movement of the brain within the skull , termed <unk> or inertial loading , usually causes diffuse injuries . The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury . In impact loading , the force sends shock waves through the skull and brain , resulting in tissue damage . Shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along the path of a projectile , compounding the damage caused by the missile itself . 
 Damage may occur directly under the site of impact , or it may occur on the side opposite the impact ( coup and contrecoup injury , respectively ) . When a moving object impacts the stationary head , coup injuries are typical , while contrecoup injuries are usually produced when the moving head strikes a stationary object . 
 = = = Primary and secondary injury = = = 
 A large percentage of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event ; rather than improving after being hospitalized , some 40 % of TBI patients deteriorate . Primary brain injury ( the damage that occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched , compressed , and torn ) is not adequate to explain this deterioration ; rather , it is caused by secondary injury , a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma . These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals . 
 Secondary injury events include damage to the blood – brain barrier , release of factors that cause inflammation , free radical overload , excessive release of the neurotransmitter glutamate ( excitotoxicity ) , influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons , and dysfunction of mitochondria . Injured axons in the brain 's white matter may separate from their cell bodies as a result of secondary injury , potentially killing those neurons . Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the blood flow to the brain ; ischemia ( insufficient blood flow ) ; cerebral hypoxia ( insufficient oxygen in the brain ) ; cerebral edema ( swelling of the brain ) ; and raised intracranial pressure ( the pressure within the skull ) . Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion , such as a hemorrhage . As a result , cerebral perfusion pressure ( the pressure of blood flow in the brain ) is reduced ; ischemia results . When the pressure within the skull rises too high , it can cause brain death or herniation , in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull . A particularly weak part of the skull that is vulnerable to damage causing <unk> haematoma is the pterion , deep in which lies the middle meningeal artery , which is easily damaged in fractures of the pterion . Since the pterion is so weak , this type of injury can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma to other parts of the skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Diagnosis is suspected based on lesion circumstances and clinical evidence , most prominently a neurological examination , for example checking whether the pupils constrict normally in response to light and assigning a Glasgow Coma Score . Neuroimaging helps in determining the diagnosis and prognosis and in deciding what treatments to give . 
 The preferred radiologic test in the emergency setting is computed tomography ( CT ) : it is quick , accurate , and widely available . Follow @-@ up CT scans may be performed later to determine whether the injury has progressed . 
 Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) can show more detail than CT , and can add information about expected outcome in the long term . It is more useful than CT for detecting injury characteristics such as diffuse axonal injury in the longer term . However , MRI is not used in the emergency setting for reasons including its relative inefficacy in detecting bleeds and fractures , its lengthy acquisition of images , the inaccessibility of the patient in the machine , and its incompatibility with metal items used in emergency care . A variant of MRI since 2012 is High definition fiber tracking ( <unk> ) . 
 Other techniques may be used to confirm a particular diagnosis . X @-@ rays are still used for head trauma , but evidence suggests they are not useful ; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or severe enough to merit the more accurate CT . Angiography may be used to detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved . Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism , inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome . Electroencephalography and transcranial doppler may also be used . The most sensitive physical measure to date is the quantitative EEG , which has documented an 80 % to 100 % ability in discriminating between normal and traumatic brain @-@ injured subjects . 
 Neuropsychological assessment can be performed to evaluate the long @-@ term cognitive sequelae and to aid in the planning of the rehabilitation . Instruments range from short measures of general mental functioning to complete batteries formed of different domain @-@ specific tests . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Since a major cause of TBI are vehicle accidents , their prevention or the amelioration of their consequences can both reduce the incidence and gravity of TBI . In accidents , damage can be reduced by use of seat belts , child safety seats and motorcycle helmets , and presence of roll bars and airbags . Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes . In addition , changes to public policy and safety laws can be made ; these include speed limits , seat belt and helmet laws , and road engineering practices . 
 Changes to common practices in sports have also been discussed . An increase in use of helmets could reduce the incidence of TBI . Due to the possibility that repeatedly " heading " a ball practicing soccer could cause cumulative brain injury , the idea of introducing protective headgear for players has been proposed . Improved equipment design can enhance safety ; softer baseballs reduce head injury risk . Rules against dangerous types of contact , such as " spear tackling " in American football , when one player tackles another head first , may also reduce head injury rates . 
 Falls can be avoided by installing grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways ; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs ; or installing window guards and safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs around young children . Playgrounds with shock @-@ absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries . Child abuse prevention is another tactic ; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children . Gun safety , including keeping guns unloaded and locked , is another preventative measure . Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries . 
 Recent clinical and laboratory research by neurosurgeon Julian <unk> , M.D. , and his colleagues from West Virginia University , has resulted in papers showing that dietary supplementation with omega @-@ 3 DHA offers protection against the biochemical brain damage that occurs after a traumatic injury . Rats given DHA prior to induced brain injuries suffered smaller increases in two key markers for brain damage ( APP and caspase @-@ 3 ) , as compared with rats given no DHA . “ The potential for DHA to provide prophylactic benefit to the brain against traumatic injury appears promising and requires further investigation . The essential concept of daily dietary supplementation with DHA , so that those at significant risk may be preloaded to provide protection against the acute effects of TBI , has tremendous public health implications . ” 
 Furthermore , acetylcysteine has been confirmed , in a recent double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trial conducted by the US military , to reduce the effects of blast induced mild traumatic brain and neurological injury in soldiers . Multiple animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury , and also ischemia @-@ induced brain injury . In particular , it has been demonstrated through multiple studies to significantly reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these traumatic events . Acetylcysteine has been safely used to treat paracetamol overdose for over forty years and is extensively used in emergency medicine . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 It is important to begin emergency treatment within the so @-@ called " golden hour " following the injury . People with moderate to severe injuries are likely to receive treatment in an intensive care unit followed by a neurosurgical ward . Treatment depends on the recovery stage of the patient . In the acute stage the primary aim of the medical personnel is to stabilize the patient and focus on preventing further injury because little can be done to reverse the initial damage caused by trauma . Rehabilitation is the main treatment for the subacute and chronic stages of recovery . International clinical guidelines have been proposed with the aim of guiding decisions in TBI treatment , as defined by an authoritative examination of current evidence . 
 = = = Acute stage = = = 
 Certain facilities are equipped to handle TBI better than others ; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center . Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply , maintaining adequate blood flow to the brain , and controlling raised intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation . Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures . Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes . 
 Neuroimaging is helpful but not flawless in detecting raised ICP . A more accurate way to measure ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain , which has the added benefit of allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain , releasing pressure in the skull . Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient 's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck . <unk> , analgesics and paralytic agents are often used . <unk> saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water ( swelling ) , though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure . <unk> , an osmotic diuretic , appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP . Some concerns ; however , have been raised regarding some of the studies performed . Diuretics , drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system , may be used to treat high intracranial pressures , but may cause hypovolemia ( insufficient blood volume ) . <unk> ( larger and / or faster breaths ) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict ; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP , but it potentially causes ischemia and is , therefore , used only in the short term . Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death , and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely . 
 <unk> intubation and mechanical ventilation may be used to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway . Hypotension ( low blood pressure ) , which has a devastating outcome in TBI , can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure . Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain . Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs ; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion . Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain 's metabolic needs , potentially depriving it of nutrients . Seizures are common . While they can be treated with benzodiazepines , these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure . TBI patients are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely or be inordinately sensitive to some pharmacological agents . During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness . 
 Traumatic brain injury may cause a range of serious coincidental complications that include cardiac arrhythmias and neurogenic pulmonary edema . These conditions must be adequately treated and stabilised as part of the core care for these patients . 
 Surgery can be performed on mass lesions or to eliminate objects that have penetrated the brain . Mass lesions such as contusions or hematomas causing a significant mass effect ( shift of intracranial structures ) are considered emergencies and are removed surgically . For intracranial hematomas , the collected blood may be removed using suction or forceps or it may be floated off with water . Surgeons look for hemorrhaging blood vessels and seek to control bleeding . In penetrating brain injury , damaged tissue is surgically <unk> , and craniotomy may be needed . <unk> , in which part of the skull is removed , may be needed to remove pieces of fractured skull or objects embedded in the brain . <unk> craniectomy ( DC ) is performed routinely in the very short period following TBI during operations to treat hematomas ; part of the skull is removed temporarily ( primary DC ) . DC performed hours or days after TBI in order to control high intracranial pressures ( secondary DC ) has not been shown to improve outcome in some trials and may be associated with severe side @-@ effects . 
 = = = Chronic stage = = = 
 Once medically stable , people may be transferred to a subacute rehabilitation unit of the medical center or to an independent rehabilitation hospital . Rehabilitation aims to improve independent function at home and in society and to help adapt to disabilities and has demonstrated its general effectiveness , when conducted by a team of health professionals who specialise in head trauma . As for any person with neurologic deficits , a multidisciplinary approach is key to optimising outcome . <unk> or neurologists are likely to be the key medical staff involved , but depending on the person , doctors of other medical specialties may also be helpful . Allied health professions such as physiotherapy , speech and language therapy , cognitive rehabilitation therapy , and occupational therapy will be essential to assess function and design the rehabilitation activities for each person . Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional distress and clinical depression may involve mental health professionals such as therapists , psychologists , and psychiatrists , while neuropsychologists can help to evaluate and manage cognitive deficits . 
 After discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation treatment unit , care may be given on an outpatient basis . Community @-@ based rehabilitation will be required for a high proportion of people , including vocational rehabilitation ; this supportive employment matches job demands to the worker 's abilities . People with TBI who cannot live independently or with family may require care in supported living facilities such as group homes . Respite care , including day centers and leisure facilities for the disabled , offers time off for caregivers , and activities for people with TBI . 
 Pharmacological treatment can help to manage psychiatric or behavioral problems . Medication is also used to control post @-@ traumatic epilepsy ; however the preventive use of anti @-@ epileptics is not recommended . In those cases where the person is bedridden due to a reduction of consciousness , has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems , or has any other problem heavily impacting self @-@ caring capacities , caregiving and nursing are critical . The most effective research documented intervention approach is the activation database guided EEG biofeedback approach , which has shown significant improvements in memory abilities of the TBI subject that are far superior than traditional approaches ( strategies , computers , medication intervention ) . Gains of 2 @.@ 61 standard deviations have been documented . The TBI 's auditory memory ability was superior to the control group after the treatment . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Prognosis worsens with the severity of injury . Most TBIs are mild and do not cause permanent or long @-@ term disability ; however , all severity levels of TBI have the potential to cause significant , long @-@ lasting disability . Permanent disability is thought to occur in 10 % of mild injuries , 66 % of moderate injuries , and 100 % of severe injuries . Most mild TBI is completely resolved within three weeks , and almost all people with mild TBI are able to live independently and return to the jobs they had before the injury , although a portion have mild cognitive and social impairments . Over 90 % of people with moderate TBI are able to live independently , although a portion require assistance in areas such as physical abilities , employment , and financial managing . Most people with severe closed head injury either die or recover enough to live independently ; middle ground is less common . Coma , as it is closely related to severity , is a strong predictor of poor outcome . 
 Prognosis differs depending on the severity and location of the lesion , and access to immediate , specialised acute management . Subarachnoid hemorrhage approximately doubles mortality . <unk> hematoma is associated with worse outcome and increased mortality , while people with epidural hematoma are expected to have a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly . Diffuse axonal injury may be associated with coma when severe , and poor outcome . Following the acute stage , prognosis is strongly influenced by the patient 's involvement in activity that promote recovery , which for most patients requires access to a specialised , intensive rehabilitation service . The Functional Independence Measure is a way to track progress and degree of independence throughout rehabilitation . 
 Medical complications are associated with a bad prognosis . Examples are hypotension ( low blood pressure ) , hypoxia ( low blood oxygen saturation ) , lower cerebral perfusion pressures and longer times spent with high intracranial pressures . Patient characteristics also influence prognosis . Factors thought to worsen it include abuse of substances such as illicit drugs and alcohol and age over sixty or under two years ( in children , younger age at time of injury may be associated with a slower recovery of some abilities ) . Other influences that may affect recovery include pre @-@ injury intellectual ability , coping strategies , personality traits , family environment , social support systems and financial circumstances . 
 Life satisfaction has been known to decrease for individuals with TBI immediately following the trauma , but evidence has shown that life roles , age , and depressive symptoms influence the trajectory of life satisfaction as time passes . 
 = = Complications = = 
 Improvement of neurological function usually occurs for two or more years after the trauma . For many years it was believed that recovery was fastest during the first six months , but there is no evidence to support this . It may be related to services commonly being withdrawn after this period , rather than any physiological limitation to further progress . Children recover better in the immediate time frame and improve for longer periods . 
 Complications are distinct medical problems that may arise as a result of the TBI . The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration ; they include physical , cognitive , emotional , and behavioral complications . TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness , such as coma , brain death , persistent vegetative state ( in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings ) , and minimally conscious state ( in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment ) . Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores , pneumonia or other infections , progressive multiple organ failure , and deep venous thrombosis , which can cause pulmonary embolism . Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses . Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm , in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow , the formation of aneurysms , in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out , and stroke . 
 Movement disorders that may develop after TBI include tremor , ataxia ( uncoordinated muscle movements ) , myoclonus ( shock @-@ like contractions of muscles ) , and loss of movement range and control ( in particular with a loss of movement repertoire ) . The risk of post @-@ traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma ( image at right ) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas . People with early seizures , those occurring within a week of injury , have an increased risk of post @-@ traumatic epilepsy ( recurrent seizures occurring more than a week after the initial trauma ) . People may lose or experience altered vision , hearing , or smell . 
 Hormonal disturbances may occur secondary to hypopituitarism , occurring immediately or years after injury in 10 to 15 % of TBI patients . Development of diabetes insipidus or an electrolyte abnormality acutely after injury indicate need for <unk> work up . Signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism may develop and be screened for in adults with moderate TBI and in mild TBI with imaging abnormalities . Children with moderate to severe head injury may also develop hypopituitarism . Screening should take place 3 to 6 months , and 12 months after injury , but problems may occur more remotely . 
 Cognitive deficits that can follow TBI include impaired attention ; disrupted insight , judgement , and thought ; reduced processing speed ; distractibility ; and deficits in executive functions such as abstract reasoning , planning , problem @-@ solving , and multitasking . Memory loss , the most common cognitive impairment among head @-@ injured people , occurs in 20 – 79 % of people with closed head trauma , depending on severity . People who have suffered TBI may also have difficulty with understanding or producing spoken or written language , or with more subtle aspects of communication such as body language . Post @-@ concussion syndrome , a set of lasting symptoms experienced after mild TBI , can include physical , cognitive , emotional and behavioral problems such as headaches , dizziness , difficulty concentrating , and depression . Multiple TBIs may have a cumulative effect . A young person who receives a second concussion before symptoms from another one have healed may be at risk for developing a very rare but deadly condition called second @-@ impact syndrome , in which the brain swells catastrophically after even a mild blow , with debilitating or deadly results . About one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury ( <unk> ) , which causes cognitive , behavioral , and physical impairments . Dementia <unk> , the severe form of <unk> , affects primarily career boxers years after a boxing career . It commonly manifests as dementia , memory problems , and parkinsonism ( tremors and lack of coordination ) . 
 TBI may cause emotional , social , or behavioral problems and changes in personality . These may include emotional instability , depression , anxiety , hypomania , mania , apathy , irritability , problems with social judgment , and impaired conversational skills . TBI appears to predispose survivors to psychiatric disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder , substance abuse , dysthymia , clinical depression , bipolar disorder , and anxiety disorders . In patients who have depression after TBI , suicidal ideation is not uncommon ; the suicide rate among these persons is increased 2- to 3 @-@ fold . Social and behavioral symptoms that can follow TBI include disinhibition , inability to control anger , impulsiveness , lack of initiative , inappropriate sexual activity , <unk> and social withdrawal , and changes in personality . 
 TBI also has a substantial impact on the functioning of family systems Caregiving family members and TBI survivors often significantly alter their familial roles and responsibilities following injury , creating significant change and strain on a family system . Typical challenges identified by families recovering from TBI include : frustration and impatience with one another , loss of former lives and relationships , difficulty setting reasonable goals , inability to effectively solve problems as a family , increased level of stress and household tension , changes in emotional dynamics , and overwhelming desire to return to pre @-@ injury status . In addition , families may exhibit less effective functioning in areas including coping , problem solving and communication . <unk> and counseling models have been demonstrated to be effective in minimizing family disruption 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 TBI is a leading cause of death and disability around the globe and presents a major worldwide social , economic , and health problem . It is the number one cause of coma , it plays the leading role in disability due to trauma , and is the leading cause of brain damage in children and young adults . In Europe it is responsible for more years of disability than any other cause . It also plays a significant role in half of trauma deaths . 
 Findings on the frequency of each level of severity vary based on the definitions and methods used in studies . A World Health Organization study estimated that between 70 and 90 % of head injuries that receive treatment are mild , and a US study found that moderate and severe injuries each account for 10 % of TBIs , with the rest mild . 
 The incidence of TBI varies by age , gender , region and other factors . Findings of incidence and prevalence in epidemiological studies vary based on such factors as which grades of severity are included , whether deaths are included , whether the study is restricted to hospitalized people , and the study 's location . The annual incidence of mild TBI is difficult to determine but may be 100 – 600 people per 100 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Mortality = = = 
 In the US , the case fatality rate is estimated to be 21 % by 30 days after TBI . A study on Iraq War soldiers found that severe TBI carries a mortality of 30 – 50 % . Deaths have declined due to improved treatments and systems for managing trauma in societies wealthy enough to provide modern emergency and neurosurgical services . The fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with TBI fell from almost half in the 1970s to about a quarter at the beginning of the 21st century . This decline in mortality has led to a concomitant increase in the number of people living with disabilities that result from TBI . 
 Biological , clinical , and demographic factors contribute to the likelihood that an injury will be fatal . In addition , outcome depends heavily on the cause of head injury . In the US , patients with fall @-@ related TBIs have an 89 % survival rate , while only 9 % of patients with firearm @-@ related TBIs survive . In the US , firearms are the most common cause of fatal TBI , followed by vehicle accidents and then falls . Of deaths from firearms , 75 % are considered to be suicides . 
 The incidence of TBI is increasing globally , due largely to an increase in motor vehicle use in low- and middle @-@ income countries . In developing countries , automobile use has increased faster than safety infrastructure could be introduced . In contrast , vehicle safety laws have decreased rates of TBI in high @-@ income countries , which have seen decreases in traffic @-@ related TBI since the 1970s . Each year in the United States , about two million people suffer a TBI , approximately 675 @,@ 000 injuries are seen in the emergency department , and about 500 @,@ 000 patients are hospitalized . The yearly incidence of TBI is estimated at 180 – 250 per 100 @,@ 000 people in the US , 281 per 100 @,@ 000 in France , 361 per 100 @,@ 000 in South Africa , 322 per 100 @,@ 000 in Australia , and 430 per 100 @,@ 000 in England . In the European Union the yearly aggregate incidence of TBI hospitalizations and fatalities is estimated at 235 per 100 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Demographics = = = 
 TBI is present in 85 % of traumatically injured children , either alone or with other injuries . The greatest number of TBIs occur in people aged 15 – 24 . Because TBI is more common in young people , its costs to society are high due to the loss of productive years to death and disability . The age groups most at risk for TBI are children ages five to nine and adults over age 80 , and the highest rates of death and hospitalization due to TBI are in people over age 65 . The incidence of fall @-@ related TBI in First @-@ World countries is increasing as the population ages ; thus the median age of people with head injuries has increased . 
 Regardless of age , TBI rates are higher in males . Men suffer twice as many TBIs as women do and have a fourfold risk of fatal head injury , and males account for two thirds of childhood and adolescent head trauma . However , when matched for severity of injury , women appear to fare more poorly than men . 
 Socioeconomic status also appears to affect TBI rates ; people with lower levels of education and employment and lower socioeconomic status are at greater risk . 
 = = History = = 
 Head injury is present in ancient myths that may date back before recorded history . Skulls found in battleground graves with holes drilled over fracture lines suggest that trepanation may have been used to treat TBI in ancient times . Ancient Mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects , including seizures , paralysis , and loss of sight , hearing or speech . The Edwin Smith Papyrus , written around 1650 – 1550 BC , describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and <unk> . Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood the brain to be the center of thought , probably due to their experience with head trauma . 
 Medieval and Renaissance surgeons continued the practice of trepanation for head injury . In the Middle Ages , physicians further described head injury symptoms and the term concussion became more widespread . Concussion symptoms were first described systematically in the 16th century by <unk> da Carpi . 
 It was first suggested in the 18th century that intracranial pressure rather than skull damage was the cause of pathology after TBI . This hypothesis was confirmed around the end of the 19th century , and opening the skull to relieve pressure was then proposed as a treatment . 
 In the 19th century it was noted that TBI is related to the development of psychosis . At that time a debate arose around whether post @-@ concussion syndrome was due to a disturbance of the brain tissue or psychological factors . The debate continues today . 
 Perhaps the first reported case of personality change after brain injury is that of Phineas Gage , who survived an accident in which a large iron rod was driven through his head , destroying one or both of his frontal lobes ; numerous cases of personality change after brain injury have been reported since . 
 The 20th century saw the advancement of technologies that improved treatment and diagnosis such as the development of imaging tools including CT and MRI , and , in the 21st century , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . The introduction of intracranial pressure monitoring in the 1950s has been credited with beginning the " modern era " of head injury . Until the 20th century , the mortality rate of TBI was high and rehabilitation was uncommon ; improvements in care made during World War I reduced the death rate and made rehabilitation possible . Facilities dedicated to TBI rehabilitation were probably first established during World War I. Explosives used in World War I caused many blast injuries ; the large number of TBIs that resulted allowed researchers to learn about localization of brain functions . Blast @-@ related injuries are now common problems in returning veterans from Iraq & Afghanistan ; research shows that the symptoms of such TBIs are largely the same as those of TBIs involving a physical blow to the head . 
 In the 1970s , awareness of TBI as a public health problem grew , and a great deal of progress has been made since then in brain trauma research , such as the discovery of primary and secondary brain injury . The 1990s saw the development and dissemination of standardized guidelines for treatment of TBI , with protocols for a range of issues such as drugs and management of intracranial pressure . Research since the early 1990s has improved TBI survival ; that decade was known as the " Decade of the Brain " for advances made in brain research . 
 = = Research = = 
 = = = Medications = = = 
 Topics of research for improving outcome after TBI have included investigations into mannitol , dexamethasone , progesterone , xenon , barbiturates , magnesium , calcium channel blockers , <unk> @-@ γ agonists , <unk> , ethanol , NMDA antagonists , caffeine , hypothermia , and hyperbaric oxygen . 
 Despite this volume of research , no medication is approved to halt the progression of the initial injury to secondary injury , but the variety of pathological events presents opportunities to find treatments that interfere with the damage processes . <unk> , methods to halt or mitigate secondary injury , have been the subject of great interest for their ability to limit the damage that follows TBI . However , clinical trials to test agents that could halt these cellular mechanisms have met largely with failure . For example , interest existed in hypothermia , cooling the injured brain to limit TBI damage , but it has not been sufficiently studied as of 2014 to see if it is useful or not . In addition , drugs such as NMDA receptor antagonists to halt neurochemical cascades such as excitotoxicity showed promise in animal trials but failed in clinical trials . These failures could be due to factors including faults in the trials ' design or in the insufficiency of a single agent to prevent the array of injury processes involved in secondary injury . 
 = = = Procedures = = = 
 In addition to traditional imaging modalities , there are several devices that help to monitor brain injury and facilitate research . <unk> allows ongoing sampling of extracellular fluid for analysis of metabolites that might indicate ischemia or brain metabolism , such as glucose , glycerol , and glutamate . <unk> brain tissue oxygen monitoring systems ( either <unk> or <unk> @-@ PTO ) are used routinely in <unk> care in the US . A non invasive model called <unk> is in development . 
 Research is also planned to clarify factors correlated to outcome in TBI and to determine in which cases it is best to perform CT scans and surgical procedures . 
 Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBO ) has been evaluated as an adjunctive treatment following TBI , concluding a Cochrane review stating that its use could not be justified . HBO for TBI has remained controversial as studies have looked for improvement mechanisms , and further evidence shows that it may have potential as a treatment . 
 = = = Psychological = = = 
 As of 2010 , the use of predictive visual tracking measurement to identify mild traumatic brain injury was being studied . In visual tracking tests , a head @-@ mounted display unit with eye @-@ tracking capability shows an object moving in a regular pattern . People without brain injury are able to track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory . The test requires both attention and working memory which are difficult functions for people with mild traumatic brain injury . The question being studied , is whether results for people with brain injury will show visual @-@ tracking gaze errors relative to the moving target . 
 = Typhoon Maemi = 
 Typhoon Maemi , known in the Philippines as Typhoon <unk> , was the most powerful typhoon to strike South Korea since record @-@ keeping began in the country in 1904 . Maemi formed on September 4 , 2003 from a disturbance in a monsoon trough in the western Pacific Ocean . It slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Maemi while moving northwestward , becoming a typhoon on September 8 . That day , favorable conditions facilitated more rapid strengthening ; the storm developed a well @-@ defined eye and reached peak maximum sustained winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) . While near peak intensity , Maemi decelerated and began turning to the north @-@ northeast . Soon after , the eyewall passed over the Japanese island of Miyako @-@ jima on September 10 and produced an air pressure reading of 912 mbar ( 26 @.@ 9 inHg ) , the fourth @-@ lowest recorded in the nation . Due to warm waters , Maemi was able to maintain much of its intensity before it made landfall just west of Busan , South Korea , on September 12 . The typhoon became extratropical in the Sea of Japan the next day , although its remnants persisted for several days , lashing northern Japan with strong winds . 
 The typhoon first affected the Ryukyu Islands of Japan . On Miyako @-@ jima , strong winds damaged 104 buildings and left 95 % of residents without power . Maemi caused heavy rainfall there , with rates of 58 @.@ 5 mm ( 2 @.@ 30 in ) in an hour and 402 @.@ 5 mm ( 15 @.@ 85 in ) in 24 hours , the latter setting a record . One person died on Miyako @-@ jima after being struck by airborne debris . Elsewhere in Japan , the storm caused flights to be canceled , and rainfall @-@ induced landslides blocked roads . There were two other deaths in Japan , and damage totaled ¥ 11 @.@ 3 billion yen ( JPY , $ 96 million USD ) . Damage was heaviest in South Korea , particularly where it moved ashore . On Jeju Island , Maemi produced a peak wind gust of 216 km / h ( 134 mph ) and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar ( 28 inHg ) , both setting records for the country ; the pressure reading broke the longstanding lowest pressure set by Typhoon Sarah in 1959 . Winds in Busan near the landfall location reached 154 km / h ( 96 mph ) , the second @-@ highest on record . The port there sustained heavy damage , restricting exports in the months following the storm . Nationwide , the high winds destroyed about 5 @,@ 000 houses and damaged 13 @,@ 000 homes and businesses , leaving 25 @,@ 000 people homeless . About 1 @.@ 47 million households lost power , and widespread crop damage occurred , resulting in the poorest rice harvest in 23 years . Across South Korea , Maemi killed 117 people , and overall damage totaled ₩ 5 @.@ 52 trillion won ( KRW , $ 4 @.@ 8 billion USD ) .

 In early September 2003 , a monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance near Guam . The system consisted of a disorganized area of convection , or thunderstorms , in an area of moderate wind shear . By September 4 , the convection was becoming better organized around a weak low @-@ level circulation . Despite the wind shear , the system continued to develop , becoming a tropical depression north of Chuuk State . At 0200 UTC on September 5 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert , and later that day initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 15W just west of Guam . By that time , the convection had increased over the center . For the first week of its existence , the cyclone tracked generally northwestward , steered by a subtropical ridge to the north . 
 Early on September 6 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and named it Maemi . With more favorable conditions , including lesser wind shear and enhanced outflow , the storm continued to intensify . The JMA upgraded Maemi to a severe tropical storm on September 7 and to typhoon status – winds of over 119 km / h ( 74 mph ) – the next day . The JTWC had upgraded Maemi to typhoon status on September 7 after an eye feature appeared on satellite imagery . Also around that time , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) began issuing advisories on the storm , giving it the local name " <unk> " , although the typhoon would remain away from the country . On September 8 , Maemi began undergoing rapid deepening due to enhanced outflow , aided by the flow of an approaching shortwave trough . At 1200 UTC on September 9 , the JTWC estimated 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) and designated Maemi as a super typhoon . The next day , the same agency estimated peak winds of 280 km / h ( 175 mph ) and gusts to 335 km / h ( 205 mph ) , the equivalent of a Category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . At 1200 UTC on September 10 , the JMA estimated peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 910 mbar ( 27 inHg ) while the storm was 155 km ( 100 mi ) southeast of the Japanese island of Miyako @-@ jima . At peak intensity , Maemi was a small typhoon , with gale @-@ force winds extending only 240 km ( 150 mi ) from the well @-@ defined eye . 
 Around the time of peak intensity , Maemi was slowing its forward motion and began turning to the north , after the eastward @-@ moving trough weakened the ridge . At 1900 UTC on September 10 , the typhoon passed within 10 km ( 7 mi ) of Miyako @-@ jima . While the eye was passing over the island , the pressure fell to 912 mbar ( 26 @.@ 9 inHg ) and winds reached 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) . Maemi weakened slightly as it continued north , passing about 220 km ( 140 mi ) west of Okinawa on September 11 while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle . Increasingly hostile conditions from the approaching trough caused further weakening , and the JTWC estimated the typhoon passed just east of Jeju Island with 1 @-@ minute winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) at 0600 UTC on September 12 . Shortly after , Maemi made landfall just west of Busan , South Korea , with the JMA estimating 10 @-@ minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) , and JTWC estimating 1 @-@ minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . Risk Management Solutions estimated landfall winds of 190 km / h ( 120 mph ) , which surpassed Typhoon Sarah in 1959 . This made Maemi the strongest typhoon to strike the country since the Korea Meteorological Administration began keeping records in 1904 . The storm was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm sea surface temperatures and its fast forward motion . Maemi rapidly weakened to tropical storm status while moving over land , and was undergoing extratropical transition by the time it entered the Sea of Japan . Increasing wind shear removed the convection from the increasingly ill @-@ defined circulation center . The JTWC issued its final warning on Maemi early on September 13 , declaring the storm extratropical . The JMA followed suit later that day , tracking Maemi over northern Japan and declaring it extratropical over the Sea of Okhotsk . The remnants of Maemi persisted for several more days , until the JMA stopped tracking it on September 16 southwest of the Kamchatka Peninsula . According to the Mariners Weather Log , the remnants of Maemi continued to the east , eventually striking the coast of Alaska on September 21 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 In Japan , the threat of the typhoon caused airlines to cancel 145 flights , mostly in and around Okinawa . About 50 American army bases in Okinawa were closed , and non @-@ essential workers were told to remain home . 
 Before Maemi made landfall in South Korea , officials issued flood warnings along the Nakdong River due to dams opening floodgates . About 25 @,@ 000 people were forced to evacuate , either to schools or relatives ' houses . The Korea Meteorological Administration advised travelers to take precaution in advance of the storm . Ferry and airplane services were canceled to Jeju island , stranding residents ahead of the <unk> holiday . 
 Officials in Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East issued a storm warning , noting the potential for strong winds and heavy rainfall .

 Typhoon Maemi first affected the Japanese island of Miyako @-@ jima , where gusts reached 266 km / h ( 166 mph ) , and sustained winds reached 152 km / h ( 94 mph ) . For 16 hours , excluding the 2 – hour passage of the eye , the pressure fell to 912 mbar ( 26 @.@ 9 inHg ) , the second @-@ lowest on record on the island after Typhoon Sarah in 1959 , and at the time the fourth lowest in all of Japan . The typhoon produced heavy rainfall on Miyako @-@ jima totaling 470 mm ( 19 in ) , of which 402 @.@ 5 mm ( 15 @.@ 85 in ) fell in 24 hours , breaking the daily record . Also on the island , 58 @.@ 5 mm ( 2 @.@ 30 in ) fell in one hour , and 22 mm ( 0 @.@ 87 in ) fell in just 10 minutes . On the island , Maemi damaged 104 buildings , including two severely damaged houses . The storm damaged roads in 36 locations and caused a power outage , affecting about 20 @,@ 900 people , or 95 % of the island . One person on Miyako @-@ jima died after being struck by flying glass . 
 News agencies considered Maemi the strongest typhoon to affect Okinawa since 1968 . Elsewhere in Okinawa Prefecture , wind gusts reached 109 km / h ( 69 mph ) in Nago . On Ishigaki Island , strong winds damaged houses and crops , while high tides flooded low @-@ lying buildings . Across the region , 94 people were injured , mostly from broken glass . 
 Shortly before Maemi made its final landfall , it produced wind gusts of 167 km / h ( 104 mph ) at <unk> , a Japanese island halfway between South Korea and Japan . Along the southwest coast of Japan , a weather station in Hirado reported gusts of 113 km / h ( 70 mph ) . The typhoon resulted in heavy rainfall on the Japanese main island of Kyushu , reaching 457 mm ( 18 @.@ 0 in ) at a station in Miyazaki Prefecture . Rainfall @-@ induced landslides in Nagasaki forced 191 people to evacuate their homes . Heavy rainfall also caused landslides in Ōita Prefecture , and Kōchi Prefecture , where several roads were closed . The threat of the storm caused schools to close in Yamaguchi Prefecture . The storm spawned an F1 tornado in Kōchi that damaged several houses and flipped over a car , injuring a woman inside . As an extratropical storm , Maemi left 2 @,@ 500 people in Hokkaido without power after producing gusts of 108 km / h ( 67 mph ) in Hakodate .

 When Typhoon Maemi struck South Korea , it caused heavy rainfall that peaked at 453 mm ( 17 @.@ 8 in ) . Rainfall reached 401 @.@ 5 mm ( 15 @.@ 81 in ) in <unk> County , and 255 mm ( 10 @.@ 0 in ) on Jeju Island . The rain was less widespread and caused less flooding than Typhoon Rusa , which struck the country a year prior , but damage from Maemi was heavier due to strong winds . On Jeju Island , Maemi produced a wind gust of 216 km / h ( 134 mph ) and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar ( 28 inHg ) , both setting records for the country . The winds broke the record of 210 km / h ( 130 mph ) set by Typhoon Prapiroon in 2000 , and the pressure was 1 @.@ 5 mbar lower than that during Typhoon Sarah in 1959 , which was one of the strongest storms to strike South Korea after Maemi . On the South Korean mainland , the Pusan International Airport reported wind gusts of 143 km / h ( 89 mph ) . Winds in Busan reached 154 km / h ( 96 mph ) , the second @-@ highest wind speed for the city after Typhoon Thelma in 1987 . Due to high winds , five nuclear power plants were shut down automatically , but were ultimately unaffected . 
 In South Korea , damage was heaviest in South Gyeongsang Province , where 71 people were killed . Damage was particularly heavy in Busan , as well in as <unk> , Ulsan , and Daegu . In Busan , strong winds wrecked 11 lifting cranes , each weighing about 900 tons , which injured five people and killed two in one incident . Many shipyards in the region were closed , and initial reports estimated it would take a year to fully reopen the Busan port . The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $ 50 million ( USD ) , causing cargo capacity to be cut by 20 % . High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan , and in Ulsan the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility , damaging them both . Sixteen people were killed in Busan . 
 High tides flooded hundreds of houses along the coast , particularly in areas without seawalls . In Masan , the storm caused 12 fatalities when it flooded an underground shopping center . On Jeju Island to the south of the country , Maemi destroyed sets of the Korean drama TV series All In , and wrecked 32 houses . Two people were killed on the island , one of whom while attempting to secure his boat . Throughout the country , 465 boats were damaged or beached . The heavy rainfall caused mudslides , one of which in Chungcheong derailed a train , injuring 28 aboard . Mudslides closed several roads , and damaged five rail lines in ten locations . Nationwide , the storm damaged 2 @,@ 278 roads and bridges , as well as nearly 40 @,@ 000 cars . Intense rainfall also caused flooding along the Nakdong River , reaching a flood stage of 5 @.@ 06 m ( 16 @.@ 6 ft ) near Busan . There , the river produced a discharge of about 13 @,@ 000 m ³ / s ( 460 @,@ 000 ft ³ / s ) , strong enough to destroy a section of the <unk> bridge . Along a tributary of the Nakdong River , floods destroyed a dyke near Daegu . Maemi also flooded 37 @,@ 986 ha ( 93 @,@ 870 acres ) of fields before the fall harvest , causing widespread damage to the rice crop . On Ulleungdo island off the eastern coast , Maemi washed away the primary road and many houses , killing three . Residents there complained about the lack of advance warning . 
 Typhoon Maemi left about 1 @.@ 47 million electric customers without power around the country , causing ₩ 12 @.@ 9 billion ( KRW , $ 11 @.@ 61 million USD ) in damage to power companies . Widespread damage interrupted mobile and cell phone service . United States military bases in the country sustained about $ 4 @.@ 5 million in damage . Nationwide , Maemi destroyed about 5 @,@ 000 houses and damaged 13 @,@ 000 homes and businesses , leaving 25 @,@ 000 people homeless . About 150 businesses in Gangwon Province were destroyed by Typhoon Rusa in 2002 , only to be destroyed again by Maemi when they were rebuilt . Insured damages from Maemi were estimated at ₩ 650 billion ( KRW , $ 565 million ) , mostly property damage . The insured damage was over four times the amount of insured damage from Typhoon Rusa the year prior . Overall damage was estimated at ₩ 5 @.@ 52 trillion ( KRW , $ 4 @.@ 8 billion USD ) . By comparison , this total was ₩ 2 @.@ 52 trillion ( KRW , $ 1 @.@ 9 billion USD ) less than Rusa ; the discrepancy between the insured and overall damage was due to Maemi causing heavier industrial damage , while Rusa caused more damage overall . The storm killed 117 people throughout South Korea .

 Although the typhoon prompted the PAGASA to hoist warnings — and in spite of initial concerns that the cyclone would enhance monsoonal rainfall — Maemi did not cause any damage in the Philippines . 
 While recurving east of Taiwan , Maemi dropped significant rainfall , peaking at 227 @.@ 5 mm ( 8 @.@ 96 in ) in Ilan County . The rains helped ease drought conditions and replenished parched reservoirs . 
 In North Korea , Maemi produced about 186 mm ( 7 @.@ 32 in ) of rainfall , although further details of the storm 's effects there were unknown due to press censorship .

 Following the storm , South Korean President Roh Moo @-@ hyun declared the entire of the country excluding Seoul and Incheon as special disaster areas , after touring the storm damage in Busan . The government provided tax breaks and allocated ₩ 1 @.@ 4 trillion ( KRW , $ 1 @.@ 2 billion ) in assistance to the affected residents , after an additional budget was passed in late September 2003 . This included ₩ 100 billion ( KRW , $ 90 million USD ) in immediate funds for search and rescue missions . After the storm , residents complained they did not receive adequate warning and not enough coastal areas were evacuated , which led to the high death toll . Widespread damage and continued flooding caused traffic jams in the days following the storm . A damaged rail line prompted operators to provide alternate bus service . Landslides throughout the country forced travelers to use alternate routes . By three days after the storm , most damaged roads and highways were reopened . About 33 @,@ 000 members of the South Korean Army were deployed to assist in relief efforts , such as clearing roads and delivering aid to storm victims . Workers quickly restored power to 95 % of customers within 24 hours . The government installed four new cranes for the Busan port , and assisted operators to ensure exports would not be delayed . Heavy crop damage caused fruit and vegetable prices to rise , and fish and crop exports rose 9 @.@ 2 % on average . The rice harvest was the lowest in 23 years , due to the storm and a government effort to limit production . To assist farmers , the government increased purchases in federal contracts . Three government @-@ run banks provided low @-@ rate loans for businesses damaged by the storm . Residual flooding from Maemi contributed to an outbreak of conjunctivitis in the southern portion of the country . To prevent additional outbreaks , the Korean National Institute of Health sent 1 @,@ 000 workers to storm @-@ damaged areas . The Korea Stock Exchange fell 1 @.@ 8 % due to fears that storm damage would disrupt exports . 
 For the month of September 2003 , the Korea Electric Power Corporation waived electric bills for residents who lost their homes , and cut bills in half for residents and businesses who lost power . The South Korean government allowed companies to increase premiums for car insurance by 3 @.@ 5 % due to the widespread car damage . Due to storm damage , 34 companies were forced to temporarily close . Loss of production and disruptions were expected to subtract 0 @.@ 5 % from the forecast economic growth in 2003 . The Consumer Confidence Index dropped to its lowest level in five years , largely due to the typhoon damage and weakened economic conditions . Following the strikes of Rusa and Maemi in consecutive years , the South Korean government worked on disaster management and mitigation programs . In March 2004 , the government passed the " Emergency and Safety Management Basic Act " , largely due to the storm as well as the Daegu metro fire , which effectively set up a nationwide emergency management system . The <unk> bridge damaged during the storm was repaired in 2007 . 
 Although the South Korean government did not request international aid , several countries sent aid to the country . A few days after Maemi struck , the United States Agency for International Development sent $ 50 @,@ 000 ( USD ) to the Korean Red Cross . Later , the government of Japan sent ¥ 9 @.@ 5 million ( $ 85 @,@ 000 USD ) worth of supplies to South Korea , including sleeping mats , generators , and water units .

The Republic of Korea National Red Cross utilized 700 volunteers and 200 staff members to distribute food and blankets to 8 @,@ 190 houses , while local offices provided over 5 @,@ 500 meals . Members of Food for the Hungry delivered food and clothing to storm @-@ damaged residents in Masan . 
 As a result of the damage and deaths caused by the storm , the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Maemi in 2006 and replaced it with <unk> . 
 = Ghost in the Shell ( video game ) = 
 Ghost in the Shell is a cyberpunk @-@ themed third @-@ person shooter video game developed by Exact and Production I.G for the PlayStation . A part of the larger Ghost in the Shell media franchise , it utilizes the same English voice cast as the feature film of the same name , although the two do not share a story continuity . The game was first released in July 1997 , along with soundtrack albums , an artbook and a guidebook . 
 The game 's story and art design were written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow , the author of the original manga . Ghost in the Shell 's plot revolves around a recruit of Public Security Section 9 as he investigates and combats the Human Liberation Front . The player controls a Fuchikoma , a robotic fighting vehicle capable of traversing walls and ceilings . 
 The game received mainly positive reviews . It was praised for its graphics , animation , music and unusual wall @-@ climbing mechanics , as well as living up to the name of the series . However , it received criticism for its tedious and repetitive gameplay and low difficulty . Fifteen years after its release , Game Informer listed Ghost in the Shell as one of the best manga and anime @-@ based games . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The player controls a spider @-@ shaped think tank robot , known as Fuchikoma , that is able to jump , thrust forward , strafe to the side , climb walls , and hang upside @-@ down from ceilings . The camera auto @-@ adjusts its position when scaling walls and ceilings for easy maneuvering , and automatically switches between first and third @-@ person perspectives depending on the environment , although the player can stay in first @-@ person view at will . 
 The Fuchikoma is equipped with twin machine guns and guided missiles . Both weapons have unlimited ammunition , however up to six missiles can be launched at once after a charge time . Grenades can be found throughout missions and a maximum of three can be carried at a time . Enemies vary from humanoid robots to helicopters and sport an array of firearms and explosives . Some stages of the game are governed by a time limit . Seventeen cutscenes can be unlocked throughout the missions and depending on the player 's score in training mode . Once unlocked , the cutscenes can be reviewed on the options menu . 
 The training mode contains six stages to learn the basic game elements . The first five stages introduce the player to targets in various settings and using the controls effectively , with the sixth being a battle against another Fuchikoma . The twelve missions that compose the story take place in different environments , including a warehouse complex , a sewer , the city highways , and the enemy base inside of a skyscraper . The missions display a variety of gameplay objectives : the first mission is a raid ; the third level is an Explosive Ordnance Disposal mission that involves the elimination of bombs attached to red barrels ; the fourth level is a sea chase on a boat ; the fifth level is a game of hide @-@ and @-@ seek with the player having to locate a boss wearing <unk> camouflage ; and the game 's final boss fight ends with a free fall battle down the skyscraper under a timer . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The plot follows the members of Public Security Section 9 , mainly consisting of Major Motoko Kusanagi , Chief Aramaki , Batou , Togusa , Ishikawa , Saito , and a nameless male , the Rookie , controlled by the player . The game 's story is told using mission briefings and animated cutscenes . 
 After the terrorist organization known as the Human Liberation Front claims responsibility for blowing up the Megatech Body Corporation building , Section 9 is sent to resolve the situation . Section 9 is able to trace the terrorists ' communications and find their location in the bay area ; however , it is a trap . Chief Aramaki later announces that the leader of the Human Liberation Front is a mercenary known as Zebra 27 . Ishikawa then reports that the Energy Ministry is interested in files relating to Zebra ; Aramaki orders further investigation . 
 The Rookie 's skill is put to the test , leading chase missions and surviving an ambush . Eventually , the Human Liberation Front 's secret base is discovered in <unk> II tower by following the enemy supply line , along with the terrorists ' intentions of using a nuclear reactor . Ishikawa informs Aramaki that an official of the Energy Ministry named Sawamura has been in contact with Zebra and is connected to Megatech Body Corporation . While conducting the raid on the enemy 's base , the reactor begins to overload . In order to shut it down , squad leader Motoko Kusanagi attempts to remove the protective barrier from an access point nearby , as the rest of the team search for the other building 's control room . After disarming the reactor , Kusanagi locates the leader on top of the tower . Batou and Togusa encounter obstacles that prevent them from moving to the top , leaving the Rookie as the only available member . Once he reaches the top , he engages the leader in combat and defeats him in a free fall battle off of the tower . 
 After the mission , it is revealed that Sawamura planned to collect bribes from Megatech in exchange for covering up a defect in the nuclear reactor , which was going to explode , and presenting it as a terrorist attack ; however , Zebra seized the reactor to take it over and wanted to extort money from Sawamura . Kusanagi declares the entire experience a training exercise for the Rookie and acknowledges his cleverness , but criticizes his overdependence on the Fuchikoma . 
 = = Development = = 
 The concept for the Fuchikoma came from one climactic scene of the film : the battle between Motoko Kusanagi and the big spider @-@ like tank in the museum of paleontology . Based on this tank design , mecha creators Shōji Kawamori and Atsushi Takeuchi made a smaller version , designed for one person , that would be used by the police . Thus , the player becomes the pilot of one of these combat machines . 
 The game was in development for one and a half years , and involved the work of several divisions , being Kenji <unk> and Tetsuji Yamamoto the total director and producer respectively . The programming was done by Exact , known for the Jumping Flash ! series . Ghost in the Shell was designed and targeted to a mature audience ; developers did not make Motoko playable to prevent the game appearing to be a character @-@ based game for children . The original manga 's creator Masamune Shirow was the main designer of the characters and mecha for the game . 
 At Production I.G , Hiroyuki <unk> directed the animation scenes , wrote the screenplay and did the storyboards ; Toshihiro Kawamoto was animation supervisor and a character designer . The scenes are noticeably different when compared to the film namesake directed by Mamoru Oshii , because the game is colored using a full digital technique . The scenes are a combination of cel animation and backgrounds that were rendered in three dimensions to ensure smooth transitions for the camera movement . Adobe Photoshop was used to add the finishing details to the scenes . 
 The Japanese voicing of the game was done by a different cast than the film 's : Motoko Kusanagi was played by Hiromi Tsuru , Batou by Shinji Ogawa , Chief Aramaki by Soichi Ito , Ishikawa by Kiyoshi Kobayashi , Togusa by Hirotaka Suzuoki , Saito by Nobuyuki Hiyama , and the Fuchikoma were voiced by <unk> Miwa . The English localization was dubbed by the same cast used for the original movie , although the game does not specify the respective roles in the credits . Motoko was voiced by Mimi Woods , Batou by Richard Epcar , Aramaki by William Frederick , and Togusa by Christopher Joyce ; the roles of Bob Papenbrook , Wendee Lee , Jimmy <unk> and Julie Maddalena are not reliably known .

 The game was originally released in Japan by Sony Computer Entertainment on July 17 , 1997 . The following day , a launch party was held at the <unk> Garden Hall : the Megatech Body Night . The event featured the game 's music artists <unk> <unk> , Joey Beltram and <unk> van Dijk performing live , and a Fuchikoma robot appeared . All who bought tickets received a papercraft kit of the Fuchikoma and ten posters of the game were raffled . A Japanese demo disc was also released with the first mission playable .

 Ghost in the Shell gained an aggregate rating of 78 @.@ 50 % at GameRankings , which would be a mostly positive metascore . AllGame praised the graphics , sound and gameplay ; the review stated , " Even with plenty of eye candy and strong audio , a game is nothing without actually being fun to play and as you 've probably guessed , Ghost in the Shell supplies the fun , whether you 're familiar with the license or not . " GameSpot rated the game as good , eulogizing the controls as " simple ... most people will take to them like a fish to water " and praising the animation sequences . GameFan reviewers cited the game 's unique wall @-@ scaling mechanics and noted how it lives up to the name of the Ghost in the Shell series . IGN said that the game was great , faithful to its manga counterpart , stating that " the techno music , including tracks from artists like Derrick May and <unk> , is superb , " but adding that " the levels aren 't incredibly difficult , and don 't really encourage replay . " Super GamePower reviewed the game short after the movie was released in Brazil , stating that the opening animation was better than the drawing of the film . In Russia , <unk> Drakon lauded the orientation system , the game graphics and the overall design , highlighting the unlockable animation scenes . NowGamer praised the gameplay mechanics but criticized the option to unlock , stating , " The tremendous feeling of agility you get from Ghost In The Shell and the slick weapons is where the fun comes from . But it ’ s a tough game and playing for more scenes of new footage will not be compelling enough for a country in which anime is a cult industry and not a national fixation . " 
 GamePro did not find the game worthy of its name , although the cutscenes were praised , stating , " The cinemas at the opening of the game and between each level are stunning ; however , the game graphics , particularly buildings and enemies , are lackluster at best . The sound effects are bland , and there are no weapon power @-@ ups to be found . Put that all together and you get a very generic game . " Next Generation criticized the game for being tedious , but recognized that it is still an enjoyable game . Computer and Video Games offered similar criticism , declaring that " it was too repetitive to become anything more than a good game . " Edge criticized the gameplay features such as camera control and boss difficulty . Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers criticized the game for its easy bosses and its repetitive and short gameplay value . Famitsu liked the battles but complained about the Fuchikoma attaching to walls when not intended . 
 The Herald @-@ News praised the game for being original and worth playing , unlike other movie adaptations .

 = University of Toronto = 
 The University of Toronto ( U of T , <unk> , or Toronto ) is a public research university in Toronto , Ontario , Canada , situated on the grounds that surround Queen 's Park . It was founded by royal charter in 1827 as King 's College , the first institution of higher learning in the colony of Upper Canada . Originally controlled by the Church of England , the university assumed the present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution . As a collegiate university , it comprises twelve colleges , which differ in character and history , each retaining substantial autonomy on financial and institutional affairs . It has two satellite campuses located in Scarborough and Mississauga . 
 Academically , the University of Toronto is noted for influential movements and curricula in literary criticism and communication theory , known collectively as the Toronto School . The university was the birthplace of insulin and stem cell research , and was the site of the first practical electron microscope , the development of multi @-@ touch technology , the identification of Cygnus X @-@ 1 as a black hole , and the theory of NP @-@ completeness . By a significant margin , it receives the most annual scientific research funding of any Canadian university . It is one of two members of the Association of American Universities located outside the United States , the other being McGill University . 
 The Varsity Blues are the athletic teams representing the university in intercollegiate league matches , with particularly long and storied ties to gridiron football and ice hockey . The university 's Hart House is an early example of the North American student centre , simultaneously serving cultural , intellectual and recreational interests within its large Gothic @-@ revival complex . 
 The University of Toronto has educated two Governors General of Canada and four Prime Ministers of Canada , four foreign leaders , fourteen Justices of the Supreme Court , and has been affiliated with ten Nobel laureates . 
 = = History = = 
 The founding of a colonial college had long been the desire of John Graves Simcoe , the first Lieutenant @-@ Governor of Upper Canada . As an Oxford @-@ educated military commander who had fought in the American Revolutionary War , Simcoe believed a college was needed to counter the spread of republicanism from the United States . The Upper Canada Executive Committee recommended in 1798 that a college be established in York , the colonial capital . 
 On March 15 , 1827 , a royal charter was formally issued by King George IV , proclaiming " from this time one College , with the style and privileges of a University ... for the education of youth in the principles of the Christian Religion , and for their instruction in the various branches of Science and Literature ... to continue for ever , to be called King 's College . " The granting of the charter was largely the result of intense lobbying by John Strachan , the influential Anglican Bishop of Toronto who took office as the first president of the college . The original three @-@ storey Greek Revival school building was constructed on the present site of Queen 's Park . 
 Under Strachan 's stewardship , King 's College was a religious institution that closely aligned with the Church of England and the British colonial elite , known as the Family Compact . Reformist politicians opposed the clergy 's control over colonial institutions and fought to have the college secularized . In 1849 , after a lengthy and heated debate , the newly elected responsible government of Upper Canada voted to rename King 's College as the University of Toronto and severed the school 's ties with the church . Having anticipated this decision , the enraged Strachan had resigned a year earlier to open Trinity College as a private Anglican seminary . University College was created as the nondenominational teaching branch of the University of Toronto . During the American Civil War , the threat of Union blockade on British North America prompted the creation of the University Rifle Corps , which saw battle in resisting the Fenian raids on the Niagara border in 1866 . 
 Established in 1878 , the School of Practical Science was precursor to the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering , which has been nicknamed Skule since its earliest days . While the Faculty of Medicine opened in 1843 , medical teaching was conducted by proprietary schools from 1853 until 1887 , when the faculty absorbed the Toronto School of Medicine . Meanwhile , the university continued to set examinations and confer medical degrees during that period . The university opened the Faculty of Law in 1887 , and it was followed by the Faculty of Dentistry in 1888 , when the Royal College of Dental Surgeons became an affiliate . Women were admitted to the university for the first time in 1884 . 
 A devastating fire in 1890 gutted the interior of University College and destroyed thirty @-@ three thousand volumes from the library , but the university restored the building and replenished its library within two years . Over the next two decades , a collegiate system gradually took shape as the university arranged federation with several ecclesiastical colleges , including Strachan 's Trinity College in 1904 . The university operated the Royal Conservatory of Music from 1896 to 1991 and the Royal Ontario Museum from 1912 to 1968 ; both still retain close ties with the university as independent institutions . The University of Toronto Press was founded in 1901 as the first academic publishing house in Canada . The Faculty of Forestry , founded in 1907 with Bernhard Fernow as dean , was the first university faculty devoted to forest science in Canada . In 1910 , the Faculty of Education opened its laboratory school , the University of Toronto Schools . 
 The First and Second World Wars curtailed some university activities as undergraduate and graduate men eagerly enlisted . Intercollegiate athletic competitions and the Hart House Debates were suspended , although exhibition and <unk> games were still held . The David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill opened in 1935 , followed by the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies in 1949 . The university opened satellite campuses in Scarborough in 1964 and in Mississauga in 1967 . The university 's former affiliated schools at the Ontario Agricultural College and Glendon Hall became fully independent of the University of Toronto and became part of University of Guelph in 1964 and York University in 1965 , respectively . Beginning in the 1980s , reductions in government funding prompted more rigorous fundraising efforts . The University of Toronto was the first Canadian university to amass a financial endowment greater than C $ 1 billion . 
 = = Grounds = = 
 The university grounds lie about 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) north of the Financial District in Downtown Toronto , and immediately south of the neighbourhoods of Yorkville and The Annex . The site encompasses 71 hectares ( 180 acres ) bounded mostly by Bay Street to the east , Bloor Street to the north , Spadina Avenue to the west and College Street to the south . An enclave surrounded by university grounds , Queen 's Park , contains the Ontario Legislative Building and several historic monuments . With its green spaces and many interlocking courtyards , the university forms a distinct region of urban parkland in the city 's downtown core . The namesake University Avenue is a ceremonial boulevard and arterial thoroughfare that runs through downtown between Queen 's Park and Front Street . The Spadina , St. George , Museum , and Queen 's Park stations of the Toronto rapid transit system are located in the vicinity . 
 The architecture is epitomized by a combination of Romanesque and Gothic Revival buildings spread across the eastern and central portions of campus , most of them dating between 1858 and 1929 . The traditional heart of the university , known as Front Campus , is located near the centre of the campus in an oval lawn enclosed by King 's College Circle . The centrepiece is the main building of University College , built in 1857 with an eclectic blend of Richardsonian Romanesque and Norman architectural elements . The dramatic effect of this blended design by architect Frederick William Cumberland drew praise from European visitors of the time : " Until I reached Toronto , " remarked Lord Dufferin during his visit in 1872 , " I confess I was not aware that so magnificent a specimen of architecture existed upon the American continent . " The building was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1968 . Built in 1907 , Convocation Hall is recognizable for its domed roof and Ionic @-@ pillared rotunda . Although its foremost function is hosting the annual convocation ceremonies , the building serves as a venue for academic and social events throughout the year . The sandstone buildings of Knox College epitomizes the North American collegiate Gothic design , with its characteristic cloisters surrounding a secluded courtyard . 
 A lawn at the northeast is anchored by Hart House , a Gothic @-@ revival student centre complex . Among its many common rooms , the building 's Great Hall is noted for large stained @-@ glass windows and a long quotation from John Milton 's <unk> that is inscribed around the walls . The adjacent Soldiers ' Tower stands 143 feet ( 44 m ) tall as the most prominent structure in the vicinity , its stone arches etched with the names of university members lost to the battlefields of the two World Wars . The tower houses a 51 @-@ bell carillon that is played on special occasions such as Remembrance Day and convocation . North of University College , the main building of Trinity College displays Jacobethan Tudor architecture , while its chapel was built in the Perpendicular Gothic style of Giles Gilbert Scott . The chapel features exterior walls of sandstone and interiors of Indiana Limestone , and was constructed by Italian stonemasons using ancient building methods . Philosopher 's Walk is a scenic footpath that follows a meandering , wooded ravine , the buried <unk> Creek , linking with Trinity College , Varsity Arena and the Faculty of Law . Victoria College is on the eastern side of Queen 's Park , centred on a Romanesque main building made of contrasting red sandstone and grey limestone . 
 Developed after the Second World War , the western section of the campus consists mainly of modernist and internationalist structures that contain laboratories and faculty offices . The most significant example of Brutalist architecture is the massive Robarts Library complex , built in 1972 and opened a year later in 1973 . It features raised <unk> , extensive use of triangular geometric designs and a towering fourteen @-@ storey concrete structure that cantilevers above a field of open space and mature trees . Sidney Smith Hall is the home to the Faculty of Arts and Science , as well as a few departments within that faculty . The Leslie L. Dan Pharmacy Building , completed in 2006 , exhibits the high @-@ tech architectural style of glass and steel by British architect Norman Foster . 
 = = Governance and colleges = = 
 The University of Toronto has traditionally been a decentralized institution , with governing authority shared among its central administration , academic faculties and colleges . The Governing Council is the unicameral legislative organ of the central administration , overseeing general academic , business and institutional affairs . Before 1971 , the university was governed under a bicameral system composed of the board of governors and the university senate . The chancellor , usually a former governor general , lieutenant governor , premier or diplomat , is the ceremonial head of the university . The president is appointed by the council as the chief executive . 
 Unlike most North American institutions , the University of Toronto is a collegiate university with a model that resembles those of the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford in Britain . The colleges hold substantial autonomy over admissions , scholarships , programs and other academic and financial affairs , in addition to the housing and social duties of typical residential colleges . The system emerged in the 19th century , as ecclesiastical colleges considered various forms of union with the University of Toronto to ensure their viability . The desire to preserve religious traditions in a secular institution resulted in the federative collegiate model that came to characterize the university . 
 University College was the founding nondenominational college , created in 1853 after the university was secularized . Knox College , a Presbyterian institution , and Wycliffe College , a low church seminary , both encouraged their students to study for non @-@ divinity degrees at University College . In 1885 , they entered a formal affiliation with the University of Toronto , and became federated schools in 1890 . The idea of federation initially met strong opposition at Victoria University , a Methodist school in Cobourg , but a financial incentive in 1890 convinced the school to join . Decades after the death of John Strachan , the Anglican seminary Trinity College entered federation in 1904 , followed in 1910 by St. Michael 's College , a Roman Catholic college founded by the <unk> Fathers . Among the institutions that had considered federation but ultimately remained independent were McMaster University , a Baptist school that later moved to Hamilton , and Queen 's College , a Presbyterian school in Kingston that later became Queen 's University . 
 The post @-@ war era saw the creation of New College in 1962 , Innis College in 1964 and Woodsworth College in 1974 , all of them nondenominational . Along with University College , they comprise the university 's constituent colleges , which are established and funded by the central administration and are therefore financially dependent . Massey College was established in 1963 by the Massey Foundation as a college exclusively for graduate students . Regis College , a Jesuit seminary , entered federation with the university in 1979 . 
 In contrast with the constituent colleges , the colleges of Knox , Massey , Regis , St. Michael 's , Trinity , Victoria and Wycliffe continue to exist as legally distinct entities , each possessing a separate financial endowment . While St. Michael 's , Trinity and Victoria continue to recognize their religious affiliations and heritage , they have since adopted secular policies of enrolment and teaching in non @-@ divinity subjects . Some colleges have , or once had , collegiate structures of their own : Emmanuel College is a college of Victoria and St. Hilda 's College is part of Trinity ; St. Joseph ’ s College had existed as a college within St. Michael 's until it was dissolved in 2006 . Ewart College existed as an affiliated college until 1991 , when it was merged into Knox College . Postgraduate theology degrees are conferred by the colleges of Knox , Regis and Wycliffe , along with the divinity faculties within Emmanuel , St. Michael 's and Trinity , including joint degrees with the university through the Toronto School of Theology . 
 = = Academics = = 
 The Faculty of Arts and Science is the university 's main undergraduate faculty , and administers most of the courses in the college system . While the colleges are not entirely responsible for teaching duties , most of them house specialized academic programs and lecture series . Among other subjects , Trinity College is associated with programs in international relations , as are University College with Canadian studies , Victoria College with Renaissance studies , Innis College with film studies and urban studies , New College with gender studies , Woodsworth College with industrial relations and St. Michael 's College with Medievalism . The faculty teaches undergraduate commerce in collaboration with the Rotman School of Management . The Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering is the other major direct @-@ entry undergraduate faculty . 
 The University of Toronto is the birthplace of an influential school of thought on communication theory and literary criticism , known as the Toronto School . Described as " the theory of the primacy of communication in the structuring of human cultures and the structuring of the human mind " , the school is rooted in the works of Eric A. Havelock and Harold Innis and the subsequent contributions of Edmund Snow Carpenter , Northrop Frye and Marshall McLuhan . Since 1963 , the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology of the Faculty of Information has carried the mandate for teaching and advancing the Toronto School . 
 Several notable works in arts and humanities are based at the university , including the Dictionary of Canadian Biography since 1959 and the Collected Works of Erasmus since 1969 . The Records of Early English Drama collects and edits the surviving documentary evidence of dramatic arts in pre @-@ Puritan England , while the Dictionary of Old English compiles the early vocabulary of the English language from the Anglo @-@ Saxon period . 
 The Munk School of Global Affairs encompasses the university 's various programs and curricula in international affairs and foreign policy . As the Cold War heightened , Toronto 's Slavic studies program evolved into an important institution on Soviet politics and economics , financed by the Rockefeller , Ford and Mellon foundations . The Munk School is also home to the G20 Research Group , which conducts independent monitoring and analysis on the Group of Twenty , and the Citizen Lab , which conducts research on Internet censorship as a joint founder of the <unk> Initiative . The university operates international offices in Berlin , Hong Kong and Siena . 
 The Dalla Lana School of Public Health is a Faculty of the University of Toronto that originated as one of the School of Hygiene begun by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1927 . The School went through a dramatic renaissance after the 2003 SARS crisis and it is now the largest public health school in Canada , with more than 750 faculty , 800 students , and research and training partnerships with institutions throughout Toronto and the world . With more than $ 39 million in research funding per year , the School supports discovery in global health , tobacco impacts on health , occupational disease and disability , air pollution , inner city , circumpolar health , and many other pressing issues in population health . 
 The Faculty of Medicine is affiliated with a network of ten teaching hospitals , providing medical treatment , research and advisory services to patients and clients from Canada and abroad . A core member of the network is University Health Network , itself a specialized federation of Toronto General Hospital , Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , Toronto Western Hospital , and Toronto Rehabilitation Institute . Physicians in the medical institutes have cross @-@ appointments to faculty and supervisory positions in university departments . The Rotman School of Management developed the discipline and methodology of integrative thinking , upon which the school bases its curriculum . Founded in 1887 , the Faculty of Law 's emphasis on formal teachings of liberal arts and legal theory was then considered unconventional , but gradually helped shift the country 's legal education system away from the apprenticeship model that prevailed until the mid @-@ 20th century . The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education is the teachers college of the university , affiliated with its two laboratory schools , the Institute of Child Study and the University of Toronto Schools . Autonomous institutes at the university include the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics , the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies and the Fields Institute .

 Since 1926 , the University of Toronto has been a member of the Association of American Universities , a consortium of the leading North American research universities . The university manages by far the largest annual research budget of any university in Canada , with sponsored direct @-@ cost expenditures of $ 878 million in 2010 . The federal government was the largest source of funding , with grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council amounting to about one @-@ third of the research budget . About eight percent of research funding came from corporations , mostly in the health care industry . 
 The first practical electron microscope was built by the physics department in 1938 . During World War II , the university developed the G @-@ suit , a life @-@ saving garment worn by Allied fighter plane pilots , later adopted for use by astronauts . Development of the infrared chemiluminescence technique improved analyses of energy behaviours in chemical reactions . In 1963 , the asteroid <unk> Toronto is discovered in the David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill and is named after the university . In 1972 , studies on Cygnus X @-@ 1 led to the publication of the first observational evidence proving the existence of black holes . Toronto astronomers have also discovered the Uranian moons of Caliban and Sycorax , the dwarf galaxies of Andromeda I , II and III , and the supernova SN 1987A . A pioneer in computing technology , the university designed and built UTEC , one of the world 's first operational computers , and later purchased <unk> , the second commercial computer after UNIVAC I. Multi @-@ touch technology was developed at Toronto , with applications ranging from handheld devices to collaboration walls . The <unk> Atlas , which was the first to win the Igor I.

 The discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is considered among the most significant events in the history of medicine . The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963 , forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells . This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells , including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells . The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers , who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia , brain tumors and colorectal cancer . Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the <unk> index , the infant cereal <unk> , the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker . The first successful single @-@ lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981 , followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988 , and the first double @-@ lung transplant in 1989 .

 = = Athletics = = 
 The 44 sports teams of the Varsity Blues represent the university in intercollegiate competitions . The two main leagues in which the Blues participate are Canadian Interuniversity Sport for national competitions , and the auxiliary Ontario University Athletics conference at the provincial level . The athletic nickname of Varsity Blues was not consistently used until the 1930s ; previously , references such as " Varsity " , " The Big Blue " , " The Blue and White " and " The Varsity Blue " also appeared interchangeably . The Blue and White is commonly played and sung in athletic games as a fight song . 
 North American ( gridiron ) football traces its very origin to the University of Toronto , with the first documented football game played at University College on November 9 , 1861 . The Blues played their first intercollegiate football match in 1877 against the University of Michigan , in a game that ended with a scoreless draw . Since intercollegiate seasons began in 1898 , the Blues have won four Grey Cup , two Vanier Cup and 25 Yates Cup championships , including the inaugural championships for all three trophies . However , the football team has hit a rough patch following its last championship in 1993 . From 2001 until 2008 , the Blues suffered the longest losing streak in Canadian collegiate history , recording 49 consecutive winless games . This was preceded by a single victory in 2001 that ended a run of 18 straight losses . The site of Varsity Stadium has served as the primary playing grounds of the Varsity Blues football and soccer programs since 1898 . It also served as the venue for archery during the 2015 Pan American Games . 
 Formed in 1891 , the storied Varsity Blues men 's ice hockey team has left many legacies on the national , professional and international hockey scenes . Conn Smythe played for the Blues as a centre during his undergraduate years , and was a Blues coach from 1923 to 1926 . When Smythe took over the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1927 , the familiar blue @-@ and @-@ white sweater design of the Varsity Blues was adopted by his new team . Blues hockey competed at the 1928 Winter Olympics and captured the gold medal for Canada . At the 1980 Winter Olympics , Blues coach Tom Watt served as co @-@ coach of the Canadian hockey team in which six players were Varsity grads . In all , the Blues have won the CIS University Cup national hockey title ten times , last in 1984 . Varsity Arena has been the permanent home of the Blues ice hockey programs since it opened in 1926 . In men 's basketball , the Varsity Blues have won 14 conference titles , including the inaugural championship in 1909 , but have not won a national title . In swimming , the men 's team has claimed the national crown 16 times since 1964 , while the women 's team has claimed the crown 14 times since 1970 . Established in 1897 , the University of Toronto Rowing Club is the oldest collegiate rowing club in Canada . It earned a silver medal for the country in the 1924 Summer Olympics , finishing second to Yale 's crew . 
 The back campus of University College was used for field hockey during the 2015 Pan American Games and the field was renamed Pan Am / Parapan Am Fields for the duration of the Pan American Games . 
 = = Culture and student life = = 
 In the heart of social , cultural and recreational life at the University of Toronto lies Hart House , the sprawling neo @-@ Gothic student activity centre that was conceived by alumnus @-@ benefactor Vincent Massey and named for his grandfather Hart . Opened in 1919 , the complex established a communitarian spirit in the university and its students , who at the time kept largely within their own colleges under the decentralized collegiate system . At Hart House , a student can read in the library , dine casually or formally , have a haircut , visit the art gallery , watch a play in the theatre , listen to a concert , observe or join in debates , play billiards , or go for a swim and find a place to study , all under the same roof and within the span of a day . The confluence of assorted functions is the result of a deliberate effort to create a holistic educational experience , a goal summarized in the Founders ' Prayer . The Hart House model was influential in the planning of student centres at other universities , notably Cornell University 's Willard Straight Hall . 
 Hart House resembles some traditional aspects of student representation through its financial support of student clubs , and its standing committees and board of stewards that are composed mostly of undergraduate students . However , the main students ' unions on administrative and policy issues are the University of Toronto Students ' Union , Association of Part @-@ time Undergraduate Students and the Graduate Students ' Union . Student representative bodies also exist at the various colleges , academic faculties and departments . 
 The Hart House Debating Club employs a debating style that combines the American emphasis on analysis and the British use of wit . Smaller debating societies at Trinity , University and Victoria College have served as initial training grounds for debaters who later progress to Hart House . The club won the World Universities Debating Championship in 1981 and 2006 . The North American Model United Nations hosts an annual Model United Nations conference on campus , while the United Nations Society participates in various North American and international conferences . The Toronto chess team has captured the top title six times at the Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship . The Formula SAE Racing Team won the Formula Student European Championships in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 .

 The University of Toronto is home to the first collegiate fraternity in Canada , Zeta Psi , whose Toronto chapter has been active since 1879 . Because few other Canadian universities in the 19th century were deemed comparable to their American counterparts in repute , age and secularity , most early American fraternities chose to open their first international chapter at the University of Toronto , including Delta Kappa Epsilon , Sigma Chi , Delta Upsilon , Phi Delta Theta , Phi Kappa Sigma , Phi Gamma Delta , Psi Upsilon , Alpha Delta Phi , Beta Theta Pi , Pi Kappa Phi , Lambda Phi Epsilon , Sigma Nu , Theta Delta Chi , Alpha Kappa Nu , Alpha Omicron Pi , Delta Delta Delta , Alpha Kappa Delta Phi and Lambda Chi Alpha . Other Greek @-@ letter societies include Alpha Gamma Delta , Alpha Phi , Alpha Sigma Nu , Delta Phi Nu , Gamma Phi Beta , Kappa Alpha Society , Delta Psi Delta , Kappa Kappa Gamma , Pi Beta Phi , Sigma Pi , and Alpha Epsilon Pi . A secret society known as <unk> has operated from Trinity College since 1858 .

 Hart House Theatre is the university 's student amateur theatre , generally producing four major plays every season . As old as Hart House itself , the theatre is considered a pioneer in Canadian theatre for introducing the Little Theatre Movement from Europe . It has cultivated numerous performing @-@ arts talents , including Donald Sutherland , Lorne Michaels , Wayne and Shuster and William Hutt . Three members of the Group of Seven artists ( Harris , Lismer and MacDonald ) have been set designers at the theatre , and composer Healey Willan was director of music for fourteen productions . The theatre also hosts annual variety shows run by several student theatrical companies at the colleges and academic faculties , the most prominent of which are U.C. Follies of University College , Skule Nite of the Faculty of Engineering , and <unk> of the Faculty of Medicine , the latter in its hundredth year of production in 2010 – 2011 . 
 The main musical ensembles at Hart House are the orchestra , the chamber strings , the chorus , the jazz choir , the jazz ensemble and the symphonic band . The Jazz at Oscar 's concert series performs big band and vocal jazz on Friday nights at the period lounge and bar of the Hart House Arbor Room . Open Stage is the monthly open mic event featuring singers , comics , poets and storytellers . The Sunday Concert is the oldest musical series at Hart House ; since 1922 , the series has performed more than 600 classical music concerts in the Great Hall , freely attended by the university community and general audiences . The public may also screen midday events held at noon , when concerts are recited prior to formal debut .

 The Varsity is one of Canada 's oldest student @-@ run newspapers , in publication since 1880 . The paper was originally a daily broadsheet , but has since adopted a compact format and is now weekly with three summer issues . Hart House Review , a literary magazine , publishes prose , poetry , and visual art from emerging Canadian writers and artists . The Newspaper is an independent student @-@ run community newspaper , published weekly since 1978 . <unk> @-@ FM is the university 's campus radio station , while the University of Toronto Television broadcasts student @-@ produced content . Students at each college and academic faculty also produce their own set of journals and news publications . University College 's The Gargoyle was an early training ground for such notables as journalist Naomi Klein , and musician / comedian Paul Shaffer . Victoria University 's Acta Victoriana is the oldest active literary journal in Canada , and provided first publication credits to such literary figures as Margaret Atwood and Northrop Frye . 
 Members of the student press have contributed to activist causes on several notable occasions . At the height of debate on coeducation in 1880 , The Varsity published an article in its inaugural issue voicing in favour of admitting women . In 1895 , the university suspended the editor of The Varsity for breach of collegiality , after he published a letter that harshly criticized the provincial government 's dismissal of a professor and involvement in academic affairs . University College students then approved a motion by Varsity staff member William Lyon Mackenzie King and boycotted lectures for a week . After Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau decriminalized homosexuality throughout Canada in 1969 , a medical research assistant placed an advertisement in The Varsity seeking volunteers to establish the first university homophile association in Canada . 
 = = = Residences = = = 
 Each college at the University of Toronto operates its own set of residence halls and dining halls clustered in a different area of the campus . Innis , New , St. Michael 's , Trinity , University , Victoria , and Woodsworth colleges reserve most of their dormitories for their undergraduate students within the Faculty of Arts and Science , while setting a portion available to students from the professional and postgraduate faculties . Massey College is exclusively for graduate students , while Knox and Wycliffe Colleges mainly house graduate theology students . Annesley Hall of Victoria College , a National Historic Site , was the first university residence for women in Canada . After St. Hilda 's College became coeducational in 2005 , Annesley Hall and Loretto College of St. Michael 's College are the last remaining women 's halls at the university . 
 As campus residences accommodate just 6 @,@ 400 students in all , the university guarantees housing only for undergraduates in their first year of study , while most upper @-@ year and graduate students reside off @-@ campus . Traditionally , the adjacent neighbourhoods of The Annex and Harbord Village are popular settling grounds for University of Toronto students , forming a distinct student quarter enclave . In 2004 , the university purchased and converted a nearby hotel into the Chestnut Residence , which houses students from all colleges and faculties . There are also numerous fraternity houses and student housing cooperatives , where boarders pay reduced rent for assuming housekeeping duties .

 = Sheryl Crow ( album ) = 
 Sheryl Crow is the second studio album by the American singer Sheryl Crow , released on September 24 , 1996 by A & M Records . Unlike its predecessor Tuesday Night Music Club , which was written by a casual collective formed by Crow and several other musicians , Sheryl Crow was entirely produced by Crow , who wrote most of the songs alone or with only one collaborator . Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studio in New Orleans , Louisiana . The album covers topics of American life , relationship breakups , and moral and ethical issues , while encompassing a variety of music genres such as rock , blues , alternative rock , country , and folk . 
 Sheryl Crow was a commercial success , being certified 3 × platinum by the RIAA and 3 × platinum by the BPI . It also reached No. 6 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and produced five singles , including the international hit " If It Makes You Happy " . The album received very positive reviews from critics , who praised its intricate production and Crow 's louder and more assured singing . At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards , the album was awarded Best Rock Album and Crow received the Best Female Rock Vocal Performance award for " If It Makes You Happy " . Retrospectively , it is often regarded as one of Crow 's best albums .

 Sheryl Crow is the follow @-@ up to Sheryl Crow 's 1993 album Tuesday Night Music Club , which was written by a group of musicians known as the " Tuesday Music Club " . The group existed as a casual collective formed by Crow and musicians Bill Bottrell , David <unk> , Kevin Gilbert , Brian MacLeod , David Ricketts , and Dan Schwartz . The album was a commercial success and produced several hit singles , including " All I Wanna Do " , " Strong Enough " , and " Leaving Las Vegas " . It was certified 7 × Platinum in the United States and 2 × Platinum in the United Kingdom . Crow was also awarded Best New Artist , Best Female Pop Vocal Performance , and Record of the Year at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards . 
 Tensions between Crow and other members of the group began to arise following Crow 's performance of " Leaving Las Vegas " on the Late Show with David Letterman in March 1994 . Crow offhandedly agreed with the host when she was asked if the track was autobiographical , even though it was primarily written by <unk> and based on the book of the same name by his friend John O 'Brien . As a result , several members of the Tuesday Music Club group felt betrayed , and O 'Brien himself committed suicide three weeks later . Nevertheless , O 'Brien 's parents insisted that Crow had nothing to do with the tragedy , noting that he " was just mad about it [ ... ] But the problems that drove him toward the end were – you know , that 's a long , long bloody trip . " 
 After Tuesday Night Music Club , Crow wanted to prove her authority as a musician . According to her , " My only objective on this record was to get under people 's skin , because I was feeling like I had so much shit to hurl at the tape . " Work on the new album began at Toad Hall in Pasadena , California , the same studio where Tuesday Night Music Club was recorded , but sessions were soon relocated to New Orleans , Louisiana because Crow " was feeling ghosts in that room " . Bottrell was designated to produce the record and co @-@ wrote three songs that would appear on the album , but eventually left because he could not sort out his differences with Crow . As a result , Crow took over production duties and wrote most of the songs alone or with only one collaborator . She also played most of the instruments on the album , including bass and guitar work and nearly all the keyboard parts . Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studio in New Orleans , although Crow would later return to Los Angeles to complete work at The Sound Factory and Sunset Sound . Audio mastering took place at Gateway Mastering Studios in Portland , Maine .

 Musically , Sheryl Crow was described as a combination of rock , blues , alternative rock , country , folk , and light hip hop loops . Unlike its predecessor , it also features a more off @-@ balance production and a richer instrumentation , with " lots of fuzz , <unk> , hammond , moog . Nothing extreme , perhaps , but almost psychedelic when joined to big mainstream melodies " , one critic explained . The album covers topics of American life , relationship breakups , and moral and ethical issues , among others . For example , " Home " is a folk ballad where Crow recounts the emotional difficulties of a deteriorating relationship , while " Superstar " deals with a woman fantasizing about stardom . The song " A Change Would Do You Good " , which features hand claps and organ licks , is about the need to escape a constricted life . 
 The opening track , " Maybe Angels " , was described as " a cryptic ode to UFOs and government conspiracies that plays like an X @-@ Files theme song . " Crow explained that the song is " an extraterrestrial yarn that finds Kurt Cobain joining John Lennon in heaven 's winged choir " . The track " Redemption Day " is a protest against the US indifference to the Bosnian War . It was inspired when Crow visited the country as part of a USO trip with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton . The song was later covered by Johnny Cash , appearing on his 2010 posthumous record American VI : Ain 't No Grave . The track " Hard to Make a Stand " references abortion , while " Love Is a Good Thing " criticizes Walmart 's gun sales policy with the lyrics " Watch out sister / Watch out brother / Watch our children as they kill each other / with a gun they bought at the Wal @-@ Mart discount stores . " The song caused some controversy , resulting in Walmart banning sales of the album at their stores . 
 The album 's lead single , " If It Makes You Happy " , underwent several different arrangements before being turned into a rock song . According to musician Jeff Trott , who co @-@ wrote the song along with Crow , " It started off as a twangy , David Lynch @-@ esque sort of thing . Then [ ... ] we played it like punk rock , really fast , as well as country and funky . You know , you get a song and put clothes on it to see what looks good and what doesn 't , and usually when you find the right one it 's pretty obvious . With that song it was real obvious ! " Trott initially wrote the song when he was a member of Pete <unk> 's backing band , but Crow added a second verse and strengthened the melody . Sheryl Crow also has contributions by notable musicians . For example , " Sweet Rosalyn " features saxophone by Steve Berlin of Los Lobos , while " Everyday Is a Winding Road " features harmony vocals by Neil Finn of Crowded House .

 Upon release , Sheryl Crow received general acclaim from most music critics . Eric Weisbard of Spin praised the album 's production , stating that the record " goes much further " than its predecessor and that its " bigger beats and dirtier guitar / keyboard effects [ work ] well with Crow 's literate hippie @-@ chick persona " . David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated similar pros , commenting : " If there 's such a thing as a professional lo @-@ fi album , Sheryl Crow is it . " He also noted Crow 's louder and more assured singing , concluding that she " doesn 't expose that much of herself [ ... ] she 's an emotional centrist . But at the very least , she 's building a bridge to a lasting career " . Writing for The Baltimore Sun , J.D. Considine praised Crow 's vocals , especially on " If It Makes You Happy " , which he felt was probably the album 's best song . 
 Despite the praise , the last third of the album was considered the weakest part and the song " Ordinary Morning " was considered a poor choice for a closer . Rolling Stone editor David Fricke also criticized the album for being underdeveloped and lacking originality , and unfavorably compared the song " Hard to Make a Stand " to " Tumbling Dice " by the Rolling Stones and " Sweet Jane " by the Velvet Underground . In February 1997 , Sheryl Crow was ranked at number 26 in The Village Voice 's 1996 Pazz & Jop critics ' poll . At the 39th Annual Grammy Awards , the album was awarded Best Rock Album and Crow received the Best Female Rock Vocal Performance award for the song " If It Makes You Happy " . 
 Retrospectively , AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine referred to the album as " a postmodern masterpiece of sorts -- albeit a mainstream , post @-@ alternative , postmodern masterpiece . It may not be as hip or innovative as , say , the Beastie Boys ' Paul 's Boutique , but it is as self @-@ referential , pop culture obsessed , and musically eclectic . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine highlighted the album 's " quirky , stream @-@ of @-@ conscious lyrics " and elaborate sound collages , stating that " none of [ Crow 's ] other full @-@ length albums have been as consistent , immaculately produced or distinctly modern . " In 1999 , Rolling Stone selected Sheryl Crow as one of the essential albums of the decade . In 2002 , the <unk> also ranked it at number 44 in its list of Women in Rock : The 50 Essential Albums . In 2003 , the album was featured in the Vital Pop : 50 Essential Pop Albums list by Slant Magazine . In 2008 , Entertainment Weekly magazine placed the album at number 39 in their list of Top 100 Best Albums of the past 25 years .

 ? ( also written Tanda Tanya , meaning Question Mark ) is a 2011 Indonesian drama film directed by Hanung Bramantyo . It stars Revalina <unk> Temat , Reza Rahadian , Agus Kuncoro , Endhita , Rio Dewanto , and Hengky Sulaeman . The theme is Indonesia 's religious pluralism , which often results in conflict between religious beliefs , represented in a plot that revolves around the interactions of three families , one Buddhist , one Muslim , and one Catholic . After undergoing numerous hardships and the deaths of several family members in religious violence , they are reconciled . 
 Based on Bramantyo 's experiences as a mixed @-@ race child , ? was meant to counter the portrayal of Islam as a " radical religion " . Owing to the film 's theme of religious pluralism and controversial subject matter , Bramantyo had difficulty finding backing . Eventually , Mahaka Pictures put forth Rp 5 billion to fund the production . Filming began on 5 January 2011 in Semarang . 
 Released on 7 April 2011 , ? was a critical and commercial success : it received favourable reviews and was viewed by more than 550 @,@ 000 people . Also screened internationally , it was nominated for nine Citra Awards at the 2011 Indonesian Film Festival , winning one . However , several Indonesian Muslim groups , including the Indonesian Ulema Council and Islamic Defenders Front , protested against the film because of its pluralist message . 
 = = Plot = = 
 ? focuses on interfaith relations in Indonesia , a country where religious conflicts are common , and there is a long history of violence and discrimination against Chinese Indonesians . The storyline follows three families living in a village in Semarang , Central Java : the Chinese @-@ Indonesian Buddhist Tan Kat Sun ( Hengky Sulaeman ) and his son Hendra ( Rio Dewanto ) , the Muslim couple Soleh ( Reza Rahadian ) and Menuk ( Revalina S. Temat ) , and the Catholic @-@ convert Rika ( Endhita ) and her Muslim son Abi . 
 Sun and Hendra run a Chinese restaurant that serves pork , which is forbidden for Muslims , although the restaurant has many Muslim clients and staff . To ensure good relations with his Muslim employees and customers , Sun uses special utensils for the preparation of pork , which he does not permit to be used for other dishes , and allows his staff time for prayers ; he also gives them a holiday during Eid ul @-@ Fitr , the largest Muslim holiday . One of his employees is Menuk , who supports her unemployed husband Soleh . Rika is Menuk 's friend and is involved with the unsuccessful Muslim actor Surya ( Agus Kuncoro ) . 
 Already in his 70s , Sun falls ill , and the restaurant is taken over by Hendra , who decides it will serve exclusively pork , alienating Muslim customers . Hendra comes into conflict with Soleh over Menuk , as Hendra had previously dated her . Menuk becomes increasingly depressed after Soleh tells her that he plans to divorce her , and they are driven apart . Rika feels stressed as a result of how she has been treated by her neighbours and family after converting to Catholicism from Islam ; Abi is also facing ostracism . Meanwhile , Surya and Doni ( Glenn Fredly ) are competing for Rika 's affections . Surya is upset over his failure to find a good acting job . 
 Soleh joins the Islamic charitable group Nahdlatul Ulama ( NU ) , hoping to gain confidence . Though he is initially reluctant to protect the security of a church , he ends up sacrificing his life when he discovers a bomb has been planted in a Catholic church . He rushes out with the bomb , which explodes outside the church , killing Soleh , but away from the worshippers . Sun dies when the restaurant , which did not close to honour Eid ul @-@ Fitr , is attacked by a group of Muslims . After the attack , Hendra reads the 99 Names of Allah and converts to Islam ; he attempts to approach Menuk , although it is unclear if she will accept him . Surya receives an offer from Rika to play the role of Jesus in her church 's Christmas and Easter pageants , which he accepts for a high fee after hesitating due to fears that it will be against his religion ; after the pageant he reads Al @-@ Ikhlas in a mosque . Rika is able to obtain her parents ' blessing for her conversion .

 ? was directed by Hanung Bramantyo , who is of mixed Chinese @-@ Javanese descent . He decided to direct a pluralist @-@ themed film based on his own experiences as a mixed @-@ race child . He chose the title ? to avoid protests upon the film 's release , saying that if it had been named Liberalism or Pluralism there would be protests by opponents of those ideologies , and that he could not think of a better title . The individual characters are based on people Bramantyo has known or read about . His goal in making the film was to " clarify misleading arguments about Islam " and counter the portrayal of Islam as a " radical religion " . In a pre @-@ release press conference , Bramantyo said that ? was not meant to be commercial , but to make a statement . The film , his fourteenth , is one of several Islam @-@ themed movies he has directed , after the polygamous romantic drama Ayat @-@ Ayat Cinta ( The Verses of Love ; 2008 ) and the biopic Sang Pencerah ( The Enlightener ; 2009 ) . 
 Fearing that the theme of pluralism would be taken as a " battle cry " , some investors abandoned their commitments ; Bramantyo was also unable to find support from mainstream studios . Before screening the film for the Indonesian Film Censor Board , several scenes were cut , including one in which a pig 's head was displayed in the window of Sun 's restaurant ; other scenes that raised commentary were kept , although trimmed . Prior to the film 's release , Bramantyo consulted about twenty people , including several religious leaders , in an attempt to ensure that the film was not offensive . <unk> <unk> was brought in to work further with the script ; she put more emphasis on the message of tolerance . 
 Mahaka Pictures , owned by the same group as the predominantly Muslim Republika , co @-@ produced the film with <unk> Film . The director of Mahaka Pictures , Erick Thohir , stated that his company had assisted with production because he " was disturbed by the fact that Indonesian films have declined in quality " . He was willing to work with Bramantyo , as he found that the latter had proven to be a skilled director of religious films through his earlier work . Filming began on 5 January 2011 in Semarang ; Bramantyo later described the city as a good example of tolerance in action . The film reportedly cost Rp 5 billion ( US $ 600 @,@ 000 ) to produce . Two songs by the Indonesian band Sheila on 7 , " Pasti <unk> " ( " Sure I Can " ) and " <unk> <unk> " ( " Dictionary to My Life " ) were used in the soundtrack , while <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> handled sound editing . 
 <unk> Hadi <unk> , based in Semarang , was tasked with casting the minor roles . Bramantyo contacted the main cast members directly . Agus Kuncoro , who had acted in Sang Pencerah and was known for playing in Islamic @-@ themed films , agreed to play Surya in ? immediately after reading the script . Singer Glenn Fredly was interested in playing Doni because he considered the character , an ultra @-@ conservative Catholic , an interesting role , given the sensitive religious situation in the country . Revalina S. Temat , who had appeared in Bramantyo 's 2009 film Perempuan <unk> <unk> ( The Girl With the <unk> Around Her Neck ) , found her role as Menuk interesting and more serious than her recent work in horror films . Endhita , whom Bramantyo called for the role , expressed interest as soon as she received an outline of the plot . 
 = = Themes and style = = 
 Ade Irwansyah , writing for Tabloid Bintang , notes that the film is a " microcosm " of Indonesia , which has numerous religious groups that often come into conflict . Irwansyah writes that Bramantyo intended for viewers to think of the religious conflicts that happen daily , and how to deal with differences in culture and beliefs , while Bramantyo has called the film his own personal interpretation of the country 's religious situation . The film critic Eric Sasono noted this was apparent from the film 's tagline , " Is it still important that we are different ? " , and suggested that Bramantyo feared that Indonesia was becoming a monolithic state . According to Sasono , the conflict in ? is settled when the characters begin believing that all religions are good , and all praise God ; thus , all religious conflict would end if people were to accept other beliefs . 
 The Jakarta Globe describes the film as a " study of the role and state of Islam in modern Indonesian society " . Sasono noted that the Muslim majority in the film did not have their motives shown explicitly , be it for the use of the racist term " Cino " or for attacking Sun 's restaurant . After comparing the actions of Muslim groups in ? and Asrul Sani 's films Al <unk> ( 1977 ) and Titian <unk> <unk> Tujuh ( Titian <unk> , Divided by Seven ; 1982 ) , Sasono suggested that Bramantyo may have been expressing a fear that these groups no longer needed provocateurs to attack others . He notes that a scene in which a Catholic priest is stabbed by two men on a motorcycle reflects a September 2010 case in Bekasi , which had become a national issue . He further describes the camera angles as vulgar , abandoning subtlety , but suggests that they made the work more dramatic ; he indicates that this was readily apparent with a scene in which part of a mosque falls apart .

 ? debuted at <unk> City in South Jakarta on 31 March 2011 , with a wide release on 7 April . Its release coincided with a contest sponsored by a local cellular service provider that called on viewers to decide the best name to describe the events shown in the film ; it was said that the best name to be submitted would be used on the DVD release , but this was ultimately not done . Within five days of its premiere , ? had been seen by almost 100 @,@ 000 people . ? had been watched by more than 550 @,@ 000 people by mid @-@ September . The film was also shown internationally . At the sixth Indonesian Film Festival in Australia , ? was screened to full theatres on 25 August 2011 as the festival 's closing film . According to Bramantyo , the film was also screened in Vancouver and Paris , receiving positive feedback . 
 A novelisation of the film , entitled Harmoni Dalam Tanda Tanya ( Harmony in Tanda Tanya ) and published by Mahaka Publishing , was released in December 2011 . Written by <unk> <unk> dan <unk> , it further expanded the background of the film , including the relationship between Hendra and Menuk . On 21 February 2012 , ? was released on DVD by Jive ! Collection , after passing the censorship board in January . The DVD featured Indonesian audio , Indonesian and English subtitles , a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes documentary , and a gallery of photographs from production . In a preface on the DVD 's liner notes , Ronny P. <unk> of Jive ! Collection wrote that viewers should view the film with open hearts , as the conflicts within reflected actualities in society . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Critical reaction to ? was favourable . Indah <unk> of The Jakarta Post wrote that the film was a " gallant attempt to promoted [ sic ] moderate Islam and reveal the sensitive issues in the country in a casual way " , and that viewers should " get ready to burst into laughter and break down in tears " . <unk> , writing for Tempo , said that it was better than the 2010 Citra Award winner 3 Hati Dua Dunia , Satu Cinta , which had similar themes . <unk> DS , reviewing for Suara Karya after a press screening , praised the plot , visuals , and music . 
 Benny Benke , writing for the Semarang @-@ based daily Suara Merdeka , found that Bramantyo had used ? to portray tolerance in Indonesia without making the subject seem cliché ; however , he considered some scenes , such as Hendra 's conversion , overdone . Frans <unk> , reviewing for the historically Catholic daily Kompas , considered the film heavily didactic but ultimately interesting , because its social commentary was much needed , considering Indonesia 's religious turmoil . He also noted that the characters were driven to their actions by worldly needs and not religion . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 After the release of ? , the conservative Islamic Defenders Front ( Front Pembela Islam , or FPI ) demonstrated against the film , owing to its pluralist message . Banser , the youth wing of the NU , also protested the film , taking offence to a scene in which Banser members are paid to do their charitable duties ; they insisted that they are not . Meanwhile , the head of the Center For Culture of the Indonesian Ulema Council ( Majelis Ulama Indonesia , or MUI ) <unk> Ridwan stated that " the film clearly propagates religious pluralism " , which the MUI had previously declared haraam ( forbidden ) in 2005 . Protests also erupted when SCTV announced plans to show ? during Eid al @-@ Fitr in 2011 ; the FPI organised a demonstration in front of the station 's office , in which hundreds of its members called for further cuts to the film . The network later decided against showing the film in a decision which was heavily criticised and seen as " giving in " to the FPI . 
 In response to the criticism of ? , Minister of Culture and Tourism <unk> <unk> expressed that the film would be best titled Bhinneka Tunggal Ika ( " Unity in Diversity " , the Indonesian national motto ) , and that its depiction of inter @-@ ethnic and interfaith tolerance reflected Indonesia 's " national character " . <unk> Wahid , a religious activist and daughter of former president and noted pluralist Abdurrahman Wahid , said that ? had " succeeded in conveying the ideas of pluralism in Indonesia " , and that critics should not look at it in fragments . Although initially tweeting that the protests were free promotion , Bramantyo later entered discussions with the MUI and agreed to cut some scenes to avoid protests . In an October 2011 interview , he said he was " bewildered " that the film was poorly received by Muslims .

 ? received 9 nominations at the 2011 Indonesian Film Festival , winning one Citra Award for Best Cinematography . Together with Ifa Isfansyah 's Sang Penari and Benni Setiawan 's Masih Bukan Cinta <unk> ( Still Not Normal Love ) , it was the most @-@ nominated film of the year ; however , ? received the least Citra Awards of the three .

In 2012 ? was nominated for three awards at the Bandung Film Festival , winning none ; all three awards were taken by The Mirror Never Lies . 
 = German Type U 66 submarine = 
 The Type U 66 was a class of five submarines or U @-@ boats operated by the German Imperial Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) during World War I. The class is alternately referred to as the U @-@ 66 @-@ class or the Type UD . The class was built by Germaniawerft of Kiel to their 506d design as the U @-@ 7 @-@ class for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . The five boats were sold to the Imperial Germany Navy at the beginning of World War I when it was thought impossible for the submarines to reach the Mediterranean for delivery to Austria @-@ Hungary . 
 The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , after competitively evaluating six submarines of three foreign designs , selected the Germaniwerft 506d or Type UD design over a design from Whitehead & Co. for the U @-@ 7 class . The boats , numbered U @-@ 7 to U @-@ 11 , were designed to be 228 feet ( 69 m ) long and displace between 695 and 885 tonnes ( 684 and 871 long tons ) when surfaced and submerged . They were to be armed with five torpedo tubes and a deck gun . For propulsion the design called for twin diesel engines for surface running and twin electric motors for subsurface movement . The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ordered the boats in February 1913 and construction began on the first boats in November . 
 After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy became convinced that delivery of the still @-@ unfinished submarines to the Mediterranean via Gibraltar would be impossible . As a result , they sold the five boats to the Imperial German Navy in November 1914 . The German Navy assigned the numbers U @-@ 66 to U @-@ 70 to the five submarines and had them redesigned and reconstructed to their specifications . These changes , which included a larger deck gun , increased the displacement of the U @-@ boats by almost 100 tonnes ( 98 long tons ) surfaced and nearly 50 tonnes ( 49 long tons ) submerged . 
 All five boats saw active service , and four sank 18 or more ships . Only U @-@ 68 , sunk six days into her first war patrol in March 1916 , had no successes . Two other boats , U @-@ 66 and U @-@ 69 disappeared in 1917 . The remaining two U @-@ boats , U @-@ 67 and U @-@ 70 , were surrendered to the United Kingdom and were broken up by 1921 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1904 , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , after allowing the navies of other countries to pioneer submarine developments , ordered the Austrian Naval Technical Committee ( German : <unk> <unk> or MTK ) to produce a submarine design . When the Navy rejected the January 1905 MTK design and other designs submitted as part of a public competition as impracticable , they instead opted to order two submarines each of designs by Simon Lake , Germaniawerft , and John Philip Holland for a competitive evaluation . 
 Based on the trials results , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy determined the characteristics that the next generation of Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines should have . They were looking for a double @-@ hulled submarine of about 500 tonnes ( 490 long tons ) displacement with diesel propulsion . They also wanted a surface speed of 16 – 18 knots ( 30 – 33 km / h ; 18 – 21 mph ) , and for the boat to be armed with between three and five 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy selected the Germaniawerft 506d design , also known as the Type UD , for the U @-@ 7 class over the Type 48 design submitted by Whitehead & Co . , primarily because of the lower cost . The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913 . 
 = = Design = = 
 The U @-@ 7 class was seen by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy as an improved version of its U @-@ 3 class , which was also a Germaniawerft design . As designed for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , the boats were to displace 695 tonnes ( 684 long tons ) on the surface and 885 tonnes ( 871 long tons ) while submerged . The doubled @-@ hulled boats were to be 228 feet ( 69 m ) long overall with a beam of 20 feet 8 inches ( 6 @.@ 30 m ) and a draft of 12 feet 5 inches ( 3 @.@ 78 m ) . The Austrian specifications called for two shafts with twin diesel engines ( 2 @,@ 300 metric horsepower ( 2 @,@ 269 bhp ; 1 @,@ 692 kW ) total ) for surface running at up to 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) , and twin electric motors ( 1 @,@ 240 PS ( 1 @,@ 223 shp ; 912 kW ) total ) for a maximum of 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) when submerged . 
 The boats were designed with five 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes ; four located in the bow , one in the stern . The boats ' armament was to also include a single 6 @.@ 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) / 26 deck gun .

 After the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy 's 1 February 1913 order , the first two boats , U @-@ 7 and U @-@ 8 , were laid down at Germaniawerft on 1 November . U @-@ 9 was laid down at the end of December , and the final two boats , U @-@ 10 and U @-@ 11 were both begun in February 1914 . Construction of the boats was slated to be complete within 29 to 33 months . 
 None of the submarines were complete when World War I began in August 1914 . With the boats under construction at Kiel , the Austrians became convinced that it would be impossible to take delivery of the boats , which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar , a British territory . As a result , the five boats of the class were transferred to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 after the advance payment of 2 million <unk> had been returned . Germaniawerft was then awarded <unk> D , hence the type was known as UD . 
 After their purchase , the boats were assigned the numbers U @-@ 66 to U @-@ 70 , and the class became known as the U 66 type . The Imperial German Navy had the submarines redesigned and reconstructed to German standards , which increased the surface displacement by 96 tonnes ( 94 long tons ) and the submerged by 48 tonnes ( 47 long tons ) . The torpedo load was increased by a third , from 9 to 12 , and the deck gun was upgraded from the 6 @.@ 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) gun originally specified to an 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) one . 
 U @-@ 66 was launched on 22 April 1915 , the first of the class , and was followed by the other four about one every three weeks , with the last boat , U @-@ 70 , hitting the water on 20 July . The boats were all completed and commissioned into the Imperial German Navy between July and September .

 All the boats of the U @-@ 66 class saw active service , and all but one boat , U @-@ 68 , had wartime successes ; U @-@ 69 and U @-@ 70 both sank over 100 @,@ 000 tons of Allied shipping . U @-@ 68 was sunk by the British Q @-@ ship HMS Farnborough in March 1916 , and was the first boat of the class to be lost during the war . U @-@ 69 and U @-@ 66 were lost in July and September 1917 , respectively .

 = Times Square Ball = 
 The Times Square Ball is an LED geodesic sphere located in New York City 's Times Square . Located on the roof of One Times Square , the ball is a prominent part of a New Year 's Eve celebration in Times Square Commonly known as the ball drop , where the ball descends 141 feet ( 43 m ) in 60 seconds down a specially designed flagpole , beginning at 11 : 59 : 00 p.m. ET , and resting at midnight to signal the start of the new year . In recent years , the festivities have been preceded by live entertainment , including performances by musicians . 
 The event was first organized by Adolph Ochs , owner of The New York Times newspaper , as a successor to a series of New Year 's Eve fireworks displays he held at the building to promote its status as the new headquarters of the Times , while the ball itself was designed by Artkraft Strauss . First held on December 31 , 1907 , to welcome 1908 , the ball drop has been held annually since , except in 1942 and 1943 in observance of wartime blackouts . 
 The ball 's design has also been updated over the years to reflect improvements in lighting technology ; the original design was made from wood and iron and lit with 100 incandescent light bulbs , while its current incarnation features a computerized LED lighting system and an outer surface consisting of triangle @-@ shaped crystal panels . Since 2009 , the current ball has been displayed atop the building year @-@ round , while the original , smaller version of the current ball that was used in 2008 is on display at Times Square 's visitor center . 
 The event is organized by the Times Square Alliance and Countdown Entertainment , a company led by Jeff Strauss , and is among the most notable New Year 's celebrations internationally : it is attended by at least 2 million spectators yearly , and is nationally televised as part of New Year 's Eve specials broadcast by a number of networks and cable channels . The prevalence of the Times Square ball drop has inspired similar " drops " at other local New Year 's Eve events across the country ; while some use balls , some instead drop objects that represent local culture or history .

 To facilitate the arrival of attendees , Times Square is closed to traffic on beginning in the late afternoon on New Year 's Eve . The square is then divided into different viewing sections referred to as " pens " , into which attendees are directed sequentially upon arrival . Security is strictly enforced by the New York City Police Department ( NYPD ) , even more so since the 2001 @-@ 02 edition in the wake of the September 11 attacks . Attendees are required to pass through security checkpoints before they are assigned a pen , and are prohibited from bringing backpacks or alcohol to the event .

 Festivities formally begin in the early evening with the raising of the ball at around 6 : 00 p.m. ET . Party favors are also distributed to attendees , which have historically included large balloons , hats , and other items branded with the event 's corporate sponsors . The hours before the drop are preceded by hourly countdowns for the arrival of the new year in other countries , along with live music performances by popular musicians . Some of these performances are organized by , and aired on New Year 's Eve television specials which are broadcast from Times Square . 
 The drop itself occurs at 11 : 59 p.m. — the last minute of the year , and is ceremonially " activated " by a dignitary or celebrity joined on @-@ stage by the current Mayor of New York City . The conclusion of the drop is followed by fireworks shot from the roof of One Times Square , along with the playing of " Auld Lang Syne " by Guy Lombardo , " Theme from New York , New York " by Frank Sinatra , " America the Beautiful " by Ray Charles , " What a Wonderful World " by Louis Armstrong , and " Over the Rainbow " by <unk> . 
 Since the 1996 New Year 's Eve celebration , the current Mayor of New York City has been joined by a special guest , selected yearly to recognize their community involvement or significance , in ceremonially " activating " the ball drop by pressing a button , resembling a smaller version of the ball itself , at exactly one minute to midnight . The button itself does not actually trigger the drop ; that is done from a control room , synchronized using a government time signal . Special guests who have activated the ball drop have included :

 The first New Year 's Eve celebration in Times Square was held on December 31 , 1904 ; The New York Times ' owner , Adolph Ochs , decided to celebrate the opening of the newspaper 's new headquarters , One Times Square , with a New Year 's fireworks show on the roof of the building to welcome 1905 . Close to 200 @,@ 000 people attended the event , displacing traditional celebrations that had normally been held at Trinity Church . However , following several years of fireworks shows , Ochs wanted a bigger spectacle at the building to draw more attention to the area . The newspaper 's chief electrician , Walter F. Palmer , suggested using a time ball , after seeing one used on the nearby Western Union Building . 
 Ochs hired sign designer Artkraft Strauss to construct a ball for the celebration ; it was built from iron and wood , electrically lit with one hundred incandescent light bulbs , weighed 700 pounds ( 320 kg ) , and measured 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) in diameter . The ball was hoisted on the building 's flagpole with rope by a team of six men . Once it hit the roof of the building , the ball was designed to complete an electric circuit to light a 5 @-@ foot tall sign indicating the new year , and trigger a fireworks show . The first ever " ball drop " was held on December 31 , 1907 , welcoming the year 1908 . 
 In 1913 , only eight years after it moved to One Times Square , the Times moved its corporate headquarters to 229 West 43rd Street . The Times still maintained ownership of the tower , however , and Strauss continued to organize future editions of the drop . 
 = = = The second and third balls ( 1920 – 98 ) = = = 
 The original ball was retired in 1920 in favor of a new design ; the second ball remained 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) in diameter , but was now constructed from iron , weighing 400 pounds ( 180 kg ) . The ball drop was placed on hiatus for New Year 's Eve 1942 and 1943 due to wartime lighting restrictions during World War II . Instead , a moment of silence was observed at midnight in Times Square , accompanied by the sound of chimes played from sound trucks . 
 The second ball was retired in favor of a third design in 1955 ; again , it maintained the same diameter of its predecessors , but was now constructed from aluminium , and weighed 150 pounds ( 68 kg ) . In 1981 , the third ball was revamped in honor of the I Love New York campaign , with red lightbulbs and a green stem to give it the appearance of an apple . For 1988 , organizers acknowledged the addition of a leap second earlier that day ( leap seconds are appended at midnight UTC , which is five hours before midnight in New York ) by extending the drop to 61 seconds , and by including a special one @-@ second light show during the extra second . The original white lightbulbs returned to the ball for 1989 , but were replaced by red , white , and blue bulbs in 1991 to salute the troops of Operation Desert Shield . 
 The third ball was revamped again in 1995 for 1996 , adding a computerized lighting system with 180 halogen bulbs and 144 strobe lights , and over 12 @,@ 000 rhinestones . Lighting designer Barry Arnold stated that the changes were " something [ that ] had to be done to make this event more spectacular as we approach the millennium . " 
 The drop itself also became computerized through the use of an electric winch synced with the National Institute of Standards and Technology 's time signal ; the new system was not without issues , however , as a glitch caused the ball to pause for a short moment halfway through its descent . After its 44th use in 1999 , the third ball was retired and placed on display at the Atlanta headquarters of Jamestown Group , owners of One Times Square . 
 = = = Into the new millennium ( 1999 – 2007 ) = = = 
 On December 28 , 1998 , during a press conference attended by New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani , organizers announced that the third ball would be retired for the arrival of the new millennium , and replaced by a new design constructed by Waterford Crystal . The year 2000 celebrations would also introduce more prominent sponsorship to the drop ; companies such as Discover Card , <unk> Champagne , and Panasonic were announced as official sponsors of the festivities in Times Square . The city also announced that Ron Silver would lead a committee known as " NYC 2000 " , to be in charge of organizing events across New York City for the year 2000 celebrations , particularly outside of Times Square . 
 A full day of festivities was held at Times Square to celebrate the arrival of the year 2000 , which included concerts and hourly cultural presentations with parades of puppets designed by Michael Curry , representing countries entering the new year at that hour . Organizers expected a total attendance exceeding 2 million spectators . 
 The fourth ball , measuring 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) in diameter and weighing 1 @,@ 070 pounds ( 490 kg ) , incorporated a total of over 600 halogen bulbs , 504 triangle @-@ shaped crystal panels provided by Waterford , 96 strobe lights , and spinning , pyramid @-@ shaped mirrors . The ball was constructed at Waterford 's factory in Ireland , and was then shipped to New York City , where the lighting system and motorized mirrors were installed . Many of the triangles were inscribed with " Hope " -themed designs changing yearly , such as " Hope for Fellowship " , " Hope for Wisdom " , " Hope for Unity " , " Hope for Courage " , " Hope for Healing " , and " Hope for Abundance " . 
 For 2002 , the ball 's crystals were engraved with the names of nations and organizations who were affected by the September 11 attacks . 
 = = = Present day ( 2008 – present ) = = = 
 In honor of the ball drop 's centennial anniversary , a brand new fifth design debuted for New Year 's Eve 2008 . Once again manufactured by Waterford Crystal with a diameter of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) , but weighing 1 @,@ 212 pounds ( 550 kg ) , it used LED lamps provided by Philips ( which can produce 16 @,@ 777 @,@ 216 or 224 colors ) , with computerized lighting patterns developed by the New York City @-@ based lighting firm Focus Lighting . The ball featured 9 @,@ 576 energy @-@ efficient bulbs that consumed the same amount of electricity as only 10 toasters . The 2008 ball was only used once , and was placed on display at the Times Square Visitors Center following the event . 
 For 2009 , a larger version of the fifth ball was introduced — an icosahedral geodesic sphere lit by 32 @,@ 256 LED lamps . Its diameter is twice as wide as 2008 ball , at 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) , and contains 2 @,@ 688 Waterford Crystal panels , with a weight of 11 @,@ 875 pounds ( 5 @,@ 386 kg ) . It was also designed to be weatherproof , as the ball would now be displayed atop One Times Square nearly year @-@ round following the celebrations . 
 Yearly themes for the ball 's crystal panels continued ; from 2008 to 2013 , the ball contained crystal patterns that were part of a Waterford series known as " World of Celebration " , including themes such as " Let There Be Light " and " Let There Be Peace " . For 2014 , all the ball 's panels were replaced , marking a new theme series known as " Greatest Gifts " , beginning with " Gift of Imagination " . 
 The numerical sign indicating the year ( which remains atop the tower along with the ball itself ) also uses Philips LED lamps . For 2014 , the final two digits of the sign used bulbs from the company 's " Hue " line of multi @-@ color LED lamps , allowing them to also have computerized lighting cues .

 According to the National Weather Service , from 1907 to 2011 , the average temperature at midnight in New York City was 33 @.@ 7 ° F ( 0 @.@ 9 ° C ) .

The warmest ball drop was 58 ° F ( 14 ° C ) in both 1965 and 1972 . It has snowed during the ball drop just seven times out of 109 events ( one being light snow ) — 1926 , 1934 , 1948 , 1952 , 1961 , 1967 , and 2009 — and it has rained multiple times . 
 = = Broadcasting = = 
 As a public event , the festivities and ball drop are broadcast as part of New Year 's Eve television specials originating from Times Square on several major U.S. television networks and cable channels . By far the most notable of these is Dick Clark 's New Year 's Rockin ' Eve ; created , produced , and originally hosted by the entertainer Dick Clark until his death in 2012 , and currently hosted by Ryan Seacrest , Jenny McCarthy , and Fergie , the program first aired on NBC in 1972 before moving to ABC , where it has been broadcast ever since . New Year 's Rockin ' Eve has consistently been the most @-@ watched New Year 's Eve special in the U.S. , peaking at 22 @.@ 6 million viewers for its 40th edition in 2012 . Following the death of Dick Clark in April 2012 , a crystal engraved with his name was added to the 2013 ball in tribute . 
 Across the remaining networks , NBC broadcasts New Year 's Eve with Carson Daly , hosted from Times Square by Carson Daly of The Voice and Last Call , and Spanish @-@ language network Univision broadcasts ¡ Feliz ! , hosted from Times Square by Raúl de Molina of El Gordo y La <unk> . On cable , CNN carries coverage of the festivities , known as New Year 's Eve Live , which has been hosted by Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin from Times Square . Fellow news channel Fox News Channel carries All @-@ American New Year , most recently hosted by Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Bill Hemmer from Times Square . 
 MTV has also broadcast coverage originating from the network 's Times Square studios at One Astor Plaza . For 2011 , MTV also held its own ball drop in Seaside Heights , New Jersey , the setting of its popular reality series Jersey Shore , featuring cast member Snooki lowered inside a giant " hamster ball " . Originally , MTV planned to hold the drop within its studio in Times Square , but the network was asked by city officials to conduct the drop elsewhere . 
 Since 2009 , organizers have produced an official webcast of the ball drop and its associated festivities .

 Beginning in the 1940s , NBC broadcast coverage from Times Square anchored by Ben Grauer on both radio and television . Its coverage was later incorporated into special episodes of The Tonight Show , continuing through Johnny Carson and Jay Leno 's tenures on the program . NBC would introduce a dedicated special , New Year 's Eve with Carson Daly , beginning in 2003 . 
 From 1956 to 1976 , CBS was well known for its television coverage of the festivities hosted by bandleader Guy Lombardo from the ballroom of the Waldorf @-@ Astoria Hotel in New York City , featuring his band 's famous rendition of " Auld Lang Syne " at midnight . After Lombardo 's death in 1977 , CBS and the Royal Canadians , now led by Victor Lombardo , attempted to continue the special . However , Guy 's absence and the growing popularity of ABC 's New Year ’ s Rockin ’ Eve prompted CBS to eventually drop the band entirely . The Royal Canadians were replaced by a new special , Happy New Year , America , which ran in various formats with different hosts ( such as Paul Anka , Donny Osmond , Andy Williams , Paul Shaffer , and Montel Williams ) until it was discontinued after 1996 . CBS , barring a special America 's Millenium broadcast for 2000 , no longer provides any national coverage from Times Square . 
 For 2000 , in lieu of New Year 's Rockin ' Eve , ABC News covered the festivities as part of its day @-@ long telecast , ABC 2000 Today . Hosted by Peter Jennings , the broadcast featured coverage of millennium festivities from around the world , including those in New York City . Jennings was joined by Dick Clark as a special correspondent for coverage from Times Square . 
 Fox previously aired New Year 's specials covering Times Square with rotating hosts and themes , primarily under the title New Year 's Eve Live . For 2015 , New Year 's Eve Live was replaced by Pitbull 's New Year 's Revolution , which is broadcast from Miami instead .

 K @-@ 383 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Kansas . The highway runs 74 @.@ 042 miles ( 119 @.@ 159 km ) from U.S. Route 83 ( US @-@ 83 ) and K @-@ 23 near Selden north and east to US @-@ 183 near Woodruff , just south of the Nebraska state line . K @-@ 383 runs southwest – northeast and connects Norton with Colby to the southwest and Alma , Nebraska , to the northeast via the valley of Prairie Dog Creek , a tributary of the Republican River . The highway also serves the cities of Selden in northern Sheridan County ; Dresden , Jennings , and Clayton in southeastern Decatur County ; Almena in eastern Norton County ; and Long Island in northern Phillips County . K @-@ 383 is a part of the National Highway System from its western terminus at US @-@ 83 to the eastern US @-@ 36 junction near Norton . 
 K @-@ 383 was assigned in 1981 over the portions of former US @-@ 383 that had not run concurrently with either US @-@ 83 or US @-@ 183 . The highway was originally designated as parts of US @-@ 36 and K @-@ 22 in the mid @-@ 1920s . The entire route became US @-@ 83 and was placed on much of its modern alignment in the early <unk> replacing the original path that followed section lines . The route was redesignated US @-@ 383 in the mid @-@ 1940s and paved from the late 1930s to the late 1940s . The highway was relocated within Norton in the late 1930s and early 1940s . Other relocations of K @-@ 383 have included the segment near Clayton in the mid @-@ 1950s , southwest of Norton in the late 1930s and again in the early 1960s , and at both ends of the highway in the early 1990s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 K @-@ 383 begins at a four @-@ legged intersection northeast of the town of Selden in northern Sheridan County . US @-@ 83 heads west toward Selden and Colby and north toward Oberlin ; K @-@ 23 heads south and east toward Hoxie . K @-@ 383 heads northeast as a two @-@ lane road immediately parallel to the Kyle Railroad and a couple of miles south of Prairie Dog Creek . The highway enters Decatur County and intersects K @-@ 223 north of the village of <unk> and K @-@ 123 while passing through the city of Dresden . K @-@ 383 and the railroad enter the creek valley shortly before the city of Jennings , through which the road is Railroad Street . The highway separates from the railroad for several miles prior to rejoining at the city of Clayton at the Decatur – Norton county line . K @-@ 383 leaves the railroad again southwest of the village of Oronoque , heading east then curving north to cross Prairie Dog Creek at its entrance to Keith Sebelius Lake . The highway crosses over the Kyle Railroad before intersecting US @-@ 36 , with which the state highway runs concurrently east . 
 K @-@ 383 and US @-@ 36 intersect K @-@ 261 , a spur serving Prairie Dog State Park , before reaching the city of Norton . The highways curve northeast and back east and pass through the northern part of the city as Holme Street , a four @-@ lane undivided road . K @-@ 383 and US @-@ 36 intersect US @-@ 283 ( State Street ) north of the downtown area . The highways become a two @-@ lane road again as they leave Norton . K @-@ 383 and US @-@ 36 cross over the Kyle Railroad and begin to parallel the railroad and Prairie Dog Creek . The highways meet the southern end of K @-@ 67 , a spur serving the Norton Correctional Facility , before they diverge . US @-@ 36 continues east and K @-@ 383 heads northeast parallel to the Kyle Railroad through the hamlet of Calvert . The state highway meets the northern end of K @-@ 60 just before it crosses over the Kyle Railroad on the edge of the city of Almena . K @-@ 383 continues east parallel to the Nebraska Kansas Colorado Railway into Phillips County . After they pass through the city of Long Island , that railroad splits to the north into Nebraska . K @-@ 383 passes through the village of Woodruff shortly before it reaches its northern terminus at US @-@ 183 about one half @-@ mile south of the Nebraska state line . 
 = = History = = 
 The portion of K @-@ 383 southwest of Almena was part of the Rock Island Highway , an auto trail that paralleled the Chicago , Rock Island and Pacific Railroad northeast from Colby to Norton and then east along the northern tier of the state to St. Joseph , Missouri . When the U.S. Highway System was laid out in 1926 , the Rock Island Highway , which had become integrated into the Pikes Peak Ocean to Ocean Highway , was designated US @-@ 36 . The portion of K @-@ 383 north of the US @-@ 36 split was K @-@ 22 . By 1927 , all of the highway along the K @-@ 383 corridor followed section lines , with a great number of right @-@ angle turns , except for a small section south of Almena . US @-@ 36 and K @-@ 22 were graded throughout Norton County but were unimproved dirt roads in Decatur , Phillips , and Sheridan counties . 
 By 1932 , US @-@ 36 headed west from Norton toward Oberlin instead of southwest toward Selden , and all of what is K @-@ 383 became part of US @-@ 83 . The entire route from Selden to Nebraska had been straightened , mostly paralleling the railroad instead of following section lines , except for through Oronoque and Jennings . US @-@ 83 was a gravel road from Selden to the Norton – Phillips county line , east of which the highway remained a dirt road until it was graveled in 1937 . The highway was relocated straight through Jennings and to a path with fewer turns through Oronoque in 1938 ; that same year , the highway was paved with a bituminous surface along the US @-@ 36 concurrency . US @-@ 83 was paved from the US @-@ 36 split to the Nebraska state line in 1940 . The highway was paved from Selden to Dresden by 1945 and from Dresden to US @-@ 36 west of Norton in 1948 . US @-@ 383 was assigned to the entire length of the K @-@ 383 corridor and beyond in both directions by 1945 . 
 The first modern relocations along what is now K @-@ 383 occurred in Norton . US @-@ 36 and US @-@ 83 originally entered the city along Washington Street , turned north onto First Avenue , and turned east onto Main Street . The highway followed Main Street out of town and along a road paralleling the railroad to the present highway . The first realignment was authorized in 1936 to eliminate several right @-@ angle turns and several at @-@ grade railroad crossings . East of the intersection of First and Main , US @-@ 36 and US @-@ 83 turned north onto State Street and followed the highway to Holme Street , where the highways joined the present course . By 1941 , this change was deemed unsatisfactory due to the continued existence of right @-@ angle turns and grade crossings . Shortly thereafter , the highways were moved to their present course bypassing downtown Norton . 
 US @-@ 383 was relocated to K @-@ 383 's present alignment southwest of Clayton starting in 1954 . The highway was constructed along its current route near Oronoque concurrent with the construction of the Norton Reservoir ( now Keith Sebelius Lake ) on Prairie Dog Creek around 1962 . The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved the removal of the US @-@ 383 designation in 1979 . K @-@ 383 was assigned to the portions of former US @-@ 383 in Kansas from US @-@ 83 near Selden to a concurrency with US @-@ 183 at the Nebraska state line in 1981 . In 1990 , K @-@ 383 's western terminus was relocated to its present spot . K @-@ 383 had begun at US @-@ 83 's intersection with the first east – west section line road the latter highway intersects west of K @-@ 383 . US @-@ 83 followed the section line road to near what was then K @-@ 23 's northern terminus , then turned north along another section line road and passed under K @-@ 383 and the Kyle Railroad ; a connector ramp was used between US @-@ 83 and K @-@ 383 at the bridges , which were constructed by 1951 . US @-@ 83 was relocated to remove the grade separations and both K @-@ 383 and K @-@ 23 were given their present termini ; the east – west section line road west of K @-@ 23 was transferred to county maintenance . In 1994 , K @-@ 383 was relocated at its present eastern terminus to remove what had been a wye junction with US @-@ 183 .

It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning . People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively , or when they interpret it in a biased way . The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs . People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position . Biased search , interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain attitude polarization ( when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence ) , belief perseverance ( when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false ) , the irrational primacy effect ( a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series ) and illusory correlation ( when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations ) . 
 A series of experiments in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs . Later work re @-@ interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one @-@ sided way , focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives . In certain situations , this tendency can bias people 's conclusions . Explanations for the observed biases include wishful thinking and the limited human capacity to process information . Another explanation is that people show confirmation bias because they are weighing up the costs of being wrong , rather than investigating in a neutral , scientific way . 
 Confirmation biases contribute to overconfidence in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence . Poor decisions due to these biases have been found in political and organizational contexts . 
 = = Types = = 
 Confirmation biases are effects in information processing . They differ from what is sometimes called the behavioral confirmation effect , commonly known as self @-@ fulfilling prophecy , in which a person 's expectations influence their own behavior , bringing about the expected result . 
 Some psychologists restrict the term confirmation bias to selective collection of evidence that supports what one already believes while ignoring or rejecting evidence that supports a different conclusion . Other psychologists apply the term more broadly to the tendency to preserve one 's existing beliefs when searching for evidence , interpreting it , or recalling it from memory . 
 = = = Biased search for information = = = 
 Experiments have found repeatedly that people tend to test hypotheses in a one @-@ sided way , by searching for evidence consistent with their current hypothesis . Rather than searching through all the relevant evidence , they phrase questions to receive an affirmative answer that supports their hypothesis . They look for the consequences that they would expect if their hypothesis were true , rather than what would happen if it were false . For example , someone using yes / no questions to find a number he or she suspects to be the number 3 might ask , " Is it an odd number ? " People prefer this type of question , called a " positive test " , even when a negative test such as " Is it an even number ? " would yield exactly the same information . However , this does not mean that people seek tests that guarantee a positive answer . In studies where subjects could select either such pseudo @-@ tests or genuinely diagnostic ones , they favored the genuinely diagnostic . 
 The preference for positive tests in itself is not a bias , since positive tests can be highly informative . However , in combination with other effects , this strategy can confirm existing beliefs or assumptions , independently of whether they are true . In real @-@ world situations , evidence is often complex and mixed . For example , various contradictory ideas about someone could each be supported by concentrating on one aspect of his or her behavior . Thus any search for evidence in favor of a hypothesis is likely to succeed . One illustration of this is the way the phrasing of a question can significantly change the answer . For example , people who are asked , " Are you happy with your social life ? " report greater satisfaction than those asked , " Are you unhappy with your social life ? " 
 Even a small change in a question 's wording can affect how people search through available information , and hence the conclusions they reach . This was shown using a fictional child custody case . Participants read that Parent A was moderately suitable to be the guardian in multiple ways . Parent B had a mix of salient positive and negative qualities : a close relationship with the child but a job that would take him or her away for long periods of time . When asked , " Which parent should have custody of the child ? " the majority of participants chose Parent B , looking mainly for positive attributes . However , when asked , " Which parent should be denied custody of the child ? " they looked for negative attributes and the majority answered that Parent B should be denied custody , implying that Parent A should have custody . 
 Similar studies have demonstrated how people engage in a biased search for information , but also that this phenomenon may be limited by a preference for genuine diagnostic tests . In an initial experiment , participants rated another person on the introversion – extroversion personality dimension on the basis of an interview . They chose the interview questions from a given list . When the interviewee was introduced as an introvert , the participants chose questions that presumed introversion , such as , " What do you find unpleasant about noisy parties ? " When the interviewee was described as extroverted , almost all the questions presumed extroversion , such as , " What would you do to liven up a dull party ? " These loaded questions gave the interviewees little or no opportunity to falsify the hypothesis about them . A later version of the experiment gave the participants less presumptive questions to choose from , such as , " Do you shy away from social interactions ? " Participants preferred to ask these more diagnostic questions , showing only a weak bias towards positive tests . This pattern , of a main preference for diagnostic tests and a weaker preference for positive tests , has been replicated in other studies . 
 Personality traits influence and interact with biased search processes . Individuals vary in their abilities to defend their attitudes from external attacks in relation to selective exposure . Selective exposure occurs when individuals search for information that is consistent , rather than inconsistent , with their personal beliefs . An experiment examined the extent to which individuals could refute arguments that contradicted their personal beliefs . People with high confidence levels more readily seek out contradictory information to their personal position to form an argument . Individuals with low confidence levels do not seek out contradictory information and prefer information that supports their personal position . People generate and evaluate evidence in arguments that are biased towards their own beliefs and opinions . Heightened confidence levels decrease preference for information that supports individuals ' personal beliefs . 
 Another experiment gave participants a complex rule @-@ discovery task that involved moving objects simulated by a computer . Objects on the computer screen followed specific laws , which the participants had to figure out . So , participants could " fire " objects across the screen to test their hypotheses . Despite making many attempts over a ten @-@ hour session , none of the participants figured out the rules of the system . They typically attempted to confirm rather than falsify their hypotheses , and were reluctant to consider alternatives . Even after seeing objective evidence that refuted their working hypotheses , they frequently continued doing the same tests . Some of the participants were taught proper hypothesis @-@ testing , but these instructions had almost no effect . 
 = = = Biased interpretation = = = 
 Confirmation biases are not limited to the collection of evidence . Even if two individuals have the same information , the way they interpret it can be biased . 
 A team at Stanford University conducted an experiment involving participants who felt strongly about capital punishment , with half in favor and half against it . Each participant read descriptions of two studies : a comparison of U.S. states with and without the death penalty , and a comparison of murder rates in a state before and after the introduction of the death penalty . After reading a quick description of each study , the participants were asked whether their opinions had changed . Then , they read a more detailed account of each study 's procedure and had to rate whether the research was well @-@ conducted and convincing . In fact , the studies were fictional . Half the participants were told that one kind of study supported the deterrent effect and the other undermined it , while for other participants the conclusions were swapped . 
 The participants , whether supporters or opponents , reported shifting their attitudes slightly in the direction of the first study they read . Once they read the more detailed descriptions of the two studies , they almost all returned to their original belief regardless of the evidence provided , pointing to details that supported their viewpoint and disregarding anything contrary . Participants described studies supporting their pre @-@ existing view as superior to those that contradicted it , in detailed and specific ways . Writing about a study that seemed to undermine the deterrence effect , a death penalty proponent wrote , " The research didn 't cover a long enough period of time " , while an opponent 's comment on the same study said , " No strong evidence to contradict the researchers has been presented " . The results illustrated that people set higher standards of evidence for hypotheses that go against their current expectations . This effect , known as " <unk> bias " , has been supported by other experiments . 
 Another study of biased interpretation occurred during the 2004 U.S. presidential election and involved participants who reported having strong feelings about the candidates . They were shown apparently contradictory pairs of statements , either from Republican candidate George W. Bush , Democratic candidate John Kerry or a politically neutral public figure . They were also given further statements that made the apparent contradiction seem reasonable . From these three pieces of information , they had to decide whether or not each individual 's statements were inconsistent . There were strong differences in these evaluations , with participants much more likely to interpret statements from the candidate they opposed as contradictory . 
 In this experiment , the participants made their judgments while in a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanner which monitored their brain activity . As participants evaluated contradictory statements by their favored candidate , emotional centers of their brains were aroused . This did not happen with the statements by the other figures . The experimenters inferred that the different responses to the statements were not due to passive reasoning errors . Instead , the participants were actively reducing the cognitive dissonance induced by reading about their favored candidate 's irrational or hypocritical behavior There were strong differences in these evaluations , with participants much more likely to interpret statements from the candidate they opposed as contradictory . 
 <unk> in belief interpretation are persistent , regardless of intelligence level . Participants in an experiment took the SAT test ( a college admissions test used in the United States ) to assess their intelligence levels . They then read information regarding safety concerns for vehicles , and the experimenters manipulated the national origin of the car . American participants provided their opinion if the car should be banned on a six @-@ point scale , where one indicated " definitely yes " and six indicated " definitely no . " Participants firstly evaluated if they would allow a dangerous German car on American streets and a dangerous American car on German streets . Participants believed that the dangerous German car on American streets should be banned more quickly than the dangerous American car on German streets . There was no difference among intelligence levels at the rate participants would ban a car . 
 Biased interpretation is not restricted to emotionally significant topics . In another experiment , participants were told a story about a theft . They had to rate the evidential importance of statements arguing either for or against a particular character being responsible . When they hypothesized that character 's guilt , they rated statements supporting that hypothesis as more important than conflicting statements . 
 = = = Biased memory = = = 
 Even if people gather and interpret evidence in a neutral manner , they may still remember it selectively to reinforce their expectations . This effect is called " selective recall " , " confirmatory memory " or " access @-@ biased memory " . Psychological theories differ in their predictions about selective recall . Schema theory predicts that information matching prior expectations will be more easily stored and recalled than information that does not match . Some alternative approaches say that surprising information stands out and so is memorable . Predictions from both these theories have been confirmed in different experimental contexts , with no theory winning outright . 
 In one study , participants read a profile of a woman which described a mix of introverted and extroverted behaviors . They later had to recall examples of her introversion and extroversion . One group was told this was to assess the woman for a job as a librarian , while a second group were told it was for a job in real estate sales . There was a significant difference between what these two groups recalled , with the " librarian " group recalling more examples of introversion and the " sales " groups recalling more extroverted behavior . A selective memory effect has also been shown in experiments that manipulate the desirability of personality types . In one of these , a group of participants were shown evidence that extroverted people are more successful than <unk> . Another group were told the opposite . In a subsequent , apparently unrelated , study , they were asked to recall events from their lives in which they had been either introverted or extroverted . Each group of participants provided more memories connecting themselves with the more desirable personality type , and recalled those memories more quickly . 
 Changes in emotional states can also influence memory recall . Participants rated how they felt when they had first learned that O.J. Simpson had been acquitted of murder charges . They described their emotional reactions and confidence regarding the verdict one week , two months , and one year after the trial . Results indicated that participants ' assessments for Simpson 's guilt changed over time . The more that participants ' opinion of the verdict had changed , the less stable were the participant 's memories regarding their initial emotional reactions . When participants recalled their initial emotional reactions two months and a year later , past appraisals closely resembled current appraisals of emotion . People demonstrate sizable myside bias when discussing their opinions on controversial topics . Memory recall and construction of experiences undergo revision in relation to corresponding emotional states . 
 Myside bias has been shown to influence the accuracy of memory recall . In an experiment , widows and widowers rated the intensity of their experienced grief six months and five years after the deaths of their spouses . Participants noted a higher experience of grief at six months rather than at five years . Yet , when the participants were asked after five years how they had felt six months after the death of their significant other , the intensity of grief participants recalled was highly correlated with their current level of grief . Individuals appear to utilize their current emotional states to analyze how they must have felt when experiencing past events . Emotional memories are reconstructed by current emotional states . 
 One study showed how selective memory can maintain belief in extrasensory perception ( ESP ) . Believers and <unk> were each shown descriptions of ESP experiments . Half of each group were told that the experimental results supported the existence of ESP , while the others were told they did not . In a subsequent test , participants recalled the material accurately , apart from believers who had read the non @-@ supportive evidence . This group remembered significantly less information and some of them incorrectly remembered the results as supporting ESP . 
 = = Related effects = = 
 = = = Polarization of opinion = = = 
 When people with opposing views interpret new information in a biased way , their views can move even further apart . This is called " attitude polarization " . The effect was demonstrated by an experiment that involved drawing a series of red and black balls from one of two concealed " bingo baskets " . Participants knew that one basket contained 60 % black and 40 % red balls ; the other , 40 % black and 60 % red . The experimenters looked at what happened when balls of alternating color were drawn in turn , a sequence that does not favor either basket . After each ball was drawn , participants in one group were asked to state out loud their judgments of the probability that the balls were being drawn from one or the other basket . These participants tended to grow more confident with each successive draw — whether they initially thought the basket with 60 % black balls or the one with 60 % red balls was the more likely source , their estimate of the probability increased . Another group of participants were asked to state probability estimates only at the end of a sequence of drawn balls , rather than after each ball . They did not show the polarization effect , suggesting that it does not necessarily occur when people simply hold opposing positions , but rather when they openly commit to them . 
 A less abstract study was the Stanford biased interpretation experiment in which participants with strong opinions about the death penalty read about mixed experimental evidence . Twenty @-@ three percent of the participants reported that their views had become more extreme , and this self @-@ reported shift correlated strongly with their initial attitudes . In later experiments , participants also reported their opinions becoming more extreme in response to ambiguous information . However , comparisons of their attitudes before and after the new evidence showed no significant change , suggesting that the self @-@ reported changes might not be real . Based on these experiments , Deanna Kuhn and Joseph Lao concluded that polarization is a real phenomenon but far from inevitable , only happening in a small minority of cases . They found that it was prompted not only by considering mixed evidence , but by merely thinking about the topic . 
 Charles Taber and Milton Lodge argued that the Stanford team 's result had been hard to replicate because the arguments used in later experiments were too abstract or confusing to evoke an emotional response . The Taber and Lodge study used the emotionally charged topics of gun control and affirmative action . They measured the attitudes of their participants towards these issues before and after reading arguments on each side of the debate . Two groups of participants showed attitude polarization : those with strong prior opinions and those who were politically knowledgeable . In part of this study , participants chose which information sources to read , from a list prepared by the experimenters . For example , they could read the National Rifle Association 's and the Brady Anti @-@ Handgun Coalition 's arguments on gun control . Even when instructed to be even @-@ handed , participants were more likely to read arguments that supported their existing attitudes than arguments that did not . This biased search for information correlated well with the polarization effect . 
 The backfire effect is a name for the finding that , given evidence against their beliefs , people can reject the evidence and believe even more strongly . The phrase was first coined by Brendan Nyhan and Jason <unk> . 
 = = = Persistence of discredited beliefs = = = 
 Confirmation biases can be used to explain why some beliefs persist when the initial evidence for them is removed . This belief perseverance effect has been shown by a series of experiments using what is called the " debriefing paradigm " : participants read fake evidence for a hypothesis , their attitude change is measured , then the fakery is exposed in detail . Their attitudes are then measured once more to see if their belief returns to its previous level . 
 A common finding is that at least some of the initial belief remains even after a full debriefing . In one experiment , participants had to distinguish between real and fake suicide notes . The feedback was random : some were told they had done well while others were told they had performed badly . Even after being fully debriefed , participants were still influenced by the feedback . They still thought they were better or worse than average at that kind of task , depending on what they had initially been told . 
 In another study , participants read job performance ratings of two firefighters , along with their responses to a risk aversion test . This fictional data was arranged to show either a negative or positive association : some participants were told that a risk @-@ taking firefighter did better , while others were told they did less well than a risk @-@ averse colleague . Even if these two case studies were true , they would have been scientifically poor evidence for a conclusion about firefighters in general . However , the participants found them subjectively persuasive . When the case studies were shown to be fictional , participants ' belief in a link diminished , but around half of the original effect remained . Follow @-@ up interviews established that the participants had understood the debriefing and taken it seriously . Participants seemed to trust the debriefing , but regarded the discredited information as irrelevant to their personal belief . 
 The continued influence effect is the tendency to believe previously learned misinformation even after it has been corrected . Misinformation can still influence inferences one generates after a correction has occurred . 
 = = = Preference for early information = = = 
 Experiments have shown that information is weighted more strongly when it appears early in a series , even when the order is unimportant . For example , people form a more positive impression of someone described as " intelligent , industrious , impulsive , critical , stubborn , envious " than when they are given the same words in reverse order . This irrational primacy effect is independent of the primacy effect in memory in which the earlier items in a series leave a stronger memory trace . Biased interpretation offers an explanation for this effect : seeing the initial evidence , people form a working hypothesis that affects how they interpret the rest of the information . 
 One demonstration of irrational primacy used colored chips supposedly drawn from two urns . Participants were told the color distributions of the urns , and had to estimate the probability of a chip being drawn from one of them . In fact , the colors appeared in a pre @-@ arranged order . The first thirty draws favored one urn and the next thirty favored the other . The series as a whole was neutral , so rationally , the two urns were equally likely . However , after sixty draws , participants favored the urn suggested by the initial thirty . 
 Another experiment involved a slide show of a single object , seen as just a blur at first and in slightly better focus with each succeeding slide . After each slide , participants had to state their best guess of what the object was . Participants whose early guesses were wrong persisted with those guesses , even when the picture was sufficiently in focus that the object was readily recognizable to other people . 
 = = = Illusory association between events = = = 
 Illusory correlation is the tendency to see non @-@ existent correlations in a set of data . This tendency was first demonstrated in a series of experiments in the late 1960s . In one experiment , participants read a set of psychiatric case studies , including responses to the Rorschach <unk> test . The participants reported that the homosexual men in the set were more likely to report seeing buttocks , anuses or sexually ambiguous figures in the <unk> . In fact the fictional case studies had been constructed so that the homosexual men were no more likely to report this imagery or , in one version of the experiment , were less likely to report it than heterosexual men . In a survey , a group of experienced psychoanalysts reported the same set of illusory associations with homosexuality . 
 Another study recorded the symptoms experienced by arthritic patients , along with weather conditions over a 15 @-@ month period . Nearly all the patients reported that their pains were correlated with weather conditions , although the real correlation was zero . 
 This effect is a kind of biased interpretation , in that objectively neutral or unfavorable evidence is interpreted to support existing beliefs . It is also related to biases in hypothesis @-@ testing behavior . In judging whether two events , such as illness and bad weather , are correlated , people rely heavily on the number of positive @-@ positive cases : in this example , instances of both pain and bad weather . They pay relatively little attention to the other kinds of observation ( of no pain and / or good weather ) . This parallels the reliance on positive tests in hypothesis testing . It may also reflect selective recall , in that people may have a sense that two events are correlated because it is easier to recall times when they happened together . 
 = = Individual differences = = 
 Myside bias was once believed to be associated with greater intelligence ; however , studies have shown that myside bias can be more influenced by ability to rationally think as opposed to amount of intelligence . Myside bias can cause an inability to effectively and logically evaluate the opposite side of an argument . Studies have stated that myside bias is an absence of " active open @-@ mindedness , " meaning the active search for why an initial idea may be wrong . Typically , myside bias is <unk> in empirical studies as the quantity of evidence used in support of their side in comparison to the opposite side . 
 A study has found individual differences in myside bias . This study investigates individual differences that are acquired through learning in a cultural context and are mutable . The researcher found important individual difference in argumentation . Studies have suggested that individual differences such as deductive reasoning ability , ability to overcome belief bias , epistemological understanding , and thinking disposition are significant predictors of the reasoning and generating arguments , counterarguments , and rebuttals . 
 A study by Christopher Wolfe and Anne Britt also investigated how participants ' views of " what makes a good argument ? " can be a source of myside bias that influence the way a person creates their own arguments . The study investigated individual differences of argumentation schema and asked participants to write essays . The participants were randomly assigned to write essays either for or against their preferred side of an argument and were given research instructions that took either a balanced or an unrestricted approach . The balanced @-@ research instructions directed participants to create a " balanced " argument , i.e. , that included both pros and cons ; the unrestricted @-@ research instructions included nothing on how to create the argument . 
 Overall , the results revealed that the balanced @-@ research instructions significantly increased the incidence of opposing information in arguments . These data also reveal that personal belief is not a source of myside bias ; however , that those participants , who believe that a good argument is one that is based on facts , are more likely to exhibit myside bias than other participants . This evidence is consistent with the claims proposed in Baron 's article — that people 's opinions about what makes good thinking can influence how arguments are generated . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Informal observation = = = 
 Before psychological research on confirmation bias , the phenomenon had been observed anecdotally throughout history . Beginning with the Greek historian Thucydides ( c . 460 BC – c . 395 BC ) , who wrote of misguided treason in The Peloponnesian War ; " ... for it is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for , and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy . " Italian poet Dante Alighieri ( 1265 – 1321 ) , noted it in his famous work , the Divine Comedy , in which St. Thomas Aquinas cautions Dante upon meeting in Paradise , " opinion — hasty — often can incline to the wrong side , and then affection for one 's own opinion binds , confines the mind . " English philosopher and scientist Francis Bacon ( 1561 – 1626 ) , in the Novum Organum noted that biased assessment of evidence drove " all superstitions , whether in astrology , dreams , omens , divine judgments or the like " . He wrote : 
 The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion ... draws all things else to support and agree with it . And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side , yet these it either neglects or despises , or else by some distinction sets aside or rejects [ . ] 
 In his essay " What Is Art ? " , Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy wrote , 
 I know that most men — not only those considered clever , but even those who are very clever , and capable of understanding most difficult scientific , mathematical , or philosophic problems — can very seldom discern even the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as to oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions they have formed , perhaps with much difficulty — conclusions of which they are proud , which they have taught to others , and on which they have built their lives . 
 = = = Wason 's research on hypothesis @-@ testing = = = 
 The term " confirmation bias " was coined by English psychologist Peter Wason . For an experiment published in 1960 , he challenged participants to identify a rule applying to triples of numbers . At the outset , they were told that ( 2 @,@ 4 @,@ 6 ) fits the rule . Participants could generate their own triples and the experimenter told them whether or not each triple conformed to the rule . 
 While the actual rule was simply " any ascending sequence " , the participants had a great deal of difficulty in finding it , often announcing rules that were far more specific , such as " the middle number is the average of the first and last " . The participants seemed to test only positive examples — triples that obeyed their hypothesized rule . For example , if they thought the rule was , " Each number is two greater than its predecessor " , they would offer a triple that fit this rule , such as ( 11 @,@ 13 @,@ 15 ) rather than a triple that violates it , such as ( 11 @,@ 12 @,@ 19 ) . 
 Wason accepted <unk> , according to which a scientific test of a hypothesis is a serious attempt to falsify it . He interpreted his results as showing a preference for confirmation over falsification , hence the term " confirmation bias " . Wason also used confirmation bias to explain the results of his selection task experiment . In this task , participants are given partial information about a set of objects , and have to specify what further information they would need to tell whether or not a conditional rule ( " If A , then B " ) applies . It has been found repeatedly that people perform badly on various forms of this test , in most cases ignoring information that could potentially refute the rule . 
 = = = Klayman and Ha 's critique = = = 
 A 1987 paper by Joshua Klayman and Young @-@ Won Ha argued that the Wason experiments had not actually demonstrated a bias towards confirmation . Instead , Klayman and Ha interpreted the results in terms of a tendency to make tests that are consistent with the working hypothesis . They called this the " positive test strategy " . This strategy is an example of a heuristic : a reasoning shortcut that is imperfect but easy to compute . Klayman and Ha used Bayesian probability and information theory as their standard of hypothesis @-@ testing , rather than the <unk> used by Wason . According to these ideas , each answer to a question yields a different amount of information , which depends on the person 's prior beliefs . Thus a scientific test of a hypothesis is one that is expected to produce the most information . Since the information content depends on initial probabilities , a positive test can either be highly informative or uninformative . Klayman and Ha argued that when people think about realistic problems , they are looking for a specific answer with a small initial probability . In this case , positive tests are usually more informative than negative tests . However , in Wason 's rule discovery task the answer — three numbers in ascending order — is very broad , so positive tests are unlikely to yield informative answers . Klayman and Ha supported their analysis by citing an experiment that used the labels " <unk> " and " MED " in place of " fits the rule " and " doesn 't fit the rule " . This avoided implying that the aim was to find a low @-@ probability rule . Participants had much more success with this version of the experiment . 
 In light of this and other critiques , the focus of research moved away from confirmation versus falsification to examine whether people test hypotheses in an informative way , or an uninformative but positive way . The search for " true " confirmation bias led psychologists to look at a wider range of effects in how people process information . 
 = = Explanations = = 
 Confirmation bias is often described as a result of automatic , unintentional strategies rather than deliberate deception . According to Robert <unk> , most biased evidence processing occurs through a combination of both " cold " ( cognitive ) and " hot " ( motivated ) mechanisms . 
 Cognitive explanations for confirmation bias are based on limitations in people 's ability to handle complex tasks , and the shortcuts , called heuristics , that they use . For example , people may judge the reliability of evidence by using the availability heuristic — i.e. , how readily a particular idea comes to mind . It is also possible that people can only focus on one thought at a time , so find it difficult to test alternative hypotheses in parallel . Another heuristic is the positive test strategy identified by Klayman and Ha , in which people test a hypothesis by examining cases where they expect a property or event to occur . This heuristic avoids the difficult or impossible task of working out how diagnostic each possible question will be . However , it is not universally reliable , so people can overlook challenges to their existing beliefs . 
 Motivational explanations involve an effect of desire on belief , sometimes called " wishful thinking " . It is known that people prefer pleasant thoughts over unpleasant ones in a number of ways : this is called the " Pollyanna principle " . Applied to arguments or sources of evidence , this could explain why desired conclusions are more likely to be believed true . According to experiments that manipulate the desirability of the conclusion , people demand a high standard of evidence for unpalatable ideas and a low standard for preferred ideas . In other words , they ask , " Can I believe this ? " for some suggestions and , " Must I believe this ? " for others . Although consistency is a desirable feature of attitudes , an excessive drive for consistency is another potential source of bias because it may prevent people from neutrally evaluating new , surprising information . Social psychologist Ziva Kunda combines the cognitive and motivational theories , arguing that motivation creates the bias , but cognitive factors determine the size of the effect . 
 Explanations in terms of cost @-@ benefit analysis assume that people do not just test hypotheses in a disinterested way , but assess the costs of different errors . Using ideas from evolutionary psychology , James Friedrich suggests that people do not primarily aim at truth in testing hypotheses , but try to avoid the most costly errors . For example , employers might ask one @-@ sided questions in job interviews because they are focused on weeding out unsuitable candidates . Yaacov <unk> and Akiva Liberman 's refinement of this theory assumes that people compare the two different kinds of error : accepting a false hypothesis or rejecting a true hypothesis . For instance , someone who underestimates a friend 's honesty might treat him or her suspiciously and so undermine the friendship . <unk> the friend 's honesty may also be costly , but less so . In this case , it would be rational to seek , evaluate or remember evidence of their honesty in a biased way . When someone gives an initial impression of being introverted or extroverted , questions that match that impression come across as more empathic . This suggests that when talking to someone who seems to be an introvert , it is a sign of better social skills to ask , " Do you feel awkward in social situations ? " rather than , " Do you like noisy parties ? " The connection between confirmation bias and social skills was corroborated by a study of how college students get to know other people . Highly self @-@ monitoring students , who are more sensitive to their environment and to social norms , asked more matching questions when interviewing a high @-@ status staff member than when getting to know fellow students . 
 Psychologists Jennifer Lerner and Philip Tetlock distinguish two different kinds of thinking process . Exploratory thought neutrally considers multiple points of view and tries to anticipate all possible objections to a particular position , while confirmatory thought seeks to justify a specific point of view . Lerner and Tetlock say that when people expect to justify their position to others whose views they already know , they will tend to adopt a similar position to those people , and then use confirmatory thought to bolster their own credibility . However , if the external parties are overly aggressive or critical , people will disengage from thought altogether , and simply assert their personal opinions without justification . Lerner and Tetlock say that people only push themselves to think critically and logically when they know in advance they will need to explain themselves to others who are well @-@ informed , genuinely interested in the truth , and whose views they don 't already know . Because those conditions rarely exist , they argue , most people are using confirmatory thought most of the time .

 Confirmation bias can lead investors to be overconfident , ignoring evidence that their strategies will lose money . In studies of political stock markets , investors made more profit when they resisted bias . For example , participants who interpreted a candidate 's debate performance in a neutral rather than partisan way were more likely to profit . To combat the effect of confirmation bias , investors can try to adopt a contrary viewpoint " for the sake of argument " . In one technique , they imagine that their investments have collapsed and ask themselves why this might happen .

 Raymond Nickerson , a psychologist , blames confirmation bias for the ineffective medical procedures that were used for centuries before the arrival of scientific medicine . If a patient recovered , medical authorities counted the treatment as successful , rather than looking for alternative explanations such as that the disease had run its natural course . Biased assimilation is a factor in the modern appeal of alternative medicine , whose proponents are swayed by positive anecdotal evidence but treat scientific evidence hyper @-@ critically . 
 Cognitive therapy was developed by Aaron T. Beck in the early 1960s and has become a popular approach . According to Beck , biased information processing is a factor in depression . His approach teaches people to treat evidence impartially , rather than selectively reinforcing negative outlooks . <unk> and hypochondria have also been shown to involve confirmation bias for threatening information .

 Nickerson argues that reasoning in judicial and political contexts is sometimes subconsciously biased , favoring conclusions that judges , juries or governments have already committed to . Since the evidence in a jury trial can be complex , and jurors often reach decisions about the verdict early on , it is reasonable to expect an attitude polarization effect . The prediction that jurors will become more extreme in their views as they see more evidence has been borne out in experiments with mock trials . Both inquisitorial and adversarial criminal justice systems are affected by confirmation bias . 
 Confirmation bias can be a factor in creating or extending conflicts , from emotionally charged debates to wars : by interpreting the evidence in their favor , each opposing party can become overconfident that it is in the stronger position . On the other hand , confirmation bias can result in people ignoring or misinterpreting the signs of an imminent or incipient conflict . For example , psychologists Stuart Sutherland and Thomas Kida have each argued that US Admiral Husband E. Kimmel showed confirmation bias when playing down the first signs of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . 
 A two @-@ decade study of political pundits by Philip E. Tetlock found that , on the whole , their predictions were not much better than chance . Tetlock divided experts into " foxes " who maintained multiple hypotheses , and " hedgehogs " who were more dogmatic . In general , the hedgehogs were much less accurate . Tetlock blamed their failure on confirmation bias — specifically , their inability to make use of new information that contradicted their existing theories . 
 In the 2013 murder trial of David Camm , the defense argued that Camm was charged for the murders of his wife and two children solely because of confirmation bias within the investigation . Camm was arrested three days after the murders on the basis of faulty evidence . Despite the discovery that almost every piece of evidence on the probable cause affidavit was inaccurate or unreliable , the charges were not dropped against him . A sweatshirt found at the crime was subsequently discovered to contain the DNA of a convicted felon , his prison nickname , and his department of corrections number . Investigators looked for Camm 's DNA on the sweatshirt , but failed to investigate any other pieces of evidence found on it and the foreign DNA was not run through <unk> until 5 years after the crime . When the second suspect was discovered , prosecutors charged them as co @-@ conspirators in the crime despite finding no evidence linking the two men . Camm was acquitted of the murders .

 One factor in the appeal of alleged psychic readings is that listeners apply a confirmation bias which fits the psychic 's statements to their own lives . By making a large number of ambiguous statements in each sitting , the psychic gives the client more opportunities to find a match . This is one of the techniques of cold reading , with which a psychic can deliver a subjectively impressive reading without any prior information about the client . Investigator James Randi compared the transcript of a reading to the client 's report of what the psychic had said , and found that the client showed a strong selective recall of the " hits " . 
 As a striking illustration of confirmation bias in the real world , Nickerson mentions numerological <unk> : the practice of finding meaning in the proportions of the Egyptian pyramids . There are many different length measurements that can be made of , for example , the Great Pyramid of Giza and many ways to combine or manipulate them . Hence it is almost inevitable that people who look at these numbers selectively will find superficially impressive correspondences , for example with the dimensions of the Earth . 
 = = = In science = = = 
 A distinguishing feature of scientific thinking is the search for falsifying as well as confirming evidence . However , many times in the history of science , scientists have resisted new discoveries by selectively interpreting or ignoring unfavorable data . Previous research has shown that the assessment of the quality of scientific studies seems to be particularly vulnerable to confirmation bias . It has been found several times that scientists rate studies that report findings consistent with their prior beliefs more favorably than studies reporting findings inconsistent with their previous beliefs . However , assuming that the research question is relevant , the experimental design adequate and the data are clearly and comprehensively described , the found results should be of importance to the scientific community and should not be viewed <unk> , regardless of whether they conform to current theoretical predictions . 
 In the context of scientific research , confirmation biases can sustain theories or research programs in the face of inadequate or even contradictory evidence ; the field of parapsychology has been particularly affected . 
 An experimenter 's confirmation bias can potentially affect which data are reported . Data that conflict with the experimenter 's expectations may be more readily discarded as unreliable , producing the so @-@ called file drawer effect . To combat this tendency , scientific training teaches ways to prevent bias . For example , experimental design of randomized controlled trials ( coupled with their systematic review ) aims to minimize sources of bias . The social process of peer review is thought to mitigate the effect of individual scientists ' biases , even though the peer review process itself may be susceptible to such biases . Confirmation bias may thus be especially harmful to objective evaluations regarding nonconforming results since biased individuals may regard opposing evidence to be weak in principle and give little serious thought to revising their beliefs . Scientific innovators often meet with resistance from the scientific community , and research presenting controversial results frequently receives harsh peer review .

 Social psychologists have identified two tendencies in the way people seek or interpret information about themselves . Self @-@ verification is the drive to reinforce the existing self @-@ image and self @-@ enhancement is the drive to seek positive feedback . Both are served by confirmation biases . In experiments where people are given feedback that conflicts with their self @-@ image , they are less likely to attend to it or remember it than when given self @-@ verifying feedback . They reduce the impact of such information by interpreting it as unreliable . Similar experiments have found a preference for positive feedback , and the people who give it , over negative feedback . 
 = Hot chocolate = 
 Hot chocolate , also known as hot cocoa , drinking chocolate or just cocoa is a heated beverage consisting of shaved chocolate , melted chocolate or cocoa powder , heated milk or water , and often sugar . Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate , characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency . 
 The first chocolate beverage is believed to have been created by the Aztecs around 2 @,@ 000 years ago , and a cocoa beverage was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD . The beverage became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then . Until the 19th century , hot chocolate was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases . Today , hot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations , including the spiced chocolate para mesa of Latin America , the very thick <unk> densa served in Italy and chocolate a la <unk> served in Spain , and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States . 
 = = History = = 
 An early Classic period ( 460 @-@ 480 AD ) Mayan tomb from the site of Rio Azul , Guatemala , had vessels with the Maya glyph for cacao on them with residue of a chocolate drink . 
 To make the chocolate drink , which was served cold , the Maya ground cocoa seeds into a paste and mixed it with water , cornmeal , chili peppers , and other ingredients . They then poured the drink back and forth from a cup to a pot until a thick foam developed . Chocolate was available to Maya of all social classes , although the wealthy drank chocolate from elaborately decorated vessels . 
 What the Spaniards then called " <unk> " was said to be a beverage consisting of a chocolate base flavored with vanilla and other spices that was served cold . 
 Because sugar was yet to come to the Americas , xocolatl was said to be an acquired taste . The drink tasted spicy and bitter as opposed to sweetened modern hot chocolate . As to when xocolatl was first served hot , sources conflict on when and by whom . However , Jose de Acosta , a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century , described xocolatl as : 
 <unk> to such as are not acquainted with it , having a scum or froth that is very unpleasant taste . Yet it is a drink very much esteemed among the Indians , where with they feast noble men who pass through their country . The Spaniards , both men and women , that are accustomed to the country , are very greedy of this Chocolate . They say they make diverse sorts of it , some hot , some cold , and some temperate , and put therein much of that " chili " ; yea , they make paste thereof , the which they say is good for the stomach and against the catarrh . 
 = = = European adaptation = = = 
 After defeating Montezuma 's warriors and demanding that the Aztec nobles hand over their valuables , Cortés returned to Spain in 1528 , bringing cocoa beans and chocolate drink making equipment with them . At this time , chocolate still only existed in the bitter drink invented by the Mayas . Sweet hot chocolate and bar chocolate were yet to be invented . 
 After its introduction to Europe , the drink slowly gained popularity . The court of King Charles V soon adopted the drink , and what was then only known as " chocolate " became a fashionable drink popular with the Spanish upper class . Additionally , cocoa was given as a dowry when members of the Spanish Royal Family married other European aristocrats . At the time , chocolate was very expensive in Europe because the cocoa beans only grew in South America . 
 Sweet @-@ tasting hot chocolate was then invented , leading hot chocolate to become a luxury item among the European nobility by the 17th century . Even when the first Chocolate House ( an establishment similar to a modern coffee shop ) opened in 1657 , chocolate was still very expensive , costing 50 to 75 pence ( approximately 10 @-@ 15 shillings ) a pound . 
 In the late 17th century , Hans Sloane , president of the Royal College of Physicians , visited Jamaica . There , he tried chocolate and considered it " nauseous " , but found it became more palatable when mixed with milk . When he returned to England , he brought the recipe with him , introducing milk chocolate to England . 
 In 1828 , Coenraad Johannes van Houten developed the first cocoa powder producing machine in the Netherlands . The press separated the greasy cocoa butter from cacao seeds , leaving a purer chocolate powder behind . This powder , much like instant cocoa powder used today , was easier to stir into milk and water . As a result , another very important discovery was made : solid chocolate . By using cocoa powder and low amounts of cocoa butter , it was then possible to manufacture bar chocolate . The term " chocolate " then came to mean solid chocolate , rather than hot chocolate . 
 = = Terminology = = 
 A distinction is sometimes made between " hot cocoa " , made from powder made by removing most of the rich cocoa butter from the ground cacao beans , and " hot chocolate " , made directly from bar chocolate , which already contains cocoa , sugar , and cocoa butter . Thus , the major difference between the two is the cocoa butter , the absence of which makes hot cocoa significantly lower in fat than hot chocolate while still preserving all the antioxidants found in chocolate . 
 Hot chocolate can be made with dark , <unk> , or bittersweet chocolate chopped into small pieces and stirred into milk with the addition of sugar . American instant hot cocoa powder often includes powdered milk or other dairy ingredients so it can be made without using milk . In the United Kingdom , " hot chocolate " is a sweet chocolate drink made with hot milk or water , and powder containing chocolate , sugar , and powdered milk . " Cocoa " usually refers to a similar drink made with just hot milk and cocoa powder , then sweetened to taste with sugar ( or not sweetened at all ) .

 Today , hot chocolate in the form of drinking chocolate or cocoa is considered a comfort food and is widely consumed in many parts of the world . 
 = = = Europe = = = 
 In mainland Europe ( particularly Spain and Italy ) , hot chocolate is sometimes served very thick due to the use of a thickening agent such as cornstarch . Among the multiple thick forms of hot chocolate served in Europe is the Italian <unk> densa . German variations are also known for being very thick and heavy . 
 Hot chocolate with churros is the traditional working @-@ man 's breakfast in Spain . This style of hot chocolate can be extremely thick , often having the consistency of warm chocolate pudding . In the Netherlands , hot chocolate is a very popular drink , known as <unk> , it is often served at home or in cafes . In France , hot chocolate is often served at breakfast time ; sometimes sliced bread spread with butter , jam , honey , or Nutella is dunked into the hot chocolate . There are also brands of hot chocolate specially formulated for breakfast time , notably <unk> . 
 Even further variations of hot chocolate exist . In some cafes in Belgium and other areas in Europe , one who orders a " <unk> <unk> " or " chocolat <unk> " receives a cup of steaming white milk and a small bowl of bittersweet chocolate chips to dissolve in the milk . Particularly rich hot chocolate is often served in <unk> cups . 
 = = = North America = = = 
 In the United States , the drink is popular in instant form , made with hot water or milk from a packet containing mostly cocoa powder , sugar , and dry milk . This is the thinner of the two main variations . It is very sweet and may be topped with marshmallows , whipped cream , or a piece of solid chocolate . Hot chocolate was first brought to North America as early as the 17th century by the Dutch , but the first time colonists began selling hot chocolate was around 1755 . Traditionally , hot chocolate has been associated with cold weather , winter , and dessert in the United States . 
 In Mexico , hot chocolate remains a popular national drink . Besides the instant powder form , traditional Mexican hot chocolate includes semi @-@ sweet chocolate , cinnamon , sugar , and vanilla . Hot chocolate of this type is commonly sold in circular or hexagonal tablets which can be dissolved into hot milk , water , or cream , and then blended until the mixture develops a creamy froth . Mexican cinnamon hot chocolate is traditionally served alongside a variety of Mexican pastries known as pan dulce or with churros .

 In Colombia , a hot chocolate beverage made with milk and water using a <unk> and <unk> is enjoyed as part of breakfast with bread and soft , fresh farmers cheese . The chocolate bars used in the preparation come with granulated sugar mixed in , and sometimes have flavors such as cinnamon , cloves and vanilla added to the chocolate . 
 In Peru , hot chocolate can be served with <unk> at breakfast on Christmas Day , even though summer has already started in the southern hemisphere . This tradition began in Cuzco ; for this reason typical brands of chocolate bars are from this cocoa @-@ producing region . Another region which produces best @-@ quality cacao is the San Martin Region in the north Peruvian rainforest . 
 = = Health = = 
 Although hot chocolate is generally consumed for pleasure , the beverage confers several potential health benefits . A 2003 study from Cornell University found that cocoa contains large amounts of antioxidants that may help prevent cancer . Also , it has been demonstrated that the cocoa bean helps with digestion . From the 16th to 19th centuries , hot chocolate was valued as a medicine as well as a drink . 
 The explorer Francisco Hernández wrote that chocolate beverages helped treat fever and liver disease . Another explorer , Santiago de Valverde <unk> , believed that large amounts of hot chocolate were helpful in treating chest ailments and that smaller amounts could help stomach disorders . When chocolate was introduced to the French in the 17th century , it was reportedly used " to fight against fits of anger and bad moods " , which may be attributed to chocolate 's phenylethylamine content . Today , hot chocolate is consumed for pleasure rather than medicinally , but new research suggests that there may be other health benefits attributed to the drink . 
 On the other hand , several negative effects can be attributed to drinking hot chocolate , as some hot chocolate recipes contain high amounts of sugar , hydrogenated oils , or fats . 
 = = = Benefits = = = 
 Research has shown that the consumption of hot chocolate can be positive to one 's health . A study conducted by Cornell University has shown that hot chocolate contains more antioxidants than wine and tea , therefore reducing the risk of heart disease . In a single serving of cocoa , the researchers found 611 milligrams of gallic acid equivalents ( GAE ) and 564 milligrams of <unk> equivalents ( ECE ) , compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine , and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in green tea . Chang Yong Lee , the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study , revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the beverage is heated . 
 The flavonoids found in the cocoa that makes up hot chocolate also have a positive effect on arterial health . A particular study performed by the National Institutes of Health partially supported by Mars Chocolate company showed high amounts of improvement in blood flow after drinking a <unk> @-@ rich cocoa beverage . In the study , the subjects ( 27 people ages 18 to 72 ) drank a cocoa drink containing 900 milligrams of flavonols every day , which resulted in an improvement in blood flow and the function of endothelial cells that line blood vessels . 
 In further studies conducted by Dr. Norman K. <unk> , professor of medicine at Brigham and Women 's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols may also help vessels dilate and help keep platelets from clustering on the blood vessel walls . <unk> found in hot chocolate are beneficial to health mainly because they shield the walls of blood vessels from free radical damage . <unk> are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids , which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health . 
 = = = Risks = = = 
 Several negative effects may be attributed to the drinking of hot chocolate . The types and severity of health risks vary between different styles of hot chocolate . Hot chocolate made from milk also contains the sugars naturally found in milk . Processed cocoa powder usually contains additional sugars . Some brands also contain hydrogenated oils and fats , the most common of which are coconut derivatives . 
 = Moons of Haumea = 
 The outer Solar System dwarf planet Haumea has two known moons , Hiʻiaka and Namaka , named after Hawaiian goddesses . These small moons were discovered in 2005 , from observations of Haumea made at the large telescopes of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii . 
 Haumea 's moons are unusual in a number of ways . They are thought to be part of its extended collisional family , which formed billions of years ago from icy debris after a large impact disrupted Haumea 's ice mantle . Hiʻiaka , the larger , outermost moon , has large amounts of pure water ice on its surface , which is rare among Kuiper belt objects . Namaka , about one tenth the mass , has an orbit with surprising dynamics : it is unusually eccentric and appears to be greatly influenced by the larger satellite . 
 = = History = = 
 Two small satellites were discovered around Haumea ( which was at that time still designated 2003 EL61 ) through observations using the W.M. Keck Observatory by a Caltech team in 2005 . The outer and larger of the two satellites was discovered January 26 , 2005 , and formally designated S / 2005 ( 2003 EL61 ) 1 , though nicknamed " Rudolph " by the Caltech team . The smaller , inner satellite of Haumea was discovered on June 30 , 2005 , formally termed S / 2005 ( 2003 EL61 ) 2 , and nicknamed " Blitzen " . On September 7 , 2006 , both satellites were numbered and admitted into the official minor planet catalogue as ( 136108 ) 2003 EL61 I and II , respectively . 
 The permanent names of these moons were announced , together with that of 2003 EL61 , by the International Astronomical Union on September 17 , 2008 : ( 136108 ) Haumea I Hiʻiaka and ( 136108 ) Haumea II Namaka . Each moon was named after a daughter of Haumea , the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth . Hiʻiaka is the goddess of dance and patroness of the Big Island of Hawaii , where the Mauna Kea Observatory is located . Nāmaka is the goddess of water and the sea ; she cooled her sister Pele 's lava as it flowed into the sea , turning it into new land . 
 In her legend , Haumea 's many children came from different parts of her body . The dwarf planet Haumea appears to be almost entirely made of rock , with only a superficial layer of ice ; most of the original icy mantle is thought to have been blasted off by the impact that spun Haumea into its current high speed of rotation , where the material formed into the small Kuiper belt objects in Haumea 's collisional family . There could therefore be additional outer moons , smaller than Namaka , that have not yet been detected . However , HST observations have confirmed that no other moons brighter than 0 @.@ 25 % of the brightness of Haumea exist within the closest tenth of the distance ( 0 @.@ 1 % of the volume ) where they could be held by Haumea 's gravitational influence ( its Hill sphere ) . This makes it unlikely that any more exist . 
 = = Surface properties = = 
 Hiʻiaka is the outer and , at roughly 350 km in diameter , the larger and brighter of the two moons . Strong absorption features observed at 1 @.@ 5 , 1 @.@ 65 and 2 µm in its infrared spectrum are consistent with nearly pure crystalline water ice covering much of its surface . The unusual spectrum , and its similarity to absorption lines in the spectrum of Haumea , led Brown and colleagues to conclude that it was unlikely that the system of moons was formed by the gravitational capture of passing Kuiper belt objects into orbit around the dwarf planet : instead , the Haumean moons must be fragments of Haumea itself . 
 The sizes of both moons are calculated with the assumption that they have the same infrared albedo as Haumea , which is reasonable as their spectra show them to have the same surface composition . Haumea 's albedo has been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope : from ground @-@ based telescopes , the moons are too small and close to Haumea to be seen independently . Based on this common albedo , the inner moon , Namaka , which is a tenth the mass of Hiʻiaka , would be about 170 km in diameter . 
 The Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) has adequate angular resolution to separate the light from the moons from that of Haumea . Photometry of the Haumea triple system with HST 's NICMOS camera has confirmed that the spectral line at 1 @.@ 6 µm that indicates the presence of water ice is at least as strong in the moons ' spectra as in Haumea 's spectrum . 
 The moons of Haumea are too faint to detect with telescopes smaller than about 2 metres in aperture , though Haumea itself has a visual magnitude of 17 @.@ 5 , making it the third brightest object in the Kuiper belt after Pluto and Makemake , and easily observable with a large amateur telescope . 
 = = Orbital characteristics = = 
 Hiʻiaka orbits Haumea nearly circularly every 49 days . Namaka orbits Haumea in 18 days in a moderately elliptical , non @-@ Keplerian orbit , and as of 2008 was inclined 13 ° with respect to Hiʻiaka , which perturbs its orbit . Because the impact that created the moons of Haumea is thought to have occurred in the early history of the Solar System , over the following billions of years it should have been tidally damped into a more circular orbit . Namaka 's orbit has likely been disturbed by orbital resonances with the more @-@ massive Hiʻiaka due to converging orbits as they moved outward from Haumea due to tidal dissipation . They may have been caught in and then escaped from orbital resonance several times ; they currently are in or at least close to an 8 : 3 resonance . This resonance strongly perturbs Namaka 's orbit , which has a current precession of its argument of periapsis by about − 6 @.@ 5 ° per year , a precession period of 55 years . 
 At present , the orbits of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge @-@ on from Earth , with Namaka having periodically occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011 . Observation of such transits would provide precise information on the size and shape of Haumea and its moons , as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon . The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations will require at least a medium @-@ aperture professional telescope for detection . Hiʻiaka last occulted Haumea in 1999 , a few years before its discovery , and will not do so again for some 130 years . However , in a situation unique among regular satellites , the great <unk> of Namaka 's orbit by Hiʻiaka will preserve the viewing angle of Namaka – Haumea transits for several more years . 
 = Kingdom of Loathing = 
 Kingdom of Loathing ( abbreviated KoL ) is a browser @-@ based multiplayer role @-@ playing game designed and operated by Asymmetric Publications , including creator Zack " Jick " Johnson and writer Josh " Mr <unk> " Nite . The game was released in 2003 . Because content is added frequently , the game is considered unfinished and officially remains in open beta . 
 It uses hand @-@ drawn stick figure graphics and writing characterized by surreal humor , word play , parody and references to popular culture . In KoL , a player 's character fights monsters for experience , and acquiring meat ( the game 's currency ) , and / or items , through a turn @-@ based system . Players may also interact with each other through player versus player competition , participate in the in @-@ game economy by trading goods and services , organize their characters into clans , work together to complete clan dungeons , and speak to each other in many different chat channels . 
 The game is also particularly notable for managing to be financially successful purely from donations and the purchase of merchandise rather than from advertising or subscription fees , which are used by many online games . In 2008 , the game had between 100 @,@ 000 and 150 @,@ 000 regular players . These players form an active community which frequently organizes fan meet @-@ ups and runs an internet radio station . The game has been generally well received by critics . In 2012 , Mr. Card Game , a tabletop game based on Kingdom of Loathing , was launched on Kickstarter . 
 = = Gameplay and features = = 
 Gameplay involves fighting monsters , completing quests , gaining skills and stats , and accumulating items and meat . 
 In KoL 's turn @-@ based gameplay , a player 's character is supplied with a number of adventures each day , at a base of 40 , although this can be increased . The game day resets at a time called " rollover " . Characters are allotted forty adventures every rollover , though they can increase that number with various equipment and items . Additional adventures can be acquired by consuming food and booze . However , only a limited amount of each can be consumed each day , and drinking too much booze puts the character into a drunken stupor for the remainder of the day . During rollover , drunkenness and fullness levels are reset , and minor amounts of health points and magic points are restored . Although a character can accumulate a large number of adventures , the number is reduced to 200 at rollover . 
 Most actions in the game use up adventures , including crafting items and exploring the game world ( adventuring ) . When exploring , players experience combat encounters , in which they fight monsters , as well as non @-@ combat encounters . Combat is turn @-@ based , meaning that the player and the monster take turns attacking one another using weapons , skills and items . Players who successfully defeat a monster receive experience points , pieces of meat ( the game 's currency ) , and various items . Non @-@ combat encounters simply present the reader with a text description of an event , occasionally allowing the player to choose how to respond to that event . 
 After gaining enough experience points , players will gain levels , allowing them to access new areas and quests . Characters can combine items by using " meat paste " ( a substance analogous to glue ) , and can also cook food , mix cocktails and smith weapons and armor . Characters may also earn trophies or tattoos for various in @-@ game achievements . Puzzle @-@ solving is an important part of the game , with the solutions often involving a certain item combination or the completion of tasks in different zones . 
 = = = Player interaction = = = 
 While Kingdom of Loathing 's player versus environment content is largely single @-@ player , some features allow multiplayer interaction . 
 Player versus player ( PvP ) combat is voluntary , features a randomized selection of non @-@ interactive minigames , and is subdivided into seasons . The winner of the PvP battle can take fame or items from the loser . 
 The game features an integrated chat system which is available only after completing a basic test of English grammar and spelling . There are many chat channels , including a channel in which all chat must follow the syllabic conventions of English haiku . Most of the chat channels are moderated ; those who violate the chat rules are banned . Players can also send messages and gift packages to each other in @-@ game , and the official Kingdom of Loathing forums are another active venue for discussion among players . 
 Upon reaching level 3 , characters may join a clan , a band of cooperating characters . A clan has a clan hall which can be furnished with beneficial equipment as well as a clan stash for sharing useful items . Clan members can chat with each other in a private chat channel . In 2008 , a multiplayer dungeon was added which allows clan members to raid cooperatively in <unk> , the underground city of hobos . Eurogamer likened <unk> to World of Warcraft instances . Additional clan dungeons have since been added , including the <unk> , <unk> , and the limited @-@ time Haunted Sorority House . 
 Players can buy a store in The Mall of Loathing and sell their character 's items to other players . Direct trading between two players is also possible , and in the trade chat channel users can auction items and advertise shops . This functionality has created a complex in @-@ game economy which author Ted Friedman , in his book Electric dreams : computers in American culture , described as " vibrant " . The Kingdom of Loathing economy was the subject of an academic study , Economics in the Kingdom of Loathing : Analysis of Virtual Market Data in 2011 .

Characters also receive non @-@ tradable class @-@ dependent items as a reward for completing harder ascensions . The classes can be split into groups based on the primary character attribute associated with them . 
 Muscle classes : The two muscle classes are Seal <unk> and Turtle Tamer . Muscle classes depend on strength and fighting ability . A character 's Max HP is determined by his / her muscle , and Muscle classes gain an innate + 50 % boost to their Max <unk> 
 Mysticality classes : The <unk> classes are <unk> and <unk> . Gameplay for <unk> classes is focused on spellcasting and the use of magic . A character 's Max MP is determined by his / her Mysticality , and Mysticality classes gain an innate + 50 % to their Max MP .
