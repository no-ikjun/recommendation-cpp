 Mysore is connected by National Highway NH @-@ 212 to the state border town of <unk> , where the road forks into the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu . State Highway 17 , which connects Mysore to Bangalore , was upgraded to a four @-@ lane highway in 2006 , reducing travel time between the two cities . A project was planned in 1994 to construct a new expressway to connect Bangalore and Mysore . After numerous legal hurdles , it remains unfinished as of 2012 . State Highways 33 and 88 which connect Mysore to H D Kote and Madikeri respectively . The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation ( KSRTC ) and other private agencies operate buses both within the city and between cities . A new division of KSRTC called Mysore City Transport Corporation ( <unk> ) has been proposed . Within the city , buses are cheap and popular means of transport , auto @-@ rickshaws are also available and <unk> ( horse @-@ drawn carriages ) are popular with tourists .

 Mysore railway station has three lines , connecting it to Bangalore , Hassan and <unk> . The first railway line established in the city was the Bangalore – Mysore Junction metre gauge line , which was commissioned in 1882 . All railway lines that serve the city are single track at some points and the rest of the stretch is double track , impeding faster connections to the city . All trains that connect to Mysore are operated by South Western Railway Zone , Hubli of Indian Railways . The fastest train to serve the city is the <unk> Express .

 Newspaper publishing in Mysore started in 1859 when <unk> <unk> began publishing a weekly newspaper in Kannada called the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the first of a number of weekly newspapers published in the following three decades . A well @-@ known Mysore publisher during Wodeyar rule was M. <unk> , known as the father of Kannada journalism , who started several news magazines . Many local newspapers are published in Mysore and carry news mostly related to the city and its surroundings , and national and regional dailies in English and Kannada are available , as in the other parts of the state . <unk> , the only Indian daily newspaper in Sanskrit , is published in Mysore . 
 Mysore was the location of the first private radio broadcasting station in India when <unk> ( voice from the sky ) was established in the city on 10 September 1935 by M.V. Gopalaswamy , a professor of psychology , at his house in the <unk> area of Mysore , using a 50 @-@ watt transmitter . The station was taken over by the princely state of Mysore in 1941 and was moved to Bangalore in 1955 . In 1957 , <unk> was chosen as the official name of All India Radio ( AIR ) , the radio broadcaster of the Government of India . The AIR station at Mysore broadcasts an FM radio channel at 100 @.@ 6 MHz , and Gyan Vani broadcasts on 105 @.@ 2 . BIG FM and Red FM are the two private FM channels operating in the city . 
 Mysore started receiving television broadcasts in the early 1980s , when Doordarshan ( public service broadcaster of the Indian government ) started broadcasting its national channel all over India . This was the only channel available to <unk> until Star TV started satellite channels in 1991 . Direct @-@ to @-@ home channels are now available in Mysore .

 The Wodeyar kings of Mysore were patrons of games and sports . King Krishnaraja Wodeyar III had a passion for indoor games . He invented new board games and popularised the <unk> card game . Malla @-@ yuddha ( traditional wrestling ) has a history in Mysore dating back to the 16th century . The wrestling competition held in Mysore during the Dasara celebrations attracts wrestlers from all over India . An annual sports meeting is organised there during the Dasara season too . 
 In 1997 Mysore and Bangalore co @-@ hosted the city 's biggest sports event ever , the National Games of India . Mysore was the venue for six sports : archery , gymnastics , equestrianism , handball , table tennis and wrestling . Cricket is by far the most popular sport in Mysore . The city has four established cricket grounds , but is yet to host an international cricket match . Javagal Srinath , who represented India for several years as its frontline fast bowler , comes from Mysore . Other prominent sportsmen from the city are Prahlad Srinath , who has represented India in Davis Cup tennis tournaments ; <unk> Abraham , a national champion in the heptathlon and a long jump record holder ; Sagar Kashyap , the youngest Indian to officiate at the Wimbledon Championships ; and Rahul Ganapathy , a national amateur golf champion . The Mysore race course hosts a racing season each year from August through October . India 's first youth hostel was formed in the Maharaja 's College Hostel in 1949 .

 = The Number of the Beast ( album ) = 
 The Number of the Beast is the third studio album by the English heavy metal band Iron Maiden , released in March 1982 . It was their first release to feature vocalist Bruce Dickinson and their last with the late drummer Clive Burr . 
 The Number of the Beast met with considerable critical and commercial success and was a landmark release for the band — becoming their first album to reach No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart , and be certified platinum in the US . The album also produced the singles " Run to the Hills " and " The Number of the Beast " , the former of which was the band 's first top @-@ ten UK single . The album was also controversial , particularly in the US , due to the religious nature of its lyrics and its artwork . 
 Since the release of The Number of the Beast and its subsequent tour , The Beast on the Road , " The Beast " has become an alternate name for Iron Maiden and was later used in the titles of some of their compilations and live releases , including Best of the Beast and Visions of the Beast . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 The Number of the Beast is Iron Maiden 's only album to include songwriting credits from Clive Burr and was the band 's first album to feature writing by guitarist Adrian Smith . In addition , the release saw Steve Harris adopt a different approach to writing , which would cater more for new vocalist Bruce Dickinson . The album 's producer Martin Birch remarked , " I simply didn 't think [ former vocalist Paul Di 'Anno ] was capable of handling lead vocals on some of the quite complicated directions I knew Steve wanted to explore ... When Bruce joined , it opened up the possibilities for the new album tremendously . " 
 According to several interviews , Dickinson was heavily involved in writing several of the album 's songs , and in particular the tracks " Children of the Damned " , " The Prisoner " and " Run to the Hills " . Due to his previous band Samson 's ongoing contractual issues , Dickinson could not legally take part in any songwriting for the record , and had to make what he called a " moral contribution " , which meant he was able to influence particular tracks , but not provide enough creative input so as to earn a writing credit . The recording and mixing of the album had to be completed in only five weeks , after the band had spent too long constructing the new songs . This was because the group were for the first time creating a new album from scratch , with very little material written prior to the record 's pre @-@ production stage . 
 Music press reports told stories of unexplained phenomena occurring during the sessions at Battery Studios , such as lights turning on and off of their own accord and the recording gear mysteriously breaking down . This all climaxed when Birch was involved in a car accident with a mini @-@ bus transporting a group of nuns , after which he was presented with a repair bill for £ 666 . 
 = = Songs = = 
 " Run to the Hills " was released as a single on 12 February 1982 , two weeks before Iron Maiden 's UK tour , acting as a preview for the forthcoming album , which would not be released until two days after the British dates ended . Released alongside a music video , made using live footage and clips from Buster Keaton films , the single performed remarkably well , earning the band their first top ten in the UK Singles Chart . As they were rushing to complete the album in time , as well as record and mix the single for an even earlier release , the band hastily selected " Total Eclipse " as the B @-@ side . 
 As they had written too much material , they had to choose between " Total Eclipse " and " Gangland " for the " Run to the Hills " single release , with the understanding that the other song would make it onto the album . Several band @-@ members have since expressed regret over the decision , with Steve Harris commenting , " We just chose the wrong track as the B @-@ side . I think if ' Total Eclipse ' had been on the album instead of ' Gangland ' it would have been far better . " On top of this , Harris has stated that the record 's opening track , " Invaders " , was not good enough , commenting that it " could have been replaced with something a bit better , only we didn 't have anything else to replace it with at the time . We had just enough time to do what we did , and that was it . " 
 While the title track was considered by many religious groups in the United States as evidence that Iron Maiden were a Satanic band , the song was in fact inspired by a nightmare bassist Steve Harris had , triggered by watching the film Damien : Omen II late at night . In addition , Harris has stated that the lyrics were also influenced by Robert Burns ' Tam o ' Shanter . The track opens with a spoken introduction from the Book of Revelation , read by actor Barry Clayton . According to Dickinson , the band originally approached actor Vincent Price to record the passage , but asked Clayton after Price insisted on a fee of £ 25 @,@ 000 . Although the liner notes state that the passage is from Revelations 13 : 18 , the first line comes from 12 : 12 . 
 The closing song " Hallowed Be Thy Name " has remained in all but one of the band 's setlists since the album 's recording ( the only exception being the Maiden England World Tour 2012 – 14 ) . AllMusic describes the track as " perhaps the most celebrated of the band 's extended epics ; it 's the tale of a prisoner about to be hanged , featuring some of Harris ' most philosophical lyrics . " Several band @-@ members have since stated that it is one of their favourite tracks , with Dickinson describing it as " fantastic " and that performing it live is like " narrating a movie to the audience . " A live version of the song was released in 1993 , gaining the band another top ten placement in the UK Singles Chart . 
 " Children of the Damned " is based on the films Village of the Damned and Children of the Damned , which in turn were adapted from the novel The <unk> Cuckoos by John Wyndham . On his last radio show for BBC Radio 6 , during a segment in tribute to the late Ronnie James Dio , Dickinson mentioned that Children of the Damned was inspired by Black Sabbath 's " Children of the Sea " . 
 " The Prisoner " was inspired by the British TV show of the same name , and features dialogue from its title sequence . The band 's manager , Rod Smallwood , had to telephone Patrick McGoohan to ask permission to use the audio clips for the song and was extremely hesitant during his conversation with whom Smallwood himself describes as " a real bona fide superstar actor " . McGoohan was reported to have said " What did you say the name was ? A rock band , you say ? Do it . " Iron Maiden later made another song based on the series , " Back in the Village " from 1984 's Powerslave . 
 " 22 Acacia Avenue " is the second song in the " Charlotte the Harlot " saga , which was originally written by Adrian Smith several years earlier , while playing in his old band , Urchin . According to Smith , Steve Harris remembered hearing the song at an Urchin concert in a local park , and modified it for The Number of the Beast album . 
 = = Reception and controversy = = 
 The album was strongly opposed by social conservatives – especially in the United States , where Iron Maiden were accused of being Satanists . Public burnings of the band 's catalogue were organised , although some religious groups smashed the records with hammers , for fear of inhaling fumes from burning vinyl . The Beast on the Road tour was subject to numerous boycotts and demonstrations : venues were sometimes surrounded by activists who handed out leaflets and , in one case , a 25 @-@ foot cross was carried in protest . Harris has stated , " It was mad . They completely got the wrong end of the stick . They obviously hadn 't read the lyrics . They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists . " 
 Since its release , the album has received consistent critical acclaim , with AllMusic describing it as " among the top five most essential heavy metal albums ever recorded . A cornerstone of the genre . " Sputnikmusic calls it " a classic in the world of metal " , while BBC Music praised the record 's complex arrangements , stating " Whereas even some of the venerable HM institutions ( think Black Sabbath ) would struggle to make material that was something more than a collection of minor @-@ key riffs , Iron Maiden pull this feat off with considerable élan . " Q magazine placed the album at No. 100 in its list of the " 100 Greatest British Albums Ever " in 2000 ; in 2001 named it one of the " 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time " ; and in 2006 placed it at No. 40 in its " 40 Best Albums of the ' 80s " list . IGN and Metal Rules placed it third and second , respectively , in their lists of the Top Heavy Metal Albums , and Guitar World ranked it at No. 17 on their list of " 100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time " . Classic Rock placed it at No. 15 in their list of the " 100 Greatest British Rock Albums " , describing it as " the most important metal album of the decade " , and it was voted No. 1 in HMV 's list of " The Best British Albums of the Past 60 Years " in 2012 . The Number of the Beast is one of two Iron Maiden records listed in Robert Dimery 's book , 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die ( 1980 's Iron Maiden being the other ) . 
 In 2001 , the BBC made a documentary about The Number of the Beast as part of the Classic Albums series , which was released on DVD in the same year . 
 = = Album artwork = = 
 Like all of Iron Maiden 's album artwork during the 1980s and early 90s , it was painted by Derek Riggs . The cover was originally created for the song " Purgatory " , but Rod Smallwood deemed it of too high a calibre for a single release and decided to save it for The Number of the Beast album instead . The original 1982 artwork includes a blue sky in the background ; this was a mistake by the printers of the album cover , and was later rectified and became black when the album was remastered for compact disc in 1998 . 
 The album was also the centre of controversy , particularly in the United States , due to the lyrics of the title track and the cover art depicting Eddie controlling Satan like a puppet , while Satan is also controlling a smaller Eddie . Smallwood explains that the concept was to ask " who 's the really evil one here ? Who 's manipulating who ? " According to Riggs this was inspired by a Doctor Strange comic book " which had some big villain with Doctor Strange dangling on some strings like a puppet , it was something I read as a child back in the 1960s I think " , while the images of hell were " taken from my knowledge of medieval European Christian art which was full of such scenes . " 
 The album 's cover art has been parodied several times – by crossover thrash band Stormtroopers of Death for the cover art of their 1999 album Bigger than the Devil , and on a T @-@ shirt by <unk> brand Diamond Supply Co .

 On 24 October 2002 , progressive metal outfit Dream Theater played the original album in its entirety at La <unk> in Paris , France . The performance was recorded and has been released through the band 's YtseJam Records label . 
 " Run to the Hills " was covered on the tribute album Numbers From The Beast , featuring vocalist Robin McAuley , guitarists Michael Schenker and Pete Fletcher , bassist Tony Franklin and drummer Brian Tichy . A Tribute to the Beast , Vol . 2 features covers of " Children of the Damned " , by Sebastian Bach of Skid Row fame , and " Hallowed Be Thy Name " , by Iced Earth , who have also covered " Hallowed Be Thy Name " and " The Number of the Beast " on their own album , Tribute to the Gods . " Hallowed Be Thy Name " has also been covered by Machine Head on Maiden Heaven : A Tribute To Iron Maiden , which was released by Kerrang ! magazine in 2008 , and by Cradle of Filth , while the title track has also been covered by <unk> Zwan on the soundtrack of the film Spun .

In addition , " The Number of the Beast " ( as the original master recording ) , " Run to the Hills " and " Hallowed Be Thy Name " ( the latter being a live recording found on Flight 666 ) were made downloadable to Rock Band on 8 June 2009 .

 The Number of the Beast was released on 22 March 1982 through EMI and its sister label Capitol in the United States . The album was reissued in 1995 with a bonus CD containing two songs ( " Total Eclipse " , and a live version of " Remember Tomorrow " ) that had been the b @-@ sides of the album 's two singles . The US version of the 1995 reissue incorrectly gives Paul Di 'Anno a song @-@ writing credit for " Total Eclipse " ; the song had actually been written by Harris , Murray , and Burr . 
 The album was also reissued in 1998 by EMI and Sanctuary / Columbia in the US as an enhanced CD version , which included photos , band history and the music videos for the songs " The Number of the Beast " and " Run to the Hills " , in addition to " Total Eclipse " , which was restored to the album 's track listing ( having been excluded from the original edition due to space constraints ) . This version mistakenly lists the track lengths for " 22 Acacia Avenue " and " The Number of the Beast " as 4 : 49 and 3 : 50 ; they are in fact 6 : 38 and 4 : 51 , respectively .

 = A History of British Birds ( 1843 ) = 
 William Yarrell 's A History of British Birds was first published as a whole in three volumes in 1843 , having been serialized , three sheets every two months , over the previous six years . It is not a history of ornithology but a natural history , a handbook or field guide systematically describing every species of bird known to occur in Britain . A separate article of about six pages , containing an image , a description , and an account of worldwide distribution , together with reports of behaviour , is provided for each species . 
 It quickly became the standard reference work for a generation of British ornithologists , replacing Thomas Bewick 's book of the same name through its increased scientific accuracy , but following Bewick in its mixture of scientific data , accurate illustrations , detailed descriptions and varied anecdotes , as well as in the use of small ' tail @-@ piece ' engravings at the ends of articles . This made the book attractive to the public as well as to specialists . Yarrell , a newsagent without university education , corresponded widely with eminent naturalists including Carl Linnaeus , Coenraad Jacob Temminck and Thomas Pennant to collect accurate information on the hundreds of species illustrated in the work . 
 The book is illustrated with over 500 drawings directly onto wood blocks , mostly by Alexander Fussell . These were then engraved by John Thompson . Publication was initially in 37 parts of three large folded sheets each ; these were then collected and bound into volumes . Most of the copies were on octavo paper ; some " large paper " format copies were printed in the larger royal octavo with just 50 copies in the very large imperial octavo format . Four editions were produced between 1843 and 1885 . 
 = = Approach = = 
 Yarrell was aware of earlier bird handbooks , especially Bewick 's . A History of British Birds used the same title as Bewick 's popular book ( 1797 – 1804 ) . Its approach , however , was significantly different in the <unk> of Yarrell 's correspondence and in the increased emphasis on scientific accuracy made possible by the rapid advance in ornithological knowledge in the nineteenth century . 
 = = = Correspondence and specimens = = = 
 Yarrell corresponded widely , consulted existing handbooks of birds , and made use of his membership of the Zoological Society of London and the Linnean Society to find out about recent discoveries . He referenced the work of , amongst others , the ornithologists William Macgillivray , John James Audubon , George Montagu , Prideaux John Selby , Leonard Jenyns , John Gould , Temminck , Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Heinrich von Kittlitz . During the six years of writing , with the regular publication of three @-@ sheet instalments of his Birds , many people across Britain and Europe sent him descriptions , observations and specimens for him to include , and the book is full of references to such contributions . Yarrell explicitly states in his Preface that 
 During these six years many occurrences of rare birds , and of some that were even new to Britain , became known to me , either by the communications of private friends and correspondents , or from the examination of the various periodical works which give publicity to such events . 
 In some cases , Yarrell 's correspondents and reference books enable him to add an account of a bird 's distribution around the world . For the ringed plover , for example , Sven Nilsson speaks for Sweden and the Baltic coast ; Mr Hewitson for Norway ; Carl Linnaeus for Lapland ; a Mr Scoresby for Iceland and Greenland ; the zoologist Thomas Pennant for Russia and Siberia ; the archaeologist Charles Fellows for Asia Minor [ Turkey ] , and Coenraad Jacob Temminck for Japan . In the case of the wood sandpiper , Dr. Calvert sent a specimen from Malta ; Selby and Dr. Andrew Smith , specimens from South Africa ; others from India ; Gould " mentions having seen skins " from " Chili and the Islands of the Pacific " . Yarrell also describes his own observations , in this case with the words " It [ the wood sandpiper ] is far from being numerous in the localities where I met with it ... Although I met with the young in a downy state , and partially feathered , I only obtained one nest with eggs . " 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 Yarrell broadly follows the lead of Bewick in describing each species in a separate section , with essentially no introduction . The first bird , the Egyptian vulture , is preceded by nothing more than the Index ( there is no table of contents ) and the heading " British Birds " , though there is an introductory paragraph on page 2 , inside the Egyptian vulture article . Like Bewick , Yarrell 's sections begin with a large wood engraving , depicting the species against a more or less realistic background : that of the Egyptian vulture shows a pyramid and a pair of laden camels . An immediate difference from Bewick is the list of Latin names that follows , with Vultur percnopterus ( Bewick ) , Neophron percnopterus ( Selby , Jenyns , Eyton , and Gould ) , and Cathartes percnopterus ( Temminck ) . This care reflects both the rapidly advancing state of ornithology in the early nineteenth century , and Yarrell 's more scientific approach . 
 The account of the first species of each genus , such as the Neophron genus of vultures , includes a paragraph on " Generic Characters " , describing the beak , legs , wings and any distinguishing features useful for identification . These features are often small , requiring examination or measurement of specimens in the hand , reflecting the fact , repeated many times in the book , that those interested in birds shot them to collect unusual specimens . The Egyptian vulture was recorded from a specimen in Somerset , England , " now in the possession of the Rev. A. Mathew , of Kilve in Somersetshire , [ which ] was shot near that place in October 1825 . " The bird was one of a pair , but the other was too wary to be captured . Yarrell then proceeds to describe where the bird can be found , its behaviour and diet , and its detailed appearance . The Egyptian vulture takes up six pages , which is typical ; the golden eagle gets eight pages , the hobby only four . 
 Also like Bewick , many articles end with a tail @-@ piece , a small engraving , but here again Yarrell shows himself to be both more serious and less merely decorative than Bewick , with more information to impart . The Egyptian vulture article ends with a large and accurate engraving of another specimen , so the article shows both a young and an old bird , with clearly different plumage which is also described in the text . 
 = = = Descriptions = = = 
 As well as straightforward details of each bird , Yarrell adds many stories , chosen from his own experience , from his correspondents , or from often recently published accounts , to enliven the description of each species according to his taste . 
 For example , the " Fulmar Petrel " quotes John Macgillivray 's article " in a recent number of the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal " , describing a visit to St Kilda in June 1840 , for a page and a half . It begins : 
 This bird exists here in almost incredible numbers , and to the natives is by far the most important of the productions of the island ... [ They ] daily risk their lives in its pursuit . The Fulmar breeds on the face of the highest precipices , and only on such as are furnished with small grassy shelves , every spot on which , above a few inches in extent , is occupied with one or more of its nests ... The young birds were very clamorous on being handled , and vomited a quantity of clear oil ... which imparts to the whole bird , its nest and young , and even to the rock which it frequents , a peculiar and very disagreeable odour . Fulmar oil is among the most valuable productions of St Kilda . The best is obtained from the old bird . The Fulmar flies with great buoyancy and considerable rapidity , and when at sea is generally seen skimming along the surface of the waves at a slight elevation ... 
 Macgillivray is similarly relied upon for accounts of the pink @-@ footed goose and the <unk> as far as the Hebrides are concerned . 
 As with Bewick , Yarrell is unsentimental about hunting . <unk> or <unk> " are considered most delicate as articles of food , and in such high estimation , that two <unk> are said to be a present for a queen . " But he constantly provides accurate stories that inform and entertain the reader : 
 Mr Jesse .. says : — A gentleman had a Corn Crake brought to him by his dog , to all appearance quite dead . As it lay on the ground , he turned it over with his foot , and was convinced it was dead . Standing by , however , in silence , he suddenly saw it open an eye . He then took it up ; its head fell ; its legs hung loose , and it appeared again quite dead . He then put it in his pocket , and before long he felt it all alive , and struggling to escape . He then took it out ; it was as lifeless as before . Having laid it again upon the ground and retired to some distance , the bird in about five minutes warily raised its head , looked round , and decamped at full speed . 
 = = Observations = = 
 In addition to the work of collating descriptions and commissioning drawings and engravings , Yarrell also made his own scientific observations of certain topics , including the description of the trachea of several species , and a detailed account , occupying seven pages , of the skull , jaw , musculature , and feeding behaviour of the common crossbill , Loxia <unk> . The article for the crossbill is one of the longest in the book , at 20 pages . Yarrell introduces his special interest in this bird 's head as follows : 
 The peculiar formation and direction of the parts of the beak in the <unk> , its anomalous appearance , as well as the particular and powerful manner in which it is exercised , had long excited in me a desire to examine the structure of an organ so curious , and the kindness of a friend supplied me with the means . 
 Yarrell at once goes on to explain that the crossbills are unique in making use of " any lateral motion of the mandibles , and it is my object here to describe the bony structure and muscles by which this peculiar and powerful action is obtained . " He explains the anatomy and how the jaws are closed , and then how their unique side @-@ to @-@ side motion is achieved : 
 When the lateral motion is required , the great pyramidal muscle on the right side pulls the extremity of the lower jaw , to which it is attached backwards ; the pterygoid muscle of the left side at the same time powerfully assisting by carrying that side of the lower jaw inwards . 
 He then quotes a Mr. <unk> 's account of how crossbills feed on pine cones , inserting their beaks between the scales and then forcing them sideways , opening the cone . Yarrell then immediately returns to anatomy , describing in detail ( nearly a page ) how the tongue is used to extract the seed from between the cone scales . Only then does he return to Mr. <unk> , quoting him as saying " The degree of the lateral power is surprising , and they are fond of exercising it for amusement ; they are , therefore , not a little mischievous . My pets would often come to my table whilst I was writing , and carry off my pencils ... and tear them to pieces in a minute . " Yarrell then adds an observation of his own , and contradicts an opinion of a famous scientist : " Notwithstanding Buffon 's assertion to the contrary , they can pick up and eat the smallest seeds ... so perfect and useful is this singular instrument . " He goes on to criticise Buffon 's description of the crossbill 's beak as " an error and defect of Nature , and a useless deformity " as " an erroneous and hasty conclusion " . Yarrell concludes by writing " I have never met with a more interesting , or more beautiful example , of the adaptation of means to an end , than is to be found in the beak , the tongue , and their muscles , in the <unk> " . 
 = = Illustrations = = 
 Alexander Fussell created most of the drawings for the book . Yarrell thanks Fussell in his Preface for " nearly five hundred of the drawings on wood here employed " , and John Thompson ( 1785 – 1866 ) and his sons for the " very long series of engravings " of the drawings . He also thanks his printers , Messrs. Bentley , Wilson and <unk> for their care and skill . The pen for the remaining drawings , if any ( the title page asserts there are 520 in the book ) , is not stated . As well as the figures of birds , there are 59 tail @-@ pieces ( following Bewick , small woodcuts to fill in the spaces at ends of articles ) , of which some are whimsical , like Bewick 's , but many illustrate anatomical details , especially breastbones and <unk> , and others , although decorative , realistically depict aspects of bird behaviour or human interaction with birds . For example , the tail @-@ piece for the " Jack Snipe " shows a bittern among reeds , swallowing a frog , while that for the " Common Bittern " shows " a mode of shooting an Eagle from a pit " . 
 Fussell 's work began in 1837 and continued for six years . Many of the drawings were from skins or stuffed specimens , though every bird species is illustrated with a lifelike drawing of the bird standing ( or rarely , flying or swimming ) in a natural setting . Additional drawings depict nests , feathers , and details of bird anatomy including feet , breastbones , and <unk> . Simon Holloway suggests that Fussell and the engravers Charles Thompson and sons probably made all the illustrations for the first three editions of Yarrell 's Birds . Only in the fourth , rewritten edition of 1871 – 85 were illustrations by other artists ( Charles Whymper , J. G. Keulemans , Edward Neale ) added . Some of the bird figures , such as " The Snowy Owl " and " Richard 's <unk> " in Volume 1 , are signed " A. <unk> DEL . " ( A. <unk> drew this ) , but most are entirely unsigned . Some few , such as " The Black <unk> " and " The Common Cuckoo " , are signed " <unk> DEL ET SC . " ( Thompson drew and cut this ) , so in these cases Fussell was not involved .

 Contemporaries enjoyed Yarrell 's Birds , which sold well through various editions . In The Birds of Shakespeare ( 1871 ) , James Edmund Harting notes that " an excellent dissertation on the organ of voice in the raven will be found in the second volume of Yarrell 's ' British Birds ' " , and Harting refers to Yarrell when he needs ornithological facts . 
 Thomas R Forbes , in his biographical paper on Yarrell , writes that " All [ editions of Birds ] are outstanding because of the author 's clear , narrative style , accuracy , careful scholarship , and unassuming charm . " 
 Simon Holloway , in his Historical Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland 1875 – 1900 , writes that Yarrell 's Birds was " far more thoroughly dealt with than in Bewick 's work and , once again , was liberally illustrated with wood @-@ engravings " . He adds that the book was " also hugely influential in its day " , being " reasonably cheap " , and that it was the book that the future authors of " the county <unk> were bought as children and remained their standard textbook " , i.e. that Yarrell influenced a whole generation of ornithological authors in Britain . Holloway used Yarrell 's figures to accompany the account of each species of bird in his Historical Atlas . 
 The Soffer Ornithology Collection at Amherst College observes that " Yarrell 's History was the standard illustrated British bird book of the 19th century and one of the historically great ornithological works . In well chosen prose , Yarrell provides synonymy , generic characters , a description with measurements , local and general distribution and a life history including <unk> and eggs and arrival and departure times for each species . The wood engraved text figures have never been surpassed using this technique in terms of accuracy and artistic merit . " Soffer suggests that the " fourth edition is perhaps the best , embellished as it is by contributions from Alfred Newton and Howard Saunders " . 
 In Ornithology in Scotland , Yarrell 's Birds is described as " written by an Englishman and illustrated in a manner calculated to attract the non @-@ scientific ornithologist right at the opening of the era of the great Victorian naturalists " . It eclipsed the unfortunate MacGillivray , whose British Birds in contrast " never achieved real popularity " , partly because it was illustrated strictly technically , and partly because it appeared at the same time as the first part of Yarrell 's work . 
 The bookseller <unk> Books argues that " Yarrell ’ s History [ of British Birds ] probably contains the richest collection of colour descriptions in any bird book in the English language " , with " various parts of the Bee @-@ Eater described as <unk> blue , saffron @-@ yellow , chestnut , duck @-@ green , verdigris @-@ green , buff , greyish @-@ brown and fawn colour . The Roller as <unk> @-@ blue , brownish @-@ yellow , coppery @-@ purple and light cinnamon . The Spotted Eagle as chocolate @-@ brown , pale wood @-@ brown and reddish liver @-@ brown . The Golden Oriole had lead @-@ colour toes , other parts oil @-@ green , <unk> @-@ brown and wine @-@ yellow . The <unk> @-@ Tailed Gull was smoke @-@ brown and pearl @-@ grey , the <unk> had <unk> portions , the Little Auk was livid @-@ brown and sooty @-@ brown , while the American Bittern was leaden @-@ brown . The variations in these terms seems to be <unk> . They can now be considered a <unk> [ sic ] , somewhat romantic or just pure pedantry on the author ’ s part . But it was a serious attempt to try to define quite subtle colourings . "

 Yarrell 's Birds was mentioned in a well @-@ known letter to The Times in 1913 , when a Fellow of the Royal Society , the naturalist and paleontologist Richard Lydekker , wrote on 6 February that he had heard a cuckoo , explaining that though contrary to Yarrell 's statement that records of the bird calling as early as March " must be treated with suspicion , if not with incredulity " , it was a definite fact . Six days later on 12 February 1913 , Lydekker wrote again , confessing that " the note was uttered by a bricklayer 's labourer " . Letters about the first cuckoo became a tradition in the newspaper . 
 = = Editions = = 
 Birds was first published " in thirty @-@ seven parts of three sheets each , at intervals of two months ; the first Part was issued in July 1837 , and the last in May 1843 . " The sheets were then collected into three volumes , with the addition of " many occurrences of rare birds , and of some that were even new to Britain " . The additional birds were listed and briefly described in the Preface , and " the new subjects have been engraved on single leaves , so paged , that the bookbinder may insert these separate leaves among the birds of the genus to which each respectively belongs . " 
 The book came out in three different formats . The smallest is " octavo " ; the two " large paper " formats are " royal octavo " and " imperial octavo " . A supplement appeared in 1845 ; it was bound into the third volume of the rare " imperial octavo " edition of 1845 , of which only 50 copies were printed . 
 The fourth edition was revised and extended by the ornithologists Alfred Newton and Howard Saunders , with some additional illustrations bringing the total number of engravings up to 564 .

 = Interstate 476 = 
 Interstate 476 ( I @-@ 476 ) is a 132 @.@ 1 @-@ mile ( 212 @.@ 59 km ) auxiliary Interstate Highway in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania designated between Interstate 95 near Chester and Interstate 81 near Scranton , serving as the primary north – south Interstate corridor through eastern Pennsylvania . It consists of both the 20 @-@ mile ( 32 @.@ 19 km ) Mid @-@ County Expressway , locally referred to as the " Blue Route " ( although no signs exist with that designation ) , through the suburban Philadelphia @-@ area counties of Delaware and Montgomery , and the 110 @.@ 6 @-@ mile ( 177 @.@ 99 km ) Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike connecting the Philadelphia metropolitan area with the Lehigh Valley , the Poconos , and the Wyoming Valley . The Blue Route passes through suburban areas , while the Northeast Extension predominantly runs through rural areas of mountains and farmland , with development closer to Philadelphia and in the Lehigh Valley and the Wyoming Valley . I @-@ 476 intersects many major roads including Interstate 76 ( the Schuylkill Expressway ) in West Conshohocken , Interstate 276 ( the Pennsylvania Turnpike ) in Plymouth Meeting , U.S. Route 22 near Allentown , and Interstate 80 near Hickory Run State Park . 
 While proposed as early as 1929 , the construction of the Mid @-@ County Expressway through did not begin until 1967 and was not completed until 1991 due to massive community and environmental opposition during the freeway revolts of the 1960s and 1970s , leading The Philadelphia Inquirer to dub it " the most costly , most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history . " In order to get the route through Delaware County , it was built with many environmental compromises such as a parkway design and four lanes south of the Pennsylvania Route 3 interchange . The Mid @-@ County Expressway received its " Blue Route " nickname from the chosen route through Delaware County on planning maps on which it was differentiated from the other proposed routes by its color . 
 Following the completion of the Mid @-@ County Expressway , in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include the entire length of the existing Northeast Extension , replacing PA 9 . The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border ; however , I @-@ 81 was built between these two points instead . Since the extension , I @-@ 476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States . In fact , it is longer than some mainline interstates such as Interstate 83 in Maryland and Pennsylvania , Interstate 99 in Pennsylvania , Interstate 12 in Louisiana , Interstate 19 in Arizona , Interstate 97 in Maryland , and Interstate 2 in Texas . Additionally , its numbering is unusual since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs . I @-@ 476 may be surpassed by Interstate 369 in Texas if I @-@ 369 is extended to the Gulf of Mexico .

 The portion of Interstate 476 between Interstate 95 and Interstate 276 runs north – south through Delaware and Montgomery Counties and is officially known as the Mid @-@ County Expressway and the Veterans Memorial Highway , as well as by the nickname the " Blue Route " . The road 's southern terminus is at a junction with Interstate 95 near Chester , a city southwest of Philadelphia , near Philadelphia International Airport . Heading north , the road immediately narrows to a four @-@ lane parkway north of Exit 1 , MacDade Boulevard . It winds through the western Philadelphia suburbs of Wallingford and Swarthmore , where I @-@ 476 comes to an interchange with Baltimore Pike . From here , the freeway continues north to Springfield , where it meets U.S. Route 1 at a three @-@ level diamond interchange . 
 Past US 1 , I @-@ 476 continues through wooded suburban areas and interchanges with Pennsylvania Route 3 in <unk> , where it widens to six lanes . The route continues to Radnor Township , on the Main Line , where it interchanges with U.S. Route 30 . Stone monuments , including a large stone cairn atop a hill and a large crushed @-@ stone image of a mythological griffin on a hillside , were constructed at the Route 30 interchange to commemorate Radnor 's history as part of the Welsh Tract . Proceeding northward , the route enters Montgomery County and comes to an interchange with Interstate 76 ( Schuylkill Expressway ) at West Conshohocken . After crossing the Schuylkill River on the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge , the freeway heads into Plymouth Township , where it interchanges with Ridge Pike and Germantown Pike before coming to the Mid @-@ County Interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting . The entire length of the Blue Route is designated the Blue Route Scenic Byway , a Pennsylvania Scenic Byway . 
 = = = Northeast Extension = = = 
 Beyond the Mid @-@ County Interchange , Interstate 476 enters the Pennsylvania Turnpike system , interchanging with Interstate 276 and continuing north as the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike . The route continues through the Philadelphia suburbs interchanging with Pennsylvania Route 63 near Lansdale . Past this interchange , the route enters a more rural setting of woods and farms , crossing into Bucks County and coming to an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 663 near Quakertown . The Northeast Extension continues into Lehigh County , part of the Lehigh Valley metropolitan area , past the PA 663 interchange . Here , it interchanges with U.S. 22 ( Lehigh Valley Thruway ) near Allentown , which offers an indirect connection to Pennsylvania Route 309 and Interstate 78 . 
 North of Allentown , the route runs through more farmland before passing under the Blue Mountain in the Lehigh Tunnel and entering Carbon County in the Poconos . Here , I @-@ 476 crosses over the Lehigh River and interchanges with U.S. 209 near <unk> . Continuing through mountainous areas , it has an E @-@ ZPass @-@ only exit for Pennsylvania Route 903 and cuts through Hickory Run State Park before interchanging with Interstate 80 and Pennsylvania Route 940 just to the north of the state park . The route continues through mountainous terrain , heading into Luzerne County and coming to an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 115 in Bear Creek that provides access to nearby Wilkes @-@ Barre . The route comes to a toll barrier near Pittston that marks the northern end of the toll ticket system in the Northeast Extension . A short distance later , an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 315 provides indirect access to Interstate 81 and Scranton . Past this interchange , I @-@ 476 enters Lackawanna County and crosses built @-@ up areas of the Wyoming Valley as it skirts around Scranton , with a mainline toll plaza and an exit to Keyser Avenue . North of Scranton in Clarks Summit , the route comes to a hairpin curve and ends at an interchange with connections to Interstate 81 , U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 11 . US 6 joins the turnpike for less than a quarter mile to connect between I @-@ 81 and US 11 . As this is north of the Clarks Summit toll plaza , no toll is collected on this short segment . 
 = = Tolls = = 
 The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike uses the ticket system method of tolling between the Mid @-@ County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas along with the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike . With the ticket system , a motorist receives a ticket upon entering the turnpike at an interchange and pays the fare and surrenders the ticket upon exiting . If a motorist loses the ticket , the turnpike charges the highest fare to the exit where the motorist leaves . Mainline toll plazas are also located at Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit , charging a flat rate . There are no tolls on exit ramps between Wyoming Valley and Clarks Summit . E @-@ ZPass is accepted at all toll plazas . As of 2016 , it costs a passenger vehicle $ 11 @.@ 40 to travel the length of the Northeast Extension between Mid @-@ County and Wyoming Valley using cash and $ 8 @.@ 06 using E @-@ ZPass . The Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas cost $ 1 @.@ 35 using cash and $ 0 @.@ 76 using E @-@ ZPass for passenger vehicles . 
 The tickets along the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike were originally handed out by person . In 1987 , machines started to replace humans in distributing tickets . In 1990 , an electronic toll collection system was proposed for the Pennsylvania Turnpike , where a motorist would create an account and use an electronic device that would be read from an electronic tollbooth . The motorist would be billed later . The multi @-@ state electronic tolling system , which was to be called E @-@ ZPass , was planned to be implemented by 1998 . The planned installation date was later pushed back to 2000 . On December 2 , 2000 , E @-@ ZPass debuted along the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Mid @-@ County and Lehigh Valley . On December 15 , 2001 , E @-@ ZPass was extended to include the entire length of the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike . Commercial vehicles were allowed to start using E @-@ ZPass on December 14 , 2002 . 
 On November 24 , 2004 , the day before Thanksgiving , 2 @,@ 000 Teamsters Union employees went on strike , after contract negotiations failed . This was the first strike in the history of the roadway . As this is usually one of the busiest traffic days in the United States , to avoid traffic jams , tolls were waived for the rest of the day . Starting on November 25 , turnpike management personnel collected flat @-@ rate passenger tolls of $ 2 and commercial tolls of $ 15 from cash customers on the ticketed system , while E @-@ ZPass customers were charged the lesser of the actual toll or the same flat rates . The strike ended after seven days when both sides reached an agreement on November 30 . Normal toll collection resumed December 1 . 
 The turnpike commission announced plans to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all @-@ electronic tolls . With this , tolls will be paid using either E @-@ ZPass or credit cards . Drivers unable to pay by either of these methods will be billed in the mail using license plate recognition ; an additional surcharge will be applied . In addition to E @-@ ZPass , the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition . McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates have been hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all @-@ electronic tolls . 
 On March 6 , 2012 , the turnpike commission announced that it was going forward with an all @-@ electronic tolling plan . Such a plan will take at least five years to implement to allow time for equipment to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps . It will save the turnpike commission $ 65 million a year on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors . The plans call for a 76 % surcharge for motorists who do not have E @-@ ZPass that are billed by mail . This surcharge could raise the toll for someone without E @-@ ZPass to $ 53 @.@ 10 to travel the entire turnpike .

 The Northeast Extension has a <unk> every mile for its entire length . Motorists may also dial * 11 on their mobile phones . First responder services are available to all turnpike customers via the State Farm Safety Patrol program . The safety patrol program , which is free , looks for disabled motorists , debris , and accidents along the roadway and provides assistance . The patrol service is available 24 hours every day of the year . Each patrol vehicle covers a 20 @-@ to @-@ 25 @-@ mile ( 32 to 40 km ) stretch of the turnpike . Towing services are available from authorized service garages located near the highway . Pennsylvania State Police Troop T patrols the Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension . It has headquarters in Highspire and a substation at Pocono . 
 The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission broadcasts current roadway , traffic , and weather conditions via " Highway Advisory Radio " transmitters at each exit . Broadcasts are available on AM 1640 and can be received approximately two miles away from each exit . Motorists can also receive alerts and information via the internet , mobile phone , a hotline , and message boards at service plazas through the Turnpike Roadway Information Program ( TRIP ) . 
 = = = Service plazas = = = 
 The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike has 2 service plazas . The service plazas offer various fast food restaurants such as Burger King , Roy Rogers , Famous Famiglia Pizzeria , Auntie Anne 's , Hershey 's Ice Cream , and Starbucks , and a gift shop . Each service plaza also has a Sunoco gas station and an A @-@ Plus convenience store . Other amenities are available such as an ATM , pay phone , picnic areas , restrooms , tourist information , and Wi @-@ Fi . The Allentown plaza contains a seasonal farmers market . 
 In 2006 , HMSHost was awarded a contract to reconstruct the service plazas along the turnpike . The reconstruction of the service plazas , which is to cost $ 150 million , will include a food court layout and modernized restrooms . Sunoco will continue to operate the gas stations at the renovated service plazas . The Allentown service plaza was rebuilt between September 2007 and May 2008 while the Hickory Run service plaza was rebuilt between January 2009 and November 2010 .

 Originally planned as far back as 1929 , the Mid @-@ County Expressway was later proposed by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission as the " Chester Extension " of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1954 . After the advent of the Interstate Highway System , the project was transferred to the Pennsylvania Department of Highways to be built as part of the system , designating it first as Interstate 495 , and later as Interstate 480 , as I @-@ 76 was designated as I @-@ 80S at the time . The present @-@ day I @-@ 476 designation was assigned on February 6 , 1964 when I @-@ 80S was renumbered as I @-@ 76 . 
 The road received its nickname from a 1958 location report indicating various proposed geographic configurations of an expressway through Delaware County with lines of various colors on a map . The " blue route " through the Crum Creek valley won out over other contenders , which included a more easterly " red route " and " yellow route " and a more westerly " green route " . 
 As one of the most controversial Interstate Highways in Pennsylvania , construction of I @-@ 476 began in 1967 , but was not completed until 1991 between MacDade Boulevard ( Exit 1 ) and Interstate 76 ( Exit 16 ) , and until 1992 between Germantown Pike east / Chemical Road ( Exit 19 ) and Interstate 276 / Pennsylvania Turnpike ( Exit 20 ) , due to litigation between the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and several communities in the road 's path over environmental concerns . However , the section of Interstate 476 ( south end of I @-@ 476 ) between I @-@ 95 and MacDade Blvd . ( Exit 1 ) was opened in 1987 , but signage labeled it as a route " To MacDade Blvd " until 1991 when I @-@ 476 / The Blue Route was opened between Exits 1 and 16 , and connected with the short existing section of roadway dating back to 1979 from Exit 16 @-@ Exit 19 . 
 An agreement in 1985 led to many environmental compromises in the road 's design , including a downsized four @-@ lane design south of Pennsylvania Route 3 , ramp meters , and federal scenic route status , prohibiting the erection of advertisement billboards along the entire freeway portion . While the redesigned highway was largely well @-@ received , the constriction to four lanes has led to bottleneck conditions in the area , and many communities that originally opposed the road have now called for its widening . The Philadelphia Inquirer dubbed I @-@ 476 " the most costly , most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history " due to the decades of opposition it garnered . 
 The road is currently undergoing a complete rehabilitation project , including paving , bridge repair , and ramp maintenance of the entire length of the freeway between Interstate 95 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike . 
 The section between I @-@ 95 and I @-@ 76 was completed in 2007 and the section between I @-@ 76 and I @-@ 276 was completed in the end of 2011 . 
 = = = Northeast Extension history = = = 
 In 1953 , an extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike from the mainline near Philadelphia north through Northeastern Pennsylvania to the New York border near Binghamton was proposed . Groundbreaking for the Northeastern Extension occurred on March 25 , 1954 in White Haven , with Governor John S. Fine and commission chairman Thomas J. Evans present . The Northeast Extension was planned to run from the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting north to a temporary terminus at Scranton . In April 1954 , $ 233 million in bonds were issued to build the Northeastern Extension along with the Delaware River Bridge on the mainline Pennsylvania Turnpike . The Northeast Extension was built with a 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) median in order to save money . Due to the mountainous terrain it passed through , a large amount of earthwork was necessary to build the road along with the construction of large bridges . Among the bridges built was the 1 @,@ 632 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 497 m ) Clark 's Summit Bridge over US 6 / US 11 , which was the tallest bridge on the Pennsylvania Turnpike system at 135 feet ( 41 m ) . The Northeast Extension also included the two @-@ lane Lehigh Tunnel through Blue Mountain . The tunnel was originally going to be named for commission chairman Evans , but was changed when he was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the commission of $ 19 million ( equal to $ 134 @,@ 839 @,@ 321 today ) . 
 The roadway opened between Plymouth Meeting and the Lehigh Valley interchange near Allentown on November 23 , 1955 . The highway was extended north to Emerald on December 28 , 1955 . The Northeast Extension was opened between Emerald and Wyoming Valley on April 1 , 1957 . The entire length of the Northeast Extension was finished on November 7 , 1957 with the completion of the northernmost part between Wyoming Valley and Scranton . The part of the Northeast Extension between Scranton and the New York border would not be built as part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike system but rather the Interstate Highway System as I @-@ 81 . At the northern terminus , the Northeast Extension narrowed to two lanes along the northbound off @-@ ramp at Scranton to come to its northern terminus , with an abandoned short spur of the mainline heading north . A pair of trumpet interchanges were built to connect the Northeast Extension and I @-@ 81 . In 1980 , the roadway would be designated PA 9 . 
 When it first opened , traffic on the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike was light . By the 1970s , traffic along the roadway would increase with the completion of the connecting I @-@ 80 and the rising popularity of the Poconos as a vacation destination . As a result , the two @-@ lane Lehigh Tunnel faced serious congestion . Plans were made to either bypass the tunnel or add a second tube . The turnpike commission decided it would build a second tunnel as the cost was lower than building a bypass . In 1988 , a $ 37 million contract was awarded to build the second tube . Groundbreaking for the tunnel took place on February 14 , 1989 , with Governor Robert P. Casey in attendance . Excavation of the new tunnel began in July of that year . Construction of the second tube utilized the New Austrian Tunnelling method , which reduced the cost of the tunnel by $ 5 to $ 6 million . It was the first tunnel in the United States to use this construction method . The second tube at Lehigh Tunnel opened on November 22 , 1991 , with Governor Casey in attendance leading a line of antique cars . Construction of the tunnel cost $ 45 million . The new tube is used for southbound traffic while the original tube carries northbound traffic . The newer tunnel is wider , higher , and brighter than the original . 
 On February 1 , 1995 , the Keyser Avenue interchange near Scranton was slated to open at a cost of $ 22 @.@ 4 million . Construction of this interchange also involved constructing a new mainline flat @-@ rate toll barrier near the new interchange . 
 On November 1 , 1996 , the Northeast Extension was added to the Interstate Highway System as an extension of I @-@ 476 , replacing the PA 9 designation along the road . The addition of the second tube at the Lehigh Tunnel along with new guardrails and line striping was necessary for the toll road to become an Interstate . It was hoped that the Interstate designation would bring economic development and tourism to the areas served by the roadway . This extension resulted in I @-@ 476 surpassing the 120 @-@ mile ( 190 km ) I @-@ 495 in Massachusetts as the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway . 
 In 2007 , the turnpike commission announced plans to widen the Northeast Extension to six lanes between Mid @-@ County and Lansdale . In January 2008 , work began on the replacement of two bridges over the Northeast Extension to accommodate the widened highway . The widening was originally expected to be complete in 2013 ; however , construction fell a year behind schedule . Construction on the southern section of the widening project between Mid @-@ County and Lansdale began in January 2011 was finished in October 2014 while work on the northern portion started in May 2014 and will be finished by the end of 2016 . Following the completion of widening this section , the portion of the roadway from Lansdale to Quakertown will be widened to six lanes . In spring 2013 , replacement of bridges began between mileposts 31 and 38 , with work on the actual widening to begin in fall 2016 . 
 In 1990 , plans were made to build an interchange at PA 903 in Carbon County . A bill authorizing construction of this interchange was signed into law by Governor Casey in July of that year . Plans for this interchange were cancelled by the turnpike commission in 1995 . In 2006 , plans for an interchange at PA 903 were resurrected , with the proposed interchange to be all @-@ electronic , in that it will only accept E @-@ ZPass . Construction on the $ 23 million interchange began in the middle of 2008 . The interchange opened to traffic on June 30 , 2015 . 
 On April 28 , 2016 , plans were announced for a " Scranton Beltway " to use I @-@ 476 as a bypass for I @-@ 81 around the heavily congested segment through Scranton and its suburbs . The turnpike between the two I @-@ 81 interchanges carries an average of 10 @,@ 000 vehicles per day vs. 70 @,@ 000 on the parallel segment of I @-@ 81 . This project will build two high @-@ speed connections between I @-@ 476 and I @-@ 81 : one south of Scranton in Dupont and one north of Scranton in South Abington Township . Tolls on the connections will be paid with E @-@ ZPass or toll @-@ by @-@ plate . Construction on this project , which is expected to cost $ 160 million , could begin as soon as 2021 .

Aspirin is also used long @-@ term , at low doses , to help prevent heart attacks , strokes , and blood clot formation in people at high risk of developing blood clots . Low doses of aspirin may be given immediately after a heart attack to prevent clotting and reduce the risk of another heart attack or the death of heart tissue . Aspirin may be effective at preventing certain types of cancer , particularly colorectal cancer . 
 The main side effects of aspirin are gastric ulcers , stomach bleeding , and ringing in the ears , especially with higher doses . While daily aspirin can help prevent a clot @-@ related stroke , it may increase risk of a bleeding stroke ( hemorrhagic stroke ) . In children and adolescents , aspirin is not recommended for flu @-@ like symptoms or viral illnesses , because of the risk of Reye 's syndrome . 
 Aspirin is part of a group of medications called nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , but differs from most other NSAIDs in the mechanism of action . The salicylates have similar effects ( antipyretic , anti @-@ inflammatory , analgesic ) to the other NSAIDs and inhibit the same enzyme cyclooxygenase ( COX ) , but aspirin does so in an irreversible manner and , unlike others , affects the COX @-@ 1 variant more than the COX @-@ 2 variant of the enzyme . Aspirin also has an antiplatelet effect by stopping the binding together of platelets . 
 The therapeutic properties of willow tree bark have been known for at least 2 @,@ 400 years , with Hippocrates prescribing it for headaches . Salicylic acid , the active ingredient of aspirin , was first isolated from the bark of the willow tree in 1763 by Edward Stone of Wadham College , University of Oxford . Felix Hoffmann , a chemist at Bayer , is credited with the synthesis of aspirin in 1897 , though whether this was of his own initiative or under the direction of Arthur Eichengrün is controversial . Aspirin is one of the most widely used medications in the world with an estimated 40 @,@ 000 tonnes of it being consumed each year . In countries where " Aspirin " is a registered trademark owned by Bayer , the generic term is acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) . It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines , the most important medications needed in a basic health system . As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is less than US $ 25 . 
 = = Medical use = = 
 Aspirin is used in the treatment of a number of conditions , including fever , pain , rheumatic fever , and inflammatory diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis , pericarditis , and Kawasaki disease . Lower doses of aspirin have also shown to reduce the risk of death from a heart attack , or the risk of stroke in some circumstances . There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer , though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear . 
 = = = Pain = = = 
 Aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain , but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin is more likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding . Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps , bloating , gastric distension , or acute skin irritation . As with other NSAIDs , combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone . <unk> formulations of aspirin , such as Alka @-@ Seltzer or Blowfish , relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets , which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines . Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain . 
 = = = = Headache = = = = 
 Aspirin , either by itself or in a combined formulation , effectively treats certain types of a headache , but its efficacy may be questionable for others . Secondary headaches , meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma , should be promptly treated by a medical provider . 
 Among primary headaches , the International Classification of Headache Disorders distinguishes between tension headache ( the most common ) , migraine , and cluster headache . Aspirin or other over @-@ the @-@ counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headache . 
 Aspirin , especially as a component of an acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine , is considered a first @-@ line therapy in the treatment of migraine , and comparable to lower doses of sumatriptan . It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning . 
 = = = Fever = = = 
 Like its ability to control pain , aspirin 's ability to control fever is due to its action on the prostaglandin system through its irreversible inhibition of COX . Although aspirin 's use as an antipyretic in adults is well @-@ established , many medical societies and regulatory agencies ( including the American Academy of Family Physicians , the American Academy of Pediatrics , and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) ) strongly advise against using aspirin for treatment of fever in children because of the risk of Reye 's syndrome , a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection . Because of the risk of Reye 's syndrome in children , in 1986 , the FDA required labeling on all aspirin @-@ containing medications advising against its use in children and teenagers . 
 = = = Inflammation = = = 
 Aspirin is used as an anti @-@ inflammatory agent for both acute and long @-@ term inflammation , as well as for treatment of inflammatory diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis . 
 = = = Heart attacks and strokes = = = 
 Aspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) . One trial found that among those likely having a ST @-@ segment elevation MI , aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30 @-@ day death rate from 11 @.@ 8 % to 9 @.@ 4 % . There was no difference in major bleeding , but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin . 
 = = = = High risk = = = = 
 For people who have already had a heart attack or stroke , taking aspirin daily for two years prevented 1 in 50 from having a cardiovascular problem ( heart attack , stroke , or death ) , but also caused non @-@ fatal bleeding problems to occur in 1 of 400 people . 
 = = = = Lower risk = = = = 
 Studies have not found an overall benefit in the general population of healthy people , although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk , despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past . One study found that among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke , taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1 @,@ 667 from having a non @-@ fatal heart attack or stroke , but caused 1 in 3 @,@ 333 to have a non @-@ fatal bleeding event . However , the people looked at were at relatively higher risk than most people who have never had a heart attack or stroke . 
 Aspirin appears to offer little benefit to those at lower risk of heart attack or stroke — for instance , those without a history of these events or with pre @-@ existing disease . Some studies recommend aspirin on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis , while others have suggested the risks of other events , such as gastrointestinal bleeding , were enough to outweigh any potential benefit , and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely . Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a <unk> for prevention of cardiovascular disease . 
 Complicating the use of aspirin for prevention is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance . For people who are resistant , aspirin 's efficacy is reduced . Some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to aspirin . 
 = = = = After surgery = = = = 
 After percutaneous coronary interventions ( <unk> ) , such as the placement of a coronary artery stent , a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely . Frequently , aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor , such as clopidogrel , <unk> , or <unk> to prevent blood clots . This is called dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) . United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long , and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery . U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months , while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6 – 12 months after a drug @-@ <unk> stent placement . However , they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete . 
 = = = Cancer prevention = = = 
 Aspirin is thought to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer . This effect is particularly beneficial for colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . It may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer , breast cancer , and prostate cancer . 
 Some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk . Other are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk . Given this uncertainty , the 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of CRC in people with average risk . 
 = = = Other uses = = = 
 Aspirin is a first @-@ line treatment for the fever and joint @-@ pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever . The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks , and is rarely indicated for longer periods . After fever and pain have subsided , the aspirin is no longer necessary , since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease . <unk> has been shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic , but due to the limited clinical experience , naproxen is recommended only as a second @-@ line treatment . 
 Along with rheumatic fever , Kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children in spite of a lack of high quality evidence for its effectiveness . 
 Low @-@ dose aspirin supplementation has moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre @-@ eclampsia . 
 = = = Resistance = = = 
 For some people , aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others , an effect known as aspirin resistance or insensitivity . One study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men , and a different , aggregate study of 2 @,@ 930 patients found 28 % were resistant . A study in 100 Italian patients , though , found , of the apparent 31 % aspirin @-@ resistant subjects , only 5 % were truly resistant , and the others were noncompliant . Another study of 400 healthy volunteers found no subjects who were truly resistant , but some had " <unk> , reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption " . 
 = = = Dosage = = = 
 Adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes , which vary slightly from country to country , for example 300 mg in Britain and 325 mg ( or 5 grains ) in the United States . Smaller doses are based on these standards , e.g. , 75 mg and 81 mg tablets . The 81 mg ( 11 ⁄ 4 @-@ grain ) tablets are commonly called " baby aspirin " or " baby @-@ strength " , because they were originally — but no longer — intended to be administered to infants and children . No medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the 75 mg and the 81 mg tablets . 
 In general , for adults , doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis , with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever . For the prevention of myocardial infarction ( MI ) in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease , much lower doses are taken once daily . 
 Recommendations from the USPSTF on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45 – 79 and women aged 55 – 79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage . The <unk> study said regular low dose ( 75 or 81 mg ) aspirin female users had a 25 % lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14 % lower risk of death from any cause . Low @-@ dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events , and lower aspirin doses ( 75 or 81 mg / day ) may optimize efficacy and safety for patients requiring aspirin for long @-@ term prevention . 
 In children with Kawasaki disease , aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight , initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks . 
 = = Adverse effects = = 
 = = = Contraindications = = = 
 Aspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen , or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs , and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID @-@ precipitated bronchospasm . Owing to its effect on the stomach lining , manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers , mild diabetes , or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin . Even if none of these conditions is present , the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin . Patients with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates . Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose @-@ 6 @-@ phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency , particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease . Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency . People with kidney disease , hyperuricemia , or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys ' ability to excrete uric acid , thus may exacerbate these conditions . Aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms , as this has been linked with Reye 's syndrome . 
 = = = Gastrointestinal = = = 
 Aspirin use has been shown to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding . Although some enteric @-@ coated formulations of aspirin are advertised as being " gentle to the stomach " , in one study , enteric coating did not seem to reduce this risk . Combining aspirin with other NSAIDs has also been shown to further increase this risk . Using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding . 
 Blockade of COX @-@ 1 by aspirin apparently results in the upregulation of COX @-@ 2 as part of a gastric defense and that taking COX @-@ 2 inhibitors concurrently with aspirin increases the gastric mucosal erosion . Therefore , caution should be exercised if combining aspirin with any " natural " supplements with COX @-@ 2 @-@ inhibiting properties , such as garlic extracts , curcumin , bilberry , pine bark , ginkgo , fish oil , resveratrol , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and others . 
 In addition to enteric coating , " buffering " is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding . <unk> agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach , although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed . Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used ; <unk> , for example , uses magnesium oxide . Other preparations use calcium carbonate . 
 Taking it with vitamin C is a more recently investigated method of protecting the stomach lining . Taking equal doses of vitamin C and aspirin may decrease the amount of stomach damage that occurs compared to taking aspirin alone . 
 = = = Central effects = = = 
 Large doses of salicylate , a metabolite of aspirin , cause temporary tinnitus ( ringing in the ears ) based on experiments in rats , via the action on arachidonic acid and NMDA receptors cascade . 
 = = = Reye 's syndrome = = = 
 Reye 's syndrome , a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver , can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illnesses or infections . From 1981 through 1997 , 1207 cases of Reye 's syndrome in under @-@ 18 patients were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Of these , 93 % reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye 's syndrome , most commonly with a respiratory infection , chickenpox , or diarrhea . <unk> were detectable in 81 @.@ 9 % of children for whom test results were reported . After the association between Reye 's syndrome and aspirin was reported , and safety measures to prevent it ( including a Surgeon General 's warning , and changes to the labeling of aspirin @-@ containing drugs ) were implemented , aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States , as did the number of reported cases of Reye 's syndrome ; a similar decline was found in the United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now recommends aspirin ( or aspirin @-@ containing products ) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever , and the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin , unless it is on the advice of a doctor . 
 = = = Skin = = = 
 For a small number of people , taking aspirin can result in symptoms resembling an allergic reaction , including hives , swelling , and headache . The reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy , but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin , resulting in an overdose . 
 Aspirin and other NSAIDs , such as ibuprofen , may delay the healing of skin wounds . Aspirin may however help heal venous leg ulcers that have not healed following usual treatment . 
 = = = Other adverse effects = = = 
 Aspirin can induce swelling of skin tissues in some people . In one study , angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the patients . However , when the aspirin was taken alone , it did not cause angioedema in these patients ; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID @-@ induced drug when angioedema appeared . 
 Aspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral <unk> having the appearance on MRI scans of 5 to 10 mm or smaller , <unk> ( dark holes ) patches . Such cerebral <unk> are important , since they often occur prior to ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage , Binswanger disease , and Alzheimer 's disease . 
 A study of a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270 mg per day estimated an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) of 12 events per 10 @,@ 000 persons . In comparison , the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10 @,@ 000 persons , and a reduction of 39 events per 10 @,@ 000 persons in ischemic stroke . In cases where ICH already has occurred , aspirin use results in higher mortality , with a dose of about 250 mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ICH around 2 @.@ 5 ( 95 % confidence interval 1 @.@ 3 to 4 @.@ 6 ) . 
 Aspirin and other NSAIDs can cause abnormally high blood levels of potassium by inducing a <unk> <unk> state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis ; however , these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and <unk> state . 
 Aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days . In one study , 30 of <unk> elective surgical patients required <unk> to control bleeding . Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site . Diffuse , but not discrete , bleeding was associated with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding patients . 
 On 9 July 2015 , the FDA toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) . Aspirin is an NSAID but is not affected by the new warnings . 
 = = = Overdose = = = 
 Aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic . In acute poisoning , a single large dose is taken ; in chronic poisoning , higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time . Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2 % . Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal , with a mortality rate of 25 % ; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children . Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments , including activated charcoal , intravenous dextrose and normal saline , sodium bicarbonate , and dialysis . The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate , the active metabolite of aspirin , by automated spectrophotometric methods . Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30 – 100 mg / l after usual therapeutic doses , 50 – 300 mg / l in patients taking high doses and 700 – 1400 mg / l following acute overdose . <unk> is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate , methyl salicylate , and sodium salicylate . 
 = = = Interactions = = = 
 Aspirin is known to interact with other drugs . For example , acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates , and alcohol , and also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs . Aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein @-@ binding sites in the blood , including the antidiabetic drugs <unk> and <unk> , warfarin , methotrexate , phenytoin , probenecid , valproic acid ( as well as interfering with beta oxidation , an important part of valproate metabolism ) , and other NSAIDs . Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin . Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for <unk> and stroke prevention . The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin , and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion . Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C. 
 = = Chemical properties = = 
 Aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of ammonium acetate or of the acetates , carbonates , <unk> , or hydroxides of the alkali metals . It is stable in dry air , but gradually hydrolyses in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic acids . In solution with alkalis , the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate . 
 Like flour mills , factories that make aspirin tablets must pay attention to how much of the powder gets into the air inside the building , because the powder @-@ air mixture can be explosive . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) has set a recommended exposure limit in the United States of 5 mg / m3 ( time @-@ weighted average ) . In 1989 , OSHA set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of 5 mg / m3 , but this was vacated by the AFL @-@ CIO v. OSHA decision in 1993 . 
 = = Physical properties = = 
 Aspirin , an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid , is a white , crystalline , weakly acidic substance , with a melting point of 136 ° C ( 277 ° F ) , and a boiling point of 140 ° C ( 284 ° F ) . Its acid dissociation constant ( pKa ) is 3 @.@ 5 at 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) . 
 = = = Synthesis = = = 
 The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction . Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride , an acid derivative , causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid 's hydroxyl group into an ester group ( R @-@ OH → R @-@ <unk> ) . This process yields aspirin and acetic acid , which is considered a byproduct of this reaction . Small amounts of sulfuric acid ( and occasionally phosphoric acid ) are almost always used as a catalyst . This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs . 
 Reaction mechanism 
 Formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like vinegar because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions , yielding salicylic and acetic acids . 
 = = = Polymorphism = = = 
 Polymorphism , or the ability of a substance to form more than one crystal structure , is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients . Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph . For a long time , only one crystal structure for aspirin was known . That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s . The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by <unk> and coworkers in 2005 , and fine structural details were given by Bond et al . A new crystal type was found after attempted <unk> of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile . The form II is only stable at 100 K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature . In the ( unambiguous ) form I , two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the ( acidic ) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds , and in the newly claimed form II , each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one . With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups , both polymorphs form identical dimer structures . 
 = = Mechanism of action = = 
 = = = Discovery of the mechanism = = = 
 In 1971 , British pharmacologist John Robert Vane , then employed by the Royal College of Surgeons in London , showed aspirin suppressed the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes . For this discovery he was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , jointly with Sune K. Bergström and Bengt I. Samuelsson . In 1984 , he was made a Knight Bachelor . 
 = = = Suppression of prostaglandins and thromboxanes = = = 
 Aspirin 's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase ( COX ; officially known as prostaglandin @-@ <unk> synthase , PTGS ) enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis . Aspirin acts as an <unk> agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme . This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs ( such as diclofenac and ibuprofen ) , which are reversible inhibitors . 
 Low @-@ dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets , producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet ( 8 – 9 days ) . This <unk> property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks . 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely , with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected ; however , higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition . 
 <unk> , local hormones produced in the body , have diverse effects , including the transmission of pain information to the brain , modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat , and inflammation . <unk> are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots . Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots , and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction . 
 = = = COX @-@ 1 and COX @-@ 2 inhibition = = = 
 At least two different types of cyclooxygenase occur COX @-@ 1 and COX @-@ 2 . Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX @-@ 1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX @-@ 2 . COX @-@ 2 normally produces <unk> , most of which are proinflammatory . Aspirin @-@ modified PTGS2 produces <unk> , most of which are anti @-@ inflammatory . Newer NSAID drugs , COX @-@ 2 inhibitors ( <unk> ) , have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2 , with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects . 
 However , several of the new COX @-@ 2 inhibitors , such as <unk> ( Vioxx ) , have been withdrawn in the last decade , after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke . <unk> cells lining the <unk> in the body are proposed to express PTGS2 , and , by selectively inhibiting PTGS2 , prostaglandin production ( specifically , <unk> ; <unk> ) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels , as <unk> in platelets is unaffected . Thus , the protective anticoagulative effect of <unk> is removed , increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems . Since platelets have no DNA , they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme , an important difference with reversible inhibitors . 
 Furthermore , aspirin , while inhibiting the ability of COX @-@ 2 to form pro @-@ inflammatory products such as the prostaglandins , converts this enzyme 's activity from a prostaglandin @-@ forming cyclooxygenase to a lipoxygenase @-@ like enzyme : aspirin @-@ treated COX @-@ 2 metabolizes a variety polyunsaturated fatty acids to <unk> products which are then further metabolized to specialized <unk> mediators such as the aspirin @-@ triggered <unk> , aspirin @-@ triggered <unk> , and aspirin @-@ triggered <unk> . These mediators possess potent anti @-@ inflammatory activity . It is proposed that this aspirin @-@ triggered transition of COX @-@ 2 from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized <unk> mediators contributes to the anti @-@ inflammatory effects of aspirin . 
 = = = Additional mechanisms = = = 
 Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action . It <unk> oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous ( and hepatic ) mitochondria , by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix , where it ionizes once again to release protons . In short , aspirin buffers and transports the protons . When high doses of aspirin are given , it may actually cause fever , owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain , as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses . In addition , aspirin induces the formation of NO @-@ radicals in the body , which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation . This reduced leukocyte adhesion , which is an important step in immune response to infection ; however , evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection . More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF @-@ κB . NF @-@ κB , a transcription factor complex , plays a central role in many biological processes , including inflammation . 
 Aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid , which itself has anti @-@ inflammatory , antipyretic , and analgesic effects . In 2012 , salicylic acid was found to activate AMP @-@ activated protein kinase , which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin . The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets . <unk> of cellular proteins is a well @-@ established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post @-@ translational level . Aspirin is able to <unk> several other targets in addition to COX <unk> . These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin . 
 = = Pharmacokinetics = = 
 <unk> acid is a weak acid , and very little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration . <unk> acid is quickly absorbed through cell membrane in the acidic conditions of the stomach . The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there , as more of it is ionised . Owing to the formation of concretions , aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose , and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion . 
 About 50 – 80 % of salicylate in the blood is bound to albumin protein , while the rest remains in the active , ionized state ; protein binding is concentration @-@ dependent . Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity . The volume of distribution is 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 2 l / kg . Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates . 
 As much as 80 % of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver . Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid , and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters . The conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the acyl glucuronide ; the <unk> conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide . These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity . Small amounts of salicylic acid are also <unk> to gentisic acid . With large salicylate doses , the kinetics switch from first @-@ order to zero @-@ order , as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important . 
 <unk> are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid ( 75 % ) , free salicylic acid ( 10 % ) , salicylic phenol ( 10 % ) , and acyl <unk> ( 5 % ) , gentisic acid ( < 1 % ) , and 2 @,@ 3 @-@ <unk> acid . When small doses ( less than 250 mg in an adult ) are ingested , all pathways proceed by first @-@ order kinetics , with an elimination half @-@ life of about 2 @.@ 0 to 4 @.@ 5 hours . When higher doses of salicylate are ingested ( more than 4 g ) , the half @-@ life becomes much longer ( 15 – 30 hours ) , because the <unk> pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and <unk> phenolic glucuronide become saturated . Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated , because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH . A 10- to 20 @-@ fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8 . The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination . 
 = = History = = 
 Plant extracts , including willow bark and <unk> , of which salicylic acid was the active constituent , had been known to help alleviate headaches , pains , and fevers since antiquity . The father of modern medicine , Hippocrates ( circa 460 – 377 BC ) , left historical records describing the use of powder made from the bark and leaves of the willow tree to help these symptoms . 
 In 1763 , Edward Stone , at Oxford , isolated the active ingredient of aspirin in his discovery of salicylic acid . A French chemist , Charles Frederic Gerhardt , was the first to prepare acetylsalicylic acid in 1853 . In the course of his work on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides , he mixed acetyl chloride with a sodium salt of salicylic acid ( sodium salicylate ) . A vigorous reaction ensued , and the resulting melt soon solidified . Since no structural theory existed at that time , Gerhardt called the compound he obtained " salicylic @-@ acetic anhydride " ( <unk> Salicylsäure @-@ <unk> ) . This preparation of aspirin ( " salicylic @-@ acetic anhydride " ) was one of the many reactions Gerhardt conducted for his paper on anhydrides and he did not pursue it further . 
 Six years later , in 1859 , an Austrian chemist , Hugo von Gilm , obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic acid ( which he called <unk> Salicylsäure , acetylated salicylic acid ) by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetyl chloride . In 1869 , Schröder , Prinzhorn , and Kraut repeated both Gerhardt 's ( from sodium salicylate ) and von Gilm 's ( from salicylic acid ) syntheses and concluded both reactions gave the same compound — acetylsalicylic acid . They were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen . 
 In 1897 chemists working at Bayer AG produced a synthetically altered version of salicin , derived from the species <unk> ulmaria ( meadowsweet ) , which caused less digestive upset than pure salicylic acid . The identity of the lead chemist on this project is a matter of controversy . Bayer states the work was done by chemists Heinrich Dreser and Felix Hoffmann , but Jewish chemist Arthur Eichengrün later claimed he was the lead investigator and records of his contribution were expunged under the anti @-@ Semitic Nazi regime . The new drug , formally acetylsalicylic acid , was named Aspirin by Bayer AG after the original botanical name for meadowsweet , Spiraea ulmaria , derived from " acetyl " and Spirsäure , an old German name for salicylic acid derived from the Latin Spiraea ulmaria . By 1899 , Bayer was selling it around the world . The popularity of aspirin grew over the first half of the 20th century , spurred by its supposed effectiveness in the wake of the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 . However , recent research suggests that the high death toll of the 1918 flu may have been partly due to aspirin , though this is controversial and not universally accepted . This theory gained support when a recent repetition of the 1918 flu outbreak , with the same virus , had a low fatality rate . Aspirin 's profitability led to fierce competition and the proliferation of aspirin brands and products , especially after the American patent held by Bayer expired in 1917 . 
 The popularity of aspirin declined after the market releases of paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1969 . In the 1960s and 1970s , John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin 's effects , while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin 's efficacy as an <unk> agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases . Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the 20th century , and remain strong in the 21st century , because of its widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes . 
 The first studies of the effect of aspirin on cardiac function and stroke prevention were carried out by Professor Peter Sleight , Emeritus Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at Oxford University , in the early 1970s . Sleight and his research team at Oxford led the way and formed the foundation for the research into the use of aspirin in the prevention of other medical conditions . 
 = = = Trademark = = = 
 Due to allowing the use of " Aspirin " for years by other manufacturing chemists , despite the patent @-@ infringing nature of the use , and its own failure to use the name for its own product when it began selling direct , Bayer lost its trademark in 1918 , affirmed by court appeal in 1921 . Today , aspirin is a generic word in Australia , France , India , Ireland , New Zealand , Pakistan , Jamaica , Colombia , the Philippines , South Africa , Ghana , the United Kingdom and the United States . Aspirin , with a capital " A " , remains a registered trademark of Bayer in Germany , Canada , Mexico , and in over 80 other countries , where the trademark is owned by Bayer , using acetylsalicylic acid in all markets , but using different packaging and physical aspects for each .

 Aspirin is sometimes used for pain relief or as an anticoagulant in veterinary medicine , primarily in dogs and sometimes horses , although newer medications with fewer side effects are generally used instead . 
 Both dogs and horses are susceptible to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates , but it is a convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs , and has shown some promise in cases of laminitis in horses . It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis , as it could be counterproductive for treatment . Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian ; in particular , cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin , making it potentially toxic . No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25 mg / kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks . The dose recommended in cats for relief of pain and fever is 10 mg / kg every 48 hours .

 Cluj @-@ Napoca ( Romanian pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ) , commonly known as Cluj , is the second most populous city in Romania , after the national capital Bucharest , and the seat of Cluj County in the northwestern part of the country . Geographically , it is roughly equidistant from Bucharest ( 324 kilometres ( 201 miles ) ) , Budapest ( 351 km ( 218 mi ) ) and Belgrade ( 322 km ( 200 mi ) ) . Located in the Someșul Mic River valley , the city is considered the unofficial capital to the historical province of Transylvania . From 1790 to 1848 and from 1861 to 1867 , it was the official capital of the Grand Principality of Transylvania . Other names for the city include : German : Klausenburg ; Hungarian : Kolozsvár , Hungarian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ; Medieval Latin : Castrum Clus , <unk> ; and Yiddish : <unk> , <unk> . 
 As of 2011 , 324 @,@ 576 inhabitants live within the city limits , marking a slight increase from the figure recorded at the 2002 census . The Cluj @-@ Napoca metropolitan area has a population of 411 @,@ 379 people , while the population of the peri @-@ urban area ( Romanian : zona <unk> ) exceeds 420 @,@ 000 residents . The new metropolitan government of Cluj @-@ Napoca became operational in December 2008 . According to a 2007 estimate provided by the County Population Register Service , the city hosts a visible population of students and other non @-@ residents — an average of over 20 @,@ 000 people each year during 2004 – 2007 . The city spreads out from St. Michael 's Church in Unirii Square , built in the 14th century and named after the Archangel Michael , the patron saint of Cluj @-@ Napoca . The boundaries of the municipality contain an area of 179 @.@ 52 square kilometres ( 69 @.@ 31 sq mi ) . 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca experienced a decade of decline during the 1990s , its international reputation suffering from the policies of its mayor at the time , Gheorghe Funar . Today , the city is one of the most important academic , cultural , industrial and business centres in Romania . Among other institutions , it hosts the country 's largest university , Babeș @-@ Bolyai University , with its famous botanical garden ; nationally renowned cultural institutions ; as well as the largest Romanian @-@ owned commercial bank . In 2015 , Cluj @-@ Napoca was European Youth Capital . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 On the site of the city was a pre @-@ Roman settlement named Napoca . After the AD 106 Roman conquest of the area , the place was known as <unk> <unk> <unk> Napoca . Possible etymologies for Napoca or <unk> include the names of some Dacian tribes such as the <unk> or <unk> , the Greek term <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " timbered valley " or the Indo @-@ European root * <unk> @-@ <unk> ( Pokorny 971 @-@ 2 ) , " to flow , to swim , damp " . 
 The first written mention of the city 's current name – as a Royal Borough – was in 1213 under the Medieval Latin name Castrum Clus . Despite the fact that Clus as a county name was recorded in the 1173 document Thomas comes <unk> , it is believed that the county 's designation derives from the name of the castrum , which might have existed prior to its first mention in 1213 , and not vice versa . With respect to the name of this camp , it is widely accepted as a derivation from the Latin term clausa – <unk> , meaning " closed place " , " strait " , " ravine " . Similar senses are attributed to the Slavic term <unk> , meaning " a key " and the German <unk> – <unk> ( meaning " mountain pass " or " weir " ) . The Latin and Slavic names have been attributed to the valley that narrows or closes between hills just to the west of Cluj @-@ Mănăștur . An alternative hypothesis relates the name of the city to its first magistrate , <unk> – Miklós / <unk> . 
 The Hungarian form Kolozsvár , first recorded in 1246 as <unk> , underwent various phonetic changes over the years ( <unk> / <unk> means " castle " in Hungarian ) ; the variant <unk> first appears in a document from 1332 . Its Saxon name <unk> / <unk> appeared in 1348 , but from 1408 the form <unk> was used . The Romanian name of the city used to be spelled alternately as Cluj or <unk> , the latter being the case in Mihai Eminescu 's <unk> . In 1974 , the communist authorities added " <unk> " to the city 's name as a nationalist gesture , emphasising its pre @-@ Roman roots . The full name is rarely used outside of official contexts . In Yiddish it is known as <unk> ( <unk> ) or <unk> ( <unk> ) . The nickname " treasure city " was acquired in the late 16th century , and refers to the wealth amassed by residents , including in the precious metals trade . The phrase is <unk> <unk> in Hungarian , given in Romanian as <unk> <unk> .

 The Roman Empire conquered Dacia in AD 101 and 106 , during the rule of Trajan , and the Roman settlement Napoca , established thereafter , is first recorded on a milestone discovered in 1758 in the vicinity of the city . Trajan 's successor Hadrian granted Napoca the status of municipium as municipium <unk> <unk> <unk> . Later , in the 2nd century AD , the city gained the status of a colonia as Colonia Aurelia Napoca . Napoca became a provincial capital of Dacia <unk> and thus the seat of a procurator . The colonia was evacuated in 274 by the Romans . There are no references to urban settlement on the site for the better part of a millennium thereafter . 
 = = = Middle Ages = = = 
 At the beginning of the Middle Ages , two groups of buildings existed on the current site of the city : the wooden fortress at Cluj @-@ Mănăștur ( <unk> ) and the civilian settlement developed around the current Piața <unk> ( Museum Place ) in the city centre . Although the precise date of the conquest of Transylvania by the Hungarians is not known , the earliest Hungarian artifacts found in the region are dated to the first half of the 10th century . In any case , after that time , the city became part of the Kingdom of Hungary . King Stephen I made the city the seat of the castle county of Kolozs , and King Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary founded the abbey of Cluj @-@ Mănăștur ( <unk> ) , destroyed during the Tatar invasions in 1241 and 1285 . As for the civilian colony , a castle and a village were built to the northwest of the ancient Napoca no later than the late 12th century . This new village was settled by large groups of Transylvanian Saxons , encouraged during the reign of Crown Prince Stephen , Duke of Transylvania . The first reliable mention of the settlement dates from 1275 , in a document of King Ladislaus IV of Hungary , when the village ( Villa <unk> ) was granted to the Bishop of Transylvania . On 19 August 1316 , during the rule of the new king , Charles I of Hungary , Cluj was granted the status of a city ( Latin : civitas ) , as a reward for the Saxons ' contribution to the defeat of the rebellious Transylvanian voivode , Ladislaus Kán . 
 Many craft guilds were established in the second half of the 13th century , and a patrician stratum based in commerce and craft production displaced the older landed elite in the town 's leadership . Through the privilege granted by Sigismund of Luxembourg in 1405 , the city opted out from the jurisdiction of voivodes , vice @-@ voivodes and royal judges , and obtained the right to elect a twelve @-@ member jury every year . In 1488 , King Matthias Corvinus ( born in Kolozsvár in 1440 ) ordered that the <unk> — the city council , consisting of one hundred men — be half composed from the homines bone <unk> ( the wealthy people ) , with craftsmen supplying the other half ; together they would elect the chief judge and the jury . Meanwhile , an agreement was reached providing that half of the representatives on this city council were to be drawn from the Hungarian , half from the Saxon population , and that judicial offices were to be held on a rotating basis . In 1541 , Kolozsvár became part of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom ( that transformed to Principality of Transylvania in 1570 ) after the Ottoman Turks occupied the central part of the Kingdom of Hungary ; a period of economic and cultural prosperity followed . Although Alba Iulia ( Gyulafehérvár ) served as a political capital for the princes of Transylvania , Cluj ( Kolozsvár ) enjoyed the support of the princes to a greater extent , thus establishing connections with the most important centres of Eastern Europe at that time , along with Košice ( Kassa ) , Kraków , Prague and Vienna . 
 = = = 16th – 18th centuries = = = 
 In terms of religion , Protestant ideas first appeared in the middle of the 16th century . During Gáspár Heltai 's service as preacher , Lutheranism grew in importance , as did the Swiss doctrine of Calvinism . By 1571 , the Turda ( Torda ) Diet had adopted a more radical religion , Ferenc Dávid 's Unitarianism , characterised by the free interpretation of the Bible and denial of the dogma of the Trinity . Stephen Báthory founded a Catholic Jesuit academy in the city in order to promote an anti @-@ Reform movement ; however , it did not have much success . For a year , in 1600 – 1601 , Cluj became part of the personal union of Michael the Brave . Under the Treaty of <unk> in 1699 , it became part of the Habsburg Monarchy . 
 In the 17th century , Cluj suffered from great calamities , suffering from epidemics of the plague and devastating fires . The end of this century brought the end of Turkish sovereignty , but found the city bereft of much of its wealth , municipal freedom , cultural centrality , political significance and even population . It gradually regained its important position within Transylvania as the headquarters of the <unk> and the Diets between 1719 and 1732 , and again from 1790 until the revolution of 1848 , when the <unk> moved to Nagyszeben ( Hermannstadt ) , present @-@ day Sibiu ) . In 1791 , a group of Romanian intellectuals drew up a petition , known as <unk> Libellus <unk> , which was sent to the Emperor in Vienna . The petition demanded the equality of the Romanian nation in Transylvania in respect to the other nations ( Saxon , Szekler and Hungarian ) governed by the Unio <unk> <unk> , but it was rejected by the Diet of Cluj . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 Beginning in 1830 , the city became the centre of the Hungarian national movement within the principality . This erupted with the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 . At one point , the Austrians were gaining control of Transylvania , trapping the Hungarians between two flanks . But , the Hungarian army , headed by the Polish general Józef Bem , launched an offensive in Transylvania , recapturing Klausenburg by Christmas 1848 . After the 1848 revolution , an absolutist regime was established , followed by a liberal regime that came to power in 1860 . In this latter period , the government granted equal rights to the ethnic Romanians , but only briefly . In 1865 , the Diet in Cluj abolished the laws voted in Sibiu ( Nagyszeben / Hermannstadt , and proclaimed the 1848 Law concerning the Union of Transylvania with Hungary . A modern university was founded in 1872 , with the intention of promoting the integration of Transylvania into Hungary . Before 1918 , the city 's only Romanian @-@ language schools were two church @-@ run elementary schools , and the first printed Romanian periodical did not appear until 1903 . 
 After the Austro @-@ Hungarian Compromise of 1867 , Klausenburg and all of Transylvania were again integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary . During this time , Kolozsvár was among the largest and most important cities of the kingdom and was the seat of Kolozs County . Ethnic Romanians in Transylvania suffered oppression and persecution . Their grievances found expression in the Transylvanian Memorandum , a petition sent in 1892 by the political leaders of Transylvania 's Romanians to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Emperor @-@ King Franz Joseph . It asked for equal rights with the Hungarians and demanded an end to persecutions and attempts at Magyarisation . The Emperor forwarded the memorandum to Budapest — the Hungarian capital . The authors , among them Ioan <unk> and Iuliu <unk> , were arrested , tried and sentenced to prison for " high treason " in Kolozsvár / Cluj in May 1894 . During the trial , approximately 20 @,@ 000 people who had come to Cluj demonstrated on the streets of the city in support of the defendants . A year later , the King gave them pardon upon the advice of his Hungarian prime minister , Dezső Bánffy . In 1897 , the Hungarian government decided that only Hungarian place names should be used and prohibited the use of the German or Romanian versions of the city 's name on official government documents .

 In the autumn of 1918 , as World War I drew to a close , Cluj became a centre of revolutionary activity , headed by Amos <unk> . On 28 October 1918 , <unk> made an appeal for the organisation of the " union of all Romanians " . Thirty @-@ nine delegates were elected from Cluj to attend the proclamation of the union of Transylvania with the Kingdom of Romania in Alba @-@ Iulia on 1 December 1918 , later acknowledged internationally by the Treaty of Trianon . The interwar years saw the new authorities embark on a " <unk> " campaign : a Capitoline Wolf statue donated by Rome was set up in 1921 ; in 1932 a plaque written by historian Nicolae Iorga was placed on Matthias Corvinus 's statue , emphasising his Romanian paternal ancestry ; and construction of an imposing Orthodox cathedral began , in a city where only about a tenth of the inhabitants belonged to the Orthodox state church . This endeavour had only mixed results : by 1939 , Hungarians still dominated local economic ( and to a certain extent ) cultural life : for instance , Cluj had five Hungarian daily newspapers and just one in Romanian . 
 In 1940 , Cluj , along with the rest of Northern Transylvania , became part of Miklós Horthy 's Hungary through the Second Vienna Award arbitrated by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy . After the Germans occupied Hungary in March 1944 and installed a puppet government under <unk> <unk> , they forced large @-@ scale antisemitic measures in the city . The headquarters of the local Gestapo were located in the New York Hotel . That May , the authorities began the relocation of the Jews to the Iris ghetto . Liquidation of the 16 @,@ 148 captured Jews occurred through six deportations to Auschwitz in May – June 1944 . Despite facing severe sanctions from the Hungarian administration , some Jews escaped across the border to Romania , with the assistance of intellectuals such as Emil Hațieganu , Raoul <unk> , Aurel <unk> and Dezső <unk> , as well as various peasants from Mănăștur . 
 On 11 October 1944 the city was captured by Romanian and Soviet troops . It was formally restored to the Kingdom of Romania by the Treaty of Paris in 1947 . On 24 January 6 March and 10 May 1946 , the Romanian students , who had come back to Cluj after the restoration of northern Transylvania , rose against the claims of autonomy made by nostalgic Hungarians and the new way of life imposed by the Soviets , resulting in clashes and street fights . 
 The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 produced a powerful echo within the city ; there was a real possibility that demonstrations by students sympathizing with their peers across the border could escalate into an uprising . The protests provided the Romanian authorities with a pretext to speed up the process of " unification " of the local Babeș ( Romanian ) and Bolyai ( Hungarian ) universities , allegedly contemplated before the 1956 events . Hungarians remained the majority of the city 's population until the 1960s . Then Romanians began to outnumber Hungarians , due to the population increase as a result of the government 's forced industrialisation of the city and new jobs . During the Communist period , the city recorded a high industrial development , as well as enforced construction expansion . On 16 October 1974 , when the city celebrated 1850 years since its first mention as Napoca , the Communist government changed the name of the city by adding " Napoca " to it .

His tenure was marked by strong Romanian nationalism and acts of ethnic provocation against the Hungarian @-@ speaking minority . This deterred foreign investment ; however , in June 2004 , Gheorghe Funar was voted out of office , and the city entered a period of rapid economic growth .

 The city is surrounded by forests and grasslands . Rare species of plants , such as Venus 's slipper and iris , are found in the two botanical reservations of Cluj @-@ Napoca , <unk> Clujului and <unk> Valea <unk> ( " Mill Valley Reservation " ) . Animals such as boars , badgers , foxes , rabbits and squirrels live in nearby forest areas such as <unk> and Hoia . The latter forest hosts the Romulus Vuia ethnographical park , with exhibits dating back to 1678 . Various people report alien encounters in the Hoia @-@ <unk> forest , large networks of catacombs that connect the old churches of the city , or the presence of a monster in the nearby lake of <unk> . 
 A modern , 750 @-@ metre ( 820 yd ) -long ski resort sits on <unk> Hill , with an altitude difference of 98 metres ( 107 yd ) between its highest and lowest points . This ski resort offers outdoor lighting , artificial snow and a ski tow . <unk> winter resort is located approximately 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) from the city of Cluj @-@ Napoca , and includes two ski trails , for beginner and advanced skiers , respectively : <unk> Mic and <unk> Mare . Two other summer resorts / spas are included in the metropolitan area , namely <unk> and <unk> Baths . 
 There are a large number of castles in the countryside surroundings , constructed by wealthy medieval families living in the city . The most notable of them is the Bonțida Bánffy Castle — once known as " the Versailles of Transylvania " — in the nearby village of Bonțida , 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) from the city centre . In 1963 , the castle was used as a set for Liviu <unk> 's film Forest of the Hanged , which won an award at Cannes . There are other castles located in the vicinity of the city ; indeed , the castle at Bonțida is not even the only one constructed by the Bánffy family . The commune of Gilău features the Wass @-@ Bánffy Castle , while another Bánffy Castle is located in the <unk> area . In addition , <unk> Monastery , erected during the 18th century , is an important pilgrimage site in northern Transylvania . This monastery houses the renowned wonder @-@ working Madonna of <unk> . The icon is said to have wept between 15 February and 12 March 1669 . During this time , nobles , officers , laity and clergy came to see it . At first they were sceptical , looking at it on both sides , but then humbly crossed themselves and returned home petrified by the wonder they had seen .

 Cluj @-@ Napoca has a continental climate , characterised by warm dry summers and cold winters .

 The city government is headed by a mayor .

Decisions are approved and discussed by the local government ( <unk> local ) made up of 27 elected councillors . The city is divided into 15 districts ( <unk> ) laid out radially . City hall intends to develop local administrative branches for most of the districts . 
 Because of the last years ' massive urban development , in 2005 some areas of Cluj were named as districts ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> South ) , but most of them are still construction sites . Beside these , there are some other building areas like <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , which are likely to become districts in the following years . 
 Additionally , as Cluj @-@ Napoca is the capital of Cluj County , the city hosts the palace of the prefecture , the headquarters of the county council ( <unk> <unk> ) and the prefect , who is appointed by Romania 's central government . The prefect is not allowed to be a member of a political party , and his role is to represent the national government at the local level , acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of National Development Plans and governing programmes at the local level . Like all other local councils in Romania , the Cluj @-@ Napoca local council , the county council and the city 's mayor are elected every four years by the population . 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca is also the capital of the historical region of Transylvania , a status that resonates to this day . Currently , the city is the largest in the Nord @-@ Vest development region , which is equivalent to NUTS @-@ II regions in the European Union and is used by the European Union and the Romanian Government for statistical analysis and regional development . The Nord @-@ Vest development region is not , however , an administrative entity . The Cluj @-@ Napoca metropolitan area became operational in December 2008 , and comprises a population of 411 @,@ 379 . Besides Cluj @-@ Napoca , it includes seventeen communes : Aiton , <unk> , <unk> , Bonțida , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Gilău , <unk> , <unk> de Jos , <unk> and <unk> . 
 The executive presidium of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania ( <unk> ) and all its departments are headquartered in Cluj , as are local and regional organisations of most Romanian political parties . In order to counterbalance the political influence of Transylvania 's Hungarian minority , nationalist Romanians in Transylvania founded the Party of Romanian National Unity ( <unk> ) at the beginnings of the 1990s ; the party was present in the Romanian Parliament during the 1992 – 1996 legislature . The party eventually moved its main offices to Bucharest and fell into decline as its leadership joined the ideologically similar <unk> . In 2008 , the Institute for Research on National Minorities , subordinated to the Romanian Government , opened its official headquarters in Cluj @-@ Napoca .

 Cluj @-@ Napoca has a complex judicial organisation , as a consequence of its status of county capital . The Cluj @-@ Napoca Court of Justice is the local judicial institution and is under the purview of the Cluj County Tribunal , which also exerts its jurisdiction over the courts of Dej , <unk> , Turda and <unk> . Appeals from these tribunals ' verdicts , and more serious cases , are directed to the Cluj Court of Appeals . The city also hosts the county 's commercial and military tribunals . 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca has its own municipal police force , <unk> <unk> Cluj @-@ Napoca , which is responsible for policing of crime within the whole city , and operates a number of special divisions . The Cluj @-@ Napoca Police are headquartered on <unk> Street in the city centre ( with a number of precincts throughout the city ) and it is subordinated to the County 's Police Inspectorate on Traian Street .

 = = = Crime = = = 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca and the surrounding area ( Cluj County ) had a rate of 268 criminal convictions per 100 @,@ 000 inhabitants during 2006 , just above the national average . After the revolution in 1989 , the criminal conviction rate in the county entered a phase of sustained growth , reaching a historic high of 429 in 1998 , when it began to fall . Although the overall crime rate is reassuringly low , petty crime can be an irritant for foreigners , as in other large cities of Romania . During the 1990s , two large financial institutions , Banca Dacia Felix and Caritas , went bankrupt due to large @-@ scale fraud and embezzlement . 
 Also notorious was the case of serial killer Romulus <unk> , " the man with the hammer " ; during the 1970s , he was charged with five murders and several attempted murders , but never imprisoned on grounds of insanity : he suffered from schizophrenia , blaming the Devil for his actions . Instead , he was institutionalised in the <unk> psychiatric facility in 1976 , following a three @-@ year forensic investigation during which four thousand people were questioned . Urban myths brought the number of victims up to two hundred women , though the actual number was much smaller . This confusion is probably explained by the lack of attention this case received , despite its magnitude , in the Communist press of the time . 
 A 2006 poll shows a high degree of satisfaction with the work of the local police department . More than half the people surveyed during a 2005 – 2006 poll declared themselves satisfied ( 62 @.@ 3 % ) or very satisfied ( 3 @.@ 3 % ) with the activity of the county police department . The study found the highest satisfaction with car traffic supervision , the presence of officers in the street , and road education ; on the negative side , corruption and public transport safety remain concerns . 
 Efforts made by local authorities in the Cluj @-@ Napoca district at the end of the 1990s to reform the protection of children 's rights and assistance for street children proved insufficient due to lack of funding , incoherent policies and the absence of any real collaboration between the actors involved ( Child Rights Protection Directorate , Social Assistance Service within the District Directorate for Labour and Social Protection , Minors Receiving Centre , Guardian Authority within the City Hall , Police ) . There are numerous street children , whose poverty and lack of documented identity brings them into constant conflict with local law enforcement . 
 Following cooperation between the local governmental council and the Prison Fellowship Romania Foundation , homeless people , street children and beggars are taken , identified and accommodated within the Christian Centers for Street Children and Homeless People , respectively , and the Ruhama centre . The latter features a marshaling center for beggars and street children , as well as a flophouse . As a consequence , the fluctuating movement of children , beggars and homeless people in and out of the centre has been considerably reduced , with most of the initial beneficiaries successfully integrated into the programme rather than returning to the streets . 
 From 2000 onwards , Cluj @-@ Napoca has seen an increase in illegal road races , which occur mainly at night on the city 's outskirts or on industrial sites and occasionally produce victims . There have been attempts to organize legal races as a solution to this problem . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 The city 's population , at the 2011 census , was 324 @,@ 576 inhabitants , or 1 @.@ 6 % of the total population of Romania . The population of the Cluj @-@ Napoca metropolitan area is estimated at 411 @,@ 379 . Finally , the population of the peri @-@ urban area numbers over 420 @,@ 000 residents . The new metropolitan government of Cluj @-@ Napoca became operational in December 2008 . According to the 2007 data provided by the County Population Register Service , the total population of the city is as high as 392 @,@ 276 people . The variation between this number and the census data is partially explained by the real growth of the population residing in Cluj @-@ Napoca , as well as by different counting methods : " In reality , more people live in Cluj than those who are officially registered " , Traian <unk> , director of the Center for Population Studies , told <unk> <unk> . Moreover , this number does not include the floating population — an average of over 20 thousand people each year during 2004 – 2007 , according to the same source . 
 In the modern era , Cluj 's population experienced two phases of rapid growth , the first in the late 19th century , when the city grew in importance and size , and the second during the Communist period , when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas and from beyond the Carpathians to the county 's capital . About two @-@ thirds of the population growth during this era was based on net migration inflows ; after 1966 , the date of Ceaușescu 's ban on abortion and contraception , natural increase was also significant , being responsible for the remaining third . 
 From the Middle Ages onwards , the city of Cluj has been a multicultural city with a diverse cultural and religious life . According to the 2011 Romanian census , of those for whom data are available , 81 @.@ 5 % of the population of the city are ethnic Romanians , with the second largest ethnic group being the Hungarians , who make up 16 @.@ 4 % of the population . The remainder is composed of Romani ( 1 @.@ 1 % ) , Germans ( 0 @.@ 18 % ) , Jews ( 0 @.@ 05 % ) and others ( 0 @.@ 7 % ) . ( Those for whom data were unavailable accounted for 7 @.@ 1 % . ) Today , the city receives a large influx of migrants : 25 @,@ 000 people requested residence in the city during 2007 . 
 In terms of religion , among those for whom there were data , 71 @.@ 3 % of the population in 2011 were Romanian Orthodox and 10 @.@ 6 % were Reformed . The Roman Catholic and the Romanian Greek @-@ Catholic communities claimed 5 @.@ 0 % and 4 @.@ 7 % of the population respectively , while other religious groups like Pentecostals ( 2 @.@ 7 % ) , Baptists ( 1 @.@ 2 % ) , or Unitarians ( 1 @.@ 0 % ) rounded out most of the rest . ( Data were unavailable for 7 @.@ 9 % of inhabitants . ) By contrast , in 1930 , the city was 26 @.@ 7 % Reformed , 22 @.@ 6 % Greek Catholic , 20 @.@ 1 % Roman Catholic , 13 @.@ 4 % Jewish , 11 @.@ 8 % Orthodox , 2 @.@ 4 % Lutheran and 2 @.@ 1 % Unitarian . Contributing factors for these shifts were the extermination and emigration of the city 's Jews , the outlawing of the Greek @-@ Catholic Church ( 1948 – 89 ) and the gradual decline in the Hungarian population . 
 On a more historical note , the Jewish community has figured centrally in the history of Transylvania , and in that of the wider region . They were a substantial and increasingly vibrant presence in Cluj in the modern era , contributing significantly to the town 's economic dynamism and cultural flourishing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Although the community comprised a significant share of the town 's population during the interwar era — between 13 and 15 percent — this figure plummeted as a consequence of the Holocaust and emigration ; by the 1990s only a few hundred Jews remained in Cluj @-@ Napoca . 
 In the 14th century , most of the town 's inhabitants and the local elite were Saxons , largely descended from settlers brought in by the Kings of Hungary in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries to develop and defend the southern borders of the province . By the middle of the next century roughly half the population had Hungarian names . In Transylvania as a whole , the Reformation sharpened ethnic divisions : Saxons became Lutheran while Hungarians either remained Catholic or became Calvinist or Unitarian . In Kolozsvár , however , the religious lines were blurred . Isolated both geographically from the main areas of German settlement in southern Transylvania and institutionally because of their distinctive religious trajectory , many Saxons eventually assimilated to the Hungarian majority over several generations . New settlers to the town largely spoke Hungarian , a language that many Saxons gradually adopted . ( In the seventeenth century , out of more than thirty royal free towns , only seven had a Hungarian majority , with Kolozsvár / Klausenburg being one of them ; the rest were largely German @-@ dominated . ) In this manner Kolozsvár became largely Hungarian speaking and would remain so through the mid @-@ 20th century , though 4 @.@ 8 % of its residents identified as German as late as 1880 . 
 The Roma form a sizable minority in contemporary Romania , and a small but visible presence in Cluj @-@ Napoca : self @-@ identifying Roma in the city comprise only 1 percent of the population ; yet they are a familiar presence in and around the central market , selling flowers , used clothes and <unk> . They are an important object of public discourse and media representation at the national level ; however , Cluj @-@ Napoca , with its small Roma population , has not been a major focus of Roma ethno @-@ political activity . 
 = = = Hungarian community = = = 
 Almost 50 @,@ 000 Hungarians live in Cluj @-@ Napoca . The city is home to the second @-@ largest urban Hungarian community in Romania , after Târgu Mureș , with an active cultural and academic life : the city features a Hungarian state theatre and opera , as well as Hungarian research institutions , like Erdélyi <unk> <unk> ( EME ) , Erdélyi Magyar <unk> <unk> <unk> and Bolyai <unk> . With respect to religious affairs , the city houses central offices for the Reformed Diocese of Transylvania , the Unitarian Diocese and an Evangelical Lutheran Church Diocese ( all of which train their clergy at the Protestant Theological Institute of Cluj ) . Several newspapers and magazines are published in the Hungarian language , yet the community also receives public and private television and radio broadcasts ( see Media ) . As of 2007 , 7 @,@ 000 students attended courses in the 55 Hungarian @-@ language specialisations at the Babeș @-@ Bolyai University . Gheorghe Funar , mayor of Cluj @-@ Napoca from 1992 to 2004 , was notorious for acts of ethnic provocation , <unk> the city 's streets in the colours of the Romanian flag and arranging pickets outside the city 's Hungarian consulate ; however , tensions have subsided since . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca is an important economic centre in Romania . Famous local brands that have become well @-@ known at a national , and to some extent even international level , include : Banca Transilvania , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Ursus breweries . 
 The American online magazine InformationWeek reports that much of the software / IT activity in Romania is taking place in Cluj @-@ Napoca , which is quickly becoming Romania 's <unk> . Nokia invested 200 million euros in a mobile telephone factory near Cluj @-@ Napoca ; this began production in February 2008 and closed in December 2011 . It also opened a research centre in the city that was shut down in April 2011 . The former Nokia factory was purchased by Italian appliance manufacturer De 'Longhi . The city houses regional or national headquarters of MOL , Aegon , Emerson , De 'Longhi , Bechtel , <unk> , Office Depot , <unk> and New Yorker . Bosch has also built a factory near Cluj @-@ Napoca , in the same industrial park as De 'Longhi . 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca is also an important regional commercial centre , with many street malls and hypermarkets . Eroilor Avenue and Napoca and <unk> streets are the most expensive venues , with a yearly rent price of 720 euro / m ² , but Regele Ferdinand and 21 <unk> 1989 avenues also feature high rental costs . There are two large malls : <unk> ( including a Carrefour hypermarket ) and Iulius Mall ( including an <unk> hypermarket ) . Other large stores include branches of various international hypermarket chains , like Cora , Metro , <unk> and do @-@ it @-@ yourself stores such as <unk> and <unk> . 
 Among the retailers found in the city 's shopping centers are H & M , Zara , Guess , <unk> , <unk> , Orsay , <unk> , <unk> , Triumph , Tommy Hilfiger , Sephora , Yves Rocher , Swarovski , Ecco , Bata , Adidas , Converse and Nike . 
 In 2008 , the city 's general budget amounted to 990 million lei , the equivalent of over 266 million Euros ( 207 million pounds sterling ) . Over the previous year , the budget increased 19 % in 2006 , 56 % in 2007 and 35 % in 2008 .

 = = Arts and culture = = 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca has a diverse and growing cultural scene , with cultural life exhibited in a number of fields , including the visual arts , performing arts and nightlife . The city 's cultural scene spans its history , dating back to Roman times : the city started to be built in that period , which has left its mark on the urban layout ( centered on today 's Piața <unk> ) as well as surviving ruins . However , the medieval town saw a shift in its centre towards new civil and religious structures , notably St. Michael 's Church . 
 During the 16th century the city became the chief cultural and religious centre of Transylvania ; in the 1820s and the first half of the 1830s , Kolozsvár was the most important centre for Hungarian theatre and opera , while at the beginning of the 20th century , still a Hungarian city , it became the chief alternative to the cinematography of Budapest . After its incorporation into the Kingdom of Romania at the end of World War I , the renamed Cluj saw a resurgence of its Romanian culture , most conspicuous in the completion of the monumental Orthodox cathedral in 1933 across from the ( newly nationalised ) Romanian National Theatre . This marked an unambiguously " Romanian " centre , a few blocks to the east of the old Hungarian centre ; however , the Romanian @-@ ness of the town — like the Romanian hold on Transylvania — was by no means securely established even by the end of the interwar period . The late 1960s brought a revival of nationalist discourse , concomitant with the urbanisation and industrialisation of the city that gradually advanced the <unk> of the city . Nowadays , the city is home to people of different cultures , with corresponding cultural institutions such as the Hungarian State Theatre , as well as the British Council and various other centres for the promotion of foreign cultures . These institutions hold eclectic manifestations in honour of their cultures , including Bessarabian , Hungarian , Tunisian , and Japanese . Nevertheless , contemporary cultural manifestations cross ethnic boundaries , being aimed at students , cinephiles , and arts and science lovers , among others . 
 = = = Landmarks = = = 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca has a number of landmark buildings and monuments . One of those is the Saint Michael 's Church in Unirii Square , built at the end of the 14th century in the Gothic style of that period . It was only in the 19th century that the Neo @-@ Gothic tower of the church was erected ; it remains the tallest church tower in Romania to this day . 
 In front of the church is the equestrian statue of Matthias Corvinus , erected in honour of the locally born King of Hungary . The Orthodox Church 's equivalent to St. Michael 's Church is the Orthodox Cathedral on Avram Iancu Square , built in the interwar era . The Romanian Greek @-@ Catholic Church also has a cathedral in Cluj @-@ Napoca , Transfiguration Cathedral . 
 Another landmark of Cluj @-@ Napoca is the Palace of Justice , built between 1898 and 1902 , and designed by architect Gyula Wagner in an eclectic style . This building is part of an ensemble erected in Avram Iancu Square that also includes the National Theatre , the Palace of <unk> <unk> Române , the Palace of the Prefecture , the Palace of Finance and the Palace of the Orthodox Metropolis . An important eclectic ensemble is Iuliu Maniu Street , featuring symmetrical buildings on either side , after the Haussmann <unk> trend . A highlight of the city is the botanical garden , situated in the vicinity of the centre . Beside this garden , Cluj @-@ Napoca is also home to some large parks , the most notable being the Central Park with the Chios Casino and a large statuary ensemble . Many of the city 's notable figures are buried in <unk> Cemetery , which covers 14 hectares ( 35 acres ) . 
 As an important cultural centre , Cluj @-@ Napoca has many theatres and museums . The latter include the National Museum of Transylvanian History , the Ethnographic Museum , the Cluj @-@ Napoca Art Museum , the Pharmacy Museum , the Water Museum and the museums of Babeș @-@ Bolyai University — the University Museum , the Museum of Mineralogy , the Museum of Paleontology and Stratigraphy , the Museum of <unk> , the Botanical Museum and the Zoological Museum . 
 = = = Visual arts = = = 
 In terms of visual arts , the city contains a number of galleries featuring both classical and contemporary Romanian art , as well as selected international works . 
 The National Museum of Art is located in the former palace of the count György Bánffy , the most representative secular construction built in the Baroque style in Transylvania . The museum features extensive collections of Romanian art , including works of artists like Nicolae Grigorescu , Ștefan Luchian and Dimitrie Paciurea , as well as some works of foreign artists like Károly <unk> , Luca Giordano , Jean @-@ Hippolyte <unk> , Herri met de <unk> and Claude Michel , and was nominated to be European Museum of the Year in 1996 . 
 The most notable of the city 's other galleries is the Gallery of the Union of Plastic Artists . Situated in the city centre , this gallery presents collections drawn from the contemporary arts scene . The Gallery of Folk Art includes traditional Romanian interior decoration artworks . 
 Historically , the city was one of the most important cultural and artistic centres in 16th @-@ century Transylvania . The Renaissance workshop , formed in 1530 and strongly supported by the Transylvanian princes , served local and wider requirements : from the middle of the century onwards , when the Ottomans had conquered central Hungary , it extended its activity throughout the new principality . Its style , the " Flower Renaissance " , used a variety of plant ornament enriched with coats of arms , figures and inscriptions . It continued to be of great importance into the 18th century , and traces of it are still apparent in 20th @-@ century vernacular art ; Klausenburg was central to the long , anachronistic survival of the style , particularly among Hungarians . 
 = = = Performing arts = = = 
 The city has a number of renowned facilities and institutions involving performing arts . The most prominent is the Neo @-@ baroque theatre at the Avram Iancu Square . Built at the beginning of the 20th century by the Viennese company Helmer and Fellner , this structure is inscribed in UNESCO 's list of specially protected monuments . Since 1919 , shortly after the union of Transylvania with Romania , the building has hosted the Lucian <unk> National Theatre and the Romanian National Opera . The Transylvania <unk> , founded in 1955 , gives classical music concerts . The multiculturalism in the city is once again attested by the Hungarian Theatre and Opera , home for four professional groups of performers . There is also a number of smaller independent theatres , including the Puck Theatre , where puppet shows are performed . 
 = = = Music and nightlife = = = 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca is the residence of some well @-@ known Romanian musicians . Examples of homegrown bands include the popular Romanian rock band Compact , the modern pop band <unk> — which finished third in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 , the rhythm and blues band <unk> , the alternative band Luna <unk> , <unk> — the winners of the 2007 National Finals of Global Battle of the Bands , as well as a large assortment of electronic music producers , notably Horace Dan D. The Cheeky Girls also grew up in the city , where they studied at the High School of Choreography and Dramatic Art . While many discos play commercial house music , the city has an increasing minimal techno scene , and , to an extent jazz / blues and heavy metal / punk . The city 's nightlife , particularly its club scene , grew significantly in the 1990s , and continues to increase . Most entertainment venues are dispersed throughout the city centre , spreading from the oldest one of all , Diesel Club , on Unirii Square . The list of large and fancy clubs continues with Obsession The Club and Midi , the latter being a venue for the new minimal techno music genre . These three clubs are classified as the top three clubs in the Transylvania @-@ Banat region in a chart published by the national daily România <unk> . The Unirii area also features the Fashion Bar , with an exclusive terrace sponsored by Fashion TV . Some other clubs in the centre are <unk> , Avenue , Bamboo , Decadence , Kharma and Molotov Pub . Numerous restaurants , pizzerias and coffee shops provide regional as well as international cuisine ; many of these offer cultural activities like music and fashion shows or art exhibitions . 
 The city also includes Strada <unk> ( slanted street ) , a central nightlife strip located in the <unk> student area , where a large number of bars and terraces are situated . Cluj @-@ Napoca is not limited to these international music genres , as there are also a number of discos where local " <unk> " play <unk> , a Turkish @-@ influenced type of music . 
 = = = Traditional culture = = = 
 In spite of the influences of modern culture , traditional Romanian culture continues to influence various domains of art . 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca hosts an ethnographic museum , the Ethnographic Museum of Transylvania , which features a large indoor collection of traditional cultural objects , as well as an open @-@ air park , the oldest of this kind in Romania , dating back to 1929 . 
 The National Museum of Transylvanian History is another important museum in Cluj @-@ Napoca , containing a collection of artefacts detailing Romanian history and culture from prehistoric times , the Dacian era , medieval times and the modern era . Moreover , the city also preserves a Historic Collection of the Pharmacy , in the building of the its first pharmacy ( 16th century ) , the <unk> House . 
 = = = Cultural events and festivals = = = 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca hosts a number of cultural festivals of various types . These occur throughout the year , though are more frequent in the summer months . " <unk> <unk> " ( Fête de la Musique ) is a music festival taking place yearly on 21 June in a number of Romanian cities , Cluj @-@ Napoca included , organised under the aegis of the French Cultural Centre . Additionally , <unk> Independenței , on the banks of Someșul Mic River , hosts a number of beer festivals throughout the summer , among them the " <unk> " , modelled after the German Oktoberfest . In 2015 , the city will be the European Youth Capital , an event with a budget of 5 @.@ 7 million euros that is projected to boost tourism by about a fifth . 
 The city has seen a number of important music events , including the MTV România Music Award ceremony which was held at the Sala Sporturilor Horia Demian in 2006 with the Sugababes , <unk> and Uniting Nations as special international guests . In 2007 , Beyoncé Knowles also performed in Cluj @-@ Napoca , at the Ion <unk> Stadium . In 2010 , Iron Maiden included the city in their Final Frontier World Tour . The Cluj Arena was inaugurated in 2011 with concerts by Scorpions and Smokie , the main event drawing over 40 @,@ 000 people ; other events followed , for instance Roxette in 2012 and Deep Purple in 2013 . Smaller events occur regularly at the <unk> Hall , the Opera and the Students ' House of Culture . Moreover , the local clubs regularly organise events featuring international artists , usually foreign disc jockeys , like André <unk> , Sasha , Timo Maas , Tania Vulcano , Satoshi <unk> , Yves <unk> , Dave Seaman , Plump DJs , Stephane K or Andy Fletcher . 
 The Transilvania International Film Festival ( TIFF ) , held in the city since 2001 and organised by the Association for the Promotion of the Romanian Film , is the first Romanian film festival for international features . The festival jury awards the Transilvania Trophy for the best film in competition , as well as prizes for best director , best performance and best photography . With the support of Home Box Office , TIFF also organises a national script contest . Comedy Cluj , which debuted in 2009 , is the newest annual film festival organised in Cluj @-@ Napoca . 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> , Romania 's most important classical music event after the George Enescu Festival , has taken place annually since 1965 , and is run by the Transylvania State Philharmonic Orchestra .

 = = Architecture = = 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca 's salient architecture is primarily Renaissance , Baroque and Gothic . The modern era has also produced a remarkable set of buildings from the mid @-@ century style . The mostly utilitarian Communist @-@ era architecture is also present , although only to a certain extent , as Cluj @-@ Napoca never faced a large systematisation programme . Of late , the city has seen significant growth in contemporary structures such as skyscrapers and office buildings , mainly constructed after 2000 . 
 = = = Historical architecture = = = 
 The nucleus of the old city , an important cultural and commercial centre , used to be a military camp , attested in documents with the name " castrum Clus " . 
 The oldest residence in Cluj @-@ Napoca is the Matthias Corvinus House , originally a Gothic structure that bears Transylvanian Renaissance characteristics due to a later renovation . Such changes feature on other Hungarian townspeople 's residences , built from the mid @-@ 15th century mostly of stone and wood with a cellar , ground floor and upper storey , in the Late Gothic and Renaissance styles ; although the late medieval houses have often been considerably altered , the street façades of the old town are mostly preserved . St. Michael 's Church , the oldest and most representative Gothic @-@ style building in the country , dates back to the 14th century . The oldest of its sections is the altar , dedicated in 1390 , while the newest part is the clock tower , which was built in Gothic Revival style ( 1860 ) . 
 As Renaissance styles survived late in the city , the appearance of Baroque art was also delayed , but from the mid @-@ 18th century Klausenburg was once again at the centre of the development and spread of art in Transylvania , as it had been two centuries earlier . The first enthusiasts for Baroque were the Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy . Artists came initially from south Germany and Austria , but by the end of the century most of the work was by local craftsmen . The earliest signs of the new style appear in the furnishings of St. Michael 's church : the altarpieces and pulpit , which date to the 1740s , are carved , painted and richly decorated with figures . An altarpiece depicting the Adoration of the Magi ( 1748 – 50 ) is the work of Franz Anton <unk> . The earliest two @-@ towered Baroque church was built by the Jesuits from 1718 to 1724 on the pattern of Košice and was later handed over to the Piarists . During the century more simply designed Baroque churches were built for the mendicant orders , Lutherans , Unitarians and the Orthodox Church . The noble families built houses and even palaces in the old town . The Baroque Bánffy Palace ( 1774 – 1785 ) , constructed around a rectangular yard , is the masterpiece of Eberhardt <unk> . Its peculiarity lies in the appearance of the principal façade . 
 Both Avram Iancu and <unk> Squares feature ensembles of eclectic and baroque – rococo architecture , including the Palace of Justice , the Theatre , the Iuliu Maniu symmetrical street , and the New York Palace , among others . In the 19th century many houses were built in the Neo @-@ classical , Romantic and Eclectic styles . Also dating to that period are the two @-@ towered Neo @-@ classical Calvinist church ( 1829 – 50 ) , its new college building of 1801 , and the City Hall ( 1843 – 46 ) in the marketplace , by Antal <unk> . 
 The banks of the Someșul Mic also feature a wide variety of such old buildings . The end of the 19th century brought a building ensemble that fastens the corners of the oldest bridge over the river , at the north end of the Regele Ferdinand Avenue . The Berde , Babos , Elian , Urania , and <unk> palaces consist of a mixture of Baroque , Renaissance and Gothic styles , following the Art Nouveau / Secession and Revival specifics . 
 In the 2000s , the old city centre underwent extensive restoration works , meant to convert much of it into a pedestrian area , including <unk> Eroilor , Unirii Square and other smaller streets . In some residential areas of the city , particularly the high @-@ income southern areas , like Andrei <unk> or Strada <unk> , there are many turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ century villas . 
 = = = Modern and Communist architecture = = = 
 Part of Cluj @-@ Napoca 's architecture is made up of buildings constructed during the Communist era , when historical architecture was replaced with " more efficient " high @-@ density apartment blocks . Nicolae Ceaușescu 's project of systematisation did not really affect the heart of the city , instead reaching the marginal , shoddily built districts surrounding it . 
 Still , the centre hosts some examples of modern architecture dating back to the Communist era . The Hungarian Theatre building was erected at the beginning of the 20th century , but underwent an avant @-@ garde renovation in 1961 , when it acquired a modernist style of architecture . Another example of modernist architectural art is Palatul <unk> , situated in the vicinity of Mihai Viteazul Square , an area that also features a complex of large apartment buildings . 
 Some outer districts , especially Mănăștur , and to a certain extent <unk> and Grigorescu , consist mainly of such large apartment ensembles . 
 = = = Contemporary architecture = = = 
 Since 1989 , modern skyscrapers and glass @-@ fronted buildings have altered the skyline of Cluj @-@ Napoca . Buildings from this time are mostly made out of glass and steel , and are usually high @-@ rise . Examples include shopping malls ( particularly the Iulius Mall ) , office buildings and bank headquarters . Of this last , regional headquarters of the Banca Română pentru <unk> is the tallest office building in Cluj @-@ Napoca , with 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . Its twelve storeys were completed in 1997 after 4 years of work and house offices for the bank and for divisions of several other companies , including insurance and oil companies . 
 Another architecturally interesting building is the so @-@ called " <unk> <unk> " ( the biscuit building ) . This building was supposed to house the local headquarters of the Banca <unk> ( Agricultural Bank ) , but entered in the custody of the city due to the failure of that bank in the 1990s and its subsequent purchase by the <unk> Bank , to be eventually converted in an office building . 
 The headquarters of Banca Transilvania , at the intersection of Regele Ferdinand Avenue and <unk> Street , is also a large contemporary building and was originally constructed to host the regional offices of <unk> , the public phone company , but was later sold to the bank . 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca is undergoing a period of architectural revitalisation that is set to bring the manner of expansion to the vertical . A financial centre , containing a tower of 15 storeys , is slated for completion in 2010 on Ploiești Street . Two 35 @-@ storey twin towers are projected to be constructed in the Sigma area in <unk> , while the <unk> area will host a complex of three towers with 32 levels each . 
 = = Transport = = 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca has a complex system of regional transportation , providing road , air and rail connections to major cities in Romania and Europe . It also features a public transportation system consisting of bus , trolleybus and tram lines . 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca is an important node in the European road network , being on three different European routes ( E60 , <unk> and <unk> ) . At a national level , Cluj @-@ Napoca is located on three different main national roads : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The Romanian Motorway A3 , also known as Transylvania Motorway ( <unk> Transilvania ) , currently under construction , will link the city with Bucharest and Romania 's western border . The 2B section between <unk> <unk> and Cluj Vest ( Gilău ) opened in late 2010 . The Cluj @-@ Napoca Coach Station ( <unk> ) is used by several private transport companies to provide coach connections from Cluj @-@ Napoca to a large number of locations from all over the country . 
 The number of automobiles licensed in Cluj @-@ Napoca is estimated at 175 @,@ 000 . As of 2007 , Cluj County ranks sixth nationwide according to the cars sold during that year , with 12 @,@ 679 units , corresponding to a four percent share . One tenth of these cars were limousines or SUVs . Some 3 @,@ 300 taxis are also licensed to operate in Cluj @-@ Napoca . 
 CTP , the local public transport company , runs an extensive 321 kilometres ( 199 mi ) public transport network within the city using 3 tram lines , 6 trolleybus lines and 21 bus routes . Transport in the Cluj @-@ Napoca metropolitan area is also covered by a number of private bus companies , such as <unk> and MV Trans 2007 , providing connections to neighboring towns and villages . 
 The Cluj @-@ Napoca International Airport ( <unk> ) , located 9 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) to the east of the city centre , is the second busiest airport in Romania , after Bucharest 's OTP , handling over 1 @.@ 4 million passengers in 2015 . Situated on the European route <unk> ( Cluj @-@ Napoca – Dej ) , the airport is connected to the city centre by the local public transport company , CTP , bus number 8 . The airport serves various direct international destinations across Europe . In 2016 , a 42 m @-@ high control tower will be inaugurated on the site of the old tower , built in 1960s . The new control tower will be one of the most modern in the country . 
 Cluj @-@ Napoca Rail Station , located about 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) north of the city centre , is situated on the CFR @-@ Romanian Railways Main Line 300 ( Bucharest – Oradea – Romanian Western Border ) and on Line 401 ( Cluj @-@ Napoca – Dej ) . CFR provides direct rail connections to all the major Romanian cities and to Budapest . The rail station is very well connected to all parts of the city by the trams , trolleybuses and buses of the local public transport company , CTP . 
 The city is also served by two other secondary rail stations , the Little Station ( Gara <unk> ) , which is technically part of and situated immediately near the main station , and Cluj @-@ Napoca East ( Est ) . There is also a cargo station , <unk> " <unk> " . 
 The local transportation company , CTP , manages a tram line that runs through the city . Planned modernisation will involve the installation of new rail tracks and the separation of the tram route from road traffic . This will bring a number of advantages , including vibration and shock reduction , a substantial noise decrease , long use expectancy and higher transit speed – 60 kilometres per hour ( 37 mph ) <unk> kilometres per hour ( 50 mph ) . The route will undergo major alteration on Horea Street , between the Chamber of Commerce and the central rail station , a rather problematic area . This dilemma should be solved either with the relocation of the track next to the sidewalk , or through the construction of a suspended tunnel . Another area that will benefit from large @-@ scale changes is " <unk> Independenței " , where the tracks will be pulled back to the Central Park , so that the roadway can host two lanes . In the Mănăștur area , under the bridge , the tracks will be brought closer , while other major works will executed on the traffic circle on <unk> Street . Given the development of the metropolitan area , further plans feature the creation of a light rail track between Gilău and <unk> that will use these modernised tracks in the city .

Napoca Cable Network is available through cable , and broadcasts local content throughout the day . Other stations work as affiliates of national TV stations , only providing the audience with local reports in addition to the national programming . This situation is mirrored in the radio broadcasting companies : except for Radio Cluj , Radio <unk> and the Hungarian @-@ language Paprika <unk> , all other stations are local affiliates of the national broadcasters . Casa Radio , situated on Donath Street , is one of the modern landmarks of the media and communications industry ; it is , however , not the only one : Palatul <unk> ( " the telephone palace " ) is also a major modernist symbol of communications in the city centre .

Moreover , the Romanian @-@ language film Cartier ( " Neighbourhood " , 2001 ) and its sequel <unk> în <unk> ( " Back to the Neighbourhood " , 2006 ) both feature a story replete with violence and rude language , behind the blocks in the city 's Mănăștur district . This district is also mentioned in the lyrics to the song <unk> în <unk> by La Familia member Puya , featured on the soundtrack of the motion picture . 
 Documentary and mockumentary productions set in the city include Irshad Ashraf 's St. Richard of Austin , a tribute to the American film director Richard Linklater , and Cluj @-@ <unk> , a mockumentary imagining a fabulous city of the future .

 Higher education has a long tradition in Cluj @-@ Napoca . The Babeș @-@ Bolyai University ( <unk> ) is the largest in the country , with approximately 50 @,@ 000 students attending various specialisations in Romanian , Hungarian , German and English . Its name commemorates two important Transylvanian figures , the Romanian physician Victor Babeș and the Hungarian mathematician János Bolyai . The university claims roots as far back as 1581 , when a Jesuit college opened in Cluj , but it was in 1872 that emperor Franz Joseph founded the University of Cluj , later renamed the Franz Joseph University ( József Ferenc <unk> ) . During 1919 , immediately after the end of World War I , the university was moved to Budapest , where it stayed until 1921 , after which it was moved to the Hungarian city of Szeged . Briefly , it returned to Cluj in the first half of the 1940s , when the city came back under Hungarian administration , but it was again relocated in Szeged , following the reincorporation of Cluj into Romanian territory . The Romanian branch acquired the name Babeș ; a Hungarian university , Bolyai , was established in 1945 , and the two were merged in 1959 . The city also hosts nine other universities , among them the Technical University , the Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy , the <unk> , the University of Arts and Design , the Gheorghe Dima Music Academy and other private universities and educational institutes . 
 The first mention of public education provided in the city dates back to 1409 , namely the caption " Caspar <unk> et rector <unk> " ( " Caspar secretary and director of schools " ) . Concomitantly , a Catholic school founded during the 14th century also functioned in the city . Today close to 150 pre @-@ university educational institutions operate in Cluj @-@ Napoca , including 62 kindergartens , 30 primary schools and 45 high schools . Their activity is supervised by the County Board for Education . Most schools are taught in Romanian ; nonetheless , there are some Hungarian @-@ language schools ( Báthory István , <unk> <unk> János and <unk> Sámuel high schools ) , as well as mixed schools — e. g . George Coșbuc and <unk> Ghibu high schools with Romanian / German classes and Romanian / Hungarian classes , respectively .

 Football in the city features four clubs playing in the leagues organised by the Romanian Football Federation , including two teams participating in Liga 1 — formerly Divizia A — the top division in the Romanian football association . CFR 1907 Cluj @-@ Napoca ( founded in 1907 ) is the oldest established team in the Romanian Championship . During the 2007 – 2008 season , it won the Romanian Championship and the Romanian Cup for the first time in its history . The 2009 – 2010 season was the second season in which CFR Cluj won both the Liga I and the Romanian Cup .

 = Cyclone Japhet = 
 Cyclone Japhet was a damaging tropical cyclone that affected southeast Africa in March 2003 . It developed on February 25 near the southwest coast of Madagascar , and initially moved to the northwest before turning to the southwest . With favorable conditions for development , Japhet quickly intensified in the Mozambique Channel , reaching maximum winds of 175 km / h ( 109 mph ) , sustained over 10 minutes . After stalling briefly , the cyclone turned to the northwest , weakening slightly before striking Mozambique just south of Vilankulo on March 2 . Japhet slowly weakened while progressing inland , dissipating over Zambia on March 6 . 
 Along its path , Japhet dropped heavy rainfall that caused widespread river flooding . The rains occurred after an extended drought , although excessive precipitation caused heavy crop damage , notably around where the storm moved ashore . In two provinces in Mozambique , the cyclone damaged or destroyed 25 @,@ 000 houses , leaving at least 23 @,@ 000 people homeless . Flooding in Zambia caused rivers to rise in Mozambique several days after the storm 's passage . There were 17 deaths in Mozambique . Further inland , remnant rainfall destroyed a bridge and several houses in Zimbabwe , killing eight people . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On February 23 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began monitoring an area of convection in the Mozambique Channel . On February 25 , Météo France ( MF ) initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 13 when the system was located along the southwest coast of Madagascar . Later that day , the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert , noting that environmental conditions favored development , including weak wind shear . The system developed organized convection in a circular pattern , and on February 26 , the MF and JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 13 and Tropical Cyclone 19S , respectively . With a mid @-@ level ridge to the south , the depression moved generally westward , and after intensifying further , it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Japhet by the Direction de la <unk> et de l <unk> of Madagascar late on February 26 . 
 After attaining tropical storm status , Japhet quickly intensified while it began moving to the southwest , due to a break in the ridge . At 0000 UTC on February 28 , the MF assessed that the storm strengthened into a tropical cyclone – a storm with 10 minute sustained winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . This was about 12 hours after the JTWC upgraded Japhet to the same intensity but with 1 minute sustained winds . About 18 hours after designating Japhet as a tropical cyclone , MF estimated the storm attained 10 minute sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 103 mph ) and upgraded the storm to an intense tropical cyclone ; this made Japhet only the sixth such cyclone in the Mozambique Channel in 24 years . After further intensification , the cyclone peaked in intensity on March 1 . The JTWC estimated 1 minute sustained winds of 215 km / h ( 134 mph ) with gusts to 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) , while MF estimated 10 minute sustained winds of 175 km / h ( 109 mph ) . 
 Cyclone Japhet maintained its peak winds for about 24 hours , during which it remained nearly stationary . Subsequently , the storm began a northwest track toward the Mozambique coast , gradually weakening due to decreased outflow and dry air . At about 1700 UTC on March 2 , Japhet made landfall just south of Vilankulo , Mozambique , with winds of 160 km / h ( 99 mph ) as estimated by the JTWC . The cyclone gradually weakened over land , decreasing below tropical cyclone status by early on March 3 . Japhet crossed into southern Zimbabwe , and both JTWC and MF discontinued warnings before Japhet dissipated on March 5 . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 While Japhet was developing , the pressure gradient between it and a ridge produced winds of 93 km / h ( 58 mph ) on Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel . Heavy rains affected southwestern Madagascar , but there was no major damage . 
 Before Japhet struck Mozambique , the local Red Cross office mobilized volunteers , including 100 people in Inhambane Province who assisted local officials in preparations . The cyclone affected the same region that Cyclone Delfina struck two months prior . Japhet produced high winds and heavy rainfall in southern and central Mozambique into southern Zimbabwe . The rains were beneficial in alleviating drought conditions , and dry grounds absorbed much of the excess rainfall . After entering Zimbabwe , Japhet 's rainfall caused the Save River to rise , causing flooding in southern Mozambique several days after the storm passed the area . The resulting floods affected 50 @,@ 000 people in several villages . The Limpopo River also rose to above @-@ normal level . High rains also caused some crop damage , destroying 237 @,@ 000 hectares ( 585 @,@ 600 acres ) of crop fields . This included 12 @,@ 325 downed cashew trees , 6 @,@ 955 wrecked banana plants , and 2 @,@ 495 killed livestock , all in Vilankulo ; however , the rains allowed farming conditions to improve due to wetter conditions in drought areas . 
 Before Japhet moved ashore , Vilankulo reported sustained winds of 74 km / h ( 46 mph ) , with gusts to 105 km / h ( 65 mph ) . There , the winds destroyed the roofs or damaged the doors and windows of 95 % of brick houses . In Inhambane Province in southern Mozambique , the cyclone destroyed several boats , cut power lines , and disrupted roads with flooding or downed trees , which prevented communication with the province . The storm destroyed 500 classrooms , 35 government buildings , and 7 health facilities . The cyclone damaged or destroyed 25 @,@ 000 houses in Inhambane and Sofala provinces , leaving about 23 @,@ 000 people homeless in Inhambane alone , which was the worst @-@ affected province . Three people were injured in <unk> by a fallen tree . There were 17 deaths in the country , which was less than from previous cyclones due to advance warning and coordinated government action . 
 The Zambia Meteorological Department warned of the potential of intense precipitation before Japhet moved into the region . In neighboring Zimbabwe , ten hours of high rainfall nearly overtopped the <unk> Dam and destroyed a bridge . The storm also damaged crops and destroyed houses in the country , killing eight people . 
 After the storm struck Mozambique , the World Food Programme distributed more than 4 @,@ 300 tons of food to affected citizens . The agency had to transport goods via helicopter due to damaged or flooded roads . The country 's primary north @-@ south highway , which was damaged by the storm , had emergency repairs and was reopened within three days . Mozambique 's National Disaster Management Institute distributed 70 tonnes ( 69 long tons ; 77 short tons ) of maize , 8 tonnes ( 7 @.@ 9 long tons ; 8 @.@ 8 short tons ) of beans , and 80 tents to storm victims . Lingering floods in Zimbabwe contributed to an increase in malaria cases . The Delta Corporation donated $ 6 million worth of blankets and food to residents in the country . 
 = Raiden ( Metal Gear ) = 
 Raiden ( Japanese : <unk> ) , real name Jack ( ジャック , Jakku ) , is a fictional character and protagonist from Konami 's Metal Gear series . Created by Hideo Kojima and designed by Yoji Shinkawa , Raiden was introduced in the series as the main player character of Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty . In Metal Gear Solid 2 , he appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit FOXHOUND , participating in his first mission . Despite coming across as rookie , he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian child soldier . Raiden reappears as a supporting character in Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots and returns as the main character of Metal Gear Rising : Revengeance dealing both with his past and his present life as a combatant . 
 The idea of creating Raiden originated from Hideo Kojima 's desire to view the Metal Gear series protagonist Solid Snake from a different point of view , inspired by the Sherlock Holmes stories . Raiden 's inclusion remained a secret to gamers before his debut ; despite some players ' reactions , the staff liked his character . Raiden 's debut role as the protagonist of Metal Gear Solid 2 became controversial for a reason : the unexpected substitution of the established hero Solid Snake . Some critics have defended the character , stating that fans were merely angered by the former 's removal and that the latter was appealing . Despite this mixed reception , Raiden has been highly praised for his role and Metal Gear Solid 4 redesign and even more for his role and design in Revengeance . 
 = = Character design = = 
 = = = Creation and appearance = = = 
 According to series creator Hideo Kojima , the decision to make a new character replace Solid Snake for most of Metal Gear Solid 2 stemmed from the developer 's desire to develop Snake from a third @-@ person perspective instead . Kojima also stated that Raiden 's character and its perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story . The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels in which the narrator was not the title character , but his friend Dr. Watson . Kojima affirmed that Snake was the game 's protagonist instead of Raiden . Yoshikazu <unk> , assistant director for the project , was uncertain about this decision ; he considered Raiden a " weak @-@ looking character " , but decided to follow Kojima . The codename " Raiden " was based on a historical combat aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service , the Mitsubishi <unk> Raiden . It was initially planned to be written in katakana as " <unk> " , but was changed to the kanji form " <unk> " because of the original resemblance to Bin Laden 's " Laden " in katakana , " <unk> " . The relationship between Raiden and Rosemary was inspired by Kojima 's own experiences ; their names , Jack and Rose , are a reference to characters in the film Titanic . Raiden in Metal Gear Solid 2 is considered to be a representation of the player through the experiences between the player and the character during the game . 
 Kojima received much fan mail ; one letter was from a girl who stated she did not want to play a game with an old man . He took this into consideration ; he and his team designed a character more appealing to women , resulting in Raiden 's appearance . Designer Yoji Shinkawa noted that he and the other character designers took a great deal of inspiration for Raiden 's appearance from the bishōnen archetype . Because Raiden was a new character the staff designed him carefully , giving him white hair to symbolize his introduction . Shinkawa further noted that Raiden ended up with an overall feminine appearance . His outfit ( the Skull Suit ) was difficult to design until the staff decided on a " <unk> " concept . Shinkawa wanted to make Raiden sexually appealing , emphasizing the tightness of his clothing . 
 Konami kept Raiden 's starring role in Metal Gear Solid 2 secret until the game 's North American release , going so far as to replace Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials . Although Raiden appeared in several preview trailers in his scuba gear , his presence was not emphasized . Raiden 's appearance in the game was announced to the Japanese press on the day of the game 's release in North America . 
 Kojima noted that fan response to Raiden 's character was both positive and negative . While accepting considerable negative feedback , Kojima and his team liked the character . In response to the positive reaction from Japan , the Raikov character was created for Metal Gear Solid 3 : Snake Eater as a parody of Raiden . While noting that Raiden would not be a playable character in Metal Gear Solid 4 Kojima confirmed his appearance in the game to website 1UP.com , stating that fans would like him by the end . For this title , Raiden 's new design was a response to the criticism that only his face remained in his cybernetic body . Shinkawa , himself , was surprised by the way he came to illustrate Raiden . The staff noted that Raiden 's debut in the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer received notably positive responses ; several video @-@ game magazines promoted the game with Raiden 's screenshots . Kojima echoed similar comments , indicating that he wanted to expand the character with another game . Raiden 's first fight against Vamp in the game caused difficulty to motion and voice actors because of carefully planned movements performed by the two fighters . The staff was nevertheless satisfied with the outcome , considering it one of the best battles in the game . 
 When Metal Gear Rising : Revengeance was known as Metal Gear Solid : Rising , former producer <unk> Matsuyama hinted that Raiden 's past as a child soldier would be elaborated and his weaknesses as a human would be explored . Matsuyama wanted Raiden to have as strong a role in the game as in Metal Gear Solid 2 , leading him to become the game 's main character . Director <unk> Kimura noted that he wanted Raiden to be able to move like he did in the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailers , wanting to show " the stealth of the sword , and the strength of not even losing to the gun , and the fear and power you have with this blade . " Matsuyama stated that they would focus on Raiden 's strong will and physical strength , so he would be enjoyable to control . Raiden 's design was changed during the game 's development , leading to different promotional images of him . Following the game 's reboot into a spin @-@ off , Developers stated that while Raiden " has grown up " in comparison to previous Metal Gear games , he is still conflicted with his life as a child soldier in a past civil war , leading him to be a " dark hero " . Shinkawa designed Raiden 's new body as a way to emphasize him being a dark hero contrasting his Metal Gear Solid 4 persona and later discussed with Platinum Games ' Kenji Saito about including his quasi @-@ human look . Raiden losing an eye also serves to represent his transformation across the story . In response to complaints regarding how Rising appeared to contradict Raiden 's ending in Guns of the Patriots , the Kojima Productions staff explained the game would explain what happened with Raiden 's life . 
 Raiden is first depicted as a white @-@ haired adult who uses a protective black @-@ and @-@ blue suit for his missions known as a " Skull Suit " ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) . In Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots Raiden has had his entire body below the upper jaw replaced with a prototype cybernetic body ; he has also had his blood replaced with a military substitute called " White Blood " ( <unk> , Shiro Chi ) , which requires regular maintenance . His original cybernetic body is replaced with a black one for Metal Gear Rising : Revengeance that also covers his left eye . Although proficient at all types of weaponry , Raiden specializes in wielding swords which resonate at high frequencies for the last fights in Sons of Liberty and during Guns of the Patriots and Revengeance . 
 = = = Personality and portrayal = = = 
 In his first appearances Raiden is a rookie agent who , as a result of training only in virtual reality , is inexperienced . However , he later reveals that he was feared as a child soldier — known as " Jack the Ripper " ( ジャック ・ ザ ・ <unk> , Jakku Za <unk> ) — who killed several enemies in a civil war and is ashamed of his past . This affects Raiden 's personality ; he begins to believe he is only useful in the battlefield and his relationship with his girlfriend , Rosemary , would not work . Manipulation by the Patriots causes him to believe he does not have free will . Raiden is encouraged by Solid Snake not to be concerned with what people tell him but to rely on himself to face his problems . 
 In the Japanese versions of the games Raiden has been voiced by <unk> Horiuchi , who felt he could understand the character 's pain ; despite becoming a cyborg , Raiden still acted like a human . Quinton Flynn was selected to voice Raiden in the series ' English adaptation by casting director Kris Zimmerman , who had previously worked with him . Flynn remembers having a long time to develop the character , being instructed by Zimmerman to use an older voice from a character he previously voiced . Flynn stated that Raiden was one of his favorite video @-@ game voice characters , and explained a notable difference between his roles in Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4 . 
 Kojima Productions have compared Raiden and Solid Snake as to their experiences and ways of thinking . During the game 's climax , Raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against Solidus Snake ; Snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow Revolver Ocelot , emphasizing Raiden 's lack of freedom . Hideo Kojima compared Raiden and Snake with movie monsters King Kong and Godzilla , respectively ; the former was taken from his home and his nature changed upon meeting Rosemary , whereas the latter will continue fighting against mankind 's menaces . Defeating Solidus , Raiden is encouraged by Snake to trust himself and believe in his own choices . This is further addressed by the staff 's motivation to make a new sequel to Metal Gear without Kojima . Kojima has also likened him with John Rambo from the Rambo series as both characters always find themselves taking part in battles despite their desire for a peaceful resolution .

 Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty introduces the player to Raiden in the Plant chapter ; he is introduced as a newly recruited , virtual reality @-@ trained member of FOXHOUND with no live combat experience before his current mission . Assisted via Codec by the Colonel ( his commanding officer ) and Rosemary ( his girlfriend ) , Raiden 's initial objective is to rescue several hostages from a terrorist group known as the Sons of Liberty . Raiden is helped by mercenary Solid Snake and spy Olga <unk> across his mission . As the story progresses , Jack is revealed as a former child soldier for the Sons of Liberty leader Solidus Snake during the Liberian Civil War . After the war 's end , Raiden was given a normal life and tried to forget his past . A clandestine organization known as The Patriots is revealed to be controlling his actions , however , with his commanding officer revealed as their computer @-@ generated AI , and one of their spies becomes Raiden 's girlfriend , and the two fall in love . Raiden defeats Solidus after being told by the Patriots ' AIs that his death would also trigger the deaths of Olga 's child and Rosemary , the latter of whom was revealed to have been pregnant with Raiden 's child during the mission . He later reunites with Rosemary , and both decide to stay together to raise their unborn child . 
 Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots ( set five years after Metal Gear Solid 2 ) features Raiden after rescuing Sunny ( the late Olga 's daughter ) from the Patriots , and searching for Big Boss 's corpse for Big Mama . The trauma of his breakup with Rosemary , coupled with the apparent miscarriage of his child , have made Raiden believe his only place is on the battlefield . Outfitted with a cybernetic exoskeleton as a result of the Patriots ' machinations , Raiden assists Solid Snake in the fight against Liquid Ocelot wanting to obtain the Patriots ' powers . After several encounters with Liquid 's men , Raiden stays in the ship Outer Haven to protect Snake as he shuts down the Patriots ' AIs . In an epilogue , Rosemary reveals to Raiden that their child was not miscarried ; her marriage to Roy Campbell was a hoax to protect her and their son from the Patriots . Upon hearing this news , Raiden reconciles with Rosemary . 
 Metal Gear Rising : Revengeance ( set four years after Metal Gear Solid 4 ) shows Raiden 's return as the main character . Raiden appears as a member of the private military company ( PMC ) Maverick Security in multiple tasks while raising money for his family . However , they are attacked by a group of terrorists called Desperado Enforcement LLC that kill his <unk> and leave Raiden near dead . Saved by Doktor , Raiden starts working with them to fight Desperado . His already vengeful obsession with Desperado becomes even more personal when he discovered , during a mission into Mexico , that Desperado and World Marshal Inc had been kidnapping several children , surgically removing their brains to place them into cybernetic bodies , and were planning to subject them to VR training modelled after his own training under Solidus during the Liberian Civil War . This results in Raiden abruptly resigning from Maverick to pursue and retrieving the children 's brain casings from World Marshal , having to battle his " Jack the Ripper " persona in the process . Although Raiden is successful in defeating Desperado he learns that Steven Armstrong was using such <unk> to distract Raiden as he attempts to create a new " War on Terror " . Raiden manages to stop Armstrong 's actions and decides not to return to Maverick , having his " own war to fight . " 
 = = = Other appearances = = = 
 Although Raiden does not appear in Metal Gear Solid 3 : Snake Eater , his character is the subject of parody throughout the game by debuting character Raikov . Raiden also appears in an early promotional trailer for Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots , fighting for control of the franchise with Solid Snake in a series of comic scenes . A sequel to the trailer was produced entitled " Metal Gear Raiden : Snake Eraser " in which Raiden travels to the past to assassinate Big Boss but fails comically . In the trailer 's English version , Raiden was voiced by Charlie Schlatter ( the voice actor for Raikov ) instead of Quinton Flynn . Raiden 's Metal Gear Solid 2 version appears in the Metal Gear Solid : Portable Ops Plus expansion pack , where he is an unlockable character . His Metal Gear Solid 4 incarnation appears as a playable character in Metal Gear Online .

His appearance in this game is modeled after his Metal Gear Rising design . 
 The Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty 2007 comic book adaptation by Alex Garner retells Raiden 's role in the series , with few changes made to the story . His relationship with Solidus is explored when he remembers his past ; when about to be killed by Solidus , Raiden is saved by Snake . The game 's novelization by Raymond Benson provides minor modifications to Raiden 's history , except for the moment he receives Olga 's sword , resulting in a change to his battle psyche .

 Raiden 's replacement of fan favorite Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid 2 proved controversial , and GamesRadar considered the event a reason to dislike the series overall . The same site criticized his role in Metal Gear Solid 2 several times , and called his inclusion one of the worst aspects of the game . In 2004 , GameAxis Unwired published a fake interview in which Hideo Kojima expressed regret for creating the character . While calling Metal Gear Solid 2 one of the biggest disappointments in video @-@ game history , UGO Networks ' Marissa Meli cited Raiden 's debut as a key problem with the game . Meli also commented on Raiden 's design , placing him 12th in a list of the most androgynous video game characters . The book Playing with Videogames states that Raiden 's inclusion was to surprise Metal Gear fans who , instead of playing as Snake , played as his opposite . Writer James Newman commented that fans ' reactions were highly negative , as though their expectations had been " betray [ ed ] " by Kojima . He compared Raiden to the controversial Star Wars character Jar Jar Binks . Trailers for Metal Gear Solid 3 : Snake Eater ( in which Raiden is mocked ) were considered by Newman to be Konami 's comic response to fans ' disapproval . Raiden proved to be more popular in Japan , with Yoji Shinkawa commenting it was because he matched the stereotype of manga hero . In 2012 , manga artist Hiro <unk> drew an illustration of Raiden in anticipation of the series ' following games . He mentioned having had difficulties illustrating the character . 
 Nevertheless , Eurogamer 's Tom Bramwell enjoyed Raiden 's role , commenting that his interactions with the other characters also helped expand Solid Snake 's character . His introduction was given an award for " Biggest Surprise " by GameSpot in 2001 , while Dave Meikleham from GamesRadar listed his appearance as one of the biggest plot twists in a video game since the trailers did not show him . Meikleham also called Raiden a " surprisingly likeable character " and found his dynamic with Solid Snake appealing . Before joining Kojima Productions Ryan Payton stated that he was not disappointed by Raiden 's introduction , and liked the fact that the Metal Gear Solid 2 team kept his identity a secret . Raiden 's English voice actor Quinton Flynn was surprised by fans ' response to the character , but commented that it also attracted new fans to the series . Regarding response about Raiden replacing Snake as the main character , Flynn thought that fans were angry at the idea that Raiden would replace Snake for all subsequent games . Raiden 's relationship with Rosemary was also listed as the most awkward part of the Metal Gear series by 1UP.com , with writer Scott Sharkey speculating about Hideo Kojima 's life since the director claimed the relationship was autobiographical . PLAY editor Nick Jones listed the scene in which Raiden is nude as his fourth most favorite moment of the franchise , calling it the " one of the funniest moments in gaming history . " Lisa Foiles of The Escapist included him on her 2014 list of top five katana wielders , noting " this is not a popularity contest and Raiden qualifies " even in MGS2 where " he was whiny , an emo , and kind of a bitch . " 
 Response to the character was mainly positive in subsequent games . His new design for Metal Gear Solid 4 was analyzed by GamePro 's <unk> Shaw , who commented that Raiden " was in one hell of a fight " . Raiden 's redesign has been praised for reducing his androgynous appearance , thus making him more appealing . UGO placed Raiden 's design in that game at 18th spot on its 2011 list of " the most stylin ' alternate costumes " , but Gavin Mackenzie from PLAY listed it seventh on his top list of inappropriate outfits , stating that the costume was " cool " but had unnecessary accessories . It has also been compared with Gray Fox 's cybernetic @-@ ninja design in Metal Gear Solid . Similarly , the GameSpot staff stated that Raiden " is definitely the inheritor of the quasi @-@ <unk> Cyborg Ninja inheritance " when he made his first appearance in a Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer . GameSpot applauded his actions in the trailer , calling it " wordlessly awesome " and comparing his stunts with those in the film <unk> : Robot Hunter . Writers from Cheat Code Central referred to his fight against Vamp in another trailer as the " undeniable highlight " that would make player wish to use Raiden in the game . Game Informer placed him on " The <unk> List " of the best characters of the 2000s in response to his new design since it made fans like the idea of a new Metal Gear game solely focused on his character . Raiden 's encounter with Vamp in this game was also labelled one of the " most memorable cinematics " of the series by GamePro because of Raiden 's change of fighting style from his debut as he " redeems his girlish image " , while IGN listed it as the 80th best moment in video @-@ game history for similar reasons . 
 IGN 's Jesse Schedeen listed Raiden as one of the " gaming icons " and most valuable players of 2009 , in response to his role in an upcoming Metal Gear title . Dave Meikleham of GamesRadar wrote an article entitled " Why Metal Gear Solid : Rising [ Metal Gear Rising : Revengeance ] will make you love Raiden " , explaining why fans who disliked the character would find his character and role appealing in the game . In a 2010 Famitsu readers ' poll , Raiden was voted the 42nd most popular video game character . In 2013 , Complex ranked Raiden as the 12th greatest soldier in video games , " even as he 's not as cool as Solid Snake , " while GamesRadar called Revengeance " perhaps the greatest cyborg ninja game of all time " and PLAY ranked Raiden as the second top ninja in games . 
 = = = Analysis = = = 
 Raiden 's role in Metal Gear Solid 2 has been analyzed by several writers , who emphasized how he is intended to represent the actual player . Early in the game , when Raiden 's virtual reality training is mentioned , the game shows scenes from the previous game Metal Gear Solid where the players took control of Solid Snake . Raiden 's interaction with veteran Solid Snake identify the former as " a Metal Gear fan " . As the game progresses it is stated that Raiden " has become Snake " , having developed skills similar to his from taking part in the Big Shell 's fights which resembled the Metal Gear Solid 's Shadow Moses Island . Later in the game , Raiden is told by a character to " Turn off the console " which confuses both the player and him . While this was first interpreted as a fourth wall @-@ breaking joke , the game 's climax goes deeper into Raiden 's connection with the player . When being forced by his superiors to kill the game 's antagonist , Solidus Snake , the player is told by the designers to finish the game . Both player and Raiden take different paths at the game 's end . The former is told not to waste time playing games ; the latter 's character is expanded with his decision to move on with his life , rejecting his previous identity by discarding the dog tags the player wore in the beginning . 
 Upon the revelation of the character 's new design as a cyborg ninja , writers noted how Raiden distanced himself from his previous appearance that imitated Solid Snake . They also emphasized how Raiden becomes a different type of game hero with a new , direct fighting style . Since Raiden has become more powerful than Solid Snake in physical strength and weaponry to the point of exaggeration , writers have compared him favorably to other popular game heroes and find his actions still in @-@ character considering the fight scenes throughout the series . 
 = Trogloraptor = 
 Trogloraptor is a genus of large spiders found in the caves of southwestern Oregon . It is the sole genus in the family Trogloraptoridae , and includes only one species , Trogloraptor marchingtoni . These spiders are predominantly yellow @-@ brown in color with a maximum leg span of 3 in ( 7 @.@ 6 cm ) . They are remarkable for having hook @-@ like claws on the raptorial last segments of their legs . 
 Trogloraptor belongs to one of only three new spider families described since 1990 . The specific name is in honor of the amateur cave biologist and deputy sheriff Neil Marchington . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 The spiders were first collected in 2010 by Geo <unk> , Neil Marchington , Ron Davis and Daniel Snyder , cave conservationists from the Western Cave Conservancy . They were described in 2012 by a research team consisting of arachnologists Charles Griswold , Tracy Audisio and Joel Ledford of the California Academy of Sciences . The male holotype was recovered from the M2 cave near Grants Pass , Oregon on July 29 , 2010 . The female holotype was recovered from a cave in Josephine County , Oregon on September 16 , 2010 . 
 Lead researcher Griswold claimed that Trogloraptor might explain the legends of giant cave spiders in the area . The discovery is also notable because only two other new spider families have been described since 1990 . The American arachnologist Norman Platnick commented that it was " ... as fascinating to arachnologists as the discovery of a new dinosaur is to paleontologists . " 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Trogloraptor includes only one species , Trogloraptor marchingtoni , and is the only genus in the monotypic family Trogloraptoridae . It was initially suggested that Trogloraptor was a primitive member of the six @-@ eyed spider superfamily <unk> . However , Trogloraptor exhibits several unique features , including primitive respiratory systems , that justify its assignment to a separate family . The family probably diverged from other spiders about 130 million years ago , which would make it another notable relict taxon from North America . A 2014 study based on ribosomal DNA found that Trogloraptor fell outside the <unk> and concluded that it should not be included in this clade . 
 The specific name is in honor of Neil Marchington . The generic name Trogloraptor means " cave robber " , in reference to the spider 's habitat and hooked raptorial tarsi . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Additional live specimens recovered in 2010 and 2011 from Oregon were all found deep inside caves . Except for a single juvenile specimen recovered from the understory debris of old growth redwood forests of northwest California , none have been found outside the caves . This specimen has different markings than T. marchingtoni and may represent a new undescribed species . 
 The family Trogloraptoridae may have had a wider distribution given that redwood forests encompassed a far greater area in North America during the Pliocene ( about 5 mya ) . Other species may still be present in other caves . 
 = = Description = = 
 Adult Trogloraptor have six eyes and a body length of about 7 to 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 28 to 0 @.@ 39 in ) in males and 8 to 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 to 0 @.@ 39 in ) in females . With its legs outstretched , the spider can reach up to 3 in ( 7 @.@ 6 cm ) in length . 
 The entire body is yellow @-@ brown , except for a dark brown V @-@ shaped mark on the cephalothorax , the orange @-@ brown chelicerae , and the purple @-@ brown abdomen ( opisthosoma ) with a series of faint light @-@ colored chevron markings . The cephalothorax carapace is pear @-@ shaped with a heart @-@ shaped sternum . The abdomen is oval and sparsely covered with small bristles ( setae ) . The males possess enlarged piriform pedipalps . 
 The spiders are unique in the flexible and <unk> hook @-@ like claws on the last segments ( tarsus ) of their legs . These elongated claws resemble those of spiders in the family <unk> of Australia and New Zealand , but the two families are only distantly related . Hooked tarsal claws are also present to a lesser extent in the unrelated genera <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of <unk> . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Trogloraptor spin simple webs with only a few strands , hung from the roofs of caves . Griswold et al. stated that the claws may have a significant function in capturing prey . Similar to the Nelson cave spider of New Zealand ( <unk> <unk> , a <unk> ) , Trogloraptor probably dangle upside down from their webs , snatching at passing flying insects with their claws . However their exact prey remains unknown . Captured live specimens were raised in climate @-@ controlled laboratory conditions in an effort to find out . These specimens were offered moths , crickets and other spiders as food ; but these were declined and the specimens starved after two weeks . This may indicate a preference for very specific prey . 
 Like most spiders , Trogloraptor possess venom glands . However , the venom is not known to be harmful to humans . The spiders themselves are very shy and unaggressive . They immediately flee illumination . 
 = The Martian ( film ) = 
 The Martian is a 2015 American science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon , based on Andy Weir 's 2011 novel The Martian . Damon stars as an astronaut who is mistakenly presumed dead and left behind on Mars . The film depicts his struggle to survive and others ' efforts to rescue him . The film 's ensemble cast also features Jessica Chastain , Kristen Wiig , Jeff Daniels , Michael Peña , Kate Mara , Sean Bean , Sebastian Stan , Aksel Hennie , Donald Glover , and Chiwetel Ejiofor . 
 Producer Simon Kinberg began developing the film after 20th Century Fox optioned the novel in March 2013 , which Drew Goddard adapted into a screenplay and was initially attached to direct , but the film did not move forward . Scott replaced Goddard , and with Damon in place as the main character , production was approved . Filming began in November 2014 and lasted approximately 70 days . Some 20 sets were built on a sound stage in Budapest , Hungary , one of the largest in the world . Wadi Rum in Jordan was also used as a practical backdrop for filming . 
 The film premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival on September 11 , 2015 , followed by the United States ' theatrical release on October 2 , 2015 by 20th Century Fox . The film was released in 2D , 3D , IMAX 3D and 4DX . The film received positive reviews and has grossed over $ 630 million worldwide , becoming Scott 's highest @-@ grossing film to date , as well as the tenth @-@ highest @-@ grossing film of 2015 . It received several accolades , including the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy , and seven Academy Award nominations , including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay for Goddard . Damon won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and was nominated for several awards including the Academy Award for Best Actor , the BAFTA for Best Actor , and the Critic 's Choice Award for Best Actor . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 2035 , the crew of the Ares III manned mission to Mars is exploring the <unk> Planitia on Martian solar day ( sol ) 18 of their 31 @-@ sol expedition . An unexpectedly strong dust storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle ( MAV ) , forcing them to hastily leave the planet . During the evacuation , astronaut Mark Watney is struck by debris and lost in the storm ; the last telemetry from his suit indicates no signs of life . With Watney believed dead , mission commander Melissa Lewis orders the remaining crew to return to their orbiting vessel Hermes without him . 
 Watney awakens after the storm to a low oxygen warning , in pain , and makes his way to the " Hab , " or " habitat , " the crew 's base of operations . He removes a piece of antenna from his suit 's <unk> — which caused the erroneous life @-@ sign readings — and his own torso , stapling himself up . He begins a video diary and realizes that his only chance of rescue is the arrival of the Ares IV crew at the Schiaparelli crater , 3 @,@ 200 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 000 mi ) away , in four years . Calculating that he has enough food to last only 300 <unk> ( roughly 309 days ) , Watney , a botanist , improvises a farm with Martian soil fertilized with human waste , water produced by extracting hydrogen from leftover rocket fuel , and potatoes saved for a Thanksgiving meal . He begins to modify the only functional rover to make long journeys across Mars to reach the rescue spot . 
 Reviewing satellite photos of Mars , mission director Vincent Kapoor and satellite planner Mindy Park see evidence of Watney 's activities and realize that he has survived . Despite the objections of Hermes flight director Mitch Henderson , NASA administrator Teddy Sanders decides not to inform the Ares III crew , believing it would distract them from their mission . 
 Watney takes the rover to retrieve the Pathfinder probe , which fell silent in 1997 . Using the lander 's camera , he establishes rudimentary communication with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) team using the hexadecimal system . NASA instructs Watney to modify the rover to link with Pathfinder so they can communicate via text . Watney becomes angry when he learns that the crew has not been told of his survival , and Sanders authorizes Henderson to inform them . 
 Henderson and JPL director Bruce Ng formulate a plan to send a space probe to Mars and resupply Watney with enough food to survive until Ares IV 's arrival . When the Hab 's airlock malfunctions and explosively decompresses , destroying Watney 's crop , Sanders orders the team to speed up the supply mission by skipping the safety inspections . As a result , the supply probe explodes shortly after liftoff . 
 The China National Space Administration offers NASA the " Tai yang Shen , " a classified booster that can carry a payload to Mars . Meanwhile , JPL <unk> Rich Purnell devises a trajectory to send Hermes back to Mars more quickly , using the Chinese booster to instead resupply it for an additional eighteen months . Sanders rejects the plan , refusing to risk the crew , but Henderson surreptitiously sends the details to Hermes . Lewis and her crew vote unanimously to execute the plan , and NASA — powerless to stop them — proceeds with the resupply as Hermes flies by Earth , using its gravity to slingshot them back to Mars . 
 After 461 <unk> , Watney begins the 90 sol journey to Schiaparelli , where the MAV for the Ares IV mission has been prepositioned . To rendezvous with Hermes , Watney makes drastic modifications to reduce the MAV 's mass , removing equipment including the windows , nose cone , and exterior panels . With Watney on board the gutted MAV , the Hermes crew launches it remotely , but it does not reach the planned speed and altitude . Lewis has Hermes use its maneuvering thrusters to change course and explosive decompression of its own internal atmosphere to adjust its speed . When even that is not enough , Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit to approach Watney 's vessel , but still cannot reach him . Watney pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air as a miniature thruster to reach Lewis . The crew is reunited as crowds around the world cheer the news . 
 After returning to Earth , Watney becomes a survival instructor for new astronaut candidates . Five years later , on the occasion of the Ares V mission launch , those involved in Watney 's rescue have begun new lives .

He explained , " For me the rehearsal process was sitting with Ridley and going kind of line @-@ by @-@ line and moment @-@ by @-@ moment through the script and playing out a plan of attack for what we wanted each scene to accomplish . " Chastain prepared for her role by meeting with astronauts and scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center . She was inspired by astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson , saying " She 's very matter of fact , very straightforward . My character is dealing with the guilt of leaving a crew member behind , but she 's still responsible for the lives of five other crew mates . I tried to play her as Tracy would have been in those moments . " 
 The Media Action Network for Asian @-@ Americans ( MANAA ) criticized the casting of white actor Mackenzie Davis as Mindy Park , who , it claimed , was described by author Andy Weir to be Korean @-@ American . The group also criticized the casting of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor , who , the MANAA claimed , Weir described as an Asian @-@ Indian character . In the novel , the character 's name was Venkat Kapoor , and he identifies religiously as a Hindu . The group called the casting whitewashing and said that Asian actors , being under @-@ represented in Hollywood , were deprived of acting opportunities . Weir said in October 2015 he perceived Mindy Park as Korean but said he did not explicitly write her as Korean . He also dismissed criticism of Ejiofor 's casting as Kapoor , " He 's an American .

 The Martian was directed by Scott and based on a screenplay by Drew Goddard that was adapted from Weir 's 2011 novel of same name . 20th Century Fox optioned the novel in March 2013 , and producer Simon Kinberg was attached to develop the novel into a film . The following May , Goddard entered negotiations with the studio to write and direct The Martian . Goddard wrote a screenplay for the film , and Matt Damon expressed interest in starring under Goddard 's direction . Goddard then pursued an opportunity to direct Sinister Six , a comic book film about a team of supervillains . Kinberg then brought the book to Scott 's attention . In May 2014 , Scott entered negotiations with the studio to direct the film with Damon cast as the film 's stranded astronaut . Scott said he was attracted by the emphasis on science and thought a balance could be struck between entertainment and learning . Damon said he was attracted by the novel , the screenplay and the opportunity to work with Scott . Following Scott 's commitment , the project picked up the pace and was quickly approved . Goddard has since expressed that he felt Scott made a much better film than he could have directed , telling Creative Screenwriting , " When it 's Scott , collaboration is easy because I just revere him . Every day I would just look around and think , ' Is that really Ridley Scott sitting there at the table ? This is exciting ! ' "

 Korda Studios ( in Hungarian : Korda <unk> ) 26 kilometres ( 16 mi ) west of Budapest , Hungary in the wine @-@ making village of <unk> was chosen for filming interior scenes of The Martian . It was favored for having one of the largest sound stages in the world . Filming began in Hungary on November 24 , 2014 . Scott chose to film The Martian with 3D cameras . Around 20 sets were constructed for the film ( where 70 were built for Scott 's Exodus : Gods and Kings ( 2014 ) and over 100 for American Gangster ( 2007 ) ) . Actual potatoes were grown in a sound stage next to the one used for filming . They were planted at different times so that different stages of growth could be shown in film scenes . A team of six people built 15 suits for the film . A practical backdrop for Mars was filmed in Wadi Rum , which is a UNESCO world heritage site located in Jordan . Wadi Rum had been used as a location for other films set on Mars , including Mission to Mars ( 2000 ) , Red Planet ( 2000 ) , and The Last Days on Mars ( 2013 ) . Filming lasted approximately 70 days . A special Mars rover model was built for the filming ; the movie cast and team presented the rover model to Jordan in return for the hospitality they had received . The rover is now exhibited in Jordan 's Royal Automobile Museum . 
 Weir avoided writing Watney as lonely and depressed in his novel . While Watney 's humor is preserved in the film , Scott also depicted the character 's isolation in the vast , dusty Martian landscape . Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote : " The scenes back on Earth provide a hectic , densely populated counterweight to the Martian aridity , which is magnificently represented by exteriors shot in the vicinity of Wadi Rum in Jordan . " Damon said he and Scott were inspired by the 2003 documentary film Touching the Void , which featured trapped mountain climbers . Scott also expected to film Watney as a Robinson Crusoe , a character in full isolation , but learned to film Watney differently since the character would be self @-@ monitoring his behavior under the watch of various mission cameras . 
 According to Scott , first cut of the movie was 2 hours and 45 minutes long . An extended cut of the movie was released on home video .

 When the novel was first published , NASA invited Weir to tour the Johnson Space Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory . When Scott began preparing the film , Weir contacted NASA to collaborate on the film . When Scott and producer Mark <unk> had their first production meeting , they called NASA and spoke with its film and television liaison Bert Ulrich . NASA decided to assist the filmmakers with depicting the science and technology in The Martian since it saw potential in promoting space exploration . Key NASA staff members that joined the partnership were James L. Green , the Director of the Planetary Science Division , and Dave Lavery , the Program Executive for Solar System Exploration . Scott conversed with Green twice before filming started . Over a period of a month , NASA answered hundreds of questions — on a weekly basis — on everything from radioisotope systems to the look of potential " <unk> " — the residences for future Mars astronauts . The questions were answered by Green or passed on to the right expert , and then came back to Scott 's team to make their way into the production . The space agency also sent hundreds of files of real images of Mars and images of control centers , down to what the computer screens look like , to the production team . Green arranged a tour of the Johnson Space Center in Houston for production designer Arthur Max , who met with individual specialists , taking hundreds of photos as he went for eight hours . The production designers created a futuristic , heavily modernized Mission Control as a studio set ; Ars Technica described its depiction as " the space agency that we all dream of " and the opposite of the real Johnson Center 's appearance as " a run down college campus " . 
 Newsweek said NASA collaborated more with The Martian than most other films : " Staff from many NASA departments consulted on the film , from script development through principal photography , and are now helping with marketing timed to the theatrical release . " As part of the collaboration , the production 's NASA liaison included the front page of the script for the film in the payload of the spacecraft Orion during its Exploration Flight Test 1 on December 5 , 2014 . 
 The Los Angeles Times said NASA and the wider scientific community anticipated the film as a way to publicize a human mission to Mars . The New York Times reports that the film " serves as a nice plug for NASA , which has returned the favor by pushing the movie on its website . ( On Monday [ September 28 , 2015 ] , scientists announced that signs of liquid water could be seen in photographs taken on Mars by a camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , timing that suggests NASA certainly has the whole cross @-@ promotion thing down . ) " . Jim Erickson , NASA project manager , said the film would show moviegoers " the risks and rewards " of humans traveling to Mars . 
 In October 2015 , NASA presented a new web tool to follow Watney 's trek across Mars , and details of NASA 's next steps , as well as a health hazards report , for a real @-@ world human journey to Mars .

 A running gag in the film is mission commander Melissa Lewis 's love for 1970s songs ( especially of the disco genre ) , which are the only music available to Watney on Mars and often appear as diegetic music . Non @-@ original songs featured in the film include : 
 " Turn the Beat Around " by Vicki Sue Robinson

 20th Century Fox launched a viral marketing campaign for The Martian . On June 7 , 2015 , NASA astronaut Michael J. Massimino shared an in @-@ universe video diary depicting Damon 's character and the other crew members . Ars Technica compared the video diary to similar viral videos marketed for Scott 's 2012 film Prometheus in having a similar " style of slickly produced fictional promotional material " . The studio then released an official trailer on June 8 . Forbes said , " 20th Century Fox has cut together a pretty perfect trailer in that it absolutely makes the sale . It establishes the stakes , offers a sympathetic lead character , shows off an all @-@ star cast , tosses out a potential catchphrase , and ends on a grimly humorous tagline . " In response to the trailer , Jimmy Kimmel , host of the late @-@ night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live ! , released a spoof trailer , The <unk> : Emission to Mars , that edited the original to parody the film . 
 At the start of August , Fox released another video , depicting interviews with each of the main crew members . Mid @-@ month , the studio released another film trailer , and NASA hosted a " Martian Day " at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to both promote The Martian and highlight the space program 's ongoing efforts to carry out a human mission to Mars . At the end of August , Fox released another video , presenting it as a special episode of the TV show <unk> in which astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson discusses the hazards of traveling to Mars . In September , Scott 's RSA Films released a teaser for The Martian that depicted Damon wearing Under Armour sports clothing and being active in his off @-@ world tasks . The teaser originated from a collaboration between RSA Films and the marketing shop 3AM ( under theatrical advertising agency Wild Card ) , initiated in 2014 , to produce advertising content for The Martian . RSA contacted the advertising agency Droga5 , under whom Under Armour is a client . Droga5 ultimately collaborated with <unk> and 3AM to produce the teaser . 
 Forbes 's Peter <unk> said American astronauts had traditionally been used by public relations to promote commercial products , starting with the drink Tang . <unk> said it " came as no surprise " that NASA astronauts in the International Space Station were reported by The Guardian and CBS News as having read Weir 's novel and hoping to see the film on board the ISS . NASA participated in the marketing of the film despite its lack of involvement with previous films . Though it turned down a request for Interstellar to be screened on the ISS , The Martian was screened on board 402 km ( 250 miles ) above the Earth 's surface on September 19 , 2015 , and also at the Johnson Space Center in Houston , and at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral on October 1 , 2015 . 
 In November 2015 , 20th Century Fox announced The Martian VR Experience , a " virtual reality adventure " where viewers play as Mark Watney and reenact scenes from the film . The project was executively produced by Scott and directed by Robert Stromberg . It is scheduled to be released by the end of 2016 on HTC Vive , Oculus Rift , and Samsung Gear VR .

 The Martian received critical acclaim upon release . Critics commended the visual effects , the scientific accuracy , and the film 's likability , largely due to Matt Damon 's performance . The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , which categorizes reviews as positive or negative , surveyed 290 critics and determined that 92 % of the reviews were positive with a rating average of 7 @.@ 9 out of 10 , and the consensus " Smart , thrilling , and surprisingly funny , The Martian offers a faithful adaptation of the bestselling book that brings out the best in leading man Matt Damon and director Ridley Scott . " The site further stated that critics observed that Scott " <unk> [ ed ] more hopeful territory " than in his past films , and " the result is an awe @-@ inspiring adventure that explores vast ideas while staying grounded in very human emotional territory . " Metacritic also surveyed 46 critics and assessed 40 reviews as positive and six as mixed , assigning an aggregate score of 80 out of 100 , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . CinemaScore polled sample audiences , who gave the film an average grade of " A " on an A + to F scale . Audience demographics were 54 % men and 59 % over 35 . 
 Variety reported , " Critics are calling the film a funny , thrilling ride , and a return to form for [ Ridley ] Scott after The Counselor and Exodus : Gods and Kings fell flat . " According to Robert <unk> , commenting in The Guardian , " [ the film ] is the first genuine Mars movie . It is the first movie that attempts to be realistic and that is actually about human beings grappling with the problems of exploring Mars , as opposed to various movies set on Mars that are essentially either shoot ’ em ups or horror films . It does not engage in fantasy : no monsters , no magic , no Nazis . However , there are a number of technical mistakes . " 
 Writing for the New York Post , Lou Lumenick considered the film to be Scott 's and Damon 's best and thought that it is a " straightforward and thrilling survival @-@ and @-@ rescue adventure , without the metaphysical and emotional trappings of Interstellar . " Manohla Dargis , of The New York Times , stated that the film , " involves a dual journey into outer and inner space , a trip that takes you into that immensity called the universe and deep into the equally vast landscape of a single consciousness . For this accidental castaway , space is the place where he ’ s physically marooned , but also where his mind is set free " , from a film director , whose " great , persistent theme is what it means to be human " . Another positive review came from Steve Pulaski of <unk> Magazine , who gave the film a B and stated , " Above all , this is a film destined to please a crowd ; in addition , it also keeps its pathos down considerably , doesn 't do a whole lot of pandering to a crowd anxious to see action , and never loses sight of its deeply human and remarkable story .

 = = Scientific accuracy = = 
 When Weir wrote the novel The Martian , he strove to present the science correctly and used reader feedback to get it right . When Scott began directing the film , he also sought to make it realistic and received help from James L. Green , the Director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA 's Science Mission Directorate . Green put together teams to answer scientific questions that Scott asked . Green said , " The Martian is reasonably realistic " , though he said the film 's hazardous dust storm , despite reaching speeds of 120 miles per hour ( 190 km / h ) would in reality have weak force . Green also found the NASA buildings in the film to be more stylish than the functional ones NASA actually uses . Film critics picked up the point that the Martian winds could amount to " barely a light breeze " in their reviews , and screenwriter Goddard agreed the winds had to be considerably exaggerated in order to set up the situation that sets the story in motion . 
 The process used by the character Watney to produce water was accurate and is being used by NASA for a planned Martian rover . The radioisotope thermoelectric generator was also appropriately used for heat . When his rations begin to run low , Watney builds an improvised garden using Martian soil and the crew 's feces as a fertilizer . " We could probably grow something on Mars " , said Michael Shara , curator , Department of Astrophysics , Division of Physical Sciences at the American Museum of Natural History . It is also thought possible that microbial organisms could potentially live on Mars . In one scene , the glass face shield on Watney 's helmet cracks ; as oxygen momentarily drops below the critical level , he quickly patches the helmet with tape and avoids suffocation . According to Shara , " As long as the pressure on the inside is around 30 percent , you could hold it together before your eyes blow out or you had an embolism . " 
 While Martian gravity is less than 40 % of Earth 's , director Scott chose not to depict the gravitational difference , finding the effort less worthwhile to put on screen than zero gravity . Scott said the heavy spacesuits would weigh the main character enough to make up for not showing the partial gravity . The climate of Mars is also cold enough that it would make Watney 's initial plan to disable the rover 's heater immediately impractical . The average temperature is − 80 ° F ( − 62 ° C ) ; it is cold enough on Mars for carbon dioxide snow to fall at the poles in winter . 
 Ed Finn , director of the Center for Science and the Imagination at Arizona State University , said , " What this story does really well is imagine a near @-@ future scenario that doesn 't push too far of where we are today technically . " British physicist Brian Cox said , " The Martian is the best advert for a career in engineering I 've ever seen . " 
 = Battle of Neerwinden ( 1793 ) = 
 The Battle of Neerwinden ( 18 March 1793 ) saw a Republican French army led by Charles François Dumouriez attack a Coalition army commanded by Prince Josias of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Saalfeld . The Coalition army 's Habsburg Austrians together with a small contingent of allied Dutch Republic troops repulsed all French assaults after bitter fighting and Dumouriez conceded defeat , withdrawing from the field . The French position in the Austrian Netherlands swiftly collapsed , ending the threat to the Dutch Republic and allowing Austria to regain control of her lost province . The War of the First Coalition engagement was fought at Neerwinden , located 57 kilometres ( 35 mi ) east of Brussels in present @-@ day Belgium . 
 After Dumouriez 's victory at Jemappes in November 1792 , the French armies rapidly overran most of the Austrian Netherlands . Rather than driving the Austrians to the west bank of the Rhine River , Dumouriez and the French government became preoccupied with a war with the Dutch Republic . During the breathing space offered by her enemy , Austria assembled an army under the Prince of Coburg and struck back . After a French covering force was routed by Coburg at <unk> , Dumouriez began gathering his army for a counterstroke . 
 Coburg took up a defensive position at Neerwinden and awaited the confident Dumouriez 's attack . The Coalition army was outnumbered in infantry but possessed a two @-@ to @-@ one superiority in cavalry . After intense fighting , Coburg 's troops repulsed the attacks of the French center and right wing . When Dumouriez found that his left wing was driven off the battlefield , he began retreating . The defeat led to mass desertions from the discouraged French volunteers . In the face of the military collapse , Dumouriez negotiated a free withdrawal of French troops in return for the surrender of Belgium and Dutch territory . Soon , Dumouriez was plotting against his own government and when his plans failed , he defected to the Austrians , leaving the French army in chaos .

 On 6 November 1792 , a French army under Charles François Dumouriez defeated the Austrian army of Duke Albert of Saxe @-@ Teschen at the Battle of Jemappes . The French enjoyed an enormous numerical superiority with 40 @,@ 000 infantry , 3 @,@ 000 cavalry and 100 guns against an Austrian army counting 11 @,@ 628 foot soldiers , 2 @,@ 168 horsemen and 56 guns . Within one month the French armies overran most of the Austrian Netherlands , a territory known today as the nation of Belgium . On the right flank , the Army of the Ardennes led by Jean @-@ Baptiste Cyrus de Valence advanced down the Meuse River toward Huy . On the way , Valence dropped off a force under Louis @-@ Auguste Juvénal des Ursins d <unk> to besiege Namur . Dumouriez himself with the Army of Belgium captured Liège . The Army of the North commanded by Francisco de Miranda laid siege to Antwerp . It was joined by a column under <unk> Guérin de Berneron that marched first from Ath northeast to Leuven ( Louvain ) . 
 Mechelen ( Malines ) capitulated to Henri Christian Michel de Stengel and 6 @,@ 000 Frenchmen on 16 November 1792 and its garrison of one battalion of the Austrian Württemberg Infantry Regiment Nr. 38 was allowed to go free . On the 27th Stengel with 8 @,@ 000 soldiers from the Army of Belgium won a minor action at <unk> @-@ lez @-@ <unk> near Liège over Anton Sztáray and four battalions of Austrians . Antwerp fell on 29 November to Miranda 's 17 @,@ 600 infantry and 1 @,@ 245 cavalry . The Austrian garrison of the 1st Battalion of the Hohenlohe Nr. 17 , two companies of the Vierset Nr. 59 and four companies of the Würzburg Infantry Regiments , plus 140 gunners surrendered after losing two dead and four wounded . The French captured 57 cannons , 50 additional 3 @-@ pound regimental cannons , 3 @,@ 150 muskets and 1 @,@ 523 hundredweight of gunpowder . The 2 @,@ 599 @-@ man garrison of Namur under Johann Dominik von <unk> surrendered on 2 December to Valence and Harville after a four @-@ week siege . The Austrian defenders included two battalions of the Kinsky Infantry Regiment Nr. 36 , one battalion of the Vierset , two companies of the Le Loup Jäger Battalion , a half @-@ squadron of the Esterhazy Hussar Regiment Nr. 32 and 90 gunners . Harville 's division counted 13 @,@ 256 infantry , 1 @,@ 425 cavalry and 266 artillerists .

 Dumouriez had an opportunity to drive the Austrians from the west bank of the Rhine in conjunction with the Army of the Center . Instead he pursued a pet project of his , the invasion of the Dutch Republic . He hoped to go to war with the Dutch while keeping the Kingdom of Great Britain neutral . But the French government forced his hand , declaring war on Great Britain on 1 February 1793 and ordering him to overrun the Dutch Republic . Dumouriez undertook the invasion with 15 @,@ 000 infantry and 1 @,@ 000 cavalry , soon reinforced . Leaving Miranda to besiege Maastricht , covered by Valence 's army and Harville 's corps , Dumouriez pushed north . At this time the Army of the North counted 18 @,@ 322 men , the Army of Belgium numbered 30 @,@ 197 , the Army of the Ardennes consisted of 23 @,@ 479 soldiers , Harville 's corps was 12 @,@ 051 strong , the Army of Holland had 23 @,@ 244 troops and there were 15 @,@ 000 men in Belgian garrisons . All told , the strength of the French army in the Low Countries was 122 @,@ 293 men . The French army became overconfident , believing itself invincible . Meanwhile , the National Convention was riven by bitter political struggles between the moderate <unk> and the extreme Jacobins . During this period the army supply system fell apart through neglect . 
 Dumouriez crossed the Dutch frontier on 16 February 1793 . The fortress of Breda fell after a quick siege from 21 to 24 February 1793 . The 3 @,@ 000 Dutch defenders , which included 2 @,@ 500 infantry and a dragoon regiment , surrendered the city with its 250 cannon and were allowed to go free . Also on the 21st , Maastricht was invested by 10 @,@ 000 troops of Miranda 's army . There were 8 @,@ 000 Austrian and Dutch defenders under Prince Karl Wilhelm Georg of Hesse @-@ Darmstadt , an Austrian General @-@ major . The siege work at Maastricht in winter weather was too much for the French volunteers and many deserted their units and went home . The fortress of Geertruidenberg with 150 guns capitulated after a siege from 1 to 4 March . The Dutch garrison of two battalions and two squadrons were allowed to go free . Both Breda and Geertruidenberg had been bluffed into giving up by the military engineer Jean Claude le Michaud d <unk> , who had designed the floating batteries at the Great Siege of Gibraltar . A small fort at <unk> was captured on 4 March by 4 @,@ 000 men under Berneron . The tiny garrison put up a stiff fight and lost 60 killed before the 73 survivors gave up . 
 Poised at the edge of Hollands Diep , Dumouriez planned to cross and march through Rotterdam , Delft , The Hague and Leiden to seize Amsterdam . After capturing Maastricht , Miranda would join him by advancing through Nijmegen and Utrecht . Preoccupied with the Dutch Republic , the French commander had given the Austrians too much time to recover . Prince Josias of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Saalfeld massed an Austrian army on the west bank of the Rhine . He was assisted by a promising staff officer named Karl Mack von <unk> . On 1 March , Coburg swept aside René Joseph de <unk> 's covering army at the Battle of <unk> . The French abandoned the siege of Maastricht on 3 March . Coburg pursued slowly and the French forces regrouped at Leuven on the 9th . Dumouriez was slow to give up his Dutch project but the French government insisted that he take charge in Belgium . Leaving Louis @-@ Charles de Flers in command of the Army of Holland , Dumouriez arrived at Leuven on 11 March . 
 Dumouriez thought his soldiers ' morale was too shaky for a retreat so he advanced on Coburg 's army , seeking battle . In his haste , the French commander failed to call up Harville 's corps or the Army of Holland as reinforcements . Earlier , François Joseph Drouot de Lamarche had been driven out of Tienen ( Tirlemont ) , but on 16 March the French recaptured it after a vigorous combat . The French attacked Tienen with 10 @,@ 000 troops while Archduke Charles , Duke of Teschen defended the town with 6 @,@ 000 soldiers , six guns and two mortars . French casualties numbered 500 while their opponents sustained losses of 800 killed , wounded and missing . Coburg pulled his army back behind the Little Gete River . Believing that he outnumbered his enemies , Dumouriez was very confident of success . A century before , the French had won the Battle of Landen on the same ground .

 Coburg 's Advance Guard under Archduke Charles was drawn up on the right flank , Graf Colloredo and the Duke of Württemberg stood in the center and the Count of Clerfayt with the Reserve defended the left flank . The village of Halle was at the far right of the line while Neerwinden village was in the left @-@ center . A screen of Coalition light troops was posted in all the hamlets along the Little Gete . Dumouriez organized eight columns of attack . Valence on the right led three attack columns against Racour and Oberwinden , the Duke of Chartres directed two columns in the center via <unk> and Miranda commanded three columns on the left along the main road to Halle . The French reserve formed a final column on the far left where it was to first capture Zoutleeuw ( <unk> ) and then swing south against Halle . Lamarche 's Advance Guard operated with the Right Wing . 
 Dumouriez believed that Coburg would put his main strength on the right wing to protect the Austrian line of communications . Therefore , he planned to throw his heaviest blow against Coburg 's left wing . Clerfayt 's line stretched from Neerwinden , across Mittelwinden hill to Oberwinden village on the left . Dumouriez directed Valence to outflank Oberwinden with one column , attack Oberwinden frontally with the second and seize the Mittelwinden hill with the third . On Valence 's left , Chartres was ordered to attack Neerwinden with his columns . At 7 : 00 AM , the French swarmed across the Little Gete but Valence was unable to capture the Mittelwinden hill until noon . The French seized Racour , Oberwinden and finally Neerwinden . 
 The Coalition forces launched attack after attack on the villages which were stubbornly defended by the French . Meanwhile , Austrian cavalry charges were highly effective in the open ground between the settlements . After bitter fighting in which Oberwinden and Racour changed hands repeatedly , the two villages and Neerwinden were recaptured by Clerfayt 's troops . An Austrian cavalry charge pressed back the French even farther . Dumouriez attempted one more all @-@ out attack with his right but it failed . The French cavalry covered the retreat of the infantry , with Chartres and Valence maintaining a position along the Little Gete . 
 When Miranda attacked that morning , Coburg 's first reaction was to draw substantial troops from his center to reinforce his right flank . Initially , Archduke Charles ' men were driven back to <unk> but then they held on to the village . The French Reserve captured <unk> and threatened Halle but was soon thrown back . The main fighting occurred between 3 : 00 and 6 : 00 PM when Miaczinski 's column seized <unk> but counterattacks drove his soldiers out . Other attacks withered in the face of the strong Coalition defenses . Charles saw an opportunity and hurled his cavalry on the tired French soldiers . The Left Wing became so demoralized that its troops were driven back to Tienen before Miranda could rally them . When Dumouriez heard of the defeat of Miranda 's wing on the morning of the 19th he was forced to order a retreat .

 On the Coalition side , Mack was given much of the credit for Coburg 's triumph . <unk> for the defeat , Miranda traveled to Paris to intrigue against Dumouriez . The Austro @-@ Dutch reported losses of 97 officers , 2 @,@ 762 rank and file and 779 horses . The French lost 4 @,@ 000 killed and wounded , plus 1 @,@ 000 men and 30 artillery pieces captured .

Immediately after the battle , about 6 @,@ 000 French volunteers deserted the colors and went home . Three days later , Dumouriez 's army only numbered about 20 @,@ 000 troops as the men deserted in hundreds . On 23 March there was a clash at <unk> where Coburg with 38 @,@ 000 soldiers defeated Dumouriez with 22 @,@ 000 . The Austrians sustained 900 casualties while inflicting 2 @,@ 000 on the French . 
 On 24 March the French army retreated through Brussels . Dumouriez began calling in his detachments such as Harville 's corps . At this point Dumouriez opened negotiations with the Austrians . He offered to evacuate Belgium if his armies were allowed an unmolested retreat . The terms were accepted and the French armies withdrew to camps behind the border . The Army of Holland was allowed to march through enemy lines and took position near Lille . The Army of the Ardennes was posted at <unk> , the Army of the North at <unk> @-@ Saint @-@ Amand , and the Army of Belgium at Condé @-@ sur @-@ l 'Escaut and Valenciennes . Geertruidenberg was evacuated on 2 April and Breda on 3 April . 
 Dumouriez was a monarchist at heart and he despaired when King Louis XVI went to the guillotine on 21 January 1793 . He found the political situation in Paris to be chaotic . He was appalled at the tendency of radicals to interfere with army commanders . Having already negotiated with the enemy , Dumouriez offered to treat and the Austrians sent Mack on 25 March . The French commander proposed to take the army and march on Paris . He would overthrow the National Convention , crush the Jacobins and restore the Constitution of 1791 . For their part , the Austrians pledged to halt their advance while he carried out his coup . But Dumouriez moved too slowly . On 1 April , four commissioners and the War Minister Pierre de Ruel , marquis de Beurnonville arrived at his headquarters to demand that the commander explain himself in Paris . They were seized and handed over to the Austrians . 
 Dumouriez tried to put the frontier fortresses in the hands of his adherents but failed . Miaczinski botched the attempted seizure of Lille and was later executed . Dumouriez believed that he could control the regular infantry and cavalry regiments . On the other hand , the volunteers and the artillery remained devoted to the National Convention . In one incident , Dumouriez was fired on and nearly arrested by Louis @-@ Nicolas Davout 's volunteer battalion . He then made the mistake of being seen with an Austrian escort and the gunners took the lead in refusing to obey him . Seeing that his plot had fallen apart , Dumouriez defected to the Austrians on 5 April 1793 . He was accompanied by the Duke of Chartres , Valence , several more generals and some cavalry . No longer bound by the previous agreement , Coburg prepared to invade France . 
 Hitherto the armies had been ruled and directed by officers . Now begins the Revolutionary nightmare . 
 Ironically , the treason and defection of Dumouriez gave the Jacobins full scope to take control of the armies . Before Neerwinden , the army obeyed its commanders . Afterward , the representatives on mission were given extraordinary powers over army commanders . The generals might pay with their lives for defeat , but the real authority lay with the political operatives . Meanwhile , the new War Minister sent his agents to spy on the generals . These men were quick to report any complaint against officers , which could result in disgrace or execution . Elements of this system stayed in force even after Maximilien Robespierre was overthrown and guillotined .
