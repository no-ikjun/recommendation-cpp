 Scottish witchcraft trials were notable for their use of pricking , in which a suspect 's skin was pieced with needles , pins and <unk> as it was believed that they would possess a Devil 's mark through which they could not feel pain . Professional prickers included John Kincaid and John Dick , whose actions helped set off the outbreak of witch @-@ hunting in 1661 – 62 , and whose exposure as frauds , and subsequent imprisonment , helped end the trials . Judicial torture was used in some high @-@ profile cases , like that of John Fine , one of the witches accused of plotting the death of the king in 1590 , whose feet were crushed in a shin press , known as the boots . However , these cases were relatively rare . Confessions , considered the best evidence for conviction , were more usually extracted by " waking " the witch , keeping the suspect sleep deprived . After about three days individuals tend to hallucinate , and this provided some exotic detail in witchcraft trials . In Scotland , convicted witches were usually strangled at the stake before having their bodies burned , although there are instances where they were burned alive . 
 = = Witch beliefs = = 
 The belief that witches could cure and cause harm was common among all social groups in early modern Scotland . In 1701 in Anstruther , Elizabeth Dick had been turned away from the local mill when begging . She cursed the mill and several witnesses testified that the grain in the mill turned red . Only when one of the people who had refused her help ran after her and gave her alms did she bless the mill and everything returned to normal . About half of accused witches had already gained a reputation for causing harm over a long period of time . The fact that only four per cent of recorded accused witches were involved in folk healing seems to indicate that healing was not seen as a major element of witchcraft . The Aberdeenshire trials of 1596 reveal that spells could be purchased from witches for success at fishing , to ensure a happy marriage , to prolong life and to affect the weather . Many accusations included gender and sexual fears . Margaret Bain , a midwife , it was claimed , could transfer the pains of childbirth to a woman 's husband and Helen Gray cast a spell on a man that gave him a permanent erection . Witches could also carry out divinations . These included by reading the marks on the shoulder blade of a slaughtered animal , measuring a person 's sleeve or waist to see if they were suffering from a fever , or being able to find answers based on which way a sieve suspended from scissors or shears swung , as Margaret Mungo was accused of doing before the kirk session of Dingwall in 1649 . 
 It has often been stated that Scottish witchcraft was particularly concerned with the demonic pact . In the high court , Katherine Sands , who was one of four women accused of witchcraft at Culross in 1675 , admitted to renouncing her baptism , receiving the Devil 's mark and having sex with the Devil , but in local trials these demonic elements were rarer . Stuart MacDonald notes that in trials from Fife the Devil was a relatively insignificant and indistinct figure and that a number of instances of covens meeting look like fairy revels , where the dancing fairies traditionally disappeared when a human broke the ring , rather than satanic gatherings . Fairies were an important part of magical beliefs in Scotland . Isobel <unk> , the young wife of a <unk> from near Auldearn , who was tried for witchcraft in 1662 , left four depositions , gained without torture , that provide one of the most detailed insights into magical beliefs in Britain . She stated that her coven met on nearby Downie Hill , that they could transform themselves into hares and that she had been entertained by the Queen of the Fairies in her home under the hill . J. A. MacCulloch argued that there was a " mingling of beliefs " in Scotland , between popular belief in fairies and elite Christian ideas of demonic action . 
 = = Decline = = 
 In the seventeenth century there was growing scepticism about the reality of witchcraft among the educated elite . Scotland was defeated in the Civil Wars by the forces of the English parliament led by Oliver Cromwell and occupied . In 1652 Scotland was declared part of a Commonwealth with England and Ireland and the Privy Council and courts ceased to exist . The English judges who replaced them were hostile to the use of torture and often sceptical of the evidence it produced , resulting in a decline in prosecutions . In an attempt to gain support among the landholding orders , Sheriff 's courts were re @-@ established and Justices of the Peace returned in 1656 . The result was a wave of witchcraft cases , with 102 in the period 1657 – 59 . The limitations on prosecutions were fully reversed with the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , and there was a flood of over 600 cases that alarmed the restored Privy Council , leading it to insist on the necessity of its commission for an arrest or prosecution , and banning judicial torture . 
 Prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government , torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised . The exposure of prickers as frauds in 1662 removed a major form of evidence . The Lord Advocate George Mackenzie made efforts to make prosecutions ineffective . There may also have been a growing popular scepticism , and , with relative peace and stability , the economic and social tensions that may have contributed to accusations were reduced , although there were occasional local outbreaks , like those in East Lothian in 1678 and in Paisley in 1697 . The last executions in the records of the central courts were in 1706 . The last trial was held in the court of a sheriff @-@ depute at Dornoch in 1727 , and was of questionable legality . The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736 , making the legal pursuit of witches impossible . Nevertheless , basic magical beliefs persisted , particularly in the Highlands and Islands . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Various reasons for the Scottish witch @-@ hunt , and its more intense nature than that in England , have been advanced by historians . Older theories , that there was a widespread pagan cult that was persecuted in this period and that the witch @-@ hunts were the result of a rising medical profession eliminating folk healers , have been discredited among professional historians . Most of the major periods of prosecution coincided with periods of intense economic distress , and some accusations may have followed the withdrawal of charity from marginal figures , particularly the single women that made up many of the accused . The reformed Kirk that emerged from 1560 was heavily influenced by Calvinism and Presbyterianism , and may have perceived women as more of a moral threat . As a result the witch @-@ hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women . Christina Larner suggested that the outbreak of the hunt in the mid @-@ sixteenth century was tied to the rise of a " godly state " , where the reformed Kirk was closely linked to an increasingly intrusive Scottish crown and legal system . 
 It has been suggested that the intensity of Scottish witch @-@ hunting was due to an inquisitorial judicial system and the widespread use of judicial torture . However , B. P. <unk> argues that the Scottish system was only partly inquisitorial and that use of judicial torture was extremely limited , similar to the situation in England . A relatively high level of acquittal in Scottish trials may have been due to the employment of defence lawyers in Scottish courts , a benefit not given accused witches in England . The close involvement of the Scottish Kirk in trials and the decentralised nature of Scottish courts , where local magistrates heard many cases ( in contrast to England where most were before a small number of circuit judges ) , may have contributed to higher rates of prosecution . The diabolic pact is often stated as a major difference between Scottish and English witchcraft cases , but Stuart Maxwell argues that the iconography of Satan may be an imposition of central government beliefs on local traditions , particularly those concerned with fairies , which were more persistent in Scotland than in England . The proliferation of partial explanations for the witch @-@ hunt has led some historians to proffer the concept of " associated circumstances " , rather than one single significant cause . 
 = Loboc Church = 
 The San Pedro Apostol Parish Church ( also Saint Peter the Apostle Parish Church , Spanish : Iglesia <unk> de San Pedro Apóstol ) , commonly known as Loboc Church , is a Roman Catholic church in the municipality of Loboc , Bohol , Philippines , within the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tagbilaran . 
 After the Jesuits established the Christian community in Baclayon , they moved to Loboc and established a second Christian settlement in Bohol . The parish was established in 1602 , and the present coral stone church was completed in 1734 . Because of its strategic location , it became the center of the Jesuit mission in the Bohol area . In 1768 , upon the expulsion of the Jesuits , the town was transferred to the Augustinian Recollects . 
 The church is classified as a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines and a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines . It was considered for the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Philippines as a member of two categories , the Baroque Churches of the Philippines ( Extension ) and the Jesuit Churches of the Philippines . 
 It was severely damaged when a 7 @.@ 2 magnitude earthquake struck Bohol and other parts of Central Visayas on October 15 , 2013 . 
 = = Church history = = 
 After the establishment of the Jesuit mission in Bohol , Father Juan de Torres , SJ , moved to the community along the Loboc River in late 1596 to establish a second mission station . The first church , made of wood , was built by the people of the area on a site called Calvario , <unk> , near the location of the present @-@ day church . It was dedicated under the patronage of Saint Michael the Archangel . Loboc officially became a Catholic parish in 1602 . Due to pirate attacks on Baclayon and the strategic position of Loboc , the Jesuits chose Loboc to become the center of their mission . The Jesuit superior of Bohol later resided in Loboc until the Jesuits ' expulsion in 1768 . A boarding school for boys , the Seminario de los Indios , was established at Loboc in 1605 . 
 Fire destroyed the original wooden church in 1638 ; it was later reconstructed by the Jesuit priest Jose Sanchez . A larger church was built in 1670 , on the site of the present day convent . The present coral stone church was finished in 1734 . After the Jesuits were expelled from the country in May 1768 , the Augustinian Recollects assumed the administration of the parish and the church that November .

 In 1998 , Loboc Church was declared a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Institute , now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines . It was also listed as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines . 
 The church complex was a candidate for UNESCO World Heritage Sites of the Philippines , under two distinct categories . The Jesuit Churches of the Philippines nomination includes the churches of Maragondon in Cavite , Baclayon in Bohol and Guiuan in Eastern Samar . The Baroque Churches of the Philippines ( Extension ) nomination , nominates Loboc Church along with the churches of <unk> de Maria in <unk> , Cebu , La Inmaculada Concepcion in Guiuan , Eastern Samar , San Matias in <unk> , Isabela , and San Isidro Labrador in Lazi , Siquijor . However , due to its total destruction , it was removed from the roster of nominated sites . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The church is built along the banks of the Loboc River . The coral stone church follows a cruciform plan , with a sunken pyramidal roof on its crossing . As a church built by the Jesuits , exterior walls of the church have the Jesuit insignia and icons of an angel 's wing and head . Major renovations were undertaken by Augustinian priest Father Aquilino Bon , including the addition of a portico to the façade ( 1863 – 1866 ) and re @-@ roofing with tiles ( 1873 ) . Father José Sánchez , OAR , added stone buttresses to the walls ( 1891 – 1893 ) and side porticoes ( 1895 – 1896 ) . Because of frequent flooding , its wooden flooring was changed to cement tiles in 1895 and was elevated in 1969 . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The interior of the church is adorned with ceiling paintings by <unk> Avila and his sons , Ricardo and Ray Francia , created from May 1926 to July 1927 , and retouched by Cris <unk> in 1995 . A mural of Our Lady of Guadalupe , secondary patron of Loboc , painted by Max Aya @-@ ay in 1930 at the center of the nave depicts the Virgin saving Loboc from floods . The church also has a separate cantilevered organ loft , hosting a large pipe organ believed to be connected with Father Diego Cera , maker of the Las <unk> Bamboo organ . 
 = = = = Façade = = = = 
 The inner baroque façade , which is part of the 1734 church built by the Jesuits , is decorated with pilasters , capitals , blind niches and volutes . It is patterned after the San Ignacio Church in Intramuros , with two levels , a triangular pediment , and two narrow octagonal bell towers on each side . The neoclassical portico houses niches for Saint Peter and Saint Paul . Along the pediment is a wooden bas @-@ relief on galvanized iron of the papal tiara over crossed keys ( the symbol of Saint Peter ) on the center and medallions carrying the icons of the Augustinians and Saint Peter on both ends . 
 = = = = Altars = = = = 
 The church has five retablos ( reredos ) . The central retablo ( or retablo mayor ) at the altar houses images of Saint Peter , the patron , paired with Saint Paul on the uppermost niche . On the lowest level are images of Our Lady of Guadalupe , a secondary patron , in the center . Also on the lowest level were statues of Saint Lucy , patron against typhoons and Saint Francis Xavier , patron against floods and alligators . Both Saint Lucy and Saint Francis were elected patrons in 1697 . Behind the walls of the retablo mayor are the remains of the former Jesuit altarpiece , a bas @-@ relief of Saint Ignatius Loyola and St Francis Xavier dressed as a pilgrim .

 On the right side of the altar are two retablos . The larger altar on the right side currently houses the image of St. Francis Xavier as preacher on the topmost level . On the middle level of the same retablo are images of Saint Vincent Ferrer in the center , and Saint Augustine and Saint Monica on the left and right niches , respectively . The lowest level contains images of the Nuestra Señora de la <unk> in the center , Saint Anne to the right and Saint Thérèse of Lisieux ( originally St Joachim ) on the left . The smaller altar has two levels of baroque and neoclassical style , respectively , with images of the crucified Christ on the lower level and the Holy Infant on the upper . The tomb of Father Aquilino Bon and other Recollect priests who served Loboc are also on this side of the church . The remains of Jesuit priest Alonso de Humanes were formerly interred in this area before the transfer of his remains to San Ignacio in Intramuros . An apocryphal account tells of a fire in a former Loboc church stopping at the foot of Humanes ' tomb ; this story spread across the people of the Loboc and nearby towns , which drew pilgrims to light candles in memory of Humanes .

 On the left side of the altar are also two retablos .

The original images on the lowest level have been replaced . The smaller retablo , also of the same style , houses the images of Saint Joseph with the child Jesus , and St Isidore the Laborer on the lower and upper level , respectively .

 The convent , which was built around 1854 , was used as the central residence of Jesuit missionaries in Bohol . It was built parallel to the transept and was an unusual three @-@ storey structure , with a two @-@ storey outdoor gallery ( called a <unk> ) and thick walls . It is the only convent in the Philippines with three storeys . An extension perpendicular to the convent was built in the middle of the 19th century . The convent was also adorned with paintings on its walls and ceilings , and with colored glass on its windows and cornices on the kitchen . The roof was replaced with galvanized iron in 1888 . The third floor of the convent is now used as an ecclesiastical museum ( known as Loboc Museum ) , containing several religious artifacts , such as a 1786 silver missal and 18th century wooden Santo Niño .

 = Robert A. Little = 
 Robert Alexander Little , DSO & Bar , DSC & Bar ( 19 July 1895 – 27 May 1918 ) , a World War I fighter pilot , is generally regarded as the most successful Australian flying ace , with an official tally of forty @-@ seven victories . Born in Victoria , he travelled to England in 1915 and learned to fly at his own expense before joining the Royal Naval Air Service ( RNAS ) . Posted to the Western Front in June 1916 , he flew Sopwith Pups , Triplanes and Camels with No. 8 Squadron RNAS , achieving thirty @-@ eight victories within a year and earning the Distinguished Service Order and Bar , the Distinguished Service Cross and Bar , and the French Croix de Guerre . Rested in July 1917 , he volunteered to return to the front in March 1918 and scored a further nine victories with No. 3 Squadron RNAS ( later No. 203 Squadron RAF ) before he was killed in action on the night of 27 May , aged twenty @-@ two . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Little was born on 19 July 1895 at Hawthorn , a suburb of Melbourne , to Canadian James Little , a seller of medical and surgical books , and his Victorian @-@ born wife Susan . His family heritage was Scottish , and he was educated at Camberwell Grammar School and Scotch College , Melbourne , where he was a swimming medallist . He entered his father 's business as a travelling salesman , and was living with his family at Windsor when World War I broke out in August 1914 . 
 = = World War I = = 
 Long interested in aviation , Little decided to apply for pilot training at the Australian Army 's Central Flying School in Point Cook , but with only four vacancies , he was rejected along with hundreds of others . He then decided to sail for England in July 1915 and become a qualified pilot at his own expense . Gaining his flying certificate with the Royal Aero Club at Hendon in October , he joined the Royal Naval Air Service ( RNAS ) as a probationary flight sub @-@ lieutenant on 14 January 1916 . He suffered badly from air sickness early on , most likely brought on by fumes from castor oil that was employed as an engine lubricant in the aircraft he flew in England . 
 Little arrived in France in June 1916 for service with No. 1 ( Naval ) Wing at Dunkirk , where he initially flew Sopwith 1 ½ Strutters in bombing raids . He married Vera Gertrude Field at the Congregational Church , Dover , on 16 September . The next month he was posted to No. 8 Squadron RNAS ( " Naval Eight " ) flying Sopwith Pups on the Western Front , under fellow Australian Stanley Goble . Little scored his first aerial victory on 23 November , destroying an enemy two @-@ seater north @-@ east of La Bassée . By the following February , he had four victories to his credit and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross ( DSC ) for " conspicuous bravery in successfully attacking and bringing down hostile machines " . In one action on 4 December , Little and Goble " fought like mad " against a large formation of German fighters , each claiming a Halberstadt ; Little did not return to base with Goble and was thought lost , but had only landed near Allied lines to clear his jammed gun before taking off again to continue the fight . 
 On 24 April 1917 , Little engaged a DFW C.V , forcing it to land . He then followed the German aircraft down to claim it as captured and personally take its crew prisoner at gunpoint . The Australian flipped his own plane in a ditch after touching down , however , prompting the surrendering enemy pilot to suggest : " It looks as if I have brought you down , not you me , doesn 't it ? " Naval Eight 's conversion to the Sopwith Triplane in April saw Little begin to score heavily , eventually registering twenty @-@ four victories on the type to bring his total up to twenty @-@ eight by 10 July , including twin victories in a day on four occasions . He was the squadron 's top scorer with the Triplane , mostly in one particular airframe , <unk> , that he christened " <unk> " , which also became the nickname of his baby son . The unit then began flying Sopwith Camels , in which he scored a further ten kills in July to make fourteen all @-@ up for the month . When he subsequently rotated back to England for rest , he was ranked Flight Lieutenant and credited with a total of thirty @-@ eight victories , including fifteen destroyed or captured . A bar to his DSC had been gazetted on 29 June , for " exceptional daring and skill in aerial fighting on many occasions " , and he received the French Croix de Guerre on 11 July , becoming — along with fellow Australian RNAS ace Roderic ( Stan ) Dallas — one of the first three British Empire pilots to be so decorated . In August , he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order " for exceptional skill and daring " , followed by a bar to the decoration in September for " remarkable courage and boldness in attacking enemy machines " . He was mentioned in despatches on 11 December , and promoted to flight commander the following month . 
 Despite Little 's prowess in combat , as an aviator he was ordinary at best , enduring a number of crash @-@ landings . What gave him his edge as a fighter pilot was his keen eye , excellent marksmanship , and willingness to single @-@ handedly take on entire enemy formations and close in on his prey — down to twenty @-@ five yards on occasion — before opening fire . Fellow No. 8 Squadron member Reggie Soar recalled , " Although not a polished pilot , he was one of the most aggressive ... an outstanding shot with both revolver and rifle ... " , while ace Robert <unk> described Little as " not so much a leader as a brilliant lone hand ... Small in stature , with face set grimly , he seemed the epitome of <unk> " . His squadron nicknamed him " Rikki " , after the mongoose " Rikki @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> " , which <unk> cobras in the story of the same name by Rudyard Kipling . Many who knew him saw a sensitive side , however , Soar noting that in addition to his skill with guns , Little was " also a collector of wild flowers " , and his wife contending that his appearance in photographs belied his sense of humour . Squadron commander Raymond Collishaw , who would finish the war as the RNAS ' top @-@ scoring ace , summed up Little as " an outstanding character , bold , aggressive and courageous , yet he was gentle and kindly . A resolute and brave man . " 
 Following a period of rest in England , Little turned down a desk assignment and volunteered to return to action on the Western Front , joining Lieutenant Colonel Collishaw 's No. 3 Squadron RNAS in March 1918 . The unit evolved into No. 203 Squadron of the new Royal Air Force on 1 April , formed after the merger of the RNAS and the Royal Flying Corps . Now ranked captain , and again flying Sopwith Camels , Little gained a further nine successes , beginning with a Fokker Triplane on 1 April , and concluding with two kills in one day on 22 May , an Albatros and a DFW . During this stretch of victories , on 21 April 1918 , he was brought down unharmed by Friedrich <unk> . On 27 May , Little received reports of German Gotha bombers in the vicinity , and took off on a moonlit evening to intercept the raiders . As he closed with one of the bombers , his plane was caught in a searchlight beam and he was struck by a bullet that passed through both his thighs . He crash @-@ landed in a field near Nœux , and bled to death before he was discovered the following morning by a passing gendarme . Little 's skull and ankle had also been fractured in the impact ; his body was identified by his friend and fellow ace , Charles Dawson Booker . Collishaw launched an investigation but it was never established whether the single bullet that hit Little had come from a gunner in the Gotha or from the ground . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Little was buried in the village cemetery at Nœux , before his body was moved to Wavans British Cemetery in the Pas de Calais . Aged twenty @-@ two , he left a widow and a son ; in accordance with her husband 's wishes , Vera travelled back to Australia to raise the boy . Of Little 's forty @-@ seven confirmed victories , twenty were credited as destroyed , two as captured , and twenty @-@ five as " out of control " ; he was believed to be responsible for many others driven down or forced to land , which were not counted in his official total . As well as the eighth most successful Commonwealth ace of World War I , and the ranking RNAS ace , this score made him the most prolific Australian ace of all time , ahead of Stan Dallas with an official score of thirty @-@ nine , although modern research also credits Dallas with a tally numbering in the fifties . 
 The propeller blade from Little 's Sopwith Triplane was fitted with a clock in its hub by his fellow officers , who presented it to his widow ; she transported it back to Australia in three pieces and it later went on display at the Australian War Memorial , along with his awards and the wooden cross of his original burial place at Nœux . The Sopwith Pup he flew with No. 8 Squadron RNAS , <unk> , was rebuilt to flying standard and in October 1976 led a flypast to commemorate the squadron 's Diamond Jubilee , before going on permanent display at the Royal Air Force Museum , Hendon . One of the buildings of the Australian Defence Force Academy ( ADFA ) in Canberra , opened in 1986 , was named in Little 's honour . 
 = Winnebago War = 
 The Winnebago War was a brief conflict that took place in 1827 in the Upper Mississippi River region of the United States , primarily in what is now the state of Wisconsin . Not quite a war , the hostilities were limited to a few attacks on American civilians by a portion of the Winnebago ( or Ho @-@ Chunk ) Native American tribe . The Ho @-@ Chunks were reacting to a wave of lead miners trespassing on their lands , and to false rumors that the United States had sent two Ho @-@ Chunk prisoners to a rival tribe for execution . 
 Most Native Americans in the region decided against joining the uprising , and so the conflict ended after U.S. officials responded with a show of military force . Ho @-@ Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men who had participated in the violence , including Red Bird , who American officials believed to be the ringleader . Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial ; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President John Quincy Adams and released . 
 As a result of the war , the Ho @-@ Chunk tribe was compelled to cede the lead mining region to the United States . The Americans also increased their military presence on the frontier , building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts . The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together , and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward , a policy known as Indian removal . The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832 , which involved many of the same people and concerned similar issues . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the War of 1812 , the United States pursued a policy of trying to prevent wars among Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region . This was not strictly for humanitarian reasons : intertribal warfare made it more difficult for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West , a policy known as Indian removal , which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s . On August 19 , 1825 , U.S. officials finalized a multi @-@ tribal treaty at Prairie du Chien , which defined the boundaries of the region 's tribes . 
 By that time , however , white Americans had begun to trespass on Ho @-@ Chunk ( or Winnebago ) lands in large numbers , drawn by the promise of easy lead mining along the Fever ( later Galena ) River . Native Americans had mined this region for thousands of years , and exporting lead had become an important part of the Ho @-@ Chunk economy . Ho @-@ Chunks tried to drive away the trespassers , but they often suffered abuse at the hands of aggressive miners . Some U.S. officials , concerned that Ho @-@ Chunk mining would delay what they saw as the inevitable American possession of the mining region , worked " to dissuade the Indians from their mining plans " . 
 = = = Methode family murder = = = 
 In March 1826 , a French @-@ Canadian man named Methode , his Native American wife , and their children were gathering maple syrup in present @-@ day Iowa , about twelve miles north of Prairie du Chien , when they were murdered , apparently by a Ho @-@ Chunk raiding party that had been passing through . The murderers evidently had no specific grievance with the victims , who were targets of opportunity . Two Ho @-@ Chunk suspects were arrested by Prairie du Chien militiamen and taken to Fort Crawford . After they escaped , U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Willoughby Morgan seized two Ho @-@ Chunk hostages and demanded that the Ho @-@ Chunk tribe turn over the murderers . 
 On July 4 , 1826 , the Ho @-@ Chunks delivered six men to Morgan at Fort Crawford . In accordance with Ho @-@ Chunk custom , writes historian Martin Zanger , the six men were not all involved in the murders ; they were surrendered to appease American anger and deflect punishment away from the tribe as a whole . The Americans , however , wanted to punish those personally responsible for the killings . Colonel Morgan was unable to determine who was guilty , and so he detained all six and demanded that the Ho @-@ Chunk chiefs identify the killers . Colonel Josiah Snelling , commander of the 5th Infantry Regiment , reinforced the fort amid rumors that the Ho @-@ Chunks were going to attempt to free the prisoners . Eventually , two Ho @-@ Chunks , Wau @-@ koo @-@ kau ( or <unk> ) and Man @-@ ne @-@ tah @-@ peh @-@ keh ( or <unk> ) , were turned over to the Americans and indicted for the murders . 
 = = = Evacuation and rumors = = = 
 The rumored Ho @-@ Chunk attack on Fort Crawford never came , and so in October 1826 , Colonel Snelling moved the garrison to Fort Snelling , where he hoped to reduce hostilities between the Dakotas ( Sioux ) and the Ojibwes ( Chippewas ) . The two Ho @-@ Chunk prisoners were also moved to Fort Snelling . In May 1827 , after Dakotas attacked an Ojibwe party near Fort Snelling , Colonel Snelling arrested four of the Dakotas and turned them over to the Ojibwes , who killed them . This angered some Dakotas , who encouraged the Ho @-@ Chunks to help them strike at the Americans , falsely telling them that the Ho @-@ Chunks prisoners had also been turned over to the Ojibwes for execution . 
 The false story of the execution of the Ho @-@ Chunk prisoners , along with the incessant American trespassing , convinced some Ho @-@ Chunks to take up arms against the United States . The timing seemed right , since the evacuation of Fort Crawford appeared to be a sign of American weakness . Another grievance was the news that some Ho @-@ Chunk women had been sexually assaulted by American riverboat crews along the Mississippi River , although this story , like the one about the executions , may have been a false rumor . The Ho @-@ Chunks broke off diplomatic relations with the United States by not showing up for a scheduled treaty conference , and prepared for war . 
 = = Hostilities = = 
 In late June 1827 , a Ho @-@ Chunk leader named Red Bird , along with Wekau ( or Wa @-@ ni @-@ ga , The Sun ) and Chickhonsic ( or Chic @-@ hong @-@ sic , Little Buffalo ) , went to Prairie du Chien to seek revenge for what they believed were the executions of the Ho @-@ Chunk prisoners . Unable to locate their intended victim , they instead targeted the cabin of <unk> Gagnier , the son of an esteemed African @-@ American nurse and midwife named Aunt Mary Ann . Gagnier welcomed the three Ho @-@ Chunks into his home for a meal . What happened inside varies according to sources . According to one account , Red Bird shot and killed Gagnier , while Chickhonsic shot and killed Solomon <unk> , a hired man or friend of the family . Wekau tried to shoot Gagnier 's wife , but she wrestled his gun away before escaping with her young son . Wekau had to settle for stabbing and scalping Gagnier 's infant daughter , who survived the attack . Another account says that only Red Bird committed the murders . Red Bird and his companions returned with the three scalps to their village at Prairie La Crosse , where a celebration was held . 
 On June 30 , 1827 , the Prairie La Crosse Ho @-@ Chunks struck again . About 150 Ho @-@ Chunks , with a few Dakota allies , attacked two American keelboats on the Mississippi , near the mouth of the Bad Axe River . Two Americans were killed and four were wounded in the skirmish ; about seven Ho @-@ Chunks died in the attack or later from their wounds . According to historian Patrick Jung , " The attack , while relatively small , was significant because it was the first act of war committed against the United States by Indians in the region since the War of 1812 . " 
 In their nascent war against the Americans , the Prairie La Crosse Ho @-@ Chunks sought to recruit allies among the Dakotas , Potawatomis , and other Ho @-@ Chunk bands . Most leaders of these tribes , while sympathetic to Ho @-@ Chunk grievances , urged neutrality . Some Potawatomis participated by killing some American livestock , but Potawatomi leaders Billy Caldwell , Alexander Robinson , and <unk> rode among the Potawatomi settlements and urged people to stay out of the war ; they would do the same five years later during the Black Hawk War . Many Ho @-@ Chunks also distanced themselves from the actions of Red Bird and the Prairie La Crosse Ho @-@ Chunks . Without allies , the effort to ignite a widespread war was doomed . By mid @-@ July , writes historian Martin Zanger , " for all practical purposes the ' Red Bird Uprising ' was over " . 
 = = American response = = 
 The attacks created panic among the American population of the area . Settlers , fearing the outbreak of a wider Indian war , fled to towns such as Galena and Chicago , or sought sanctuary in the abandoned Fort Crawford . 
 Lewis Cass , the governor of Michigan Territory , and Thomas McKenney , the Superintendent of Indian Affairs , were hosting a treaty conference near Green Bay when they learned of the attacks . To discourage the spread of the uprising , Cass promptly invited Native Americans in the region to come to the treaty grounds to receive gifts and food ; more than 2 @,@ 000 people eventually arrived . McKenney warned the Ho @-@ Chunk chiefs in attendance that the only way to avoid an American military invasion of their homeland was to surrender those responsible for the attacks . Other American officials met with other Native leaders , including Keokuk and Wabokieshiek , and urged them to stay out of the war . 
 Meanwhile , American officials scrambled to mobilize troops . Cass hurried to Prairie du Chien , where he organized the local militia . Colonel Snelling arrived at Prairie du Chien on July 10 , bringing about 200 regulars from Fort Snelling to reoccupy Fort Crawford . He was joined there on July 29 by Brigadier General Henry Atkinson , who brought 500 men upriver by steamboat from Jefferson Barracks . Several days later , Henry Dodge arrived at Fort Crawford with 130 mounted militiamen , mostly miners . Governor Ninian Edwards of Illinois sent 600 mounted militiamen north to Wisconsin . 
 To the east , McKenney and Major William Whistler organized another force . Whistler had about 100 regulars from Fort Howard , along with 50 mostly métis militiamen from Green Bay , 60 New York Indians , and 120 Menominees . On August 29 , Atkinson 's force began moving up the Wisconsin River towards Portage , Wisconsin , where the hostile Ho @-@ Chunks had concentrated , while Whistler 's force converged on the same location from the north . 
 On September 1 , 1827 , McKenney and Whistler 's force arrived at the Portage . On September 3 , two Ho @-@ Chunk leaders , Waukon Decorah and <unk> , surrendered Red Bird and Wekau to the Americans . <unk> asked the Americans not to put irons on Red Bird and Wekau ; this request was granted . He then offered to give the Americans twenty horses in exchange for the prisoners , but this was declined . The Ho @-@ Chunks turned in four more men involved in the uprising in the following weeks . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In diplomatic talks with the Ho @-@ Chunks at the close of the war , General Atkinson promised that the U.S. government would look into their grievances in the lead mining region . Thomas McKenney requested military aid to evict American miners who were trespassing on Ho @-@ Chunk land , but after the war , settlers poured into the region in unprecedented numbers , and U.S. officials proved to be unable or unwilling to stem the tide . By January 1828 , there were as many as 10 @,@ 000 illegal settlers on Ho @-@ Chunk land , including militia general Henry Dodge , who established a mining camp after the war and boasted that the U.S. Army could not make him leave . Having no other options , on August 25 , 1828 , the Ho @-@ Chunks signed a provisional treaty with the United States , agreeing to sell the land occupied by the miners in a more formal treaty to be held later . 
 Eight Ho @-@ Chunks were detained by the U.S. government at Fort Crawford for trial after the war . American officials most wanted to convict Red Bird , believing that he had been the leader of the uprising . This belief , according to historian Martin Zanger , was based on an American failure to understand the decentralized nature of Ho @-@ Chunk society . " Because Red Bird was well known to the white frontiersmen , " writes Zanger , " they focused their resentment on him , mistakenly attributing to him a leadership role he did not deserve . " Red Bird was never tried ; he contracted dysentery and died in prison on February 16 , 1828 , before his trial got underway . 
 The trials were delayed due to the difficulties in bringing together witnesses , prosecutors , defense attorneys , and interpreters . The proceedings finally began in August 1828 , with Judge James Duane Doty presiding . Wau @-@ koo @-@ kau and Man @-@ ne @-@ tah @-@ peh @-@ keh , the two warriors imprisoned for the 1826 murders of the Methode family , were released due to a lack of witnesses , as were three Ho @-@ Chunks held for the attack on the keelboats . Only two men , Wekau and Chickhonsic , were prosecuted . According to historian Patrick Jung , it became clear during the trial that Red Bird had committed the murders at the Gagnier cabin , and that there was not enough evidence to convict Wekau and Chickhonsic . Despite this , the white and métis jury found them guilty . Judge Doty sentenced them to hang , as he was required to do by law . Their lawyer filed a motion for a new trial , arguing that the jury had ignored the evidence , and so Doty suspended the death sentences . 
 On November 3 , 1828 , President John Quincy Adams , having been told that the executions would likely spark another uprising , pardoned the prisoners in exchange for a land cession . In July and August 1829 , in treaties signed at Prairie du Chien , the Ho @-@ Chunks and the Three Fires Confederacy formally ceded the lead mining region to the United States for annual payments of $ 16 @,@ 000 and $ 18 @,@ 000 respectively . 
 Hoping to prevent further uprisings , the United States decided to strengthen its military presence in the region after the Winnebago War . Fort Crawford was reoccupied , as was Fort Dearborn in Chicago , which had been abandoned in 1823 . A new outpost , Fort Winnebago , was built in October 1828 at the portage between the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers . 
 The conflict also helped to promote a change in U.S. policy regarding Native Americans . Previously , many Americans had argued that Indians should be " civilized " and assimilated into white American society . But for some , the Winnebago War discredited the idea that Indians and Americans could live peaceably together . In his State of the Union Address of December 2 , 1828 , outgoing President Adams announced that the " civilization " policy had been a failure , and that Indian removal — moving the tribes to the West — was the policy of the future . That policy would be taken up by Adams 's successor , Andrew Jackson . 
 = The Modern Cook = 
 The Modern Cook was the first cookery book by the Anglo @-@ Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli ( 1805 – 1876 ) . It was first published in 1846 . It was popular for half a century in the Victorian era , running through 29 London editions by 1896 . It was also published in America . 
 The book offered elaborate dishes , described with French terminology such as bisque , entrées , entremets , vol @-@ au @-@ vent , <unk> and soufflé . It included bills of fare for meals for up to 300 people , and for a series of eight- or nine @-@ course dinners served to Queen Victoria ; one exceptional royal dinner in 1841 had sixteen entrées and sixteen entremets , including truffles in Champagne . 
 The Modern Cook was the first to mention filling wafer cones with ice cream . The book , written for upper middle @-@ class housewives , is illustrated with 60 engravings , often showing how to present carefully @-@ decorated centrepiece dishes such as " Salmon a la Chambord " for large dinner parties . 
 The book influenced households in Britain and America to aspire to more complex , French @-@ style dinners in imitation of the Queen , and resulted in a change in eating habits , including the modern two @-@ course approach for both lunch and dinner .

 Charles Elmé Francatelli , from an Italian family , was born in London in 1805 , and learnt cookery in France . Coming to England , he worked for various aristocrats before becoming chief chef of Crockford 's club and then chief cook to Queen Victoria in 1840 . He went on to work at Crockford 's again , at the Coventry House and Reform Clubs , St James 's Hotel , and for the Prince and Princess of Wales . This made him a celebrity cook of his time .

 = = = Approach = = = 
 Apart from the preface and Francatelli 's advice on serving wine , the body of the book consists almost entirely of recipes without any kind of introduction . There is no guidance on choice of kitchenware or advice on the layout of the kitchen . 
 The recipes are presented entirely as instructions , generally without illustration . Quantities , where stated , are incorporated in the text ; ingredients are never listed explicitly . Quantities are sometimes named , as in the " Cream <unk> Sauce " , which begins " Put six ounces of fresh butter into a middle @-@ sized <unk> ; add four ounces of sifted flour , some nutmeg , a few <unk> , and a little salt ; " . In other cases only the relative proportions are indicated , as for the " <unk> of <unk> with <unk> Jelly " , where the only hint of quantity in the recipe is " must be mixed with one @-@ third of its quantity of aspic jelly " . This recipe also indicates the style of cross @-@ referencing , with the starting instruction " Prepare the <unk> as directed in No. 1078 " . 
 The Modern Cook is the first published record in England of filling wafer cornets , which Francatelli called <unk> , with ice cream . He used them to garnish his iced puddings .

 The 28th edition is illustrated with 60 , mostly small , engravings . There is a full @-@ page frontispiece of the author , drawn by Auguste Hervieu and engraved by Samuel Freeman ( 1773 – 1857 ) . Freeman is known for working mainly in stipple , and the portrait here is no exception . 
 All the other engravings are of completed dishes , showing the serving @-@ plate with the food arranged on it and often elaborately garnished . The artists and engravers of the food illustrations are not identified . 
 = = = Bills of fare = = = 
 Francatelli provides " A Series of Bills of Fare for Every Month Throughout the Year " , including dinners variously for 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 16 , 18 , 20 , 24 , 28 and 36 persons ( though not all of these in every month ) . The bills of fare for dinners for 6 persons thus represent the simplest menus in the book . All the dinners are divided into a first and a second " Course " , but each course was divided in turn into three or four servings , in most cases with a choice of two or more dishes . Thus there might be one or two soups , two fishes , two " removes " of meat , and two savoury " entrées " in the first " Course " , with a second " Course " of one kind of game , followed by a choice of three " entremets " which included both savouries , generally vegetables , and desserts . 
 There is a single bill of fare for a " Ball Supper for 300 Persons " , and one for a " Public Dinner " for the same number . 
 There are 13 bills of fare for " Her Majesty 's Dinner " , each with an exact date in 1841 and the words " ( Under the control of C. Francatelli . ) " . Each of the royal dinners has either eight or nine courses ( including a buffet or sideboard ) , except for that of 30 June which is divided into two " Services " and has 11 courses . 
 The royal dinners are described almost entirely in French , with the exception of the heading , the phrase " Side Board " , and a few specifically British dishes such as " Roast Mutton " and " <unk> of Venison " . There are usually two soups , two fishes , two removes , six entrées , two roasts , two more removes , six entremets , and between two and seven dishes on the sideboard . The exceptional royal dinner of 30 June 1841 had sixteen entrées and sixteen entremets . Some of these entremets used the most costly ingredients including truffles in Champagne .

 Kettner 's Book of the Table of 1877 , describing Francatelli as " a type of all the great French cooks " , asserted that he " gives a most elaborate recipe for aspic jelly ; and he is so satisfied with it that , having to prepare a cold supper for 300 people , he works it up in every one of his 56 dishes which are neither sweet nor hot . The book further argues that " this is the result of science — this the height of art . It produces , with such elaborate forms and majestic ceremonies , an aspic jelly without aspic , that , exhausted in the effort , it can proceed no further , and seems to think that here at last , in this supreme sauce , we have a sure resting @-@ place — the true blessedness — the <unk> . " 
 George H. <unk> wrote in his Pleasures of the Table in 1902 that Francatelli 's Modern Cook was " still a superior treatise , and although little adapted to the average household , it will well repay careful study on the part of the expert amateur . ' The palate is as capable and nearly as worthy of education as the eye and the ear , ' says Francatelli — a statement which his volume abundantly bears out . " He added that " one sees , accordingly , an ornate observance of decoration in his grand army of side @-@ dishes . These are excellent throughout , but generally very elaborate , while his sauces and recipes for pastry are especially good . The same may be said of his quenelles and timbales . A competent hand will find his work a valuable guide from which to obtain ideas ; it is not a practical book for the majority . " 
 The New Zealand Herald of 1912 commented that Francatelli was " an earnest and gifted worker in the cause of gastronomy " and that The Modern Cook faithfully reflected Victorian dining habits . " Everything was good and solid of its kind , even if tending towards complication rather than simplicity . " The review opined that the great joints of meat " decorated with their silver <unk> skewers bearing cock 's combs and <unk> , were attended by the most <unk> <unk> and garnishes . " Despite the gloss , there was " nothing meretricious or deceptive in the savoury promises held out by Victorian <unk> . " The reviewer notes , however , that even while Francatelli was describing this elaborate fare , the " excessive meat @-@ eating " was being replaced by a diet richer in vegetables , and meals were becoming simpler , so that " now , in the 20th century , much that Francatelli wrote about ... is no longer needed . "

 M. F. K. Fisher , writing in The New York Times , stated that millions of American women in the 19th century organised " every aspect of their lives .. as much as possible in imitation of the Queen " , and that The Modern Cook sold almost as well in America as it did in England . Admitting that few American kitchens could " follow all its directions for the light Gallic dainties Francatelli introduced to counteract the basic heaviness of royal dining habits " , she argued that all the same his two @-@ course approach eventually shaped the way Americans now eat both lunch and dinner . She observed that at Windsor Castle , Francatelli and other royal chefs were assisted by 24 assistant chefs and two " Yeomen of the Kitchen " , not to mention a multitude of " servers and lackeys " . This did not deter American housewives " as far west as Iowa and then beyond " from doing their best to follow his instructions . 
 The Historic Food website notes that Francatelli provides two recipes for mincemeat , one with roast beef , the other containing lemons but no meat . 
 C. Anne Wilson , introducing Women and Victorian Values , 1837 @-@ 1910 . Advice Books , Manuals and Journals for Women , states that Francatelli was writing for the " upper middle @-@ class housewife " in The Modern Cook , explaining to her how to serve the " socially important " dinner in English , French and " à la Russe " styles . In contrast , his 1861 Cook 's Guide is for " more ordinary " households , advocating " traditional two @-@ course dinners " . 
 Nick Baines writes on <unk> that Francatelli included " a whole collection of lavish pies " in the book . 
 Panikos Panayi , in his book <unk> Up Britain , writes that Francatelli 's book for the middle classes definitely recognised differences between British and foreign foods , even in its full title which ran " ... Comprising , in Addition to English Cookery , the Most Advanced and <unk> Systems of French , Italian and German Cookery " . Panayi notes that Francatelli 's preface to the first edition was scathing about ignorant " English writers on gastronomy " , comparing them unfavourably to the " great Professors " of cuisine in France . Panayi observes further that while most of Francatelli 's chapters are not grouped by national origin , he does distinguish English , Foreign , and Italian soups . He notes that it would have taken years to eat all the dishes listed , and that it is impossible to tell how often middle class families may have eaten " fillets of <unk> , à la royale " . He considers it likely that only the wealthiest could have aspired to eat the sort of food described by Francatelli , but concedes that his bills of fare for dinners for six persons ( by month ) do indicate that the middle classes could afford the best meat and vegetables , and indeed that they had domestic staff able to prepare dinners of that complexity described in Francatelli 's French terminology . Panayi concludes that Francatelli represents " perhaps the most extreme example " of the <unk> century British habit of giving dishes French descriptions .

 Frederick Lee " Ted " Petoskey ( January 5 , 1911 – November 30 , 1996 ) was a three @-@ sport athlete at the University of Michigan , a Major League Baseball player , a collegiate coach in three sports and an athletic director . 
 At the University of Michigan , Petoskey received eight varsity letters in three sports . In American football , he was a two @-@ time All @-@ American end for the undefeated Michigan Wolverines football teams that won back @-@ to @-@ back college football national championships in 1932 and 1933 . He was also a guard and captain of Michigan 's basketball team in the 1933 – 34 season . As a baseball player in 1934 , Petoskey led the Big Ten Conference with a .452 batting average . 
 Petoskey played parts of the 1934 and 1935 Major League Baseball seasons as an outfielder for the Cincinnati Reds and played minor league baseball until 1944 . Petoskey also served in a variety of collegiate coaching positions , including head coach of the University of South Carolina 's basketball team ( 1935 – 1940 ) , athletic director and football coach at Wofford College , and head baseball coach at the University of South Carolina ( 1940 – 42 , 1948 – 56 ) .

 Petoskey was raised in St. Charles , Michigan and attended nearby Saginaw Eastern High School . On October 22 , 1926 , Petoskey became the first receiver in Michigan High School Athletic Association history to garner five receiving touchdowns in a high school football game . As of August 2002 , the record had not been surpassed . While playing for Saginaw , Petoskey was an all @-@ state end two years and an all @-@ state fullback another . He once played in a game with University of Michigan head coach Fielding H. Yost in the stands . Petoskey ran back the opening kickoff for 87 yards and a touchdown , and after hearing that Yost was in the stands ran back another kickoff in the second half for 92 yards and a touchdown .

 In Petoskey 's three years as a varsity football player , the Wolverines had a combined record of 23 – 1 – 2 and won two national championships . As a sophomore in 1931 , Petoskey was touted as " a second Bennie Oosterbaan , " and earned a spot on the United Press All @-@ Big Ten Conference second team . 
 In his junior year , Petoskey was one of the favorite pass receivers for quarterback Harry Newman , who won the Douglas Fairbanks trophy as the Most Valuable Player in college football . Coach Harry Kipke shifted Petoskey to fullback mid @-@ way through the 1932 season , and he scored two touchdowns in a 32 – 0 win over Illinois . The United Press noted : " A running attack which featured Ted Petoskey , converted from an end to a fullback in the last week by Coach Harry Kipke dovetailed nicely with the Wolverine aerial play to produce the touchdowns . With Petoskey plunging the line and sweeping inside the ends for many sizeable gains , the Michigan eleven showed power through the line for the first time this season . " An Associated Press writer warned opponents to watch out for Petoskey : " It is about time for grid <unk> to wake up when Ted Petoskey , end and fullback on the University of Michigan football team , gets to dreaming . Petoskey 's dreams have a habit of coming true , and happily for Petoskey , most of his dreams are good ones . " 
 Petoskey was selected as a first @-@ team All @-@ American in 1932 by the All @-@ American Football Board , a second @-@ team All @-@ American by the New York Sun , and a third @-@ team All @-@ American by the United Press . After the 1932 team compiled a perfect 8 – 0 record ( outscoring opponents 123 – 13 ) and won the national championship , the press credited the squad 's " esprit de corps " as a key to their success . As an example of Wolverine teamwork , a United Press story pointed to a fumble in the Minnesota game . " Michigan recovered , with both Ted Petoskey , end , and Charles Bernard , center , at the bottom of the heap . Bernard credited Petoskey . Petoskey said Bernard recovered . "

 During his senior year , Petoskey started all eight games at left end for the 1933 Michigan Wolverines football team , as Michigan won its second consecutive national championship , and Petoskey was again named an All @-@ American . Although Petoskey was principally an end , Coach Kipke played Petoskey at fullback in some games in 1933 . An October 1933 newspaper story reported on his versatility : " Ted Petoskey , Michigan 's brilliant right end was moved into the backfield for last night 's practice ... This is the second time Petoskey has figured in such a shift . Last fall he was converted into a fullback before the Illinois game and proved a capable ground gainer . Monday he was given a trial as a forward passer , and made an impressive showing . " In his final game for the Michigan football team , Petoskey also kicked a 35 @-@ yard field goal against Northwestern , representing the final points scored for Michigan in its 1933 championship season . 
 After the 1933 season , Petoskey was chosen as a first @-@ team All @-@ American in the Central Press Association poll of team captains , and for the second @-@ team by Grantland Rice . Petoskey also finished third in the voting for the Associated Press 1933 Big Ten Athlete of the Year award . In choosing Petoskey for his All @-@ American team , football writer Lawrence Perry said : " Ted Petoskey of Michigan is one of the finest ends who ever played the game . A former halfback , he is superb as an end @-@ around runner . He receives forward passes with great accuracy and when he catches the ball he is difficult to bring down . " 
 Coach Kipke credited the play of halfback , Herman Everhardus , and his ends for the undefeated season : " Our ends , Ward and Petoskey , were near perfection . " The 1934 University of Michigan yearbook , called the Michiganensian , described Petoskey 's contributions as follows : " After three years of Varsity football , Petoskey is recognized as one of Michigan 's greatest all @-@ time ends . At the end of his junior year , he was chosen All American , and recognized as one of the greatest defense players in the country . He was alert , followed every play , and opponents found it almost impossible to gain around his end . " In 1955 , Kipke rated Petoskey as one of the six best players he ever coached : " If I had to name the best player I ever coached , it would have to be among Harry Newman , Francis Wistert , Otto <unk> , Ted Petoskey and Maynard Morrison . " 
 When the Associated Press picked Petoskey as only a second @-@ team All @-@ American in 1933 , ten @-@ year @-@ old Mary Lee Grossman from Saginaw , Michigan protested in a letter to AP sports editor , Alan Gould , that he had " chosen wrong " in leaving Petoskey and Whitey Wistert off the first @-@ team . To avoid any appearance of bias , the Saginaw native noted : " You may think I am a friend of these boys but I do not know either of them . I hope you change your mind . " Gould responded to Miss Grossman in his column : " You may be right , Mary Lee , but it 's too late now to change our mind . "

 Petoskey was also the captain of the 1933 – 34 Wolverines basketball team . For the versatile Petoskey , baseball was his best sport .

 Immediately after graduating , Petoskey and Michigan teammate Whitey Wistert both signed with the Cincinnati Reds , reporting to the team in early June 1934 . Petoskey made his major league debut on September 9 , 1934 , and Wistert made his debut two days later . Petoskey played in six games in 1934 , where he went hitless and struck out five times in seven at bats . On the last day of the 1934 regular season , Petoskey was a strikeout victim of Dizzy Dean in the ninth inning of Dean 's 30th win of the year . When the baseball season ended , Petoskey and Wistert both returned to Ann Arbor , Michigan in early October , where they were given coaching assignments helping Ray Fisher teach fundamentals and offering personal tutoring to the freshman football team . 
 Petoskey returned to the Reds in 1935 , but after spring training he was assigned to the minor leagues . He played for the Wilmington Pirates in the Piedmont League for most of the 1935 season , where he was hitting .426 to lead the league in early June . The Reds called up Petoskey in June , and one newspaper noted that when he was called up , Petoskey was " batting above the .400 mark , leading the ( Piedmont ) league in home runs , runs driven in and practically everything else . " He was two @-@ for @-@ five with a stolen base and a .400 batting average in four games for the 1935 Reds , but he played his last game for the Reds on June 20 , 1935 . 
 Petoskey played for the Durham Bulls in the Piedmont League in 1936 , where he was hitting .428 in late May . He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1937 , where he was leading the International League in base hits in mid @-@ June .

 In August 1942 , Petoskey was hired by Wofford College as its head football coach and director of physical education . At the time , Petoskey had been playing for the Columbia Reds in the Sally League . Petoskey remained at Wofford through 1947 , taking time off at times to revive his baseball career . In 1944 , Petoskey was a player and manager for the Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association in 1944 . In 1945 , he left Wofford for the summer to play for the Buffalo Bisons in the International League . He returned to Wofford after World War II . Wofford had suspended its football and basketball programs in 1943 and 1944 , but Petoskey announced that the school would bring both programs back in the 1945 – 46 school year . He also served as coach of the Wofford football team .

In twelve seasons as South Carolina 's head baseball coach , Petoskey compiled a record of 113 – 120 . Petoskey 's baseball players remembered his love of playing poker and his bringing the team home hungry after a tough loss to Duke . In what team members remembered as the " hunger game , " an angry Coach Petoskey told the players to " get on the bus , " and the team rode from Durham , North Carolina to Columbia , South Carolina ( 236 miles ) without having eaten . Another time against Furman University , the Gamecocks blew an 11 – 2 lead in the 8th inning to lose 12 – 11 . On the bus , Petoskey had " that look , " and the driver figured the team would receive a tongue @-@ lashing .

 In December 1956 , Petoskey announced he was leaving the University of South Carolina to work for the New York Yankees , as a baseball scout for the Georgia , North Carolina , South Carolina and eastern Tennessee territory . As a Yankees ' scout , he signed Duke catcher Steve <unk> to a contract . And in 1959 , when the Yankees moved spring training for their farm system to Columbia , South Carolina , Petoskey was responsible for the logistics and preparing Capital City Park . He served in the mid @-@ 1960s as the director of recreation for the South Carolina Department of Corrections . Petoskey died in Elgin , South Carolina at age 85 in 1996 . 
 His son Ted Petoskey , Jr . , followed his father playing end in American football . Ted , Jr . , was chosen to play end for the South Carolina high school team in the 1959 Shrine Bowl against the North Carolina team , and was named South Carolina high school AAA Lineman of the Year . He went on to play end for the Clemson Tigers football team from 1962 to 1964 .

 = Psilocybe hispanica = 
 Psilocybe hispanica is a species of fungus in the family Hymenogastraceae . It produces small brown mushrooms with conical to convex caps up to 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter and stems 16 to 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 6 to 1 @.@ 0 in ) long by 0 @.@ 5 to 1 mm ( 0 @.@ 02 to 0 @.@ 04 in ) thick . Reported as new to science in 2000 , it is only known from the Pyrenees mountain range in northern Spain and southwestern France , where it grows on horse dung in grass fields at elevations of 1 @,@ 700 to 2 @,@ 300 m ( 5 @,@ 600 to 7 @,@ 500 ft ) . The mushroom contains the psychoactive compound psilocybin . The possible depiction of this species in the 6 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old Selva Pascuala rock art suggests that it might have been used in ancient religious rituals — the oldest evidence of such usage in prehistoric Europe . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was described by Mexican mycologist Gastón Guzmán in a 2000 publication , based on specimens collected by Ignacio <unk> <unk> near Huesca in northern Spain in 1995 . Psilocybe hispanica is classified in the section <unk> of the genus Psilocybe because of its thick @-@ walled spores and fruit body that bruises blue with handling . The specific epithet hispanica is Latin for " Spanish " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap ranges in shape from somewhat conical to convex , and reaches diameters of 5 to 10 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 4 in ) . Its surface is smooth , somewhat sticky to dry , and brown to brownish @-@ yellow . The gills are somewhat adnate , and brown @-@ violaceous with whitish edges . The stem is 16 to 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 6 to 1 @.@ 0 in ) long by 0 @.@ 5 to 1 mm ( 0 @.@ 02 to 0 @.@ 04 in ) thick , cylindrical , and slightly bulbous at the base . It is whitish @-@ yellow , with vinaceous or blue @-@ green to blackish tones towards the base . Mature specimens do not have a veil on the stem . The flesh is whitish , but like most psilocybin @-@ containing species , stains blue when injured . 
 The spores are ellipsoid and measure 12 – 14 @.@ 5 by 6 @.@ 5 – 8 μm . They have a brownish @-@ yellow wall greater than 1 μm thick and a broad apical germ pore with an acute hilar appendix at the base ( a region where the spore was once attached to the sterigma ) . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells in the hymenium ) are four @-@ spored , hyaline ( translucent ) , and measure 32 – 44 by 8 – 12 μm . The cap cuticle is made of a layer 130 – 150 μm thick , with hyaline , thin @-@ walled gelatinized hyphae measuring 1 @.@ 5 – 4 μm broad . The hypodermium ( the tissue layer directly under the pileipellis ) is made of thin @-@ walled , hyaline hyphae , 2 @.@ 5 – 8 μm broad , with a brownish <unk> pigment . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Psilocybe semilanceata is roughly similar in appearance to P. hispanica , but may distinguished by its mycenoid ( Mycena @-@ like ) appearance and acute umbonate cap . Although the grassland habitat of the two species is similar , P. semilanceata does not grow directly on dung ; rather , it is a saprobic species that grows on decaying grass roots . P. <unk> also resembles P. hispanica , but it also has a mycenoid appearance and has a ring on the stem . In terms of microscopic characteristics , P. <unk> has larger cheilocystidia that measure 20 – 32 by 4 – 8 μm . P. hispanica differs from P. liniformans var. liniformans in that it lacks a gelatinous gill edge . P. liniformans var. americana has larger cheilocystidia , measuring 22 – 33 by 5 @.@ 5 – 9 μm , and it is known to grow only on soil around herbs , in the Northwest and Northeast USA and Chile . <unk> <unk> ( formerly known as Psilocybe <unk> ) is a small brownish mushroom that also grows on dung , but it does not contain psilocybin and does not have a bluing stem . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Psilocybe hispanica is a coprophilous fungus ( dung @-@ loving ) , and produces fruit bodies that grow solitarily or in dense groups on horse dung ; sometimes more than 25 fruit bodies can arise from the same dung . In Guzmán 's original report , they were found in a Pyrenean meadow in Aragon , at an elevation of 2 @,@ 300 metres ( 7 @,@ 500 ft ) . In 2003 , the species was reported from <unk> de Tena , a small village in the Pyrenees ; it was also reported to have " penetrated the French part of the Pyrenees " . Within its restricted range , the mushroom is " very common " at altitudes of 1 @,@ 700 to 2 @,@ 300 m ( 5 @,@ 600 to 7 @,@ 500 ft ) . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The mushroom is consumed recreationally by Spanish youths for its mind @-@ altering effects ; other mushrooms used recreationally in Spain include P. semilanceata and P. <unk> . Guzmán and Castro report that a 17th @-@ century medallion found in Tena Valley in the southern Pyrenees had images of a devil and mushrooms carved on it . The mushrooms — possibly either P. semilanceata or P. hispanica , according to Guzmán and Castro — were used in witchcraft , a common practice in the valley during the Middle Ages . 
 It has been argued that prehistoric rock art at a site known as Selva Pascuala near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo offers evidence that P. hispanica was used in religious rituals 6 @,@ 000 years ago . The rock shelter at Selva Pascuala was discovered in the early 20th century ; in the early 21st century it was noticed that objects in one of the murals , which previously had been described as " mushrooms " , matched the general morphology of P. hispanica : the mural depicts a row of 13 mushroom @-@ like objects with convex to conical caps , and ringless stems that vary from straight to sinuous ( wavy ) . Additionally , the mural shows a bull , which suggests an association with the <unk> P. hispanica . Although the hallucinogenic species P. semilanceata is also widespread in the area where the mural was found , its differing shape ( narrowly conical and acutely papillate ) and its habitat on soil instead of dung suggests it is not the species represented in the mural . If the interpretation is correct , the mural represents the oldest evidence of psychedelic fungi use in Europe , and the third reported instance of rock art suggesting prehistoric usage of neurotropic fungi . The only older example is from Tassili n 'Ajjer , in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria . In 1992 , the Italian ethnobotanist Giorgio <unk> reported finding a painted mural dated 7000 to 9000 BCE portraying mushrooms , later tentatively identified as Psilocybe <unk> , a species known from Algeria and Morocco . 
 = Valhalla = 
 In Norse mythology , Valhalla ( from Old Norse <unk> " hall of the slain " ) is a majestic , enormous hall located in Asgard , ruled over by the god Odin . Chosen by Odin , half of those who die in combat travel to Valhalla upon death , led by valkyries , while the other half go to the goddess Freyja 's field Fólkvangr . In Valhalla , the dead join the masses of those who have died in combat known as Einherjar , as well as various legendary Germanic heroes and kings , as they prepare to aid Odin during the events of Ragnarök . Before the hall stands the golden tree <unk> , and the hall 's ceiling is thatched with golden shields . Various creatures live around Valhalla , such as the stag Eikþyrnir and the goat Heiðrún , both described as standing atop Valhalla and consuming the foliage of the tree Læraðr . 
 Valhalla is attested in the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources , the Prose Edda , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson , Heimskringla , also written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson , and in stanzas of an anonymous 10th century poem commemorating the death of Eric Bloodaxe known as Eiríksmál as compiled in Fagrskinna . Valhalla has inspired various works of art , publication titles , popular culture references , and has become a term synonymous with a martial ( or otherwise ) hall of the chosen dead .

 Valhalla is referenced at length in the Poetic Edda poem Grímnismál , and Helgakviða Hundingsbana II , while Valhalla receives lesser direct references in stanza 33 of the Völuspá , where the god Baldr 's death is referred to as the " woe of Valhalla " , and in stanzas 1 to 3 of Hyndluljóð , where the goddess Freyja states her intention of riding to Valhalla with Hyndla , in an effort to help Óttar , as well as in stanzas 6 through 7 , where Valhalla is mentioned again during a dispute between the two . 
 = = = = Grímnismál = = = = 
 In stanzas 8 to 10 of Grímnismál , the god Odin ( in the guise of Grímnir ) states that Valhalla is located in the realm of <unk> . Odin describes Valhalla as shining and golden , and that it " rises peacefully " when seen from afar . From Valhalla , every day Odin chooses from those who have died in combat . Valhalla has spear @-@ shafts for rafters , a roof thatched with shields , coats of mail are strewn over its benches , a wolf hangs in front of its west doors , and an eagle hovers above it . 
 From stanzas 22 to 24 , more details are given by Odin about Valhalla : the holy doors of the ancient gate <unk> stand before Valhalla , Valhalla has five hundred and forty doors that eight hundred men can exit from at once ( from which the einherjar will flow forth to engage the wolf Fenrir at Ragnarök ) . Within Valhalla exists Thor 's hall <unk> , and within it exist five hundred and forty rooms , and of all the halls within Valhalla , Odin states that he thinks his son 's may be greatest . In stanzas 25 through 26 , Odin states that the goat Heiðrún and the hart Eikþyrnir stand on top of Valhalla and graze on the branches of the tree Læraðr . Heiðrún produces vats of mead that liquor cannot be compared to , and from Eikþyrnir 's antlers drip liquid into the spring Hvergelmir from which flows forth all waters . 
 = = = = Helgakviða Hundingsbana II = = = = 
 In stanza 38 of the poem Helgakviða Hundingsbana II , the hero Helgi Hundingsbane dies and goes to Valhalla . In stanza 38 , Helgi 's glory there is described : 
 So was Helgi beside the chieftains 
 like the bright @-@ growing ash beside the thorn @-@ bush 
 and the young stag , drenched in dew , 
 who surpasses all other animals 
 and whose horns glow against the sky itself . 
 Prose follows after this stanza , stating that a burial @-@ mound was made for Helgi , and that when Helgi arrived in Valhalla , he was asked by Odin to manage things with him . In stanza 39 , Helgi , now in Valhalla , has his former enemy Hunding — also in Valhalla — do menial tasks ; fetching foot @-@ baths for all of the men there , kindling fire , tying dogs , keeping watch of horses , and feeding the pigs before he can get any sleep . In stanzas 40 to 42 , Helgi has returned to Midgard from Valhalla with a host of men . An unnamed maid of Sigrún , Helgi 's valkyrie wife , sees Helgi and his large host of men riding into the mound . The maid asks if she is experiencing a delusion , if Ragnarök has begun , or if Helgi and his men have been allowed to return . 
 In the stanzas that follow , Helgi responds that none of these things have occurred , and so Sigrún 's maid goes home to Sigrún . The maid tells Sigrún that the burial mound has opened up , and that Sigrún should go to Helgi there , as Helgi has asked her to come and tend his wounds , which have opened up and are bleeding . Sigrún goes into the mound , and finds that Helgi is drenched in gore , his hair is thick with frost . Filled with joy at the reunion , Sigrún kisses him before he can remove his coat of mail , and asks how she can heal him . Sigrún makes a bed there , and the two sleep together in the enclosed burial mound . Helgi awakens , stating that he must " ride along the blood @-@ red roads , to set the pale horse to tread the path of the sky , " and return before the rooster <unk> crows . Helgi and the host of men ride away , and Sigrún and her servant go back to their house . Sigrún has her maid wait for him by the mound the next night , but when she arrives at dawn , she finds that he has not returned . The prose narrative at the end of the poem relates that Sigrún dies of sadness , but that the two are thought to have been reborn as Helgi <unk> and the valkyrie <unk> .

 Valhalla is referenced in the Prose Edda books Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál . 
 = = = = Gylfaginning = = = = 
 Valhalla is first mentioned in chapter 2 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning , where it is described partially in euhemerized form . In the chapter , King Gylfi sets out to Asgard in the guise of an old man going by the name of Gangleri to find the source of the power of the gods . The narrative states that the Æsir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for him , so that when <unk> enters the fortress , he sees a hall of such a height that he has trouble seeing over it , and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields , as if they were shingles . Snorri then quotes a stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir ( c . 900 ) . As he continues , Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords , and keeping seven in the air at once . Among other things , the man says that the hall belongs to his king , and adds that he can take Gangleri to the king . Gangleri follows him , and the door closes behind him . All around him he sees many living areas , and throngs of people , some of which are playing games , some are drinking , and others are fighting with weapons . Gangleri sees three thrones , and three figures sitting upon them : High sitting on the lowest throne , Just @-@ As @-@ High sitting on the next highest throne , and Third sitting on the highest . The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall . 
 In chapter 20 , Third states that Odin mans Valhalla with the Einherjar : the dead who fall in battle and become Odin 's adopted sons . In chapter 36 , High states that valkyries serve drinks and see to the tables in Valhalla , and Grímnismál stanzas 40 to 41 are then quoted in reference to this . High continues that the valkyries are sent by Odin to every battle , where they choose who is to die , and determine victory . 
 In chapter 38 , Gangleri says : " You say that all men who have fallen in battle from the beginning of the world are now with Odin in Valhalla . With what does he feed them ? I should think the crowd there is large . " High responds that this is indeed true , that a huge amount are already in Valhalla , but yet this amount will seem to be too few when " the wolf comes . " High describes that there are never too many to feed in Valhalla , for they feast from Sæhrímnir ( here described as a boar ) , and that this beast is cooked every day and is again whole every night . Grímnismál stanza 18 is then recounted . Gangleri asks if Odin himself eats the same food as the Einherjar , and High responds that Odin needs nothing to eat — Odin only consumes wine — and he gives his food to his wolves Geri and Freki . Grímnismál stanza 19 is then recounted . High additionally states that at sunrise , Odin sends his ravens Huginn and Muninn from Valhalla to fly throughout the entire world , and they return in time for the first meal there . 
 In chapter 39 , Gangleri asks about the food and drinks the Einherjar consume , and asks if only water is available there . High replies that , of course , Valhalla has food and drinks fit for kings and jarls , for the mead consumed in Valhalla is produced from the udders of the goat Heiðrún , who in turn feeds on the leaves of the " famous tree " Læraðr . The goat produces so much mead in a day that it fills a massive vat large enough for all of the Einherjar in Valhalla to satisfy their thirst from it . High further states that the stag Eikþyrnir stands atop Valhalla and chews on the branches of Læraðr . So much moisture drips from his horns that it falls down to the well <unk> , resulting in numerous rivers . 
 In chapter 40 , Gangleri muses that Valhalla must be quite crowded , to which High responds by stating that Valhalla is massive and remains roomy despite the large amount of inhabitants , and then quotes Grímnismál stanza 23 . In chapter 41 , Gangleri says that Odin seems to be quite a powerful lord , as he controls quite a big army , but he yet wonders how the Einherjar keep themselves busy when they are not drinking . High replies that daily , after they 've dressed and put on their war gear , they go out to the courtyard and battle one another in one @-@ on @-@ one combat for sport . Then , when mealtime comes , they ride home to Valhalla and drink . High then quotes Vafþrúðnismál stanza 41 . In chapter 42 , High describes that , " right at the beginning , when the gods were settling " they had established Asgard and then built Valhalla . The death of the god Baldr is recounted in chapter 49 , where the mistletoe that is used to kill Baldr is described as growing west of Valhalla . 
 = = = = Skáldskaparmál = = = = 
 At the beginning of Skáldskaparmál , a partially euhemerized account is given of Ægir visiting the gods in Asgard and shimmering swords are brought out and used as their sole source of light as they drink . There , numerous gods feast , they have plenty of strong mead , and the hall has wall @-@ panels covered with attractive shields . This location is confirmed as Valhalla in chapter 33 . 
 In chapter 2 , a quote from the anonymous 10th century poem Eiríksmál is provided ( see the Fagrskinna section below for more detail and another translation from another source ) : 
 What sort of dream is that , Odin ? I dreamed I rose up before dawn to clear up Val @-@ hall for slain people . I aroused the <unk> , bade them get up to strew the benches , clean the beer @-@ cups , the valkyries to serve wine for the arrival of a prince . 
 In chapter 17 of Skáldskaparmál , the jötunn Hrungnir is in a rage and , while attempting to catch up and attack Odin on his steed Sleipnir , ends up at the doors to Valhalla . There , the Æsir invite him in for a drink . Hrungnir goes in , demands a drink , and becomes drunk and belligerent , stating that he will remove Valhalla and take it to the land of the jötunn , Jötunheimr , among various other things . Eventually , the gods tire of his boasting and invoke Thor , who arrives . Hrungnir states that Thor is under their protection , and subsequently he can 't be harmed while in Valhalla . After an exchange of words , Hrungnir challenges Thor to a duel at the location of <unk> , resulting in Hrungnir 's death . 
 In chapter 34 , the tree <unk> is stated as located in front of the doors of Valhalla . The tree is described as having foliage of red gold and being the most beautiful tree among both gods and men . A quote from a work by the 9th century skald Bragi Boddason is presented that confirms the description . 
 = = = Heimskringla = = = 
 Valhalla is mentioned in euhemerized form and as an element of remaining Norse pagan belief in Heimskringla . In chapter 8 of Ynglinga saga , the " historical " Odin is described as <unk> burial laws over his country . These laws include that all the dead are to be burned on a pyre on a burial mound with their possessions , and their ashes are to be brought out to sea or buried in the earth . The dead would then arrive in Valhalla with everything that one had on their pyre , and whatever one had hidden in the ground . Valhalla is additionally referenced in the phrase " visiting Odin " in a work by the 10th century skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir describing that , upon his death , King <unk> went to Valhalla . 
 In chapter 32 of Hákonar saga <unk> , Haakon I of Norway is given a pagan burial , which is described as sending him on his way to Valhalla . Verses from Hákonarmál are then quoted in support , themselves containing references to Valhalla . 
 = = = Fagrskinna = = = 
 In chapter 8 of Fagrskinna , a prose narrative states that , after the death of her husband Eric Bloodaxe , Gunnhild Mother of Kings had a poem composed about him . The composition is by an anonymous author from the 10th century and is referred to as Eiríksmál , and describes Eric Bloodaxe and five other kings arriving in Valhalla after their death . The poem begins with comments by Odin ( as Old Norse Óðinn ) : 
 <unk> kind of a dream is it , ' said Óðinn , 
 in which just before daybreak , 
 I thought I cleared Valhǫll , 
 for coming of slain men ? 
 I waked the Einherjar , 
 bade valkyries rise up , 
 to strew the bench , 
 and scour the beakers , 
 wine to carry , 
 as for a king 's coming , 
 here to me I expect 
 heroes ' coming from the world , 
 certain great ones , 
 so glad is my heart . 
 The god Bragi asks where a thundering sound is coming from , and says that the benches of Valhalla are creaking — as if the god Baldr had returned to Valhalla — and that it sounds like the movement of a thousand . Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe , who will soon arrive in Valhalla . Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall , if it is indeed he . 
 Sigmund asks Odin why he would expect Eric more than any other king , to which Odin responds that Eric has reddened his gore @-@ drenched sword with many other lands . Eric arrives , and Sigmund greets him , tells him that he is welcome to come into the hall , and asks him what other lords he has brought with him to Valhalla . Eric says that with him are five kings , that he will tell them the name of them all , and that he , himself , is the sixth .

 = NSB Di 3 = 
 NSB Di 3 is a class of 35 diesel @-@ electric locomotives built by NOHAB for the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) . The class was built between 1954 and 1969 , and delivered in two series , Di 3a and Di 3b . They are based on the Electro @-@ Motive Division F7 and are equipped with EMD 567 engines . They have a distinct bulldog nose and were numbered 602 – 633 ( a @-@ series ) and 641 – 643 ( b @-@ series ) . The locomotives had a prime mover that gives a power output of 1 @,@ 305 kilowatts ( 1 @,@ 750 hp ) . The a @-@ series has a Co 'Co ' wheel arrangement , while the b @-@ series has ( A1A ) ' ( A1A ) ' . The b @-@ series has higher top speed , but lower tractive effort . 
 The class was the dominant locomotive on NSB 's unelectrified lines . It was ordered as part of the company 's <unk> of services during the 1950s and 1960s , and was initially used on the three mainline routes of the Bergen , Dovre and Nordland Lines . In the 1960s the Bergen and Dovre Lines were electrified and the Di 3 units transferred to smaller lines , such as the Meråker , Valdres , Røros , Solør and Rauma Lines . They remained in service with NSB until 2001 , five years later than planned due to NSB returning their successor , the Di 6 . The units are still in use by the private operator Ofotbanen , the Kosovo Railways , an operator in Sicily , and the Norwegian Railway Museum . The class is similar to the DSB Class MY and <unk> M61 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The first diesel locomotive used by NSB was a single Di 1 unit delivered in 1942 . It was more cost @-@ efficient than the steam locomotives used on the non @-@ electrified lines , and in 1945 , NSB decided that it would not order more steam locomotives . General Motors ' Electro Motive Division ( EMD ) made a bid to deliver twelve units based on their F7 , and NSB agreed to lease a single unit for trial . The body and mechanical components were built by NOHAB , the motors by ASEA and prime mover by EMD . While under production in 1954 , GM shipped a G12 for trial in Norway and Sweden . It was tested on the express train on the Dovre Line on 7 August , but proved to have insufficient power , causing the train to be 20 minutes late . 
 The trial unit from NOHAB was delivered on 17 September 1954 . The first test runs in scheduled service were on the Nordland Line between Trondheim and Mo i Rana in October . There were no technical faults until 22 December , when a grounding error caused the locomotive to be grounded until 17 January . In March the unit was sent back to NOHAB and went on a marketing tour that would eventually reach Ankara , Turkey in 1955 . 
 The locomotive returned to Norway on 1 July 1955 , where it was numbered 602 and put into service on the Nordland Line . The trials were successful , with much higher regularity than the steam locomotives . The Di 3 was used eight days in a row , and then spent a single day in the depot . NSB signed an agreement with NOHAB for delivery of five further locomotives . This caused a public debate , because the domestic supplier Thune had offered to build a similar locomotive in cooperation with American Locomotive Company . The first delivery was made on 25 April 1957 , and the order completed by July . In March 1957 NSB received permission to buy another eight locomotives . Delivery started in October and was completed on 1 June 1958 . The order was supplemented with another six trains , with delivery in 1958 . 
 The Finnish State Railways ( VR ) ordered five units in 1959 , but these were cancelled for political reasons . The units were offered to NSB for a reduced price . Three were designated Di 3b because they had a slight specification variation , with a ( A1A ) ' ( A1A ) ' wheel arrangement and higher top speed . Two units had come short enough in the production process that they could be given the same specifications as the other Di 3a units , but received a slightly longer body . The Di 3b were given the numbers 641 – 643 . For part of 1960 , no . 623 was leased by NOHAB and sent on a demonstration tour in Eastern Europe . This resulted in an order from the Hungarian State Railways , where it became the MAV M61 . The Røros Line was upgraded and the Bergen Line units transferred to Trondheim in 1960 , but increased need for hauling forced NSB to not use the units on the Røros Line until the delivery of the next batch of six units in 1965 . The final delivery , of four units , was made in 1969 . 
 = = Operation = = 
 The initial use for the Di 3 was to operate the three non @-@ electrified long @-@ distance lines of NSB : the Bergen Line , the Dovre Line and the Nordland Line . Following the delivery of the first batch in 1957 , they were from 2 June used on the Dovre Line , north of Otta to Trondheim , and further north along the Nordland Line to Mo i Rana . The stock was sufficient to replace all steam locomotives on the Nordland Line , and reduced travel time by one hour . From Hamar to Otta , the track did not have sufficient permitted axle load . From the second batch of eight units , five were put into service on the Bergen Line , the rest on the Dovre and Nordland Lines . Necessary upgrades of the permitted axle load had been made to the Dovre Line and Nordland Line , and the locomotives were in use from Hamar to <unk> . On 30 November , the Nordland Line was completed to Fauske , and the full length operated with Di 3 . 
 The first section of the Bergen Line , the Gjøvik Line and the Roa – Hønefoss Line , was electrified in February 1961 . This allowed diesel and electric locomotives to haul all trains from Oslo to Bergen . In 1962 the Nordland Line was completed to Bodø , but the increased need for locomotives was more than compensated by the electrification of the Bergen Line being extended to Ål . The first Di 3 ran on the Røros Line in 1964 , that had previously been denied due to bridges with insufficient axle load permits . In 1965 , the Bergen Line was electrified , and all but one Di 3 was transferred to Trondheim . A single unit , usually no . 610 , was stationed at Finse Station as a snowplow . Along with additional deliveries , there were sufficient Di 3 units to terminate most steam operations . 
 After the Bergen Line was electrified , the work continued on the Dovre Line . The section from Hamar to Otta was finished in 1967 , and the following year to Dombås . This allowed the locomotives to be transferred to secondary lines . With the final delivery of the last units in 1969 and the completion of the electrification of the Dovre Line in 1970 , the final steam locomotive was taken out of service . During the last half of the 1960s , the Di 3 was put into service on the Rauma Line , the Røros Line , the Solør Line , the Valdres Line and the Meråker Line . 
 In November 1970 , the Dovre Line was electrified , and the last steam locomotives were retired . A long @-@ term plan to electrify half the lines was finished , and for two decades , NSB 's operations were very stable with no major investments to infrastructure or closing of lines . NSB had slightly less diesel locomotives than they needed , but plans to order additional Di 3 was never fulfilled . In 1981 , NSB took delivery of five Di 4 to supplement the older units . They were mainly used on the Nordland Line , and Di 3 units were predominantly used on the other lines , although they continued to operate som trains on the Nordland Line . On 1 April 1987 , a Di 3 612 caught on fire ; the damage was small enough that it could have been repaired , but NSB instead decided to put aside the unit . At the time NSB planned to order additional Di 4 , but these plans were put on hold . In 1988 , the Valdres Line was closed ; this was the only time a line with Di 3 in regular service was closed . 
 During the 1980s , NSB started leasing SJ T44 @-@ locomotives from Sweden to supplement the Di 3 . In 1992 , the decision was made to order 12 Di 6 and 20 Di 8 to replace the Di 3 . The former was based on the Di 4 and had twice the power of the Di 3 . The Di 8 was slightly more powerful than the Di 3 , and were intended for freight trains . Both series were put into service in 1996 , but the Di 6 proved to have so many technical problems that they were returned to Siemens in 1998 . The Di 3 units had been set aside and some had been scrapped , but the return of the Di 6 forced NSB to put the units back into service . 
 During the mid @-@ 1990s , NSB had initiated a program to replace the traditional locomotive and carriage trains with new , tilting multiple units . This had led to the order of sixteen Class 73 four @-@ car units for the three mainline routes on the Bergen Line , Dovre Line and Sørland Line . To supplement this , the board of NSB decided on 14 November 1996 to purchase seven tilting diesel multiple units for the Røros and Rauma Lines . The choice fell on Class 93 , with fifteen units eventually delivered . This allowed all passenger trains on <unk> lines to either be operated with Class 93 be hauled by the Di 4 . The last Di 3 @-@ hauled train ran on 7 January 2001 . 
 = = = Post @-@ NSB = = = 
 With the delivery of Class 93 , NSB started to retire or sell the Di 3 . In November 2001 , five units were sold for NOK 250 @,@ 000 each — well under market price — to the new private operator Ofotbanen . The purchase raised controversy , because the potential operator <unk> had offered full market price for the trains . One year after delivery , six of eleven Class 93 @-@ locomotives were out of order . To solve the problem , NSB had to rent back used Di 3 locomotives from Ofotbanen . NSB had chosen to sell the old locomotives for less than market price , but Ofotbanen demanded that NSB pay the entire purchase price for the short @-@ term rental back . 
 Four units ( 619 , 633 , 641 and 643 ) were sold to the United Nations and was put into service in Kosovo , in what has since become the Kosovo Railways . Four units ( 622 , 626 , 630 and 631 ) were sold to an operator in Sicily , Italy . The Norwegian National Rail Administration bought one unit ( 628 ) for maintenance , and has painted it yellow . The Norwegian Railway Museum in Hamar has preserved three units , of which two ( 602 and 616 ) were operated by GM @-@ Gruppen and one ( 615 ) is kept for spare parts . NSB has kept one unit as reserve at Ål Station . The remaining units have been scrapped , put aside or sold as spare part units .

 The Di 3 was built by <unk> och Holm of <unk> , Sweden , as part of a series of GM EMD <unk> locomotives in Europe . They are technically similar to the DSB Class MY of Denmark and the MAV M61 of Hungary . The locomotives are powered by a 16 @-@ cylinder EMD 16 @.@ 567 C or E engine that has a power output of 1 @,@ 305 kilowatts ( 1 @,@ 750 horsepower ) at 835 revolutions per minute ( rpm ) . The engines power an EMD <unk> or D12 generator that feeds six ASEA <unk> or <unk> motors on a Di 3a . The Di 3b is equipped with four EMD <unk> or <unk> motors . This gives a tractive effort of 265 kilonewtons ( 60 @,@ 000 lbf ) for the a @-@ series and 176 @.@ 5 kilonewtons ( 39 @,@ 700 pounds @-@ force ) for the b @-@ series . The motors have a power output of 1 @,@ 100 kilowatts ( 1 @,@ 500 horsepower ) . The maximum speed is 105 kilometres per hour ( 65 mph ) for the a @-@ series and 143 kilometres per hour ( 89 miles per hour ) for the b @-@ series . 
 The steel bodies are 18 @.@ 60 or 18 @.@ 90 metres ( 61 @.@ 0 or 62 @.@ 0 ft ) long . The longer length is for the three b @-@ series units and the two a @-@ series locomotives that were made in the batch , originally intended for VR . The a @-@ series has a Co 'Co ' wheel arrangement , while the b @-@ series has a ( A1A ) ' ( A1A ) ' arrangement , where the center of the three axles on each bogie is unpowered . The wheels have a 1 @,@ 016 millimetres ( 3 ft 4 @.@ 0 in ) wheel diameter and the locomotives have a weight of 102 @.@ 0 tonnes ( 100 @.@ 4 long tons ; 112 @.@ 4 short tons ) for the a @-@ series and 103 @.@ 0 tonnes ( 101 @.@ 4 long tons ; 113 @.@ 5 short tons ) for the b @-@ series . The trains can be run in multiple with the Di 4 , Di 6 and Di 8 . All the Di 3 engines featured a bulldog nose , the only locomotive type in Norway to do so . The locomotives were at first delivered in a dark green livery , but during the 1960s this was changed to red , and the last delivered units never had a green scheme . 
 = Queen Vic Fire Week = 
 " Queen Vic Fire Week " is a group of four episodes of the BBC soap opera EastEnders , broadcast between 6 and 10 September 2010 on BBC One . The episodes included a fire at The Queen Victoria public house , also known as The Queen Vic or The Vic , and the departure of the character Peggy Mitchell , portrayed by Barbara Windsor , who left the series after sixteen years in the role . During the episodes , Peggy — the pub landlady — has her crack cocaine @-@ addicted son Phil ( Steve McFadden ) imprisoned in The Queen Victoria , forcing him to go cold turkey . She later learns that her deceased husband Archie ( Larry Lamb ) was murdered by local resident Stacey Branning ( Lacey Turner ) . Before she can report Stacey to the police , Phil escapes and sets the pub on fire . Stacey and her infant daughter Lily are trapped inside , but are rescued by Ryan Malloy ( Neil McDermott ) , prompting Stacey to reveal to him that he is Lily 's father . The pub destroyed , Peggy decides against reporting Stacey for Lily 's sake . She plans to make a fresh start , bidding her family goodbye and leaving Walford . 
 The episodes were directed by Lee Salisbury and produced by Bryan Kirkwood . The first was written by Daran Little and the remainder by Simon Ashdown . Kirkwood intended to give Windsor an " epic and poignant " departure , as befitting her status as the ultimate EastEnders matriarch . The fire storyline was created for her exit , and to facilitate a refurbishment of The Queen Victoria set for the transition to high @-@ definition television broadcasting . The episodes were filmed over seventeen days , more than twice the series ' typical filming duration , with the interior set rebuilt on the George Lucas Stage in Elstree for the fire . A special version of the theme tune , called " Peggy 's Theme " , was created for Windsor 's final episode . It was released as an EP , available for download following the episode , and features as the lead track on composer Simon May 's album The Simon May Collection . The episodes were accompanied by two documentaries on BBC Three , one following the filming of the fire , and the other examining ten of Peggy 's most iconic moments in EastEnders . 
 Viewership ranged from 8 @.@ 60 – 10 @.@ 09 million , with no episode watched by less than a third of the total viewing audience . They were the most watched programmes on BBC One in the week of broadcast , and the Friday episode was the second @-@ most watched show across all channels . The episodes received a mixed response from critics . Several highlighted inaccuracies and implausibilities in the storyline , including the lack of fire alarms and sprinklers in the pub . Others focussed on Peggy 's departure , with James McCarthy of the Western Mail writing that it would " doubtless remain the stuff of EastEnders ' legend for years to come , " and Jim Shelley calling it " a good way to go . " In contrast , the Daily Mirror 's Polly Hudson found Peggy 's exit a nonsensical " non event " , and Gareth McLean of The Guardian deemed it " suitably sentimental " , but several years overdue . The fire was nominated in the " Best Stunt " category at the 2011 All About Soap Bubble Awards .

 In October 2009 , actress Barbara Windsor 's decision to leave EastEnders after sixteen years of portraying the character Peggy Mitchell was announced . The show 's executive producer , Bryan Kirkwood , said it was a massive honour for him to be responsible for the character 's exit , but explained that as she has become the " quintessential matriarch of the show " , they had to get the exit storyline right , which he said would be " both epic and poignant " . Windsor gave one year 's notice of leaving , giving the production team time to come up with a storyline , and was asked to keep her decision a secret until the announcement was made . Kirkwood looked at Windsor 's first episode and decided her exit should be about Peggy and her son Phil , as Peggy 's arrival came at a time when Phil needed her most , and since then , she had believed that Phil still needed her . Peggy 's exit came when she realised his mother was not what Phil needed . Windsor did not want to know in advance how her character would leave , but hoped she would not be killed off . She commented : " My exit was beautifully written and I really couldn ’ t have asked for a better send @-@ off for Peggy . " 
 In June 2010 , it was announced that The Queen Victoria would be destroyed in a fire to tie in with EastEnders ' transition to high definition so the set could be completely refurbished . It was reported that the fire could tie in with the departure of Peggy or one of the several other characters whose departure had previously been announced . Director Lee Salisbury said the fire , as well as Peggy 's departure , would have a huge effect on several characters , especially the Mitchell family , of which Peggy is the matriarch . Kirkwood said the fire was " one of the most spectacular stunts that EastEnders has ever seen , and it 's very exciting . "

 = = = Filming = = = 
 All four episodes were directed by Lee Salisbury , who learned three weeks before filming that he would be working on the episodes , and said he was " a bit dumbstruck " to discover he would be directing the fire episodes and Windsor 's departure , but that he was proud to do so . He said his main aim for the fire was to show the fear , panic and pandemonium that comes when a fire starts and quickly spreads . He wanted the story to be character @-@ led rather than led by the fire , saying that the fire " almost becomes a backdrop " . Salisbury said it was hard to make the fire look real because " you can 't actually set fire to stuff " . As the fire lasted for some time , characters ' scenes could be divided up into small sections . Salisbury commented : " Bryan Kirkwood , the writer [ Ashdown ] and myself also wanted it to be an episode where things kept happening and the audience would keep thinking , ' Wow , that must have been the explosion ' or ' That must have been the stunt ' . But more things keep happening and happening , and I think that 's what people will find really shocking . " The production team had several production meetings for the weeks ' worth of episodes , whereas there is usually just one . 
 The episodes took seventeen days to film , where normally crew are given eight days to film a week 's worth of episodes . Between forty and forty @-@ five members of crew were required for filming the fire episode , including assistant directors , a design department , cameras , lighting , sound , make up , costume , visual effects , fire safety officers and a stunt team consisting of a stunt co @-@ ordinator and stunt doubles . Filming was done with four television cameras , a steadicam and a dolly . The exterior fire scenes were filmed first , in five night shoots lasting until 4 a.m. , and the real exterior set was burnt . Safety was the top priority for the fire scenes , and fire safety advisors ensured all cast and crew were protected . Stunt doubles wore flame @-@ proof gel on their faces and for the scene where Ryan and Stacey fall from the ladder , several layers of cardboard boxes were stacked on the ground for the stunt doubles to fall onto . For filming the final explosion scene , all the actors whose characters were involved were filmed separately for their reactions . The explosion had to be delayed due to a power failure at Elstree Studios , two minutes before the explosion was due to be set off , which also affected a live broadcast of Big Brother . The power cut lasted two hours and filming was further delayed due to rain . The explosion was completed in a third take . Despite the delay , the scenes were completed on schedule . Salisbury noted that the demise of such an iconic set as The Queen Victoria left several cast members in tears . 
 The interior set of The Queen Victoria pub was taken apart and rebuilt exactly to scale on the George Lucas Stage , a fire stage at Elstree Film Studios , for interior scenes , filmed over four days . The interior set took seven weeks to build and two weeks to get into the studio . Controlled gas pipes were used to shoot jets of flames and a header was specially built to collapse on Phil . Salisbury had to ensure that the fire for the interior scenes matched that of the already @-@ filmed exterior scenes . Producers decided to extend the 10 September episode featuring Peggy 's departure by ten minutes , meaning it would clash with rival soap opera Coronation Street . 
 In 2016 , Windsor said that the Queen Vic fire was her favourite stunt to film since joining the cast in 1994 . She called it her " Joan of Arc moment " and revealed that when the explosion happened , she " was actually blown off my feet and landed on Steve McFadden who ended up with bruised ribs " . 
 = = = Theme music = = = 
 Windsor 's final episode on 10 September 2010 did not end with the usual EastEnders theme tune . Instead the occasionally used " Julia 's Theme " , a piano version of the theme , was reworked specially for the broadcast , and given the name " Peggy 's Theme " . The theme was created by the original theme tune composer , Simon May , who was reportedly thrilled to write the theme tune for Windsor . He added more piano to the theme and gave it a " more melancholy feel " . May composed the theme not knowing what would happen on screen , but when Kirkwood brought a rough edit of the episode , May noted that the music fitted perfectly first time , saying it was " remarkable and very moving . " The theme features as the lead track on the album The Simon May Collection and was also released as an EP available to download immediately after the episode . He revealed : " All the actors and crew had made a really special couple of shows . My main purpose was to bring something to the table , and I didn 't think it would be a single . [ ... ] But when everybody heard the track they said ' you 've got to release that as the single because it 's something special ' . "

 A number of trailers were released to television in August 2010 to promote Peggy 's departure from the series , and a section on the official EastEnders website was dedicated to the character , allowing fans to " heart Peggy " . The 10 September episode was followed by a twenty @-@ minute episode of documentary programme EastEnders Revealed titled " Peggy Mitchell : Queen of the Vic " .

 = = = Critical response = = = 
 The fire and Peggy 's exit episodes garnered a mixed reception by critics . Liam Tucker , founder of website Watch With Mothers , compared the fire episode to the film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and admired the special effects and performances of the episode , but said that it seemed unlikely that everyone would have escaped safely , especially Stacey and her baby . Roz Laws from the Sunday Mercury wondered if the fire episode was inaccurate due to the lack of fire alarms , sprinklers and emergency lighting in the pub , but noted that the episode 's use of the song " Murder on the Dancefloor " , featuring the line " Gonna burn this god damn house right down " , was " clever " . A writer for Heat said " We knew the Vic fire was coming , but actually seeing it was quite another thing , and knowing that it also marked the end of an era with the departure of Barbra [ sic ] Windsor made it that much more emotional . " A reporter for the Nottingham Evening Post wrote " Never in the history of soap fires , of which there have of course been legion , have so many hilariously overindulgent explosions been captured on camera . " The Mail on Sunday picked the fire episode as the " Soap of the Day " , while The People deemed the lack of deaths " a wasted opportunity . " Ally Ross wrote in his column in The Sun that the fire episode was " twenty minutes of shouting " , questioned why one character was seen flouting the smoking ban and Phil was boarded up behind an inward @-@ opening door , and opined that he was glad to see Peggy leave as she had become " increasingly psychotic " and " vile " . 
 Writing for entertainment news website Digital Spy , Daniel Kilkelly said Peggy 's final episode featured " plenty of poignant moments [ ... ] — not least the scene which saw Peggy standing in the destroyed Queen Vic and appearing completely devastated . " Gareth McLean from The Guardian said the use of " Peggy 's Theme " was a " suitably sentimental sendoff " for the character , but said that " in hindsight , Peggy should have left Walford three or four years ago , her character trapped in a cycle of increasingly samey stories that reduced her to a parody of her former self " , describing her efforts to put out the flames as " like a very sooty clockwork mouse " . James McCarthy of Welsh newspaper Western Mail said Windsor 's " final emotional scene will doubtless remain the stuff of EastEnders ' legend for years to come , " and Jim Shelley from the Daily Mirror said " It was a good way to go . " However , Shelley 's colleague Polly Hudson said Peggy 's exit was a " non event " , as " Peggy just left , nonsensically and at complete odds with everything we 've learnt about her character over the last 15 years . " 
 In February 2011 , the fire was nominated for ' Best Stunt ' at the 2011 All About Soap Bubble Awards . In May , it was nominated for ' Spectacular Scene of the Year ' at the 2011 British Soap Awards . In 2015 , Inside Soap listed the Queen Vic fire as their 9th favourite soap opera stunt of all time , saying it was " just smoke and mirrors — we wanted proper carnage ! "

 Tropical Cyclone Kate was a short @-@ lived Category 2 cyclone that remained nearly stationary for its entire existence in the northwestern Coral Sea in February 2006 . Forming out of a monsoonal trough on 22 February , Kate rapidly intensified throughout the day . By 23 February , the system attained its peak intensity with winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph 10 @-@ minute sustained ) and a barometric pressure of 985 hPa ( mbar ) . Shortly thereafter , increasing wind shear caused the storm to quickly weaken . By 24 February , the system dissipated over open waters near Queensland , Australia .

The waves injured six people in Australia , although no property damage was reported .

 Cyclone Kate originated from an area of low pressure that was first identified on 22 February 2006 , within a monsoonal trough . The system rapidly intensified throughout the day , with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology issuing their first advisory on the system that evening . Upon being classified , the system was immediately declared Tropical Cyclone Kate , skipping tropical low status . At the same time , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) also began issuing advisories on the system , designating it as Tropical Cyclone 13P . The storm had developed well @-@ defined , upper @-@ level outflow enhanced by diffluence over the system . 
 The system remained nearly stationary over the northwestern Coral Sea . Early on 23 February , the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph 10 @-@ minute sustained ) and a barometric pressure of 985 hPa ( mbar ) . However , the JTWC assessed the system to have been slightly weaker , attaining peak winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph 1 @-@ minute sustained ) . Further intensification was anticipated as Kate slowly tracked towards Queensland , Australia . However , Kate stalled shortly thereafter and began to weaken due to increasing wind shear . Rapid weakening took place throughout the day , and JTWC declared the system dissipated early on 24 February . The Bureau of Meteorology downgraded Kate to a tropical low around the same time , although they continued to monitor the storm for several more hours before reporting that it had dissipated over open waters . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Upon the cyclone 's formation , the Bureau of Meteorology warned vessels to avoid the storm in anticipation of rough seas and winds gusting to 125 km / h ( 78 mph ) . Although the storm did not pose much of a threat to Queensland , officials urged residents to ensure their disaster kits were ready and that preparations for a moderate storm , such as storing lose outdoor objects and clearing gutters , had been completed . 
 While the storm had no direct impact on land , large swells affected most of the Queensland coastline . In the Shire of Noosa , six surfers sustained serious injuries after wading into turbulent waters . Waves up to 1 @.@ 8 m ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) tossed the six surfers , leaving them with injuries ranging from broken noses and fractured ankles to head wounds from surfboards . The waves also caused additional beach erosion to parts of Papua New Guinea previously impacted by Cyclone Ingrid in March 2005 .

 Metal Gear Solid is an action @-@ adventure stealth video game developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan and first published by Konami for the PlayStation in 1998 . The game was directed , produced , and co @-@ written by series creator Hideo Kojima , and serves as a sequel to the MSX2 video games Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 : Solid Snake , which Kojima also wrote and directed . 
 Metal Gear Solid follows Solid Snake , a soldier who infiltrates a nuclear weapons facility to neutralize the terrorist threat from FOXHOUND , a renegade special forces unit . Snake must liberate two hostages , the head of DARPA and the president of a major arms manufacturer , confront the terrorists , and stop them from launching a nuclear strike . Cinematic cutscenes were rendered using the in @-@ game engine and graphics , and voice acting was used throughout the entire game . 
 Metal Gear Solid was well received , shipping more than six million copies , and scoring an average of 94 / 100 on the aggregate website Metacritic . It is regarded as one of the greatest and most important games of all time , and is often seen as the game which helped popularize the stealth genre . The commercial success of the title prompted the release of an expanded version for the PlayStation and PC , titled Metal Gear Solid : Integral ; and a remake , Metal Gear Solid : The Twin Snakes was later released for the GameCube . The game has also spawned numerous sequels , prequels and spin @-@ offs , including several games , a radio drama , comics , and novels . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Despite a transition to 3D , the gameplay of Metal Gear Solid remains similar to its 2D MSX2 predecessor Metal Gear 2 : Solid Snake . The player must navigate the protagonist , Solid Snake , through the game 's areas without being detected by enemies . Detection is triggered by the player moving into an enemy 's field of vision and sets off an alarm that draws armed enemies to his location . This also triggers " alert mode " and the player must then hide and remain undetected , at which point “ evasion mode ” begins and once the counter reaches zero the game returns to " infiltration mode " where enemies are not suspicious of Snake ’ s presence . The radar cannot be used in alert or evasion mode . 
 To remain undetected , the player can perform techniques which make use of both Solid Snake 's abilities and the environment , such as crawling under objects , using boxes as cover , ducking or hiding around walls , and making noise to distract enemies . These are carried out using the third @-@ person camera , which often changes its angle to give the player the best view of the area possible , and an on @-@ screen radar , which displays enemies and their field of vision . Snake can also make use of many items and gadgets , such as infra @-@ red goggles or a cardboard box disguise . The emphasis on stealth promotes a less violent form of gameplay , as fights against large groups of enemies will often result in serious damage for the player . 
 The game 's progress is punctuated by cutscenes and codec , as well as encounters with bosses . To progress , players must discover the weaknesses of each boss and defeat them . Play controls and strategies can also be accessed via the Codec radio , where advice is delivered from Snake 's support team ; for example , the support team may chastise Snake for not saving his progress often enough , or explain his combat moves in terms of which buttons to press on the gamepad . The Codec is also used to provide exposition on the game 's backstory . Completion of the title provides the player with a statistical summary of their performance , and a " code name " based upon it , typically the name of a common animal . 
 In a first for the Metal Gear series , a training mode , called VR Mode , is available in which players can practice hiding techniques , weapon use , and sneaking . In addition to the stealth gameplay , there are set piece sequences that entail firefights between the player and enemies from the third @-@ person and first @-@ person perspectives .

 = = Plot = = 
 The year is 2005 , six years after the downfall of <unk> . A renegade genetically @-@ enhanced special forces unit , FOXHOUND , has seized a remote island in Alaska 's Fox Archipelago codenamed " Shadow Moses " , the site of a nuclear weapons disposal facility . FOXHOUND threatens to use the nuclear @-@ capable mecha , Metal Gear REX , against the U.S. government if they do not receive the remains of Big Boss and the ransom of $ 1 billion within 24 hours . Solid Snake is forced out of retirement by Colonel Roy Campbell to infiltrate the island and neutralize the threat . 
 Snake enters the facility via an air vent and locates the first hostage , DARPA Chief Donald Anderson . Anderson reveals that Metal Gear REX can be deactivated with a secret detonation override code , but dies of a heart attack . Colonel Campbell 's niece Meryl Silverburgh , held hostage in an adjoining cell , helps Snake escape . Snake locates another hostage , <unk> president Kenneth Baker , but is confronted by FOXHOUND member Revolver Ocelot . Their gunfight is interrupted by a mysterious cyborg ninja who cuts off Ocelot 's right hand . Baker briefs Snake on the Metal Gear project and advises him to contact Meryl , whom he gave a PAL card that might prevent the launch , but he too dies of a sudden heart attack . 
 Over Codec , Meryl agrees to meet in the warhead disposal area on the condition that Snake contacts Metal Gear 's designer , Dr. Hal " Otacon " Emmerich . En route , Snake receives an anonymous codec call warning him of a tank ambush . Snake fends off the attack from Vulcan Raven and proceeds to the rendezvous , where he locates Otacon . The ninja reappears and Snake realizes it is his former ally Gray Fox , believed dead . Otacon agrees to aid Snake remotely using special camouflage to procure information and supplies . 
 Snake meets Meryl and receives the PAL card . As they head for the underground base , Meryl is possessed by psychic Psycho Mantis and pulls her gun on Snake . He disarms her and defeats Mantis , who informs Snake that he has " a large place " in her heart . After they reach the underground passageway , Sniper Wolf ambushes them , wounds Meryl , and captures Snake . Liquid confirms Snake 's suspicion that they are twin brothers . After being tortured by Ocelot , Snake is confused to discover Anderson 's body in his cell , seemingly dead for days . He escapes , makes his way up the communications tower , and fends off a helicopter attack from Liquid . As he emerges onto a snowfield , he is confronted again by Sniper Wolf . He kills her , devastating Otacon , who was infatuated with her . 
 Snake continues to REX 's hangar and is ambushed again by Raven . After Snake defeats him , Raven tells Snake that " Anderson " was in fact FOXHOUND disguise artist Decoy Octopus Infiltrating Metal Gear 's hangar , Snake overhears Liquid and Ocelot preparing the REX launch sequence and uses the PAL card , but this unexpectedly activates REX . Liquid reveals that he has been impersonating Snake 's advisor Master Miller and that FOXHOUND has used Snake to facilitate REX 's launch . He and Snake are the product of the Les Enfants <unk> project , a 1970s government program to clone Big Boss . He also reveals to Snake the government 's true reason for sending him : Snake is unknowingly carrying a weaponized " FoxDie " virus that causes cardiac arrest in FOXHOUND members on contact , allowing the government to retrieve REX undamaged . 
 As Liquid , in REX , battles Snake , Gray Fox appears , destroys REX 's radome , and is killed . Snake destroys REX and defeats Liquid , then escapes with Meryl or Otacon via an underground tunnel , pursued by Liquid in a Jeep . After their vehicles crash , Liquid pulls a gun on Snake but dies from FoxDie . Colonel Campbell , briefly ousted from command , calls off a nuclear strike to destroy evidence of the operation , and has Snake registered as killed in action to stop the US government searching for him . Naomi Hunter , who injected Snake with the FoxDie virus , tells him that he has an indeterminate amount of time before it kills him . Ocelot calls the U.S. President ; he was a double agent whose mission was to steal Baker 's disk of Metal Gear specifications . 
 = = Development = = 
 Kojima initially planned the third Metal Gear game in 1994 , originally titled Metal Gear 3 , and to release it for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1994 . Conceptual artwork , by illustrator Yoji Shinkawa , of the characters Solid Snake , Meryl Silverburgh , who was also a character in the adventure game Policenauts , and the FOXHOUND team , were included in the Policenauts : Pilot Disk preceding the release of the full version of the 3DO game in 1995 . However , due to the discontinuation of the 3DO from the market , development of the game shifted to the PlayStation shortly after Policenauts was released . 
 Kojima retitled the game Metal Gear Solid , choosing this over the working title Metal Gear 3 . This was due to the fact that he believed that the first two MSX2 games were not well known at the time due to their lack of worldwide releases . He used the word ' Solid ' which was chosen due to the game being the third installment in the series , and because it uses 3D computer graphics , as well as being in reference to Solid Snake , the game 's protagonist . Sequels to this game also use the Metal Gear Solid title , and generally follow a numeral progression . 
 The development for Metal Gear Solid began in mid @-@ 1995 with the intention of creating the " best PlayStation game ever " . Developers aimed for accuracy and realism while making the game enjoyable and tense . In the early stages of development , the Huntington Beach SWAT team educated the creators with a demonstration of vehicles , weapons and explosives . Weapons expert <unk> Mori was also tapped as technical adviser in the research , which included visits to Fort Irwin and firing sessions at Stembridge Gun Rentals . Kojima stated that " if the player isn 't tricked into believing that the world is real , then there 's no point in making the game " . To fulfill this , adjustments were made to every detail , such as individually designed desks . 
 Hideo Kojima created the characters of Metal Gear Solid . Modifications and mechanics were made by conceptual artist Yoji Shinkawa . According to Shinkawa , Solid Snake 's physique in this particular installment was based on Jean @-@ Claude Van Damme , while his facial appearance was based on Christopher Walken . The characters were completed by polygonal artists using brush drawings and clay models by Shinkawa . Kojima wanted greater interaction with objects and the environment , such as allowing the player to hide bodies in a storage compartment . Additionally , he wanted " a full orchestra right next to the player " ; a system which made modifications such as tempo and texture to the currently playing track , instead of switching to another pre @-@ recorded track . Although these features could not be achieved , they were implemented in Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty . 
 Metal Gear Solid was shown to the public at E3 1997 as a short video . It was later playable for the first time at the Tokyo Game Show in 1998 and officially released the same year in Japan with an extensive promotional campaign . Television and magazine advertisements , in @-@ store samples , and demo give @-@ aways contributed to a total of $ 8 million in promotional costs . An estimated 12 million demos for the game were distributed during 1998 . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The musical score of Metal Gear Solid was composed by Konami 's in @-@ house musicians , including Kazuki <unk> , Hiroyuki Togo , <unk> Ishiyama , Lee Jeon Myung , and Maki Kirioka . Composer and lyricist Rika Muranaka provided a song called " The Best is Yet To Come " for the game 's ending credits sequence . The song is performed in Irish by Aoife Ní <unk> . The main theme was composed by <unk> <unk> from the Konami <unk> Club . 
 Music played in @-@ game has a synthetic feel with increased pace and introduction of strings during tense moments , with a looping style endemic to video games . Overtly cinematic music , with stronger orchestral and choral elements , appears in cutscenes . The soundtrack was released on September 23 , 1998 , under the King Records label .

 The English version of Metal Gear Solid , translated by Jeremy Blaustein , who localized the Sega CD version of Snatcher , contains minor refinements made during localization , such as a choice of three difficulty settings when starting a new game ( with a fourth unlockable setting available if a completed file is present ) , an alternate tuxedo outfit for Snake ( which the character wears on every third successive playthrough on the same save file ) , and a " demo theater " where the player views every cutscene and radio conversations relevant to the main story . Changes to the English script include the addition of Western sources and authors to Mei @-@ Ling 's motivational quotes ( originally the character only cited Chinese proverbs ) and the games detected by Psycho Mantis when he reads the player 's memory card ( due to certain titles such as Policenauts and the <unk> Memorial series not being released for the foreign market ) . Versions of the game dubbed in Spanish , German , French and Italian were released throughout Europe in addition to the English @-@ dubbed version released in America . A premium package was released in Japan and Asia containing the game , a T @-@ shirt , dog tags , a music CD featuring the soundtracks of the MSX2 games , and a booklet with information about the game 's production and plot . A European version of the package was also produced , featuring different content from the Japanese version . 
 The Japanese PlayStation version of Metal Gear Solid , as well as Integral , had been reissued twice : once under The Best range and second time as a PS one Books title . Likewise , the American and European versions of Metal Gear Solid were reissued under the " Greatest Hits " and " Platinum " ranges respectively . The game is included in the Japanese Metal Gear Solid : 20th Anniversary Collection set and in the American Essential Collection set . The original Metal Gear Solid was released on the PlayStation Store for download on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable in 2008 in Japan and in 2009 in North America and Europe . 
 = = = Integral = = = 
 Released on June 25 , 1999 for the PlayStation in Japan , Metal Gear Solid : Integral ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> Gia <unk> : <unk> ) is an expanded edition that features the additional content from the American and European versions of the original game . Integral replaces the Japanese voices from the original version with the English dub , while offering a choice between Japanese and English subtitles ( item descriptions , mission logs and other text are still in Japanese ) . Further additional content to the main game include an alternate " sneaking suit " outfit for Meryl ( which she wears after the player unlocks the tuxedo for Snake ) , a " Very Easy " difficulty setting where the player starts the mission armed with a suppressor @-@ equipped MP5 sub @-@ machine gun with infinite ammo ( which substitutes the <unk> rifle in the player 's inventory ) , an eight Codec frequency featuring written staff commentary ( in Japanese only ) on every area and boss encounter , hidden music tracks , an alternate game mode where the player controls Snake from a first @-@ person perspective , an option for alternate patrol routes for enemies , and a downloadable PocketStation minigame . The Torture Event was also made easier on higher difficulty levels , reducing the number of rounds to three per session in all settings . 
 In addition to the main game , Integral includes a third disc of additional content called the " VR Disc . " The VR Disc features 300 VR training missions testing the player 's sneaking and fighting skills , as well as less conventional tests , such as murder mysteries , battling giant genome soldiers , and three missions where the player controls the Cyborg Ninja . Other content include preview trailers and a " photoshoot " mode where the player takes pictures of Mei Ling and Naomi . Completing all 300 missions will unlock a concept artwork of the Metal Gear <unk> mech that would later appear in Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty . Famitsu magazine rated Metal Gear Solid : Integral a 34 out of 40 . 
 The third disc from Integral was released as a stand @-@ alone game in North America under the title of Metal Gear Solid : VR Missions on September 23 , 1999 . While the content of VR Missions are virtually identical to the VR Disc , the unlocking requirements for the Ninja missions and the photoshoot mode were changed accordingly so that they no longer required save data from the main story mission . 
 The VR Disc was also released in the PAL region as an expansion pack titled Metal Gear Solid : Special Missions on October 29 , 1999 . Unlike the Japanese and American versions , Special Missions requires a PAL copy of the original Metal Gear Solid in order to be played . This change was done since the original Metal Gear Solid was released in multiple languages in Europe and Special Missions determines the language it uses based on which version of the original game the player owns . When the Special Missions disc is loaded into the PlayStation console , the game will ask the player to switch the disc with the first disc from Metal Gear Solid in order to load voice and language data before asking the player to switch back to the Special Missions disc . This requirement renders Special Missions incompatible with PlayStation 2 consoles made prior to the <unk> @-@ 70000 model . 
 = = = PC version = = = 
 The PC version of Metal Gear Solid was released in North America , Europe and Asia in late 2000 . This version was published by Microsoft Game Studios and developed by Digital Dialect . It supports the use of a keyboard or a USB game controller with at least six buttons ( with the manual recommending the Sidewinder Game Pad Pro ) . The PC version is simply labelled Metal Gear Solid on the packaging , but the actual game uses the Metal Gear Solid : Integral logo , although it has some differences as well from the PlayStation version of Integral and lacks some of its content . The biggest change was reducing the number of discs from three to two , which was done by giving each disc two separate executable files , one for the main game ( <unk> ) and the other for the VR training portion ( <unk> ) , thus eliminating the need for a stand @-@ alone third disc . 
 One notable omission was the removal of the cutscene prior to the Psycho Mantis battle in which he reads the player 's memory card and activates the vibration function of the player 's controller if a DualShock is being used , as this scene involved the use of PlayStation @-@ specific peripherals . The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard ( regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point ) . Other omissions include the removal of the eighth Codec frequency ( 140 @.@ 07 ) , which featured written commentaries by the developers , Meryl 's alternate sneaking suit outfit , and the mission logs when loading a save file . However , the PC version adds the option to toggle moving and shooting in first @-@ person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting , and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei @-@ Ling through the use of quick saves . On the VR training portion , all 300 missions , as well as the photoshoot mode , are available from the start , although the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed . 
 Scoring 83 in Metacritic 's aggregate , the game was criticized for " graphic glitches " , the aged nature of the port , and being essentially identical to the PlayStation version . 
 = = = The Twin Snakes = = = 
 A remake of Metal Gear Solid , titled Metal Gear Solid : The Twin Snakes , was developed by Silicon Knights under the supervision of Hideo Kojima and released for the GameCube in North America , Japan , and Europe in March 2004 . While Twin Snakes was largely developed at Silicon Knights , its cutscenes were developed in @-@ house at Konami and directed by Japanese film director <unk> Kitamura , reflecting his dynamic signature style , utilizing bullet time photography and choreographed gunplay extensively . While the storyline and settings of the game were unchanged ( although a select few lines of dialog were re @-@ written more closely resembling the original Japanese version ) , a variety of gameplay features from Sons of Liberty were added such as the first person aiming and hanging from bars on walls . Another change in the English voice acting was the reduction of Mei Ling 's , Naomi 's and <unk> 's accents , as well as the recasting of Gray Fox from Greg Eagles , who still reprise the role of the DARPA chief , to Rob Paulsen . The graphics were also updated to match those of Metal Gear Solid 2 . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Metal Gear Solid was a commercial success , shipping over six million copies worldwide . It became one of the most rented games and topped sales charts in the United Kingdom . 
 The game was critically acclaimed , gaining a 93 @.@ 24 % and 94 / 100 aggregate at ratings websites GameRankings and Metacritic , respectively . The review in PlayStation Magazine declared it " the best game ever made . <unk> and unforgettable . " The review by IGN opined Metal Gear Solid came " closer to perfection than any other game in PlayStation 's action genre " and called it " beautiful , engrossing , and innovative ... in every conceivable category . " NGamer compared it to " playing a big budget action blockbuster , only better . " GamePro called it " this season 's top offering [ game ] and one game no self @-@ respecting gamer should be without , " but criticized the frame rate that " occasionally stalls the eye @-@ catching graphics " . GameSpot was critical of how easy it is for the player to avoid being seen , as well as the game 's short length , calling it " more of a work of art than ... an actual game . " Metal Gear Solid received an Excellence Award for Interactive Art at the 1998 Japan Media Arts Festival .

 Metal Gear Solid is often recognized as one of the key titles involved in popularizing the stealth game genre . The idea of the player being unarmed and having to avoid being seen by enemies rather than fight them has been used in many games since . It is also sometimes acclaimed as being a film as much as a game due to the lengthy cut scenes and complicated storyline . GameTrailers claimed that Metal Gear Solid " invented the stealth game " and IGN called it " the founder of the stealth genre " . Entertainment Weekly said it " broke new ground with ... movie @-@ style production ... and stealth @-@ driven gameplay . " The game is often considered one of the best games for the PlayStation , and was featured in best video games lists by Computer and Video Games in 2000 , by Electronic Gaming Monthly and Game Informer in 2001 , by Retro Gamer in 2004 , by GameFAQs and GamePro in 2005 , and by Famitsu , and by Entertainment Weekly and GameTrailers in 2006 . 
 In 2002 , IGN ranked it as the best PlayStation game ever , stating that just the demo for the game had " more gameplay [ in it ] than in most finished titles . " IGN also gave it the " Best Ending " and " Best Villain " awards . In 2005 , in placing it 19th on their list of " Top 100 Games " , they said that it was " a game that truly felt like a movie . " Guinness World Records awarded Metal Gear Solid with a record for the " Most Innovative Use of a Video Game Controller " for the boss fight with Psycho Mantis in the Guinness World Records Gamer 's Edition 2008 edition . In 2010 , PC Magazine ranked it as seventh in the list of most influential video games of all time , citing its influence on " such stealthy titles as Assassin 's Creed and Splinter Cell . " In 2012 , Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time and G4tv ranked it as the 45th top video game of all time . According to 1UP.com , Metal Gear Solid 's cinematic style continues to influence modern action games such as Call of Duty . Metal Gear Solid , along with its sequel , Metal Gear Solid 2 , was featured in the Smithsonian American Art Museum 's exhibition The Art of Video Games in 2012 . In September 2015 , Metal Gear Solid was voted the best original PlayStation game of all time by users .

 Director Hideo Kojima confirmed in 2006 that a film adaptation of Metal Gear Solid was in development . He also hinted that the movie may be set in Alaska , the original setting for the game . Despite pitching his ideas regarding the movie , the voice of Solid Snake , David Hayter , will not be writing the final script , appearing in the movie or directing the film . However , a petition has been started by fans to get Hayter involved in writing the script . The movie 's producers hoped to invite Kurt Wimmer to write the movie , but the final decision has not yet been announced , but producer Michael DeLuca dismissed the claim .

 Delaware Route 26 ( DE 26 ) is a state highway in Sussex County , Delaware . The route 's western terminus is at an intersection with Maryland Route 353 ( MD 353 ) and DE / MD 54 at the Maryland border south of Gumboro and its eastern terminus is at a dead end on the Atlantic Ocean in Bethany Beach , even though signage ends at the DE 1 intersection . The route passes through rural areas of southeastern Sussex County along with the communities of Dagsboro , Millville , Ocean View and Bethany Beach . DE 26 intersects DE 30 and DE 54 in the Gumboro area , U.S. Route 113 ( US 113 ) and DE 20 in Dagsboro , and DE 17 west of Millville . The road was built as a state highway in various stages during the 1920s and 1930s . By 1936 , DE 26 was assigned onto its current alignment . 
 = = Route description = = 
 DE 26 begins at the Maryland border at an intersection where DE / MD 54 runs west along the state line and MD 353 continues south into Maryland . From the state line , DE 26 heads northeast on two @-@ lane undivided Millsboro Highway concurrent with DE 54 . The two routes pass through agricultural areas with some woods and homes , intersecting DE 30 . At this point , DE 30 turns northeast to form a concurrency with DE 26 / DE 54 . The road curves north and heads into the residential community of Gumboro , where DE 54 turns to the east . DE 26 / DE 30 leaves Gumboro and continues back into areas of farms and forests with occasional residences . 
 In Shaft Ox Corner , DE 26 splits from DE 30 by turning east onto Nine Foot Road . The route continues east through rural land to an intersection with US 113 . Past this intersection , the road becomes Clayton Street and enters Dagsboro , passing homes and businesses and crossing Norfolk Southern 's Indian River Secondary railroad line . In the center of Dagsboro , DE 26 comes to an intersection with DE 20 , at which point it turns south to form a concurrency with DE 20 on Main Street . The two routes curve east and leave town on Vines Creek Road . 
 Upon leaving Dagsboro , the road passes to the south of Prince George 's Chapel and DE 20 splits from DE 26 by heading southeast on Armory Road . DE 26 continues east on Vines Creek Road , passing through a mix of farmland and woodland with some residential and commercial development . The route turns southeast and comes to the community of Clarksville , where it turns east onto Atlantic Avenue . Farther along , the road comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of DE 17 . After the DE 17 junction , DE 26 continues into Millville and runs through residential and commercial areas . The road continues east through Ocean View before it crosses the Assawoman Canal into Bethany Beach and becomes Garfield Parkway . The road gains a center left @-@ turn lane and intersects DE 54 Alt. before coming to a junction with DE 1 , at which point DE 26 signage ends . DE 26 officially continues east on four @-@ lane divided Garfield Parkway through the commercial center of Bethany Beach , ending at a dead end at the Atlantic Ocean . 
 DE 26 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 16 @,@ 225 vehicles at Central Avenue intersection in Ocean View to a low of 3 @,@ 837 vehicles at the west end of the DE 20 concurrency in Dagsboro . None of DE 26 is part of the National Highway System .

 By 1920 , what is now DE 26 existed as an unimproved county road . The route was upgraded to a state highway between present @-@ day US 113 and Dagsboro and from Millville to just west of the Assawoman Canal by 1924 . A year later , the road was completed as a state highway between Gumboro and Mission and between Dagsboro and Vines Creek , with the route between the Maryland border and Gumboro and the incomplete sections between Dagsboro and Bethany Beach proposed as a state highway . The proposed segments were completed by 1931 . In 1932 , the state highway between Shaft Ox Corner and Dagsboro was completed . DE 26 was assigned to its current alignment between the Maryland border south of Gumboro and Bethany Beach , where it intersected the southern terminus of DE 14 ( now part of DE 1 ) , by 1936 . In 2014 , work began to widen DE 26 between Clarksville and the Assawoman Canal from a two @-@ lane road to a three @-@ lane road with a center left @-@ turn lane and bike lanes in order to reduce traffic congestion .

 The Stripped Mixes ( released on CD for a limited time as The Motown 50 Mixes ) , is a collection of American recording artist and former Jackson 5 member Michael Jackson 's classic songs . The songs featured on the album are mainly from Jackson 's career as a member of the Jackson 5 from the 1960s to the 1980s ; songs credited to Jackson as a solo artist are from his albums during his Motown @-@ era . Other songs included on the album are " stripped " mixes of Jackson material , meaning the songs are of a quieter tone and most of the drums have been removed . 
 Following a surge in Jackson 's popularity after his death in June 2009 , it was confirmed on July 7 , that The Stripped Mixes would be released . The album was made available as a digital download on July 7 , 2009 , and as a CD on July 28 . A remixed song , entitled " I 'll Be There ( Minus Mix ) " , was released on iTunes to promote the album on June 9 , 2009 , prior to Jackson 's death . The Stripped Mixes was the second Jackson compilation album to be posthumously released , the first being The Collection ; which was released over two weeks prior . The Stripped Mixes received mixed reviews from music critics . The album was a moderate commercial success worldwide and had a better chart performance internationally than in the United States .

 Due to the high popularity of a State Farm Insurance commercial featuring an acoustic version of the hit " I 'll Be There " , Motown released " I 'll Be There ( Minus Mix ) " via iTunes on June 9 , 2009 , as a prelude to The Stripped Mixes . " I 'll Be There ( Minus Mix ) " did not chart on any music charts . Shortly after Jackson 's death in June 2009 , his music experienced a surge in popularity , leading to re @-@ issues of his music . Less than an hour after the memorial service for Jackson at the Staples Center on July 7 , 2009 , Universal Music Group announced The Stripped Mixes , a collection of Jackson 's classic songs , would be released . The album features " stripped " mixes of Jackson 's classic Motown @-@ era songs as well as songs recorded while he was a member of The Jackson 5 from the 1960s to the 1980s . The songs that are " stripped " on the album have backing instruments and some studio engineering removed to make the songs have a more acoustic sound . The Stripped Mixes was made available as a digital download on July 7 , and as a compact disc on July 28 , 2009 .

 The Stripped Mixes received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics . Writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave The Stripped Mixes two out of five stars , stating that he felt that " the logic of what is left behind doesn 't quite make sense " , pointing out that " I Want You Back " and " ABC " have no drums and " feel a little tipsy and top @-@ heavy " ; " Ben " and " With a Child 's Heart " have echoes of strings in the background , making it hard to identify the songs as being " stripped " . He added that since the genius lies in the arrangements , " having so much of the arrangement absent " means that the music " just sounds awkward and incomplete , as if it was waiting for the final round of mixing and overdubs . " Erlewine 's overall opinion on the album was " if the purpose of this disc is to draw attention to Michael 's vocals , The Stripped Mixes does its job , but just because his voice is pushed front and center does not mean that this is the best place to appreciate his genius .

 A writer for PR Newswire praised the album , describing it as " showcasing " Jackson 's vocal talent and viewed The Stripped Mixes as shining a " bright , fresh light " on Jackson 's early career as both a solo artist and with his brothers in The Jackson 5 . Natalie Salvo of <unk> commented that the mix of " Ain 't No Sunshine " made the album " personally " worth buying . She added that " the music does what it 's supposed to do " , which was " evoking the right mood but not being overly showy . " Despite the praise , she did state that the album could be clinically looked at as an " element of bad taste " from a " greedy record company " and noted that it was " difficult " to " stop yourself being overcome with cynicism towards this album " . Jeff <unk> of Tone Publications described all of the album 's tracks as being " quite strong " and added that " regardless of your interest in Michael Jackson " the The Stripped Mixes is a disc " you should have in your collection " because it offers a " rare look " at " classic " material by Jackson when he was just beginning his career .

 = Sir William Gordon @-@ Cumming , 4th Baronet = 
 Sir William Alexander Gordon Gordon @-@ Cumming , 4th Baronet ( 20 July 1848 – 20 May 1930 ) was a Scottish landowner , soldier , adventurer and socialite . A notorious womaniser , he is best known for being the central figure in the royal baccarat scandal of 1891 . After inheriting a baronetcy he joined the Army and saw service in South Africa , Egypt and the Sudan ; he served with distinction and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel . Something of an adventurer , he also spent time hunting in the US and India . 
 A friend of Edward , Prince of Wales for over 20 years , in 1891 he attended a house party at Tranby Croft , Yorkshire , where he took part in a game of baccarat at the behest of the prince . During the course of two nights ' play he was accused of cheating , which he denied vehemently . After news of the affair leaked out , he sued five members of the host family for slander , with the Prince of Wales called as a witness during the ensuing trial . The case was a public spectacle , widely reported in the UK and abroad . Knowledgeable commentators of the day , and subsequently , sided with Gordon @-@ Cumming , but the judgement went against him and he was ostracized from polite society . 
 A handsome , arrogant man , Gordon @-@ Cumming was a womanizer , particularly with married women . After the court case he married an American heiress ; the couple had five children , but it was an unhappy relationship . He was the grandfather of the writers Katie Fforde and Jane Gordon @-@ Cumming . 
 = = Early life = = 
 William Gordon Gordon @-@ Cumming was born on 20 July 1848 at Sanquhar House , near Forres , Morayshire . His parents were Alexander Penrose Gordon @-@ Cumming and his wife Anne Pitcairn née Campbell ( died 1888 ) . The big @-@ game hunter <unk> George Gordon @-@ Cumming was his uncle ; and the travel writer Constance Gordon @-@ Cumming was his aunt . He was educated at Eton and Wellington colleges . 
 At the age of eighteen he inherited the baronetcy and became chief of the Clan Cumming ; his line had been traced from the fourth century , through Charlemagne . His inheritance included three Morayshire estates : <unk> near Forres , Gordonstoun near Elgin and Dallas . Though the estates totalled 38 @,@ 500 acres ( 156 km2 ) , they yielded poor revenues ; the annual income from the estates in around 1890 has been described as either £ 60 @,@ 000 or £ 80 @,@ 000 .

 Although Gordon @-@ Cumming suffered from asthma and was blind in one eye , he purchased an ensign 's commission in the Scots Fusilier Guards ( later the Scots Guards ) in 1868 ( dated from 25 December 1867 ) . He was promoted to regimental lieutenant and to the rank of captain in the army by purchase on 17 May 1871 , the last year commissions were allowed to be purchased . He volunteered for service in South Africa in the Anglo @-@ Zulu War , where he served gallantly , and was the first man to enter Cetshwayo 's kraal after the Battle of Ulundi ( 1879 ) . That year he conveyed the condolences of the army to the Empress Eugénie on the death of her son , Napoléon , Prince Imperial . 
 Gordon @-@ Cumming was promoted to the regimental rank of captain and the army rank of lieutenant @-@ colonel on 28 July 1880 . He went on to serve in Egypt , in the Anglo @-@ Egyptian War ( 1882 ) and in the Sudan in the Mahdist War ( 1884 – 85 ) , the last of which was with the Guards Camel Regiment in the Desert Column . He was promoted to regimental major on 23 May 1888 . 
 He also found time for independent adventure , hunting in the Rocky Mountains in the U.S. and in India , where he would stalk tigers on foot ; in 1871 he published an account of his travels in India , Wild Men & Wild Beasts . Scenes in camp and jungle . 
 = = Royal baccarat scandal = = 
 In September 1890 Gordon @-@ Cumming was invited , along with Edward , Prince of Wales , to a house party at Tranby Croft in Yorkshire . There he was accused of cheating at baccarat by placing additional counters onto his stake after the hand had finished , but before the stake had been paid — a method of cheating known in casinos as la <unk> . Gordon @-@ Cumming insisted they had been mistaken , and explained that he played the coup de trois system of betting , in which if he won a hand with a £ 5 stake , he would add his winnings to the stake , together with another £ 5 , as the stake for the next hand . 
 In order to avoid a scandal involving the prince , he gave way to pressure from the attendant royal courtiers to sign a statement undertaking never to play cards again in return for a pledge that no @-@ one present would speak of the incident again . 
 " In consideration of the promise made by the gentlemen whose names are subscribed to preserve my silence with reference to an accusation which has been made in regard to my conduct at baccarat on the nights of Monday and Tuesday the 8th and 9th at Tranby Croft , I will on my part solemnly undertake never to play cards again as long as I live . " 
 Despite the pledge of silence , rumours of the incident began to circulate and were brought to Gordon @-@ Cumming 's attention . In an attempt to scotch the rumours , he demanded a retraction from five of the house party ; when that was not forthcoming , with no withdrawal forthcoming , on 6 February 1891 , Gordon @-@ Cumming issued writs for slander against the five , claiming £ 5 @,@ 000 against each of them . 
 The trial opened on 1 June 1891 and entry to the court was by ticket only . The Prince of Wales was present , and sat on a red leather chair on a raised platform between the judge and the witness box ; his appearance was the first time since 1411 that an heir to the throne had appeared involuntarily in court . 
 The trial closed the following week , after the judge 's summing up " had been unacceptably biased " , according to Tomes . The jury deliberated for only 13 minutes before finding in favour of the defendants ; their decision was greeted by prolonged hissing from some members of the galleries . The day after judgement was passed , the leader in The Times stated that " He is ... condemned by the verdict of the jury to social extinction . His brilliant record is wiped out and he must , so to speak , begin life again . Such is the inexorable social rule ... He has committed a mortal offence . Society can know him no more . " 
 Gordon @-@ Cumming 's senior counsel , the Solicitor General Sir Edward Clarke , remained convinced in his client and , in his 1918 memoirs , wrote that " I believe the verdict was wrong , and that Sir William Gordon @-@ Cumming was innocent " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As a result of the scandal , Gordon @-@ Cumming was dismissed from the army the day after the trial , and he resigned his membership of his four London clubs , the Carlton , Guards ' , Marlborough and Turf . 
 The same day he married his American fiancée , the heiress Florence Garner , who had stood by him throughout the trial despite Gordon @-@ Cumming twice offering to break off their engagement because of the scandal . The service took place at the Holy Trinity church in Chelsea with only a small congregation . When the couple returned to Scotland a few days later the locals from near his estate had decorated the station and pulled the carriage through the streets by hand . According to the former Lord Chancellor , Michael Havers , the lawyer Edward Grayson and the historian Peter Shankland , " That the prince and society considered him a social outcast mattered not at all to his people " . The prince was determined Gordon @-@ Cumming should remain ostracised and he " declined to meet anyone who henceforth acknowledged the Scottish baronet " . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Gordon @-@ Cumming remained outside high society for the remainder of his life . He later told his daughter that " among a host of acquaintances I thought I had perhaps twenty friends . Not one of them ever spoke to me again " . Others of his friends only relented after the death of the prince , who was by that stage King Edward VII . 
 Gordon @-@ Cumming and his wife had three sons and two daughters between 1892 and 1904 . In 1905 Florence 's fortune slumped and the couple were compelled to let or close up the houses on the Scottish estates and to move to Bridge House , Dawlish , Devon with a reduced household . Gordon @-@ Cumming managed to disguise his contempt for the middle class society to which he was now limited so that he could continue to indulge himself in golf , croquet , billiards , cricket , bridge and collecting post marks . He also enjoyed his own company , and that of his dogs and pet monkey . He hated Dawlish and considered his wife a " fat little <unk> " , unapologetically engaging in chronic infidelity . Florence lost no opportunity to remind him who funded their life but eventually herself resorted to alcohol abuse ; the couple had effectively separated before she died in 1922 . 
 In 1916 Gordon @-@ Cumming ensured that the Labour Party politician Ramsay MacDonald had his membership rescinded from the Moray Golf Club because of the latter 's opposition to the First World War . 
 Gordon @-@ Cumming died on 20 May 1930 at his <unk> home at the age of 81 . He was succeeded in his title by his eldest son , Major Alexander Penrose Gordon @-@ Cumming , MC .

 Gordon @-@ Cumming 's biographer , Jason Tomes , thought that his subject possessed " audacity and wit [ and ] gloried in the sobriquet of the most arrogant man in London " , while Sporting Life described him as " possibly the most handsome man in London , and certainly the rudest " . Gordon @-@ Cumming also owned a house in Belgravia , London ; he was a friend of the Prince of Wales , and would lend the premises to the prince for assignations with the royal mistresses . 
 Gordon @-@ Cumming was a womaniser , and stated that his aim was to " perforate " members of " the sex " . His preference was for uncomplicated relationships with married women , and he admitted that " all the married women try me " ; his liaisons included Lillie Langtry , Sarah Bernhardt and Lady Randolph Churchill . In 1890 , three days before the events at Tranby Croft , the Prince of Wales returned early from travelling in Europe ; he visited Harriet Street where he found his mistress , Daisy , Lady Brooke " in Gordon @-@ Cumming 's arms " , which soured the relationship between the two men . 
 After Gordon @-@ Cumming 's death in 1930 , his house at Gordonstoun was obtained by Kurt Hahn , who turned it into the eponymous school . It has been attended by Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , and his three sons , Charles , Andrew and Edward . 
 Two of Gordon @-@ Cumming 's granddaughters , Katie Fforde and Jane Gordon @-@ Cumming , became writers . 
 = Lycoperdon echinatum = 
 Lycoperdon echinatum , commonly known as the spiny puffball or the spring puffball , is a type of puffball mushroom in the genus Lycoperdon . The saprobic species has been found in Africa , Europe , Central America , and North America , where it grows on soil in deciduous woods , glades , and pastures . It has been proposed that North American specimens be considered a separate species , Lycoperdon americanum , but this suggestion has not been followed by most authors . Molecular analysis indicates that L. echinatum is closely related to the puffball genus Handkea . 
 The fruit bodies of L. echinatum are 2 – 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) wide by 2 – 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 4 in ) tall , supported by a small base , and densely covered with spines that are up to 0 @.@ 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 in ) long . The spines can fall off in maturity , leaving a net @-@ like pattern of scars on the underlying surface . Initially white in color , the puffballs turn a dark brown as they mature , at the same time changing from nearly round to somewhat flattened . Young specimens of L. echinatum resemble another edible spiny puffball , Lycoperdon <unk> , but the latter species does not turn brown as it ages . The fruit bodies are edible when young , when the interior is white and firm and before it has turned into a powdery brown mass of spores . Laboratory tests have shown that extracts of the fruit bodies can inhibit the growth of several bacteria that are pathogenic to humans . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The species was first described by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1797 . It was later reduced to a variety of Lycoperdon gemmatum ( as L. gemmatum var. echinatum ; L. gemmatum is now known as Lycoperdon perlatum ) by Elias Magnus Fries , but American mycologist Charles Horton Peck , who extensively studied the North American distribution of the genus , raised it again to species level in 1879 . He thought it worthy of status as a species distinct from L. gemmatum because of the different character of its warts , its much <unk> appearance , and the smoother surface of the peridium underneath the spines . Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome wrote of the fungus in 1871 , but believed their specimen , collected from Reading , Berkshire , by Hoyle , represented a new species , which they called Lycoperdon <unk> . They wrote that their specimen agreed " exactly with an authentic specimen of Persoon 's L. echinatum externally , who could , however , scarcely have overlooked the lilac spores . " Despite the apparent difference in spore color , L. <unk> is currently considered synonymous with L. echinatum . <unk> echinata , named by Lucien Quélet in 1873 , is another synonym for L. echinatum . 
 In 1972 , Vincent <unk> described the species Lycoperdon americanum on the basis of a specimen found in North Carolina . Although he believed it to be a unique species , several authors consider it synonymous with L. echinatum . Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence and secondary structure of the ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) genes coding for the internal transcribed spacer units suggests that Lycoperdon echinatum forms a clade with the puffball genus Handkea , separate from the type species of Lycoperdon , Lycoperdon perlatum . In previous analyses that used only the rRNA sequences for phylogenetic comparison , L. echinatum formed a clade with L. <unk> , L. <unk> , and Bovistella <unk> ( now known as Lycoperdon <unk> ) , but separate from L. pyriforme . 
 The species is commonly known as the " spiny puffball " or the " spring puffball " ; Peck referred to the species as the " <unk> puff @-@ ball " . The specific epithet echinatum is derived from the Greek word <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " hedgehog " or " sea @-@ urchin " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies of L. echinatum are 2 – 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) wide by 2 – 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 4 in ) tall , and are roughly spherical , or pear @-@ shaped . The exterior surface is crowded with spines that may be up to 0 @.@ 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 in ) long . According to Curtis Gates Lloyd , American specimens have more slender spines than European ones . Initially white and becoming dark brown in maturity , the spines are often joined at the tips in groups of three or four . In this form the puffballs resemble acorn caps of burr oak , with which they may readily be confused . The spines slough off in age , revealing a somewhat net @-@ like or reticulated surface . The fruit body has a small base that is an off @-@ white or purple @-@ gray color , and it may be attached to the growing surface by thin white cords ( rhizomorphs ) . The internal contents of the puffball contain the gleba , a mass of spores and associated spore @-@ producing cells . In young specimens the gleba is white and firm , but as the puffball ages , it turns yellowish and then brown to purple @-@ brown and powdery . Mature specimens develop a pore at the top of the fruit body through which spores are released when hit by falling raindrops . 
 The spores of L. echinatum , roughly spherical with warts on the surface , have diameters between 4 and 6 µm . The capillitia ( coarse thick @-@ walled hyphae in the gleba ) are elastic , brown in color , contain small pores , and are 5 – 8 µm thick . The basidia ( the spore @-@ bearing cells ) may be attached to two to four spores , and the sterigmata ( tapered spine @-@ like projections from the basidia that attach the spores ) are up to 5 µm long . 
 Like most other puffball species , L. echinatum is edible when still young and while the gleba is still white and firm . Consumption of older specimens with a non @-@ white gleba , or where the gleba has turned into a powdery spore mass , may cause stomach upsets . This species has a mild taste , and no distinguishable odor , although one source describes the smell of dried fruit bodies as similar to " old ham " . One source notes that it is " well flavoured and tender when cooked " , while another describes the texture ( of edible puffballs in general ) as " somewhat like French toast " . Antonio Carluccio recommends sautéeing puffballs with other mushrooms . To avoid possible confusion with potentially deadly Amanita species , it is recommended to slice young puffballs with a longitudinal cut to ensure that the flesh is devoid of any internal structures . 
 = = Similar species = = 
 Lycoperdon <unk> closely resembles L. echinatum , but its spines are stouter , do not turn brown in age , and the surface of the fruit body underneath the spines is smooth , not pitted . Alexander H. Smith noted that in youth , they are " difficult if not impossible to distinguish from each other , but this will cause no inconvenience to those collecting for the table , since both are edible . " In some areas the two species appear to intergrade , as specimens may be found whose spines turn brown but do not fall off . Young specimens of L. <unk> may also be difficult to distinguish from L. echinatum , but the former has a smooth outer surface when mature , and has spores attached to a pedicel ( a narrow extension of the basidium on which the sterigmata and spores are formed ) that is about 4 – 5 times as long as the spore . Lycoperdon <unk> , found only in New Zealand , also resembles L. echinatum in appearance , but differs in having smaller spores , capillitia that are hyaline ( translucent ) and septate ( with partitions that divide the capillitia into compartments ) . 
 = = Habitat , distribution , and ecology = = 
 Lycoperdon echinatum can be found either solitary or in small groups . It typically grows on the ground in deciduous forests and grassy areas , glades and pastures , on moss , humus , or woody debris . The fungus has been noted to have a preference for beech woods . Fruit bodies may make their appearance anytime from the late spring to autumn . Older specimens are more likely to be overlooked , as their brown color blends into the surrounding environment of dead leaves and dead wood . The puffball is used by various species of scuttle flies ( family Phoridae ) as larval food . 
 This species has been collected from eastern central Africa , China , Costa Rica , Iran , Japan , and Europe ( including Britain , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Finland , Germany , Italy , Slovakia , Spain , Sweden , and Switzerland ) . In North America , it is " locally frequent " east of the Rocky Mountains . 
 It is considered a threatened species in the Åland Islands of Finland . A study of the species ' distribution in Sweden reported that in the 1940s and 50s , it grew in beech woods with broad @-@ leaved grasses and herbs in <unk> with soil pH levels between 5 @.@ 0 and 6 @.@ 6 , but the populations have since decreased owing to soil acidification during the last several decades . Fruit bodies collected near arsenic @-@ contaminated sites have been shown to bioaccumulate arsenic , largely in the form of <unk> . 
 = = Antimicrobial activity = = 
 Using a standard laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility , methanol @-@ based extracts of Lycoperdon <unk> fruit bodies were shown in a 2005 study to have " significant " antibacterial activity against various human pathogenic bacteria , including Bacillus subtilis , Escherichia coli , Salmonella typhimurium , Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pyogenes , and Mycobacterium smegmatis . An earlier study ( 2000 ) had identified weak antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus . Although the specific compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity have not been identified , chemical analysis confirms the presence of terpenoids , a class of widely occurring organic chemicals that are being investigated for their potential use as antimicrobial drugs . 
 = Speak Now ( song ) = 
 " Speak Now " is a song by American singer @-@ songwriter Taylor Swift . The song , written and produced by Swift with Nathan Chapman , was released as a promotional single on October 5 , 2010 , by Big Machine Records from her 2010 album of the same name . Swift wrote the song about interrupting a wedding , after conversing with her friend , whose ex @-@ boyfriend would soon wed to someone else , and having a dream about one of her own ex @-@ boyfriends marrying another girl . The song relies on acoustic guitar and is a narration from the perspective of a person who crashes her former love 's wedding in attempt to win him back . 
 The song opened to critical acclaim for its lyrical detail . " Speak Now " had successful commercial outcomes in Canada and the United States , debuting and peaking at number eight on both the Canadian Hot 100 and the Billboard Hot 100 . Its appearance on the Billboard Hot 100 marked Swift 's sixth top ten debut , which made her the artist with the most top ten debuts in the history of the chart . " Speak Now " also managed to garner enough airplay to chart on the Hot Country Songs chart . 
 = = Background = = 
 " Speak Now " was written by Swift , as were all the tracks for the album . The song was inspired by the story of her friend and her high school boyfriend . The couple went their separate ways after high school – with the idea that they would get back together . One day , Swift 's friend informed Swift that her high school boyfriend would soon wed . " He had met this girl who 's just this horrible , mean person who made him completely stop talking to all of his friends , cut off his family . She had him so completely isolated , " said Swift . She asked her friend if she would " speak now . " Perplexed , her friend asked for an explanation , and she answered , " You know , storm the church . ' Speak now or forever hold your peace . ' I 'll go with you . I 'll play guitar . It 'd be great . " Swift 's friend found this to be humorous , laughing at the idea . 
 After speaking with her friend , Swift became deeply fixated on the idea of how tragic it would be for the person one loved to wed someone else . That night , Swift experienced a dream where one of her own ex @-@ boyfriends married another girl . To her , this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding . In retrospect , she concluded , " For me , I like to think of it as good versus evil . And this girl is just completely – just the evil one . " Swift entitled the album after " Speak Now " because it fit the album 's concept , with each song being a different confession to a person . " It 's called Speak Now , and that pertains to the album as a concept and as an entire theme of the record more than I can even tell you , " she said . The song was released as a promotional single on October 5 , 2010 , as part of Countdown to Speak Now , an exclusive campaign launched by the iTunes Store . During the opening week of Speak Now , Swift performed " Speak Now " on the Late Show with David Letterman .

 " Speak Now " is a country pop track with a length of four minutes and two seconds . It has a predominant pop music composition , intertwined with various country elements . The song is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute . It is written in the key of G major and Swift 's vocals span two octaves , from A3 to D5 . Swift 's vocals begin in a hushed tone , gradually turn grow , and at one point belt the song 's title . The song features different twangy , up @-@ and @-@ down vocal hooks might , in similarity to " You Belong with Me " . It follows the chord progression G – D – Am – C. The song 's instrumentation is based on acoustic guitar ; it eventually has its own gentle solo . 
 In the lyrics of " Speak Now " , Swift narrates about crashing her former love 's wedding in attempt to win him back . The opening lines acknowledge that , although out of character , Swift is still in love with her ex @-@ boyfriend and wants to make sure he does not marry the wrong girl . Throughout the song 's verses , Swift sneaks in the wedding and describes her observations , such as the bride @-@ to @-@ be 's bearing of a <unk> wedding gown , her cumulative family , and an organist playing " Bridal Chorus " . In " Speak Now " ' s refrains , Swift pleads her ex @-@ boyfriend to not say his vows in order to run away with her .

He concluded that he was unable to stop playing the song after he heard it . Bill Lamb of About.com said the song was " brilliant " . He continued , " The song is sweet , funny , bratty , and edgy all at the same time . Taylor Swift remains one of our most gifted young lyricists . " Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine thought that " Speak Now " exemplified Swift 's inability to " write authoritatively about anything other than how great boys are or how much boys suck or how dreams about boys will take her somewhere better than where she is now .

 = American Water Spaniel = 
 The American Water Spaniel , ( often abbreviated to AWS ) , is a breed of spaniel which is one of a small number of breeds originating in the United States . Developed in the state of Wisconsin during the 19th century from a number of other breeds , including the Irish and English Water Spaniels . The breed was saved by Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer , who set up the breed club and standard , and whose work led to recognition for the breed by the United Kennel Club , and later , the American Kennel Club . While they are the state dog of Wisconsin , they remain a rare breed . 
 They are medium @-@ sized dog , and have a double layered coat , which comes in a variety of brown related shades . A versatile hunting dog , they are also suitable for apartment life due to work by breeders to develop a breed with an even temperament . The AWS may have been involved in the development of the Boykin Spaniel . 
 = = History = = 
 Developed in the United States , the American Water Spaniel is the Wisconsin state dog . The breed originated in the areas along the Fox River and its tributary the Wolf River during the early 19th century . Hunters needed a dog that could work on both land and water , a versatile hunter skilled at bringing in a variety of game . Hunters also wanted a hunting dog compact enough to be transported in a small skiff , one that was able to withstand Wisconsin 's cold water temperatures . Breeds involved in the creation of the American Water Spaniel are thought to have included the English Water Spaniel , Irish Water Spaniel , Curly Coated Retriever , native Indian Dogs , the Poodle , and either the Sussex Spaniel or another type of field spaniel . 
 This little brown dog created was known at the time as the American Brown Spaniel , and weighed around 40 pounds ( 18 kg ) . It had a thick curly coat that protected it from the cold temperatures of the water and winter . It was used to hunt waterfowl , Ruffed Grouse , Greater Prairie Chicken and a variety of fur – bearing animals . 
 Over the years the numbers of the breed began to dwindle due both to a reduction in the duck population through those valley areas , and because of a switch in hunting – from a means to gather food for survival to that of recreation . Additionally , following World War II , new types of dogs became available in Wisconsin such as setters , pointers and other spaniels , allowing additional specialization in hunting . 
 Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer , from New London , Wisconsin , set up Wolf River Kennels in order to save the breed . Numbers held by the kennel fluctuated but at times went up to 132 dogs . He advertised the dogs widely across the country , selling male dogs for $ 25 and females dogs for $ 20 . Part of a sales pitch that Pfeifer mailed to prospective dog owners read , " The American Brown Spaniel is distinctively an American production . Hunters have known this type for years and it was through their efforts that this dog was propagated .... For years we have bred only selective stock , breeding for <unk> , stability , courage , intelligence , and beauty . They are dogs to admire and trust under all conditions whether in the home circle or in the field with the outdoor man . " 
 Due to Pfeifer 's work , the breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club ( UKC ) as the American Water Spaniel in 1920 , and by the Field Dog Stud Book in 1938 . Dr. Pfeifer 's own dog , named " Curly Pfeifer " was the first American Water Spaniel to be registered with UKC . John Scofield of Missouri and Thomas <unk> of Rush Lake , Wisconsin worked together with the American Water Spaniel Club ( AWSC ) , gaining the breed recognition with the American Kennel Club ( AKC ) in 1940 . Prior to recognition by the AKC , the breed had not been shown in the show ring before . 
 The breed has links to the Boykin Spaniel , and is thought to have been the main breed used to develop the Boykin . The differences between the Boykin and the AWS are negligible with some dog historians suggesting that the original Boykin , called " <unk> " , who was found on the streets of Spartanburg , South Carolina , was actually an American Water Spaniel who had been misplaced in transit . However the breed clubs for the Boykin do not agree with this account . 
 The breed was made the state dog of Wisconsin in 1985 . The American Water Spaniel remains a rare breed . During 1998 only 233 puppies were registered with the AKC , with an estimated 3 @,@ 000 dogs in existence mostly around the Midwestern United States , in particular in Wisconsin , Minnesota and Michigan . In 2010 , the breed was ranked 143rd most popular breed in the United States , out of 167 breeds . This is a decrease since 2000 , when the breed was ranked 125th . The dogs are not classified specifically as either retrievers or as spaniels and so may not compete in AKC field trials , but may compete in AKC hunt tests ( spaniel and retriever tests ) and retriever hunting tests sponsored by the AWSC , the breed club in the United States . The American Water Spaniel Field Association was set up in 1993 by breed enthusiasts supporting AKC Spaniel classification and looking to provide field training opportunities to owners of the breed . In a vote held of members of the AWSC in 1999 , they chose to keep the breed unclassified . 
 = = Appearance = = 
 The limited popularity of the American Water Spaniel restricted development , resulting in the breed being relatively unchanged since its origins in the 19th century . They are a medium @-@ sized dog , with a curly liver , brown , or chocolate colored coat . The average height at the withers for the breed is 15 – 18 inches ( 38 – 46 cm ) , and their weight around 25 – 45 pounds ( 11 – 20 kg ) . They have similar features to the Irish Water Spaniel , but the Irish breed is larger at between 21 – 24 inches ( 53 – 61 cm ) and weighing 55 – 65 pounds ( 25 – 29 kg ) . The coat of the American Water Spaniel can fall in two different patterns , either tightly curled or in the " <unk> pattern " where the fur falls in waves . Working and show lines have not diverged as with some other breeds of spaniel , and both appear the same , with show dogs of this breed being rare . 
 The coat has a coarse outside layer which keeps water away and protects the dog from foliage such as <unk> . The inside layer provides insulation to keep the dog warm . The coat has an oily feel to it , which gives off a " doggy smell " . The breed standard specifies color of the eyes should harmonize with the color of the coat , and should never be yellow . The skull is broad , and carries long , wide ears . The tail is not typically docked . 
 = = Temperament = = 
 In the field , the AWS is less exuberant than the English Springer Spaniel , but it is as skilled in retrieval as Labrador or Golden Retriever . It is versatile regardless of the type of terrain , and in the water it is not the fastest swimmer but has a high level of endurance . The breed is also good at agility and flyball , with the first of the breed receiving a flyball championship title in 1993 . 
 Members of the breed enjoy being the center of attention , and can be quite vocal at times . It is a one family dog , and will often bond with one particular individual . For many years the breed was " pack bred " , where they were allowed to live in a group . Since these times , breeders have been working to breed even tempered dogs that are suitable for both hunting and family life . 
 The AWS has a mind of its own at times and reaches peak performance with the owner who is dedicated to teaching the dog just what is expected of it . The breed takes well to training , and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills . However , members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness . They can be stubborn , and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood . Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments ; other than these lines , the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them . Even though they were originally bred to hunt , due to their size , they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise . 
 = = Health = = 
 Pack breeding early in its development led to a level of genetic variation , so the hereditary conditions of more popular breeds are not common in the AWS . The breed however is known to suffer from eye issues including cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy . Inheritance is suspected in both conditions , with the average age of cataract onset at under one year old . 
 Additional concerns are hypothyroidism , allergies , epilepsy , <unk> and glandular disorders which may cause baldness . The hair loss occurs at around six months of age , affecting the neck , thighs and tail ; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs . Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8 @.@ 3 % of the breed , according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five @-@ year period between 1974 and 1999 . This was one of the lower results of the sporting breeds , with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3 @.@ 4 % , and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47 % . There was no evidence of elbow dysplasia found . The breed has an average life span of 10 – 13 years . 
 = Arniston ( East Indiaman ) = 
 Arniston was an East Indiaman that made eight voyages for the British East India Company ( EIC ) . She was wrecked on 30 May 1815 during a storm at Waenhuiskrans , near Cape Agulhas , South Africa , with the loss of 372 lives – only six on board survived . She had been requisitioned as a troopship and was underway from Ceylon to England on a journey to repatriate wounded soldiers from the Kandyan Wars . 
 Controversially , the ship did not have a marine chronometer on board , a comparatively new and expensive navigational instrument that would have enabled her to determine her longitude accurately . Instead , she was forced to navigate through the heavy storm and strong currents using older , less reliable navigational aids and dead reckoning . Navigational difficulties and a lack of headway led to an incorrect assumption that Cape Agulhas was Cape Point . Consequently , the ship was wrecked when the captain headed north for St Helena with the incorrect belief the ship had already passed Cape Point . 
 = = Overview = = 
 East Indiamen operated under charter or licence to the Honourable East India Company , which held a monopoly granted by Queen Elizabeth I of England for all English trade between the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn . Arniston was built at the Barnard yard at Deptford on the Thames and launched in 1794 . 
 Arniston was heavily armed , with her fifty @-@ eight guns making her the equivalent of a Royal Navy fourth @-@ rate ship of the line . A classification of " ship of the line " – a class of ship that later evolved into the battleship – meant that a ship was powerful enough to stand in a line of battle and explained why these ships of commerce were sometimes mistaken for men @-@ o @-@ war . The armament was necessary for the ship to protect herself and her valuable cargo from pirates and commerce raiders of other nations during long voyages between Europe and the Far East . Arniston , like other East Indiamen , was slow and unmanoeuvrable , but able to carry a large quantity of cargo . 
 = = Voyages ( 1794 – 1812 ) = = 
 Arniston sailed from Great Britain to the Far East eight times before her last voyage . On one of her homeward journeys from China , she struck an uncharted rock at 5 ° 46 ′ 8 ″ S 105 ° 16 ′ 43 ″ E , near the island of Pulo <unk> ( modern day Pulau <unk> ) , located just south of Sumatra . She did not suffer any ill effects as a result of this incident however , which is mentioned in journals of the time only for its <unk> as a navigation hazard to other shipping . 
 Apart from this and another incident in 1800 , Arniston 's first eight voyages were uneventful .

 While Arniston was at St Helena on her outward journey , she undertook to transport troops from there to join Lord Elphinstone , who was undertaking an expedition to capture Cape Colony from the Dutch . On 10 July George Vancouver arrived in HMS Discovery . Vancouver was returning to England after his four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year long voyage of exploration . He transferred to Arniston four field guns that he had been carrying , together with what ammunition he had left for them , for onward transmission to Elphinstone .

 Captain George Simpson left England on 8 June 1814 . At Ceylon , Arniston embarked soldiers of the 73rd Regiment , who were wounded in the Kandyan Wars in Ceylon , to repatriate them to England . 
 = = Wreck ( 1815 ) = = 
 Critically , the ship did not have a chronometer for this voyage , a comparatively new and expensive navigational instrument at the time . Captain George Simpson could not afford the 60 – 100 guineas for one , and the ship 's owners were also unwilling to purchase one , even threatening to replace him with another captain if he refused to set sail without one . 
 Arniston sailed from Port de Galle on 4 April 1815 in a convoy of six other East Indiamen , under the escort of HMS Africaine and HMS Victor . Among her 378 passengers were many invalid soldiers and sailors , plus 14 women and 25 children . 
 During the passage from Ceylon , at one o 'clock every day , the ships signalled each other their longitude that they calculated using their chronometers . In this way , the ships were able to compare their respective instruments , and the master of the Arniston was able to learn his longitude too , as long as he remained in the convoy . 
 On 26 May , while rounding the southern tip of Africa , Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged . Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships , Arniston had to rely instead on older , less accurate navigation methods . Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation . 
 On 29 May , land was sighted to the north at 7 am , and given the dead reckoning estimates , was presumed to be the Cape of Good Hope . The ship sailed west until 4 : 30 pm on 29 May , then turned north to run for St Helena . However the land sighted had in fact been Cape Agulhas ( then known as " Cape L <unk> " ) and the ship had also not made good headway against the current since this sighting . Compounding these navigational errors , the master had not taken any depth soundings ( which would have confirmed his location over the Agulhas Bank ) , before heading north . Consequently , instead of being 100 miles ( 160 km ) west of the Cape of Good Hope as presumed , the ship was closing on the reef at Waenhuiskrans near Cape Agulhas . The anchors were unable to hold the heavy ship in the storm , so on 30 May near 4 pm , Lieutenant Brice advised Captain Simpson to ground the ship to save the lives of those aboard . Eight minutes later , at about 8 pm , the ship struck rocks half a mile offshore and heeled into the wind . The guns on the opposite side were cut away in a failed attempt to level the ship , which soon started to break up in the waves . 
 Only six men of the 378 people on board survived , after reaching the shore only with great difficulty through the high surf . The following morning the sternpost was the only part of the vessel still visible . The ship and her passengers had been lost for the price of a chronometer , or as an officer from the same convoy later wrote : 
 [ T ] his valuable ship , and all the lives on board of her , were actually sacrificed to a piece of short @-@ sighted economy . That they might have been saved , had she been supplied with the worst chronometer that was ever sent to sea , is also quite obvious . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The six survivors buried the bodies found on the beach , then travelled east along the beach , expecting to reach Cape Town . However , after four and a half days , they realised their error and returned to the site of the wreck . Here they subsisted off a cask of oatmeal , while trying to effect repairs to the ship 's pinnace , which had been washed ashore . They were discovered six days later on 14 June by a farmer 's son , who was out hunting . 
 Among the victims were : Captain George Simpson , Lieutenant Brice , Lord and Lady Molesworth . 
 The six survivors were : Dr. Gunter ( boatswain ) , John Barrett ( carpenter ) , Charles Stewart Scott ( carpenter 's mate ) , William <unk> ( second class ) , Gibbs ( third class ) , Robinson ( fourth class ) . 
 A memorial , a replica of which can be seen today , was erected on the beach by the wife of Colonel <unk> , whose four children were lost in the tragedy on their homeward journey , having visited him in Ceylon . The memorial bears the following inscription : 
 Erected by their disconsolate parents to the memory of Thomas , aged 13 years , William Noble , aged 10 , Andrew , aged 8 and Alexander McGregor Murray , aged 7 ( the four eldest sons of Lieut Colonel Andrew <unk> of H.M. 73rd Regiment ) who , with Lord and Lady Molesworth unfortunately perished in the Arniston Transport , wrecked on this shore on 3rd May , 1815 . 
 Over time , the seaside village of Waenhuiskrans has become so associated with the wreck , that it now is also known as Arniston . The nearby town of Bredasdorp has a museum dedicated to the wreck . The wreck had a direct influence on the decision to build a lighthouse at Cape Agulhas to the west in 1847 – 1848 . 
 Thirty seven years later , the 73rd Regiment once again suffered hundreds of casualties on this coast when HMS Birkenhead was wrecked only 50 miles ( 80 km ) away at Gansbaai . 
 = = Archaeological excavation = = 
 The wreck , which lies in about 6 metres ( 20 ft ) of water , was surveyed by an archaeological team from the University of Cape Town ( UCT ) in 1982 . The National Monuments Council issued a permit to UCT student Jim Jobling to conduct an underwater survey of the site , as well as a limited excavation . A number of artefacts were recovered , which were donated to the Bredasdorp Shipwreck Museum . 
 = United States Capitol shooting incident ( 1998 ) = 
 The United States Capitol shooting incident of 1998 was an attack on July 24 , 1998 , which led to the death of two United States Capitol Police officers . Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut were killed when Russell Eugene Weston , Jr . , entered the Capitol and opened fire . Chestnut was killed instantly and Gibson died during surgery at George Washington University Hospital . Weston 's exact motives are unknown , but he has a mental disorder and maintains a strong distrust of the federal government . He remains in a mental institution due to paranoid schizophrenia and has yet to be tried in court . 
 = = The shooting = = 
 On the day of shooting , Officer Chestnut and another officer were assigned to operate the X @-@ ray machine and magnetometer at the Document Door entrance located on the East Front of the Capitol , which was open only to Members of Congress and their staff . Detective Gibson was assigned to the dignitary protection detail of Rep. Tom DeLay ( R @-@ TX ) and was in his suite of offices near this door . Weston , armed with a .38 caliber Smith & Wesson six @-@ shot revolver , entered the Document Door at 3 : 40 p.m. At the same time , Officer Chestnut was providing directions to a tourist and his son while his partner escorted another tourist towards the restroom . Weston reportedly walked around the metal detector just inside the entrance ; Chestnut requested he go back through the detector . Weston suddenly produced the gun and without warning , shot Chestnut in the back of the head at point @-@ blank range . According to witnesses , he turned down a short corridor and pushed through a door which leads to a group of offices used by senior Republican representatives including then Majority Whip Tom DeLay and Representative Dennis Hastert , future Speaker of the House and a close protégé of then Speaker Newt Gingrich . 
 Detective Gibson , who was in plainclothes , was shot after the suspect entered DeLay 's office . Despite being mortally wounded , Detective Gibson was able to return fire and wound the suspect , who was apprehended in that office . A female tourist was grazed by bullets on her shoulder and face . She was treated for her injuries and released . Also injured was <unk> Officer Douglas McMillian . Future Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist , R @-@ Tennessee , a heart surgeon who had been presiding on the Senate floor just before the shooting , resuscitated the gunman and accompanied him to D.C. General Hospital . 
 = = After the shooting = = 
 Officers Chestnut and Gibson were the two people killed in the attack . Following the shooting , both officers received the tribute of lying in honor in the United States Capitol rotunda . They were the first police officers , and Chestnut was the first African American , to receive the honor . 
 In 1999 , Weston was found incompetent to stand trial due to mental illness as he was a man with schizophrenia who stopped taking his medication . A judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered that he be treated with antipsychotic medication without his consent in 2001 , and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the decision . In 2004 , the court determined that Weston still was not competent to be tried , despite ongoing treatment , and suspended but did not dismiss the criminal charges against him . Weston was known to the United States Secret Service prior to the incident as a person who had threatened the President of the United States . 
 The shooting led to the creation of the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund , a nonprofit organization managed by the Capitol Police Board which provides funds for the families of Chestnut and Gibson . In November 2005 , the fund was expanded to include the family of Sgt. Christopher <unk> , a <unk> officer killed during a training accident in 1984 . The shooting was cited as one reason for the development of the Capitol Visitors Center . The legislation authorizing the construction of the facility was introduced by Washington , D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and was entitled the Jacob Joseph Chestnut @-@ John Michael Gibson United States Capitol Visitor Center Act of 1998 . The door where Weston entered was renamed in honor of the two officers , from the Document Door to the Chestnut @-@ Gibson Memorial Door . 
 On March 6 , 2008 , Weston filed a motion requesting a hearing on his mental status . The hearing was held on May 6 with Weston appearing via teleconference from the Federal Medical Center , Butner with his public defender Jane Pierce and two witnesses he selected , a psychologist and vocational rehabilitation specialist . Federal judge Earl Britt denied Weston 's request to be released from the federal facility , arguing that he failed to present enough evidence that he no longer needed to be committed . During the hearing defense psychologist Holly Rogers stated that , " sometimes there are individuals who simply do not respond to medication " , implying that Weston was not ready for release . Had Weston been released from the facility , it would have made it possible for him to be taken to Washington , D.C. to stand trial for the murders of Gibson and Chestnut .

 Detective John Michael Gibson ( March 29 , 1956 – July 24 , 1998 ) was a United States Capitol Police officer assigned to the dignitary protection detail of Congressman Tom DeLay . He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery after lying in honor with Chestnut in the Capitol rotunda . Detective Gibson had served with the agency for 18 years . He was a native of Massachusetts who married the niece of Representative Joe <unk> , Democrat of Massachusetts . He had three children , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old daughter and two boys , ages 15 and 14 . Growing up in New England , Det . Gibson was a lifelong Boston Red Sox fan , and on August 11 , 1998 , his beloved team had a moment of silence in his honor prior to a game with the Kansas City Royals . 
 Officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut ( April 28 , 1940 – July 24 , 1998 ) , was the first African American to lie in honor at the Capitol . Chestnut is buried in Arlington National Cemetery . His funeral included a speech by President Bill Clinton and a fly @-@ over by military jets in a missing man formation . A United States Post Office located in Fort Washington , Maryland has been renamed in their honor . 
 = = The suspect = = 
 Russell Eugene Weston , Jr . ( born December 28 , 1956 ) , also known as Rusty , grew up in Valmeyer , Illinois . Weston attended Valmeyer High School , the only high school in a town of 900 people . Shortly after graduating high school in 1974 , Weston moved to Rimini , Montana , rarely returning to Valmeyer . The only attempt his high school classmates made at inviting him to a class reunion was returned with obscenities written across it . Many of Weston 's Montana neighbors had disliked him , and often ignored him . They considered him to be unusual , and sometimes eccentric . Weston had once thought that his neighbor was using his television satellite dish to spy on his actions and believed Navy SEALs were hiding in his cornfield . 
 He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia six years before the shooting and spent fifty @-@ three days in a mental hospital after threatening a Montana resident . He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself or anyone else . Eighteen months before the shooting , he moved back to Valmeyer from Montana . Once home , he was known to compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the Mississippi River floods of 1993 . There was so much downed timber on his family 's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees . Two days prior to the Capitol shooting , at his grandmother 's insistence to do something about nearby cats which were becoming a nuisance , Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single @-@ barreled shotgun , leaving several in a bucket and burying the rest . 
 Following the Capitol shooting , Weston was transferred to a psychiatric center at Butner Federal Correctional Institution in Butner , North Carolina . In an interview with a court @-@ appointed psychiatrist he explained that he stormed the Capitol to prevent the United States from being annihilated by disease and legions of cannibals . 
 He has never been charged with any crime due to apparent mental <unk> . One contentious issue of Weston 's incarceration is that of forced medication . Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily . His lawyers helped enable this , in order to protect him from the death penalty . In May 2001 , a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily . A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days . He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely . 
 = Hurricane Kathleen ( 1976 ) = 
 Hurricane Kathleen was a tropical cyclone that caused destructive impacts in California . On September 7 , 1976 , a tropical depression formed ; two days later it accelerated north towards the Baja California Peninsula . Kathleen brushed the Pacific coast of the peninsula as a hurricane on September 9 and made landfall as a fast @-@ moving tropical storm the next day . With its circulation intact and still a tropical storm , Kathleen headed north into the United States and affected California and Arizona . Kathleen finally dissipated late on September 11 . 
 Damage in the United States was considerable . California received record rainfall , with over a foot of rain falling in some areas . Flooding caused catastrophic destruction to Ocotillo , and six people drowned . Flooding extended west ; railway tracks were destroyed in Palm Desert and high winds and severe flooding were recorded in Arizona . Overall , the damage total was $ 160 million ( 1976 USD ) and 12 deaths were attributed to the storm .
