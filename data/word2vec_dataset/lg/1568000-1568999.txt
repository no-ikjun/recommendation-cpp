 = = = Life history = = = 
 Like other requiem sharks , the milk shark is viviparous ; females usually have a single functional ovary ( on the left ) and two functional uteruses divided into separate compartments for each embryo . The details of its life history vary across different parts of its range . Females generally produce young every year , though some give birth every other year or even every third year . Mating and parturition take place in spring or early summer ( April to July ) off western and southern Africa , and in winter off India , Alternately , off Oman parturition occurs year @-@ round with a peak in spring . Parturition also occurs continuously in Australian waters ; in the Herald Bight of Shark Bay , the number of newborns peaks in April and again in July . One proposed explanation for the lack of reproductive seasonality in these subpopulations is a lengthier and / or more complex reproductive cycle than has been detected ( such as a period of dormancy in embryonic development , though there is presently no evidence of this occurring ) . Females do not store sperm internally . 
 The litter size ranges from one to eight , with two to five being typical , increasing with female size . In <unk> waters , females on average outnumber males in a litter by more than 2 : 1 , and all @-@ female litters are not uncommon . Similar but less extreme sex imbalances have also been reported from litters of milk sharks off Senegal and eastern India . The reason for this imbalance is unknown , and it has not been observed in related species such as the Atlantic sharpnose shark ( R. <unk> ) . Gestation of the embryos takes around a year and proceeds in three phases . In the first phase , lasting two months to an embryonic length of 63 – 65 mm ( 2 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 6 in ) , the embryo relies on yolk for sustenance and gas exchange occurs across its surface integument and possibly also the yolk sac . During the second phase , which also lasts for two months to an embryonic length of 81 – 104 mm ( 3 @.@ 2 – 4 @.@ 1 in ) , the external gill filaments develop and the yolk sac begins to be resorbed , the <unk> ingesting histotroph ( a nutritious substance secreted by the mother ) in the meantime . In the third phase , lasting six to eight months , the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the fetus receives nourishment until birth . 
 Young sharks are typically born at a length of 32 @.@ 5 – 50 @.@ 0 cm ( 12 @.@ 8 – 19 @.@ 7 in ) and weigh 127 – 350 g ( 0 @.@ 280 – 0 @.@ 772 lb ) . There is an atypical record of a female , caught off Mumbai , carrying a fetus only 23 @.@ 7 cm ( 9 @.@ 3 in ) long that was already nearly fully developed , long before gestation was complete . Pregnant females make use of inshore nursery areas to give birth , taking advantage of the warmer waters and abundant food ; known nursery areas include the Banc d 'Arguin National Park off Mauritania , and Cleveland Bay and Herald Bight off Australia . In Herald Bight , large groups of small milk sharks can be found in shallow tidal pools , as well as in seagrass beds where they are sheltered from predators by the dense , tall vegetation . The sharks move out of these coastal <unk> when they mature . 
 Males and female milk sharks mature at lengths of 84 – 95 cm ( 33 – 37 in ) and 89 – 100 cm ( 35 – 39 in ) respectively off West Africa , 68 – 72 cm ( 27 – 28 in ) and 70 – 80 cm ( 28 – 31 in ) respectively off southern Africa , and 63 – 71 cm ( 25 – 28 in ) and 62 – 74 cm ( 24 – 29 in ) respectively off Oman . These discrepancies in maturation size may be a result of regional variation or incidental selection from heavy fishing pressure . The growth rate for milk sharks off Chennai have been calculated as 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) in the first year , 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) in the second year , 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) in the third year , 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) in the fourth year , 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) in the fifth year , and 3 – 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) per year from then on . The age at maturation is thought to be 2 – 3 years , and the maximum lifespan is at least 8 years . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The milk shark is harmless to humans because of its small size and teeth . Caught using longlines , gillnets , trawls , and hook @-@ and @-@ line , this shark is marketed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption , and is also used for shark fin soup and fishmeal . Its abundance makes it a significant component of artisanal and commercial fisheries across its range . Off northern Australia , it ranks among the most common sharks caught in trawls , and comprises 2 % and 6 % of the annual gillnet and longline catches , respectively . This species is also one of the most commercially important sharks caught off Senegal , Mauritania , Oman , and India . Some sport fishers regard it as a game fish . 
 The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the milk shark under Least Concern ; despite being heavily fished , it has a wide distribution and remains fairly common . The reproductive characteristics of this species suggests it is capable of withstanding a somewhat high level of exploitation , though not as much as the grey sharpnose shark ( R. <unk> ) or Australian sharpnose shark ( R. taylori ) . In the 1980s and early 1990s , stock assessments of the milk shark off India 's <unk> coast concluded catches by gillnet and trawl fisheries were below the maximum sustainable level . However , these studies were based on methodologies that have subsequently been proven unreliable for shark populations . Moreover , fishing pressure in the region has increased substantially since the assessments were conducted .

 = Bohemian waxwing = 
 The Bohemian waxwing ( Bombycilla garrulus ) is a starling @-@ sized passerine bird that breeds in the northern forests of Eurasia and North America . It has mainly buff @-@ grey plumage , black face markings and a pointed crest . Its wings are patterned with white and bright yellow , and some feather tips have the red waxy appearance that give this species its English name . The three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance . Females are similar to males , although young birds are less well @-@ marked and have few or no waxy wingtips . Although the Bohemian waxwing 's range overlaps those of the cedar and Japanese waxwings , it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences . 
 The breeding habitat is coniferous forests , usually near water . The pair build a lined cup @-@ shaped nest in a tree or bush , often close to the trunk . The clutch of 3 – 7 eggs is incubated by the female alone for 13 – 14 days to hatching . The chicks are altricial and naked , and are fed by both parents , initially mostly with insects , but thereafter mainly fruit . They fledge about 14 – 16 days after leaving the egg . Many birds desert their nesting range in winter and migrate farther south . In some years , large numbers of Bohemian waxwings <unk> well beyond their normal winter range in search of the fruit that makes up most of their diet . 
 Waxwings can be very tame in winter , entering towns and gardens in search of food , rowan berries being a particular favourite . They can metabolise alcohol produced in fermenting fruit , but can still become intoxicated , sometimes fatally . Other hazards include predation by birds of prey , infestation by parasites and collisions with cars or windows . The Bohemian waxwing 's high numbers and very large breeding area mean that it is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The waxwings are a family , <unk> , of short @-@ tailed stocky birds with soft plumage , a head crest and distinctively patterned wings and tails . There are three species , the Bohemian , cedar , and Japanese waxwings . DNA studies and shared features such as a relatively large size , grey underparts and similar undertail patterns suggest that the Japanese and Bohemian waxwings are most closely related within the genus . Although only the cedar and Bohemian waxwings normally have red tips on their wing feathers , this feature is occasionally shown by the Japanese waxwing , suggesting that this was originally a whole @-@ family characteristic that has been lost in one species , rather than an indicator of a close relationship . DNA analysis confirms that the cedar waxwing diverged early from the other members of the family . Outside the genus , the closest relatives of the waxwings are believed to be the silky @-@ flycatchers , the <unk> , and the grey <unk> , all of which have sometimes been included in the <unk> . 
 The Bohemian waxwing was described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Lanius Garrulus . The waxwings were moved to their own genus , Bombycilla , by Vieillot in 1808 . The genus name Bombycilla comes from the Greek <unk> , " silk " and the Modern Latin <unk> , " tail " ; this is a direct translation of the German <unk> , " silk @-@ tail " , and refers to the silky @-@ soft plumage of the bird . The species name garrulus is the Latin for talkative and was applied to this bird , as " Garrulus <unk> " , by Conrad Gessner in 1555 ; the term is a reference to a supposed likeness to the Eurasian jay ( Garrulus glandarius ) rather than to the waxwing 's vocalisations . The English name " waxwing " refers to the bright red tips of the secondary feathers on its wings , which look like drops of sealing wax , while " Bohemian " follows Gessner 's usage , and may refer to the Romani , alluding to the bird 's wanderings , or to its presumed origin from Bohemia . " <unk> " and " Bohemian waxwing " were first recorded in 1817 , the former as a reference to Vieillot 's separation of this bird from the " <unk> " . 
 There are three recognised subspecies : 
 B. g. garrulus ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) : the nominate subspecies . Breeds in northern Europe from northern Sweden east to the Ural Mountains . 
 B. g. <unk> ( <unk> , 1915 ) : breeds from the Urals eastwards across northern Asia . 
 B. g. pallidiceps ( Reichenow , 1908 ) : breeds in northwestern North America . 
 The differences between these forms are small and clinal , and the species could be possibly considered as monotypic . The fossil record includes Pleistocene deposits from the UK and the Carpathian Mountains . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Bohemian waxwing is a starling @-@ sized bird 19 – 23 cm ( 7 @.@ 5 – 9 @.@ 1 in ) in length with a 32 – 35 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 @.@ 6 – 14 @.@ 0 in ) wingspan , and an average weight of 55 g ( 1 @.@ 9 oz ) . It is short @-@ tailed , mainly brownish @-@ grey , and has a conspicuous crest on its head . The male of the nominate subspecies has a black mask through the eye and a black throat . There is a white streak behind the bill and a white curve below the eye . The lower belly is a rich chestnut colour and there are cinnamon @-@ coloured areas around the mask . The rump is grey and the tail ends in a bright yellow band with a broad black border above it . The wings are very distinctive ; the flight feathers are black and the primaries have markings that produce a yellow stripe and white " fishhooks " on the closed wing . The adult 's secondaries end in long red appendages with the sealing wax appearance that gives the bird its English name . The eyes are dark brown , the bill is mainly black , and the legs are dark grey or black . In flight , the waxwing 's large flocks , long wings and short tail give some resemblance to the common starling , and its flight is similarly fast and direct . It clambers easily through bushes and trees but only shuffles on the ground . 
 The soft , dense feathers are kept in good condition by preening . The red waxy tips are the extended and flattened ends of feather shafts , pigmented with astaxanthin and enclosed in a transparent sheath . A study of the cedar waxwings showed that the red tips are few or absent until the third year of life for that related species . All adult waxwings have a complete moult annually between August and January . Juveniles moult at the same time but retain their flight and some other wing feathers . 
 The female Bohemian waxwing is very similar to the male , but has a narrower yellow terminal band to the tail , a less defined lower edge to the black throat and slightly less distinctive wing markings . Juveniles are duller than adults , with whiter underparts , only a few red wing tips , no black on the throat and a smaller black face mask . Compared to the nominate subspecies , eastern B. g. <unk> is paler , greyer and has little reddish @-@ brown behind the bill . The American subspecies B. g. pallidiceps has more colouring on the cheeks and forehead than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance . 
 The range of the Bohemian waxwing overlaps those of both the other members of the genus . The cedar waxwing is smaller than the Bohemian ; it has browner upperparts , a white undertail and a white line above the black eye patch . Adult cedar waxwings have a yellowish belly , and all ages have less strongly patterned wings than the Bohemian waxwing . The Japanese waxwing is easily distinguished from its relatives ; it has a red terminal band to the tail , the black mask extends up the rear of the crest , and there is no yellow stripe or red tips on the wings . 
 The Bohemian waxwing 's call is a high trill <unk> . It is less wavering and lower @-@ pitched than that of the cedar waxwing , and longer and lower @-@ pitched than the call of the Japanese waxwing . Other calls are just variants of the main vocalisation ; a quieter version is used by chicks to call parents , and courtship calls , also given during nest construction , have a particularly large frequency range . Although not a call as such , when a flock takes off or lands , the wings make a distinctive rattling sound that can be heard 30 m ( 98 ft ) away . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Bohemian waxwing has a circumpolar distribution , breeding in northern regions of Eurasia and North America . In Eurasia , its northern nesting limit is just short of the treeline , roughly at the 10 ° C July isotherm , and it breeds south locally to about 51 ° N. Most birds breed between 60 – 67 ° N , reaching 70 ° N in Scandinavia . The North American subspecies breeds in the northwestern and north central areas of the continent , its range extending southwards beyond the US border in the Rocky Mountains . 
 This waxwing is migratory with much of the breeding range abandoned as the birds move south for the winter . Migration starts in September in the north of the range , a month or so later farther south . Eurasian birds normally winter from eastern Britain through northern parts of western and central Europe , Ukraine , Kazakhstan and northern China to Japan . North American breeders have a more southeasterly trend , many birds wintering in southeast Canada , with smaller numbers in the north central and northeastern US states . Birds do not usually return to the same wintering sites in successive years . One bird wintering in the Ukraine was found 6 @,@ 000 km ( 3 @,@ 700 mi ) to the east in Siberia in the following year . 
 In some years , this waxwing <unk> south of its normal wintering areas , sometimes in huge numbers . The fruit on which the birds depend in winter varies in abundance from year to year , and in poor years , particularly those following a good crop the previous year , the flocks move farther south until they reach adequate supplies . They will stay until the food runs out and move on again . In what may be the largest ever irruption in Europe , in the winter of 2004 – 2005 , more than half a million waxwings were recorded in Germany alone . This invasion followed an unusually warm , dry breeding season . In 1908 , an American flock 60 – 90 m ( 200 – 300 ft ) wide was noted as taking two to three minutes to fly over . 
 The breeding habitat is mature conifers , often spruce although other conifers and broadleaf trees may also be present . More open , wet areas such as lakes and peat swamps with dead and drowned trees are used for feeding on insects . Lowlands , valleys and uplands are used in Eurasia , although mountains tend to be avoided . However , the North American subspecies nests in Canada at altitudes between 900 – 1 @,@ 550 m ( 2 @,@ 950 – 5 @,@ 090 ft ) . Outside the breeding season , the waxwing will occupy a wide range of habitats as long as suitable fruits such as rowan are available . It may be found by roads , in parks and gardens or along hedges or woodlands edges . It shows little fear of humans at this time . In winter , waxwings roost communally in dense trees or hedges , sometimes with American robins , fieldfares or other wintering species . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Bohemian waxwings start their return from the wintering grounds in February or March , but northern breeders do not reach their breeding areas until April or early May . This monogamous species nests mainly from mid June to July . 
 Waxwings are not highly territorial , and , although normally solitary breeders , several pairs may nest close together where there are a number of good nest sites . Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates , and females may squabble over nest sites . Aggression is shown by <unk> down the feathers and crest , showing the black throat , and opening the bill . The breeding display is almost the opposite of this ; the male erects his body and crest feathers , and turns his head away from the female . The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item , often food , to his partner , placing it in her open bill . In about 90 % of cases , this display does not lead to copulation . Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females . 
 The nest , built by both sexes , is a cup of thin twigs lined with softer material such as fine grass , moss , fur or lichen . It is constructed 1 @.@ 3 – 15 m ( 4 – 50 ft ) above the ground in a pine or scrub , commonly close to the trunk . The eggs are a glossy pale blue spotted with black and grey and the clutch is 3 – 7 eggs , although five or six is most common . The average size of the egg is 24 mm × 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 94 in × 0 @.@ 71 in ) , and it weighs 3 @.@ 8 g ( 0 @.@ 13 oz ) , of which 5 % is shell . The eggs are incubated for 13 – 14 days by the female alone . She is fed regurgitated berries by her mate , and rarely leaves the nest . The chicks are altricial and naked , and have bright red mouths ; they are fed by both parents , although the male brings most of the food , mainly insects , in the first few days . The young are subsequently fed largely with fruit . The chicks fledge about 14 – 16 days after hatching . They are fed by the adults for about two weeks after fledging . 
 Breeding densities of this waxwing are typically low compared to other passerines , usually less than ten birds per square kilometre ( 26 per square mile ) even in good habitat , although up to 35 · 6 birds per square kilometre ( 92 per square mile ) have been found in Russia . One brood each year is normal . Maximum recorded ages are 5 years 10 months in North America and more than 13 years 6 months in Europe . The average life expectancy is unknown . Significant causes of death include predation , collisions with windows and cars , and poisoning by road salt consumed when drinking . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Waxwings are primarily fruit eaters , but also consume insects during the breeding season . Mosquitoes and midges are the most common prey , but many other insects and some spiders are eaten . They are caught mainly by <unk> from an open perch , but some may be picked off vegetation . Fruit is normally picked from trees , sometimes from the ground , and is usually swallowed whole . In the summer , Vaccinium and Rubus species and Canada <unk> are important items of their diet , while cotoneaster , juniper , <unk> , rose hips and apples predominate outside the breeding season . Rowan berries are a favourite food , and are eaten whenever available . 
 Waxwings can eat huge numbers of berries , each bird sometimes consuming several hundred a day , more than double its own weight . One individual was recorded as eating between 600 and 1 @,@ 000 cotoneaster berries in six hours , and defecating every four minutes . Waxwings travel significant distances when feeding and help to disperse the fruit seeds . Waxwings forage in large flocks , sometimes of several hundred birds , which enables them to overwhelm birds such as mistle thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees . 
 Fruit is rich in sugar but deficient in other nutrients , so it must be eaten in large quantities . Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy . They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans , but may still become intoxicated , sometimes fatally . Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter , since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect . In the summer , the fruits are <unk> and water is less of a problem . 
 In the past , the arrival of waxwings sometimes coincided with epidemics of cholera or plague , and led to the old Dutch and Flemish name <unk> , " plague bird " . The juniper berries on which they fed were thought to offer protection , and people consumed the fruit and burned branches to fumigate their houses . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 Waxwings are preyed upon by birds of prey including rough @-@ legged buzzards , Eurasian sparrowhawks , prairie falcons , and great grey shrikes . Merlins attack winter flocks , including those in cities . When alarmed , Bohemian waxwings " freeze " with bill and neck pointing upwards . If this fails , they fly , calling noisily . 
 Bohemian waxwings are not brood parasitised by the common cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo 's young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet . In North America , the waxwing 's breeding range has little overlap with brown @-@ headed cowbird , another parasitic species . Nevertheless , eggs of other birds placed in a Bohemian waxwing 's nest are always rejected . This suggests that in the past , perhaps 3 million years ago , the ancestral waxwing was a host of a brood parasitic species , and retains the rejection behaviour acquired then . 
 Parasitic mites include <unk> <unk> , first identified on this species , and the nasal mite Ptilonyssus <unk> . Blood parasites include Trypanosoma species , and a Leucocytozoon first identified in this waxwing . Bohemian waxwings may carry flatworms and tapeworms , but levels of parasitic worm infestation are generally low . 
 = = Status = = 
 The global population of the Bohemian waxwing has been estimated at more than three million birds , and the breeding range covers about 12 @.@ 8 million km2 ( 4 @.@ 9 million mi2 ) . Although this species ' population , as of 2013 , appears to be declining , the decrease is not rapid nor large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria . Given its high numbers and huge breeding area , this waxwing is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern . The woodlands used by this species are well to the north of major human populations , and the birds can use disturbed habitats , so there are no serious long @-@ term threats to this species .

 " Tales from the Public Domain " is the fourteenth episode of The Simpsons thirteenth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 17 , 2002 . It is the third trilogy episode of the series , which had become annual since the twelfth season 's " Simpsons Tall Tales " , consisting of three self @-@ contained segments that are based on historical stories . The first segment puts Homer Simpson in the role of Odysseus in the ancient Greek epic poem Odyssey . The second segment tells the story of Saint Joan of Arc , and the third and final segment lampoons William Shakespeare 's tragedy Hamlet . 
 The episode was written by Andrew Kreisberg , Josh Lieb and Matt Warburton , and Mike B. Anderson served as the director . Show runner and executive producer Al Jean stated that the episode was " very fun for the writers " to do because it " allow [ ed ] them to parody great works of literature . " On the other hand , Anderson stated that the episode was " much harder " to direct than others because , like with Treehouse of Horror episodes , the animators had to make as many character designs for one act as they would for one normal episode . 
 In its original American broadcast , the episode was seen by more than 4 % of the population between ages 18 and 49 . Following its release on DVD and Blu @-@ ray however , the episode received mixed reviews from critics . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Homer is told that he has an overdue book from the library , which he checked out when Bart was a baby . He says that he had intended to read to Bart every day , but various things had gotten in his way . Before he returns it , he reads from the book , telling three stories . 
 = = = D 'oh , Brother Where Art Thou ? = = = 
 In this story , Homer is Odysseus , and delivers the King of Troy ( Ned Flanders ) a Trojan horse . He and his crew , including Apu , Lenny , Moe , Professor Frink and Carl , kill all of Troy 's citizens and win . However , he refuses to sacrifice a sheep , angering the gods , Zeus ( Mayor Quimby ) , Dionysus ( Barney ) , and Poseidon ( Captain Horatio McCallister ) . Dionysus tries to destroy Odysseus with a lightning bolt , but misses and instead destroys the island of Atlantis . Poseidon literally blows Odysseus and his crew to the Sirens ( Patty and Selma ) and visit Circe ( Lindsey Naegle ) , who turns his crew into pigs , whom Odysseus eats . Circe orders Odysseus to go through Hades , crossing the River Styx ( which has the Styx song " Lady " playing during the crossing ) , in order to go home so he can see Penelope ( Marge ) and Telemachus ( Bart ) . When he arrives back to Ithaca , he spears all of the suitors ( Krusty the Klown , Kirk Van Houten , Groundskeeper Willie , Mr. Burns , and Sideshow Mel ) trying to please Penelope . Penelope decides to take him back , though he leaves to go to Moe 's ( even though Moe is killed and eaten by Odysseus earlier in the episode ) .

 Lisa is Joan of Arc , who leads the French against the English in the Hundred Years ' War , which Homer implies was also called " Operation Speedy Resolution " . Despite her family 's concern , she joins the army , where she has new ideas about defeating the enemy . She meets the King of France ( Milhouse ) . During a battle , the English capture Joan and put her on trial . She is accused of witchcraft , and sentenced to death . When Lisa claims that she was following God 's will , Groundskeeper Willie reveals that he too was chosen by God , but to lead the English armies against the French . God 's voice then excuses himself by revealing that the two were never supposed to meet . 
 The use of Groundskeeper Willie ( Scottish character ) and the flag of the English army ( Union Flag of Great Britain ) are obvious inaccuracies , as England and Scotland were separate states and many Scottish fought with France during the Hundred Years War . 
 As they read the end , Joan of Arc is being burnt at the stake , still waiting for God to save her ( the real Joan had said several days earlier that her voices had spoken to her of martyrdom ) . Shocked , Lisa asks Homer if she was really burned to death . Marge then interrupts , claiming that Joan of Arc was rescued by Sir Lancelot , and they get married and live in a spaceship . She then rips out the last page and eats it , remarking that it is easier to chew than the video of Bambi .

 Bart is Prince Hamlet in this Simpsons version of William Shakespeare 's classic . His uncle Claudius ( Moe ) marries Gertrude ( Marge ) after killing King Hamlet ( Homer ) by way of poison . The King returns to his son as a ghost , telling him of the betrayal and requesting that his death be avenged . Prince Hamlet ( Bart ) , with the help of a professional actor ( Krusty ) , puts on a play to make Claudius reveal himself to be guilty ; however , Hamlet 's reaction leads everyone to believe that he is crazy , so Ophelia ( Lisa ) decides to " out @-@ crazy " him by prancing around and singing a stupid song , eventually jumping out the window and into the moat where she drowns . Because Hamlet knows what he did , Claudius attempts to kill him . Hamlet , aiming to kill Claudius , accidentally kills Polonius ( Chief Wiggum ) . His son , Laertes ( Ralph Wiggum ) , proposes to duel Prince Hamlet for revenge . As his " practice stab , " Laertes kills himself , and Hamlet proceeds to murder Claudius . <unk> and <unk> ( Carl and Lenny ) , meanwhile , have been covered in poison and kill each other with a high five . Hamlet walks away to celebrate , but he slips on some blood and dies . Seeing a big mess she does not want to clean up , Gertrude commits suicide by hitting herself in the head with a mace . 
 Bart thinks Hamlet was boring despite every character being murdered , but Homer tells him that the story led to the film Ghostbusters , and all the Simpsons dance to the theme .

 " Tales from the Public Domain " was directed by Mike B. Anderson and written by Andrew Kreisberg , Josh Lieb and Matt Warburton . It originally aired on March 17 , 2002 on the Fox network . " Tales from the Public Domain " is the third trilogy episode produced for the series , the other two being " Simpsons Bible Stories " from season 10 , and " Simpsons Tall Tales " from season 12 . Al Jean , the show runner for the episode , stated that trilogy episodes are " very fun for the writers " to do because it allows them to parody " great works of literature " and condense them into one act each . 
 Before writing the episode , the writers had decided that one of the segments would feature Lisa as the main character . According to Jean , the writers found it very difficult to find a historical story for Lisa because there are " so few [ historical stories ] that star women " . They had the same problem when pitching stories for " Simpsons Tall Tales " , in which they resorted to giving Lisa the role of " Connie Appleseed " , a feminization of the historical figure Johnny Appleseed . The writers eventually settled on Saint Joan of Arc . According to the episode 's supervising producer Don Payne , Scottish actor David Tennant watched " Do the Bard , Man " along with the cast of Hamlet during their first rehearsal . The segment has also been used in schools to teach students about Shakespeare ’ s literary work . 
 In the DVD audio commentary for the episode , Anderson stated that trilogy episodes , like the Treehouse of Horror episodes , are " much harder " to direct than normal ones because the animators have to make as many designs for each act as they would for one normal episode . In the scene in which Joan gets torched by the English , Jean specifically ordered Anderson to " make sure she doesn 't get burned " , even though she was surrounded by flames . Jean explained in the commentary that , when Mike Scully was show runner for The Simpsons , Jean learned that " people do not wanna see changes in [ the characters ' ] basic design " when the character gets hurt . He added that , because the viewer is " so attached to the characters , [ the viewers ] don 't wanna see ... especially Lisa , get hurt in any way . " In order to make Homer 's ghost in the third segment transparent , the animators had to " double expose " him ; Homer 's cels were first shot normally and then with a diminished opacity . In the first segment , clouds can be seen moving behind Zeus . The clouds were animated by airbrushing the cels and then moving them slowly in order to make it " look heavenly " . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Each segment is based on and include references to historical stories ; " D 'oh Brother , Where Art Thou " takes its story from the ancient Greek epic poem the Odyssey , while taking its name from the movie O Brother , Where Art Thou ? ( also based on the Odyssey ) , " Hot Child in the City " is based on the life and legend of Saint Joan of Arc , a French peasant girl who , as a teenager , led the French army to several important victories during the Hundred Years ' War , and " Do the Bard , Man " spoofs William Shakespeare 's tragedy Hamlet , while the title takes its name from " Do the Bartman " , a song performed by Bart early in the series . 
 The song that the sirens are singing in the first segment is a parody on the 1978 disco song " Copacabana " by Barry Manilow . In order to return to Ithaca , Homer crosses the river Styx , in which the dead can be seen dancing " Lady " by the band Styx . In the second segment , the captain resembling Chief Wiggum is initially leading the French army . The soldier resembling Lou points out that the captain " keeps switching back from French and English . " The scene satirizes films like Doctor Zhivago in which the Russians speak with a British accent even though they are in Russia . At the end of the act , Marge can be seen eating the page which shows Joan 's demise and , say " Well , it 's easier to chew than that Bambi video . " The scene is a reference to a scene in the Disney film Bambi , in which Bambi 's mother is shot to death by hunters . 
 In the beginning of the third act , Bart argues that modern writers like Steven Bochco , one of the creators of the television series NYPD Blue , are more talented than Shakespeare . Bochco saw the episode with his children and was so flattered that he sent The Simpsons staff some NYPD Blue merchandise . After the ghost of Homer has spoken to Bart , he leaves Bart 's room by flying through the wall , causing slime to appear on the wall . This is a reference to <unk> , a ghost from the Ghostbusters franchise who has a similar function .

 In its original American broadcast on March 17 , 2002 , " Tales from the Public Domain " , along with a new episode of Malcolm in the Middle , received more than a full rating point more than ABC 's showing of the film Snow White : The Fairest of Them All , which received a 3 @.@ 1 rating among adults between ages 18 and 49 , according to Nielsen Media Research . This means that the episode was watched by more than 4 % of the American population of said demographic at the time of its broadcast . On August 24 , 2010 , the episode was released as part of The Simpsons : The Complete Thirteenth Season on DVD and Blu @-@ ray . 
 Following the release of The Simpsons thirteenth season , " Tales from the Public Domain " received mixed reviews from critics . Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that The Simpsons trilogy episodes " tend to be pretty spotty . " Of the three stories , Jacobsson liked " Do the Bard , Man " the most , although he overall found the episode to be " mediocre " . Adam Rayner of Obsessed with Film wrote that , even though the episode " has a few laughs " , it " just feels half @-@ hearted " , and , writing for 411Mania , Ron Martin described the episode as being " just a lazy way out for the writers " . Giving the episode a negative review , Nate Boss of Project : Blu wrote that the episode is " awful " and " Kinda annoying " , and that it " has been done so many times , it 's hardly all that funny " . On the other hand , Casey Broadwater of Blu @-@ ray.com wrote that he is " particularly fond of [ the episode ] " and Rosie Fletcher of Total Film considered it to be a " stand @-@ out " episode in the season . The Vulture column of New York magazine named it one of the ten best episodes of the show 's later era .

 The Imperatritsa Mariya @-@ class ( Russian : Императрица Мария ) battleships were the first dreadnoughts built for the Black Sea Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy . All three ships were built in Nikolayev during World War I ; two of the ships were built by the <unk> Dockyard and the third was built by the Associated Factories and Shipyards of Nikolayev ( Russian : ONZiV ) . Two ships were delivered in 1915 and saw some combat against ex @-@ German warships that had been ' gifted ' to the Ottoman Empire , but the third was not completed until 1917 and saw no combat due to the disorder in the navy after the February Revolution earlier that year . 
 Imperatritsa Mariya was sunk by a magazine explosion in Sevastopol harbor in 1916 . Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya , having been renamed Svobodnaya Rossiya in 1917 , was scuttled in Novorossiysk harbor in 1918 to prevent her from being turned over to the Germans as required by the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk . The crew of Volia , as Imperator Aleksander III had been renamed in 1917 , voted to turn her over to the Germans . They were only able to make one training cruise before they had to turn her over the victorious Allies in 1918 as part of the armistice terms . The British took control of her , but turned her over to the White Russians in 1920 who renamed her General Alekseyev . She only had one operable gun turret by this time and she provided some fire support for the Whites , but it was not enough . They were forced to evacuate the Crimea later that year and sailed with Wrangel 's fleet to Bizerte ( Tunisia ) where she was interned by the French . She was eventually scrapped there during the 1930s to pay her docking fees . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 The Naval Ministry began planning a class of dreadnoughts for the Black Sea Fleet in 1910 when they learned that the Ottomans were on the verge of ordering dreadnoughts of their own from the British . This rumor proved to false , but the Russians had decided that they should continue the design process for the time when the Ottomans did procure dreadnoughts of their own . Preliminary specifications were issued on 12 August 1910 for a design based on that of the Gangut @-@ class battleships then being built for the Baltic Fleet . 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) was thought to be excessive in the confined environs of the Black Sea so the new design was capable of only 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) which allowed more weight to be devoted to more guns or heavier armor . A main armament of a dozen 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns in four triple turrets was specified in the same ' linear ' non @-@ superfiring arrangements as the Ganguts . The sixteen 120 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) anti @-@ torpedo boat guns of the Ganguts were replaced by twenty 130 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) / 55 B7 Pattern 1913 guns to counter the ever @-@ increasing size of torpedo boats . The maximum elevation of the 12 @-@ inch guns was to be increased to 35 ° , 10 ° more than in the Gangut @-@ class ships , and turret armor was to be increased from 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) to 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) . 
 A design competition was announced in July 1911 , but there were not many contenders . The Naval Ministry favored the design from the Russud Works and gave preliminary orders for three ships on 2 September , even before the competition was concluded in November . Russud 's design was unsurprisingly selected and the government transferred designers from the government @-@ owned Baltic Works as well as a complete set of drawings for the Gangut @-@ class to speed up the detailed design process . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The ships of the Imperatritsa Mariya @-@ class were 168 meters ( 551 ft 2 in ) long overall , had a beam of 27 @.@ 43 meters ( 90 ft 0 in ) and at full load a draft of 8 @.@ 36 meters ( 27 ft 5 in ) . They displaced 23 @,@ 413 long tons ( 23 @,@ 789 t ) at standard load . High @-@ tensile steel was used throughout the hull with mild steel used only in areas that did not contribute to structural strength . The hull was subdivided by 18 transverse watertight bulkheads . The engine room was divided by two longitudinal bulkheads and a double bottom was provided . Their designed metacentric height was 1 @.@ 76 meters ( 5 ft 9 in ) . 
 Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya was slightly larger than her half @-@ sisters because ONZiV enlarged her in an effort to counter the usual problem Russian battleships had with weight . She was 168 meters ( 551 ft 2 in ) long at the waterline and had a beam of 28 @.@ 07 meters ( 92 ft 1 in ) ; 4 feet 10 inches ( 1 @.@ 47 m ) longer and 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) wider than her half sisters . Her exact draft is not known , but she had a draft of 8 @.@ 7 meters ( 28 ft 7 in ) on trials . Her displacement was 24 @,@ 644 long tons ( 25 @,@ 039 t ) at load , over 900 long tons ( 914 t ) more than her designed displacement of 23 @,@ 783 long tons ( 24 @,@ 165 t ) . 
 Imperatritsa Mariya proved to be very bow @-@ heavy in service and tended to ship large amounts of water through her forward casemates . The ammunition for the forward 12 @-@ inch guns was reduced from 100 to 70 rounds each while the 130 mm ammunition was reduced from 245 to 100 rounds per gun in an attempt to compensate for her trim . This did not fully cure the problem , but Imperatritsa Mariya was lost before any other changes could be implemented . This did not fully cure the problem so Volia 's , as she was known by then , forward pair of 130 mm guns were removed while she was fitting out . Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya did not suffer from the same degree of trim by the bow by virtue of her greater size and retained her forward guns .

 The two Russud @-@ built ships were fitted with four Parsons @-@ type steam turbines imported from John Brown & Company of the United Kingdom while Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya 's turbines were built by ONZiV with technical assistance from Vickers Limited . They were designed for a total of 26 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 19 @,@ 388 kW ) ( 27 @,@ 000 shp ( 20 @,@ 134 kW ) in Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya ) , but produced over 33 @,@ 000 shp ( 24 @,@ 608 kW ) on trials . 20 mixed @-@ firing triangular Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers powered the turbines at a working pressure of 17 @.@ 5 atm ( 1 @,@ 773 kPa ; 257 psi ) . Their designed speed was 21 knots . Their maximum coal capacity ranged from 1 @,@ 700 to 2 @,@ 300 long tons ( 1 @,@ 727 to 2 @,@ 337 t ) plus 420 to 630 long tons ( 427 to 640 t ) of fuel oil which gave them a range of approximately 1 @,@ 640 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 037 km ; 1 @,@ 887 mi ) at full speed or 2 @,@ 960 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 482 km ; 3 @,@ 406 mi ) at economical speed . All of their electrical power was generated by three main Curtis 360 kilowatt turbo generators and two 200 kilowatt auxiliary units .

 The main armament of the Imperatritsa Mariya @-@ class consisted of a dozen Obukhovskii 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) Pattern 1907 52 @-@ caliber guns mounted in four triple turrets distributed the length of the ship . The guns were identical to those used in the Gangut @-@ class ships , but the turrets were of a new and roomier design . The fore and aft turrets could traverse a total of 310 ° while the middle turrets covered an arc of 130 ° on each side . The guns could be depressed to − 5 ° and elevated to 25 ° and could be loaded at any angle between − 5 ° and + 15 ° ; their rate of fire was supposed to three rounds per minute up to 15 ° of elevation . The turrets could elevate at 3 – 4 ° per second and traverse at a rate of 3 @.@ 2 ° per second . 100 rounds per gun were carried at full load . The guns fired 470 @.@ 9 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 038 lb ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 762 m / s ( 2 @,@ 500 ft / s ) ; this provided a maximum range of 23 @,@ 230 meters ( 25 @,@ 400 yd ) . 
 The secondary armament consisted of twenty 130 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) / 55 @-@ caliber B7 Pattern 1913 guns mounted in casemates . They were arranged in two groups , six guns per side from the forward turret to the rear funnel and the remaining four clustered around the rear turret . Three guns per side were situated to fire ahead as that was the most likely direction of attack by torpedo boats as anticipated by the Naval General Staff . Their rate of fire ranged from five to eight rounds per minute and they were provided with 245 rounds per gun . They had a maximum range of about 15 @,@ 364 meters ( 16 @,@ 802 yd ) with a 36 @.@ 86 @-@ kilogram ( 81 @.@ 3 lb ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 823 m / s ( 2 @,@ 700 ft / s ) . 
 No anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) armament was originally planned . In October 1916 , the Naval Ministry specified that four 37 @-@ caliber 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) guns of a new design were to be fitted , but they never entered service . The two older ships had three or four 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) / 50 @-@ caliber Pattern 1892 guns mounted on turret roofs . The 75 mm gun had maximum elevation of 50 ° . It fired a 12 @.@ 63 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 73 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 450 ft / s ( 750 m / s ) at a rate of fire of 12 – 15 rounds per minute . It had a maximum ceiling of less than 16 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 900 m ) . Volia used four of the newer 30 @-@ caliber 76 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 00 in ) ' Lender ' AA guns , mounted on the fore and aft turrets . This had a maximum depression of 5 ° and a maximum elevation of 65 ° . It fired a 14 @.@ 33 @-@ pound ( 6 @.@ 50 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 929 ft / s ( 588 m / s ) . It had a rate of fire of 10 – 12 rounds per minute and had a maximum ceiling of 19 @,@ 000 ft ( 5 @,@ 800 m ) . 
 Four underwater 17 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 450 mm ) torpedo tubes were also fitted , two on each broadside in a compartment immediately abaft the forward magazine . Imperatritsa Mariya 's trials revealed problems with her magazine cooling systems where the heat generated by the ventilation system mostly negated the cooling effects of the refrigeration system . Her sisters shared this problem , which may have contributed to the magazine fire suffered by Imperatritsa Mariya that led to her loss in 1916 . 
 The two older ships mounted Zeiss 5 @-@ meter ( 16 ft 5 in ) rangefinders on each conning tower , but Volia was given four 18 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) Barr and Stroud rangefinders , one for each turret . These would provide data for the central artillery post to calculate , using the standard Geisler mechanical computer , and then transmit to the guns for the gun crew to follow . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The full @-@ scale armor trials with the hulk of the old pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Chesma greatly affected the armor protection of the Imperatritsa Mariya @-@ class ships . The Krupp cemented armor plates were sized to match the frames to provide support for their joints and they were locked together by a type of mortise and tenon joint to better distribute the shock of a shell 's impact . The waterline belt had a maximum thickness of 262 @.@ 5 millimeters ( 10 @.@ 33 in ) . It was continued forward and aft of the citadel by plates 217 millimeters ( 8 @.@ 5 in ) and 175 millimeters ( 6 @.@ 9 in ) thick . These reduced to 125 millimeters ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) and then to 75 millimeters just before the bow . Aft the belt thinned to 125 millimeters all the way to the stern . It had a total height of 5 @.@ 25 meters ( 17 @.@ 2 ft ) , 3 @.@ 5 meters ( 11 ft ) of which was above the design waterline and 1 @.@ 75 meters ( 5 ft 9 in ) below . It was backed by 75 millimeters of wood to make a better fit between the hull and the armor . The forward end of the citadel was protected by other armor and the transverse bulkhead was therefore only 25 @.@ 4 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 00 in ) thick , barely enough to consider as splinter protection . However , the rear bulkhead had no other protection and was 100 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick . These thin bulkheads left the end magazines very vulnerable to shells fired from bearings in front of or behind the ship . The upper belt was 100 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick and had a height of 2 @.@ 7 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 11 in ) . It thinned to 75 mm forward of the casemates all the way to the bow . The casemates were also protected by a 25 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) transverse bulkhead from axial fire as well as a 25 mm screen between each casemate . Behind the side armor was an inboard longitudinal splinter bulkhead that was 50 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick , but the casemates had their own separate 25 mm splinter bulkhead . 
 The main gun turrets had sides 250 millimeters ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) thick with 125 mm roofs . 50 mm plates protected the gun ports and 25 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) bulkheads separated each gun . The barbettes were 250 mm thick , but reduced to 125 mm below the upper deck , except in the forward and rear turrets which thinned only to 150 millimeters ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) . The forward conning tower sides were 300 millimeters ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) thick with a 200 millimeters ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) roof and 250 mm supporting tube which reduced to 100 mm below the upper deck . The rear conning tower also had 300 mm sides and a 250 mm support tube , but the roof was only 100 mm thick . The funnel uptakes were protected by 75 mm of armor above the upper deck , but this reduced to 19 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 75 in ) below it . The upper deck was 37 @.@ 5 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 48 in ) thick while the middle deck was 25 mm thick over the armored citadel . Outside the citadel the middle deck was 37 @.@ 5 mm thick and the lower deck was 25 mm thick . Underwater protection was minimal as there was only an unarmored watertight bulkhead behind the upwards extension of the double bottom .

 All three ships were laid down on 30 October 1911 , but this was just a ceremonial event as the design had not yet been finalized nor the contracts signed . A contract was finally signed on 13 April 1912 with Russud that specified delivery dates of 2 September 1915 for both Imperatritsa Mariya and Imperator Aleksander III . Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya was built to a larger design that added over two million gold rubles to her cost and delayed the start of her construction three months after her half @-@ sisters . Despite the demanding schedule the ships suffered from a number of delays during construction . On 10 February 1914 changes were ordered by the Naval Ministry to incorporate the lessons learned from the full @-@ scale armor trials conducted using the Chesma . This added almost 500 long tons ( 508 t ) of weight to the ships and raised their cost by 220 @,@ 000 – 250 @,@ 000 rubles . Other delays were incurred after the war began as imported components took longer to reach the shipyards and factories switched over to war production . The construction of Imperator Aleksander III was deliberately delayed in order to accelerate the completion of her two sisters and some of her turrets were transferred to Imperatritsa Mariya as well .

 Imperatritsa Mariya ( Russian : Императрица Мария , " Empress Maria " ) was launched on 19 October 1913 and arrived in Sevastopol on 13 July 1915 , where she completed her fitting out during the next few months and conducted sea trials . She provided cover while the pre @-@ dreadnought battleships conducted shore bombardment missions in October 1915 . She encountered the ex @-@ German light cruiser Midilli twice during 1916 , but the cruiser escaped with nothing more than splinter damage . On 20 October 1916 , she capsized and sank in Sevastopol harbor after a magazine fire and subsequent explosion . Following a complex salvage operation , she was eventually raised and placed in drydock in May 1918 . However , in the chaos of the Russian Revolution and subsequent Civil War , no further repair work was done , and the ship was scrapped beginning in 1926 . Her guns and their turrets , which had fallen out of the ship when she capsized , were later salvaged in 1931 – 33 . Two of the guns were used in the 30th Coast Defense Battery defending Sevastopol during World War II , also known as Maksim Gor 'kii I by the Germans . 
 = = = Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya = = = 
 Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya ( Russian : Императрица Екатерина Великая , " Empress Catherine the Great " ) was launched on 6 June 1914 and completed on 18 October 1915 . She was originally named Ekaterina II until 27 June 1915 and was renamed Free Russia ( Russian : Svobodnaya Rossiya ) in 1917 . She engaged the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben while the latter was in Turkish service as Yavuz Sultan Selim only once , but failed to inflict anything more severe than splinter damage . She also encountered Midilli on 16 April 1916 , but the cruiser used her higher speed to escape . She was scuttled on 18 June 1918 in Novorossiysk to prevent her from being turned over to the Germans as required by the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk . No attempt was made to salvage her during the 1920s , but the 12 @-@ inch shells were salvaged from her wreck until a magazine explosion was triggered in 1930 by the explosive charges used to gain access to the shells . 
 = = = Imperator Aleksander III = = = 
 Imperator Aleksander III ( Russian : Император Александр <unk> , " Emperor Alexander III " ) was launched on 2 April 1914 , renamed Freedom ( Russian : <unk> — Volia ) in 1917 and then General Alekseyev ( Russian : Генерал <unk> ) in 1920 . The ship did not take part in operations during World War I due to long delays in the delivery of its machinery from Britain , but was able to go to sea by 1917 and conduct a series of trials . On 1 May 1918 she sailed from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk to avoid capture by advancing German troops . While at Novorossiysk she received an order to scuttle on 19 June 1918 , but the majority of the crew refused to do so and decided to return to Sevastopol . Upon arrival she was disarmed and only guards were left on board , but the Germans took control on 1 October . She made a brief cruise with a German crew on 15 October , but her guns were still inoperable . After Germany 's surrender she was turned over to the British , who moved her to İzmit in Turkey . In 1919 the British brought her back to the Black Sea and turned her over to the White Russian forces , where she fought in the Russian Civil War against the Red Army , mainly carrying out shore bombardments . With the collapse of the White Russian armies in Southern Russia in 1920 , the battleship assisted in their evacuation to French @-@ owned Tunisia , where she was interned in Bizerte . She was eventually scrapped there to pay her docking fees . 
 The French stored her guns and later donated them to the Finns during the Winter War , although they did not arrive until after the end of the war . The Germans captured four of these 12 @-@ inch and some 130 mm guns in transit in Narvik harbor when they invaded Norway in April 1940 . Both the Finns and Germans used these guns as coastal artillery . The Germans emplaced all four guns , after rebuilding them to accept German ammunition , in armored turrets in ' Batterie <unk> ' on Guernsey . The Finns used three of the 12 @-@ inch guns to repair railway guns that had fallen into their hands in 1941 . They were used throughout the Continuation War and the Finns were forced in 1944 to surrender them to the Soviets who used them until the 1990s . 
 = Ben Paschal = 
 Benjamin Edwin " Ben " Paschal ( October 13 , 1895 – November 10 , 1974 ) was an American baseball outfielder who played eight seasons in Major League Baseball from 1915 to 1929 , mostly for the New York Yankees . After two " cup of coffee " stints with the Cleveland Indians in 1915 and the Boston Red Sox in 1920 , Paschal spent most of his career as the fourth outfielder and right @-@ handed pinch hitter of the Yankees ' Murderers ' Row championship teams of the late 1920s . Paschal is best known for hitting .360 in the 1925 season while standing in for Babe Ruth , who missed the first 40 games with a stomach ailment . 
 During his time in baseball , Paschal was described as a five @-@ tool player , who excelled at running , throwing , fielding , hitting for average and power . However , his playing time with the Yankees was limited because they already had future Baseball Hall of Famers Ruth and Earle Combs , and star Bob Meusel , in the outfield . Paschal was considered one of the best bench players in baseball during his time with the Yankees , and sportswriters wrote how he would have started for most other teams in the American League . He was one of the best pinch hitters in the game during the period , at a time when the term was still relatively new to baseball . 
 = = Early career = = 
 The son of farmers , Paschal was born in Enterprise , Alabama and grew up in nearby Sanford . He played collegiate sports at the University of Alabama , before beginning his professional career with Dothan of the Georgia State League , where he played with future Hall of Fame player Bill Terry . Paschal played in 64 games , with a .280 batting average , and his ability attracted the attention of scouts in the area . Signed as a pinch hitter for the Cleveland Indians at age 19 , Paschal appeared in nine games , collecting one hit on August 16 , which broke up a no @-@ hitter by Bernie Boland with two outs in the ninth inning . The Indians declared Paschal too inexperienced , and he was sent to the Muskegon Reds of the Central League . The league disbanded in the middle of the 1917 season , and Paschal became a free agent . 
 After a two @-@ year break from baseball because of World War I , Paschal moved on to the Charlotte Hornets of the South Atlantic League , where he played from 1920 to 1923 . He finished third in the league in batting average in 1920 . While in the Southern League , he was nicknamed " the man who hits sticks of dynamite " . 
 At the conclusion of 1920 season , Paschal was purchased by the Boston Red Sox , with an option to keep him if he met certain playing expectations . He appeared in nine games for the Red Sox ; his first game brought three hits against pitcher José Acosta of the Washington Senators , and in total he batted .357 with five runs batted in ( RBI ) , but the Red Sox believed he lacked fielding experience and he returned to Charlotte . In August 1921 , Paschal was sold to the Rochester Red Wings . However , while sliding in a match on August 20 , 1921 , he suffered a broken leg which sidelined him for the rest of the season and voided the contract with the Red Wings . He was hitting .317 at the time of the injury . In 1922 , Paschal played in 142 games , hitting .326 with 18 home runs and improved these figures in 1923 , achieving 200 hits , 22 triples and 26 home runs in 141 games for a batting average of .351 , the fourth best in the league . Paschal began the 1924 season with the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association . He scored 136 runs , while batting .341 and stealing 24 bases . 
 = = Yankees career = = 
 The New York Yankees bought Paschal from the Crackers near the end of the 1924 season and he played in four games . His only three hits , as well as three RBI , came in a defeat by Detroit Tigers on September 19 . 
 During spring training , Paschal narrowly escaped serious injury which travelling on a bus . The vehicle rolled backwards down a hill and Paschall , along with several other teammates , jumped off the bus before it hit a tree at high speed . The media expected Paschal to be Babe Ruth 's understudy prior to the 1925 season , but Ruth collapsed at an Asheville , North Carolina train station just before the regular season 's start . Emergency surgery for a " intestinal abscess " left him hospitalized for six weeks . Originally , Paschal was only to be used against left @-@ handed pitchers , but Yankees manager Miller Huggins named him as Ruth 's temporary replacement in the outfield . In the first game of the year , Paschal hit a home run in a 5 – 1 win against the defending World Series @-@ champion Washington Senators . After another game @-@ winning home run against the Senators two weeks later , the New York press noted that he was " making fans forget about Babe Ruth " . Paschal 's weakness against right @-@ handed pitchers prompted the Yankees to acquire veteran outfielder Bobby Veach , but his declining skills allowed Paschal to retain his position in the team , and another game @-@ winning home run against the Cleveland Indians on May 23 . At the time , Paschal was fifth in the league in batting average at .403 , behind Sammy Hale , Ty Cobb , Tris Speaker , and teammate Earle Combs . His six home runs in May were an equal record ( with Joe Gordon ) for the most home runs hit by a rookie in a month until Shane Spencer achieved nine in September 1998 . 
 Ruth returned to the lineup on June 1 , relegating Paschal to the bench . In July , an injury to Combs allowed Paschal to start several games in center field , and a further injury to Joe Dugan allowed Paschal to start throughout the majority of August and all of September , as Bob Meusel moved to third base to cover Dugan . He hit two home runs during a September 8 game against the Red Sox , but his season ended when he was hit on the leg with a pitch on September 12 against the Philadelphia Athletics . In 89 games , Paschal 's batting average for the season was .360 , 70 points higher than Ruth , with 12 home runs and 56 RBI . 
 Paschal began the 1926 season as the fourth outfielder . He was sent a new contract for the 1926 season , but after threatening to hold out for more money . Paschal signed the new contract on February 17 for an estimated $ 7 @,@ 000 ( 94 @,@ 000 today ) . He began the season as a pinch hitter , but injuries quickly took their toll on the Yankees . Paschal started most of July and August , replacing an injured Meusel , who broke a bone in his right foot . Paschal hit an inside @-@ the @-@ park home run in a victory against the Indians on July 9 . With the Yankees in a close pennant race in mid @-@ August , Paschal hit a home run in a loss to the Detroit Tigers . Further successes came with a vital pinch @-@ hit double in a win against the Athletics on September 6 and a home run on September 8 . The Yankees clinched the pennant on September 15 , and Paschal scored the game @-@ winning single . The Yankees faced the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1926 World Series , and Paschal , pinch @-@ hitting for Joe Dugan , singled in Lou Gehrig tying the contest at 2 – 2 in the ninth inning of Game 5 . Tony Lazzeri hit a sacrifice fly in the tenth to win the game for the Yankees , but they lost the next two games and the Series . He had played in 96 games , hitting seven home runs with 32 runs batted in . 
 Before the 1927 season , Paschal returned his playing contract unsigned because of a salary dispute . By that time , the Yankees were forming the nucleus of what became the Murderers ' Row teams of the late 1920s . He signed for an estimated $ 8 @,@ 000 ( 109 @,@ 000 today ) , a 13 % raise . In the season @-@ opening win against the Athletics , right field starter Babe Ruth struck out twice and popped out , forcing Huggins to replace him with Paschal in the sixth inning . As the last man ever to pinch @-@ hit for Ruth , Paschal singled . In one of his few starts of the 1927 season , Paschal was a single short of hitting for the cycle , and almost had three home runs . Replacing the injured Bob Meusel , Paschal hit two home runs , a triple that was yards shy of a home run , and a double which bounced off the right @-@ field stands during an 11 – 2 rout of the Indians . Paschal did not play in the Yankees ' 1927 World Series victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates . Overall he played in 50 games , primarily as a pinch hitter . After the season , Paschal was discussed as a trade for Boston Red Sox pitcher Red Ruffing , but discussions fell apart ( Ruffing was later acquired in a proposed trade during the 1930 season ) . 
 Paschal was used heavily as a pinch hitter during the 1928 season . Huggins credited Paschal 's timely pinch @-@ hitting as part of the Yankees ' success that season . One of the few highlights of his season was his RBI pinch @-@ hit double in the 10th inning that helped the Yankees beat the Chicago White Sox on August 4 . Paschal played in 65 games that season , having a .316 batting average . He shared center field duties with Cedric Durst for an injured Earle Combs during the Yankees ' win over the Cardinals in the 1928 World Series . He started the first and last games of the series on a platoon situation ; Paschal faced left @-@ handed pitchers and Durst faced right @-@ handed pitchers . 
 Before the 1929 season , Paschal and Durst were mentioned in several trade rumors , and Paschal was rarely used , appearing in only 42 games as a sixth outfielder in the season . A rare start came on June 1 against the White Sox , when he scored a run . On July 2 , Paschal hit a pinch @-@ hit home run for Herb Pennock in the seventh inning of a game against the Red Sox to give the Yankees a 3 – 2 win . He played in 42 games in his final season in the majors , posting a .208 batting average in 81 at @-@ bats . 
 During his time with the Yankees , Paschal was considered a quiet player with a colorless personality . His appearances were limited by the presence of future Hall of Famers Ruth and Combs , and star Bob Meusel in the outfield . He was part a group including Lou Gehrig and Mark Koenig which preferred watching a film to partying after a game ; they were dubbed the team 's " movie crowd " . 
 = = Later career = = 
 After the 1929 season , Paschal was part of a trade for catcher Bubbles Hargrave , with <unk> Moore and Johnny Grabowski , to the St. Paul Saints of the American Association ( AA ) . In one 1930 game against the Toledo Mud Hens , Paschal had four hits and four RBI in a 23 – 4 win that broke the AA record for most runs scored in a game . In 144 games , Paschal finished the 1930 season with 204 hits , 10 home runs and a .350 batting average . The following season , Paschal played 121 games to hit .336 , while his average in 1932 was .325 in 147 games . During one game in the 1932 season , Paschal had three doubles and three singles , tying the AA record for most hits in a game . His skills declined during the 1933 season ; in 130 games he hit just .272 with seven home runs . He left St. Paul and signed as a free agent with the Knoxville Smokies on December 30 , 1933 . The St. Petersburg Evening Independent reported a few months later that Paschal was " struggling to keep his job " in the minors . He was released by Knoxville and signed with the Scranton Miners of the New York – Penn League . After a few games with the Miners , Paschal returned home to North Carolina , where he accepted a managerial job for a semi @-@ professional baseball team in Catawba County . 
 Paschal was married with a child , Ben Jr . He died in Charlotte , North Carolina at the age of 79 , and is interred at Sharon Memorial Park . 
 = 2002 Pacific hurricane season = 
 The 2002 Pacific hurricane season was a slightly above average Pacific hurricane season that saw three tropical cyclones reach Category 5 intensity on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale . The strongest storm this year was Hurricane Kenna , which reached Category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . It made landfall near Puerto Vallarta , located in the Mexican state of Jalisco , on October 25 . The hurricane killed four people and was the third most powerful hurricanes to ever strike the western coast of Mexico , hitting with winds of 140 mph ( as well as the strongest landfall in terms of windspeed since Hurricane Madeline in 1976 ) . Elsewhere , Tropical Storm Julio made landfall in Mexico , and Tropical Storm Boris dumped torrential rain along the Mexican coast , despite remaining offshore . 
 The season officially began on May 15 , 2002 for the Eastern Pacific , and June 1 , 2002 for the Central Pacific . It ended on November 30 for both regions . These dates delimit the time when most tropical cyclones form in this part of the Pacific Ocean . The first system formed on May 24 and the final depression dissipated on November 16 . 
 Other storms were individually unusual . Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category 5 intensity , but neither caused any damage . Hurricane Fausto had no effect on land , but it regenerated into a weak tropical storm at an abnormally high latitude . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The 2002 Pacific hurricane season officially started May 15 , 2002 in the eastern Pacific , and June 1 , 2002 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 2002 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean . In practice , however , the season lasted from May 24 , the formation date of its first system , to November 16 , the dissipation date of the last . 
 There were 15 tropical storms in the eastern Pacific Ocean in the 2002 season . Of those , eight became hurricanes , of which six became major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or higher on the Saffir Simpson Scale . Three reached Category 5 intensity , a record shared with the 1994 season . Four tropical depressions formed and dissipated before reaching the intensity of a tropical storm . In the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility , one tropical storm and two hurricanes formed , with one of the hurricanes intensifying into a major hurricane . In the eastern Pacific proper , the season saw below average activity in terms of the number of total storms and hurricanes , but about average activity in terms of major hurricanes . A moderately strong El Niño , ongoing during the season , may have contributed to the disproportionate number of major hurricanes , as well as reduced activity in the Atlantic . Also of note was an unusual gap in storm formation during the first three weeks of August in this season , <unk> a prime period for tropical cyclone formation . 
 Only three systems , Tropical Storms Boris and Julio and Hurricane Kenna , had significant impact on land . Julio and Kenna caused the only two landfalls this year . Most of the season 's impact , including all casualties and most of the damage , was caused by Kenna . 
 In addition to the above systems , an area of convection persisted near a developing circulation about 575 mi ( 925 km ) west @-@ southwest of Johnston Atoll on July 18 . An upper @-@ level low to the northeast provided outflow , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a tropical cyclone formation alert early on July 19 . Although not classified by the CPHC , the Japan Meteorological Agency remarked that a tropical depression had developed by early on July 20 , just east of the International Date Line . Soon after , it crossed into the western Pacific and briefly intensified into Tropical Storm Kalmaegi .

 = = = Hurricane Alma = = = 
 A complex formation involving a tropical wave and a gale over the Gulf of Tehuantepec formed Tropical Depression One @-@ E on May 24 . It slowly strengthened into the first tropical storm of the season two days later . Alma then turned north , moving near the edge of a subtropical ridge over Mexico . Its rate of intensification picked up , and Alma became a hurricane on May 28 . Alma reached Category 3 intensity on May 30 . The hurricane began to weaken almost immediately thereafter under the influence of wind shear and cool water . Alma rapidly fell apart , and degenerated into a weak low pressure area by June 1 . 
 The hurricane did not impact land . A special feature about Alma was that it was one of only five Pacific major hurricanes in May . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Boris = = = 
 On June 8 , an area of disturbed weather that had absorbed a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Two @-@ E. It became a tropical storm the next day . After peaking on June 9 , with a pressure of 997 mb , steering currents collapsed and Boris stalled out in the ocean between two ridges of high pressure . Shear increased , and the cyclone weakened to a depression on June 10 . The next day , Boris degenerated into a remnant low . The remnant drifted east and then southeast before dissipating on June 12 . 
 Boris dumped heavy rains on sections of the Mexican coast . The maximum amount was 10 @.@ 60 inches ( 269 mm ) at San Felipe <unk> . These rains damaged several homes at an unspecified location . In addition , rainfall damaged several homes in Tequila , Jalisco , but the National Hurricane Center believes that Boris likely did not cause the rain . No deaths were attributed to this storm . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Three @-@ E = = = 
 A tropical wave that crossed Central America organized and developed into a tropical depression on June 27 . Contrary to forecasts , the depression did not strengthen further because of strong wind shear . By June 29 , the depression had become a remnant low , which was observed as a swirl of clouds for a few more days before dissipating . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Cristina = = = 
 An area of disturbed weather near Panama drifted to a location south of Puerto Ángel , Oaxaca , and organized into Tropical Depression Four @-@ E on July 9 . It moved westward through a hostile environment of strong shear . The wind shear disrupted the cyclone 's convection and weakened its circulation . Despite the shear , the depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on July 12 and was named Cristina . This broke down the steering ridge , and Cristina turned to the north and peaked on July 14 . Then , the wind shear won out and Cristina quickly weakened . Cristina dissipated into a swirl of clouds on July 16 , without ever threatening land . No impact was reported . 
 = = = Hurricane Douglas = = = 
 A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on July 8 and crossed the Atlantic without much development . In the Caribbean , showers increased , but wind shear prevented development . The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific on July 16 , and wind shear decreased to allow the convection to organize . Tropical Depression Five @-@ E developed on July 20 about 395 miles ( 636 km ) south of Manzanillo , Mexico . At that time , gradual strengthening was anticipated . The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Douglas . Around that time , most of the deep convection was situated south of the atmospheric circulation . Initially expected to become a hurricane only briefly , late on July 21 , the NHC reported that Douglas had become a hurricane . Upon becoming a hurricane , Douglas was situated in low wind shear environment ; however , Hurricane Douglas was expected to reach cold waters in 36 hours , and thus was not predicted to become a major hurricane . Douglas became a Category 2 hurricane on July 22 , reaching peak winds of 105 miles per hour ( 170 km / h ) . Douglas held this intensity for 18 hours as it traveled westward . When Douglas weakened from its peak intensity , it had an organized cloud pattern , but the thunderstorm activity was weakening , typical of most Pacific hurricanes that reach cooler waters . The weakening briefly stopped after Douglas went through an eyewall replacement cycle , but Douglas was downgraded to a tropical storm late on July 24 as the storm only had a small area of deep convection left . Tropical storm Douglas briefly stopped weakening as convection increased , only to fade away again hours later . The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression early on July 26 , and later that day degenerated into a remnant low pressure area . The remnant low dissipated the next day . 
 = = = Hurricane Elida = = = 
 A tropical wave generated into Tropical Depression Six @-@ E on July 23 . It moved westward and reached storm strength 12 hours after it formed . Elida rapidly deepened , developing a pinhole eye , and becoming a hurricane on July 24 and further reaching major hurricane intensity six hours later . Elida 's rapid intensification continued , becoming a Category 5 hurricane for six hours on July 25 . 
 Despite moving over warm waters , Elida began to weaken because it began an eyewall replacement cycle . When the cycle ended , the cyclone was over cooler water and unsteadily weakened . Elida fell to a tropical storm on July 27 , then degenerated into a remnant low and turned to the northeast . The remnant dissipated over the open ocean about 535 mi ( 861 km ) west of Los Angeles . 
 Elida is one of the fastest intensifying eastern Pacific hurricanes . Its rate of intensification is rivaled only by 1997 's Linda and 2015 's Patricia . Elida had no direct impact on land . However , it did send heavy waves along the shores of Mexico . No one was killed and no damage was reported . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Seven @-@ E = = = 
 A tropical wave that had reached the Eastern Pacific from Africa was first spotted on July 23 . The wave continued westward with little development occurring until August 3 , when convection increased . After additional slow organization , the wave was classified as Tropical Depression Seven @-@ E on August 6 near the tip of Baja California . The system did not strengthen much , and development was halted when wind shear destroyed the system on August 8 . The depression never came near land and hence no one was killed or injured . Like Tropical Depression Three @-@ E , this cyclone was forecast to reach tropical storm intensity , but it never did . 
 = = = Hurricane Fausto = = = 
 After a rather lengthy lull punctuated by only Tropical Depression Seven @-@ E , a tropical wave formed Tropical Depression Eight @-@ E on August 21 . Initially taking a westward track , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Fausto on August 22 . It turned to the west @-@ northwest and stayed on that path for the next six days . Fausto steadily strengthened and intensified into a hurricane on August 22 . It continued to intensify , peaking as a Category 4 on August 24 , and also substantially increased in size . The hurricane began to weaken thereafter , and was a minimal tropical storm by the time it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility on August 27 . The tropical cyclone dropped to a depression and degenerated into a non @-@ convective swirl of clouds on August 28 . 
 Fausto 's remnants passed north of the Hawaiian Islands uneventfully until they interacted with a tropical upper @-@ tropospheric trough ( TUTT ) on August 30 . In combination with warm waters , a tropical depression with some subtropical features developed . At this time it was located around latitude 30 ° N. By September 1 , Fausto had redeveloped into a tiny but tropical <unk> . Its rebirth was brief , however , as a mid @-@ latitude cyclone absorbed the system early on September 3 . 
 Fausto 's regeneration north of Hawaii was unusual but not unprecedented . The other time this happened since 1966 was in the 1975 season . That time , another TUTT absorbed the remnant of Hurricane Ilsa , which led to the formation of an unnamed hurricane at high latitude . Other tropical cyclones have strengthened north of Hawaii , but the actual formation of one is rare . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Alika = = = 
 An area of convection acquired a closed circulation and became Tropical Depression One @-@ C on August 22 . It stayed disorganized for the next several days . It organized more fully and intensified into a tropical storm on August 25 and was named Alika . After peaking as a moderately strong tropical storm on August 25 , wind shear caused by the pre @-@ Ele tropical depression and an upper @-@ level low near Hawaii weakened the storm to a depression on August 27 . Alika dissipated the next day , having never threatened land . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Genevieve = = = 
 A tropical wave formed Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E on August 26 . It was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Genevieve the next day . It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane , peaking in intensity on August 28 . At that point , the cyclone encountered cooler waters , which caused it to weaken slowly , weakening to a depression on August 30 . The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2 . A swirl of remnant clouds persisted for a few more days . Genevieve had no impact on land , with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center . 
 = = = Hurricane Ele = = = 
 An eastern extension of the monsoon trough south of Hawaii organized into Tropical Depression Two @-@ C on August 27 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Ele six hours later . Despite the nearby presence of Alika , Ele developed rapidly and strengthened into a hurricane on August 28 . After contributing to the dissipation of Alika , Ele continued intensifying . It reached Category 2 intensity late on August 28 and quickly became a major hurricane six hours later . The hurricane then crossed the International Date Line and became a typhoon in the 2002 Pacific typhoon season . Typhoon Ele turned to the northwest after crossing the dateline and continued to strengthen . It reached Category 4 before turning north and weakening again . After briefly restrengthening back into a Category 4 , the typhoon weakened and turned to the northwest . Ele was downgraded to a tropical storm on September 7 , a depression on September 9 , and then dissipated shortly afterwards . Ele did not affect land . 
 = = = Hurricane Hernan = = = 
 A weak wave in the ITCZ organized into Tropical Depression Ten @-@ E on August 30 . It headed west @-@ northwest and quickly intensified into a tropical storm and eventually , a hurricane . Hernan then began rapidly deepening , reaching Category 5 intensity on September 1 . It maintained that intensity for 12 hours before tracking over cooler waters . The storm weakened steadily , with wind shear contributing to its deterioration . Hernan then degenerated into a remnant low on September 6 . The low turned to the southwest and dissipated three days later . 
 Hernan passed close enough to Socorro Island to bring strong winds to the island . In addition , the hurricane 's large and powerful wind field caused waves between 12 foot ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) and 20 foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) in height and strong rip currents on the southwest coast of California . Other than the aforementioned regions , Hernan had no significant impact on land . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Eleven @-@ E = = = 
 Of the four tropical depressions this season that did not become named storms , only Eleven @-@ E threatened land . An area of disturbed weather associated with a tropical wave formed into a tropical cyclone on September 5 . It tracked northwestward , before turning southwest . It weakened into a remnant low on September 8 . The remnant turned north and dissipated on September 10 offshore of the Baja California peninsula . The cyclone was nearly a tropical storm when it peaked on September 6 . It was forecast to become a tropical storm and pass close to the peninsula . This prompted a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch . With the weakening of the cyclone the watch and warning were discontinued . No damage or casualties were reported in association with this tropical cyclone . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Iselle = = = 
 Part of the same tropical wave that formed Tropical Depression Seven in the Atlantic basin organized into Tropical Depression Twelve @-@ E on September 15 . It strengthened further into Tropical Storm Iselle the next day . The storm headed northwest and paralleled the coast of Mexico , nearly strengthening into a hurricane late on September 17 . While near its peak intensity , a trough abruptly recurved the system to the northeast . Wind shear also increased , and Iselle consequently fell apart on satellite imagery . It weakened to a depression on September 19 . Iselle then degenerated into a remnant low the next day and rapidly degenerated , dissipating on September 20 . Iselle never made landfall . 
 Iselle threatened parts of southwestern Mexico and warnings and watches were issued for that area . Heavy rains were reported over parts of the Baja California Peninsula . The highest amount of rainfall was 6 @.@ 16 inches ( 156 mm ) at Guadeloupe and Mulege , Baja California Sur . There were no reports of damage or casualties . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Julio = = = 
 An area of convection and disturbed weather , possibly related to outflow from Hurricane Isidore in the Atlantic basin , developed a circulation on September 23 and organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen @-@ E on September 25 . The depression headed northward and strengthened into a tropical storm that same day . Julio turned to the northwest and peaked in <unk> as a <unk> tropical storm near Lázaro Cárdenas , Michoacán . On September 26 , Juli made landfall . The storm rapidly dissipated over Mexico . 
 Three fatalities were reported from Julio . However , in Guerrero , around 100 houses in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo were damaged or washed away by flash flooding . The highest rainfall reported was 16 @.@ 10 inches ( 409 mm ) at Zihuatanejo and La Unión , Guerrero . 
 = = = Hurricane Kenna = = = 
 A disturbance possibly associated with a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen @-@ E on October 22 . It strengthened into a tropical storm that same day and a hurricane on October 23 . The next day , Kenna became the third Category 5 hurricane of the season . A trough over Mexico recurved the hurricane , and it started accelerating towards Mexico . Despite moving over waters that were still warm , wind shear weakened the system to a minimal Category 4 by the time of its landfall over Mexico late on October 25 . Mountainous terrain rapidly weakened Kenna , and the system dissipated early on October 26 . 
 Hurricane Kenna was the third @-@ strongest Pacific hurricane to make landfall on record . It was also the second @-@ strongest October hurricane in any season , and the third strongest Pacific hurricane overall . In San Blas , Nayarit , 8 @,@ 800 people were affected ; 1 @,@ 540 houses were damaged or destroyed , which was 80 % to 90 % of houses in the town . In Santiago <unk> , 3 @,@ 770 houses were damaged . Agriculture in the affected area was disrupted . Farmers required aid , and many fruit crops were destroyed . Tourism in Puerto Vallarta was disrupted , with much of the damage to hotels . Insurance companies reported that Kenna 's total damage was $ 96 million ( 2002 USD ) . 
 Kenna killed four people in Mexico and injured over a hundred . The low death toll is likely due to massive evacuations in San Blas , Nayarit , and elsewhere ahead of the hurricane . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Lowell = = = 
 A weak tropical wave located over the open Pacific Ocean organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen @-@ E on October 22 . It strengthened into a tropical storm the next day . Shortly afterwards , wind shear increased . Lowell 's convection was disrupted , and its center of circulation became exposed . The cyclone crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility on October 26 . The shear relaxed , and the depression restrengthened into a tropical storm . Lowell drifted in slow steering currents until it approached Hurricane Huko . The proximity of Huko caused a gradual weakening in Lowell , and it dissipated on October 31 . 
 = = = Hurricane Huko = = = 
 In late October , an active monsoon trough persisted south of Hawaii along 10 ° N latitude , developing an area of convection on October 24 . Later that day , the disturbance was classified as Tropical Depression Three @-@ C about 850 mi ( 1 @,@ 370 km ) south @-@ southeast of Honolulu . Initially poorly organized , it moved to the north and steadily intensified , becoming Tropical Storm Huko early on October 26 while turning northwestward . Late on October 28 , Huko reached hurricane strength , but its close proximity to Tropical Storm Lowell and a brief increase in wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm on October 30 . Shortly after turning to the west , conditions allowed for Huko to re @-@ attain hurricane strength on October 31 while it was passing around 140 mi ( 225 km ) south of Johnston Atoll . On November 2 , a ridge caused the hurricane to accelerate , and the next day it crossed the International Date Line into the Western Pacific , becoming a typhoon . 
 While passing near Johnston Atoll , the outer rainbands of the hurricane produced wind gusts up to 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) and locally heavy rainfall . The remnants of Huko later reentered the basin , eventually affecting California . The system was responsible for heavy rains , causing flooding along a small stream in Bakersfield . Total damage was approximately $ 23 @,@ 000 ( 2002 USD ) . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Sixteen @-@ E = = = 
 Tropical Depression Sixteen @-@ E formed from a disturbance in the intertropical convergence zone . Despite being located in a hostile environment , it managed to organize into a tropical depression on November 14 . It was briefly forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm . However , wind shear prevented that from occurring . Consequently , the depression degenerated into a remnant low on November 16 and dissipated soon after that .

 = = = Tropical Depression Kalmaegi = = = 
 According to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and Japan Meteorological Agency , on July 17 a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline , and 3 days later it exited CPHC 's area of responsibility ; however , this storm wasn 't included into CPHC database . As it entered into western Pacific , it strengthened as a tropical storm and received the name Kalmaegi . 
 = = Accumulated Cyclone Energy = = 
 Accumulated Cyclone Energy ( ACE ) is a measure of the activity of a hurricane season . It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm @-@ force winds every six hours , summing the results , and dividing that total by 104 . As a tropical cyclone does not have gale @-@ force winds until it becomes a tropical storm , tropical depressions are not included in these tables . For all storms , ACE is given to three significant figures . The ACE in the east Pacific proper ( 140 ° W to North America ) is given ; the ACE in the central Pacific ( the International Date Line to 140 ° W ) is given in parentheses . 
 The table includes the ACE for Ele and Huko accumulated only when those storms were located east of the dateline ; their ACE west of the dateline is part of the totals of the 2002 typhoon season . 
 The National Hurricane Center uses ACE to rank hurricane seasons as above @-@ normal , near @-@ normal , and below @-@ normal . It defines below @-@ normal as having an ACE less than 95 * 104 kn2 ; It defines above normal as having an ACE above 150 * 104 kn2 along with the numbers of any two of the following above average : tropical storms ( 15 ) , hurricanes ( 9 ) , or major hurricanes ( 4 ) ; It defines near @-@ normal as having an ACE between 100 * 104 kn2 and 150 * 104 kn2 , or an ACE above 150 * 104 kn2 with fewer than two of the numbers of the following above average : tropical storms ( 15 ) , hurricanes ( 9 ) , or major hurricanes ( 4 ) . 
 The 2002 season had a total of fifteen tropical storms , eight hurricanes , and 6 major hurricanes . The total ACE of the season was 101 * 104 kn2 in the east Pacific proper . This qualifies the 2002 season as near to slightly above normal .

 The following names were used for named storms that formed in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean during 2002 . The names not retired from this list were used again in the 2008 season . This is the same list used for the 1996 season . Names that were not assigned are marked in gray . 
 For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility , encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line , all names are used in a series of four rotating lists . The next four names that were slated for use in 2002 are shown below . Three of them , Alika , Ele , and Huko , were used throughout the course of the year .

 = = Plot = = 
 Sheryl Hoover is an overworked mother of two living in Albuquerque , New Mexico . Her brother , Frank , is a scholar of French author Proust and a homosexual , temporarily living at home with the family after having attempted suicide . Sheryl 's husband Richard is a Type A personality striving to build a career as a motivational speaker and life coach . Dwayne , Sheryl 's son from a previous marriage , is a Nietzsche @-@ reading teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he can accomplish his dream of becoming a test pilot . Richard 's foulmouthed father , Edwin , recently evicted from a retirement home for snorting heroin , lives with the family . Olive , the daughter of Richard and Sheryl and the youngest of the Hoover family , is an aspiring beauty queen who is coached by Edwin . 
 Olive learns she has qualified for the " Little Miss Sunshine " beauty pageant that is being held in Redondo Beach , California in two days . Her parents and Edwin , who has been coaching her , want to support her , and Frank and Dwayne cannot be left alone , so the whole family goes . Because they have little money , they go on an 800 @-@ mile road trip in their yellow Volkswagen Type 2 . 
 Family tensions play out on the highway and at stops along the way , amidst the aging VW van 's mechanical problems . When the van breaks down early on , the family learns that they must push the van until it is moving at about 20 mph before it is put into gear , at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in . Later on , the van 's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself . 
 Throughout the road trip , the family suffers numerous personal setbacks and discover their need for each other 's support . Richard loses an important contract that would have jump @-@ started his motivational business . Frank encounters the ex @-@ boyfriend who , in leaving him for an academic rival , had prompted his suicide attempt . Edwin dies from a heroin overdose , resulting in the family smuggling the body out of a hospital and nearly having it discovered by the police . During the final leg of the trip , Dwayne discovers that he is color blind , which means he cannot become a pilot , a realization that prompts him to break his silence , and shout his anger and disdain for his family . 
 The climax takes place at the beauty pageant . After a frantic race against the clock the family arrives at the hotel , and are curtly told by a pageant organizer that they are a couple minutes past the deadline . A sympathetic hired hand instead offers to register Olive on his own time . As Olive prepares for the pageant , the family sees Olive 's competition : slim , hypersexualized pre @-@ teen girls with teased hair and capped teeth . They wear lip gloss , adult @-@ like swimsuits , and glamorous evening wear while performing highly elaborate dance numbers with great panache . It quickly becomes apparent that Olive ( plain , chubby , wearing large eyeglasses , and untrained in beauty pageant conventions ) is a mere amateur by comparison . 
 As Olive 's turn to perform in the talent portion of the pageant draws near , Richard and Dwayne recognize that Olive is certain to be humiliated , and wanting to spare her feelings , run to the dressing room to talk her out of performing . Sheryl , however , insists that they " let Olive be Olive " , and Olive goes on stage . Olive 's hitherto @-@ unrevealed dance that her Grandpa Edwin had choreographed for her is performed to Rick James ' song " Super Freak " . Olive <unk> and horrifies most of the audience and pageant judges with a burlesque performance that she joyfully performs while oblivious to their reactions . The pageant organizers are enraged and demand Sheryl and Richard remove Olive from the stage . Instead of removing her , one by one the members of the Hoover family join Olive on stage , dancing alongside her to show their support . 
 The family is next seen outside the hotel 's security office where they are given their freedom in return for a promise never to enter a beauty pageant in the state of California again . Piling into the van with the horn still honking , they happily smash through the barrier of the hotel 's toll booth and head back to their home in Albuquerque .

 = = Production = = 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 When choosing the cast for the film , directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris were assisted by casting directors Kim Davis and Justine Baddely who had worked with them on previous music videos . The directors had initially settled on Greg Kinnear to portray Richard Hoover . However , for the character of Sheryl Hoover , they considered several actresses before deciding on Australian actress Toni Collette . Davis and Baddely traveled to " every English @-@ speaking country " to search for the actress to portray Olive Hoover , and they finally chose actress Abigail Breslin through an audition when she was six . Paul Dano was cast as Dwayne two years before production began and in preparation for portraying his character , spent a few days taking his own vow of silence . Alan Arkin , who portrayed Edwin Hoover , was initially considered too young for the role . 
 The role of Frank , the suicidal Proust scholar , was originally written for Bill Murray , and there was also studio pressure for Robin Williams . The directing duo chose Steve Carell for the role a few months before filming began , and in an interview revealed : " When we met with Steve Carell , we didn 't know he could do this based upon what he had done . But when we met with him and talked to him about the character , the tone of the movie and the way we were approaching it , he was right on the same page with us " . Although known to Comedy Central viewers for many years as a correspondent on the highly rated satirical news program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , at the time Carell was cast for Little Miss Sunshine , he was relatively unknown in Hollywood . Producers of the film were worried that he was not a big enough star and did not have much acting experience . 
 = = = Script and development = = = 
 The script was written by Michael Arndt and was originally about an East Coast road trip from Maryland to Florida , but was shifted to a journey from New Mexico to California because of budget issues . Arndt started the script on May 23 , 2000 and completed the first rough draft by May 26 . He had initially planned on shooting the film himself by raising several thousand dollars and using a camcorder . Instead , he gave the screenplay to producers Ron Yerxa and Albert Berger who teamed up with Deep River Productions to find a potential director . 
 The producers met directors Dayton and Faris while producing Election and in turn gave the script to them to read in 2001 . The directors commented later on the script stating : " This film really struck a chord . We felt like it was written for us . " The script was purchased from first @-@ time screenwriter Arndt for $ 250 @,@ 000 by Marc Turtletaub , one of the film 's producers , on December 21 , 2001 . Yerxa and Berger remained as producers as they were responsible for finding the directors and cinematographer , assisting in the ending re @-@ shoot , and helping bring the film to the Sundance Film Festival . 
 The film was pitched to several studios , and the only interested studio was Focus Features who wanted to film it in Canada . After the studio attempted to have the film be more centered on the character Richard Hoover , and Arndt disagreed , he was fired and replaced by another writer . The new writer added several scenes , including Richard 's confrontation with the character who dismisses his motivational technique business . A corporate change brought in a new studio head and Arndt was rehired when the new writer left after four weeks of rewriting the script . After two years of pre @-@ production , Focus Features dropped the film in August 2004 . Marc Turtletaub paid $ 400 @,@ 000 to Focus Features to buy back the rights to the film and for development costs . He also paid for the $ 8 million budget , allowing Little Miss Sunshine to then be filmed . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography began on June 6 , 2005 . Filming took place over 30 days in Arizona and southern California , with scenes shot in keeping with the chronological order of the script . Arndt re @-@ wrote the ending to the film six weeks before the film 's release at the Sundance Film Festival , and this was filmed in December 2005 . Post @-@ production was completed four days before its screening on nine screens at the Sundance Film Festival , where it had its premiere . The film was dedicated to Rebecca <unk> , the niece of producer Peter Saraf and an extra in scenes set in the diner and the convenience store , who was killed in a car accident on September 14 , 2005 . 
 = = = = Volkswagen T2 <unk> = = = = 
 When writing the script , Arndt chose the Volkswagen T2 <unk> to use for the road trip based on his experience with the vehicle and its practicality for filming : " I remember thinking , it 's a road trip , what vehicle are you going to put them in ? And [ the ] VW bus just seems logical , just because you have these high ceilings and these clean sight lines where you can put the camera . In the front windshield looking back and seeing everybody . " Five VW <unk> were used for the family car as some were modified for different filming techniques . Three of the vans had engines , and the two without were mounted on trailers . During pre @-@ production , the cinematographer used a basic video camera and set it up at angles inside the van to determine the best locations to shoot from during filming . Many of the problems associated with the van that were included in the plot ( a broken clutch , a stuck horn , and a detached door ) , were based on similar problems that writer Arndt experienced during a childhood trip that involved the same type of vehicle . 
 While filming the scenes where the family pushes the van to get it started , a stunt coordinator was used to ensure the safety of the actors . In an interview , actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving : " I was going like 50 miles an hour in this ' 71 VW van that doesn 't have side air bags . Basically you 'd wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with the camera . ' Okay , go ! ' I mean , it was insanity ; it 's the most dangerous movie I 've ever made . " While filming the scenes in the van , the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for three or four hours a day . For scenes in which Alan Arkin 's character was swearing excessively , Breslin had her headphones on and could not hear the dialogue , just like her character in the film . Only when she saw the film did she know what was being said . On July 25 , 2006 Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening at Vineland Drive @-@ In theater in Industry , California . Over 60 of the vans were present at the screening . 
 = = = = Pageant = = = = 
 Prior to writing the script , Arndt read in a newspaper about Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking to a group of high school students and saying " If there 's one thing in this world I hate , it 's losers . I despise them . " As a result , Arndt developed his script lampooning the thought process : " And I thought there 's something so wrong with that attitude ... I wanted to ... attack that idea that in life you 're going up or you 're going down ... So to a degree a child beauty pageant is the epitome of the ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through . " Co @-@ director Jonathan Dayton also commented on the importance of the pageant to the film : " As far as the pageant goes , it was very important to us that the film not be about pageants . It 's about being out of place , it 's about not knowing where you 're going to end up ... " All the girls acting as participants in the beauty pageant , except Abigail Breslin , were veterans of real beauty pageants . They looked the same and performed the same acts as they had in their real @-@ life pageants . To prepare for filming , the directors attended several pageants in Southern California and met with a coordinator to learn more about the pageant process . A mother of a contestant in the film claimed that the film overplayed practices that the contestants go through : " Most pageants aren ’ t quite like that , with shaving the girls ’ legs , spraying them with fake tans and putting on so much makeup . " 
 When Focus Features initially wanted to film in Canada , the directors opposed it , believing the costs of flying all of the pageant girls and their families would be excessive . The contestants and their families instead spent two weeks filming in a hotel in Ventura with most of the equipment and costumes being provided by the contestants ' parents . To make Breslin 's character the " plump " figure as shown in the film , she had to wear a padded suit during filming . For Olive 's final scene involving her dancing routine , Breslin spent two weeks preparing with a choreographer .

 = = = Academy Awards producers controversy = = = 
 There was some controversy concerning how many producers should receive an award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their work in producing the film . In 1999 , the Academy decided that up to a maximum of three producers are eligible to be included in an award for a film . The rule was implemented to prevent a large number of involved filmmakers to appear on stage when a film was receiving an award . The Producers Guild of America ( PGA ) has not set a limit of producers that can be honored for a film . In the case of Little Miss Sunshine , there were five producers ( Marc Turtletaub , Peter Saraf , Albert Berger , Ron Yerxa , and David Friendly ) and the Academy did not want to include Berger and Yerxa . The two producers were responsible for finding the script , introducing the directors to the other producers , choosing the cinematographer , assisting in the re @-@ shoot of the ending , and helping bring the film to the Sundance Film Festival . The Academy acknowledged that the two were partners in the production process , but declared that only individual producers are recognized by the Academy . Deeming the two producers ' work as a collective effort , the Academy refused to consider either Berger or Yerxa for the award . Producer David Hoberman commented on the support for honoring all five producers , stating " If there are five people actually involved in producing a movie , there 's no reason why someone who 's made a good enough film to be nominated for an Academy Award should be precluded from being rewarded for the work they did . " Lynda Obst who was affiliated with an Academy Award producer committee , also commented : " By and large , five people don 't make a movie . If this is an exception , then it 's a sad situation . But you don 't destroy a rule for an exception . " 
 The PGA had previously honored all five of the producers . Albert Berger , reacting to the Academy 's decision while at a panel for the film , stated " No matter what the academy decided , we produced this movie . " In June 2007 , the Academy announced that they would allow exceptions for films that had more than three producers in the future , stating " The committee has the right , in what it determines to be a rare and extraordinary circumstance , to name any additional qualified producer as a nominee .

 Directors Dayton and Faris were introduced to DeVotchKa 's music after hearing the song " You Love Me " on Los Angeles ' KCRW radio station . The directors were so impressed with the music that they purchased iPods for cast members containing DeVotchKa albums . Mychael Danna was brought in to help arrange the pre @-@ existing material and collaborate with DeVotchKa on new material for the film . The Little Miss Sunshine score was not eligible for Academy Award consideration due to the percentage of material derived from already written DeVotchKa songs .

 = <unk> stingray = 
 The roughtail stingray ( Dasyatis centroura ) is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae , with separate populations in coastal waters of the northwestern , eastern , and southwestern Atlantic Ocean . This bottom @-@ dwelling species typically inhabits sandy or muddy areas with patches of invertebrate cover , at a depth of 15 – 50 m ( 49 – 164 ft ) . It is seasonally migratory , overwintering in offshore waters and moving into coastal habitats for summer . The largest whip @-@ tail stingray in the Atlantic , the roughtail stingray grows up to 2 @.@ 6 m ( 8 @.@ 5 ft ) across and 360 kg ( 800 lb ) in weight . It is plain in color , with an angular , diamond @-@ shaped pectoral fin disc and a long , whip @-@ tail tail bearing a subtle fin fold underneath . The many thorns on its back and tail serve to distinguish it from other stingrays that share its range . 
 Often found lying on the bottom buried in sediment , the roughtail stingray is a generalist predator that feeds on a variety of benthic invertebrates and bony fishes . It is aplacental viviparous , with the embryos receiving nourishment initially from yolk , and later from histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) produced by the mother . In the northwestern Atlantic , females bear an annual litter of 4 – 6 young in fall and early winter , after a gestation period of 9 – 11 months . By contrast , in the Mediterranean there is evidence that females bear two litters of 2 – 6 young per year after a gestation period of only four months . Rays in the northwestern Atlantic are also larger at birth and at sexual maturity than those from the Mediterranean . The venomous tail spine of the roughtail stingray is potentially dangerous to humans . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed this species under Least Concern overall and in the northwestern Atlantic , where it is not commercially utilized . However , in the Mediterranean and southwestern Atlantic it is subject to heavy fishing pressure and has been assessed as Near Threatened . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The first description of the roughtail stingray was published by American naturalist Samuel Mitchell in one of the earliest North American works on ichthyology , a short treatise on the fishes of New York in the 1815 first volume of Transactions of the Literary and Philosophical Society of New York . Mitchell based his account on specimens caught off Long Island , though did not designate any types , and named the new species Raja centroura , from the Greek <unk> ( " <unk> " ) in reference to its thorns . Subsequent authors moved this species to the genus Dasyatis . This ray may also be referred to as rough @-@ tailed stingray , rough @-@ tailed northern stingray , or thorny stingray . 
 The taxonomy of the roughtail stingray is not fully resolved , with the disjunct northwestern Atlantic , southwestern Atlantic , and eastern Atlantic populations differing in life history and perhaps representing a complex of different species . Lisa Rosenberger 's 2001 phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species , based on morphology , found that the roughtail stingray is the sister species to the broad stingray ( D. lata ) , and that they form a clade with the southern stingray ( D. americana ) and the longtail stingray ( D. longa ) . The close relationship between the roughtail and southern stingrays was upheld by a genetic analysis published by Leticia de Almeida <unk> Vaz and colleagues in 2006 . The roughtail and broad stingrays are found in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans respectively , and therefore likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama ( c . 3 Ma ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The roughtail stingray is broadly but discontinuously distributed in the coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean . In the western Atlantic , it occurs from the Georges Bank off New England southward to Florida , the Bahamas , and the northeastern Gulf of Mexico ; there are also scattered reports from Venezuela to Argentina and on the Barrier reef in Belize . In the eastern Atlantic , it occurs from the southern Bay of Biscay to Angola , including the Mediterranean Sea , Madeira , and the Canary Islands . A single record from Quilon , India was likely a misidentification . 
 One of the deepest @-@ diving stingrays , the roughtail stingray has been recorded to a depth of 274 m ( 899 ft ) in the Bahamas and regularly occurs down to 200 m ( 660 ft ) in the Mediterranean . However , it is most common at a depth of 15 – 50 m ( 49 – 164 ft ) . This bottom @-@ dwelling species favors live @-@ bottom habitat ( patches of rough terrain that are densely encrusted by sessile invertebrates ) , and also frequents adjacent open areas of sand or mud . Rays in the northwestern Atlantic do not usually enter brackish water , whereas those off West Africa have been recorded from the lower reaches of large rivers . 
 The favored temperature range of the roughtail stingray is 15 – 22 ° C ( 59 – 72 ° F ) , which is the most important factor determining its distribution . It conducts seasonal migrations off the eastern United States : from December to May , this ray is found over the middle and outer parts of the continental shelf from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to Florida , with larger rays occurring further south than smaller ones . In the spring , the population moves north of the Cape and towards the coast into bays , inlets , and saltier estuaries , though preserving the north @-@ south gradient of body sizes . A similar migration , from shallow coastal waters in summer to deeper offshore waters in winter , apparently occurs in the Mediterranean . Pregnant females tend to be found apart from other individuals . 
 = = Description = = 
 The roughtail stingray has a diamond @-@ shaped pectoral fin disk 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 3 times as wide as long , with straight to gently sinuous margins , rather angular outer corners , and a moderately long , obtuse snout . The eyes are proportionally smaller than other stingrays in its range and immediately followed by larger spiracles . There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a finely fringed posterior margin . The mouth is bow @-@ shaped with a row of six papillae ( nipple @-@ like structures ) across the floor . The seven upper and 12 – 14 lower tooth rows at the center are functional , though the total number of tooth rows is much greater . The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces ; each has a tetragonal base with a blunt crown in juveniles and females , and a pointed cusp in adult males . 
 The pelvic fins have nearly straight margins and angular tips . The tail is long and whip @-@ like , measuring some 2 @.@ 5 times the length of the disc . A long , saw @-@ toothed spine is placed atop the tail at around half a disc length back from the tail base ; sometimes one or two replacement spines are also present in front of the existing one . Behind the spine , there is a long ventral fin fold that is much lower than that of the southern stingray . Individuals under 46 – 48 cm ( 18 – 19 in ) across have completely smooth skin . Larger rays develop increasing numbers of distinctive tubercles or bucklers ( flat @-@ based thorns ) over the middle of the back from the snout to the tail base , as well as dorsal and lateral rows of thorns on the tail . The bucklers vary in size , with the largest of equal diameter to the eye , and may bear up to three thorns each . This species is a uniform dark brown or olive above , and off @-@ white below without dark fin margins . Among the largest members of its family , the roughtail stingray can reach 2 @.@ 6 m ( 8 @.@ 5 ft ) across , 4 @.@ 3 m ( 14 ft ) long , and 360 kg ( 800 lb ) in weight . Females grow larger than males . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The roughtail stingray is reportedly not highly active , spending much time buried in the sediment . It is a generalist predator whose diet generally reflects the most available prey in its environment . It mainly captures prey off the bottom , but also opportunistically takes free @-@ swimming prey . A variety of invertebrates , as well as bony fishes such as sand lance and <unk> , are known to be consumed . Off Massachusetts , the main prey are crabs ( Cancer ) , bivalves ( Mya ) , gastropods ( <unk> ) , squid ( Loligo ) and annelid worms . In Delaware Bay , most of its diet consists of the shrimp <unk> <unk> and the blood worm <unk> <unk> ; the overall dietary composition there is nearly identical to that of bluntnose stingrays ( D. say ) that share the bay . The shrimp <unk> affinis is a major food source off Virginia . Off Florida , crustaceans ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> brevirostris , and Portunus ) and polychaete worms are the most important prey . 
 Sharks and other large fishes , in particular the great hammerhead ( Sphyrna mokarran ) , prey upon the roughtail stingray . The live sharksucker ( Echeneis naucrates ) is sometimes found attached to its body . Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium <unk> , Anthocephalum <unk> , <unk> sp . , <unk> <unk> , <unk> sp . , <unk> <unk> , and Rhinebothrium maccallumi , the monogenean Dendromonocotyle <unk> , and the leech <unk> torpedinis . 
 Like other stingrays , the roughtail stingray is aplacental viviparous : the developing embryo is initially sustained by yolk and later by histotroph ( " uterine milk " , containing proteins , lipids , and mucus ) delivered by the mother through finger @-@ like projections of the uterine epithelium called " trophonemata " . Only the left ovary and uterus are functional in adult females . Off the eastern United States , reproduction occurs on an annual cycle with mating in winter and early spring . After a gestation period of 9 – 11 months , females give birth to 4 – 6 ( typically five ) young in fall or early winter . The newborns measure 34 – 37 cm ( 13 – 15 in ) across . Off North Africa , birthing occurs in June and December , indicating either that females bear two litters per year with a four @-@ month gestation period , or that there are two cohorts of females bearing one litter per year with a ten @-@ month gestation period . The newborns are much smaller than those in the northwestern Atlantic at 8 – 13 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 – 5 @.@ 1 in ) across , which would be consistent with a shorter gestation period . The size at maturity also differs between the two regions : off the eastern United States males and females mature at 130 – 150 cm ( 51 – 59 in ) and 140 – 160 cm ( 55 – 63 in ) across respectively , while off North Africa males and females mature at 80 cm ( 31 in ) and 66 – 100 cm ( 26 – 39 in ) across respectively . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 With its large size and long , venomous spine , the roughtail stingray can inflict a severe wound and can be very dangerous for fishers to handle . However , it is not aggressive and usually occurs too deep to be encountered by beachgoers . It has been reported to damage farmed shellfish beds . The pectoral fins or " wings " are sold for human consumption fresh , smoked , or dried and salted ; the rest of the ray may also be processed to obtain fishmeal and liver oil . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed the roughtail stingray as of Least Concern worldwide , while noting that as a large , slow @-@ reproducing species it is susceptible to population depletion . 
 In the northwestern Atlantic , the roughtail stingray is listed under Least Concern ; it is not targeted or utilized by commercial fisheries , though inconsequential numbers are captured incidentally in trawls and on demersal longlines . Historically , it was sometimes ground up for fertilizer . In the Mediterranean , intensive fishing occurs in the habitat of the roughtail stingray , and it is caught incidentally by artisanal and commercial fishers using trawls , longlines , gillnets , and handlines . Though no specific data is available on this species , declines of other species and its intrinsic susceptibility to depletion have led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in the region . In the southwestern Atlantic , the roughtail stingray and other large rays are heavily fished using demersal trawls , gillnets , longlines , and hook @-@ and @-@ line ; this fishing pressure is liable to increase due to growing commercial interest in using large stingrays for minced fish products . Anecdotal reports suggest that landings of this species are decreasing , leading to a regional assessment of Near Threatened . 
 = John Bull ( locomotive ) = 
 John Bull is a British @-@ built railroad steam locomotive that operated in the United States . It was operated for the first time on September 15 , 1831 , and it became the oldest operable steam locomotive in the world when the Smithsonian Institution operated it in 1981 . Built by Robert Stephenson and Company , the John Bull was initially purchased by and operated for the Camden and Amboy Railroad , the first railroad in New Jersey , which gave John Bull the number 1 and its first name , " Stevens " . ( Robert L. Stevens was president of the Camden and Amboy Railroad at the time . ) . The C & A used the locomotive heavily from 1833 until 1866 , when it was removed from active service and placed in storage . 
 After the C & A 's assets were acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad ( PRR ) in 1871 , the PRR refurbished and operated the locomotive a few times for public displays : it was fired up for the Centennial Exposition in 1876 and again for the National Railway Appliance Exhibition in 1883 . In 1884 the locomotive was purchased by the Smithsonian Institution as the museum 's first major industrial exhibit . 
 In 1939 the employees at the PRR 's Altoona , Pennsylvania , workshops built an operable replica of the locomotive for further exhibition duties , as the Smithsonian desired to keep the original locomotive in a more controlled environment . After being on static display for the next 42 years , the Smithsonian commemorated the locomotive 's 150th birthday in 1981 by firing it up , making it the world 's oldest surviving operable steam locomotive . Today , the original John Bull is on static display once more in the Smithsonian 's National Museum of American History in Washington , D.C. The replica John Bull is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania . 
 = = Construction and initial use = = 
 The John Bull was built in Newcastle , England , by Robert Stephenson and Company for the Camden and Amboy Railroad ( C & A ) , the first railroad built in New Jersey . It was dismantled and then shipped across the Atlantic Ocean in crates aboard the Allegheny . C & A engineer Isaac <unk> reconstructed the locomotive to the best of his ability ( the shipment did not include any drawings or instructions to assemble the locomotive ) and ran it for the first time in September 1831 . On November 12 , 1831 , Robert Stevens ( then president of the C & A ) repaid some political debts by inviting several members of the New Jersey legislature and some local dignitaries , including Napoleon 's nephew Prince Murat , for rides behind the newly delivered locomotive over a short test track . The prince 's wife , Catherine Willis Gray , made a point of hurrying onto the train so she could be declared the first woman to ride a steam @-@ powered train in America . 
 Until the railroad construction was completed , the locomotive was placed in storage ; horse @-@ drawn cars served the construction efforts until 1833 . The C & A applied both numbers and names to their first locomotives , giving this engine the number 1 and officially naming it Stevens ( after the C & A 's first president , Robert L. Stevens ) . However , through regular use of the engine , crews began calling it the old John Bull , a reference to the cartoon personification of England , John Bull . Eventually the informal name was shortened to John Bull and this name was so much more widely used that Stevens fell out of use . 
 In September 1836 the John Bull and two coaches were shipped by canal to Harrisburg , and became the first locomotive to operate there . 
 = = Mechanical modifications and early exhibitions = = 
 Stephenson built the locomotive originally as an 0 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 ( an 0 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no unpowered leading or trailing axles ) . The locomotive 's power was transmitted to the driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels and in front of the front axle . These inside cylinders ' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front axle . 
 Due to poorer quality track than was the norm in its native England , the locomotive had much trouble with derailment ; the C & A 's engineers added a leading truck ( an assembly consisting of an unpowered axle with smaller diameter wheels that was connected to the frame and pushed in front of the locomotive ) to help guide the engine into curves . The leading truck 's mechanism necessitated the removal of the coupling rod between the two main axles , leaving only the rear axle powered . Effectively , the John Bull became a 4 @-@ 2 @-@ 0 ( a locomotive with two unpowered axles , one powered main axle , and no trailing axles ) . Later , the C & A also added a pilot ( " cowcatcher " ) to the lead truck . The cowcatcher is an angled assembly designed to deflect animals and debris off of the railroad track in front of the locomotive . To protect the locomotive 's crew from the weather , the C & A also added walls and a roof ( a cab ) to the rear of the locomotive where the controls were located . C & A workshop crews also added safety features such as a bell and headlight . 
 After several years serving as a switching engine ( a locomotive used for moving railroad cars around within a railroad yard ; also known as a shunter ) and stationary boiler , the John Bull was retired in 1866 and stored in Bordentown , New Jersey . Toward the end of its life in revenue service , the locomotive worked as a pump engine and as the power for a sawmill . 
 The C & A was soon absorbed into the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company ( 1869 ) which itself was merged into the Pennsylvania Railroad ( PRR ) in 1871 . The PRR saw the potential publicity to be gained by exhibiting such an old engine , showing it at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia ; PRR workshop staff then " back @-@ dated " the engine ( by replacing some original parts with parts that " looked " old or by removing them entirely ) . The exhaust stack was replaced with a straight tube of metal and the cab walls and roof were removed . The PRR then exhibited the engine in 1883 at the National Railway Appliance Exhibition in Chicago , Illinois . In 1885 , the Smithsonian Institution accepted the donation of the John Bull from the PRR as the Institution 's first large engineering artifact . 
 = = Smithsonian Institution and locomotive restoration = = 
 At the exhibition in 1883 , the Pennsylvania Railroad ended up resolving two problems at once . In the Smithsonian Institution , the railroad was able to find a home for the historic locomotive , as well as a suitable new employer for a young civil engineer named J. <unk> Watkins . Watkins had been involved in an accident on the railroad in New Jersey a few years before the exhibition . He had lost a leg in the accident , so he was no longer suited to the physical demands of railroad work , although the railroad did employ him as a clerk for a while after his accident . The PRR employed his engineering experience as an expert curator for the Smithsonian 's new Arts and Industries Building , which was opened in 1880 . The locomotive 's first public exhibition at the Smithsonian occurred on December 22 , 1884 , where it was displayed in the East Hall of the Arts and Industries building . 
 The locomotive remained on display in this location for nearly 80 years , but it was transported for display outside the museum on certain rare occasions . The most significant display in this time occurred in 1893 when the locomotive traveled to Chicago for the World 's Columbian Exposition . The Pennsylvania Railroad , like many other railroads of the time , put on grand displays of their progress ; the PRR arranged for the locomotive and a couple of coaches to be delivered to the railroad 's Jersey City , New Jersey , workshops where it would undergo a partial restoration to operating condition . The PRR was planning an event worthy of the locomotive 's significance to American railroad history — the railroad actually planned to operate the locomotive for the entire distance between New Jersey and Chicago . 
 The restoration was supervised by the PRR 's chief mechanical officer , Theodore N. Ely . Ely was confident enough in its 50 @-@ mile ( 80 @.@ 5 km ) test run to Perth Amboy , New Jersey ( which took two hours and fifteen minutes ) , that the governors of all the states that the locomotive was to pass through and the then President of the United States , Grover Cleveland , were invited to ride behind the engine on its first leg toward Chicago . The John Bull was to pull a few passenger cars in a train that would carry dignitaries and representatives of the press . The train traveled to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , in the charge of one locomotive crew . From Philadelphia , local engineers ( train drivers ) were employed to ride on the locomotive 's footplate as pilots to advise the operators for the trip over the local engineers ' territories for the rest of the journey to Chicago . Traveling at 25 to 30 miles per hour ( 40 to 48 km / h ) , the train departed from the Pennsylvania Railroad 's Jersey City station at 10 : 16 a.m. on April 17 and reached Chicago on April 22 . The locomotive operated during the exhibition giving rides to the exhibition 's attendees , and then the train left Chicago on December 6 for the return trip to Washington . The locomotive arrived back in Washington on December 13 . 
 In 1927 the John Bull again traveled outside the museum . The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was celebrating its centenary that year in its Fair of the Iron Horse in Baltimore , Maryland . Since the locomotive 's original tender ( fuel and water car ) had deteriorated beyond repair and was dismantled in 1910 , the PRR built a replica of the tender at its Altoona , Pennsylvania , workshops . The locomotive was also refurbished in Altoona for operation during the fair . This fair was the last steam up for the locomotive until 1980 . 
 = = ( Mostly ) static display = = 
 After the locomotive returned to the Smithsonian , it remained on static display . In 1930 the museum commissioned the Altoona Works to build a second replica of the locomotive 's tender for display with the locomotive in the museum . This time , however , the replica tender re @-@ used some of the fittings that the museum had retained when the original tender was dismantled twenty years earlier . 
 The Smithsonian recognized the locomotive 's age in 1931 , but , since the museum didn 't have the funds to refurbish the locomotive for full operation again , it was decided to run the locomotive in place ( with the driving wheels lifted off the rails using jacks ) with compressed air . The museum borrowed an 1836 coach from the Pennsylvania Railroad to display on the track behind the newly rebuilt tender , and the locomotive 's 100th birthday was officially celebrated on November 12 , 1931 . The locomotive 's semi @-@ operation was broadcast over the CBS radio network with Stanley Bell narrating the ceremonies for the radio audience . 
 The PRR again borrowed the locomotive from 1933 to 1934 for the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago . Unlike its earlier jaunt to Chicago , for this trip , the railroad hauled and displayed it as a static exhibit . While this exhibit was progressing , the Altoona Works were busy again building a replica ; this time the replica was an operable copy of the locomotive . The replica was then operated in 1940 at the New York World 's Fair , while the original locomotive and rebuilt tender returned to the Smithsonian . 
 The original locomotive was displayed outside the museum one more time in 1939 at the New York World 's Fair , but the museum 's curators decided that the locomotive was becoming too fragile for repeated outside exhibits . It was then placed in somewhat permanent display back in the East Hall where it remained for the next 25 years . In 1964 the locomotive was moved to its current home , the National Museum of American History , then called the Museum of History and Technology . 
 The John Bull had remained on static display for another 15 years , but the locomotive 's significance as one of the oldest locomotives in existence , or its use on the first railroad in New Jersey , was not very plainly noted in the display 's literature . As 1981 and the locomotive 's 150th birthday approached , the Smithsonian started discussions on how best to commemorate the locomotive 's age and significance . There was very little question that special publications and exhibits would be prepared , but museum officials were left with the thought that the exhibit could still be so much more than that . 
 Many superficial inspections were performed on the locomotive in 1980 and it was found to be in relatively sound mechanical condition . There wasn 't a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early inspections , and when the wheels were jacked off the rails , as they had been 50 years earlier , the axles were found to be freely operable . One morning in January 1980 , before the museum opened to the public , museum officials used compressed air to power the cylinders and move the wheels through the connecting rods for the first time since its last semi @-@ operation . After the compressed air blew some dirt and debris out of the locomotive 's exhaust stack , it was soon running smoothly . 
 The running gear seemed to be in good order , but it was still unknown if the boiler could still handle the pressure of steam and a live fire again . The museum asked the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company to inspect the locomotive 's boiler for operation . The inspections were conducted after hours at the museum ( from 6 : 30 p.m. to 4 : 00 a.m. ) over three days and included electromagnetic , ultrasonic , and radiographic tests . The tests did reveal a few flaws , but it was projected that the engine could operate at a reduced boiler pressure of 50 psi ( 340 kPa or 3 @.@ 5 kgf / cm ² ) ; as delivered to the Camden & Amboy , the boiler was rated for 70 psi ( 480 kPa ) or 4 @.@ 9 kgf / cm ² . The Smithsonian 's staff , after a few further hydrostatic tests , were confident that the locomotive could again operate under its own power . The items that needed repair were repaired , and on Oct. 14 , 1980 , the locomotive was successfully field @-@ tested on the Warrenton Branch Line in Fauquier County between Calverton and Casanova , Virginia . The site was selected , because at the time , only one freight train per week used the branch line . On September 15 , 1981 , the locomotive operated under steam on a few miles of branch line near the Potomac River within Washington , D.C. With this exhibition , the locomotive became the oldest operable steam locomotive ( and oldest self @-@ propelled vehicle ) in the world . 
 The original John Bull is housed on static display at the National Museum of American History in Washington , D.C. The replica of the John Bull , built in 1939 , is owned and preserved by the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania and is , as of 2009 , their only operational piece of equipment .

 = Kashrut = 
 Kashrut ( also <unk> or <unk> , <unk> ) is the set of Jewish religious dietary laws . Food that may be consumed according to <unk> ( Jewish law ) is termed kosher / <unk> / in English , from the Ashkenazi pronunciation of the Hebrew term <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " fit " ( in this context , fit for consumption ) . 
 Among the numerous laws that form part of kashrut are the prohibitions on the consumption of unclean animals ( such as pork , shellfish ( both Mollusca and Crustacea ) and most insects , with the exception of certain species of kosher locusts ) , mixtures of meat and milk , and the commandment to slaughter mammals and birds according to a process known as shechita . There are also laws regarding agricultural produce that might impact on the suitability of food for consumption . 
 Most of the basic laws of kashrut are derived from the Torah 's Books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy . Their details and practical application , however , are set down in the oral law ( eventually codified in the Mishnah and Talmud ) and elaborated on in the later rabbinical literature . While the Torah does not state the rationale for most kashrut laws , many reasons have been suggested , including philosophical , practical and hygienic . 
 Over the past century , there have developed numerous rabbinical organizations that certify products , manufacturers , and restaurants as kosher , usually using a symbol ( called a hechsher ) to indicate their support . Currently , about a sixth of American Jews or 0 @.@ 3 % of the American population fully keep kosher , and many more abstain from some non @-@ kosher foods , especially pork . 
 = = Explanations = = 
 = = = Philosophical = = = 
 Jewish philosophy divides the 613 mitzvot into three groups — laws that have a rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies ( <unk> ) , laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah 's command ( <unk> ) , and laws that do not have a rational explanation ( <unk> ) . Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws for which there is no particular explanation , since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions . In this line of thinking , the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God 's authority , and man must obey without asking why . However , Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah . 
 Some theologians have said that the laws of kashrut are symbolic in character : Kosher animals represent virtues , while non @-@ kosher animals represent vices . The 1st century BCE Letter of Aristeas argues that the laws " have been given ... to awake pious thoughts and to form the character " . This view reappears in the work of the 19th century Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch . 
 The Torah prohibits " seething the kid ( goat , sheep , calf ) in its mother 's milk " . While the Bible does not provide a reason , it has been suggested that the practice was perceived as cruel and insensitive . 
 Hasidism believes that everyday life is imbued with channels connecting with Divinity , the activation of which it sees as helping the Divine Presence to be drawn into the physical world ; Hasidism argues that the food laws are related to the way such channels , termed sparks of holiness , interact with various animals . These sparks of Holiness are released whenever a Jew manipulates any object for a holy reason ( which includes eating ) ; however , not all animal products are capable of releasing their sparks of holiness . The Hasidic argument is that animals are imbued with signs that reveal the release of these sparks , and the signs are expressed in the biblical categorization of ritually clean and ritually unclean . 
 According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham , the purpose of kashrut was to help Jews maintain a distinct and separate existence from other peoples ; he says that the effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non @-@ Jews , preventing Jewish identity from being diluted . Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair , this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews . 
 = = = Medical = = = 
 There have been attempts to provide empirical support for the view that Jewish food laws have an overarching health benefit or purpose , one of the earliest being from Maimonides in his Guide for the Perplexed . In 1953 , David Macht , an Orthodox Jew and proponent of the theory of biblical scientific foresight , conducted toxicity experiments on many kinds of animals and fish . His experiment involved <unk> seedlings being supplied with extracts from the meat of various animals ; Macht reported that in 100 % of cases , extracts from ritually unclean meat inhibited the seedling 's growth more than that from ritually clean meats . At the same time , these explanations are controversial . Scholar Lester L. <unk> , writing in the Oxford Bible Commentary on Leviticus , says " [ a ] n explanation now almost universally rejected is that the laws in this section [ Leviticus 11 – 15 ] have hygiene as their basis . Although some of the laws of ritual purity roughly correspond to modern ideas of physical cleanliness , many of them have little to do with hygiene . For example , there is no evidence that the ' unclean ' animals are intrinsically bad to eat or to be avoided in a Mediterranean climate , as is sometimes asserted . " 
 = = Prohibited foods = = 
 The laws of kashrut can be classified according to the origin of the prohibition ( Biblical or rabbinical ) and whether the prohibition concerns the food itself or a mixture of foods . 
 Biblically prohibited foods include : 
 Non @-@ kosher animals and birds ( based on Leviticus 11 : 3 – 8 and Deuteronomy 14 : 3 – 21 ) : mammals require certain identifying characteristics ( cloven hooves and being ruminants ) , while birds require a tradition that they can be consumed . Fish require scales and fins ( thus excluding catfish , for instance ) . All invertebrates are non @-@ kosher apart from certain types of locust , on which most communities lack a clear tradition . No reptiles or amphibians are kosher . 
 Carrion ( <unk> ) : meat from a kosher animal that has not been slaughtered according to the laws of shechita . 
 Injured ( <unk> ) : an animal with a significant defect or injury , such as a fractured bone or particular types of lung adhesions . 
 Blood ( dam ) : blood of kosher mammals and fowl is removed through salting , with special procedures for the liver , which is very rich in blood . 
 Particular fats ( <unk> ) : particular parts of the abdominal fat of cattle , goats and sheep must be removed by a process called <unk> . 
 The twisted nerve ( <unk> <unk> ) : the sciatic nerve , as according to Genesis 32 : 32 the patriarch Jacob 's was damaged when he fought with an angel , cannot be eaten and is removed by <unk> . 
 Limb of a living animal ( ever min ha @-@ chai ) : in Genesis 9 : 4 , God forbade Noah and his descendants to consume a limb torn from a live animal . Hence , Jewish law considers this prohibition applicable even to non @-@ Jews , and therefore , a Jew may not give or sell such meat to a non @-@ Jew . 
 <unk> food ( <unk> ) : produce of the Land of Israel requires the removal of certain tithes , which in ancient times were given to the <unk> ( priests ) , <unk> and the poor ( <unk> , maaser <unk> and maaser ani respectively ) or taken to the Old City of Jerusalem to be eaten there ( maaser <unk> ) . 
 Fruit during the first three years ( <unk> ) : according to Leviticus 19 : 23 , fruit from a tree in the first three years after planting cannot be consumed ( both in the Land of Israel and the diaspora ) . This applies also to the fruit of the vine — grapes , and wine produced from them . 
 New grain ( <unk> ) : in Leviticus 23 : 14 the Bible prohibits newly grown grain ( planted after Passover the previous year ) until the second day of Passover ; there is debate as to whether this law applies to grain grown outside the Land of Israel . 
 Wine of libation ( <unk> <unk> ) : wine that may have been dedicated to idolatrous practices . 
 Biblically prohibited mixtures include : 
 Mixtures of meat and milk ( <unk> be @-@ chalav ) : this law derives from the broad interpretation of the commandment not to " cook a kid in its mother 's milk " ( Exodus 23 : 19 , Exodus 34 : 26 , and Deuteronomy 14 : 21 ) ; other non @-@ kosher food may be used for other benefit ( e.g. sold to non @-@ Jews ) , but mixtures of meat and milk are prohibited even with regards to other benefit . 
 Plants grown together ( <unk> ) : in the Land of Israel plants are to be grown separately and not in close proximity according to Leviticus 19 : 19 and Deuteronomy 22 : 9 – 11 . A specific subdivision of this law is kil 'ei ha @-@ <unk> , the prohibition of planting any grain of vegetable near a grapevine ; this law applies to Jews throughout the world , and one may not derive benefit from the produce . 
 <unk> prohibited foods include : 
 Non @-@ Jewish milk ( chalav akum ) : milk that may have an admixture of milk from non @-@ kosher animals ( see below for current views on this prohibition ) . 
 Non @-@ Jewish cheese ( <unk> akum ) : cheese that may have been produced with non @-@ kosher rennet . 
 Non @-@ Jewish wine ( <unk> <unk> ) : wine that while not produced for idolatrous purposes may otherwise have been poured for such a purpose or alternatively when consumed will lead to intermarriage . 
 Food cooked by a non @-@ Jew ( bishul akum ) : this law was enacted for concerns of intermarriage . 
 Non @-@ Jewish bread ( pat akum ) : this law was enacted for concerns of intermarriage . 
 Health risk ( <unk> ) : certain foods and mixtures are considered a health risk , such as mixtures of fish and meat . 
 = = = Permitted and forbidden animals = = = 
 Only meat from particular species is permissible . Mammals that both chew their cud ( ruminate ) and have cloven hooves can be kosher . Animals with one characteristic but not the other ( the camel , the hyrax , and the hare because they have no cloven hooves , and the pig because it does not ruminate ) are specifically excluded ( Leviticus 11 : 3 – 8 ) . In 2008 , a rabbinical ruling determined that giraffes and their milk are eligible to be considered kosher . The giraffe has both split hooves and chews its cud , characteristics of animals considered kosher . Findings from 2008 show that giraffe milk <unk> , meeting kosher standards . Although kosher , the giraffe is not slaughtered today because the process would be very costly . Giraffes are difficult to restrain , and their use for food could cause the species to become endangered . 
 Non @-@ kosher birds are listed outright ( Deuteronomy 14 : 12 – 18 ) but the exact zoological references are disputed and some references refer to families of birds ( 24 are mentioned ) . The Mishnah refers to four signs provided by the sages . First , a <unk> ( predatory bird ) is not kosher . Additionally , kosher birds possess three physical characteristics : an extra toe in the back ( which does not join the other toes in supporting the leg ) , a <unk> ( crop ) , and a <unk> ( gizzard ) with a <unk> lumen . However , individual Jews are barred from merely applying these regulations alone ; an established tradition ( <unk> ) is necessary to allow birds to be consumed , even if it can be substantiated that they meet all four criteria . The only exception to this is turkey . There was a time when certain authorities considered the signs enough , so Jews started eating this bird without a <unk> because it possesses all the signs ( <unk> in Hebrew ) . 
 Fish must have fins and scales to be kosher ( Leviticus 11 : 9 – 12 ) . Shellfish and other non @-@ fish water fauna are not kosher . Here is a list of kosher species of fish . Insects are not kosher except for certain species of kosher locust . Generally any animal that eats other animals , whether they kill their food or eat carrion ( Leviticus 11 : 13 – 31 ) , is not kosher , as well as any animal that was partially eaten by other animals ( Exodus 22 : 30 @-@ 31 ) . 
 = = = Separation of meat and milk = = = 
 Meat and milk ( or derivatives ) cannot be mixed in the sense that meat and dairy products are not served at the same meal , served or cooked in the same utensils , or stored together . Observant Jews have separate sets of dishes , and sometimes different kitchens , for meat and milk , and wait anywhere between one and six hours after eating meat before consuming milk products . The <unk> and <unk> ( lit. milky and meaty ) utensils and dishes are the commonly referred to Yiddish delineations between dairy and meat ones respectively . 
 = = = Kosher slaughter = = = 
 Mammals and fowl must be slaughtered by a trained individual ( a shochet ) using a special method of slaughter , shechita ( Deuteronomy 12 : 21 ) . Among other features , shechita slaughter severs the jugular vein , carotid artery , esophagus , and trachea in a single continuous cutting movement with an unserrated , sharp knife . Failure of any of these criteria renders the meat of the animal unsuitable . The body must be checked after slaughter to confirm that the animal had no medical condition or defect that would have caused it to die of its own accord within a year , which would make the meat unsuitable . These conditions ( <unk> ) include 70 different categories of injuries , diseases , and abnormalities whose presence renders the animal non @-@ kosher . It is forbidden to consume certain parts of the animal , such as certain fats ( <unk> ) and the sciatic nerves from the legs . As much blood as possible must be removed ( Leviticus 17 : 10 ) through the <unk> process ; this is usually done through soaking and salting the meat , but the liver , as it is rich in blood , is grilled over an open flame . Fish ( and kosher locusts , for those who follow the traditions permitting them ) must be killed before being eaten , but no particular method has been specified in Jewish law . Legal aspects of ritual slaughter are governed not only by Jewish law but civil law as well . 
 = = = Kosher utensils = = = 
 Utensils used for non @-@ kosher foods become non @-@ kosher , and make even otherwise kosher food prepared with them non @-@ kosher . Some such utensils , depending on the material they are made from , can be made suitable for preparing kosher food again by immersion in boiling water or by the application of a blowtorch . Food prepared in a manner that violates the Shabbat ( Sabbath ) may not be eaten ; although in certain instances it is permitted after the Shabbat is over . 
 = = = Passover laws = = = 
 Passover has special dietary rules , the most important of which is the prohibition on eating leavened bread or derivatives of this , which are known as chametz . This prohibition is derived from Exodus 12 : 15 . Utensils used in preparing and serving chametz are also forbidden on Passover unless they have been ritually cleansed ( <unk> ) . Observant Jews often keep separate sets of meat and dairy utensils for Passover use only . In addition , some groups follow various eating restrictions on Passover that go beyond the rules of kashrut , such as not eating <unk> or garlic . 
 = = = Produce of the Land of Israel = = = 
 Biblical rules also control the use of agriculture produce . For produce grown in the Land of Israel a modified version of the biblical tithes must be applied , including <unk> <unk> , Maaser Rishon , Maaser <unk> , and Maaser Ani ( <unk> produce is called <unk> ) ; the fruit of the first three years of a tree 's growth or replanting are forbidden for eating or any other use as <unk> ; produce grown in the Land of Israel on the seventh year obtains k <unk> <unk> 'it , and unless managed carefully is forbidden as a violation of the <unk> ( Sabbatical Year ) . Some rules of kashrut are subject to different rabbinical opinions . For example , many hold that the rule against eating <unk> ( new grain ) before the 16th of the month Nisan does not apply outside the Land of Israel . 
 = = = Vegetables = = = 
 Many vegetarian restaurants and producers of vegetarian foods acquire a hechsher , certifying that a Rabbinical organization has approved their products as being kosher . The hechsher usually certifies that certain vegetables have been checked for insect infestation and steps have been taken to ensure that cooked food meets the requirements of bishul Yisrael . Vegetables such as spinach and cauliflower must be checked for insect infestation . The proper procedure for inspecting and cleaning varies by species , growing conditions , and views of individual rabbis . 
 = = = Pareve foods = = = 
 Some processes convert a meat or dairy product into a pareve ( neither meat nor dairy ) one . For example , rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings , yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese , but such cheeses might not be acceptable to some vegetarians , who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet . The same applies to kosher gelatin , an animal product , derived from kosher animal sources . Other gelatin @-@ like products from non @-@ animal sources such as agar agar and <unk> are pareve by nature . Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore ( like all kosher fish products ) pareve . Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product . 
 Kashrut has procedures by which equipment can be cleaned of its previous non @-@ kosher use , but that might be inadequate for those with allergies , vegetarians , or adherents to other religious statutes . For example , dairy manufacturing equipment can be cleaned well enough that the rabbis grant pareve status to products manufactured with it . Nevertheless , someone with a strong allergic sensitivity to dairy products might still react to the dairy residue , and that is why some products that are legitimately pareve carry " milk " warnings . 
 = = = Genetically modified foods = = = 
 With the advent of genetic engineering , a whole new type of food has been brought into the world , and scholars in both academia and Judaic faith have differing viewpoints on whether these new strains of foods are to be considered kosher or not . The first genetically modified animal approved by the FDA for human consumption is the <unk> salmon , and while salmon is normally an acceptably kosher food , this modified organism has a gene from a <unk> organism . 
 Some put forth that this intermixing of species is against the teachings of the Talmud and thus against Jewish Law and <unk> . Others argue that the one in sixty parts law of kashrut is of significance , and that the foreign gene accounts for the less than 1 / 60 of the animal and thus the modified salmon is kosher . 
 = = Supervision and marketing = = 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Certain foods must be prepared in whole or in part by Jews . This includes grape wine , certain cooked foods ( bishul akum ) , cheese ( g <unk> akum ) , and according to some also butter ( <unk> 'at akum ) ; dairy products ( Hebrew : <unk> ישראל chalav Yisrael " milk of Israel " ) ; and bread ( Pas Yisroel ) . 
 = = = Product labeling standards = = = 
 Although reading the label of food products can identify obviously non @-@ kosher ingredients , some countries allow manufacturers to omit identification of certain ingredients . Such " hidden " ingredients may include lubricants and flavorings , among other additives ; in some cases , for instance , the use of natural flavorings , these ingredients are more likely to be derived from non @-@ kosher substances . Furthermore , certain products , such as fish , have a high rate of mislabeling , which may result in a non @-@ kosher fish being sold in a package labeled as a species of kosher fish . 
 Producers of foods and food additives can contact Jewish religious authorities to have their products certified as kosher : this involves a visit to the manufacturing facilities by an individual rabbi or a committee from a rabbinic organization , who will inspect the production methods and contents , and if everything is sufficiently kosher a certificate would be issued . 
 Manufacturers sometimes identify the products that have received such certification by adding particular graphical symbols to the label . These symbols are known in Judaism as <unk> . Due to differences in kashrut standards held by different organizations , the <unk> of certain Jewish authorities may at times be considered invalid by other Jewish authorities . The certification marks of the various rabbis and organisations are too numerous to list , but one of the most commonly used in the United States of America is that of the Union of Orthodox Congregations , who use a U inside a circle ( " O @-@ U " ) , symbolising the initials of Orthodox Union . In Britain , a commonly used symbol is the " <unk> " logo of the London Beth Din . A single K is sometimes used as a symbol for kosher , but since many countries do not allow letters to be trademarked ( the method by which other symbols are protected from misuse ) , it only indicates that the company producing the product claims that it is kosher . 
 Many of the certification symbols are accompanied by additional letters or words to indicate the category of the product , according to Jewish law ; the categorisation may conflict with legal classifications , especially in the case of food that Jewish law regards as dairy , but legal classification does not . 
 D — Dairy 
 DE — Dairy equipment 
 M — Meat , including poultry 
 Pareve — Food that is neither meat nor dairy 
 Fish 
 P — Passover @-@ related ( P is not used for Pareve ) 
 In many cases constant supervision is required because , for various reasons , such as changes in manufacturing processes , products that once were kosher may cease to be so . For example , a kosher lubricating oil may be replaced by one containing tallow , which many rabbinic authorities view as non @-@ kosher . Such changes are often co @-@ ordinated with the supervising rabbi , or supervising organisation , to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any hechsher or kashrut . In some cases , however , existing stocks of pre @-@ printed labels with the hechsher may continue to be used on the now non @-@ kosher product . An active grapevine among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable , as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the hechsher . Some newspapers and periodicals also discuss kashrut products . 
 Products labeled kosher @-@ style are non @-@ kosher products that have characteristics of kosher foods , such as all @-@ beef hot dogs , or are flavored or prepared in a manner consistent with Ashkenazi practices , like dill pickles . The designation usually refers to delicatessen items . 
 = = = History of kosher supervision and marketing = = = 
 In 1911 Procter & Gamble became the first company to advertise one of their products , <unk> , as kosher . Over the next two decades , companies such as Lender 's <unk> , Maxwell House , <unk> , and Empire evolved and gave the kosher market more shelf @-@ space . In the 1960s , Hebrew National <unk> launched a " we answer to a higher authority " campaign to appeal to Jews and non @-@ Jews alike . From that point on , " kosher " became a symbol for both quality and value . The kosher market quickly expanded , and with it more opportunities for kosher products . Menachem <unk> , founder of the <unk> trade fair , estimates as many as 14 million kosher consumers and $ 40 billion in sales of kosher products in the USA . 
 In 2014 the Israeli Defense Forces decided to allow female kosher supervisors to work in its kitchens on military bases , and the first women kosher inspectors were certified in Israel . 
 = = = Legal usage = = = 
 Advertising standards laws in many jurisdictions prohibit the use of the phrase kosher in a product 's labelling unless the producer can show that the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws ; however , different jurisdictions often define the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws differently . For example , in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the kashrut nature , in others the rules of kosher are fully defined in law , and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations . In several cases , laws restricting the use of the term kosher have later been determined to be illegal religious interference . 
 = = = Costs = = = 
 In the United States the cost of certification for mass @-@ produced items is typically minuscule , and is usually more than offset by the advantages of being certified . In 1975 The New York Times estimated the cost per item for obtaining kosher certification at 6 @.@ 5 millionths of a cent ( $ 0 @.@ <unk> ) per item for a General Foods frozen @-@ food item . According to a 2005 report by Burns & McDonnell , most US national certifying agencies are non @-@ profit , only charging for supervision and on @-@ site work , for which the on @-@ site supervisor " typically makes less per visit than an auto mechanic does per hour " . However , re @-@ engineering an existing manufacturing process can be costly . Certification usually leads to increased revenues by opening up additional markets to Jews who keep kosher , Muslims who keep halal , Seventh @-@ day Adventists who keep the main laws of Kosher Diet , vegetarians , and the lactose @-@ intolerant who wish to avoid dairy products ( products that are reliably certified as pareve meet this criterion ) . According to the Orthodox Union , one of the largest kashrut organizations in the United States , " when positioned next to a competing non @-@ kosher brand , a kosher product will do better by 20 % " . 
 In some European communities there is a special tax imposed on the purchase of kosher meat to help support the community 's educational institutions . In 2009 delegates at a meeting of the Rabbinical Council of Europe broadly agreed that the tax which supports the rabbinate , <unk> ’ os and other communal facilities should be reduced . " While the supermarket Tesco sells a whole chicken for £ 2 , its kosher counterpart of similar weight costs five to six times more . "

 = = = Adherence = = = 
 A 2013 survey found that 22 % of American Jews surveyed say they kept kosher in the home . Many Jews observe kashrut partially , by abstaining from pork or shellfish , or not drinking milk with a meat dish . Some keep kosher at home but will eat in a non @-@ kosher restaurant . In 2012 , one analysis of the specialty food market in North America estimated that only 15 % of Kosher consumers were Jewish . A sizable non @-@ Jewish segment of the population views kosher certification as an indication of wholesomeness . Muslims , Hindus , and people with allergies to dairy foods often consider the kosher @-@ pareve designation as an assurance that a food contains no animal @-@ derived ingredients , including milk and all of its derivatives . However , since kosher @-@ pareve foods may contain honey , eggs , or fish , strict vegetarians cannot rely on the certification . 
 = = = Linguistics = = = 
 Kosher ( Hebrew : <unk> ) in Ancient Hebrew means be advantageous , proper , suitable , or succeed according to the Brown @-@ Driver @-@ Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon . In Modern Hebrew , it generally refers to kashrut but can also sometimes mean " proper " . For example , the Babylonian Talmud uses kosher in the sense of virtuous , when referring to Darius I as a " kosher king " ; Darius , a Persian King , assisted in building the Second Temple . In English , kosher often means legitimate , acceptable , permissible , genuine , or authentic . 
 The word kosher is also part of some common product names . Sometimes it is used as an abbreviation of <unk> , meaning the process for making something kosher ; for example , kosher salt is a form of salt with irregularly shaped crystals , making it particularly suitable for preparing meat according to the rules of kashrut , because the increased surface area of the crystals absorbs blood more <unk> other times it is used as a synonym for Jewish tradition ; for example , a kosher dill pickle is simply a pickle made in the traditional manner of Jewish New York City pickle makers , using a generous addition of garlic to the brine , and is not necessarily compliant with the traditional Jewish food laws . 
 = Charlotte Stuart , Duchess of Albany = 
 Charlotte Stuart , styled Duchess of Albany ( 29 October 1753 – 17 November 1789 ) was the illegitimate daughter of the Jacobite pretender Prince Charles Edward Stuart ( ' Bonnie Prince Charlie ' or the ' Young Pretender ' ) and his only child to survive infancy . 
 Her mother was Clementina Walkinshaw , who was mistress to the Prince from 1752 until 1760 . After years of abuse , Clementina left him , taking Charlotte with her . Charlotte spent most of her life in French convents , estranged from a father who refused to make any provision for her . Unable to marry , she herself became a mistress with illegitimate children , taking Ferdinand de Rohan , Archbishop of Bordeaux , as her lover . 
 She was finally reconciled with her father in 1784 , when he legitimised her and created her Duchess of Albany in the Jacobite Peerage . She left her own children with her mother , and became her father 's carer and companion in the last years of his life , before dying less than two years after him . Her three children were raised in anonymity ; however , as the only grandchildren of the pretender , they have been the subject of Jacobite interest since their lineage was uncovered in the 20th century . 
 = = Royal parentage = = 
 Charlotte Stuart was born on 29 October 1753 at Liège to Charles and his mistress Clementina Walkinshaw , whom he had met during the Jacobite rising of 1745 ( when he came to Scotland from France in an attempt to regain by force the thrones of England , Scotland and Ireland , which had been lost by his grandfather , James II and VII , in 1689 ) . Clementina ( 1720 – 1802 ) was the youngest of the ten daughters of John Walkinshaw of <unk> ( 1671 – 1731 ) . The <unk> owned the lands of <unk> and <unk> , and her father had become a wealthy Glasgow merchant ( founding the textile village of Calton ) . However , he was also an Episcopalian and a Jacobite who had fought for the Prince 's father in the rising of 1715 , been captured at the Battle of Sheriffmuir , before escaping from Stirling Castle and fleeing to Europe . In 1717 , he had been pardoned by the British Government and returned to Glasgow , where his youngest daughter was born probably at <unk> . However , Clementina was largely educated on the Continent , and later converted to Roman Catholicism . In 1746 , she was living at the home of her uncle Sir Hugh Paterson at Bannockburn , near Stirling . The Prince came to Sir Hugh 's home in early January 1746 where he first met Clementina , and he returned later that month to be nursed by her from what appears to have been a cold . Given that she was living under her uncle 's protection , it is not thought the two were lovers at this time . 
 After the defeat of the Prince 's rebellion at Culloden in April 1746 , Charles fled Scotland for France . In the following years , he had a scandalous affair with his 22 @-@ year @-@ old first cousin Louise de <unk> ( who was married to his close friend , and whom he deserted when she became pregnant ) and then with the Princess of <unk> , who was in her 40s . In 1752 , he heard that Clementina was at Dunkirk and in some financial difficulties , so he sent 50 louis d 'or to help her and then dispatched Sir Henry Goring to entreat her to come to Ghent and live with him as his mistress . Goring , who described Clementina as a " bad woman " , complained of being used as " no better than a pimp " , and shortly after left Charles 's employ . However , by November 1752 , Clementina was living with Charles , and was to remain as his mistress for the following eight years . The couple moved to Liège where Charlotte , their only child , was born on 29 October 1753 and baptised into the Roman Catholic faith at the church of Sainte Marie @-@ des @-@ Fonts . 
 = = Separation from father ( 1760 – 1783 ) = = 
 The relationship between prince and mistress was disastrous . Charles was already a disillusioned , angry alcoholic when they began living together , and he became violent towards , and insanely possessive of , Clementina , treating her as a " submissive whipping post " . Often away from home on " jaunts " , he seldom referred to his daughter , and when he did , it was as " ye <unk> " . During a temporary move to Paris , the Prince 's lieutenants record ugly public arguments between the two , and that his drunkenness and temper were damaging his reputation . By 1760 , they were in Basel , and Clementina had had enough of Charles 's intoxication and their nomadic lifestyle . She contacted his staunchly Roman Catholic father , James Stuart ( ' the Old Pretender ' ) , and expressed a desire to secure a Catholic education for Charlotte and to retire to a convent . ( In 1750 , during an incognito visit to London , Charles had nominally disavowed Roman Catholicism for the Anglican Church . ) James agreed to pay her an annuity of 10 @,@ 000 livres and , in July 1760 , there is evidence to suggest he aided her escape from the watchful Charles , with the seven @-@ year @-@ old Charlotte , to the convent of the Nuns of the Visitation in Paris . She left a letter for Charles expressing her devotion to him but complaining she had had to flee in fear of her life . A furious Charles circulated descriptions of them both , but it was to no avail . 
 = = = Appeals from France = = = 
 For the next twelve years , Clementina and Charlotte continued to live in various French convents , supported by the 10 @,@ 000 livre pension granted by James Stuart . Charles never forgave Clementina for depriving him of " ye <unk> " , and stubbornly refused to pay anything for their support . On 1 January 1766 James died , but Charles , ( now considering himself de jure Charles III of Scotland , England and Ireland ) still refused to make any provision for the two , forcing Clementina , now styling herself " Countess <unk> " , to appeal to his brother Cardinal Henry Stuart for assistance . Henry gave them an allowance of 5 @,@ 000 livres , but in return extracted a statement from Clementina that she had never been married to Charles – a statement she later tried to retract . This lower amount forced them to find cheaper lodgings in the convent of Notre Dame at Meaux @-@ en @-@ Brie . 
 In 1772 , the Prince , then aged fifty @-@ one , married the nineteen @-@ year @-@ old Princess Louise of Stolberg @-@ <unk> ( who was only a year older than Charlotte ) . Charlotte , now in penury , had consistently been writing to her father for some time , and she now desperately entreated him to legitimise her , provide support , and bring her to Rome before an heir could be born . In April 1772 , Charlotte wrote a touching , yet pleading , letter to " mon Augusta Papa " which was sent via Principal Gordon of the Scots College in Rome . Charles relented and offered to bring Charlotte to Rome ( he was now resident in the Palazzo Muti – the residence of the Stuarts @-@ in @-@ exile ) , but only on condition she would leave her mother behind in France . This she loyally refused to do , and Charles , in fury , broke off all discussions . 
 = = = Mistress of an Archbishop = = = 
 Towards the end of 1772 , Clementina and Charlotte unexpectedly arrived in Rome to press their desperate cause in person . ( The trip pushed Clementina further into debt . ) However , the Prince reacted angrily , refusing even to see them , forcing their helpless return to France , from where Charlotte 's pleading letters continued . Three years later , Charlotte , now in her twenty @-@ second year and already in poor health , ( she was apparently suffering from a liver ailment shared by the Stuarts ) decided her only option was to marry as soon as possible . Charles , however , refused to give permission either for her to marry or to take the veil , and she was left awaiting his royal pleasure . 
 Lacking legitimacy or permission , Charlotte was unable to marry . Thus , she otherwise sought a protector and provider . Probably unbeknown to Charles , she became the mistress of Ferdinand Maximilien <unk> de Rohan , Archbishop of Bordeaux and Cambrai . Ferdinand de Rohan – related by blood to the house of Stuart as well as Bourbon and Lorraine – was also unable to marry legitimately , having entered the Church as a younger son of a noble house . By him , she had three children : two daughters , Marie Victoire and Charlotte , and finally a son , Charles Edward . Her children were kept secret , and remained largely unknown until the 20th century . When Charlotte eventually left France for Florence , she entrusted the children – and she was only just recovering from her son 's birth – to the care of her mother , and it appears that few , and certainly not her father , knew of their existence . 
 = = Reconciliation = = 
 Only after his childless marriage to Louise was over , and Charles had fallen seriously ill , did he take an interest in Charlotte . She was now thirty , and she had not seen her father since she was seven . On 23 March 1783 , he altered his will to make her his heir and , a week later , signed an act of legitimisation . This act , recognising her as his natural daughter and entitling her to succeed to his private estate , was sent to Louis XVI of France . Henry Stuart , however , contested the legitimisation as being irregular and confusing to the succession . Louis XVI eventually did confirm the act and register it with the Parlement of Paris , but not until 6 September 1787 . 
 In July 1784 , having granted Louise a legal separation , Charles summoned Charlotte to Florence , where he was now resident and , in November , installed her in the Palazzo Guadagni as Duchess of Albany , styling her " Her Royal Highness " – and appointing her to the Order of the Thistle . Nevertheless , being illegitimate at birth , Charlotte still had no right of succession to the Stuart claim to the British throne . However , by this stage , the claims were of little value . European rulers had long since ceased to take Charles seriously . Even Pope Pius VI was refusing to recognise his royal title , and the famous Casanova had wittily called him the " pretender @-@ in @-@ vain " . He was reduced to styling himself the ' Count d <unk> ' . 
 That a Stuart restoration was now less than unlikely did not prevent the Prince presenting Charlotte as the next generation of the cause . He had medals struck for her , bearing the figure of Hope , the map of England , and the Stuart arms with legends such as " <unk> <unk> Est Una " ( there is one hope ) . He also had her idealised in art ; the Scottish artist Gavin Hamilton was commissioned to draw her in chalk in the neo @-@ classical style , whilst Hugh Douglas Hamilton painted a flattering portrait in a tiara . 
 = = = Companion to her father = = = 
 When Charlotte arrived to live with her father in 1784 , he was an ailing alcoholic . She found his physical state disgusting , and he was suffering from mental degeneration and using a litter for travel . He did , however , introduce Charlotte into society , allowing her to wear his mother 's famous Sobieska jewellery . She continually , and unsuccessfully , sought gifts of jewels or money from her close @-@ fisted father ; but this was probably largely out of a concern for the welfare of her mother and children . Within a month of arriving at Florence , she did manage to persuade her father to provide at last for Clementina . By this time , Charlotte was also in poor health , suffering from an ailment that would result in her death from " obstruction of the liver " just two years after her father . Indeed , shortly after she arrived in Florence , a protruding growth forced her to have clothes altered . Charlotte sorely missed her mother ( whom she vainly hoped Charles would allow to come to Rome ) and her children , writing to her mother as many as 100 times in a single year ; she also feared that Rohan would take another lover ; all this is revealed in her dispirited letters home , as she awaited Charles 's death . 
 = = = Final months = = = 
 In December 1785 , she enlisted the help of Henry Stuart to get Charles back to the Palazzo Muti in Rome . There , Charlotte remained her father 's carer and companion and did her best to make his life bearable until he died of a stroke two years later ( 31 January 1788 ) . Her sacrifice for him was considerable — she was torn between an evident affection for her father and her mother and three children left behind in Paris . 
 Charlotte survived her father by only twenty @-@ two months and never saw her children again . On 9 October 1789 , she arrived at the Palazzo <unk> Sanguinetti ( now Palazzo <unk> ) in Bologna , the home of her friend the Marchesa Giulia <unk> @-@ <unk> . She died there at age 36 of liver cancer ( 17 November 1789 ) . In her will , written just three days before her death , Charlotte left her mother , Clementina , a sum of 50 @,@ 000 livres and an annuity of a further 15 @,@ 000 . However , it was two years before Henry Stuart , her executor , and now considered by Jacobites to be King Henry IX , would release the money . Indeed , he only agreed to do this when Clementina signed a " <unk> " renouncing , on behalf of herself and her descendants , any further claim on the estate . Charlotte was buried in the Church of San Biagio , near where she died . When the church was pulled down by the French in 1797 , Charlotte 's remains were moved to the Oratorio della Santissima Trinità . When it closed in 1961 , her monument ( and possibly her remains ) were moved to the nearby Chiesa della Santissima Trinità .

 For many years , Charlotte 's three children remained unknown to history , and it was believed that the direct line of James II and Mary of Modena ended with the death of Henry in 1807 . However , in the 1950s , research by the historians Alasdair and Hetty Tayler revealed the existence of two daughters and a son . Historian George Sherburn then discovered the letters from Charlotte to her mother , from which he wrote his biography of Charles Edward . 
 = = = Children = = = 
 It appears that Clementina lived on in Fribourg , Switzerland , until her death in 1802 and that it was she who reared Charlotte 's children in deliberate anonymity . Their identities were concealed by a variety of aliases and ruses , not even being mentioned in Charlotte 's detailed will . The will makes reference only to Clementina and to Charlotte 's desire that Clementina might be able to provide for " her <unk> relations " . The reason these children remained secret can be explained by the fact that the relationship between Rohan , the Archbishop , and Charlotte , who had been forbidden to marry , was highly illicit and would have been scandalous . Marie Victoire Adelaide ( born 1779 ) and Charlotte <unk> Amélie ( born 1780 ) were thought to have been placed in the care of Thomas Coutts , the London banker , and a distant relative of the <unk> . They remained in anonymity and were believed to have been simply absorbed into English society . 
 Charlotte 's son , Charles Edward , born in Paris in 1784 , followed a different path . Calling himself ' Count <unk> ' ( Rohan + Stuart ) , he was educated by his father 's family in Germany , became an officer in the Russian army , and a general in the Austrian service . He travelled widely — visiting India , America , and the West Indies — before coming to England and Scotland . He told such tall tales of his origins and adventures that few believed his claims to royal descent . Indeed , it was not until the 20th century that historian George Sherburn established that he was indeed who he had claimed to be . He died in Scotland in 1854 as the result of a coach accident near Stirling Castle and was buried at Dunkeld Cathedral , where his grave can still be seen . He married twice but had no issue . 
 Occasionally , it has been suggested that Prince Charles married Clementina Walkinshaw , and thus that Charlotte was legitimate and could legally claim to be her father 's successor . However , there are no records to substantiate this claim , and the affidavit signed by Clementina on 9 March 1767 explicitly disavows the idea . Further , Charles 's initial disavowal of Charlotte speaks against her legitimacy . 
 It was generally believed that Charlotte 's daughters also died without issue . However , according to Peter Pininski 's research , Charlotte 's elder daughter , Marie Victoire , did have issue . Pininski 's 2002 book suggested that Jules @-@ Hercule , Prince de <unk> and Duke of <unk> , elder brother of Ferdinand de Rohan ( and aide de camp to Henry Stuart in 1745 ) recognised Charlotte 's offspring as his own – thus giving her status in that tight family . The book claimed that in 1793 , at the outbreak of the French revolution , the Rohan family scattered ; and Marie Victoire de Rohan went to relatives in Poland . There , she met and married Paul Anthony Louis Bertrand de <unk> , a Polish nobleman and son of a banker . They had a son , <unk> , before she was widowed four years later . ( She later remarried twice : first to James d 'Auvergne , a British naval captain , who died after 14 months , and then finally to Jean de Pauw , a French army officer . ) <unk> was to have a son , Charles , and a daughter , Julia @-@ Thérèse , who married Count Leonard Pininski and became Peter Pininski 's great @-@ great @-@ grandmother . Pininski 's evidence for his thesis has been described as " often indirect , if not elliptical " ; the <unk> were a large family , and it is easy to confuse its many members . A former chairman of the Royal Stuart Society , however , stated that Pininski 's evidence seemed " genuine " , and genealogist Hugh Massingberd described it as " painstakingly researched ... proof to surely the most sceptical pedant 's satisfaction " . 
 Pininski 's hypothesis has since been disputed by Marie @-@ Louise Backhurst in a 2013 article . Backhurst contends that the Charlotte 's second daughter , who was always called Victoire Adelaide , was married firstly at St Roch , Paris , in 1804 to a military doctor in the service of Napoleon , Pierre Joseph Marie de St Ursin ( 1763 – 1818 ) . By de St Ursin she was the mother of Theodore Marie de St Ursin who was born in Paris about 1809 – 10 and who was still resident in Paris in 1823 , although his history has not been found . His mother married again in 1823 to one Corbet James D 'Auvergne , although her place and date of death have not been found . Backhurst examined Madame <unk> 's baptism , marriage and death , and gives her name as Marie Victoire de <unk> , and Backhurst suggests that she was more likely to have been the illegitimate daughter of Jules , Prince de Rohan , brother of Ferdinand and thus a first cousin to Victoire Adelaide . Pininski argues that Backhurst 's interpretation is based on a destroyed document that was " reconstituted " seventy years later and that no document confirms the birth of Marie Victoire 's son , whereas Pininski 's publications provide original archival documents and fully describe the context . 
 = = = In Jacobite folklore = = = 
 Charlotte Stuart 's story did not take long to enter into the Jacobite folklore . The Scots poet , Robert Burns ( 1759 – 96 ) , a near contemporary , wrote a number of works celebrating the tragic romanticism of the Jacobite cause . Amongst them was The Bonnie Lass of Albanie , a lament to Charlotte Stuart probably written at the time of her death . Indeed , evidence from an unpublished collection of letters from Burns to Robert Ainslie reveals the Poet 's fascination with Charlotte , in that he considered naming one of his own illegitimate children Charlotte after her .

 = Australian Crawl = 
 Australian Crawl ( often called Aussie Crawl or The Crawl by fans ) were an Australian rock band founded by James Reyne ( lead vocals / piano ) , Brad Robinson ( rhythm guitar ) , Paul Williams ( bass ) , Simon Binks ( lead guitar ) and David Reyne ( drums ) in 1978 . David Reyne soon left and was replaced by Bill McDonough ( drums , percussion ) . They were later joined by his brother Guy McDonough ( vocals , rhythm guitar ) . The band was named after the front crawl swimming style also known as the Australian crawl . 
 Australian Crawl were associated with surf music and sponsored a surfing competition in 1984 . However , they also handled broader social issues such as shallow materialism , alcoholism , car accidents , and cautionary tales of romance . 
 After their 1980 debut album , The Boys Light Up reached No. 4 , Australian Crawl had two No. 1 albums ; 1981 's Sirocco and 1982 's Sons of Beaches . Their early singles reached the top 25 but none broke into the Top Ten ; their best performing single was No. 1 hit " Reckless " which showed a more mature approach than earlier hits , and came from their 1983 Semantics EP . 
 Upheaval within the band occurred from 1983 onwards . First Bill McDonough left , then his brother Guy McDonough died in 1984 , then various other members left . Their 1985 release Between a Rock and a Hard Place was expensive but sales were disappointing ; and they disbanded early in 1986 . The band 's status as an icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged by induction into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) Hall of Fame . Founding guitarist Brad Robinson was unable to attend the Hall of Fame induction in person , as he was hospitalised with lymphoma and died two weeks later .

 = = = 1975 – 1979 = = = 
 The band Spiff <unk> formed in 1976 in the Mornington Peninsula suburb of Mount Eliza on the outskirts of Melbourne . The group lineup featured James Reyne , brothers Bill and Guy McDonough , Paul Williams , Robert Walker and Simon Binks . Reyne had previously played drums for Archie <unk> and the Doors . 
 By early 1978 Spiff <unk> had separated into two groups : The Flatheads ( including the McDonough brothers and Walker , along with Sean Higgins and Nigel Spencer ) and Australian Crawl . The original lineup for the latter was Reyne as vocalist , Binks on lead guitar , Williams on bass guitar , along with Reyne 's younger brother David Reyne on drums and schoolmate Brad Robinson on rhythm guitar . Australian Crawl performed their first live gig in October 1978 and toured the pub circuit . 
 David Reyne left the group in 1979 to finish his acting course , later becoming an actor and TV presenter as well as drumming for Cats Under Pressure and the <unk> ( 1986 – 1990 ) . He was replaced in Australian Crawl by Bill McDonough . The group 's popularity in the Mornington Peninsula area increased with further pub gigs , then they gained audiences with university students and inner city residents . 
 Once the band ’ s escalating popularity brought them into Melbourne they caught the attention of Little River Band ’ s guitarist David Briggs , who helped them gain a recording contract with EMI and he produced their first single . " Beautiful People " ( 1979 ) reached No. 22 on the National charts . Reyne had co @-@ written the song with guitarist Mark Hudson in 1975 . The track included references to the shallow materialism of residents of Toorak and to the Bombay Rock night club in Brunswick . 
 Just days before recording " Beautiful People " Reyne had been hit by a car in Swanston Street , Melbourne , breaking bones in both wrists , an episode later chronicled in the track " Indisposed " . Australian Crawl made one of the most memorable debuts on Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) TV series Countdown performing " Beautiful People " as Reyne still had both arms encased in plaster . " Beautiful People " remains one of their most popular songs according to listeners of Triple M in 2007 . 
 = = = 1980 = = = 
 Australian Crawl 's debut album The Boys Light Up ( 1980 ) , also produced by Briggs for EMI , had a number of hit singles with songwriting shared around the group and beyond . Tracks from this album included the previously released single " Beautiful People " , the title track ( written by Reyne and Mark Hudson ) ; " Indisposed " ( Brad Robinson , James Robinson , Reyne , Bill McDonough ) and " Downhearted " ( Sean Higgins , Guy McDonough , Bill McDonough ) ( from The Flatheads ) . Brad Robinson 's father James Robinson was a Federal Arbitration Court Justice . 
 " The Boys Light Up " , their second single , was almost banned from radio play due to its explicit lyrics . Many listeners believed the chorus lyrics were about smoking marijuana but Reyne has stated that it was about smoking tobacco cigarettes at school . It also reached No. 22 on the National charts and became their signature song and their most popular track especially live . Their third single " Downhearted " charted higher at # 12 and was a cautionary tale of romance gone wrong . 
 The Boys Light Up reached No. 4 on the Australian album charts and remained in the charts for an unbroken 101 weeks . It sold five times platinum : over 280 @,@ 000 copies , and became one of the biggest Australian albums of the 1980s . Singer / guitarist / songwriter Guy McDonough ( ex @-@ The Flatheads and Bill 's younger brother ) joined the group in October 1980 . 
 Rock journalist and commentator , Glenn A. Baker compared Australian Crawl with various fellow Australian bands : 
 Australian Crawl seemed to step out of a tourism poster ... Spruce , lean , tanned and young ... They swam , they surfed , they radiated a healthy , wholly Australian aura ... If Skyhooks has personified the <unk> <unk> and Cold Chisel the hard drinking working class man , Australian Crawl turned the bronzed lifesaver into a pop idol ... Crawl songs seemed to eulogise hedonism , adventure and the great outdoors for an audience that couldn 't be bothered with Midnight Oil 's politics . 
 However , according to James Reyne some people accused them of being demonic . He said whenever you bumped into the member of Little River Band who had found God , he 'd tell him " you shouldn 't be playing that , it 's demonic " . 
 = = = 1981 – 1982 = = = 
 In 1981 , Australian Crawl recorded their second album , Sirocco with producer Peter Dawkins in Sydney . Named for Errol Flynn 's yacht , the album peaked at No. 1 on the Australian album chart on 3 August and remained there for six weeks . At about this time Robinson was married to actress Kerry Armstrong , later an Australian Film Institute Award winner , who co @-@ wrote a track " Easy On Your Own " for the album . 
 Sirocco spawned the hit singles " Things Don 't Seem " ( May , No. 11 National charts ) and " Errol " ( August , # 18 ) . It also included " Oh No Not You Again " ( November ) . Of these , " Errol " about womanising Tasmanian @-@ born actor Flynn is the band 's third most popular song of all . Another track from the album , " Lakeside " , became a popular radio inclusion . 1981 Australian End of Year Album Charts has Sirocco at No. 2 behind Double Fantasy by John Lennon and ahead of AC / DC 's Back in Black making it the best charting album by an Australian act . 
 Another track on this album , Unpublished Critics has been compared several times to the later song " Sweet Child o ' Mine " by US band Guns N ' Roses as acknowledged , by its writer , James Reyne . He was responding to media comments in May 2015 about the possibility of plagiarism by the American band . 
 On the wave of this popularity the band toured extensively playing to huge crowds at Melbourne 's Myer Music Bowl ( 100 @,@ 000 ) , Sydney 's Domain ( 90 @,@ 000 ) , the <unk> Rock festival ( 70 @,@ 000 ) , smashing attendance records at indoor venues in Brisbane and Perth . They were voted Countdown 1981 Most Popular Group , and James Reyne was voted 1980 and 1981 Most Popular Male Performer . 
 Sons of Beaches ( 1982 ) was recorded in Hawaii with expatriate Australian Mike Chapman producing . The album had a rougher , rock ' n ' roll edge than its glossy pop rock predecessors and featured the No. 17 hit " Shut Down " ( June ) . It also included a re @-@ recorded version of " Downhearted " and became their second album to reach No. 1 on the Australian albums chart and remained there for five weeks . EMI issued the album in the USA . Two further singles , " Daughters of the Northern Coast " ( August ) and " Runaway Girls " ( November ) failed to reach the Australian Top 40 . 
 Over 1982 – 1983 Reyne was filmed with Australian actresses Rebecca Gilling and Wendy Hughes in the television miniseries Return to Eden , which was screened in September 1983 . For Reyne 's role of playboy tennis professional Greg Marsden , he was given the 1984 " Most Popular New Talent Award " at the TV Week Logie Awards . Reyne later declared he was not very good in the part , declining many acting offers since . During breaks in filming , the singer accepted an offer from Paul Christie ( Mondo Rock ) and Kevin Borich to join their part @-@ time band The Party Boys with Harvey James from Sherbet and Graham Bidstrup from The Angels . The group played a short run of shows around Sydney venues and played covers exclusively . The resultant album , Live at Several <unk> , peaked at No. 9 on the national chart . 
 = = = 1983 – 1984 = = = 
 Soon after Reyne finished acting for Return to Eden , Bill McDonough left due to tensions within the band . The remaining members then recorded the EP Semantics ( 1983 ) with Bidstrup ( from The Party Boys , later a founder of <unk> ) on drums . The four track EP contained their best @-@ known song , " Reckless " ( aka " Don 't Be So Reckless " , " She Don 't Like That " ) which was written by Reyne , and went to No. 1 on the Australian singles chart on 28 November . John Watson ( Kevin Borich Express ) then came in as a permanent replacement for McDonough . The live album Phalanx was something of a stop @-@ gap measure between studio albums , nevertheless it reached No. 4 during December . The band 's biggest overseas break came when Duran Duran took the band as support on certain legs of their " Sing Blue Silver " tour of the UK . 
 US label Geffen Records signed Australian Crawl and issued Semantics ( 1984 ) as an album ( with the four songs from the EP and re @-@ recordings of tracks from past Australian records ) for the American market . In April 1984 Australian Crawl became the first Australian band to sponsor an ASP surfing competition . The Rip Curl / Australian Crawl Bell 's Beach Surfing Festival was won by Australian surfer , Cheyne Horan . 
 In June 1984 the band was forced off the road when Guy McDonough was admitted to hospital in Melbourne ; he died soon after of viral pneumonia . Australian Crawl regrouped with Mark Greig on guitar ( ex @-@ Runners ) for a series of live performances in late 1984 . Prior to Guy 's death , he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough ( drums , percussion ) , Sean Higgins ( synthesisers ) and Nigel Spencer ( bass , synthesisers ) , ( all former The Flatheads ) ; and Mick Hauser ( saxophone ) and Michael Bright ( guitar ) . Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough 's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985 . Singles " My Place " / " Things Don 't Seem " and " What 's in it For Me " / " Hook , Line and Sinker " were also released . " Things Don 't Seem " written by Guy McDonough and Sean Higgins , had been released as an Australian Crawl single in 1981 off Sirocco . Tracks from these sessions were re @-@ mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996 . 
 = = = 1985 – 1986 = = = 
 By 1985 the group recorded their last studio album , Between a Rock and a Hard Place , with English producer Adam Kidron . It was released in Australia on Australian Crawl 's own label Freestyle Records . The album , which allegedly cost $ 400 @,@ 000 to record , was a mishmash of styles and a commercial disaster ( it peaked at No. 12 in August 1985 but slipped out of the Top 40 two weeks later ) . None of the singles had any Top 40 chart success . Harry Brus ( Kevin Borich Express ) replaced long @-@ standing bass player Paul Williams in May 1985 . The band performed three songs for the July 1985 Oz for Africa concert — part of the global Live Aid program — " Reckless ( Don 't Be So ) " , " Two Can Play " and " The Boys Light Up " . It was broadcast in Australia ( on both Seven Network and Nine Network ) and on MTV in the US . 
 When the album virtually failed to chart , the band was ready to split but had to go out on tour to pay off its debts . On 27 January 1986 , their final Melbourne concert was recorded and released as the live album The Final Wave in October . The band performed its final concert on 1 February at the Perth Entertainment Centre . 
 We really enjoy Perth , and have a lot of friends there , so it was a conscious decision to play our final show there . Besides , everybody expected us to play the last show back in Melbourne , so stuff ' em . 
 In seven years , Australian Crawl had sold over a million records in Australia , with five of its albums and an EP reaching the Australian Top 5 Album Charts , two of which had been No. 1 hits . A cumulative total of eleven weeks at Number 1 on the Albums Charts places them equal fourth for Australian groups behind Skyhooks , The Seekers and Midnight Oil . 
 = = = Post 1986 = = = 
 In 1985 , Lin <unk> ( Electric Pandas ) and Reyne released a duet single " <unk> " / " Under My Thumb " . After Australian Crawl disbanded , Reyne went on to a solo career . His first few singles failed to chart but 1987 's " Fall of Rome " and the self @-@ titled album that followed were the beginning of a string of hits that lasted until the early 1990s . In 1992 he and James Blundell had a hit with a cover of The Dingoes ' " Way Out West " ( # 2 , May 1992 ) . Reyne also formed Company of Strangers that year with former Sherbet lead singer Daryl Braithwaite , Simon Hussey and Jef Scott . Company of Strangers only released one self @-@ titled album , Company of Strangers in 1992 , which produced the hits " Motor City ( I Get Lost ) " ( # 26 , September 1992 ) , " Sweet Love " ( # 21 , January 1993 ) and " Daddy 's Gonna Make You a Star " ( # 35 , March 1993 ) . 
 In 1993 Reyne appeared as Tina Turner 's manager Roger Davies in What 's Love Got to do With It ? . He featured in twelve episodes of State Coroner during 1998 and in 2003 's The Postcard Bandit . Reyne lives on the Mornington Peninsula with his partner , Tina , and a daughter . He has released his eighth solo studio album , Every Man a King ( 2007 ) and still performs occasionally . 
 Almost immediately after the split Robinson became manager of <unk> ( with early Crawl drummer David Reyne ) . Their first single , " The Witch Queen of New Orleans " ( 1986 ) , a cover of Redbone 's song , reached No. 4 on the National charts . Robinson then moved into a career in television ( with Network Ten 's Page One ) and as a co @-@ producer of documentaries . In the 1990s he became the manager for the Reyne brothers and worked as an agent for the Advantage Sports Management Group . This included managing Australian tennis player Mark <unk> . Three years after being diagnosed with lymphoma , Robinson died on 13 October 1996 . The band was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1996 , weeks before Robinson 's death . 
 Binks played in the Broderick Smith Band in 1988 . He was injured in a 1995 car crash at a council roadworks that left him slightly brain @-@ damaged . A court in 2006 awarded him $ 330 @,@ 253 in damages , down from an estimated $ 750 @,@ 000 because he was said to be over the legal limit . Binks later disputed the alcohol reading as belonging to another driver and stated the remuneration mostly went to his lawyers . A 2007 appeal by the council , saw amount awarded further reduced to $ 304 @,@ 750 . 
 Australian Crawl compilation Lost & Found was released in 1996 and contained seven of the tracks from Guy McDonough 's solo album My Place which were remastered . <unk> and producers of Lost & Found were Bill McDonough and Peter Blyton . Lost & Found tracks from My Place include " Too Many People " a duet sung by Guy McDonough with Colin Hay of Men at Work . Some My Place tracks used on Lost & Found have Reyne singing backing vocals . As of 2007 , Bill McDonough was working in the construction industry . 
 Williams who had left the band in 1985 , was working in music @-@ related retail . 
 In 2001 the Australian Performing Right Association ( APRA ) , as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations , compiled a list of the Top 30 Australian songs , with " Reckless ( Don 't Be So ) " coming in at number nineteen . 
 On 14 October 2002 , EMI released a two @-@ CD Greatest Hits package called The Definitive Collection , which contained songs from the band and from James Reyne 's solo career . 
 In October 2007 , eleven Australian Crawl tracks were featured in the Triple M Essential 2007 Countdown of songs ( positions are voted by listeners out of the best 2007 songs of all time ) .

 = Reinhold von Werner = 
 Reinhold von Werner ( 10 May 1825 – 26 February 1909 ) was a Prussian and later Imperial German naval officer in the 19th century , eventually reaching the rank of vice admiral . He commanded warships during the three wars of German Unification , the Second Schleswig War , the Austro @-@ Prussian War , and the Franco @-@ Prussian War in 1864 , 1866 , and 1870 – 1871 , respectively , and during a naval intervention during a revolution in Spain in 1873 . His actions off Spain , considered extreme by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck , resulted in his court @-@ martial . He was promoted two years after the intervention in Spain , but was forced into retirement after a major feud with Albrecht von Stosch three years later . Werner wrote numerous books during and after his naval career , and also founded a periodical on maritime topics . He was ennobled in 1901 and died in February 1909 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Reinhold Werner was born on 10 May 1825 , in the town of <unk> , Prussia in what is now Saxony @-@ Anhalt . He served for several years in the merchant marine in the 1830s and 1840s , during which he made several voyages to the East Indies . While in the merchant marine , he was given the nickname Schweizer ( Swiss ) , as his North German shipmates found his accent to be particularly foreign compared to their native <unk> . 
 = = Naval career = = 
 In 1849 , Werner became an officer in the German <unk> ( Imperial Fleet ) , which had been organized the year before . In 1852 , he transferred to the Preussische Marine ( Prussian Navy ) , at the age of 22 . The Preussische Marine accepted only ten applicants to the officer corps that year . Werner was the only officer in the first group who was directly commissioned as a lieutenant ; the other nine became officer cadets . He was promoted to the rank of <unk> ( captain lieutenant ) in 1856 . While commanding the warship Elbe , he participated in a naval expedition to the Far East in 1859 – 1862 . 
 = = = Wars of German Unification = = = 
 During the Second Schleswig War of 1864 , Werner commanded a corvette against Danish naval forces . Werner fought with distinction at the Battle of <unk> , under the command of Eduard von Jachmann ; Werner 's ship , Nymphe , was badly damaged during the engagement and her crew suffered 13 casualties . The Danes successfully blocked the Prussian attempt to break through the Danish blockade , however , and forced them to return to Swinemünde . Werner and the rest of the fleet stationed there remained in port for the rest of the war . 
 At the outbreak of the Austro @-@ Prussian War , in the summer of 1866 , Werner was given command of a small squadron in the North Sea consisting of the ironclad warship SMS Arminius and a flotilla of small steam gunboats . Werner used the force to launch several troop landings against the Kingdom of Hanover , an ally of Austria . Werner led most of the landings himself ; his activities forced the surrender of several Hanoverian coastal batteries and several cities , including Emden and Stade . On 15 June , Werner and his squadron assisted 13 @,@ 500 men commanded by General Edwin von Manteuffel in their crossing of the Elbe River and assault of the city of Hanover . 
 After the Austro @-@ Prussian War , Werner was given command of the dock facilities in Danzig , a position he held until 1873 . In 1870 , the Franco @-@ Prussian War broke out , during which Werner was given command of the new ironclad Kronprinz . The two other broadside ironclads , Friedrich Carl and SMS König Wilhelm , suffered from chronic engine problems which prevented Admiral Jachmann from using the force offensively . Nevertheless , Werner sortied from Wilhelmshaven several times to trade shots with the blockading French fleet . Directly after the war with France , Werner pledged his support to General Albrecht von Stosch , who had been proposed as the new commander of the German fleet . In the fall of 1872 , Werner commanded a training cruise to South America ; his squadron consisted of Friedrich Carl , Elisabeth , Albatross , and Vineta . While on the cruise , Werner received orders to return most of the squadron to Europe to participate in an international intervention in Spain . Only Albatross remained in the Americas .

 In early 1873 , the First Spanish Republic was beset with the Cantonal Revolution . Werner commanded the ironclad Friedrich Carl ( his flagship ) and a pair of unarmored vessels on a naval intervention mission . The ships joined a British squadron that had been patrolling the southern Spanish coast . Admiral Werner , the senior commander in the group , was given command of the Anglo @-@ German force . A rebel faction of the Spanish Navy had seized four of the country 's seven ironclads . Werner 's squadron blockaded two rebel ironclads in the port of Cartagena after they had bombarded a coastal town . While steaming off Alicante , Friedrich Carl encountered the rebel armed steamer Vigilante , seized the vessel , and returned it to the Spanish national government . 
 Werner ordered Friedrich Carl and the British ironclad HMS Swiftsure to attack two of the rebel ships — Vitoria and Almansa — without authorization from London or Berlin . The rebel vessels had attempted to extort the port of Almería . In the brief engagement , the Anglo @-@ German force overwhelmed the rebels and seized both ships , which were subsequently turned over to the Spanish government . A captured rebel leader was briefly held on board Friedrich Carl . The rebels considered declaring war on Germany over the affair , but eventually decided against it . Admiral Werner 's blockade eventually forced the rebels to surrender , after which Friedrich Carl returned to Germany . Upon being informed of Werner 's actions , Chancellor Otto von Bismarck relieved him of command . Bismarck ordered a court @-@ martial for Werner on the charge of exceeding his orders . Bismarck also prohibited the Imperial Navy from conducting " gunboat diplomacy " in the future . Werner 's career as a sea @-@ going captain was effectively ended despite support from Kaiser Wilhelm I and his grandson , Wilhelm II ; he held only shore commands for the remainder of his career . He commanded the imperial dockyard in Wilhelmshaven for a year before being transferred to Kiel as the commander of the Baltic station . Werner partly blamed Stosch , who had agreed with Bismarck in his assessment of Werner 's activities , for his disgrace . This marked the beginning of a long and public feud between the two officers .

 In 1875 , Werner was promoted to <unk> ( rear admiral ) . In the aftermath of the accidental collision between SMS König Wilhelm and SMS Grosser Kurfürst , which resulted in the loss of the latter , Werner and Stosch argued , a disagreement that ultimately resulted in Werner 's forced retirement . Werner , then the chief of the Baltic station , presided over a commission that investigated the handling of the incident by Konteradmiral Batsch , a protégé of Stosch . The investigation heavily criticized Batsch as well as Stosch 's policies . Many naval officers — including Batsch — felt Stosch 's policies were more appropriate for the army than the navy . Alfred von Tirpitz , later the architect of the German High Seas Fleet , characterized Stosch 's policies as more befitting an infantry regiment than an armored warship , which was a " complicated microcosm of technology . " Stosch fought back against his critics , and targeted Werner in particular , who Stosch felt was primarily responsible for allowing the investigation to become a forum for officers opposed to Stosch . In addition to revenge for the handling of the investigation , Stosch sought to force Werner from the navy to remove one of only two officers senior in rank to Batsch , his protégé . Despite his popularity , particularly with Kaiser Wilhelm I and his son , Werner was unable to resist Stosch 's efforts to force his ouster . On 15 October 1878 , he requested retirement . In 1898 , the navy nominated him to be promoted to <unk> ( vice admiral ) .

 After leaving the navy , Werner became an author and ardent supporter of German naval expansion . He continued his feud with Stosch , going so far as to ally himself with Otto von Bismarck , who had sought Werner 's imprisonment five years earlier for his conduct off Spain . He also joined the rightist Free Union for Naval Lectures , founded on 16 November 1899 ; the union conducted a series of public lectures on the importance of the navy throughout Germany . Werner had begun writing in the 1860s , while still in the navy . He wrote a series of books , including accounts of the German expedition to the Far East from 1859 to 1862 and the development and expansion of the German fleet . In 1864 , he founded the periodical Hansa in Hamburg , which was concerned with topics relating to seamanship and coast guard activities . He was elevated to the nobility in 1901 and granted the right to use " von " in his name , and died on 26 February 1909 .

 Batwoman is a superheroine appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics . In all incarnations , the character is a wealthy heiress who becomes inspired by the superhero Batman and chooses , like him , to put her wealth and resources towards a war on crime as a masked vigilante in her home of Gotham City . The identity of Batwoman is shared by two heroines in mainstream DC publications ; both women are named Katherine Kane , with the original Batwoman commonly referred to by her nickname Kathy and the modern incarnation going by the name Kate . 
 Batwoman was created by Bob Kane and Sheldon Moldoff with writer Edmond Hamilton under the direction of editor Jack Schiff , as part of an ongoing effort to expand Batman 's cast of supporting characters . Batwoman began appearing in DC Comics stories beginning with Detective Comics # 233 ( 1956 ) , in which she was introduced as a love interest for Batman in order to combat the allegations of Batman 's homosexuality arising from the controversial book Seduction of the Innocent ( 1954 ) . When Julius Schwartz became editor of the Batman @-@ related comic books in 1964 , he removed non @-@ essential characters including Batwoman , Bat @-@ Girl , Bat @-@ Mite , and Bat @-@ Hound . Later , the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths retroactively established that Batwoman had never existed , though her alter ego Kathy Kane continued to be referred to occasionally . 
 After a long hiatus , Batwoman was reintroduced to DC continuity in 2006 in the seventh week of the publisher 's year @-@ long 52 weekly comic book . <unk> as Kate Kane , the modern Batwoman began operating in Gotham City in Batman 's absence following the events of the company @-@ wide crossover Infinite Crisis ( 2005 ) . The modern Batwoman is written as being of Jewish descent and as a lesbian in an effort by DC editorial staff to diversify its publications and better connect to modern @-@ day readership . Described as the highest @-@ profile gay superhero to appear in stories published by DC , Batwoman 's sexual orientation drew wide media attention following her reintroduction , as well as both praise and criticism from the general public . 
 In December 2014 , DC Comics announced that they were canceling the Batwoman series .

 Kathy Kane is primarily associated with the Silver Age of Comic Books . In the aftermath of the attacks on comics in the early 1950s , the Batwoman was the first of several characters that would make up the ' Batman Family ' . Since the family formula had proven very successful for the Superman franchise , editor Jack Schiff suggested to Batman creator , Bob Kane , that he create one for the Batman . A female was chosen first , to offset the charges made by Fredric Wertham that Batman and the original Robin , Dick Grayson , were homosexual . Kathy Kane and alter ego Batwoman first appeared in Detective Comics # 233 ( July 1956 ) . In the character 's debut issue , Batwoman is introduced as a female rival to the crime @-@ fighting prowess of Batman :
