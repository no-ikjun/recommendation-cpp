 The forward Mk38 Director ( pictured ) was situated on top of the fire control tower . The director was equipped with optical sights , optical Mark 45 Rangefinder ( the long thin boxes sticking out each side ) , and a Mark 13 Fire Control Radar antenna ( the rectangular shape sitting on top ) . The purpose of the director was to track the target 's present bearing and range . This could be done optically by the men inside using the sights and Rangefinder , or electronically with the radar . ( The FC radar was the preferred method . ) The present position of the target was called the Line @-@ Of @-@ Sight ( LOS ) , and it was continuously sent down to the Mk 8 Rangekeeper in the plotting room by Synchro transmitters . Also , when not using the radar 's display to determine Spots , the director was the optical spotting station . 
 = = = = = Plotting room = = = = = 
 The forward main battery plotting room was located below the waterline and inside the armored belt . It housed the forward system 's Mark 8 Rangekeeper , Mark 41 Stable Vertical , <unk> FC Radar controls and displays , Parallax Correctors , Fire Control Switchboard , battle telephone switchboard , battery status indicators , assistant Gunnery Officers , and Fire Control Technicians ( FTs ) . 
 The <unk> Rangekeeper was an electromechanical analog computer whose function was to continuously calculate the gun 's bearing and elevation , Line @-@ Of @-@ Fire ( LOF ) , to hit a future position of the target . It did this by automatically receiving information from the director ( LOS ) , the FC Radar ( range ) , the ship 's gyrocompass ( true ship 's course ) , the ship 's <unk> log ( ship 's speed ) , the Stable Vertical ( ship 's roll and pitch ) , and the ship 's anemometer ( relative wind speed and direction ) . Also , before the surface action started , the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery 's gun barrels , and air density . With all this information , the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target . It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target 's present position ( LOS ) and future position at the end of the projectile 's time of flight . To this bearing and range offset , it added corrections for gravity , wind , Magnus Effect of the spinning projectile , earth 's curvature , and coriolis effect . The result was the turret 's bearing and elevation orders ( LOF ) . During the surface action , range and deflection Spots and target altitude ( not zero during Gun Fire Support ) were manually entered . 
 The Mk 41 Stable Vertical ( also called Gun Director ) was a vertical seeking gyroscope . Its function was to establish and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane . With the horizontal plane established , the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the horizontal plane . These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched . Mounted waist high on its side were the battery 's firing keys . ( see picture ) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key , and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire . The center key ( with bumps on its handle for tactile identification ) was the Automatic Firing Key . When this key was held closed , the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship 's deck was parallel the horizontal plane . Also , if the sea state was such that the turrets ' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship 's motion , the guns could be held at a fixed elevation , and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described . The right key was the Hand Firing Key . It bypassed the Mk 41 , and fired the guns directly . 
 The Mk 13 FC Radar supplied present target range , and it showed the fall of shot around the target so the Gunnery Officer could correct the system 's aim with range and deflection spots put into the Rangekeeper . It could also automatically track the target by controlling the director 's bearing power drive . Because of radar , Fire Control systems are able to track and fire at targets at a greater range and with increased accuracy during the day , night , or inclement weather . This was demonstrated in November 1942 when the battleship USS Washington engaged the Imperial Japanese Navy battlecruiser Kirishima at a range of 18 @,@ 500 yards ( 16 @,@ 900 m ) at night . The engagement left Kirishima in flames , and she was ultimately scuttled by her crew . This capability gave the United States Navy a major advantage in World War II , as the Japanese did not develop radar or automated fire control to the level of the US Navy and were at a significant disadvantage . See also The Battle of Surigao Strait ( 25 October 1944 ) during the WWII Leyte Gulf landings . 
 The Parallax Correctors were needed because the turrets were located hundreds of feet from the director . There was one for each turret , and each had the turret / director distance manually set in . They automatically received Relative Target Bearing ( bearing from own ship 's bow ) , and Target Range . They corrected the bearing order for each turret so that all rounds fired in a salvo converged on the same point . 
 The Fire Control Switchboard configured the battery . With it , the Gunnery Officer could mix and match the three turrets to the two GFCSs . He could have the turrets all controlled by the forward system , all controlled by the aft system , or split the battery to shoot at two targets . 
 The assistant Gunnery Officers and Fire Control Technicians operated the equipment , talked to the turrets and ship 's command by sound @-@ powered telephone , and watched the Rangekeeper 's dials and system status indicators for problems . If a problem arose , they could correct the problem , or reconfigure the system to mitigate its effect . 
 = = = = Turret fire control systems = = = = 
 Turrets 2 & 3 had optical rangefinders and ballistics computers . ( The rangefinders are the boxes on the turret 's rear corners ) . If in a surface action the GFCSs were damaged , the Turret Officer could turn the Auto @-@ Local rotary switch to Local and continue the action using the turret 's fire control equipment . 
 = = = Ammunition = = = 
 The large caliber guns were designed to fire two different 16 @-@ inch shells : an armor @-@ piercing round for anti @-@ ship and anti @-@ structure work and a high explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment . A third type of ammunition for delivering tactical nuclear warheads was developed subsequently . 
 The Mk . 8 APC ( Armor @-@ Piercing , Capped ) shell weighed 2 @,@ 700 lb ( 1225 kg ) and was designed to penetrate the hardened steel armor carried by foreign battleships . At 20 @,@ 000 yards ( 18 km ) the Mk . 8 could penetrate 20 inches ( 500 mm ) of steel armor plate . At the same range , the Mk . 8 could penetrate 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) of reinforced concrete . 
 For unarmored targets and shore bombardment , the 1 @,@ 900 lb ( 862 kg ) Mk . 13 HC ( High @-@ Capacity — referring to the large bursting charge ) shell was available . The Mk . 13 shell would create a crater 50 feet ( 15 m ) wide and 20 feet ( 6 m ) deep upon impact and detonation , and could defoliate trees 400 yards ( 360 m ) from the point of impact . 
 The final type of ammunition developed for the Iowa class were " Katie " shells . These shells were born from the concept of nuclear deterrence that had begun to shape the United States armed forces as the Cold War began . To compete with the Air Force and the Army , which had developed nuclear bombs and nuclear shells for use on the battlefield , the US Navy began a top @-@ secret program to develop Mk . 23 nuclear naval shells with an estimated yield of 15 to 20 kilotons . These shells were designed to be launched from the best seaborne artillery platform available , which at the time were the four ships of the Iowa class . The shells entered development around 1953 , and were reportedly ready by 1956 ; however , it is not known whether they were ever actually deployed on the Iowa @-@ class battleships because the US Navy does not confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard its ships . In 1991 the US unilaterally withdrew its nuclear artillery shells from service , and Russia responded in kind in 1992 . The US removed around 1 @,@ 300 nuclear shells from Europe and reportedly dismantled its last shells by 2003 . 
 = = Secondary battery = = 
 The secondary battery was a dual @-@ purpose weapon system ; it was designed to defend the ship from either surface or airborne threats . The original secondary battery consisted of 10 Mark 28 , Mod 2 twin gun mounts , and four Mark 37 Gun Fire Control Systems . At first , this battery 's effectiveness against aircraft diminished as planes became faster , but this changed toward the end of World War II through a combination of an upgrade to the Mk37 System and the development of the VT ( Variable Time ) proximity fuze . In preparation for the <unk> in the 1960s and 1980s , the battery was updated to the latest gun and fire control system modifications . In the 1968 upgrade to the USS New Jersey for service off Vietnam , three Mark 56 Gun Fire Control Systems were installed , two on either side just forward of the aft stack , and one between the aft mast and the aft Mk 38 Director tower . This increased New Jersey 's anti @-@ aircraft capability , because the Mk 56 system could track and shoot at faster planes . In the 1980s modernization , the Mk 56 GFCSs and four mounts were removed to make room for missiles , leaving the Secondary battery with four Mk 37 GFCSs and six twin mounts on all the Iowa class . By the time of the Gulf War the secondary battery was largely relegated to shore bombardment and littoral defense . Since each battleship carried a small detachment of Marines aboard , the Marines would man one of the 5 @-@ inch gun mounts . 
 = = = Mark 28 , Mod 2 mounts = = = 
 Each Mk 28 Mod 2 Mount carried two Mark 12 , <unk> / <unk> gun assemblies , electric @-@ hydraulic drives for bearing and elevation , optical sights , automatic fuze setter , automatic sight setter , and an upper handling room . Each armored twin mount weighed 170 @,@ 635 lb ( 77 @,@ 399 kg ) . The mount had a crew of 13 , not including the ammunition movers in the upper handling room and magazines , drawn from the sailors and Marines serving aboard the ship . 
 = = = = Mark 12 gun assembly = = = = 
 The <unk> Gun Assembly ( pictured ) was a semi @-@ automatic , power rammed , vertical sliding @-@ wedge breech block type gun . Since this gun assembly fired semi @-@ fixed ammunition , ( pictured ) each round was delivered to the guns in two pieces . Each gun , in this twin mount , had its own projectile hoist and powder case hoist from the upper handling room . The electric @-@ hydraulic projectile hoist would deliver a projectile next to the projectile man with the nose down and waist high . The electric @-@ hydraulic powder case hoist poked the case through a powder scuttle in the gun room 's deck just next to the powder man 's feet . At the load command , the powder man would slip a primer protector off the end of the powder case , extract the case from the scuttle , and lift it into the gun 's rammer tray . Meanwhile , the projectile man would pull a projectile out of the hoist , and place it in the rammer tray in front of the powder case . Then , as he turned to get the next projectile out of the hoist , the projectile man would pull down on the rammer lever . This caused the power rammer to ram the projectile and powder case into the chamber . As the powder case cleared the top of the breechblock , the block would rise to seal the chamber . The gun was ready to fire . The case combination primer in the base of the powder case could be fired either electrically or by percussion . Electrical firing was the preferred method because the firing circuit could be energized by firing keys down in the plotting room when firing salvos at surface targets , or up in the director when firing at air targets . Percussion firing could be executed by the Pointer ( man controlling elevation ) by pushing a foot treadle . When the gun fired , the recoil 's rearward motion returned the rammer lever to the up position , and the rammer would drive back to the rear of the rammer tray . During counter @-@ recoil , the breechblock was automatically lowered and the spent powder case was ejected from the chamber . When the gun returned to battery , a blast of compressed air was sent down the bore to clean it out . The gun was ready to be reloaded . 
 = = = = Electric @-@ hydraulic drives = = = = 
 The electric @-@ hydraulic drives powered the mount 's motion . The three modes of drive operation were automatic , local , and manual . In automatic , the drives would follow the bearing and elevation orders of the fire control system . In local , the drives would follow the motion of the trainer 's and pointer 's hand wheels . ( This is similar to power steering on a car . ) Manual was direct gear linkage from the hand wheels to move the mount with no power assist . 
 = = = = Sights = = = = 
 The <unk> sights ( the boxes on the side of the mount ) allowed the trainer and pointer to see the target from inside the armored enclosure . Each sight had movable prisms that allowed its line of sight to be moved relative to the barrel 's bore axis . These prisms could be controlled by the fire control system when the mount was in Automatic , or by the mount 's sight setter operator when the mount was in Local . Local control was not the preferred combat method , but it could be used if the fire control systems were damaged . The mount captain was trained in aiming and correcting the fall of shot . 
 = = = = Upper handling room = = = = 
 The upper handling room was just below the visible part of the mount . It was armored and reinforced to support the weight of the mount . A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated . Hanging from the mount , and rotating with it , was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount . This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists . In the center of the room there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount . This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount . Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads . Close by , either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine . The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount . During quiet spells , they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines . 
 = = = Mark 37 gun fire control system = = = 
 The Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System ( GFCS ) was the primary Fire Control System for the Secondary Battery . There were four Mk37 GFCSs on board ; one forward above the navigation bridge , two amidships on either side of the forward stack , and one aft between the aft Mk38 Director and Turret three . The major components of the Mk 37 GFCS were the Mk 37 Director , and the equipment in the plotting room . 
 = = = = Mark 37 director = = = = 
 The function of the Mark 37 director ( pictured ) was to track the present position of the target in bearing , elevation , and range . To do this , it had optical sights ( the rectangular widows on the front ) , an optical rangefinder ( the tubes sticking out each side ) , and Fire Control Radar antennas . On the MK 37 Director pictured , the rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar , and the parabolic antenna on the left is for the Mk 22 FC radar . They were part of an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft . The Director Officer also had a Slew Sight that he could use to quickly point the director towards a new target . 
 = = = = Plotting room = = = = 
 The secondary battery plotting rooms were down below the waterline and inside the armor belt . They contained four complete sets of fire control equipment needed to aim and shoot at four targets . Each set included a Mark 1A computer , a Mark 6 Stable Element , FC Radar controls and displays , Parallax correctors , a switchboard , and crew to operate it all . 
 The Mark 1A Fire Control Computer ( pictured ) was an electro @-@ mechanical analog ballistic computer . Its function was to automatically aim the guns so that a fired projectile would collide with the target . This was the same function as the main battery 's Mk 8 Rangekeeper above except that some of the targets the Mark 1A had to deal with also moved in elevation — and much faster . For a surface target , the Secondary Battery 's Fire Control problem is the same as the Main Battery 's with the same type inputs and outputs . The major difference between the two computers was their ballistics calculations . The amount of gun elevation needed to project a 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) shell 9 nmi ( 17 km ) is different than the elevation needed to project a 16 @-@ inch shell the same distance . The ballistics calculations in these mechanical analog computers were performed by mechanisms like differential gears , levers , and small rods riding on the surface of three @-@ dimensional cams . These mechanical adders , multipliers , and table lookup devices were handmade at the factory , and were buried deep in the workings of the computer . It was not possible to change a computer 's ballistics at sea until the advent of fast digital computers . The anti @-@ aircraft fire control problem was more complicated because it had the additional requirement of tracking the target in elevation and making target predictions in three dimensions . The outputs of the Mk 1A were the same ( gun bearing and elevation ) , except fuze time was added . The fuze time was needed because the ideal of directly hitting the fast moving aircraft with the projectile was impractical . With fuze time set into the shell , it was hoped that it would explode near enough to the target to destroy it with the shock wave and shrapnel . Towards the end of World War II , the invention of the VT proximity fuze eliminated the need to use the fuze time calculation and its possible error . This greatly increased the odds of destroying an air target . 
 The function of the Mk 6 Stable Element ( pictured ) in this fire control system was the same as the function of the Mk 41 Stable Vertical in the main battery system above . It was a vertical seeking gyroscope that supplied the system with a stable up direction on a rolling and pitching ship . In surface mode , it replaced the director 's elevation signal . It also had the surface mode firing keys . 
 The Fire @-@ control radar used on the Mk 37 GFCS has evolved . In the 1930s , the Mk 37 Director did not have a radar antenna . Then in September 1941 , the rectangular Mk 4 Fire @-@ control radar antenna was mounted on top . Soon aircraft flew faster , and in <unk> to increase speed and accuracy the Mk 4 was replaced by a combination of the Mk 12 ( rectangular antenna ) and Mk 22 ( parabolic antenna ) radars . ( pictured ) Finally , the circular SPG 25 antenna was mounted on top as seen in the USS Wisconsin photo at the top of this article . ( Look at the Mk 37 Director just above the bridge . ) 
 = = Anti @-@ aircraft batteries = = 
 Since they were designed to escort the US fleet of fast attack aircraft carriers , the Iowa @-@ class battleships were all intended to carry a fearsome array of anti @-@ aircraft guns to protect US aircraft carriers from Japanese fighters and dive bombers . This array included up to 20 quad 40 mm mounts and 49 single 20 mm mounts . In the 1968 USS New Jersey re @-@ activation for service off Vietnam , the 20 mm and 40 mm batteries were removed . In the 1980s re @-@ activation , all the ships with 20 mm and 40 mm batteries had them removed , and four Phalanx CIWS mounts were added to all . 
 = = = Oerlikon 20 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns = = = 
 The Oerlikon 20 mm anti @-@ aircraft gun was one of the most heavily produced anti @-@ aircraft guns of the Second World War ; the US alone manufactured a total of 124 @,@ 735 of these guns . When activated in 1941 these guns replaced the 0 @.@ 50 " / 90 ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) M2 Browning MG on a one @-@ for @-@ one basis . The Oerlikon 20 mm AA gun remained the primary anti @-@ aircraft weapon of the United States Navy until the introduction of the 40 mm Bofors AA gun in 1943 . 
 These guns were air @-@ cooled and used a gas blowback recoil system . Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II the barrel of the 20 mm Oerlikon gun did not recoil , the breechblock never locked against the breech and actually moved forward when the gun fired . This weapon lacked a counter @-@ recoil brake , as the force of the counter @-@ recoil was checked by the explosion of the next round of ammunition . 
 Between December 1941 and September 1944 , 32 % of all Japanese aircraft downed were credited to this weapon , with the high point being 48 @.@ 3 % for the second half of 1942 . In 1943 the revolutionary Mark 14 Gun Sight was introduced which made these guns even more effective ; however , the 20 mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese Kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II . They were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier 40 mm Bofors AA guns . 
 = = = Bofors 40 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns = = = 
 Arguably the best light anti @-@ aircraft weapon of World War II , the Bofors 40 mm anti @-@ aircraft gun was used on almost every major warship in the US and UK fleet during World War II from about 1943 to 1945 . Although a descendant of German and Swedish designs , the Bofors mounts used by the US Navy during World War II had been heavily " Americanized " to bring the guns up to the standards placed on them by the US Navy . This resulted in a guns system set to English standards ( now known as the Standard System ) with interchangeable ammunition , which simplified the logistics situation for World War II . When coupled with electric @-@ hydraulic drives for greater speed and the Mark 51 Director ( pictured ) for improved accuracy , the Bofors 40 mm gun became a fearsome adversary , accounting for roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945 . 
 When the Iowa @-@ class battleships were launched in 1943 and 1944 they carried twenty quad Bofors 40 mm gun mounts , which they used for defense against enemy aircraft . These heavy guns were also employed in the protection of allied aircraft carriers operating in the Pacific Theater of World War II . These guns remained on the battleships Iowa , Missouri , and Wisconsin from the time they were commissioned until they were reactivated for service in the 1980s . As each battleship arrived for modernization during the early and mid @-@ 1980s the Bofors mounts that remained aboard were removed due in large part to the ineffectiveness of such manually aimed weapons against modern day jet fighters and enemy missiles . The replacement for the Bofors guns was the US Navy 's Phalanx Close @-@ in weapon system ( CIWS ) . 
 = = = Phalanx CIWS = = = 
 During their modernization in the 1980s , each Iowa @-@ class battleship was equipped with four of the US Navy 's Phalanx CIWS mounts , two of which sat just behind the bridge and two which were forward and outboard of the after ship 's funnel . Iowa , New Jersey , and Missouri were equipped with the Block 0 version of the Phalanx , while Wisconsin received the first operational Block 1 version in 1988 . 
 Developed as the final line of defense ( terminal defense or point defense ) against anti @-@ ship missiles , the Phalanx Close in Weapon System ( CIWS , pronounced " sea @-@ whiz " ) is the anti @-@ aircraft / anti @-@ missile gun currently in use in the US Navy . Due to their distinctive shape , they have been nicknamed " <unk> " , in reference to the droid R2 @-@ D2 from the Star Wars universe . Designed in the early 1970s by General Dynamics , and currently produced by Raytheon , the Phalanx CIWS mount utilizes a 20 mm M61 Vulcan Gatling gun to destroy enemy missiles and aircraft that manage to escape anti @-@ missile and anti @-@ aircraft missiles fired from friendly ships . 
 The Phalanx guns worked by using a search radar and a tracking radar to follow targets that approached within 1 to 1 @.@ 5 nautical miles ( 2 @.@ 8 km ) . When a target was within this range the CIWS mount moved to track the target while simultaneously evaluating the target against several preset criteria to determine the next course of action . Depending on whether the target criteria were met , the Phalanx mount automatically engaged the incoming target if it was judged to be hostile in nature , or the system recommended that the Phalanx operator engage the target . 
 Phalanx CIWS mounts were used by Missouri and Wisconsin during the 1991 Gulf War ; Wisconsin alone fired 5 @,@ 200 20 mm Phalanx CIWS rounds . Missouri also received Phalanx fire during a " friendly fire " incident in which the Oliver Hazard Perry @-@ class guided missile frigate USS Jarrett mistook chaff fired by Missouri for a legitimate target and shot at Missouri . Rounds from this attack struck the ship in the bulkhead above the famed " surrender deck " and bounced off the armor , one round penetrated the forward funnel and passed completely through it , and another round penetrated a bulkhead and embedded in an interior passageway of the ship . 
 = = Missiles = = 
 During the modernization in the 1980s , three important weapons were added to the Iowa @-@ class battleships . The first was the CIWS anti @-@ aircraft / anti @-@ missile system discussed above . The other two were missiles for use against both land and sea targets . At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships ; however , it was determined that the system could not withstand the over @-@ pressure effects when the main battery was fired . 
 = = = Tomahawk land attack missile = = = 
 The BGM @-@ 109 Tomahawk Land Attack Missile ( TLAM ) was first introduced in the 1970s , and entered service with the United States in 1983 . Designed as a long @-@ range , all @-@ weather , subsonic cruise missile , the Tomahawk was capable of reaching targets at a much greater range than the 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns on the Iowa @-@ class ships . When added to the battleships in the 1980s the Tomahawk became the longest @-@ ranged weapon carried by the battleships . 
 Owing to the original 1938 design of the battleships , the Tomahawk missiles could not be fitted to the Iowa @-@ class unless the battleships were physically rebuilt in such a way as to accommodate the missile mounts that would be needed to store and launch the Tomahawks . This realization prompted the removal of the anti @-@ aircraft guns previously installed on the Iowas and the removal of four of each of the battleships ' ten 5 " / 38 DP mounts . The mid and aft end of the battleships were then rebuilt to accommodate the missile magazines . This resulted in the construction of two separate platforms , one located between the first and second funnel and one located behind the second funnel , to which MK @-@ 143 Armored Box Launcher ( ABL ) canisters could be attached . Each Armored Box Launcher carried four missiles , and each of the battleships was outfitted with eight canisters , enabling the Iowa @-@ class to carry and fire a total of 32 Tomahawk missiles . 
 The type of Tomahawk carried by the battleships varied , as there were three basic configurations for the Tomahawk : the Anti @-@ Ship Missile ( <unk> ) , the Land @-@ Attack Missile @-@ Conventional ( TLAM @-@ C ) , and the Land @-@ Attack Missile @-@ Nuclear ( TLAM @-@ N ) . Each version was similar in appearance and used the same airframe body and launcher . The conventional Tomahawk missile could carry a 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 450 kg ) explosive warhead or submunitions which used the missile body to reach their destination . The nuclear variant carried a 200 kt W80 nuclear warhead . 
 The TLAM could be equipped with an inertial and terrain contour matching ( <unk> ) radar guidance package to find and destroy its target . The <unk> radar used a stored map reference to compare with the actual terrain to determine the missile 's position . If necessary , a course correction was then made to place the missile on course to the target . Terminal guidance in the target area was provided by the optical Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation ( <unk> ) system , which compared a stored image of target with the actual target image . 
 The firing weight of the Tomahawk was 2 @,@ 650 lb ( 1 @,@ 200 kg ) plus a 550 lb ( 250 kg ) booster . It had a cruising speed of 0 @.@ 5 Mach and an attack speed of 0 @.@ 75 Mach . The anti @-@ ship version of the Tomahawk had an operating range of 250 nmi ( 460 km ) and a maximum range of 470 nmi ( 870 km ) , while the conventional land attack missile version had a maximum range of 675 nmi ( 1 @,@ 250 km ) and TLAM @-@ N had maximum range of 1 @,@ 500 nmi ( 2 @,@ 800 km ) . 
 During the 1991 Gulf War , USS Missouri and USS Wisconsin used ABL launchers to fire Tomahawk missiles at Iraqi targets during Operation Desert Storm . Wisconsin served as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile ( TLAM ) strike commander for the Persian Gulf , directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and fired a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign . 
 = = = Harpoon anti @-@ ship missile = = = 
 For protection against enemy ships , the Iowa class was outfitted with the Harpoon Weapons System . The system consisted of four Mk 141 " shock @-@ hardened " quad cell launchers designed to carry and fire the McDonnell Douglas RGM @-@ 84 Harpoon anti @-@ ship missile . Each Harpoon was placed in one of four Mk 141 launchers located alongside the aft stack ; eight per side , in two pods of four . The weight of the Harpoon at firing was 1 @,@ 530 lb ( 690 kg ) , which included a booster weighing about 362 lb ( 164 kg ) . The cruising speed was 0 @.@ 87 Mach and the maximum range was 64 nmi ( 119 km ) in Range and Bearing Launch mode and 85 nmi ( 157 km ) in Bearing Only Launch mode . 
 When an Iowa class battleship fired a Harpoon Missile , a booster propelled the missile away from the ship ; after approximately 5 miles ( 8 km ) , the booster dropped away . After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the missile to the target . The stabilizing and actuator fins , which helped to guide the missile to its target , were stored folded in the canister and sprang into position after launching . These fins directed the missile to the target through inputs from the AN / SWG @-@ 1 Harpoon Fire Control System . 
 The battleships carried and used the RGM / UGM @-@ 84 variants of the Harpoon Missile , which was designed to be fired by surface ships . The version used a solid @-@ fueled rocket booster in an A / <unk> @-@ 2 or -3 booster section , which was discarded after burn @-@ out . The maximum range was around 140 kilometres ( 76 nmi ) . 
 After launch , the missile was guided towards the target location as determined by the ship using a three @-@ axis Attitude Reference Assembly ( ATA ) in an AN / DSQ @-@ 44 guidance section . The ATA was less accurate than a full @-@ fledged inertial system , but good enough for Harpoon 's range . For stabilization and control , the AGM @-@ 84A had four fixed cruciform wings ( 3x BSU @-@ 42 / B , 1x BSU @-@ 43 / B ) and four movable BSU @-@ 44 / B tail fins . The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position , its AN / DSQ @-@ 28 J @-@ band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the target . The radar switch @-@ on distance could be set to lower or higher values , the former requiring a more precisely @-@ known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures ( ECM ) . 
 An alternative launch mode was called Bearing @-@ Only Launch ( <unk> ) . In this mode , the missile was launched in the general direction of the target , and its radar activated from the beginning to scan for the target in a + / - 45 ° sector in front of the flight path . Once a target was located and the seeker locked the <unk> @-@ 84A missile climbed rapidly to about 1800 m before diving on the target in what was known as a " pop @-@ up maneuver " . The 221 kg ( 488 lb ) <unk> @-@ 18 / B penetrating blast @-@ fragmentation warhead ( in the WAU @-@ 3 ( V ) / B warhead section ) was triggered by a time @-@ delayed impact fuze . When no target was acquired after radar activation , the Harpoon would self @-@ destruct .

 Paleontology or palaeontology ( / <unk> / , / <unk> / or / <unk> / , / <unk> / ) is the scientific study of life that existed prior to , and sometimes including , the start of the Holocene Epoch ( roughly 11 @,@ 700 years before present ) . It includes the study of fossils to determine organisms ' evolution and interactions with each other and their environments ( their paleoecology ) . Paleontological observations have been documented as far back as the 5th century BC . The science became established in the 18th century as a result of Georges Cuvier 's work on comparative anatomy , and developed rapidly in the 19th century . The term itself originates from Greek <unk> , <unk> , i.e. " old , ancient " , <unk> , on ( gen. <unk> ) , i.e. " being , creature " and λόγος , logos , i.e. " speech , thought , study " . 
 Paleontology lies on the border between biology and geology , but differs from archaeology in that it excludes the study of anatomically modern humans . It now uses techniques drawn from a wide range of sciences , including biochemistry , mathematics , and engineering . Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life , almost all the way back to when Earth became capable of supporting life , about 3 @,@ 800 million years ago . As knowledge has increased , paleontology has developed specialised sub @-@ divisions , some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental history , such as ancient climates . 
 Body fossils and trace fossils are the principal types of evidence about ancient life , and geochemical evidence has helped to decipher the evolution of life before there were organisms large enough to leave body fossils . Estimating the dates of these remains is essential but difficult : sometimes adjacent rock layers allow radiometric dating , which provides absolute dates that are accurate to within 0 @.@ 5 % , but more often paleontologists have to rely on relative dating by solving the " jigsaw puzzles " of biostratigraphy . Classifying ancient organisms is also difficult , as many do not fit well into the Linnean taxonomy that is commonly used for classifying living organisms , and paleontologists more often use cladistics to draw up evolutionary " family trees " . The final quarter of the 20th century saw the development of molecular phylogenetics , which investigates how closely organisms are related by measuring how similar the DNA is in their genomes . Molecular phylogenetics has also been used to estimate the dates when species diverged , but there is controversy about the reliability of the molecular clock on which such estimates depend . 
 = = Overview = = 
 The simplest definition is " the study of ancient life " . Paleontology seeks information about several aspects of past organisms : " their identity and origin , their environment and evolution , and what they can tell us about the Earth 's organic and inorganic past " . 
 = = = A historical science = = = 
 Paleontology is one of the historical sciences , along with archaeology , geology , astronomy , cosmology , philology and history itself . This means that it aims to describe phenomena of the past and reconstruct their causes . Hence it has three main elements : description of the phenomena ; developing a general theory about the causes of various types of change ; and applying those theories to specific facts . 
 When trying to explain past phenomena , paleontologists and other historical scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then look for a smoking gun , a piece of evidence that indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others . Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research . For example , the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium @-@ rich layer at the Cretaceous – Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event . 
 The other main type of science is experimental science , which is often said to work by conducting experiments to disprove hypotheses about the workings and causes of natural phenomena – note that this approach cannot confirm a hypothesis is correct , since some later experiment may disprove it . However , when confronted with totally unexpected phenomena , such as the first evidence for invisible radiation , experimental scientists often use the same approach as historical scientists : construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then look for a " smoking gun " . 
 = = = Related sciences = = = 
 Paleontology lies on the boundary between biology and geology since paleontology focuses on the record of past life but its main source of evidence is fossils , which are found in rocks . For historical reasons paleontology is part of the geology departments of many universities , because in the 19th century and early 20th century geology departments found paleontological evidence important for estimating the ages of rocks while biology departments showed little interest . 
 Paleontology also has some overlap with archaeology , which primarily works with objects made by humans and with human remains , while paleontologists are interested in the characteristics and evolution of humans as organisms . When dealing with evidence about humans , archaeologists and paleontologists may work together – for example paleontologists might identify animal or plant fossils around an archaeological site , to discover what the people who lived there ate ; or they might analyze the climate at the time when the site was inhabited by humans . 
 In addition paleontology often uses techniques derived from other sciences , including biology , osteology , ecology , chemistry , physics and mathematics . For example , geochemical signatures from rocks may help to discover when life first arose on Earth , and analyses of carbon isotope ratios may help to identify climate changes and even to explain major transitions such as the Permian – Triassic extinction event . A relatively recent discipline , molecular phylogenetics , often helps by using comparisons of different modern organisms ' DNA and RNA to re @-@ construct evolutionary " family trees " ; it has also been used to estimate the dates of important evolutionary developments , although this approach is controversial because of doubts about the reliability of the " molecular clock " . Techniques developed in engineering have been used to analyse how ancient organisms might have worked , for example how fast Tyrannosaurus could move and how powerful its bite was . It is relatively commonplace to study fossils using X @-@ ray microtomography A combination of paleontology , biology , and archaeology , <unk> is the study of endocranial casts ( or endocasts ) of species related to humans to learn about the evolution of human brains . 
 Paleontology even contributes to astrobiology , the investigation of possible life on other planets , by developing models of how life may have arisen and by providing techniques for detecting evidence of life . 
 = = = Subdivisions = = = 
 As knowledge has increased , paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions . Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on fossils of vertebrates , from the earliest fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals . Invertebrate paleontology deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs , arthropods , annelid worms and echinoderms . <unk> focuses on the study of fossil plants , but traditionally includes the study of fossil algae and fungi . <unk> , the study of pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists , straddles the border between paleontology and botany , as it deals with both living and fossil organisms . <unk> deals with all microscopic fossil organisms , regardless of the group to which they belong . 
 Instead of focusing on individual organisms , paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms , such as their places in food chains , and the two @-@ way interaction between organisms and their environment . One example is the development of oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria , which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems . This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere . Together , these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells , from which all multicellular organisms are built . 
 Paleoclimatology , although sometimes treated as part of paleoecology , focuses more on the history of Earth 's climate and the mechanisms that have changed it – which have sometimes included evolutionary developments , for example the rapid expansion of land plants in the Devonian period removed more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , reducing the greenhouse effect and thus helping to cause an ice age in the Carboniferous period . 
 <unk> , the use of fossils to work out the chronological order in which rocks were formed , is useful to both paleontologists and geologists . Biogeography studies the spatial distribution of organisms , and is also linked to geology , which explains how Earth 's geography has changed over time . 
 = = = Body fossils = = = 
 Fossils of organisms ' bodies are usually the most informative type of evidence . The most common types are wood , bones , and shells . <unk> is a rare event , and most fossils are destroyed by erosion or metamorphism before they can be observed . Hence the fossil record is very incomplete , increasingly so further back in time . Despite this , it is often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life 's history . There are also biases in the fossil record : different environments are more favorable to the preservation of different types of organism or parts of organisms . Further , only the parts of organisms that were already mineralised are usually preserved , such as the shells of molluscs . Since most animal species are soft @-@ bodied , they decay before they can become fossilised . As a result , although there are 30 @-@ plus phyla of living animals , two @-@ thirds have never been found as fossils . 
 Occasionally , unusual environments may preserve soft tissues . These lagerstätten allow paleontologists to examine the internal anatomy of animals that in other sediments are represented only by shells , spines , claws , etc . – if they are preserved at all . However , even lagerstätten present an incomplete picture of life at the time . The majority of organisms living at the time are probably not represented because lagerstätten are restricted to a narrow range of environments , e.g. where soft @-@ bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly by events such as mudslides ; and the exceptional events that cause quick burial make it difficult to study the normal environments of the animals . The sparseness of the fossil record means that organisms are expected to exist long before and after they are found in the fossil record – this is known as the Signor @-@ Lipps effect . 
 = = = Trace fossils = = = 
 Trace fossils consist mainly of tracks and burrows , but also include coprolites ( fossil feces ) and marks left by feeding . Trace fossils are particularly significant because they represent a data source that is not limited to animals with easily fossilised hard parts , and they reflect organisms ' behaviours . Also many traces date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that are thought to have been capable of making them . Whilst exact assignment of trace fossils to their makers is generally impossible , traces may for example provide the earliest physical evidence of the appearance of moderately complex animals ( comparable to earthworms ) . 
 = = = Geochemical observations = = = 
 Geochemical observations may help to deduce the global level of biological activity , or the affinity of certain fossils . For example , geochemical features of rocks may reveal when life first arose on Earth , and may provide evidence of the presence of eukaryotic cells , the type from which all multicellular organisms are built . Analyses of carbon isotope ratios may help to explain major transitions such as the Permian – Triassic extinction event . 
 = = Classifying ancient organisms = = 
 Naming groups of organisms in a way that is clear and widely agreed is important , as some disputes in paleontology have been based just on misunderstandings over names . Linnean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms , but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones . For example : it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher @-@ level grouping , e.g. genus or family or order ; this is important since the Linnean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels , and hence if a group is moved to a different level it must be renamed . 
 Paleontologists generally use approaches based on cladistics , a technique for working out the evolutionary " family tree " of a set of organisms . It works by the logic that , if groups B and C have more similarities to each other than either has to group A , then B and C are more closely related to each other than either is to A. Characters that are compared may be anatomical , such as the presence of a notochord , or molecular , by comparing sequences of DNA or proteins . The result of a successful analysis is a hierarchy of clades – groups that share a common ancestor . Ideally the " family tree " has only two branches leading from each node ( " junction " ) , but sometimes there is too little information to achieve this and paleontologists have to make do with junctions that have several branches . The cladistic technique is sometimes fallible , as some features , such as wings or camera eyes , evolved more than once , convergently – this must be taken into account in analyses . 
 Evolutionary developmental biology , commonly abbreviated to " Evo Devo " , also helps paleontologists to produce " family trees " , and understand fossils . For example , the embryological development of some modern brachiopods suggests that brachiopods may be descendants of the halkieriids , which became extinct in the Cambrian period . 
 = = Estimating the dates of organisms = = 
 Paleontology seeks to map out how living things have changed through time . A substantial hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are . Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating . This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age , and can be accurate to within 0 @.@ 5 % or better . Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work , its basic principle is simple : the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known , and so the ratio of the radioactive element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock . Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin , and so the only fossil @-@ bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers . 
 Consequently , paleontologists must usually rely on stratigraphy to date fossils . Stratigraphy is the science of deciphering the " layer @-@ cake " that is the sedimentary record , and has been compared to a jigsaw puzzle . Rocks normally form relatively horizontal layers , with each layer younger than the one underneath it . If a fossil is found between two layers whose ages are known , the fossil 's age must lie between the two known ages . Because rock sequences are not continuous , but may be broken up by faults or periods of erosion , it is very difficult to match up rock beds that are not directly next to one another . However , fossils of species that survived for a relatively short time can be used to link up isolated rocks : this technique is called biostratigraphy . For instance , the conodont <unk> <unk> has a short range in the Middle Ordovician period . If rocks of unknown age are found to have traces of E. <unk> , they must have a mid @-@ Ordovician age . Such index fossils must be distinctive , be globally distributed and have a short time range to be useful . However , misleading results are produced if the index fossils turn out to have longer fossil ranges than first thought . Stratigraphy and biostratigraphy can in general provide only relative dating ( A was before B ) , which is often sufficient for studying evolution . However , this is difficult for some time periods , because of the problems involved in matching up rocks of the same age across different continents . 
 Family @-@ tree relationships may also help to narrow down the date when lineages first appeared . For instance , if fossils of B or C date to X million years ago and the calculated " family tree " says A was an ancestor of B and C , then A must have evolved more than X million years ago . 
 It is also possible to estimate how long ago two living clades diverged – i.e. approximately how long ago their last common ancestor must have lived – by assuming that DNA mutations accumulate at a constant rate . These " molecular clocks " , however , are fallible , and provide only a very approximate timing : for example , they are not sufficiently precise and reliable for estimating when the groups that feature in the Cambrian explosion first evolved , and estimates produced by different techniques may vary by a factor of two . 
 = = Overview of the history of life = = 
 The evolutionary history of life stretches back to over 3 @,@ 000 million years ago , possibly as far as 3 @,@ 800 million years ago . Earth formed about 4 @,@ 570 million years ago and , after a collision that formed the Moon about 40 million years later , may have cooled quickly enough to have oceans and an atmosphere about 4 @,@ 440 million years ago . However , there is evidence on the Moon of a Late Heavy Bombardment from 4 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 800 million years ago . If , as seems likely , such a bombardment struck Earth at the same time , the first atmosphere and oceans may have been stripped away . The oldest clear evidence of life on Earth dates to 3 @,@ 000 million years ago , although there have been reports , often disputed , of fossil bacteria from 3 @,@ 400 million years ago and of geochemical evidence for the presence of life 3 @,@ 800 million years ago . Some scientists have proposed that life on Earth was " seeded " from elsewhere , but most research concentrates on various explanations of how life could have arisen independently on Earth . 
 For about 2 @,@ 000 million years microbial mats , multi @-@ layered colonies of different types of bacteria , were the dominant life on Earth . The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis enabled them to play the major role in the oxygenation of the atmosphere from about 2 @,@ 400 million years ago . This change in the atmosphere increased their effectiveness as nurseries of evolution . While eukaryotes , cells with complex internal structures , may have been present earlier , their evolution speeded up when they acquired the ability to transform oxygen from a poison to a powerful source of energy in their metabolism . This innovation may have come from primitive eukaryotes capturing oxygen @-@ powered bacteria as endosymbionts and transforming them into organelles called mitochondria . The earliest evidence of complex eukaryotes with organelles such as mitochondria , dates from 1 @,@ 850 million years ago . 
 <unk> life is composed only of eukaryotic cells , and the earliest evidence for it is the Francevillian Group Fossils from 2 @,@ 100 million years ago , although specialisation of cells for different functions first appears between 1 @,@ 430 million years ago ( a possible fungus ) and 1 @,@ 200 million years ago ( a probable red alga ) . Sexual reproduction may be a prerequisite for specialisation of cells , as an asexual multicellular organism might be at risk of being taken over by rogue cells that retain the ability to reproduce . 
 The earliest known animals are cnidarians from about 580 million years ago , but these are so modern @-@ looking that the earliest animals must have appeared before then . Early fossils of animals are rare because they did not develop mineralised hard parts that fossilise easily until about 548 million years ago . The earliest modern @-@ looking bilaterian animals appear in the Early Cambrian , along with several " weird wonders " that bear little obvious resemblance to any modern animals . There is a long @-@ running debate about whether this Cambrian explosion was truly a very rapid period of evolutionary experimentation ; alternative views are that modern @-@ looking animals began evolving earlier but fossils of their precursors have not yet been found , or that the " weird wonders " are evolutionary " aunts " and " cousins " of modern groups . Vertebrates remained an obscure group until the first fish with jaws appeared in the Late Ordovician . 
 The spread of life from water to land required organisms to solve several problems , including protection against drying out and supporting themselves against gravity . The earliest evidence of land plants and land invertebrates date back to about 476 million years ago and 490 million years ago respectively . The lineage that produced land vertebrates evolved later but very rapidly between 370 million years ago and 360 million years ago ; recent discoveries have overturned earlier ideas about the history and driving forces behind their evolution . Land plants were so successful that they caused an ecological crisis in the Late Devonian , until the evolution and spread of fungi that could digest dead wood . 
 During the Permian period synapsids , including the ancestors of mammals , may have dominated land environments , but the Permian – Triassic extinction event 251 million years ago came very close to wiping out complex life . The extinctions were apparently fairly sudden , at least among vertebrates . During the slow recovery from this catastrophe a previously obscure group , archosaurs , became the most abundant and diverse terrestrial vertebrates . One archosaur group , the dinosaurs , were the dominant land vertebrates for the rest of the Mesozoic , and birds evolved from one group of dinosaurs . During this time mammals ' ancestors survived only as small , mainly nocturnal insectivores , but this apparent set @-@ back may have accelerated the development of mammalian traits such as endothermy and hair . After the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event 65 million years ago killed off the non @-@ avian dinosaurs – birds are the only surviving dinosaurs – mammals increased rapidly in size and diversity , and some took to the air and the sea . 
 Fossil evidence indicates that flowering plants appeared and rapidly diversified in the Early Cretaceous , between 130 million years ago and 90 million years ago . Their rapid rise to dominance of terrestrial ecosystems is thought to have been propelled by coevolution with pollinating insects . Social insects appeared around the same time and , although they account for only small parts of the insect " family tree " , now form over 50 % of the total mass of all insects . 
 Humans evolved from a lineage of upright @-@ walking apes whose earliest fossils date from over 6 million years ago . Although early members of this lineage had chimp @-@ sized brains , about 25 % as big as modern humans ' , there are signs of a steady increase in brain size after about 3 million years ago . There is a long @-@ running debate about whether modern humans are descendants of a single small population in Africa , which then migrated all over the world less than 200 @,@ 000 years ago and replaced previous hominine species , or arose worldwide at the same time as a result of interbreeding . 
 = = = Mass extinctions = = = 
 Life on earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since 542 million years ago . Although they are disasters at the time , mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on earth . When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another , it is rarely because the new dominant group is " superior " to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one . 
 The fossil record appears to show that the rate of extinction is slowing down , with both the gaps between mass extinctions becoming longer and the average and background rates of extinction decreasing . However , it is not certain whether the actual rate of extinction has altered , since both of these observations could be explained in several ways : 
 The oceans may have become more hospitable to life over the last 500 million years and less vulnerable to mass extinctions : dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths ; the development of life on land reduced the run @-@ off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events ; marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains were less likely to be disrupted . 
 Reasonably complete fossils are very rare , most extinct organisms are represented only by partial fossils , and complete fossils are rarest in the oldest rocks . So paleontologists have mistakenly assigned parts of the same organism to different genera , which were often defined solely to accommodate these finds – the story of Anomalocaris is an example of this . The risk of this mistake is higher for older fossils because these are often unlike parts of any living organism . Many " superfluous " genera are represented by fragments that are not found again , and these " superfluous " genera appear to become extinct very quickly . 
 Biodiversity in the fossil record , which is 
 " the number of distinct genera alive at any given time ; that is , those whose first occurrence predates and whose last occurrence postdates that time " 
 shows a different trend : a fairly swift rise from 542 to 400 million years ago , a slight decline from 400 to 200 million years ago , in which the devastating Permian – Triassic extinction event is an important factor , and a swift rise from 200 million years ago to the present . 
 = = History of paleontology = = 
 Although paleontology became established around 1800 , earlier thinkers had noticed aspects of the fossil record . The ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes ( 570 – 480 BC ) concluded from fossil sea shells that some areas of land were once under water . During the Middle Ages the Persian naturalist Ibn Sina , known as Avicenna in Europe , discussed fossils and proposed a theory of petrifying fluids on which Albert of Saxony elaborated in the 14th century . The Chinese naturalist Shen Kuo ( 1031 – 1095 ) proposed a theory of climate change based on the presence of petrified bamboo in regions that in his time were too dry for bamboo . 
 In early modern Europe , the systematic study of fossils emerged as an integral part of the changes in natural philosophy that occurred during the Age of Reason . In the Italian Renaissance , Leonardo Da Vinci made various significant contributions to the field as well designed numerous fossils . At the end of the 18th century Georges Cuvier 's work established comparative anatomy as a scientific discipline and , by proving that some fossil animals resembled no living ones , demonstrated that animals could become extinct , leading to the emergence of paleontology . The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing role in the development of geology , particularly stratigraphy . 
 The first half of the 19th century saw geological and paleontological activity become increasingly well organised with the growth of geologic societies and museums and an increasing number of professional geologists and fossil specialists . Interest increased for reasons that were not purely scientific , as geology and paleontology helped industrialists to find and exploit natural resources such as coal . 
 This contributed to a rapid increase in knowledge about the history of life on Earth and to progress in the definition of the geologic time scale , largely based on fossil evidence . In 1822 Henri Marie Ducrotay de <unk> , editor of Journal de Physique , coined the word " palaeontology " to refer to the study of ancient living organisms through fossils . As knowledge of life 's history continued to improve , it became increasingly obvious that there had been some kind of successive order to the development of life . This encouraged early evolutionary theories on the transmutation of species . After Charles Darwin published Origin of Species in 1859 , much of the focus of paleontology shifted to understanding evolutionary paths , including human evolution , and evolutionary theory . 
 The last half of the 19th century saw a tremendous expansion in paleontological activity , especially in North America . The trend continued in the 20th century with additional regions of the Earth being opened to systematic fossil collection . Fossils found in China near the end of the 20th century have been particularly important as they have provided new information about the earliest evolution of animals , early fish , dinosaurs and the evolution of birds . The last few decades of the 20th century saw a renewed interest in mass extinctions and their role in the evolution of life on Earth . There was also a renewed interest in the Cambrian explosion that apparently saw the development of the body plans of most animal phyla . The discovery of fossils of the Ediacaran biota and developments in paleobiology extended knowledge about the history of life back far before the Cambrian . 
 Increasing awareness of Gregor Mendel 's pioneering work in genetics led first to the development of population genetics and then in the mid @-@ 20th century to the modern evolutionary synthesis , which explains evolution as the outcome of events such as mutations and horizontal gene transfer , which provide genetic variation , with genetic drift and natural selection driving changes in this variation over time . Within the next few years the role and operation of DNA in genetic inheritance were discovered , leading to what is now known as the " Central Dogma " of molecular biology . In the 1960s molecular phylogenetics , the investigation of evolutionary " family trees " by techniques derived from biochemistry , began to make an impact , particularly when it was proposed that the human lineage had diverged from apes much more recently than was generally thought at the time . Although this early study compared proteins from apes and humans , most molecular phylogenetics research is now based on comparisons of RNA and DNA .

 = Peresvet @-@ class battleship = 
 The Peresvet class was a group of three pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy around the end of the 19th century . Peresvet and Pobeda were transferred to the Pacific Squadron upon completion and based at Port Arthur from 1901 and 1903 , respectively . All three ships were lost by the Russians in the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 ; Peresvet and Pobeda participated in the Battles of Port Arthur and the Yellow Sea and were sunk during the Siege of Port Arthur . Oslyabya , the third ship , sailed to the Far East with the Second Pacific Squadron to relieve the Russian forces blockaded in Port Arthur and was sunk at the Battle of Tsushima with the loss of over half her crew . 
 Peresvet and Pobeda were salvaged after the Japanese captured Port Arthur and incorporated into the Imperial Japanese Navy . Peresvet was sold back to the Russians during World War I , as the two countries were by now allies , and sank after hitting German mines in the Mediterranean in early 1917 while Pobeda , renamed Suwo , remained instead in Japanese service and participated in the Battle of Tsingtao in late 1914 . She became a gunnery training ship in 1917 . The ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and probably scrapped around that time . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 After the humiliating Russian defeat during the Crimean War of 1854 – 55 , General Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich understood that Russia would never be able to outbuild Britain or France , but still needed a maritime strategy that could defend Russia , give the fleet a useful role in peacetime and act as a deterrent . He decided that a guerre de course ( commerce @-@ raiding ) strategy was Russia 's only effective means of attacking the British Empire or France if war broke out and built a series of fast , long @-@ range , armored cruisers like Rossia and Rurik to implement his strategy . The British responded by building the second @-@ class battleships of the Centurion class to defeat the cruisers and the Russians countered with the three ships of the Peresvet class that were designed to support their armored cruisers . This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor . 
 As was common with Russian ships of the time , changes were made while the ships were under construction . The most important was the revision of the secondary armament from eight 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) and five 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 119 mm ) guns to eleven 6 @-@ inch guns and additional light guns . Only two ships were originally planned , but a third was ordered to keep the Baltic Works shipyard busy until a new design could be prepared . Ironically , it was completed before the second ship , despite having been laid down over three years later . 
 The Peresvet @-@ class ships were 434 feet 5 inches ( 132 @.@ 4 m ) long overall , with a beam of 71 feet 6 inches ( 21 @.@ 8 m ) and a draft of 26 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 0 m ) . Designed to displace 12 @,@ 674 long tons ( 12 @,@ 877 t ) , they were 500 – 1 @,@ 700 long tons ( 510 – 1 @,@ 730 t ) overweight and actually displaced 13 @,@ 320 – 14 @,@ 408 long tons ( 13 @,@ 534 – 14 @,@ 639 t ) . To reduce biofouling , the hulls of the first two ships were sheathed with wood and copper , but this was eliminated in Pobeda to reduce weight . The vessels had a partial double bottom and the hull was divided by 10 watertight transverse bulkheads ; a centerline bulkhead divided the forward engine rooms . Each crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men . 
 The ships were powered by three vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam generated by 30 Belleville boilers . The engines were rated at 14 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 813 kW ) , using forced draft , and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . All three ships slightly exceeded their specifications and reached top speeds of 18 @.@ 3 – 18 @.@ 5 knots ( 33 @.@ 9 – 34 @.@ 3 km / h ; 21 @.@ 1 – 21 @.@ 3 mph ) from 14 @,@ 532 – 15 @,@ 578 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 837 – 11 @,@ 617 kW ) during their sea trials .

 The ships ' main battery consisted of four 45 @-@ caliber , 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) guns mounted in electrically powered twin @-@ gun turrets , one forward and one aft of the superstructure . These guns had major development problems as they proved to be too weak to use a full @-@ strength charge of propellant and had to be reworked and the charge reduced . The guns in Peresvet and Oslyabya were the original model and could be elevated to a maximum of + 35 ° , while the reinforced guns used in Pobeda could only elevate to a maximum of + 25 ° . The guns were designed to fire once every 40 seconds , but in service they fired at half that rate . The ships carried 75 rounds for each gun . The older guns fired a 496 @-@ pound ( 225 @.@ 2 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 270 ft / s ( 692 m / s ) while Pobeda 's newer ones may have reached a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 790 m / s ) . At an elevation of + 6 ° , the gun had a range of 8 @,@ 760 yards ( 8 @,@ 010 m ) . The secondary armament of the Peresvet @-@ class ships consisted of eleven 45 @-@ caliber , 6 @-@ inch Canet Model 1891 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns , 10 mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and one underneath the forecastle as a bow chaser . Each gun was provided with 220 rounds . They fired shells that weighed 91 pounds ( 41 @.@ 4 kg ) with a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 792 @.@ 5 m / s ) . They had a range of 12 @,@ 602 yards ( 11 @,@ 523 m ) when fired at an elevation of + 20 ° . 
 Smaller guns were carried for close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats . These included 20 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) Canet Model 1891 guns . Of these guns , eight were mounted in embrasures in the hull , four on the main deck , four on the battery deck and the last four at the corners of the superstructure on the forecastle deck . The ships carried 300 rounds for each gun . The gun had a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 830 ft / s ( 862 m / s ) with its 10 @.@ 8 @-@ pound ( 4 @.@ 91 kg ) shells . It had a range of about 8 @,@ 606 yards ( 7 @,@ 869 m ) at an elevation of + 20 ° . The smaller guns included twenty QF 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns in hull embrasures and on the superstructure . Each gun had 810 rounds provided . They fired a 3 @.@ 2 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) shell . Eight 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns were positioned between the 47 @-@ millimeter guns on the forecastle deck . They fired a 1 @.@ 1 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 50 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 540 ft / s ( 470 m / s ) . 
 The Peresvet class had five 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , three of which were above water , one in the bow and one pair of broadside tubes , and two broadside underwater tubes . The ships carried a total of 12 torpedoes . They also carried 45 mines to be laid to protect their anchorage in remote areas . 
 The ships were fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric rangefinders that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship , usually the waterline and the crow 's nest , to estimate the range . The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target . He transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro @-@ mechanical fire @-@ control transmission system to each gun or turret . Oslyabya and the rest of the Second Pacific Squadron were also fitted with Perepelkin telescopic sights for their guns , but their crews were not trained in how to use them . 
 = = = Protection = = = 
 The first two ships used Harvey armor for most of their armored vertical surfaces except for the gun turrets and their support tubes , which were made from Krupp armor . Pobeda , however , used Krupp armor for all of her heavy vertical armor . Over the machinery spaces , the maximum thickness of their waterline armor belt was 9 inches ( 229 mm ) which reduced to 7 inches ( 178 mm ) abreast the magazines . The belt tapered to a thickness of 5 inches ( 127 mm ) over the machinery spaces and 4 inches ( 102 mm ) over the magazines . The belt covered 312 feet ( 95 @.@ 1 m ) of the ships ' length and was 7 feet 9 inches ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) high , of which the upper 36 inches ( 914 @.@ 4 mm ) was intended to be above the waterline , but the ships were significantly overweight . So much of the belt was submerged that Peresvet only had 14 inches ( 356 mm ) of armor exposed at normal load ; at full load the effect was even greater and the belt was completely submerged . Oslyabya was even more overweight and only had 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of her belt armor showing at normal load . The belt in both ships terminated in 7 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads , leaving the ends of the ships unprotected . The transverse bulkheads of the waterline belt in Pobeda were eliminated as the belt was extended to the ends of the ship with 4 @-@ inch armor plates . Above the waterline belt in all three ships was a shorter strake of armor that protected the middle of the ships . It was 188 feet ( 57 @.@ 3 m ) long and 4 inches thick . The ends of the upper belt were closed off by 4 @-@ inch angled transverse bulkheads . 
 The sides of the gun turrets were 9 inches thick and 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) of armor protected their roofs ; their supporting tubes were 8 inches ( 203 mm ) thick . The face of the casemates for the 6 @-@ inch guns was five inches thick and their rears were protected by 2 @-@ inch ( 51 mm ) armor plates . The casemates at each end of the ships were protected by 5 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads . Bulkheads 0 @.@ 75 inches ( 19 mm ) thick separated the 75 @-@ millimeter gun positions . Peresvet had two conning towers , each with sides 6 inches thick , but the other two ships only had a forward conning tower with 9 @-@ inch sides . A communications tube 3 inches thick connected each conning tower to the armored deck in all three ships . The flat part of the deck in the central armored citadel consisted of a 1 @.@ 46 @-@ inch ( 37 mm ) plate over the normal 0 @.@ 75 @-@ inch structural steel deck plate ; the sloped portion connected to the lower edge of the waterline belt and was 2 @.@ 5 inches thick . Outside the citadel the armored deck consisted of 2 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 57 mm ) plates laid over the 1 inch ( 25 mm ) deck plating . On the first two ships the deck armor consisted of mild steel ; in Pobeda it was a chrome @-@ nickel steel alloy .

 Peresvet , named after Alexander Peresvet , a Russian monk who fought at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380 , and Pobeda ( Victory ) were sent to the Far East almost immediately after entering service in 1901 and 1903 respectively . Peresvet became flagship of the squadron 's second @-@ in @-@ command , Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky , upon her arrival . During the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war , Peresvet was not hit , but Pobeda was hit once amidships , sustaining little damage but losing two men killed and four wounded . The latter struck a mine during the squadron 's sortie on 13 April and she was under repair for almost two months . Both ships had some of their anti @-@ torpedo boat guns and secondary armament removed during the summer to bolster the defenses of the port . They participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August ; Pobeda was only lightly damaged by 11 large @-@ caliber hits , but Peresvet was hit 39 times and suffered a considerable amount of flooding . More guns were landed after the squadron 's return to Port Arthur , but the Imperial Japanese Army captured the hills overlooking the harbor in November and they allowed the Army 's 28 @-@ centimeter ( 11 in ) siege guns to fire directly at the Russian ships . Pobeda and Peresvet were hit many times and Pobeda sank on 7 December 1904 from the accumulated damage . Peresvet was scuttled in shallow water on that same day . 
 Construction of Oslyabya , named after Radion Oslyabya , another monk who fought at the Battle of Kulikovo , was greatly delayed , and the ship was en route to the Far East when the Russo @-@ Japanese War began in February 1904 . She was ordered home and assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron that was intended to relieve the forces in Port Arthur . The ship served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Baron Dmitry von Fölkersam , second @-@ in @-@ command of the squadron , but he died two days before the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905 . Oslyabya led the Second Division of the squadron during the battle and was the target of numerous Japanese ships during the early part of the battle . Many of the hits on the ship were along the waterline and caused extensive flooding . Efforts to counteract the resulting list destroyed her remaining stability and she sank just over an hour after the Japanese opened fire , the first modern battleship to be sunk solely by gunfire . Sources differ on the exact number of casualties , but the lowest figure given is 471 . 
 = = = In Japanese service = = = 
 Peresvet and Pobeda were raised , repaired , and rearmed by the Japanese . They were incorporated into the Imperial Japanese Navy as Sagami and Suwo , respectively , and reclassified as first @-@ class coastal defense ships . After the beginning of World War I , Sagami was sold to Russia in March 1916 and arrived in Vladivostok on 3 April 1916 , where she resumed her former name of Peresvet . The ship was intended to serve with the Russian Arctic flotilla and was en route to the Arctic when she struck two mines off Port Said , Egypt on 4 January 1917 . The mines had been laid by the German submarine SM U @-@ 73 and Peresvet sank with the loss of 167 lives after catching fire . 
 During World War I , Suwo served as the flagship for the Japanese squadron during the Battle of Tsingtao from 27 August to 7 November 1914 . The ship served as flagship of the Second Squadron of the Second Fleet in 1915 – 16 before becoming a gunnery training ship for the rest of the war . In April 1922 , in compliance with the Washington Naval Treaty , Suwo was disarmed at the Kure Naval Arsenal . While her armor was being removed , the ship capsized on 13 July . She was probably scrapped in 1922 – 23 , but at least one source suggests she was refloated and hulked , serving until being broken up at Kure in 1946 .

 Air Marshal Sir Colin Thomas Hannah , KCMG , KCVO , KBE , CB ( 22 December 1914 – 22 May 1978 ) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) and a Governor of Queensland . Born in Western Australia , he was a member of the Militia before joining the RAAF in 1935 . After graduating as a pilot , Hannah served in Nos. 22 and 23 Squadrons from 1936 to 1939 . During the early years of World War II , he was the RAAF 's Deputy Director of Armament . He then saw action in the South West Pacific as commander of No. 6 Squadron and , later , No. 71 Wing , operating Bristol Beaufort bombers . By 1944 , he had risen to the rank of group captain , and at the end of the war was in charge of Western Area Command in Perth . 
 Hannah commanded RAAF Station Amberley , Queensland , in 1949 – 50 , and saw service during the Malayan Emergency as senior air staff officer at RAF Far East Air Force Headquarters , Singapore , from 1956 to 1959 . His other post @-@ war appointments included Deputy Chief of the Air Staff from 1961 to 1965 , Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) Operational Command from 1965 to 1967 , and AOC Support Command from 1968 to 1969 . In January 1970 , he was promoted to air marshal and became Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) , the RAAF 's senior position . Knighted in 1971 , Hannah concluded his three @-@ year appointment as CAS a year early , in March 1972 , to become Governor of Queensland . He attracted controversy in this role after making comments critical of the Federal government of the day , and the British government refused to agree to his term being extended . Hannah retired in March 1977 , and died the following year . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Born on 22 December 1914 in Menzies , Western Australia , Hannah was the son of Thomas Howard Hannah , a public servant who later became a magistrate in Perth , and his wife Johanna . Hannah attended the Hale School , leaving with a Junior Certificate in 1930 . He served with an Australian Militia unit , the 8th Field Artillery Brigade , from February 1933 , and became a clerk in the Crown Law Department of the State Public Service later that year . 
 Hannah joined the Royal Australian Air Force on 15 January 1935 as an air cadet at RAAF Station Point Cook , Victoria . After graduating from No. 1 Flying Training School ( No. 1 FTS ) , he obtained his commission as a pilot officer in July 1936 . His first posting was to No. 22 Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond , New South Wales . Promoted to flying officer , he was appointed adjutant with the newly formed No. 23 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , in May 1937 . Hannah accompanied the squadron , which operated Hawker Demons and Avro Ansons , to its new location at the recently opened RAAF Station Pearce , Western Australia , in March 1938 . On 5 January 1939 , he married Patricia Gordon at Claremont ; the couple had a daughter . Having specialised as an instructor , he then served on the staff of No. 1 FTS , Point Cook . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Promoted to flight lieutenant , Hannah was posted to Britain in July 1939 to undertake a Royal Air Force armaments training course , which he had barely begun when war was declared on 3 September . He completed the course , and returned to Australia in March 1940 . After brief postings to No. 1 Armament School , Point Cook , and Station Headquarters Laverton , he was assigned to Air Force Headquarters , Melbourne , in May . He was made an acting squadron leader in September 1940 and became Deputy Director of Armament the next year . In April 1942 , Hannah was promoted to temporary wing commander . He undertook a general reconnaissance course the following May . 
 In November 1943 , Hannah was appointed commanding officer of No. 6 Squadron at Milne Bay , Papua , flying Bristol Beaufort light bombers . During a familiarisation flight he came under friendly fire from anti @-@ aircraft guns on Kiriwina Island , but avoided serious injury . He was raised to temporary group captain in December , and assumed command of No. 71 Wing the following month . The Beauforts of No. 6 Squadron and No. 71 Wing took part in a series of major attacks on Rabaul , bombing and strafing airfields , infrastructure and shipping ; this continued until February 1944 , when the Japanese withdrew their aircraft from Rabaul . The same month , Hannah fell ill and had to be repatriated to Australia . After six weeks recuperation at Laverton , he returned to No. 6 Squadron , based on Goodenough Island . From March to August , the squadron was mainly involved in convoy escort and anti @-@ submarine duties . In September 1944 , Hannah was appointed senior air staff officer ( SASO ) at Headquarters Western Area Command , Perth . He took over control of the formation from Air Commodore Raymond Brownell in July 1945 , following Brownell 's departure to command No. 11 Group in the Dutch East Indies .

 Hannah handed over command of Western Area in October 1946 , and was posted to Britain . Over the next two years , he undertook study at RAF Staff College , Andover , and served as SASO at RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London . Returning to Australia , in May 1949 he assumed command of RAAF Station Amberley , Queensland . From August 1950 , he also held temporary command of the base 's Avro Lincoln heavy bomber formation , No. 82 Wing . Promoted to substantive group captain in October 1950 , Hannah was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) in the 1951 New Year Honours , in particular for his " exceptional ability " as SASO at RAAF Overseas Headquarters . In September that year , he was made Director of Personnel Services ; his position became Director @-@ General of Personnel in July 1952 . As aide @-@ de @-@ camp to Queen Elizabeth II , Hannah was heavily involved in planning the RAAF 's part in the 1954 Royal Tour of Australia . He was raised to Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the Queen 's Birthday Honours that June . 
 In 1955 , Hannah attended the Imperial Defence College in London , and was promoted to air commodore . He was posted to Singapore as SASO , RAF Far East Air Force Headquarters , in January 1956 , handling counter @-@ insurgency operations during the Malayan Emergency . Hannah 's " distinguished service " during the conflict was recognised with his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath ( CB ) in June 1959 . As Director @-@ General of Plans and Policy from March 1959 , he was responsible for commencing the Department of Air 's relocation from Melbourne to Canberra . In December 1961 , Hannah was appointed Deputy Chief of the Air Staff , receiving promotion to acting air vice marshal in May 1962 ; the rank was made substantive in January 1963 . He was later described by his staff officer in this role as " brusque " and " impersonal " though not unsympathetic , his " uncommunicative " manner stemming from a preference to " do his own research , think out the substance of his project submissions , dictate to his stenographer , then amend to his own satisfaction " , rather than delegate . Hannah served as Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) Operational Command ( now Air Command ) from February 1965 to December 1967 , during which time the RAAF 's fighter squadrons completed their conversion from the CAC Sabre to the supersonic Dassault Mirage III . His tenure also saw the deployment of the first Australian helicopters to Vietnam , eight UH @-@ 1 Iroquois of No. 9 Squadron that departed Sydney in May 1966 . Hannah 's next appointment was as AOC Support Command , responsible for training and maintenance in the Air Force . Throughout his career to this point he was noted for his energy and drive . 
 = = = Chief of the Air Staff = = = 
 Hannah was promoted to air marshal on 1 January 1970 , and succeeded Air Marshal Sir Alister Murdoch as Chief of the Air Staff . Murdoch had earlier recommended Hannah , known to be a strong advocate for Australian participation in the Vietnam War , for the position of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam when it came up for rotation at the end of 1969 ; the post went to an Army officer , and the Federal government ordered the withdrawal of the RAAF presence in Vietnam during Hannah 's tour as CAS . In March 1970 , the Minister for Defence , Malcolm Fraser , commissioned a review of naval air power . Hannah fundamentally disagreed with any suggestion that the Royal Australian Navy should operate land @-@ based aircraft , claiming that he was arguing not from a partisan perspective but to ensure that Australia 's limited defence resources were not spread across three services . Confidential RAAF papers from the time declared that its goal was always to " avoid giving the Navy the opportunity to establish a land @-@ based air force " . Two years later , Hannah responded favourably to a recommendation from the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee , Admiral Sir Victor Smith , to use the soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ delivered F @-@ 111 bomber for maritime support , among other roles . 
 In the 1971 New Year Honours , Hannah was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( KBE ) . His tour as CAS coincided with the RAAF 's Golden Jubilee , celebrated in March and April that year . He personally organised a fly @-@ past of two US Air Force F @-@ 111s at air shows marking the occasion , generating favourable coverage to counteract the poor publicity surrounding the type 's long @-@ delayed entry into Australian service . He was also involved in two controversial decisions the same year . Firstly , he was a member of the committee to choose an Air Force memorial to be located on ANZAC Parade , Canberra . The selected design was an abstract sculpture that , according to official RAAF historian Alan Stephens , reflected " the selection panel 's comprehensive failure to understand the nature of air force service " . Secondly , Hannah commissioned a replacement for the Air Force 's winter uniform , traditionally a shade " somewhere between royal and navy blue " that had been personally chosen by the RAAF 's first CAS , Wing Commander ( later Air Marshal Sir ) Richard Williams , to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force colour . Hannah publicly debuted the uniform that he approved , an all @-@ purpose middle @-@ blue suit , at a Point Cook graduation parade on 8 December 1971 . It was the object of much adverse comment in the ensuing years ; personnel complained of being mistaken for bus , train and postal employees . One of Hannah 's successors as CAS , Air Marshal Errol McCormack , ordered that the uniform revert to Williams ' original colour and style commencing in 2000 . 
 = = Governor = = 
 Hannah 's planned three @-@ year term as Chief of the Air Staff was cut short by some ten months when he accepted an offer to serve as Governor of Queensland , becoming the first officer in the RAAF to receive a vice @-@ regal appointment . The announcement was made in January 1972 , and he took office on 21 March . He succeeded Sir Alan Mansfield . Hannah did not have a strong connection with Queensland at the time of his appointment , and had only lived in the state during his period as commander of RAAF Station Amberley between 1949 and 1951 . He claimed not to have actively sought the governorship , and was criticised for failing to consult with senior colleagues before making his decision to retire early from his position as head of the Air Force . He was replaced as CAS by his deputy , Air Vice Marshal ( later Air Marshal Sir ) Charles Read . 
 Described when he took office as " a man with the flexibility of mind and ability to mix with people , so necessary for a Governor " , Hannah was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George ( KCMG ) and a Knight and Deputy Prior of the Venerable Order of Saint John in September 1972 . His term as Governor was relatively uneventful until 1975 . In October that year , he created controversy at a Brisbane Chamber of Commerce luncheon by criticising the " fumbling ineptitude " of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam 's Federal Labor government for placing Australia in " its present economic state " . Vice @-@ regal appointees in Australia were expected to remain above politics , but Hannah declared that he would be " guilty of sheltering behind convention , of denying my heritage and failing in my regard for the people of Queensland " if he did not speak his mind . The incident occurred in the midst of a constitutional crisis and , according to military historian Chris Coulthard @-@ Clark , was " widely seen as a blatant intervention in the national political arena " . The Federal government responded by advising the Queen to revoke Hannah 's dormant commission to serve in place of the Governor @-@ General if required ; at the time Hannah was the second in line to serve as Governor @-@ General , after the Governor of New South Wales . Following his succession in November 1975 , Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser attempted to have the dormant commission reinstated , but the British government refused to recommend this to the Queen , citing lack of impartiality on Hannah 's part . Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke @-@ Petersen made it known that he planned to extend the Governor 's term , but the British government also refused to agree to this . Bjelke @-@ Petersen was prepared to pursue the matter , but Hannah declined to let his name be put forward again . 
 On 9 October 1976 , Hannah dedicated a memorial at Cairns to commemorate the crews of RAAF Catalina flying boats who lost their lives in the South West Pacific during World War II . His vice @-@ regal appointment lapsed on 20 March 1977 , and he was succeeded the next month by Commodore Sir James Ramsay . 
 = = Retirement and death = = 
 Hannah retired following completion of his term as Governor of Queensland . He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order ( KCVO ) in August 1977 ( backdated to March ) as part of Queen Elizabeth II 's Silver Jubilee visit to Australia . Hannah died of a heart attack on 22 May 1978 at his home in Surfers Paradise , Queensland . He was given a state funeral and cremated ; his wife and daughter survived him . Hannah Community Park , straddling the suburbs of Fadden and Gowrie in Canberra , was established in his honour in 2002 . 
 = Belgrade = 
 Belgrade ( / <unk> / ; Serbian : Beograd / <unk> ; Serbian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ; names in other languages ) is the capital and largest city of Serbia . It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers , where the Pannonian Plain meets the Balkans . Its name translates to " White city " . The city proper has a population of 1 @.@ 23 million , while over 1 @.@ 65 million people live within the administrative limits . 
 One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe , the Vinča culture , evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC . In antiquity , Thraco @-@ Dacians inhabited the region , and after 279 BC Celts conquered the city , naming it <unk> . It was conquered by the Romans during the reign of Augustus , and awarded city rights in the mid @-@ 2nd century . It was settled by the Slavs in the <unk> , and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire , Frankish Empire , Bulgarian Empire and Kingdom of Hungary before it became the capital of Serbian king Stephen Dragutin ( 1282 – 1316 ) . In 1521 , Belgrade was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo . It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule , which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro @-@ Ottoman wars . Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841 . Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918 , when the city was reunited . As a strategic location , the city was battled over in 115 wars and razed to the ground 44 times . Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia ( in various forms of governments ) from its creation in 1918 , to its final dissolution in 2006 . 
 Belgrade has a special administrative status within Serbia and it is one of five statistical regions of Serbia . Its metropolitan territory is divided into 17 municipalities , each with its own local council . It covers 3 @.@ 6 % of Serbia 's territory , and 22 @.@ 5 % of the country 's population lives in the city . Belgrade has been awarded many titles , and is classified as a Beta- global city . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Belgrade lies 116 @.@ 75 metres ( 383 @.@ 0 ft ) above sea level and is located at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers . The historical core of Belgrade , Kalemegdan , lies on the right banks of both rivers . Since the 19th century , the city has been expanding to the south and east ; after World War II , Novi Beograd ( New Belgrade ) was built on the left bank of the Sava river , connecting Belgrade with Zemun . Smaller , chiefly residential communities across the Danube , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , also merged with the city , while Pančevo , a heavily industrialized satellite city , remains a separate town . The city has an urban area of 360 square kilometres ( 140 sq mi ) , while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3 @,@ 223 km2 ( 1 @,@ 244 sq mi ) . Throughout history , Belgrade has been a crossroads between the West and the Orient . 
 On the right bank of the Sava , central Belgrade has a hilly terrain , while the highest point of Belgrade proper is <unk> hill at 303 m ( 994 ft ) . The mountains of Avala ( 511 m ( 1 @,@ 677 ft ) ) and <unk> ( 628 m ( 2 @,@ 060 ft ) ) lie south of the city . Across the Sava and Danube , the land is mostly flat , consisting of alluvial plains and <unk> plateaus . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Belgrade lies in the humid subtropical ( Cfa ) climate zone , with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation . Monthly averages range from 1 @.@ 4 ° C ( 34 @.@ 5 ° F ) in January to 23 @.@ 0 ° C ( 73 @.@ 4 ° F ) in July , with an annual mean of 12 @.@ 5 ° C ( 54 @.@ 5 ° F ) . There are , on average , 31 days a year when the temperature is above 30 ° C , and 95 days when the temperature is above 25 ° C. Belgrade receives about 690 millimetres ( 27 in ) of precipitation a year , with late spring being wettest . The average annual number of sunny hours is 2 @,@ 112 . 
 The highest officially recorded temperature in Belgrade was + 43 @.@ 6 ° C ( 110 @.@ 5 ° F ) on 24 July 2007 , while on the other end , the lowest temperature was − 26 @.@ 2 ° C ( − 15 ° F ) on 10 January 1893 .

 Chipped stone tools found at Zemun show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras . Some of these tools belong to the Mousterian industry , which are associated with Neanderthals rather than modern humans . Aurignacian and <unk> tools have also been discovered there , indicating occupation between 50 @,@ 000 and 20 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 The first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the Neolithic Starčevo culture , which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC . There are several Starčevo sites in and around Belgrade , including the eponymous site of Starčevo . The Starčevo culture was succeeded by the Vinča culture ( 5500 – 4500 BC ) , a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Starčevo settlements which is also named for a site in the Belgrade region ( Vinča @-@ Belo Brdo ) . The Vinča culture is known for its very large settlements , one of the earliest settlements by continuous habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe ; anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vinča ; the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe ; a proto @-@ writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans , known as the Old European script , dating back to around 5300 BC .

 Evidence of early knowledge about Belgrade 's geographical location comes from ancient myths and legends . The rock overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers has been identified as one of the place in the story of Jason and the Argonauts . The Paleo @-@ Balkan tribes of Thracians and Dacians ruled this area prior to the Roman conquest . Belgrade was inhabited by a Thraco @-@ Dacian tribe <unk> ; after the Celtic invasion in 279 BC , the <unk> took the city , naming it " <unk> " ( <unk> , fortress ) . In 34 – 33 BC the Roman army led by Silanus reached Belgrade . It became the romanized Singidunum in the 1st century AD , and by the mid @-@ 2nd century , the city was proclaimed a municipium by the Roman authorities , evolving into a full @-@ fledged colonia ( highest city class ) by the end of the century . Apart from the first Christian Emperor of Rome who was born in the territory of modern Serbia in Naissus — Constantine I known as Constantine the Great — another early Roman Emperor was born in Singidunum : Flavius <unk> ( Jovian ) , the restorer of Christianity . Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire , ending the brief revival of traditional Roman religions under his predecessor Julian the Apostate . In 395 AD , the site passed to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire . Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of <unk> ( Zemun ) ; the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times .

 In 442 , the area was ravaged by Attila the Hun . In 471 , it was taken by Theodoric the Great , who continued into Greece . As the Ostrogoths left for Italy , the Gepids took over the city . In 539 it was retaken by the Byzantines . In 577 , some 100 @,@ 000 Slavs poured into Thrace and Illyricum , pillaging cities and settling down . The Avars under Bayan I conquered the whole region by 582 . According to Byzantine chronicle De Administrando Imperio , the White Serbs had stopped in Belgrade on their way back home , asking the strategos for lands ; they received provinces in the west , towards the Adriatic , which they would rule as subjects to Heraclius ( 610 – 641 ) . In 829 Khan Omurtag was able to add Singidunum and its environs to the First Bulgarian Empire . 
 The first record of the name <unk> appeared on April , 16th , 878 , in a Papal letter to Bulgarian ruler Boris I. Later , this name appeared in several variants : Alba Graeca ( Greek city ) , <unk> <unk> ( Greek white castle ) , <unk> Alba ( City of the Bulgarians ) , <unk> <unk> ( The white castle of the Bulgarians ) - still named like this in the Hungarian <unk> of the city , <unk> ( White Castle ) , Alba <unk> ( Bulgarian City ) . For about four centuries , the city remained a battleground between the Byzantine Empire , the Kingdom of Hungary and the Bulgarian Empire . Basil II ( 976 – 1025 ) installed a garrison in Belgrade . The city hosted the armies of the First and the Second Crusade ; while passing through during the Third Crusade , Frederick Barbarossa and his 190 @,@ 000 crusaders saw Belgrade in ruins . 
 Stefan Dragutin ( r . 1276 – 1282 ) received Belgrade from his father @-@ in @-@ law , Stephen V of Hungary in 1284 ; it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Syrmia , and Dragutin is regarded as the first Serbian king to rule over Belgrade as a vassal to the Kingdom of Hungary . 
 Following the battles at Maritsa ( 1371 ) and Kosovo field ( 1389 ) , Serbia began to crumble as the Ottoman Empire conquered its southern territory . The north resisted through the Serbian Despotate , which had Belgrade as its capital . The city flourished under Stefan Lazarević , son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanović . Lazarević built a castle with a citadel and towers , of which only the Despot 's tower and west wall remain . He also refortified the city 's ancient walls , allowing the Despotate to resist the Ottomans for almost 70 years . During this time , Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule , and is thought to have had a population of 40 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 people . 
 In 1427 , Stefan 's successor Đurađ Branković had to return Belgrade to the Hungarian king , and Smederevo became the new capital . Although the Ottomans captured most of the Serbian Despotate , Belgrade , known as <unk> in Hungarian , was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440 and 1456 . As the city presented an obstacle to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further , over 100 @,@ 000 Ottoman soldiers besieged it in 1456 , in which the Christian army successfully defended it . The noon bell ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day . 
 = = = Ottoman conquest and Austrian invasions = = = 
 Seven decades after the initial siege , on 28 August 1521 , the fort was finally captured by Ottoman Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent and his 250 @,@ 000 soldiers ; subsequently , most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to Istanbul , to an area that has since become known as the Belgrade forest . Belgrade was made the seat of the district ( Sanjak ) , becoming the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100 @,@ 000 people , surpassed only by Constantinople . Ottoman rule also introduced Ottoman architecture , including numerous mosques , increasing the city 's Oriental influences . In 1594 , a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans . Later , Grand vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the <unk> plateau ; in the 20th century , the Temple of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event . 
 Occupied by the Habsburgs three times ( 1688 – 1690 , 1717 – 1739 , 1789 – 1791 ) , headed by the Holy Roman Princes Maximilian of Bavaria and Eugene of Savoy , and field marshal Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon respectively , Belgrade was quickly recaptured by the Ottomans and substantially razed each time . During this period , the city was affected by the two Great Serbian Migrations , in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs , led by two Serbian Patriarchs , retreated together with the Austrians into the Habsburg Empire , settling in today 's Vojvodina and Slavonia .

 During the First Serbian Uprising , the Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813 , when it was retaken by the Ottomans .

 With the Principality 's full independence in 1878 , and its transformation into the Kingdom of Serbia in 1882 , Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans , and developed rapidly . Nevertheless , conditions in Serbia as a whole remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country , even with the opening of a railway to Niš , Serbia 's second city , and in 1900 the capital had only 70 @,@ 000 inhabitants ( at the time Serbia numbered 1 @.@ 5 million ) . Yet by 1905 the population had grown to more than 80 @,@ 000 , and by the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , it had surpassed the 100 @,@ 000 citizens , not counting Zemun which then belonged to Austria @-@ Hungary .

 On 25 March 1941 , the government of regent Crown Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact , joining the Axis powers in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict . This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d 'état led by Air Force commander General Dušan Simović , who proclaimed King Peter II to be of age to rule the realm . Consequently , the city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1941 , killing up to 24 @,@ 000 people . Yugoslavia was then invaded by German , Italian , Hungarian , and Bulgarian forces . Belgrade was occupied by the German Army later the same month and Belgrade became the seat of the puppet Nedić regime , headed by General Milan Nedić . 
 During the summer and fall of 1941 , in reprisal for guerrilla attacks , the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens ; in particular , members of the Jewish community were subject to mass shootings at the order of General Franz Böhme , the German Military Governor of Serbia . Böhme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed , 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot . The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major Žarko Todorović from 1941 until his arrest in 1943 . 
 Just like Rotterdam , which was devastated twice , by both German and Allied bombing , Belgrade was bombed once more during World War II , this time by the Allies on 16 April 1944 , killing at least 1 @,@ 100 people .

 = = Transportation = = 
 Belgrade has an extensive public transport system based on buses ( 118 urban lines and more than 300 suburban lines ) , trams ( 12 lines ) , and trolleybuses ( 8 lines ) . It is run by GSP Beograd and SP <unk> , in cooperation with private companies on various bus routes . The <unk> ticketing system based on contactless smart cards began operating in February 2012 . Belgrade also has a commuter rail network , Beovoz , now run by the city government . The main railway station connects Belgrade with other European capitals and many towns in Serbia . Travel by coach is also popular , and the capital is well @-@ served with daily connections to every town in Serbia and to many other European destinations through the central bus station . 
 The city is placed along the Pan @-@ European corridors X and VII . The motorway system provides for easy access to Novi Sad and Budapest , in the north ; Niš to the south ; and Zagreb , to the west . Situated at the confluence of two major rivers , the Danube and the Sava , Belgrade has 7 bridges — the two main ones are Branko 's bridge and the <unk> Bridge , both of which connect the core of the city to New Belgrade . With the city 's expansion and a substantial increase in the number of vehicles , congestion has become a major problem ; this is expected to be alleviated by the construction of a bypass connecting the E70 and E75 motorways . Further , an " inner magistral semi @-@ ring " is planned , including a new Ada Bridge across the Sava river , which is expected to ease commuting within the city and unload the <unk> and Branko 's bridge . 
 The Port of Belgrade is on the Danube , and allows the city to receive goods by river . The city is also served by Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport , 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) west of the city centre , near Surčin . At its peak in 1986 , almost 3 million passengers travelled through the airport , though that number dwindled to a trickle in the 1990s . Following renewed growth in 2000 , the number of passengers reached approximately 2 million in 2004 and 2005 , over 2 @.@ 6 million passengers in 2008 , reaching over 3 million passengers . All @-@ time peak , with over 4 million passengers , was accomplished in 2014 , when Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport became the second fastest growing major airport in Europe . 
 Beovoz is the suburban / commuter railway network that provides mass @-@ transit services in the city , similar to Paris ' RER and Toronto 's GO Transit . The main usage of today 's system is to connect the suburbs with the city centre . Beovoz is operated by Serbian Railways . Belgrade suburban railway system connects suburbs and nearby cities to the west , north and south of the city . It began operation in 1992 and currently has 5 lines with 41 stations divided in two zones . 
 Belgrade was one of the last big European capitals and cities with over a million people to have no metro / subway or other rapid transit system . The Belgrade Metro is considered the third most important project in the country , after work on roads and railways . The two projects of highest priority are the Belgrade bypass and the Pan @-@ European Corridor X.

 = Iowa Highway 85 = 
 Iowa Highway 85 ( Iowa 85 ) is a short state highway in east @-@ central Iowa . The route begins at the eastern city limit of Montezuma and ends at Iowa 21 east of Deep River . Created in 1920 as a spur route connecting What Cheer to Primary Road No. 2 , it is an original route in the Iowa primary highway system . In the early 1930s , the route was extended north to Deep River and west to Montezuma . By the end of the decade , Iowa 21 had taken over the north – south portion of the route . Except for both endpoints shifting slightly , Iowa 85 has largely stayed the same since the 1930s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Iowa 85 begins at the eastern city limit of Montezuma . It heads east through the rolling farmland of <unk> County . Near the midpoint of the route , it intersects County Road V18 ( CR V18 ) . As it approaches Deep River , the route briefly curves to the north @-@ northeast before turning to the southeast . The terrain becomes hillier as the route crosses a creek leading to the eponymous river just north of Deep River . On the south side of Deep River , Iowa 85 turns back to the east . It ends one @-@ half mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) east of Deep River at an intersection with Iowa 21 . 
 = = History = = 
 Primary Road No. 85 was created in 1920 with the advent of Iowa 's primary highway system . At the time , it was a short spur route connecting What Cheer to Primary Road No. 2 in Keokuk County . In 1931 , Iowa 85 was significantly lengthened north to Deep River and west to US 63 in Montezuma . In 1939 , the route was shortened to its east – west section between Montezuma and Deep River as Iowa 21 was extended and it supplanted Iowa 85 south of Deep River . 
 Iowa 85 was paved in the mid @-@ 1950s ; until then , the highway had been a gravel road . In the early 1960s , Iowa 21 was straightened through Keokuk County near Guernsey and Deep River . This caused the eastern end of Iowa 85 to move east back to the point where it had turned into an east – west route in the 1930s . The route would remain this way for nearly thirty years . In 1994 , the westernmost one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of Iowa 85 was turned over to the City of Montezuma . The route now begins at the eastern city limits . Along US 63 , signs at the former intersection of Iowa 85 now say " To Iowa 85 " .

 = Malouma = 
 Malouma Mint El Meidah ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> <unk> , also simply <unk> or Malouma ; born October 1 , 1960 ) is a Mauritanian singer , songwriter and politician . Raised in the south @-@ west of the country by parents versed in traditional Mauritanian music , she first performed when she was twelve , soon featuring in solo concerts . Her first song " Habibi Habeytou " harshly criticized the way in which women were treated by their husbands . Though an immediate success , it caused an outcry from the traditional ruling classes . After being forced into marriage while still a teenager , Malouma had to give up singing until 1986 . She developed her own style combining traditional music with blues , jazz , and electro . Appearing on television with songs addressing highly controversial topics such as conjugal life , poverty and inequality , she was censored in Mauritania in the early 1990s but began to perform abroad by the end of the decade . After the ban was finally lifted , she relaunched her singing and recording career , gaining popularity , particularly among the younger generation . Her fourth album , Knou ( 2014 ) , includes lyrics expressing her views on human rights and women 's place in society . 
 Alongside her singing , Malouma has also fought to safeguard her country 's music , urging the government to create a music school , forming her own foundation in support of musical heritage , and in 2014 creating her own music festival . She has also been active in politics since the 1990s , when she began to campaign for more democracy . She was elected a senator in 2007 , the first politician in her caste , but was arrested the following year after a coup d 'état . When elections were again held in 2009 , she became a senator for the opposition <unk> @-@ <unk> party where she was given special responsibilities for the environment . This led in 2011 to her appointment as the IUCN 's Goodwill Ambassador for Central and West Africa . In December 2014 , she announced she was moving from the opposition to join the ruling party , the Union for the Republic , where she felt she could be more effective in contributing to the country 's progress . Her work has been recognized by the French , who decorated her as a Knight of the Legion of Honor , and the Americans , whose ambassador to Mauritania named her a Mauritanian Woman of Courage . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Malouma Mint Moktar Ould Meidah was born in Mederdra in the <unk> Region of south @-@ western Mauritania , on October 1 , 1960 , the year the country gained independence from France . Born into a griot family , she grew up in the small desert village of <unk> , just south of Mederdra in West Africa . Her father , Mokhtar Ould Meidah , was a celebrated singer , <unk> player and poet while her grandfather , Mohamed Yahya Ould <unk> , is remembered as a talented writer and <unk> virtuoso . Her mother also came from a family of well @-@ known traditional singers . She taught her daughter to play the ardin , a ten @-@ stringed harp traditionally played by women , when she was six . 
 Malouma commenced her education at elementary school in 1965 in Mederdra . She qualified as an elementary school teacher in 1974 in Rosso . According to the traditions of her country , those of the Meidah family are required to carry on the art of their ancestors . As a result , she had to give up her aspirations to teach . Members of each caste are allowed only to marry other members of society within the same caste and the entire society is divided by castes politically , economically , and culturally . Movement outside of a particular caste is forbidden . She learned to play the traditional stringed instruments only women play , especially the ardin harp , and was taught traditional Mauritanian music by her father , who enjoyed an eclectic mix of music . As a result , she grew up listening to classical western works such as Beethoven , Chopin , Mozart , Vivaldi and Wagner , as well as the music of traditional Berber , Egyptian , Lebanese and Senegalese artists . She often accompanied her parents who sang traditional griots . 
 Malouma began singing as a child , first performed on the stage when she was twelve and began appearing in solo concerts with a traditional repertoire by age fifteen . In addition to her father 's guidance , she was inspired by other traditional artists including Oum <unk> , Abdel Halim Hafez , Fairouz , <unk> and Sabah . As she matured , she increasingly became interested in blues music , which appealed to her as it bore a resemblance to the traditional music she knew . Malouma wrote her first song , " Habibi Habeytou " ( My beloved , I loved him ) when she was sixteen . It was a song protesting the tradition of men turning their wives out of their homes to marry younger women . It brought her instant recognition , but created a backlash , causing physical attacks from the established Muslim community . Soon after she wrote it , her family moved to Nouakchott , the capital , to help her launch her music career , but in the strongly traditional society , Malouma was forced to marry , abandoning singing until the late 1980s . She was later accused by her father of ruining his reputation . In addition to the criticisms stemming from her songs , she had disgraced her family by divorcing twice : her first husband had been forced upon her , while the second came from a noble family , who would not allow her to sing . Yet after hearing one of her songs , her father commented : " You have created something new and I find it touching . Unfortunately , I will not live long enough to be able to protect you . " 
 = = Music career = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Malouma 's first major appearance was in 1986 , when she revealed her fusion style , combining traditional interpretations with more modern developments including blues , jazz , and electro . Her early songs " Habibi <unk> " , " <unk> <unk> <unk> " and " <unk> <unk> " , which openly addressed love , conjugal life and the inequalities between men and women , contrasted strongly with what was considered acceptable in her home country . Nevertheless , they had strong popular appeal , especially for young women . Malouma carefully developed her approach , blending traditional themes with the rich repertoire and instrumentation of modern popular music . Typically , her compositions are based on the traditions of classical Arab poets , such as Al @-@ Mutanabbi and <unk> ibn Shaddad , whose verses cover political criticism , personal sacrifice and support for the weak and oppressed . She has also drawn on traditional Mauritanian themes , modernizing both the lyrics and musical presentation . 
 From the beginning , Malouma sang in a variety of languages , including traditional Arabic , <unk> ( Mauritanian Arabic ) , French and Wolof . By singing in various languages , she sought to air her message to a broader audience . It was not long before she appeared on television together with her sister , <unk> , and her brother , Arafat , an instrumentalist . Their style was controversial , especially after the release of her song " Habibi Habeytou " and a 1988 appearance at the Carthage Festival in Tunis , as she addressed social issues , such as poverty , inequality and disease which were not generally acceptable in Mauritania . Her participation in the Carthage event led to her subsequent appearance on Arab satellite channels , giving her greater exposure . Malouma became nationally known and was a sought after performer until a 1991 song about freedom of speech . After being censored for writing songs promoting women 's rights and challenging apartheid , she was banned from appearing on television and radio , holding concerts , and was even denied a permanent address . She did not perform anywhere for a lengthy period but in the late 1990s she began to sing in other African countries , in Europe , and in the United States . While she won audiences among the people , Malouma was persecuted by both the moral authorities and authoritarian governments , her music being completely banned until 2003 when a crowd of 10 @,@ 000 successfully called on President Ould Taya to cancel her censorship . Some restrictions still remained until the overthrow of the Ould Taya regime in 2005 . 
 The traditional griots are songs of praise , but Malouma used her voice to speak out against child marriages , racial and ethnic discrimination , slavery and other divisive issues facing a country at the crossroads of the Arab world and Africa . She also sang about illiteracy , HIV / AIDS awareness and in support of children 's vaccinations . 
 = = = Albums and bands = = = 
 Malouma 's first album , Desert of Eden was released by <unk> Records in 1998 . When it was produced , she felt that the traditional elements were taken out during production , resulting in " bland electronic pop " , though it received good reviews from JazzTimes . In the early 2000s , she began working with a group called the Sahel <unk> Blues made up of ten young Mauritian musicians of different ethnic origins ( Moor , Fula , <unk> , <unk> , Wolof and <unk> ) , demonstrating her desire to overcome racial differences . In so doing , she was also able to extend music based on the traditional string instruments of the Moors to include the beat of the djembe , the <unk> , and the <unk> frame drum . Led by <unk> Ould Meidah , the group supported her desire to modernize traditional music , making it more accessible to the wider world . They toured with her in 2004 and 2005 and worked with her on her second album , Dunya ( Life ) , which sought to reclaim her musical heritage . Produced by Marabi Records in 2003 , the album contained twelve songs which blended harps , lutes and skin drums with electric guitar and bass , and traditional genres like <unk> , which usually focuses on a single minor chord , with jazz . 
 Malouma 's album , Nour ( Light ) , was released in France on 8 March 2007 in celebration of International Women 's Day . Produced by Marabi / Harmonia Mundi , it featured a broad mix of music from lullabies to dance music . Malouma 's singing was supported by a group of fifteen studio musicians on a variety of electronic and traditional instruments . Reviews were mixed , but the CD ranked as number 14 on the World Music Charts Europe by September 2007 . After a hiatus from music to focus on politics , Malouma relaunched her musical career on October 5 , 2014 . Dressed in a blue toga , she presented her new album , Knou , at a special event , appearing on stage for the first time since her election seven years earlier . She chose to call it " Knou " , which is the name of a dance usually performed by women in western Mauritania . The album focused on traditional dancing melodies , but bridged generations by adding modern twists . Weaving jazz , rock and reggae rhythms , into the traditional songs , it was well received . 
 = = = Music festivals = = = 
 Music festival appearances have been a large part of Malouma 's career . The first time she participated in an international festival was in Carthage , Tunisia in 1988 ; her performance proved to be highly successful . Malouma returned to the stage in August 2003 , appearing at the Festival des Musiques Métisses in Angoulême , France , combining traditional Moorish music with a more modern approach in numbers from her album Dunya . She was not only selected as " artiste de l 'année " ( artist of the year ) but was nicknamed " Diva des <unk> " ( Diva of the Sands ) . Her success continued in October of the same year at the World Music Expo in Seville , Spain , where she was selected by the jury as a featured performer . One of the highlights of Angoulême 's Festival des Musiques Métisses was her nostalgic rendering of " <unk> " . The song proved equally popular in Mauritania at the 2004 Nouakchott Festival of Nomadic Music . She was finally permitted to take part after her ban had been lifted . She appeared there with another female Mauritanian star , <unk> Mint Abba , and was accompanied by the French pianist Jean @-@ Philippe <unk> on a synthesizer . 
 Malouma toured in the United States in 2005 with appearances in Ann Arbor , Michigan , Chicago , Illinois , Boston and Cambridge , Massachusetts , Lafayette , Louisiana ( for the Festival International de Louisiane ) , before finishing in New York City . Two years later , Malouma participated in the 32nd Paléo Festival in Nyon , Switzerland , which focused on musicians from North Africa . She also appeared in the 2010 edition of the Førde International Folk Music Festival , held in Førde , Norway under the theme of " freedom and oppression " . At the 2012 Festival International des Arts de l ’ Ahaggar in <unk> , Algeria , she was chosen as one of the three artists to perform in the grand finale , receiving acclaim for the balance of instrumentals and vocals , the composition , and her two back @-@ up vocalists . Her 2013 performance at the World of Music , Arts and Dance Festival ( WOMAD ) , held in Wiltshire , England included a " Taste The World " event where performers not only sang , but prepared a dish from their country . Malouma 's lamb @-@ filled pancakes were a highlight of the festival presenting an up @-@ front and personal encounter with the musician for the audience . Her second stage appearance at the event also brought praise for her rock @-@ star performance embracing modern music . In 2014 , Malouma participated in the Meeting of the Arts of the Arab World , a festival in Montpellier , France , as well as at the Parisian Festival Rhizomes . 
 = = Politics = = 
 Malouma , officially Malouma Meidah , first became politically active as a member of the opposition party in 1992 , speaking out against dictatorships and in favor of democratization . In 2007 , in what was widely considered the first freely held and fair election in the country , she was elected to the Senate of Mauritania , as one of the six women senators in a legislature of 56 members . She was the first person from the musician <unk> caste to serve in politics . Shortly after she was elected , a coup d 'état took place in Mauritania in 2008 and deposed the first democratically @-@ elected head of state , Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh <unk> . Because she had written songs criticizing the coup , Malouma was arrested and over a thousand cassettes and CDs of her recordings were seized . After the coup , the leader , Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz , allowed elections to proceed with only minor delays . He was elected president in July 2009 and the Senate elections in which one @-@ third of the members faced re @-@ election also were held . The parliamentary opposition group , called " <unk> @-@ <unk> " , of which Malouma was a member and served as the First Secretary , constituted 12 members of the 56 @-@ member Senate after the 2009 election . She also served on the Parliamentary Group for the Environment and as 2nd Secretary of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Defence and Armed Forces . 
 Malouma announced in April 2014 that she no longer felt she could keep up her political fight for democracy , although she would continue to support cultural and environmental causes . Even so , her Knou lyrics included allusions to her favorite political causes : equality and rights for all , women 's place in society , and education for the young , all under threat , as well as environmental protection . Referring to her political role as a senator for the opposition party Assembly of Democratic Forces , in August 2014 she commented : " I use my presence and speaking time in the chamber to extend the effect of my texts and my songs . Whenever I run into ministers or important personalities , I tell them what the people expect of them . " She has also continued to speak out about issues such as Palestine and the Iraqi War in her songs . At a press conference on December 16 , 2014 , Malouma announced she was leaving the opposition and joining the ruling party , the Union for the Republic , on the grounds that she could participate more effectively in building Mauritania by standing behind the policies of the current leader Aziz . 
 = = Environment and culture = = 
 In addition to her work in her music career and political activism , Malouma is involved in both environmental protection and cultural preservation projects . 
 = = = Environmental activism = = = 
 Malouma <unk> was involved in a project in 2009 , to relocate 9 @,@ 000 slum @-@ dwelling families from the outskirts of the city into inner city neighborhoods . She insisted that for health reasons , improvements would first have to be made to the infrastructure . In August 2011 , the International Union for Conservation of Nature appointed Malouma as Goodwill Ambassador for Central and West Africa . The position required her to raise awareness of environmental problems with a view to introducing sustainable solutions . On her appointment she commented : " I am delighted at the confidence that IUCN just placed in me . I am deeply honored . I will do my best to fulfill this great responsibility . " In September 2012 , she performed in a concert given during the 2012 IUCN World Conservation Congress held on Jeju Island , South Korea . 
 = = = Cultural preservation = = = 
 As a result of the Mauritanian caste system , the development of traditional music in Mauritania has been supported by just a few families , threatened by a closed culture in which there are limited opportunities for support . As families have no means of preserving their music , or recording it , their creations are often forgotten owing to the absence of family members interested in ensuring their survival . The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the family environment . Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing , in 2006 , Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country 's music heritage , even introducing a measure to Parliament . In 2011 , she created the Malouma Foundation in support of the preservation of the national musical heritage . The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab , African , and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and , to that end , is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve it and make it available for other uses , including education . Long concerned that the Moorish music traditions of her country were being replaced by the Malian and Moroccan music preferred by younger people , in 2014 , she created a Mauritanian Music Festival . 
 When she produced Nour in 2007 , Malouma collaborated with the painter , Sidi <unk> , hoping to create visual images to illustrate the songs in the album . Eleven paintings resulted from the joint venture and Malouma and <unk> presented cultural discussions about their works titled " <unk> la musique , écouter la peinture ? " ( Watch the music , listen to the painting ? ) In 2013 a month @-@ long exhibit was presented to showcase the paintings and the music which inspired them at a gallery in Nouakchott . In 2015 , after receiving a grant from the Arab Culture Fund , Malouma convinced musicians to collaborate with artists when recording their music . The project aimed at collecting music from six artists and producing an album of their works . Malouma has continued to press for the establishment of a music school , though it would require overcoming taboos on family restrictions in regard to musical legacy .

 Malouma was selected in 2003 by the jury as one of the World Music Expo ( <unk> ) showcase artists and two years later she was selected by BBC musicologist Charlie Gillett , for his 2005 selected compilation Favorite Sounds of the World CD . That same year , N 'Diaye Cheikh , a Mauritanian filmmaker , produced a documentary about her , entitled Malouma , diva des sables ( Malouma , Diva of the Sands ) with Mosaic Films , which won Best Documentary at the Festival international du film de <unk> ( <unk> ; Dakar , Senegal ) and a 2007 Prize of Distinction from Festival International de Programmes <unk> ( <unk> ) , held in Biarritz , France . She was a runner @-@ up for the Middle East and North Africa in the 2008 BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music .

 Chico pursued a pre @-@ medical degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana – Champaign , but after his sophomore year he transferred to the University of Illinois at Chicago . A political science major , he volunteered in the 11th Ward . He later secured an externship in the city 's Department of Planning during his senior year , and he worked there from 1977 to 1980 . He received his bachelor 's degree in 1978 . From 1980 to 1987 , he worked for the City Council Finance Committee . Finance Committee chair Alderman Edward M. Burke promoted Chico to research manager , and he became senior research assistant for the Department of Planning and Economic Development . At that time , he took night classes at the Loyola University Chicago School of Law . He earned his law degree in 1985 and became a member of the Loyola Law Review . 
 Chico has been married twice ; his first wife was Jeryl Minow , with whom he had three daughters . He is currently married to Sunny <unk> Chico , who has a son and daughter from a previous marriage .

 = Battle of the Notch = 
 The Battle of the Notch was an engagement between United States and North Korean forces early in the Korean War on August 2 , 1950 in southern South Korea . The fight ended in a victory for the United States after North Korean forces attempting to assault the US position were blocked and repelled repeatedly , suffering heavy casualties . 
 Reeling from the Hadong Ambush and being driven from the city of Chinju , the US Army 's 19th Infantry Regiment , 24th Infantry Division scrambled to protect the pass into Masan , the final South Korean city before the Naktong River , where the UN was holding its Pusan Perimeter in place . North Korean and US forces unexpectedly ran into one another and a confused battle ensued . American forces were better equipped with heavy weapons and armor thanks to newly arrived equipment in the country , and their better ground during the battle allowed them to repel North Korean advances . 
 The North Korean force eventually withdrew after several unsuccessful attacks , having suffered heavy casualties . As it was disengaging from Masan , US Air Force aircraft caught the North Korean truck columns as they were retreating , inflicting significant damage on them and producing further casualties . This fight , with a number of smaller engagements in the region , effectively stopped the North Korean offensive on the southern flank of the Pusan Perimeter . It also gave both sides a reprieve from the fighting to resupply and re @-@ enforce before engaging in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter shortly after . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Outbreak of war = = = 
 Following the outbreak of the Korean War after the invasion of the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) by its northern neighbor , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( North Korea ) , the United Nations decided to commit troops to the conflict on behalf of South Korea . The United States subsequently committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing . However , US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II , five years earlier , and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army , which was headquartered in Japan . The division was understrength , and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending . Regardless , the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea . 
 The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial " shock " of North Korean advances , delaying much larger North Korean units to buy time to allow follow on forces to arrive . The division was consequently alone for several weeks as it attempted to delay the North Koreans , making time for the 7th Infantry Division , 25th Infantry Division , 1st Cavalry Division , and other Eighth Army supporting units to move into position . Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 , during the first battle between American and North Korean forces . For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith , 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the North Korean force 's superior numbers and equipment . The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south in battles around Chochiwon , Chonan , and Pyongtaek . The 24th Infantry Division made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon , being almost completely destroyed but delaying North Korean forces from advancing until July 20 . By that time , the Eighth Army 's force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region , with new UN units arriving every day . 
 = = = North Korean advance = = = 
 With Taejon captured , North Korean forces began the effort of surrounding the Pusan Perimeter from all sides in an attempt to envelop it . The North Korean 4th Infantry Division and the North Korean 6th Infantry Division advanced south in a wide maneuver . The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN 's left flank and were extremely spread out . They advanced on UN positions pushing back US and South Korean forces repeatedly . Forces of the 3rd Battalion , 29th Infantry Regiment , newly arrived in the country , were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27 , leaving open a pass to the Pusan area . Soon after , Chinju to the west was taken , pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan open for North Korean forces . 
 Reeling from the loss , UN planners hastily moved reserve forces to the southwest to repel North Korean advances . Several US infantry regiments as well as the command post of the 24th Infantry Division moved to establish new positions to prevent North Korean forces from advancing from Chinju . American forces moved to defend the city of Masan , the last key city before the North Koreans reached the perimeter . Located in the mountainous region along South Korea 's southern coast , Masan was accessible by two routes from the west . Major General John H. Church , the 24th Infantry Division 's commander , emplaced the 19th Infantry Regiment and the 27th Infantry Regiment in the area to defend Masan . Eventually , the 27th set up along the southern entrance while the 19th Infantry covered the north , in a pass known as " The Notch , " southwest of Chungam @-@ ni . The entire 19th Infantry Regiment , reeling from the fight at Chinju and attempting to hold back North Korean advances , fell back to the Notch . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The 1st Battalion , 19th Infantry was assigned to hold the Notch and the high ground on the right flank , to the northwest . Republic of Korea troops led by Colonel Min would hold the high ground to the southwest of the Notch . Meanwhile , 2nd Battalion , 19th Infantry withdrew to reserve positions at the northern base of the pass . During the evening of July 31 , 1st Battalion , 29th Infantry also arrived in the region . More importantly , A Company of the <unk> Medium Tank Battalion , armed with M4 Sherman medium tanks rebuilt in Japan , arrived at Masan , some of the first heavy armor the UN had in the war . One platoon of A Company 's tanks went to the 27th Infantry in the south while the 19th Infantry in the north got the other half . This put the force of the 19th Infantry and supporting units at 2 @,@ 335 under the command of Colonel Ned D. Moore , excluding the South Korean forces . 
 The number of North Korean forces committed to the region is not known , however later research suggests that the North Korean 6th Division committed at least a battalion to the fight , and it is likely that an entire regiment was ordered to advance on the Notch and Masan . This would put the range of North Korean forces involved in the battle between 500 and 2 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Attack = = = 
 At 06 : 45 on August 2 , C Company , 1st Battalion , 19th Infantry began to move out from its positions on a reconnaissance patrol supported by tanks and armored cars . Before the armored column left the lines , it ran head @-@ on into a North Korean attack starting on the Notch , as mortar fire and three heavy machine guns opened up on it from 200 yards ( 180 m ) below the crest of the pass . The road before the pass erupted into a frantic and confused struggle , C Company in the lead was struck with machine gun fire , killing most of its 1st Platoon before the men could disembark from their trucks . American soldiers who dove for cover in the ditches along the road found North Korean soldiers already in cover there . The lead M4 was struck with mortar fire and destroyed , while anti @-@ tank weapons set at least one American truck on fire . During this fight , advancing North Korean troops captured at least a few of the surprised American soldiers , using them as human shields when advancing up the high ground where the rest of the UN force was firing down at them . In the end , the initial ambush cost the Americans about 30 casualties . C Company overcame several North Korean attempts to cut them off before withdrawing back to the American lines . 
 American forces were quick to counter the attack . M20 recoilless rifles destroyed the machine gun positions , and American mortars began firing on any North Korean positions they could locate . However , North Korean forces were quick to advance up the Notch , to the crest of the hill that made up the pass . There , the discovered B Company , 19th Infantry , encamped . The 19th Infantry was apparently not prepared for combat , as North Korean forces were able to hit the American force and drive it off the hill , killing several of the American soldiers with bayonets . At about 12 : 00 , B Company was driven from the crest of the Notch , and further confusion erupted when US Air Force aircraft accidentally strafed the retreating B Company . Neighboring positions also mistakenly attacked B Company , which retreated with 12 killed . 
 South Korean forces , meanwhile , had emplaced in the wrong position , a mile too far south , and were not in contact with 19th Infantry . The South Korean forces were subsequently hit with friendly and enemy fire , and in the confusion the 19th Infantry attempted to block the South Koreans from advancing , thinking them enemy forces . North Korean snipers were able to infiltrate the rear of the position and kill five UN soldiers with shots to the back of the head . However American forces repelled several advances on the right flank . The M4 Shermans gave the American force a superiority in armor over the North Koreans for the first time , and were crucial in pushing back each attempted North Korean advance . North Korean infantry , unsupported by armor of their own , suffered heavy casualties from the American forces in their positions on the high ground . 
 = = = North Korean withdrawal = = = 
 Fighting at the Notch continued through the afternoon , but , the attack still unsuccessful , the North Korean troops withdrew suddenly in the mid @-@ afternoon , allowing American forces to recover most of the casualties and vehicles from the Notch . In the meantime , they set up roadblocks to prevent further North Korean attacks from moving down the road . North Korean forces disengaged from the fight without attempting to flank the Americans , and by nightfall they were out of the region . In the meantime , the 27th Infantry Regiment surprised a large column of North Korean forces advancing on the south road and captured many trucks of supplies . During the North Koreans ' retreat from the two roads , US Air Force planes mounted an airstrike against the North Koreans and inflicted heavy casualties . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The American forces reported 57 killed , 37 wounded , 17 missing and 6 captured , for a total of 117 casualties from the 19th and 29th Infantry Regiments . This number was far lighter than casualties for other unit actions of similar size so far in the war . North Korean casualties are unknown but believed to be far heavier than the American force . Actions in the Notch , as well as attacks on the region for the next few days are known to have largely destroyed the North Korean 6th Division , and over 50 percent of its force became casualties in the fighting . 
 The fight was one of the first victories for American forces in repelling the North Korean advance . In stopping the North Korean advance at the Notch and around Masan , the UN forces were able to halt the progress of the North Korean 4th and 6th Divisions , grounding their flanking moves to a halt and forcing them to withdraw to rebuild and re @-@ supply . In the meantime , the American forces along the perimeter were being reinforced by heavier infantry and armor formations every day . The North Korean defeat and retreat around the Masan region allowed both sides several critical days of reprieve from battle . This would end when the North Korean force began its final offensive on the UN forces in its coordinated assault on the Pusan Perimeter . 
 = Laika = 
 Laika ( Russian : <unk> ; c . 1954 – November 3 , 1957 ) was a Soviet space dog who became one of the first animals in space , and the first animal to orbit the Earth . Laika , a stray dog from the streets of Moscow , was selected to be the occupant of the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2 that was launched into outer space on November 3 , 1957 . 
 Little was known about the impact of spaceflight on living creatures at the time of Laika 's mission , and the technology to de @-@ orbit had not yet been developed , and therefore Laika 's survival was not expected . Some scientists believed humans would be unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space , so engineers viewed flights by animals as a necessary precursor to human missions . The experiment aimed to prove that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and endure micro @-@ gravity , paving the way for human spaceflight and providing scientists with some of the first data on how living organisms react to spaceflight environments . 
 Laika died within hours from overheating , possibly caused by a failure of the central R @-@ 7 sustainer to separate from the payload . The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002 ; instead , it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or , as the Soviet government initially claimed , she was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion . 
 On April 11 , 2008 , Russian officials unveiled a monument to Laika . A small monument in her honour was built near the military research facility in Moscow that prepared Laika 's flight to space . It features a dog standing on top of a rocket . She also appears on the Monument to the Conquerors of Space in Moscow . 
 = = Sputnik 2 = = 
 After the success of Sputnik 1 in October 1957 , Nikita Khrushchev , the Soviet leader , wanted a spacecraft launched on November 7 , 1957 , the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution . Construction had already started on a more sophisticated satellite , but it would not be ready until December ; this satellite would later become Sputnik 3 . 
 Meeting the November deadline meant building a new craft . Khrushchev specifically wanted his engineers to deliver a " space spectacular " , a mission that would repeat the triumph of Sputnik 1 , stunning the world with Soviet prowess . Planners settled on an orbital flight with a dog . Soviet rocket engineers had long intended a canine orbit before attempting human spaceflight ; since 1951 , they had lofted 12 dogs into sub @-@ orbital space on ballistic flights , working gradually toward an orbital mission set for some time in 1958 . To satisfy Khrushchev 's demands , they expedited the orbital canine flight for the November launch . 
 According to Russian sources , the official decision to launch Sputnik 2 was made on October 10 or 12 , leaving less than four weeks to design and build the spacecraft . Sputnik 2 , therefore , was something of a rush job , with most elements of the spacecraft being constructed from rough sketches . Aside from the primary mission of sending a living passenger into space , Sputnik 2 also contained instrumentation for measuring solar radiation and cosmic rays . 
 The craft was equipped with a life @-@ support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide . A fan , designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded 15 ° C ( 59 ° F ) , was added to keep the dog cool . Enough food ( in a gelatinous form ) was provided for a seven @-@ day flight , and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste . A harness was designed to be fitted to the dog , and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing , sitting , or lying down ; there was no room to turn around in the cabin . An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate , maximum arterial pressure , and the dog 's movements . 
 = = Training = = 
 Laika was found as a stray wandering the streets of Moscow . Soviet scientists chose to use Moscow strays since they assumed that such animals had already learned to endure conditions of extreme cold and hunger . This specimen was an eleven @-@ pound mongrel female , approximately three years old . Another account reported that she weighed about 6 kg ( 13 lb ) . Soviet personnel gave her several names and nicknames , among them Kudryavka ( Russian for Little Curly ) , <unk> ( Little Bug ) , and <unk> ( Little Lemon ) . Laika , the Russian name for several breeds of dogs similar to the husky , was the name popularized around the world . The American press dubbed her <unk> ( mutt + suffix <unk> ) as a pun on Sputnik , or referred to her as Curly . Her true pedigree is unknown , although it is generally accepted that she was part husky or other Nordic breed , and possibly part terrier . NASA refers to Laika as a " part @-@ Samoyed terrier . " A Russian magazine described her temperament as phlegmatic , saying that she did not quarrel with other dogs . Vladimir Yazdovsky , who led the program of test dogs used on rockets , in a later publication wrote that “ Laika was quiet and charming ” . 
 The Soviet Union and United States had previously sent animals only on sub @-@ orbital flights . Three dogs were trained for the Sputnik 2 flight : Albina , Mushka , and Laika . Soviet space @-@ life scientists Vladimir Yazdovsky and Oleg Gazenko trained the dogs . 
 To adapt the dogs to the confines of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2 , they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days . The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating , made them restless , and caused their general condition to deteriorate . <unk> did not improve their condition , and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective . The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft . This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30 – 65 torr . The dogs were trained to eat a special high @-@ nutrition gel that would be their food in space . 
 Before the launch , one of the scientists took Laika home to play with his children . In a book chronicling the story of Soviet space medicine , Dr. Vladimir Yazdovsky wrote , " Laika was quiet and charming ... I wanted to do something nice for her : She had so little time left to live . " 
 = = Preflight preparations = = 
 Vladimir Yazdovsky made the final selection of dogs and their designated roles . Laika was to be the " flight dog " — a sacrifice to science on a one @-@ way mission to space . Albina , who had already flown twice on a high @-@ altitude test rocket , was to act as Laika 's backup . The third dog Mushka was a " control dog " — she was to stay on the ground and be used to test instrumentation and life support . 
 Before leaving for the Baikonur Cosmodrome , Yazdovsky and Gazenko conducted surgery on the dogs - they routed the cables from the transmitters to the sensors that would measure breathing , pulse , and blood pressure . 
 Because the existing airstrip at <unk> near the cosmodrome was small , the dogs and crew had to be first flown aboard a Tu @-@ 104 plane to Tashkent . From there , a smaller and lighter Il @-@ 14 plane took them to <unk> . Training of dogs continued upon arrival ; one after another they were placed in the capsules to get familiar with the feeding system . 
 According to a NASA document , Laika was placed in the capsule of the satellite on October 31 , 1957 — three days before the start of the mission . At that time of year the temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold , and a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm . Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch . Just prior to liftoff on November 3 , 1957 from Baikonur Cosmodrome , Laika 's fur was sponged in a weak alcohol solution and carefully groomed , while iodine was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions . 
 One of the technicians preparing the capsule before final liftoff states that " after placing Laika in the container and before closing the hatch , we kissed her nose and wished her bon voyage , knowing that she would not survive the flight . " 
 = = Voyage = = 
 The exact time of the liftoff varies from source to source and is mentioned as 05 : 30 : 42 Moscow Time or 07 : 22 Moscow Time . At peak acceleration Laika 's respiration increased to between three and four times the pre @-@ launch rate . The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats / min before launch and increased to 240 beats / min during the early acceleration . After reaching orbit , Sputnik 2 's nose cone was jettisoned successfully ; however the " Block A " core did not separate as planned , preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly . Some of the thermal insulation tore loose , raising the cabin temperature to 40 ° C ( 104 ° F ) . After three hours of weightlessness , Laika 's pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats / min , three times longer than it had taken during earlier ground tests , an indication of the stress she was under . The early telemetry indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food . After approximately five to seven hours into the flight , no further signs of life were received from the spacecraft . 
 The Soviet scientists had planned to euthanize Laika with a poisoned serving of food . For many years , the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from asphyxia , when the batteries failed , or that she had been euthanized . Many rumors circulated about the exact manner of her death . In 1999 , several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth orbit . In October 2002 , Dimitri <unk> , one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission , revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating . According to a paper he presented to the World Space Congress in Houston , Texas , " It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints . " 
 Over five months later , after 2 @,@ 570 orbits , Sputnik 2 — including Laika 's remains — disintegrated during re @-@ entry on April 14 , 1958 . 
 = = Ethics of animal testing = = 
 Due to the overshadowing issue of the Soviet vs. U.S. Space Race , the ethical issues raised by this experiment went largely unaddressed for some time . As newspaper clippings from 1957 show , the press was initially focused on reporting the political perspective , while the health and retrieval — or lack thereof — of Laika only became an issue later . 
 Sputnik 2 was not designed to be <unk> , and Laika had always been intended to die . The mission sparked a debate across the globe on the mistreatment of animals and animal testing in general to advance science . In the United Kingdom , the National Canine Defence League called on all dog owners to observe a minute 's silence , while the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( RSPCA ) received protests even before Radio Moscow had finished announcing the launch . Animal rights groups at the time called on members of the public to protest at Soviet embassies . Others demonstrated outside the United Nations in New York ; nevertheless , laboratory researchers in the U.S. offered some support for the Soviets , at least before the news of Laika 's death . 
 In the Soviet Union , there was less controversy . Neither the media , books in the following years , nor the public openly questioned the decision to send a dog into space . It was not until 1998 , after the collapse of the Soviet regime , that Oleg Gazenko , one of the scientists responsible for sending Laika into space , expressed regret for allowing her to die : 
 Work with animals is a source of suffering to all of us . We treat them like babies who cannot speak . The more time passes , the more I 'm sorry about it . We shouldn 't have done it ... We did not learn enough from this mission to justify the death of the dog . 
 In other Warsaw Pact countries , open criticism of the Soviet space program was difficult because of political censorship ; however , there were notable cases of criticism in Polish scientific circles . A Polish scientific periodical , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> " , published in 1958 , discussed the mission of Sputnik 2 . In the periodical 's section dedicated to astronautics , Krzysztof <unk> described the Sputnik 2 mission as " regrettable " and criticized not bringing Laika back to Earth alive as " undoubtedly a great loss for science " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Laika is memorialized in the form of a statue and plaque at Star City , Russia , the Russian Cosmonaut training facility . Created in 1997 , Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect . The Monument to the Conquerors of Space , constructed in 1964 , also includes Laika . On April 11 , 2008 at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight , officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket . 
 Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered . Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions : Bars and <unk> were killed when their R @-@ 7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on July 28 , 1960 ; <unk> and Mushka died when Korabl @-@ Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on December 1 , 1960 . 
 = Devil 's Due ( Star Trek : The Next Generation ) = 
 " Devil 's Due " is the 13th episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next Generation , originally aired on February 4 , 1991 in broadcast syndication in the United States . Based on an episode written by William Douglas Lansford for the planned Star Trek : Phase II ( 1978 ) television series , it was adapted for The Next Generation by Philip <unk> and directed by Tom Benko . 
 Set in the 24th century , the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet starship USS Enterprise @-@ D. In " Devil 's Due " , the crew of the Enterprise confront an individual claiming to be Ardra ( Marta DuBois ) , a mythological entity from the planet <unk> II . She claims that the planet , and the orbiting Enterprise , are her legal property due to an agreement signed a thousand years earlier . Together , Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) and the crew reveal Ardra to be a con artist , leading to her arrest by the Ventaxian authorities . 
 Numerous changes were made from the original Phase II script , with only the general theme of the episode remaining . Originally pitched for use during season three , following changes made it was added to season four . Critical reception of the episode has been mixed , with it generally being thought to be very reminiscent of Star Trek : The Original Series .

 The USS Enterprise receives a distress call from Dr. Howard Clarke ( Paul Lambert ) , the leader of a Federation scientific delegation on <unk> II , where the population is in a state of panic because they are convinced that their world will soon end . After the Enterprise arrives , they rescue Dr. Clarke who brings them up to date : a thousand years ago , according to Ventaxian history , the population entered a Faustian deal with Ardra , their mythology 's devil . In exchange for ending wars and restoring the ecological balance , and improving their heavily polluted planet , the population would become the personal slaves of Ardra a thousand years later . As the millennium is about to come to a close , the planet has recently begun experiencing mild earthquakes as well as seeing images of Ardra in the skies . These were said to be signs of her arrival . 
 As Captain Picard and Commander Data ( Brent Spiner ) discuss the matter with the Ventaxian leader ( Marcelo <unk> ) , a woman appears in the chamber , announcing herself as Ardra . She proves her identity by starting an earthquake at will , and transforming into both the Christian and then the Klingon devil . Ardra states that she has come to claim the planet . Picard is instantly suspicious and orders Data to examine the contract that supposedly was signed by Ardra and the leaders of the planet a thousand years ago . Picard returns to the Enterprise afterwards , and Ardra appears on the bridge sitting in the Captain 's chair . Security Chief Worf ( Michael Dorn ) tries to remove her without success , Data returns just then and confirms the language of the contract as well as Ardra 's claim to the planet , including anything in orbit , including the Enterprise . 
 Later , in a meeting with the senior staff , Picard expresses his belief that she is a con @-@ artist and points out that all of her " powers " can be recreated with theatrically delivered technology . After the meeting , Picard goes to bed for the evening . As Picard sleeps , Ardra appears and tries to seduce him but he rejects her . She transports him to the planet dressed in his pyjamas . Data comes to collect Picard by shuttle after Worf is unable to transport him back the normal way . When Picard and Data attempt to return to the Enterprise , the ship disappears . Not knowing what to do , they return to the planet . 
 Citing old legal precedent , Picard calls for a Ventaxian arbitration hearing , which Ardra agrees to as long as Data acts as the arbitrator , as he will act with impartiality , to which Picard agrees . During the course of the hearing , Chief Engineer La Forge ( LeVar Burton ) and Clarke discover that Ardra has a cloaked ship nearby , that she is indeed using technology to simulate magic , and that she is a known criminal . Picard has an away team led by Commander Riker ( Jonathan Frakes ) take control of Ardra 's ship , giving Picard control of Ardra 's " powers " . He demonstrates the fraud and she is taken into custody by local authorities . Picard explains to the leader of the planet that the people themselves improved their planet gradually through hard work and dedication .

 The episode was originally developed from a premise for the cancelled Star Trek : Phase II , although it underwent significant changes . It first appeared in a memo dated August 16 , 1977 , as part of a status update for the cancelled series . The only other episode of Phase II to be redeveloped for The Next Generation was " The Child " from season two . 
 In the original version , the Enterprise visits <unk> and meets the planet 's leader , Zxolar , who is concerned that Captain Kirk is an alien called Komether who is due to return within twenty days to destroy their world . Zxolar suddenly collapses and Doctor McCoy tries to help him but an energy surrounds the doctor 's head and he runs at a wall and disappears . The landing party search for McCoy but to no avail and Zxolar is beamed to the Enterprise . Doctor Chapel attempts to help him but the energy appears around her and she passes out . Xon and Kirk discuss the energy and realise it wants Zxolar to die as it has attacked anyone who helps him . The pair beam back down the planet to investigate the palace they met Zxolar in and discover an archive which shows them the original agreement made by six philosophers , including a much younger Zxolar , and Komether a thousand years earlier . They note one of the philosophers is Zxolar and the Komether is the energy being which attacked the two doctors . As in the later version used on Star Trek : The Next Generation , the agreement was that the being would correct the pollution of the planet in return for ownership of the planet a thousand years later . Xon and Kirk decide to move <unk> to a life support table and ask for other volunteers as it is apparent that Komether will attack them as they attempt to save him . Scotty , Sulu and Chekov all volunteer as well , and the alien disables each of them as they move Zxolar . It is only because of Xon 's strength as he is being attacked that they manage to attach Zxolar to a life support machine and his life signs immediately improve . Zxolar tells Kirk about the contract , who retrieves it from the planet 's surface and challenges it . <unk> appears and agrees to a trial with the Enterprise 's computer acting as an impartial judge . Kirk realises that <unk> was created by the six philosophers and so as the last remaining , Zxolar is in control of it . Zxolar manages to defeat the creature using his will and releases the stunned crewmen . He finds that McCoy was trapped in the wall itself and releases him too , the Enterprise departing shortly thereafter . 
 The story was once again brought up during a story pitch for season three of Next Generation , and it was modified by several staff writers . Michael Piller made several changes , including making the devil character female . Marta DuBois was cast as Ardra , after Stella Stevens and Adrienne Barbeau were also considered . Paul Lambert had previously appeared in the episode " When the Bough Breaks " as a member of the Aldean race . This episode illustrates Arthur C. Clarke 's Third Law : " any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic . "

 Several reviewers re @-@ watched Star Trek : The Next Generation after the end of the series . Keith DeCandido watched the episode for Tor.com , and thought that Marta DuBois ' performance was " the only reason why this episode is in any way watchable . Barely " . He thought that the episode felt more similar to an original series story than a normal Next Generation story , and that was due to the episode 's origins . He said " overall , it ’ s just dumb " and gave it a score of two out of ten . Zack Handlen thought more positively of the episode when he reviewed it for the A.V. Club . He did think that Captain Picard was pretending to be Captain Kirk for most of the episode and that it didn 't have any real drama but that it was " silly , goofy fun for the most part " . He thought the episode was " cute " and gave it an overall score of B + . 
 Robert Blackman was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Costumes for a Series for his work in this episode . It was instead awarded to Bill <unk> for his work on the Murphy Brown episode " Eldin <unk> Life " . Blackman would go on to win the award for the following two years for the episodes " Cost of Living " and " Time 's Arrow , Part II " . The episode was first released on VHS cassette on May 21 , 1996 . The episode was later included on the Star Trek : The Next Generation season four DVD box set , released in the United States on September 3 , 2002 . The first Blu Ray release was in the United Kingdom on July 29 , 2013 , followed by the United States on July 30 . 
 = Lemmings ( video game ) = 
 Lemmings is a puzzle @-@ platformer video game originally developed by DMA Design and first published by Psygnosis for the Amiga , Atari ST and PC in 1991 . The game was programmed by Mike Dailly and David Jones , and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint . 
 The objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit . To save the required number of lemmings to win , one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape , to affect the behaviour of other lemmings , or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings . 
 Lemmings was one of the best @-@ received video games of the early 1990s . It was the second highest rated game in the history of Amstrad Action , and was considered the eighth greatest game of all time by Next Generation in 1996 . Lemmings is also one of the most widely ported video games , and is estimated to have sold over 15 million copies between its various ports . The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several sequels , remakes and spin @-@ offs , and has also inspired similar games . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Lemmings is divided into a number of levels , grouped into four difficulty categories . Each level begins with a trap door opening from above , releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other . Levels include a variety of obstacles that prevent lemmings from reaching the exit , such as large drops , booby traps and pools of lava . 
 The goal is to guide at least a certain percentage of the green @-@ haired , blue @-@ robed lemmings from the entrance to the exit by clearing or creating a safe passage through the landscape for the lemmings to use . Unless assigned a special task , each lemming will walk in one direction ignoring any other lemming in its way ( except " Blockers " ) , falling off any edges and turning around if they hit an obstacle they cannot pass . A lemming can die in a number of ways : falling from a great height , falling into water or lava , disappearing off the top , bottom or side of the level map , being caught in a trap or fire , or being assigned the Bomber skill . Every level has a time limit ; if the clock counts down to zero , the level automatically ends . 
 To successfully complete the level , the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings . Which skills and how many uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level , and the player must assign the skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings . There are eight skills that can be assigned : ' Climbers ' climb vertically though fall down if they hit an overhang . ' <unk> ' use a parachute to fall safely from heights . ' Bombers ' explode after a five @-@ second timer , destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity , though not damaging other Lemmings or traps . ' Blockers ' stand still and prevent other Lemmings from passing ; Lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction . ' Builders ' build a stairway of 12 steps . ' Bashers ' , ' Miners ' and ' Diggers ' dig horizontally , diagonally downwards or directly downwards respectively . 
 While the player is able to paws ( wordplay in the game ) the game to inspect the level and status of the lemmings , skills can only be assigned in real @-@ time . Lemmings are initially released at a rate predetermined by the level ( from 1 to 99 ) . The player can increase the rate as desired to a maximum of 99 , and later decrease it down to , but not lower than , the initial rate . The player also has the option to " nuke " all the remaining lemmings on the screen , converting them to Bombers . This option can be used to abort a level when in a no @-@ win situation , remove any Blockers that remain after the remaining lemmings have been rescued , or end a level quickly once the required percentage of saved lemmings has been reached . 
 The four difficulty groups – " Fun " , " Tricky " , " Taxing " and " Mayhem " – are used to organise the levels to reflect their overall difficulty . This rating reflects several factors , including the number of obstacles the player has to surpass , the limitation on the number of types of skills available to assign , the time limit , the minimum rate of lemming release , and the percentage of lemmings that must be saved . 
 = = = Two @-@ player mode = = = 
 The original Lemmings also has 20 two @-@ player levels . This took advantage of the Amiga 's ability to support two mice simultaneously , and the Atari 's ability to support a mouse and a joystick simultaneously . Each player is presented with their own view of the same map ( on a vertically split screen ) , can only give orders to their own lemmings ( green or blue ) , and had their own base . The goal is to get more lemmings ( regardless of colour ) into one 's own base than the other player . Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home . 
 = = Development = = 
 Mike Dailly , the first employee of DMA Design and one of the programmers for Lemmings , provided a detailed history of the development of the game entitled " The Lemmings Story " in 2006 . David Jones , founder of DMA Design , has also commented on the development and success of Lemmings . 
 The inspiration for gameplay came as a result of a simple animated character sprite in an 8 × 8 pixel box created by Dailly using Deluxe Paint as part of development for Walker , then envisioned as a sequel to Blood Money . Dailly was able to quickly produce an animated graphic showing his creations moving endlessly , with additional graphical improvements made by Gary Timmons and other members of the DMA Design team to help remove the stiffness in the animation . One member , Russell Kay , observed that " There 's a game in that ! " , and later coined the term " lemmings " for these creations , according to Dailly . Allowing the creatures to move across the landscape was based on a Salamander weapon concept for Blood Money and demonstrated with the animations . 
 Levels were designed based on a Deluxe Paint interface , which allowed several of the members to design levels , resulting in " hundreds of levels " . There were several internal iterations of the levels , each designer challenging the others . Dailly pointed out that David Jones " used to try and beat us , and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying ' There ! Beat that ! ' , we 'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps , and doing it in a much simpler method . ' Oh ... ' , he 'd mutter , and scramble off to try and fix it . " They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis , getting back the results of their testing via fax . While most were solved quickly , Dailly commented that " Every now and again though , the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again ; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels , and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside . " 
 Each of the designers had a somewhat different style in their levels : Dailly 's levels often had titles containing clues to what to do ( such as " It 's Hero Time " , suggesting that one lemming had to be separated from the crowd ) and generally required the player to perform several actions at once ; Gary Timmons 's levels were minimalistic , with popular culture references in the titles , and Scott Johnston 's ( whose mother was the first voice of the lemmings ) levels were generally tightly packed . Dailly was also responsible for the " custom " levels based on other Psygnosis and Reflections Interactive Amiga games , such as Shadow of the Beast , Menace , Awesome and Shadow of the Beast II . These " crossover " levels also used music from those games , though in ports these levels have been removed or altered to remove such references . After they developed most of the hard levels , they then created several simple levels either by copying the existing ones or creating new layouts ; as Dailly states , " This I believe is where many games fall down today , they do not spend the time making a good learning curve . " Timmons is credited with the official drawings of the lemmings , as necessitated by the need of Psygnosis for box cover artwork . 
 Music was originally created by Brian Johnston ( Scott 's younger brother ) , who sampled bits of copyrighted music . This had been common practice , but at that point there was a growing awareness of music copyright . Psygnosis asked Tim Wright to replace the offending tracks , who often used arrangements and reworkings of classical and traditional music to avoid copyright problems . Music tracks in the game include : " Galop Infernal " from Orpheus in the Underworld ( the music by Offenbach often used for the can @-@ can ) , " Rondo alla <unk> " from Mozart 's Piano Sonata No. 11 , " Dance of the Reed Flutes " from Tchaikovsky 's Nutcracker Suite , " Dance of the Little Swans " from Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake , " Ten Lemmings " ( a track that uses melodies from traditional song " Ten Green Bottles " ) , Chopin 's Piano Sonata No. 2 ( the part used as funeral march ) , Wagner 's " Bridal Chorus " ( popularly known as " Here Comes the Bride " ) , " London Bridge is Falling Down " , the English folk tune " Forest Green " ( adapted into the hymn " All Beautiful the March of Days " ) , the carol " O Little Town of Bethlehem " mixed with the melody from the film The Good , the Bad and the Ugly , " She 'll Be Coming ' Round the Mountain " and " ( How Much Is ) That Doggie in the Window ? " . 
 The two @-@ player option was inspired by then @-@ current games Populous and Stunt Car Racer . DMA Design initially wanted to use a null @-@ modem connection between two machines to allow competitive play , but ended up using the ability of the Amiga to have two mouse pointer devices usable at the same time and thus created the split @-@ screen mode . 
 = = Ports and remakes = = 
 The popularity of the game on the Amiga led to its rapid porting to many other platforms , and it is regarded as one of the most widely ported video games . Within a year of its release , the game had been ported to Atari ST , Sinclair Spectrum , PC and SNES . David Jones stated that after porting the game to 20 systems , he stopped keeping count of additional ports . Other commercial ports of the original game include 3DO , Acorn Archimedes , Apple II , Apple Macintosh , <unk> , Commodore 64 , NES , Sega Master System and Genesis , TurboGrafx @-@ 16 , Philips CD @-@ i and Sharp X68000 . 
 In early 2006 , Sony released a remake of Lemmings for the PlayStation Portable , developed by <unk> . It features all 120 levels from the original game , 36 brand new levels as well as <unk> support ( similar to the Extra Track system featured in Wipeout Pure ) , and a user level editor . Every level in the game is a pre @-@ rendered 3D landscape , although their gameplay is still 2D and remains faithful to the original game . User levels can be constructed from pre @-@ rendered objects and distributed by uploading them to a PlayStation @-@ specific Lemmings online community . The soundtrack also marks the final video game score created by longtime composer Tim Follin after he announced his retirement from the industry in mid @-@ 2005 . In October 2006 the game was ported by developer Rusty Nutz for the PlayStation 2 with use of the EyeToy . The basic change in the concept is that the player must stretch and use his / her limbs in the recorded picture to aid the lemmings . In 2007 , <unk> produced a similar remake of Lemmings for the Sony PlayStation 3 for download through the PlayStation Network . The game has the similar graphical improvements as the PSP title , as well as on @-@ line scoreboards and additional levels developed for high @-@ definition display , but lacks the ability to create and share levels as the PSP version offers . 
 = = = Expansions = = = 
 Lemmings received some expansion packs following its launch . Oh No ! More Lemmings , originally released for the Amiga in 1991 both as a data disk or standalone game , added five varying difficulties — Tame , Crazy , Wild , Wicked and Havoc — each with 20 new levels . The game also features enhanced graphics and altered sound effects . The expansion was also ported to Acorn Archimedes , Atari ST , DOS , Macintosh , and Sam Coupé , and the levels were made available with the Game Boy Color , Microsoft Windows , PlayStation and Sega Genesis versions of Lemmings . Oh No ! More Lemmings received generally positive reviews . Dan Slingsby of CU Amiga found the game addictive , calling the puzzles " ingenious " , and Peter Lee of Amiga Action praised the quality and difficulty of the levels ; Stuart Campbell of Amiga Power was disappointed by the lack of fixes from the original game , and Ed Ricketts of ST Format criticised the difficulty gradient of the levels and the price of the expansion , but both ultimately gave positive reviews nonetheless . 
 Christmas Lemmings , also known as Holiday Lemmings , was also released as a series of short games released between 1991 and 1994 . The gameplay remains unchanged from the base game , which is not required . First released as Xmas Lemmings as two four @-@ level demos in 1991 and 1992 , there were two later full retail releases on the Amiga and Atari ST in 1993 and 1994 , both with an additional 32 levels . The games were well @-@ received ; Rob Mead of Amiga Format described it as " funny , frustrating and incredibly addictive " , despite being disappointed by the number of levels , and Will Greenwald of PC Magazine ranked it among the best Christmas video games in 2014 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The original sales for Lemmings on the Amiga topped 55 @,@ 000 copies on the first day of sales ; in comparison , Menace sold 20 @,@ 000 copies and Blood Money sold 40 @,@ 000 copies cumulatively . With all the ports included , it has been estimated that over 15 million copies of Lemmings have been sold between 1991 and 2006 . 
 At the time of its first release , Lemmings received several high scores from gaming magazines , with only the level of graphics and sound receiving some small amount of criticism . David Sears of Compute ! , in his review of Lemmings for the PC , stated that " perhaps Psygnosis has tapped into the human instinct for survival in formulating this perfect blend of puzzle , strategy , and action . " Amiga Computing stated that " Lemmings is absolutely brilliant . Psygnosis have managed to produce a game that is not only totally original , but also features the kind of addicting gameplay that will keep the player coming back for more time and time again . " A review from the Australian Commodore and Amiga Review ( ACAR ) stated that " above all , the concept is simple , and the game is a lot of fun . " Computer Gaming World stated that " Not since Tetris has this reviewer been so addicted to , or completely fascinated with , a series of challenging puzzles ... follow the crowd and get Lemmings " . In 1992 the magazine named it its Action Game of the Year . The game was reviewed in 1991 in Dragon by Hartley , Patricia , and Kirk Lesser in " The Role of Computers " column . The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars . The Lessers reviewed the MacIntosh version of the game in 1993 in Dragon , also giving that version 5 stars . 
 In 1994 Electronic Gaming Monthly complimented the Lynx version 's large number of options and password feature , and remarked , " Lemmings has always been a good strategy game , and the Lynx version continues the tradition . " The following year they reviewed the CD @-@ i version , criticising that it has nothing but the obligatory full motion video intro to set it apart from the numerous ports of the game that had already been released over the past four years . GamePro made the same criticisms , commenting that " this former 16 @-@ bit puzzler isn 't going anywhere new on the CD @-@ i . " 
 Next Generation 's review of the 3DO version assessed that " If you 've played any version , you 've played this one , too , but if you haven 't tried it , this is one of the better ones , and it 's still one game that 's addictive as hell . " 
 In 1996 , Next Generation declared it the 8th greatest game of all time , and " second only to Tetris " in the puzzle genre . In 2004 , readers of Retro Gamer voted Lemmings as the 21st top retro game , with the editors calling it " perhaps Psygnosis ’ finest hour and a turning point in the puzzle genre . " 
 Lemmings for the PSP was warmly received , with a 76 / 100 average rating at Metacritic . According to the review by GameSpot , " Lemmings is a game @-@ design classic that is as compelling now in its newest iteration on the PlayStation Portable as it was 15 years ago . " Eurogamer complained that the game was the otherwise bare port of the game to yet another system . The PSN version 's inability to create levels or play competitively online resulted in the game receiving mediocre reviews , with an averaged Metacritic score of 59 / 100 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Lemmings inspired several sequels , including the Christmas Lemmings short games that were released between 1991 and 1994 , and the 1991 expansion Oh No ! More Lemmings . Stand @-@ alone sequels were Lemmings 2 : The Tribes ( 1993 ) , All New World of Lemmings ( 1994 ) , 3D Lemmings ( 1995 ) and Lemmings Revolution ( 2000 ) . Two spin @-@ off games were also made , both in 1996 ; Lemmings <unk> and The Adventures of Lomax . 
 Numerous clones of Lemmings were made . One of the first was The Humans , released for the Amiga in 1992 . General game concepts have been included in the open source <unk> , where the player is required to safely guide penguins across landscapes using a similar array of tools . Other similar games include Clones . 
 In 2010 , it was announced that Lemmings would be ported to the iOS operating system by developer Mobile 1UP . On 29 June 2010 , Mobile 1UP reported that Sony Computer Entertainment Europe had presented them with a cease @-@ and @-@ desist letter , forcing them to halt development of the port . In April 2011 , Mobile 1UP has released a re @-@ worked version of the work done in 2010 with a prehistoric setting ( new artwork , <unk> , music , levels ) under the name Caveman , available for the iOS and <unk> platforms . Brutal Deluxe , the developer who did the porting of the Apple <unk> version of Lemmings , has released the games ' source code . 
 Lemmings has also been called a predecessor of the modern real @-@ time strategy ( RTS ) video game genre . A 1991 Amiga Power article claimed that Lemmings " was the first major game to introduce the ' indirect @-@ control ' concept , " an element that is now common in many RTS games . Lemmings ' introduction of RTS elements has been noted by fantasy author Terry Pratchett ; in his novel Interesting Times , an army of golems is controlled in a fashion reminiscent of the Lemmings user interface . When readers asked if this was deliberate , Pratchett responded : " Merely because the red army can fight , dig , march and climb and is controlled by little icons ? Can 't imagine how anyone thought that ... Not only did I wipe Lemmings from my hard disk , I <unk> it so 's I couldn 't get it back . " 
 Yannick LeJacq of Kotaku , commenting on the 2014 game <unk> which incorporates elements of Lemmings and Tetris , speculated that games like Lemmings would not be very successful in the current gaming market , as the pace of the game is far too slow to satisfy most players . 
 = = Computational Complexity = = 
 In 2004 , Graham <unk> proved that decide whether it is possible to complete a level of Lemmings is NP @-@ complete . Later , Graham showed that it 's <unk> @-@ complete to find the maximal possible number of lemmings saved in a level of Lemmings . 
 Note that these two questions are different , since one asks for saving any number of lemmings that 's more than the minimal amount required to pass the level , while the other asks for saving as many as possible . Clearly , the later is harder than the former .

 Matt Leto ( born December 1 , 1983 ) , gamertag Zyos , is a former American professional player of the first @-@ person shooter video games Halo : Combat Evolved and Halo 2 . Zyos spent a year in his late teens accumulating video game records , and for a while was the holder of the most records . After dropping out of DigiPen Institute of Technology , Leto pursued a career in professional gaming . 
 Leto won the 2003 and 2004 World Cyber Games , and was signed to become a professional game player that same year . He remained champion until he was defeated in 2005 , and was known for his quiet , patient style of play , and his skill in one @-@ on @-@ one matches . In 2006 he retired from professional gaming . He is currently working as a real estate agent in Texas .

 Leto played his first video game at the age of five , playing Super Mario Bros. In his early teens he played and won local video game competitions . At the age of 17 , he broke the world record for points scored in the video game Crazy Taxi , and when Twin Galaxies , which records video game records , wanted more proof , he recorded a video of beating his own record . He then spent the next year focused on breaking video game records and eventually broke 742 of them . He had the highest number of records ever achieved until Tom Duncan surpassed him . Originally Zyos was interested in going to DigiPen Institute of Technology to learn how to create video games , but found it intense and that it was not his passion . Having dropped out of college , he later left his job at an ice cream shop at age 19 and began pursuing a career in professional gaming . In late 2002 Leto competed at <unk> , his first video game tournament , and though his team placed fifth , he ranked second individually out of three hundred players .

 In the fall of 2003 , Leto was recruited to play professionally for Major League Gaming ( MLG ) at the age of 19 . That year , he was part of the four man team " Dream Team " . He won the top prize at the World Cyber Games 2003 held in Seoul , South Korea , winning $ 20 @,@ 000 . It was at that point that Zyos decided he could play video games as his career . That year , Zyos earned $ 30 @,@ 000 from professional gaming . He also signed an endorsement deal with <unk> that placed an endorsing quote on an Xbox shooter game titled Greg Hasting 's Tournament <unk> . 
 = = = 2004 = = = 
 In 2004 , GameSpot described Leto as the " number one Halo player in the United States " . Leto came in second at the 2004 Dallas Midwestern Regional Tournament in the " Halo Free For All " category , and first in the N @-@ Gage Competition playing Tony Hawk . As part of Team FFA competing in Major League Gaming tournaments , he helped defeat Shoot to Kill in an upset victory in Chicago , and then also Atlanta . Later in the MLG tournament series he was part of the Florida Jackalopes and were defeated in New York by Team Domination . At the MLG San Francisco tournament Zyos agreed to split the prize money with his final competitor " Mighty " before the final game , and claimed to do so in order to make his opponent less hungry for victory . 
 Leto participated in the World Cyber Games 2004 in San Francisco . In preparation for the World Cyber games , Zyos traveled for the two weeks prior to practice playing against his competitors . At the opening ceremony of the games , Leto was player representative , having been the previous year 's champion , and called on players to have good sportsmanship . In the final game , Leto led early 13 – 5 , but his opponent rallied to 13 – 10 before Zyos was able to also rally and defeat him . Zyos thus won the Gold medal for the second year in a row , defeating Canadian Nelson Triana 2 – 0 in the " best out of three " format . He said that his second victory was more important than his first , since he is now the third person to win two years in a row .

 At the Game Riot Conference in 2005 , amateur players had a chance to play against Zyos to win prizes ; Leto viewed the touring gaming exposition as a chance to build his reputation . In 2005 , Zyos did paid endorsements and had a managing team . He also came in third at the Major League Games Competition as part of team Str8 Rippin . That team went on to defeat rivals " <unk> " in Philadelphia . Later that summer , he joined Team " Trademark Gamers " , and later the " IGS <unk> " . On September 13 , 2005 Zyos was defeated by the Ogre twins in the third game of the World Cyber Games ' United States Finals . Leto attributed his loss to his weakness in two @-@ on @-@ two play , and stated his desire to continue playing one on one . In October 2005 , Zyos competed and won the <unk> Tournament Series Halo 2 tournament , defeating " <unk> " in the final match . 
 = = = 2006 = = = 
 Leto competed professionally in Halo 2 and Project Gotham Racing 3 at the World Series of Video Games in July 2006 at the Gaylord Texan Resort & Convention Center . He was also invited to attend the Championship Gaming Series that year . Following his defeat , he considered playing another first @-@ person shooter or a future Halo game . In September of that year he visited the Cyber World Games and attendees had the opportunity to be taught how to play Halo 2 . He was a part of team <unk> <unk> , thought to be one of the top four Major League Gaming teams in 2006 . The team was defeated by teams " <unk> " and <unk> , and ultimately placed seventh . Following the defeats , Zyos exited his hotel where he was staying for the tournament and has not returned to professional gaming . His retirement was called the ninth most important event in professional gaming that year by Major League Gaming . 
 = = Technique = = 
 Zyos studied his opponent 's style of play in order to find weaknesses . He also practiced four to five hours to day , and the week before a tournament for ten . He stated that most of the stress of competing is mental , though physical fitness helps in tournaments that can last 16 hours per day . Talents he has suggested players need include quick reflexes , concentration , and the ability to play under pressure . The transition from Halo to Halo 2 was a mixed bag for Zyos , since he called it an " easier game " , but tournaments started being more focused on two @-@ on @-@ two . Once Halo 2 was released , Leto began to focus almost exclusively on it and did not play the original at all . 
 While on Team Str8 Rippin in 2005 , Leto stated that their style was unique , since any team member might take on any role in their attack formation . They were also patient , content to wait their enemies out and force the opposing team to attack when Str8 Rippin is ahead .

 " You Never Give Me Your Money " is a song by the Beatles , appearing on their 1969 album Abbey Road . It was written by Paul McCartney ( though credited to Lennon – McCartney ) and documented the financial and personal difficulties facing the band . The track is the first track of the medley on side two of Abbey Road and was recorded in stages between May and August 1969 . 
 The song was the first one to be recorded for the medley , which was conceived by McCartney and producer George Martin as a finale for the Beatles ' career . The backing track was recorded at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes , London , but the remainder of overdubs occurred at Abbey Road Studios . Musically , the song is made up of a suite of various segments , ranging from a piano ballad at the beginning through to guitar arpeggios at the end . 
 = = Background = = 
 The song was written by McCartney when he was staying with new wife Linda in New York in March 1969 , shortly after the Get Back sessions that ultimately resulted in Let It Be . John Lennon and McCartney were at risk of losing overall control of Northern Songs , the company that published their songs , after ATV Music bought a majority share . McCartney had been largely responsible for the group 's direction and projects since the death of manager Brian Epstein in 1967 , but began to realise that the group dynamic of the Beatles was coming to an end . He was particularly unhappy at the others wanting to draft in manager Allen Klein to help sort out their finances . McCartney later said that the song was written with Klein in mind , saying " it 's basically a song about no faith in the person " . He added that the line " One sweet dream , pack up the bags , get in the limousine " was based on his trips in the country with Linda to get away from the tense atmosphere with the Beatles , though author Walter Everett thought the line was also a nostalgic look at the Beatles ' touring years , which had ended in 1966 . 
 The musical structure came from several song fragments , beginning with a piano ballad and moving to a number of different styles , including boogie @-@ woogie piano , arpeggiated guitars and nursery rhyme . Beatles author Ian MacDonald speculated that the guitar arpeggios at the end of the track were influenced by " I Want You ( She 's So Heavy ) " and the middle section of " Here Comes the Sun " , and the overall structure was inspired by Lennon 's " Happiness Is a Warm Gun " from the previous year 's The Beatles , which also joined unrelated song fragments together . 
 Realising that Abbey Road could be the group 's last album , McCartney and Martin decided to combine various portions of tracks into a medley , which would act as a climactic finale of the group 's career . McCartney later said that the idea of a song suite was inspired by Keith West 's " Excerpt from A Teenage Opera " . Some musical segments of " You Never Give Me Your Money " were reused for the " Golden Slumbers " / " Carry That Weight " portion of the medley , including the opening verses and later guitar arpeggios . 
 = = Recording = = 
 The basic backing track was recorded at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes on 6 May 1969 . Recording started at 3pm and went on until 4am the next morning . McCartney sang lead and played piano , Lennon played an Epiphone Casino guitar , George Harrison played a Fender Telecaster guitar fed through a Leslie speaker , and Ringo Starr played drums . The group recorded 36 takes , selecting take 30 as the best , which was made into a rough stereo mix . The basic structure of the song as it appeared on Abbey Road had not been worked out at this stage , and the original recording ran onto a loose jam session , ending up as a fast rock @-@ and @-@ roll instrumental towards the end . 
 The track was completed in Abbey Road Studios . McCartney overdubbed a lead vocal onto the basic track on 1 July , and further vocals and sound effects were added on 15 July . On 30 July , a reduction mix was made of the original eight track tape , so further overdubs could be made , and a rough mix of the Abbey Road medley was put together . The cross @-@ fade from " You Never Give Me Your Money " into the next track , " Sun King " , proved to be problematic , and the group made several attempts before deciding to merge the songs via an organ note . McCartney completed the instrumental overdubs the next day , on 31 July , by adding a bass guitar part and additional piano overdubs , including some punched @-@ in honky @-@ tonk piano in place of the original . 
 The final recording session occurred on 5 August , when McCartney made a number of tape loops at Abbey Road , including bells , birds , bubbles and chirping crickets . Martin mixed the track into stereo on 13 August , and made 11 attempts at a final mix , combining the tape loops with the cross @-@ fade into " Sun King " , replacing the earlier organ note . He made another attempt at a final mix on 21 August , and this was used for the finished master .

 = Jarlsberg Tunnel = 
 The Jarlsberg Tunnel ( Norwegian : <unk> ) is a 1 @,@ 750 @-@ meter ( 5 @,@ 740 ft ) long double track railway tunnel which runs through Frodeåsen in Tønsberg , Norway . Located on the Vestfold Line , the tunnel was built as part of the 7 @.@ 8 @-@ kilometer ( 4 @.@ 8 mi ) double @-@ track high @-@ speed segment from Barkåker to Tønsberg . It is located just north of Tønsberg Station and runs between <unk> and Tomsbakken . Most of the tunnel is blasted , although 223 meters ( 732 ft ) is in a concrete culvert . Planning of the tunnel started in the late 1990s . Several railway interest groups advised against building the isolated segment of upgraded track without a complete plan for upgrading the entire line . Construction started in April 2009 and the new section and the tunnel opened on 7 November 2011 . It was the fourth segment of the Vestfold Line to be upgraded . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 The Jarlsberg Tunnel runs roughly north – south through Frodeåsen , a hill just north of the town center of Tønsberg . The northern entrance is located at Tomsbakken , beside County Road 35 and the southern entrance is located at <unk> in the town center . Just south of the tunnel lies Tønsberg Station . The tunnel is 1 @,@ 750 meters ( 5 @,@ 740 ft ) long , of which 1 @,@ 560 meters ( 5 @,@ 120 ft ) is blasted through bedrock and 223 meters ( 732 ft ) is concrete culvert . The portal on the Tønsberg side is 73 meters ( 240 ft ) long . 
 The Jarlsberg Tunnel constitutes the southernmost part of the 7 @.@ 8 @-@ kilometer @-@ long ( 4 @.@ 8 mi ) double @-@ track segment of the Vestfold Line between Barkåker and Tønsberg . It is electrified at 15 kV 16 2 ⁄ 3 Hz AC , has an NSI @-@ 63 signaling system and is dimensioned for 200 kilometers per hour ( 120 mph ) . The crosscut serves as an emergency exit . The railway tunnel crosses 2 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 0 meters ( 8 ft 2 in to 9 ft 10 in ) above the Frodeåsen Tunnel , a twin @-@ tube tunnel of County Road 300 . The tunnel 's single crosscut serves as an emergency exit . The line is owned and maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration . 
 = = History = = 
 The Vestfold Line opened in 1881 as a narrow @-@ gauge railway . Although later converted to standard gauge and electrified , the line retains poor capacity and many curves . The only previous tunnel north of Larvik is the 288 @-@ meter @-@ long ( 945 ft ) <unk> Tunnel , which was completed in 1921 . In the early 1990s , work started on increasing speed , capacity and reliability by building shorter sections of double @-@ track with higher permitted speeds . During this period , there was very little investment funding for railways ; thus the Vestfold Line was split into a series of small segments , each which was planned individually . Between 1995 and 2003 , three sections with a combined length of 23 kilometers ( 14 mi ) were opened . The segment between Barkåker and Tønsberg was the fourth section of the line to be upgraded . When later projects are completed , it will allow travel time from Tønsberg to Oslo to be reduced from 90 to 60 minutes . 
 Initial planning of the segment between Barkåker and Tønsberg considered 13 different initial route proposals . However , no analysis for possible rights @-@ of @-@ way south of Tønsberg or north of Barkåker were considered . In September 1999 , the government presented their proposal for National Transport Plan 2002 – 11 , which included three segments on the Vestfold Line : Holm – <unk> , Barkåker – Tønsberg and <unk> – Porsgrunn . When Parliament passed the plan in February 2001 , the Barkåker – Tønsberg segment was prioritized second on the Vestfold Line , after a new passing loop at <unk> . National Transport Plan 2002 – 11 proposed that construction start in 2005 , but by November 2002 , the National Rail Administration delayed the plans , following investment cuts by Bondevik 's Second Cabinet . In response , Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm stated that she was considering financing the project as a public – private partnership paid through a surcharge on tickets fares . 
 The route will give a time saving of between three and four minutes for trains heading north of Tønsberg , but two minutes of these will be saved by changing the direction the trains run through the loop through town . Thus , passengers traveling southwards from Tønsberg experience a two @-@ minute increase in travel time . The plan to make an isolated investment in the Barkåker – Tønsberg section was criticized by several pro @-@ railway interest organizations , including Norsk Bane , For <unk> , the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature as well as the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) — who operates the train service . All recommended that the National Rail Administration place the investments on hold until more of the Vestfold Line was planned . NSB 's Tom <unk> called the plans " troublesome " and stated that the trains would have nearly no time or reliability @-@ gains from the investment . If the authority instead had built more double track in connection with the existing segment at Sande , trains could more efficiently catch up any delays before reaching Drammen . 
 Long @-@ term plans for the line imply that the line will need to allow a through speed of at least 250 kilometers per hour ( 160 mph ) and be built so trains do not need to stop or slow down at all stations . The National Rail Administration had at the time of construction not made any plans for a route south of Tønsberg ; estimates from Norsk Bane show that Tønsberg will not be able to allow high through speeds and that a new through line would have be built with a different right @-@ of @-@ way , entirely avoiding the Jarlsberg Tunnel . Alternatively , the route would have to feature slow speeds or large encroachments on the local environment . By binding the Vestfold Line to run via Barkåker , it is not possible to build a high @-@ speed line with stations serving population centers such as Horten , <unk> and <unk> . For <unk> advised against building the Barkåker – Tønsberg segment and instead recommended that the authorities wait until the entire Vestfold Line was planned . 
 Following the appointment of Stoltenberg 's Second Cabinet in 2005 , the government started working with longer projects and increased funding . The go @-@ ahead for the project was given by Minister of Transport Liv Signe Navarsete on 31 March 2008 , with the entire project from Barkåker to Tønsberg estimated to cost 1 @.@ 37 billion Norwegian krone ( NOK ) . The main civil engineering advisor for the project was <unk> . Six bids were issued to building the main segment , which included the tunnel and 2 @.@ 6 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) from Tomsbakken to Barkåker Industrial Park . The bidders were a joint venture between Reinertsen and Leonard Nilsen , Veidekke , Skanska , <unk> Entreprenør , NCC and Mika . The contract was awarded on 5 March 2009 to Reinertsen / Leonard Nilsen , who had the lowest bid , NOK 377 @.@ 9 million , NOK 158 million less than the most expensive , from Mika . The joint venture was structured so Leonard Nilsen built the tunnel and Reinertsen the above @-@ ground section . 
 Construction of the project started on 16 March 2009 ; work on the tunnel started in April and the first blasting began on 11 May . Construction ran from a crosscut in the center of the tunnel and outwards ; average speed was 35 to 40 meters ( 115 to 131 ft ) per week . Work on casting the concrete portals started on 18 September . For four weeks , starting in January 2010 , blasting was performed above the Frodeåsen Tunnel , and on each occasion that the 100 or so blasts were executed , the road was closed for safety reasons . Following a public naming competition , the National Rail Administration announced on 5 February 2010 that the tunnel be known as the Jarlsberg Tunnel . The first breakthrough of the tunnel was achieved on 30 June 2010 . The second and final breakthrough took place on 1 September . Construction proceeded without any injuries and nearly without any complications . The tunneling resulted in 235 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 231 @,@ 000 long tons ; 259 @,@ 000 short tons ) of earthwork , which was used to build the above @-@ ground section north of the tunnel . The last concrete casting was laid on 20 January 2011 . 
 Laying of the track was performed by Wiebe , signaling was installed by Norsk <unk> , <unk> Rail installed the overhead wire , and <unk> installed the power supply and telecommunications systems . The tunnel has the NSI @-@ 63 relay @-@ based signaling system , although it is scheduled to be replaced by European Rail Traffic Management System shortly after 2015 . The last six weeks before opening , the Vestfold Line was closed to allow the new and old sections to be connected . This was the most hectic part of construction , as it saw the tracks south of the tunnel be rearranged to allow trains to operate the opposite direction through the loop in Tønsberg . The work was performed by Reinertsen and took 100 @,@ 000 man @-@ hours . 
 The tunnel and the segment Barkåker – Tønsberg opened on schedule on 7 November 2011 . The segment cost NOK 1 @.@ 5 billion , which was within budget . However , at the time of the opening , double track was still not laid from the tunnel to Tønsberg Station . Previously , trains crossed each other at the passing loop at the closed Barkåker Station , with one train having to wait for the other . With the competition of the new segment , trains could pass at any point between Tønsberg and Barkåker , allowing increased reliability . However , the signaling system was not installed at the time of opening , so the tunnel remained only operated with single track , although a temporary signaling system allowed it to be used as a passing loop . If used as such , speed was limited to 70 kilometers per hour ( 43 mph ) .

 " Un @-@ American Graffiti " is the sixteenth episode of the third season of the American mystery television series Veronica Mars , and the sixtieth episode overall . Written by Robert Hull and directed by John T. Kretchmer , the episode premiered on The CW on May 1 , 2007 . The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars ( Kristen Bell ) as she deals with life as a college student while moonlighting as a private detective . 
 In this episode , Veronica is hired by an Arab couple who own a Middle Eastern restaurant because their restaurant has recently had the word " terrorist " spray @-@ painted on it . Meanwhile , Keith ( Enrico Colantoni ) , as acting Sheriff , looks into underage drinking regulations in local bars after the case of a drunk 19 @-@ year @-@ old getting hit by a car comes to Keith 's attention , eventually finding that Veronica is handing out convincing fake IDs to her fellow students . In addition , Veronica attends a birthday party run by Logan ( Jason Dohring ) for his new girlfriend Parker ( Julie Gonzalo ) . 
 " Un @-@ American Graffiti " was the first episode of the series not to be part of a larger story arc . This was a change that had been decided upon midway through the season , and series creator Thomas thought that this would make the series more accessible to new viewers . In addition , the episode aired after a two @-@ month hiatus , during which period Thomas created the idea for season four taking place in the FBI Academy . 
 In its original broadcast , the episode garnered 2 @.@ 35 million viewers and generally negative reviews from television critics , with many criticizing the case @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week as cliché and moralistic . Eric Goldman of IGN compared the episode negatively to an after school special , while Rowan Kaiser , writing for The A.V. Club , disliked the portrayal of Rashad .

 Logan invites Veronica to Parker ’ s birthday party . A woman ( Carole <unk> Davis ) comes into Mars Investigations and says that her restaurant was vandalized . Veronica stakes out the restaurant before the owner ’ s husband ( Anthony Azizi ) comes out and berates her to leave . However , while they are speaking , a group of troublemakers appear and shoot <unk> at Veronica and the married couple . The husband acquiesces to allow Veronica to investigate both incidents further . Keith , as acting Sheriff , is called in to look into a case involving a 19 @-@ year @-@ old who was hit while returning home drunk from a bar using an obviously fake ID . Veronica tracks down the family of the car that was used in the paintball incident and finds that it is under the control of a group of young people . Keith ’ s underlings state that the bars are actually good at keeping out minors . Veronica reviews security cameras at the restaurant and tracks a person down to be a Jewish man with whom the restaurant owner ’ s daughter has been having an affair . 
 An employee named Nasir ( <unk> <unk> ) has taken explicit photos of the two , and Amira ’ s father will disown her if the father finds out . Veronica goes to a photo @-@ developing store and retrieves the photos , but one is stuck in the printer and Nasir gets it . Amira ’ s father shows up at her door and angrily berates her and fires Veronica , although she says that her real employer is his wife . Keith catches Wallace and Piz , out for a night on the town , in a bar , discovering that they have high @-@ quality fake IDs from Veronica , leading Keith to reprimand her . Veronica discovers the true vandal after tracking a piece of bait . The vandal ’ s name is Derrick ( Cole Williams ) , who vandalized after seeing Nasir distributing a piece of anti @-@ American propaganda at a mall . Both owners want to meet Derrick before pressing charges . Keith sends Piz ( Chris Lowell ) and Wallace ( Percy Daggs III ) with clearly fake IDs into a bar as a test of his subordinates . He finds that the deputy does not check closely and resents Keith as well . Due to this fact , Keith fires the people who disobeyed his orders . 
 The two restaurant owners meet with Derrick , who does not react politely to them . However , they decide not to turn in Derrick . The husband / father has an awakening about Amira as well and forgives her , turning in Nasir to the police for an expired visa . At Parker ’ s party , Mac ( Tina Majorino ) reconnects with Max ( Adam Rose ) , and Veronica shows mild jealousy when Piz shows her his new fling . Logan gets Parker a romantic cake . In order to escape from a awkward suitor whom Logan introduces her to , Veronica asks Piz to pretend to be her boyfriend . Afterwards , Wallace informs her that Piz does have a crush on her . Veronica realizes that she has not realized this because of her preoccupation with her breakup with Logan . She talks to Piz on the porch at the party , and he suddenly kisses her . Piz retreats to the elevator , but Veronica appears and kisses him back . The elevator opens , revealing Logan .

 " Un @-@ American Graffiti " was written by Robert Hull and directed by John T. Kretchmer , marking Hull 's second and final writing credit ( after " Show Me the Monkey " ) and Kretchmer 's fourteenth and final directing credit for the series . " Un @-@ American Graffiti " introduces a romantic storyline between Mac ( Tina Majorino ) and Max ( Adam Rose ) . Max had appeared in two previous episodes — as a suspect in " Hi , Infidelity " and as the main client in " Poughkeepsie , Tramps and Thieves " . From the very beginning of his appearances , Max was planned to begin a romantic relationship with Mac . Rose was roommates with the other main love interest for her , Bronson Pope ( Michael Mitchell ) . When Rose received the call that he would be appearing in more episodes for a romantic storyline with Mac , Rose stated , " But I thought that 's what my roommate was doing . " 
 " Un @-@ American Graffiti " is the first episode of Veronica Mars not to be part of a broader story arc in the form of a mystery that Veronica solves over several episodes . The crew 's plan at the beginning of the season was to have the two @-@ part murder mystery of Hearst 's basketball coach , encapsulated in " Postgame Mortem " and " Mars , Bars " , to stretch over the rest of the season beginning with this episode , but this idea was changed around the airing of " Spit & Eggs " . Series creator Rob Thomas gave two rationales for the creative change . The first was that he believed that the story arcs alienated new or casual viewers , meaning that the change would solve the series ' low Nielsen ratings , while the other reason was that he noticed that after the first season , the show had garnered the most narrative criticism about the story arcs . On trying the new narrative structure , Thomas stated , " It seems like a good time to do it — a good fun test balloon . Try it over five [ episodes ] and see how fans and non @-@ fans react . " However , Thomas also commented that the show would continue to exhibit a degree of serialization through Veronica 's romantic and personal life . In addition , the new story formula was a way to have episodes focus on Veronica 's personal life instead of devoting most of the episode time to advancing rushed mysteries . 
 The episode also features the first kiss of the characters of Piz ( Chris Lowell ) and Veronica , creating a love triangle between the two and Logan ( Jason Dohring ) that would last for the rest of the series and the Veronica Mars movie , dividing fans into " Team Logan " and " Team Piz " , depending on which relationship they preferred . The song " Rally " by alternative rock band Phoenix plays during Veronica and Piz 's kiss . Thomas highlighted the scene in Veronica returns home to find Keith reading classified ads as one of his favorite moments between the father / daughter pair in the season , stating that they both fulfilled the writers ' initial vision for the scene and that Kristen Bell in particular interpreted her lines well . 
 The episode was the first to air after nearly a two @-@ month hiatus , during which Thomas came up for the idea for season four to take place in the FBI Academy . Possibly done as a last @-@ resort attempt to save the show from cancellation , the series was very much on the brink of cancellation at this point in production . Prior to the airing of " Un @-@ American Graffiti " , Enrico Colantoni stated that The CW had seen the filmed first ten pages and reacted negatively . However , Thomas denied this testimony and commented that The CW had not yet seen the FBI pitch and would on May 2 , the day after the series ' return , a statement that was confirmed to be true by a representative for the network . Prior to the episode 's airing , information was released stating that middle school students would be involved in the episode , leading BuddyTV to speculate that Logan 's young friend from " Postgame Mortem " would make an appearance .

 " Un @-@ American Graffiti " received generally negative reviews from television critics , with many criticizing the case @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week as cliché and moralistic and opining that it was not a strong start for the show 's new episode formula .

He was very critical of the case @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week and Keith 's plotline as Sheriff , comparing them both negatively to an after school special . He disliked what he considered to be the cliché storyline and stereotyped characters of the restaurant plot , particularly the trope of the disapproving Arab @-@ American father and the plotline ending with a speech about the American dream , concluding that " even Veronica pointing out this cliché didn 't make it less so . " While opining that Logan 's actions were out of character , the reviewer was more positive towards the budding relationships of Veronica and Piz and Mac and Max . Television Without Pity graded the episode a " C " , with the reviewer stating that it was the only episode of the series that they did not like . Reviewer Alan Sepinwall , on his blog What 's Alan Watching ? , was very negative towards the episode . While stating that it was very preachy and generally boring , particularly in the case @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week , he believed that the episode was just a fluke because he had already been sent the next episode , " Debasement Tapes " , which he enjoyed .

 Kelly West of Cinema Blend was mixed towards the episode . While calling the new formula " a breath of fresh air , " she was not entirely pleased with the final scene featuring Piz and Veronica 's kiss , opining that the location and the fact that Veronica ran after Piz and kissed him back were not in keeping with Veronica 's character . Rowan Kaiser , writing for The A.V. Club was also critical of the case of the week and the episode in general . While admiring the show 's decision to address the controversial issue of Islamophobia in the United States , he did not like the show 's characterization of Rashad , the father , noting inconsistencies about whether his storyline was one of redemption or not . " There are three seemingly equal interpretations : that Veronica Mars writers believe that the cartoon is worth ruining someone 's life over ; that Rashad is a complex character who can be petty and vindictive ; or , it 's just a bunch of stuff that happens and there is no moral .

 = = Production = = 
 The material is prepared by heating powdered silicon between 1300 ° C and 1400 ° C in an atmosphere of nitrogen : 
 3 Si + 2 N 
 2 → Si 
 3N 
 4 
 The silicon sample weight increases progressively due to the chemical combination of silicon and nitrogen . Without an iron catalyst , the reaction is complete after several hours ( ~ 7 ) , when no further weight increase due to nitrogen absorption ( per gram of silicon ) is detected . In addition to Si 
 3N 
 4 , several other silicon nitride phases ( with chemical formulas corresponding to varying degrees of nitridation / Si oxidation state ) have been reported in the literature , for example , the gaseous <unk> mononitride ( Si 
 2N ) ; silicon mononitride ( SiN ) , and silicon <unk> ( Si 
 2N 
 3 ) , each of which are stoichiometric phases . As with other <unk> , the products obtained in these high @-@ temperature syntheses depends on the reaction conditions ( e.g. time , temperature , and starting materials including the reactants and container materials ) , as well as the mode of purification . However , the existence of the <unk> has since come into question . 
 It can also be prepared by <unk> route : 
 SiCl 
 4 + 6 NH 
 3 → Si ( NH ) 
 2 + 4 NH 
 4Cl ( s ) at 0 ° C 
 3 Si ( NH ) 
 2 → Si

 <unk> reduction of silicon dioxide in nitrogen atmosphere at 1400 – 1450 ° C has also been examined : 
 3 SiO 
 2 + 6 C + 2 N 
 2 → Si 
 3N 
 4 + 6 CO 
 The nitridation of silicon powder was developed in the 1950s , following the " rediscovery " of silicon nitride and was the first large @-@ scale method for powder production . However , use of low @-@ purity raw silicon caused contamination of silicon nitride by silicates and iron . The <unk> decomposition results in amorphous silicon nitride , which needs further annealing under nitrogen at 1400 – 1500 ° C to convert it to crystalline powder ; this is now the second @-@ most important route for commercial production . The carbothermal reduction was the earliest used method for silicon nitride production and is now considered as the most @-@ cost @-@ effective industrial route to high @-@ purity silicon nitride powder . 
 Electronic @-@ grade silicon nitride films are formed using chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) , or one of its variants , such as plasma @-@ enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( PECVD ) :

 For deposition of silicon nitride layers on semiconductor ( usually silicon ) substrates , two methods are used : 
 Low pressure chemical vapor deposition ( <unk> ) technology , which works at rather high temperature and is done either in a vertical or in a horizontal tube furnace , or 
 Plasma @-@ enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( PECVD ) technology , which works at rather low temperature and vacuum conditions . 
 The lattice constants of silicon nitride and silicon are different . Therefore , tension or stress can occur , depending on the deposition process . Especially when using PECVD technology this tension can be reduced by adjusting deposition parameters . 
 Silicon nitride nanowires can also be produced by sol @-@ gel method using carbothermal reduction followed by nitridation of silica gel , which contains ultrafine carbon particles . The particles can be produced by decomposition of dextrose in the temperature range 1200 – 1350 ° C. The possible synthesis reactions are : 
 SiO 
 2 ( s ) + C ( s ) → SiO ( g ) + CO ( g ) and 
 3 SiO ( g ) + 2 N 
 2 ( g ) + 3 CO ( g ) → Si 
 3N 
 4 ( s ) + 3 CO 
 2 ( g ) or 
 3 SiO ( g ) + 2 N 
 2 ( g ) + 3 C ( s ) → Si 
 3N 
 4 ( s ) + 3 CO ( g ) . 
 = = Processing = = 
 Silicon nitride is difficult to produce as a bulk material — it cannot be heated over 1850 ° C , which is well below its melting point , due to dissociation to silicon and nitrogen . Therefore , application of conventional hot press sintering techniques is problematic . Bonding of silicon nitride powders can be achieved at lower temperatures through adding additional materials ( sintering aids or " binders " ) which commonly induce a degree of liquid phase sintering . A cleaner alternative is to use spark plasma sintering where heating is conducted very rapidly ( seconds ) by passing pulses of electric current through the compacted powder . Dense silicon nitride compacts have been obtained by this techniques at temperatures 1500 – 1700 ° C.
