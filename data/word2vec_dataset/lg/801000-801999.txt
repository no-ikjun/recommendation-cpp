 = New Jersey Route 94 = 
 Route 94 is a state highway in the northwestern part of the New Jersey , United States . It runs 45 @.@ 94 mi ( 73 @.@ 93 km ) from the Portland – Columbia Toll Bridge over the Delaware River in Knowlton Township , Warren County , where it connects to Pennsylvania Route 611 ( PA 611 ) , northeast to the New York state line in Vernon Township , Sussex County . At the New York border , New York State Route 94 ( NY 94 ) continues to Newburgh , New York . Route 94 is mostly a two @-@ lane undivided road that runs through mountain and valley areas of Warren and Sussex counties , serving Columbia , Blairstown , Newton , and Hamburg . The route intersects several roads , including U.S. Route 46 ( US 46 ) and Interstate 80 ( I @-@ 80 ) in Knowlton Township , US 206 in Newton , Route 15 in Lafayette Township , and Route 23 in Hamburg . 
 What is now Route 94 was legislated as part of two separate routes in 1927 . The portion of road between Route 6 / US 46 near the Delaware Bridge to Newton became Route 8 , while the route north of Newton to the New York border became a part of Route 31 . Prior to 1953 , the only portion of Route 31 north of Newton that was a state highway was between North Church and Hamburg . In 1953 , Route 94 was designated to replace all of Route 8 as well as Route 31 north of Newton ; the number was chosen to match NY 94 . After the Portland – Columbia Toll Bridge and the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge were both completed in December 1953 , the southern terminus of Route 94 was cut back to an intersection with US 611 in Columbia , which had been rerouted into New Jersey across both bridges , following a freeway between Columbia and the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge that would later become a part of I @-@ 80 . The former alignment of Route 94 between the Delaware Bridge and the Portland – Columbia Toll Bridge became a part of US 46 . By 1969 , US 611 was routed out of New Jersey , and Route 94 was extended to the state line on the Portland – Columbia Toll Bridge . Through the 1960s and 1970s , a freeway was proposed for the Route 94 corridor . This freeway , proposed to be a part of the Interstate Highway System , was never built .

 Route 94 begins at the two @-@ lane undivided Portland – Columbia Toll Bridge over the Delaware River in Knowlton Township , where it connects to PA 611 on the Pennsylvania side of the river . This bridge is maintained by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission ; the rest of Route 94 is maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation ( NJDOT ) . Immediately after the bridge , the route comes to a large interchange with the western terminus of US 46 as well as with I @-@ 80 a short distance later , near the community of Columbia . In the area of the US 46 / I @-@ 80 interchange , the directions of Route 94 split , carrying two lanes in each direction . 
 From here , the route becomes a two @-@ lane undivided road that continues northeast through a mix of woods and farms with some development , passing under the abandoned Lackawanna Cut @-@ Off . After passing through the community of <unk> , the road turns more to the east and enters Blairstown Township . Route 94 turns northeast before reaching the community of Blairstown , where the road continues east past some development before intersecting CR 521 . It forms a short wrong @-@ way concurrency with that route , along which it crosses the Paulins Kill . A short distance later , Route 94 enters Frelinghuysen Township , passing through more rural surroundings . The road turns northeast through the community of <unk> before heading east again . After the intersection with CR 661 , Route 94 makes a sharp turn to the north @-@ northeast . 
 = = = Sussex County = = = 
 The route continues into Sussex County at <unk> Township , heading through rural areas . The road turns more to the northeast as a two @-@ lane road before heading east again and entering Newton . Here , Route 94 becomes High Street and passes several homes , intersecting CR 519 . CR 519 forms a concurrency with Route 94 and the two routes continue to downtown Newton . In the downtown area , the road comes to the Park Place square , where it meets US 206 . At this point , all three routes run concurrent north on four @-@ lane undivided Water Street for a short distance . CR 519 splits from the road by turning north on Mill Street , while US 206 and Route 94 continue north as a three @-@ lane road with a center left @-@ turn lane , where a shopping district lines the road as it leaves Newton for Hampton Township . The road narrows back to two lanes as it heads into areas of farmland . Route 94 splits from US 206 by making a right turn to continue east . 
 The road passes a mobile home park before making a turn northeast and heading into Lafayette Township . In Lafayette Township , the route resumes to the east through a mix of rural and industrial areas . The road continues to a junction with Route 15 , where Route 94 makes a right turn to head southeast along Route 15 in a wrong way concurrency . Upon splitting , Route 15 stays straight and heads southeast as Route 94 turns at a right hand reverse jughandle to head northeast . Route 94 continues through more rural areas with occasional development and enters Sparta Township , where it is known as North Church Road . Here , the road passes near some residential developments before continuing into Hardyston Township . In Hardyston Township , the route runs through the community of North Church . After making a sharp turn to the east , Route 94 enters Hamburg and becomes Vernon Avenue . The route passes a few homes before intersecting Route 23 in the center of town . From this intersection , the route makes a turn to the northeast before leaving the town and heading back into Hardyston Township . The road passes rural developed areas before entering Vernon Township . 
 At this point , the surroundings become more wooded and mountainous as the road passes near residential areas and reaches the community of McAfee . In McAfee , CR 517 intersects with Route 94 and the two routes head east for a short wrong way concurrency , crossing the New York , Susquehanna and Western Railway before CR 517 turns to the south . Route 94 continues northeast as McAfee Vernon Road , briefly becoming a divided highway as it passes the entrance to the Mountain Creek ski resort . Continuing northeast , the route comes to an intersection with CR 515 , which it runs concurrent with on Vernon Warwick Road . The two routes continue north , with CR 515 splitting from Route 94 a short distance after crossing the Appalachian Trail . From here , Route 94 continues through more countryside before reaching the New York state line , where the road continues into that state as NY 94 .

 In the 1927 renumbering of state highways , Route 8 was defined to run along present @-@ day Route 94 from Route 6 ( current US 46 ) at the Delaware Bridge north to Columbia before turning northeast to Route 31 ( now U.S. Route 206 ) in Newton . Past Newton , Route 31 continued northeast to the New York state line ( current US 206 north of here was Route S31 ) . In the original version of the renumbering bill , Route 31 was to reach the border via Sussex , incorporating pre @-@ 1927 Route 8 ( now Route 284 ) from Sussex to the state line . However , in the final version , Route 31 ran via Hamburg , using the same alignment as a planned spur of pre @-@ 1927 Route 8 from Lafayette to North Church . Route 8 was eventually taken over by the state . On the other hand , by 1949 , only one section of Route 31 north of the Route S31 split had been taken between North Church to Hamburg . 
 In the 1953 renumbering , Route 8 was renumbered to Route 94 , which was extended northeast past Newton along former Route 31 to the New York state line , matching NY 94 across the border . It was initially only marked south of Hamburg , as none of the route north of Hamburg was state @-@ maintained . Originally , Route 94 began at the now razed Delaware Bridge , where US 46 would cross into Pennsylvania . Route 94 would wind right and north @-@ east a few to Columbia , where it joined its current route . In December 1953 , both the Portland – Columbia Toll Bridge and Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge opened . That year a section of Old Mine Road was rebuilt and aligned as a four lane freeway between Columbia and the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge . Following this , US 46 was rerouted over the first several miles of Route 94 between the Delaware Bridge and Columbia , and Route 94 was cut back to Columbia , near the Portland @-@ Columbia Toll Bridge . Here , US 46 would end and US 611 , would cross the Portland @-@ Columbia Toll Bridge from Pennsylvania and follow the freeway north to the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge . The freeway portion that US 611 followed became a part of I @-@ 80 in 1959 . When US 611 was removed from New Jersey by 1969 , Route 94 was extended to the state line on the Portland @-@ Columbia Toll Bridge . Also by this time , the unsigned portions of Route 94 north of Newton were signed . In 1973 , this whole area was realigned into a complex interchange as the New Jersey portion of Interstate 80 was completed . 
 In 1964 , a Route 94 freeway was proposed to run from I @-@ 80 in Netcong north to the planned Route 23 freeway in Hamburg , following US 206 north to Newton and current Route 94 to Hamburg . In the late 1960s , the NJDOT planned for the Route 94 freeway to run from I @-@ 80 / US 46 in Columbia northeast to the New York border near Wawayanda State Park . The NJDOT hoped to get funding for the freeway in 1970 for it to become an Interstate highway as it was planned to serve a proposed national recreation area along the Delaware River that would have been built in conjunction with the controversial Tocks Island Dam project . This proposed Interstate , which was to run from I @-@ 80 in Hope Township to I @-@ 84 in Port Jervis and continue northeast along US 209 , was denied funding . After reviewing the proposal again in 1972 , the NJDOT determined that the freeway would cost $ 96 million . It was eventually canceled due to environmental concerns and financial constraints .

 = Troop sleeper = 
 In United States railroad terminology , a troop sleeper was a railroad passenger car which had been constructed to serve as something of a mobile barracks ( essentially , a sleeping car ) for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations . This method allowed part of the trip to be made overnight , reducing the amount of transit time required and increasing travel efficiency . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background and development = = = 
 Between December , 1941 and June , 1945 U.S. railroads carried almost 44 million armed services personnel . As there were not enough cars and coaches available to meet the massive need for troop transit created by World War II , in late 1943 the U.S. Office of Defense Transportation contracted with the Pullman Company to build 2 @,@ 400 troop sleepers , and with American Car and Foundry ( ACF ) to build 440 troop kitchen cars . 
 This new rolling stock was either converted from existing boxcars or built from scratch based on Association of American Railroads ( AAR ) standard 50 ' -6 " single @-@ sheathed steel boxcar designs , and were constructed entirely out of steel with heavily reinforced ends . In some instances baggage cars were converted into temporary kitchen cars before ACF could complete its order . The cars were painted the standard Pullman Green and affixed with gold lettering . Along the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway 's ( <unk> ) " Surf Line , " trains consisting of 10 @-@ 12 former Southern Pacific interurban trailer cars , owned by the U.S. Maritime Commission but bearing <unk> markings , were fitted with conventional knuckle couplers at each end of the trainset and pressed into service to handle the additional passenger loads . 
 Equipped with special Allied Full Cushion high @-@ speed swing @-@ motion trucks , Pullman troop sleepers were designed to be fully interchangeable with all other passenger equipment . The units came equipped with end doors similar to those found on standard railway cars , but had no vestibules . Loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished via wide doors positioned on each side at the center of the cars with built @-@ in trap doors and steps . Light and ventilation was provided by ten window units mounted on each side , each equipped with rolling black out shades and wire mesh screens . 
 Troop sleepers , generally intended for use by enlisted personnel , were equipped with bunks stacked 3 @-@ high , and slept 29 servicemen plus the Pullman porter . Every passenger was provided with a separate Pullman bed , complete with sheets and pillowcases that were changed daily . The berths were laid out in a cross @-@ wise arrangement that placed the aisle along one side of the car , as opposed to down the center . Though the upper berths were fixed , the middle and lower sections could be reconfigured into seating during the daytime . Weapon racks were provided for each group of berths . Four washstands ( two mounted at each end of the car ) delivered hot and cold running water . The cars also came outfitted with two enclosed toilets and a drinking water cooler . 
 = = = Troop kitchens = = = 
 Troop kitchens , rolling galleys , also joined the trains to provide meal service en route ( the troops took their meals in their seats or bunks ) . As the cooking was performed by regular U.S. Army cooks , the cars were outfitted with two Army @-@ standard coal ranges . The cars were also equipped with a pair of 200 @-@ gallon cold water tanks and a 40 @-@ gallon hot water tank ; supplies were stocked on open shelves with marine @-@ type railings , a bread locker , a large refrigerator , and a series of built @-@ in cabinets and drawers . The cars served approximately 250 men each , and were typically placed in the middle of the train so that food could be served from both ends . 
 Troop hospital cars , also based on the troop sleeper carbody , transported wounded servicemen and typically travelled in solid strings on special trains averaging fifteen cars each . Each had 38 berths for patients , 30 of which were arranged in the central section of the car in three tiers on each side . There was also a section with six berths which could be used for isolation cases as well as private compartments for special cases . Each unit was ice air @-@ conditioned and came fitted with a shower room along with a modern kitchen with the latest equipment . 
 = = = Afterlife and preservation = = = 
 Troop cars saw service through 1947 , after which many were sold by the U.S. Army Transportation Corps to the railroads and subsequently converted into mail cars , express service boxcars , or refrigerator cars , while others remained in sleeper configuration for use in maintenance of way ( <unk> ) service as bunk cars for the maintenance workers . Subsequent conflicts have not created the need for such an arrangement , partially due to the much smaller level of manpower involved but primarily due to the wider use of aircraft for long @-@ distance transportation of troops . 
 Today , preserved troop sleepers can be seen in several railroad museums across the United States . 
 Troop sleeper # <unk> is on display at the B & O Railroad Museum in Baltimore , MD . It was purchased as surplus by the Western Maryland Railroad and used on work trains as crew quarters . The museum has restored it to its original outside appearance . The inside has half the beds put back and the other half has displays about the B & O RR during the war . 
 = French battleship Condorcet = 
 Condorcet was one of the six Danton class semi @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the French Navy in the mid @-@ 1900s . When World War I began in August 1914 , she unsuccessfully searched for the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and the light cruiser SMS Breslau in the Western and Central Mediterranean . Later that month , the ship participated in the Battle of Antivari in the Adriatic Sea and helped to sink an Austro @-@ Hungarian protected cruiser . Condorcet spent most of the rest of the war blockading the Straits of Otranto and the Dardanelles to keep German , Austro @-@ Hungarian and Turkish warships bottled up . 
 After the war , she was modernized in 1923 – 25 and subsequently became a training ship . In 1931 , the ship was converted into an accommodation hulk . Condorcet was captured intact when the Germans occupied Vichy France in November 1942 and was used by them to house sailors of their navy ( Kriegsmarine ) . She was badly damaged by Allied bombing in 1944 , but was later raised and scrapped by 1949 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Although the Danton @-@ class battleships were a significant improvement from the preceding Liberté class , they were outclassed by the advent of the dreadnought well before they were completed . This , combined with other poor traits , including the great weight in coal they had to carry , made them unsuccessful ships overall , though their numerous rapid @-@ firing guns were of some use in the Mediterranean . 
 Condorcet was 146 @.@ 6 meters ( 481 ft 0 in ) long overall and had a beam of 25 @.@ 8 m ( 84 ft 8 in ) and a full @-@ load draft of 9 @.@ 2 m ( 30 ft 2 in ) . She displaced 19 @,@ 736 metric tons ( 19 @,@ 424 long tons ) at deep load and had a crew of 681 officers and enlisted men . The ship was powered by four Parsons steam turbines using steam generated by twenty @-@ six Niclausse boilers . The turbines were rated at 22 @,@ 500 shaft horsepower ( 16 @,@ 800 kW ) and provided a top speed of around 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . Condorcet reached a top speed of 19 @.@ 7 knots ( 36 @.@ 5 km / h ; 22 @.@ 7 mph ) on her sea trials . She carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 027 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 995 long tons ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 3 @,@ 370 miles ( 2 @,@ 930 nmi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Condorcet 's main battery consisted of four 305mm / 45 Modèle 1906 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets , one forward and one aft . The secondary battery consisted of twelve 240mm / 50 Modèle 1902 guns in twin turrets , three on each side of the ship . A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats . These included sixteen 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) L / 65 guns and ten 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns . The ship was also armed with two submerged 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . The ship 's main belt was 270 mm ( 10 @.@ 6 in ) thick and the main battery was protected by up to 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) of armor . The conning tower also had 300 mm thick sides . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 During the war 75 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns were installed on the roofs of the ship 's two forward 240 mm gun turrets . During 1918 , the mainmast was shortened to allow the ship to fly a captive kite balloon and the elevation of the 240 mm guns was increased which extended their range to 18 @,@ 000 meters ( 20 @,@ 000 yd ) .

 Construction of Condorcet was begun on 26 December 1906 by Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire in Saint @-@ Nazaire and the ship was laid down on 23 August 1907 . She was launched on 20 April 1909 and was completed on 25 July 1911 . Condorcet was initially assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron ( escadre ) of the Mediterranean Fleet when she was commissioned . The ship participated in combined fleet maneuvers between Provence and Tunisia in May – June 1913 and the subsequent naval review conducted by the President of France , Raymond Poincaré on 7 June 1913 . Afterwards , Condorcet joined her squadron in its tour of the Eastern Mediterranean in October – December 1913 and participated in the grand fleet exercise in the Mediterranean in May 1914 . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 At the beginning of the war , the ship , together with her sister Vergniaud and the dreadnought Courbet , unsuccessfully searched for the German battlecruiser Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau in the Balearic Islands . On 9 August , Condorcet cruised the Strait of Sicily in an attempt to prevent the German ships from breaking out to the West . On 16 August 1914 the combined Anglo @-@ French Fleet under Admiral Auguste Boué de Lapeyrère , including Condorcet , made a sweep of the Adriatic Sea . The Allied ships encountered the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruiser SMS Zenta , escorted by the destroyer SMS Ulan , blockading the coast of Montenegro . There were too many ships for Zenta to escape , so she remained behind to allow Ulan to get away and was sunk by gunfire during the Battle of Antivari off the coast of Bar , Montenegro . Condorcet subsequently participated in a number of raids into the Adriatic later in the year and patrolled the Ionian Islands . From December 1914 to 1916 , the ship participated in the distant blockade of the Straits of Otranto while based in Corfu . On 1 December 1916 , Condorcet was in Athens and contributed troops to the Allied attempt to ensure Greek acquiescence to Allied operations in Macedonia . Shortly afterwards , she was transferred to Mudros to prevent Goeben from breaking out into the Mediterranean and remained there until September 1917 . The ship was transferred to the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron in May 1918 and returned to Mudros where she remained for the rest of the war . 
 = = = Postwar career = = = 
 From 6 December 1918 to 2 March 1919 , Condorcet represented France in the Allied squadron in Fiume that supervised the settlement of the Yugoslav question . Afterwards , the ship was assigned to the Channel Division of the French Navy . She was modernized in 1923 – 24 to improve her underwater protection and her four aft 75 mm guns were removed . Together with her sisters Diderot and Voltaire , she was assigned to the Training Division at Toulon . Condorcet housed the torpedo and electrical schools and had a torpedo tube fitted on the port side of her quarterdeck . She was partially disarmed in 1931 and converted into an accommodation hulk ; by 1939 her propellers had been removed . The famous underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau began diving while stationed aboard the ship in 1936 . 
 In April 1941 , the ship was towed to sea to evaluate the propellant used by the battleship Richelieu during the Battle of Dakar on 24 September 1940 . One 38 @-@ centimetre ( 15 in ) gun had an explosion in the breech and the propellant for the shell was thought to be the cause . A number of shots were successfully fired from Condorcet 's aft turret by remote control that exonerated the propellant . The following July , the ship was modified to house the signal , radio and electrician 's schools . Berthing areas were installed in the bases of four funnels , which had been removed previously , and the latest radio equipment was installed for the students to train on . Later that year , Condorcet was accidentally rammed by the submarine Le Glorieux as she was leaving drydock . The impact punctured the ship 's hull and flooded one compartment which required Condorcet to be drydocked for repairs . The ship was captured intact by the Germans when they occupied Vichy France on 27 November 1942 . Unlike the bulk of the French Fleet in Toulon , Condorcet was not scuttled because she had trainees aboard . Used by the Germans as a barracks ship , she was badly damaged by Allied aircraft in August 1944 and scuttled that same month by the Germans . The ship was salvaged in September 1945 and listed for sale on 14 December . Condorcet 's breaking up was completed about 1949 .

 Decapitated is a Polish death metal band formed in Krosno in 1996 . The group comprises guitarist , founder and composer Wacław " Vogg " Kiełtyka , vocalist Rafał Piotrowski , bassist Paweł <unk> , and drummer Michał <unk> . Decapitated have gained recognition as one of the genre 's most widely respected bands and one of the finest exponents of technical death metal . The band earned an international fan base in the underground music community , and became an innovating act in the modern death metal genre . 
 Vogg and his younger brother , drummer Witold " Vitek " Kiełtyka , founded Decapitated along with vocalist Wojciech " Sauron " <unk> in their mid @-@ teens , joined by bassist Marcin " Martin " Rygiel a year later . After releasing two demos , the band signed with Wicked World ( subsidiary of Earache Records ) and , in 2000 , released their debut album , Winds of Creation . In 2002 and 2004 the band released the albums Nihility and The Negation , respectively . The band 's ambitious fourth album , Organic Hallucinosis , was released in 2006 with a new vocalist , Adrian " Covan " <unk> . 
 In late 2007 , the band was involved in an automobile accident . Vitek died at the age of 23 on November 2 , 2007 of the injuries he suffered from the accident and Covan survived , but he slipped into a coma as a result . After a period of disbandment , Vogg reformed Decapitated and in 2011 released the fifth album , Carnival Is Forever . The latest album , Blood Mantra , was released in 2014 .

 Decapitated was founded in Krosno , Poland in 1996 , by guitarist Wacław " Vogg " Kiełtyka , who was 15 at the time , his brother drummer Witold " Vitek " Kiełtyka , who was 12 years old , and vocalist Wojciech " Sauron " <unk> , who was 16 . One year later , bassist Marcin " Martin " Rygiel , 13 , joined the band . Decapitated released its first demo , <unk> Gardens , in 1997 and its second demo , The Eye of Horus , in 1998 . After signing to Earache Records subsidiary Wicked World , the band released its debut album , Winds of Creation , which included a cover version of Slayer 's " Mandatory Suicide " , and was produced by Piotr <unk> from the Polish band Vader , in April 2000 . The band toured with Vader in early 2001 in the United Kingdom . Allmusic states that " Decapitated have quickly gained recognition as one of Poland 's , and even Europe 's , finest exponents of ultra @-@ technical death metal . " 
 Decapitated 's self @-@ produced second album , Nihility , which was released in February 2002 , fulfilled the high expectations that followed the well @-@ received debut album . Nihility also included a cover version of Napalm Death 's " Suffer the Children " . Decapitated was chosen to perform at the Polish Ozzfest event in late May and toured in North America and Europe in August . Sławek and Wojtek <unk> produced the band 's next album , The Negation , which was released in February 2004 . The album received a positive response from the critics and was followed by a tour in Europe and the United States throughout 2004 .

 In mid @-@ 2005 , Sauron announced his withdrawal from Decapitated , stating : " It was not an easy decision . However , I could reconcile the welfare of the band with my personal plans , and hence quitting appeared to be the best solution not hampering the evolution of Decapitated . ( ... ) Moreover , another reason that contributed to my decision have been some health complications . " The band chose Adrian " Covan " <unk> , a previous member of <unk> Red Sun , as his replacement and entered Hertz Studios in Białystok in August to record their ambitious fourth album Organic Hallucinosis , which was released the following February . According to Allmusic , the band 's musical change of direction on this album was " likely to polarize longtime Decapitated fans " . 
 During the following tour in December 2005 , Martin could not perform with the band due to military conscription issues and was shortly substituted by Richard <unk> , but joined again in February 2006 . During the year , Decapitated toured with American bands Suffocation , Six Feet Under , Fear Factory , and others . In June and July 2007 , Decapitated played with Cephalic Carnage and others in the Summer Slaughter trek across the US . Later on , Martin departed from Decapitated to live with his family and to move to California . 
 On October 28 , 2007 the band members were involved in an automobile accident that injured Vitek and Covan . Their tour bus collided with a truck carrying wood in Gomel , near the border from Russia to Belarus . Vitek died on November 2 , 2007 at the age of 23 in a Russian hospital from the injuries . Covan slipped into a coma and was later moved to Poland . In 2008 , Metal Mind Productions released the concert DVD Human 's Dust .

 On March 8 , 2009 , after a period of disbandment , Vogg announced he was planning to continue the band and was searching for a new drummer and vocalist . Covan was unable to continue with Decapitated due to the slow improvement of his condition . In early 2009 , Vogg participated on recording of the guitars for Vader 's album Necropolis and continued with the band on a tour in support of the album , starting in September . 
 In mid @-@ 2009 Vogg stated : " It has been the hardest thing for me to move on without Vitek by my side , but he would have wanted me to continue with the band . Finally , I have found some great musicians who can continue the work of Vitek and Covan . " " There 's no sense in stopping this amazing thing we built up so many years ago together with Vitek , Sauron , Martin and Covan . " 
 On July 31 , 2009 , the Austrian drummer Kerim " <unk> " Lechner of Thorns of Ivy joined Decapitated . On November 20 , 2009 , the new line @-@ up was completed with the vocalist Rafał Piotrowski of the band <unk> and bassist Filip " Heinrich " <unk> of <unk> and <unk> . Decapitated continued with support of Nuclear Blast record label and Hard Impact Music management . The band toured in United Kingdom in February 2010 as well as in April and May in Australia , New Zealand and European festivals and the Summer Slaughter tour in United States in mid @-@ 2010 . 
 The band entered RG Studio in Gdańsk on February 9 , to begin recording their fifth studio album entitled Carnival Is Forever . The album was produced by Vogg ; while mixing and drums production was done by Swedish producer Daniel <unk> , who previously worked with Behemoth and Meshuggah among others . Heinrich departed from Decapitated after the recording in order to concentrate on <unk> , and Carnival Is Forever was released on July 12 , 2011 . 
 On November 1 , 2011 , the band was on board LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16 when the crew were unable to extend the landing gear and were forced to land the aircraft on its belly . Everyone aboard the flight survived . Lechner left the band in September 2012 and was replaced by former Vader drummer Paweł <unk> .

 Decapitated 's music is composed by the " mastermind " of the band , Vogg , who co @-@ worked with Vitek while writing prior to his death . Decapitated became known for its songwriting and technical instrumental approach at an extraordinarily young age and earned an international fan base in the underground music community . In the review of Decapitated 's debut album , Allmusic said " the band has a seemingly effortless understanding and command of ... their instruments and ... the songwriting is extremely solid ; even in the first listen .

 = Oceanic whitetip shark = 
 The Oceanic whitetip shark ( Carcharhinus longimanus ) , also known as Brown Milbert 's sand bar shark , Brown shark , <unk> shark , Oceanic white @-@ tipped whaler , and Silvertip shark , is a large pelagic requiem shark inhabiting tropical and warm temperate seas . Its stocky body is most notable for its long , white @-@ tipped , rounded fins . 
 This aggressive but slow @-@ moving fish dominates feeding frenzies , and is a danger to shipwreck or air crash survivors . Recent studies show steeply declining populations because its large fins are highly valued as the chief ingredient of shark fin soup and , as with other shark species , the whitetip faces mounting fishing pressure throughout its range . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The oceanic whitetip shark , or lesser white shark was described in 1831 by naturalist René @-@ Primevère Lesson , who named the shark Carcharhinus <unk> . It was next described by Cuban Felipe Poey in 1861 as Squalus longimanus . The name <unk> longimanus has also been used . The species epithet longimanus refers to the size of its pectoral fins ( longimanus translates from Latin as " long hands " ) . The oceanic whitetip shark has many common names in English : Brown Milbert 's sand bar shark , brown shark , <unk> shark , whitetip whaler , and whitetip shark . 
 The rules of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature are that in general the first @-@ published description has priority ; therefore the valid scientific name for the oceanic whitetip shark should be Carcharhinus <unk> . However , Lesson 's name remained forgotten for so long that Carcharhinus longimanus remains widely accepted . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The oceanic whitetip is found globally in deep , open water , with a temperature greater than 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) . It prefers waters between 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) and 28 ° C ( 82 ° F ) and tends to withdraw from areas when temperatures fall outside of this . They were once extremely common and widely distributed , and still inhabit a wide band around the globe ; however , recent studies suggest that their numbers have drastically declined . An analysis of the US pelagic longline logbook data between 1992 – 2000 ( covering the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic ) estimated a decline of 70 % over that period . 
 They are found worldwide between 45 ° north and 43 ° south latitude . In 2004 , an oceanic whitetip was discovered dead on the west coast of Sweden — far beyond what was once considered the northern boundary of its range . 
 The shark spends most of its time in the upper layer of the ocean — to a depth of 150 metres ( 490 ft ) — and prefers off @-@ shore , deep @-@ ocean areas . According to longline capture data , increasing distance from land correlates to a greater population of sharks . Occasionally it is found close to land , in waters as shallow as 37 metres ( 120 ft ) , mainly around mid @-@ ocean islands such as Hawaii , or in areas where the continental shelf is narrow and there is access to nearby deep water . It is typically solitary , though gatherings have been observed where food is plentiful . Unlike many animals , it does not have a diurnal cycle , and is active both day and night . Its swimming style is slow , with widely spread pectoral fins . Despite their habitual isolation from members of their own species , pilot fish , dolphinfish , and remora may accompany them . In 1988 , Jeremy Stafford @-@ <unk> reported seeing an individual accompanied by a shortfin pilot whale . 
 = = Description = = 
 C. longimanus ' most distinguishing characteristics are its long , wing @-@ like pectoral and dorsal fins . The fins are significantly larger than most other shark species , and are conspicuously rounded . The shark 's nose is rounded and its eyes are circular , with nictitating membranes . 
 C. longimanus has a ' typical ' , although somewhat flattened requiem shark body , often with a mildly humpbacked aspect . It is bronze , brown , bluish or grey dorsally ( the colour varies by region ) , and white ventrally ( although it may occasionally have a yellow tint ) . The oceanic whitetip shark is a medium @-@ sized requiem shark . The largest specimen ever caught measured 4 m ( 13 ft ) , an exceptionally large size considering few specimens are known to exceed a length of 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) . The maximum reported weight is 170 kg ( 370 lb ) . The female is typically larger than the male by 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) . Males attain sexual maturity at 1 @.@ 7 to 1 @.@ 9 m ( 5 @.@ 6 to 6 @.@ 2 ft ) and females about 1 @.@ 8 to 2 m ( 5 @.@ 9 to 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . In the Gulf of Mexico in the 1950s , the mean weight of oceanic whitetip sharks was 86 @.@ 4 kg ( 190 lb ) . In the 1990s , the sharks of the species from the same area averaged only 56 @.@ 1 kg ( 124 lb ) . 
 Most of its fins ( dorsal , pectoral , pelvic , and caudal ) have white tips ( juvenile specimens and some adults may lack these ) . Along with white tips , the fins may be mottled , and in young specimens can have black marks . A saddle @-@ like marking may be apparent between first and second dorsal fins . The shark has several kinds of teeth . Those in the mandible ( lower jaw ) have a thin serrated tip and are relatively small and triangular ( somewhat fang @-@ like ) . There are between 13 and 15 teeth on either side of the symphysis . The teeth in the upper jaw are triangular , but much larger and broader with entirely serrated edges — there are 14 or 15 along each side of the symphysis . The denticles lie flat and typically have between five and seven ridges . 
 = = Diet = = 
 C. longimanus feeds mainly on pelagic cephalopods and bony fish . However , its diet can be far more varied and less selective — it is known to eat threadfins , stingrays , sea turtles , birds , gastropods , crustaceans , and mammalian carrion . The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish , oarfish , barracuda , jacks , dolphinfish , marlin , tuna , and mackerel . Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth . When feeding with other species , it becomes aggressive . Peter Benchley , author of Jaws , observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 The oceanic whitetip is usually solitary and slow @-@ moving , and tends to cruise near the top of the water column , covering vast stretches of empty water scanning for possible food sources . Until the 16th century , sharks were known to mariners as " sea dogs " and the oceanic whitetip , the most common ship @-@ following shark , exhibits dog @-@ like behaviour when its interest is piqued : when attracted to something that appears to be food , its movements become more avid and it will approach cautiously but stubbornly , retreating and maintaining a safe distance if driven off , but ready to rush in if the opportunity presents itself . Oceanic whitetips are not fast swimmers , but they are capable of surprising bursts of speed . <unk> commonly compete for food with silky sharks , making up for its comparatively leisurely swimming style with aggressive displays . 
 Groups often form when individuals converge on a food source , whereupon a feeding frenzy may occur . This seems to be triggered not by blood in the water or by bloodlust , but by the species ' highly strung and goal @-@ directed nature ( conserving energy between infrequent feeding opportunities when it is not slowly plying the open ocean ) . The oceanic whitetip is a competitive , opportunistic predator that exploits the resource at hand , rather than avoiding trouble in favour of a possibly easier future meal . 
 There does not seem to be segregation by sex and size . <unk> follow schools of tuna or squid , and trail groups of cetaceans such as dolphins and pilot whales , scavenging their prey . Their instinct is to follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean @-@ going ships . When whaling took place in warm waters , oceanic whitetips were often responsible for much of the damage to floating carcasses . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 Mating season is in early summer in the northwest Atlantic Ocean and southwest Indian Ocean , although females captured in the Pacific have been found with embryos year round , suggesting a longer mating season there . The shark is viviparous — embryos develop in utero and are fed by a placental sac . Its gestation period is one year . Litter sizes vary from one to 15 with the young born at a length of about 0 @.@ 6 metres ( 24 in ) . Sexual maturity is reached at close to 1 @.@ 75 metres ( 69 in ) for males and 2 metres ( 80 in ) for females . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 The oceanic whitetip is a commercially important species for its fins , meat , and oil . It is eaten fresh , smoked , dried , and salted and its hide is used for leather . It is subject to fishing pressure throughout virtually its whole range — although it is more often taken as by @-@ catch than by design , since it is drawn to longline bait that is intended for other species . 
 Famed oceanographic researcher Jacques Cousteau described the oceanic whitetip as " the most dangerous of all sharks " . Despite the greater notoriety of the great white shark and other sharks habitually found nearer the shore , the oceanic whitetip is suspected to be responsible for many fatal shark bites on humans , as a result of predation on survivors of shipwrecks or downed aircraft . Such incidents are not included in common shark @-@ bite indices for the 20th and 21st centuries , and as a result of this , the oceanic whitetip does not have the highest number of recorded incidents ; only 5 recorded bites as of 2009 . In one incident , the torpedoing of USS Indianapolis on 30 July 1945 , oceanic whitetips are believed to be responsible for many of the fatal bites of sailors who survived the initial sinking , though most reportedly died from exposure to the elements rather than from shark bites . 
 Also during World War II , the Nova Scotia , a steamship carrying approximately 1 @,@ 000 people near South Africa , was sunk by a German submarine . With only 192 survivors , many deaths were attributed to the whitetip . 
 One particularly infamous oceanic whitetip was implicated in several bites on tourists in the Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh , Egypt in 2010 , and was featured in a Shark Week episode called " Rogue Sharks " . This oceanic whitetip was recognized individually by the bite mark taken out of its upper tail lobe . Accumulating evidence revealed this shark to have been conditioned to being hand fed . Upon associating the divers with an easy supply of food , it bit the divers and snorkelers where it had seen the fish being kept ; fanny packs the divers carried . This caused the shark to target the divers ' buttock and thigh regions in the hope of obtaining a meal . These 2010 Sharm El Sheikh bites resulted in one death and four injuries to humans . The bites were further worsened by the overfishing in that area of the Red Sea , effectively forcing the shark closer to shore where the bites took place . 
 Dr. Christopher Neff , a policy analyst at the University of Sydney , argues that terms like " attack " are laden with cultural stigmatization . Instead of the word " attack , " he proposes labeling human @-@ shark interactions , on a scale of extremity , either : 
 encounters 
 minor bites 
 moderate bites 
 fatal bites 
 The term " attack " is only appropriate in specific instances where specialists can confirm the predatory nature of the shark @-@ human encounter , which is extremely difficult to do . While many encounters with Oceanic White Tip Sharks appear predatory in nature , without the verification of a scientific community in each instance , it is best to assume the accidental or non @-@ predatory intent of the encounters . 
 = = Captivity = = 
 The oceanic whitetip has fared better in captivity than other large sharks of the open ocean , such as the mako and blue shark . Among five recorded captive oceanic whitetips , the three with time records all lived for more than a year in captivity . One of these , a female in Monterey Bay Aquarium 's Outer @-@ Bay exhibit , lived for more than three years during which it grew 0 @.@ 3 m ( 1 ft ) . The two remaining lack a time record , but grew about 0 @.@ 5 m ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) during their time in captivity . The Monterey Bay oceanic whitetip was featured briefly in the Shark Week special " Sharks Under Glass " . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 In 1969 , <unk> and Backus wrote of the oceanic whitetip : " [ it is ] extraordinarily abundant , perhaps the most abundant large animal , large being over 100 pounds [ 45 kg ] , on the face of the earth " . There was little further population study until 2003 when the numbers were estimated to have dropped by as much as 70 % in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic between 1992 and 2000 . Another study focusing on the Gulf of Mexico , using a mix of data from US pelagic longline surveys from the mid @-@ 1950s and observations from the late @-@ 1990s , estimated a decline in numbers in this location of 99 @.@ 3 % over this period . However , changes in fishing practices and data collection methods complicate estimates . 
 As a result of these findings its status on the IUCN Red List was moved to " Vulnerable " globally ( from " Lower Risk / Near Threatened " ) and " Critically Endangered " in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic areas . 
 Under the 1995 UN Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks ( <unk> ) , coastal and fishing states are specifically required to adopt measures to conserve listed species , but little progress is visible on the oceanic whitetip . 
 From 3 January 2013 the shark was fully protected in New Zealand territorial waters under the Wildlife Act 1953 . 
 In March 2013 , three endangered commercially valuable sharks , the hammerheads , the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to Appendix 2 of CITES , bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation . 
 = Youngstown Ohio Works = 
 The Youngstown Ohio Works baseball team was a minor league club that was known for winning the premier championship of the Ohio – Pennsylvania League in 1905 , and for launching the professional career of pitcher Roy Castleton a year later . A training ground for several players and officials who later established careers in Major League Baseball , the team proved a formidable regional competitor and also won the 1906 league championship . 
 During its brief span of activity , the Ohio Works team faced challenges that reflected common difficulties within the Ohio – Pennsylvania League , including weak financial support for teams . Following a dispute over funding , the team 's owners sold the club to outside investors , just a few months before the opening of the 1907 season . 
 The club 's strong record and regional visibility spurred the growth of amateur and minor league baseball in the Youngstown area , and the community 's minor league teams produced notable players throughout the first half of the 20th century . In the late 1990s , this tradition was rekindled , with the establishment of the Mahoning Valley Scrappers , a minor league team based in neighboring Niles , Ohio . 
 = = Formation and league championship = = 
 The Ohio Works team was organized in Youngstown , in 1902 , under the sponsorship of Joseph A. McDonald , superintendent of the Ohio Works of the Carnegie Steel Company . In 1905 , the club joined the Class C Division , Ohio – Pennsylvania League , which was founded that year in Akron , Ohio , by veteran ballplayer Charlie Morton . The league 's Ohio members included clubs from Akron , Barberton , Bucyrus , Canton , Kent , Lima , Massillon , Mount Vernon , Newark , Niles , Steubenville , Washington , Wooster , Youngstown , and Zanesville , while Pennsylvania was initially represented by teams from Braddock , Butler , Homestead , and Sharon . Within the first two weeks of the season , clubs from Lancaster and McKeesport also joined the league . Only eight of the original 21 participating clubs finished the 1905 season , however . These included clubs from Akron , Homestead , Lancaster , Newark , Niles , Sharon , Youngstown , and Zanesville . The name , " Youngstown Ohio Works " , became officially associated with the Youngstown team when it joined the Ohio – Pennsylvania League . From the outset , the Youngstown ball club was managed by ex @-@ major leaguer Marty Hogan , a former outfielder for the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Browns . 
 The team opened the 1905 season with an unexpected 4 – 1 loss to the Canton <unk> , inspiring a local newspaper to comment that the Youngstown team made " as many errors as hits while Canton fielded almost perfectly and hit <unk> " . The Ohio Works club gained steam , however , and began to win games . On May 11 , 1905 , the Youngstown team garnered controversy when The Akron Times @-@ Democrat reported that the Ohio Works ' sponsors provided player salaries that nearly doubled those offered by other clubs in the Ohio – Pennsylvania League . In a report on the outcry in Akron , The Youngstown Daily Vindicator warned that , " if the Youngstown backers keep adding and force the other clubs to add to the salaries , it is a question of only a short time until independent baseball will be an impossibility " . The newspaper article concluded that the large salaries provided by the Ohio Works 's sponsors placed a special burden on teams based in " smaller cities " . 
 Competition among league participants was intense , and games were often raucous affairs . On July 16 , 1905 , a riot broke out during a contest with a team in neighboring Niles , Ohio . According to a newspaper account , the trouble began when two female fans became involved in a " hair @-@ pulling fight " . At one point , two " well @-@ known men " were arrested for " taking an umbrella from a woman and breaking it after she had been annoying them with it " . Finally , dozens of fans swarmed into the field , where they " pushed around the umpire and interfered with the defensive play of the Youngstown fielders " . 
 In September 1905 , the Youngstown Ohio Works won the first league championship , though sources disagree on the club 's final record . This confusion may be due to the disorganized nature of the new league , with its sprawling roster of teams . According to the Spalding Guide ( 1906 ) , " The failure to furnish official reports was probably due to the clubs being new to a league " . Baseball researcher Jim Holl summarizes the varied accounts as follows : " The Reach Guide ( 1906 ) credits Youngstown with an 84 – 32 won – lost record where the Spalding Guide of the same year list a 90 – 35 record . The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball ( 1993 ) tells a third story , giving Youngstown an 88 – 35 mark " . Despite this uncertainty over the club 's record , its championship status was not in dispute , and the team became popularly known as " the Champs " . This moniker , however , was not officially connected to a Youngstown @-@ based ball club until 1907 , when it became the legal name of the Ohio Works ' local successors . 
 = = Final season = = 
 By the outset of the 1906 season , the Ohio – Pennsylvania League had trimmed down to a more manageable eight teams . Departing teams included franchises from Barberton , Braddock , Bucyrus , Butler , Canton , Homestead , Kent , Lima , Massillon , McKeesport , Mount Vernon , Niles , Steubenville , Washington , and Wooster . At the same time , the league attracted new teams from New Castle , Pennsylvania , and Mansfield , Ohio . 
 The Ohio Works team opened with 16 players , three of whom had been part of the club during the 1905 season . The team 's lineup included William J. Maloney of Bradford , Kentucky ; Will M. Thomas of Morristown , Pennsylvania ; Tommy Thomas of Piqua , Ohio ; Lee Fohl of Allegheny , Pennsylvania ; Louis Schettler of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania ; " Dotty " Freck of Columbus , Ohio ; A. C. McClintock of Columbus ; Roy Castleton of Salt Lake City , Utah ; Lewis Groh of Rochester , New York ; John Kennedy of Youngstown , Charles Crouse of Detroit , Michigan ; Roy Chase of Andover , Ohio ; Forrester J. <unk> of Garrettsville , Pennsylvania ; Harry Schwartz of Cleveland , Ohio ; and Roy Gould of Middlesex , Pennsylvania . Other players associated with the club during the 1906 season were Edward <unk> , Curley Blount , and Charles McCloskey . 
 The Youngstown club kicked off the 1906 season with an exhibition game against a Cleveland team , emerging as victors in a close contest of 3 – 4 . " Up till the closing minutes it looked like the visiting team , the Cleveland Leaders , would stow the contest away in their bat @-@ bags and leave the field on top " , the Vindicator reported . " The finish was exciting , and 400 fanatics who took chances on pneumonia had a chance to warm up and go home in good spirits . " . The paper stated that , at the top of the first inning , the Cleveland team was leading by one point , when " the Youngstown gentlemen got busy in the most approved style " . According to the Vindicator , Ohio Works player Curley Blount " stepped in front of a slow pitched ball and was sent to third " , while A. C. McClintock " stole second with all hands asleep " . At this point , the paper added , " [ Charles ] McCloskey took another base hit and Blount and McClintock scored " . The Vindicator 's summary of the game called attention to pitcher Roy Castleton , " who struck out all three batters in the tenth and got one in the ninth " . The paper described McClintock and McCloskey ( the " two Macs " ) as the Youngstown club 's " star hitters " . 
 Early in the season , as the Ohio Works team prepared for a second game with the Zanesville Moguls ( close rivals in the 1905 championship games ) , the club manager , Hogan , spoke confidently on their chances of capturing the league pennant . " If the boys go through the season as they are playing now , we will have no trouble winning out " , he said to a reporter with The Youngstown Daily Vindicator . " Our pitchers are in good condition and are holding the opposing batsmen to few hits . It is the pitching staff that has saved many a game for us . We have no .350 batters on the club , but any man on it is liable to step in and break up a game " . A local newspaper confirmed Hogan 's assessment of the team , observing that only one player , outfielder Will Thomas , had worked up a batting average of .306 . Nevertheless , as Hogan predicted , the team defeated the Moguls , with a final score of 11 – 8 . The game 's highlights included the pitching of " Long John " Kennedy , who kept the Moguls to seven hits , and the batting of Edward <unk> , who " <unk> a drive to middle field that permitted him to go all the way around " . 
 Hogan 's overall confidence in the club was rewarded . The Youngstown team closed the season with an 84 – 53 record and won its second consecutive Ohio – Pennsylvania League championship . The star of the Ohio Works team was a <unk> , left @-@ handed pitcher named Roy Castleton , a Utah native who went on to pitch for the New York Highlanders and Cincinnati Reds . On August 17 , 1906 , Castleton gained national recognition when he pitched a perfect game against rival Akron , shutting them out at 4 – 0 . With Castleton 's assistance , the Youngstown Ohio Works claimed its third consecutive Ohio state pennant , a prize distinct from the league championship . 
 = = Dissolution = = 
 In the wake of the Ohio Works ' second league championship , steps were taken to incorporate the club . Sporting Life noted in December 1906 that the team 's backers , Joseph and Thomas McDonald ( superintendent and assistant superintendent , respectively , of the Ohio Works of the Carnegie Steel Company ) were compelled to invite additional investors because of planned ( and costly ) improvements at the steel plant . " The incorporators of the club will be Thomas McDonald , Joseph McDonald , Thomas Carr , Thomas Carter and Marty Hogan " , the paper stated . " Manager Hogan will be given even more control of the team next season than he has had . Heretofore he has had the entire control of the team and transacted most of the business " . 
 At some point , however , disagreements over funding evidently arose between the McDonald brothers and Hogan . On February 18 , 1907 , the Zanesville Signal reported that Hogan had received permission from " the Messrs. McDonald " ( Joseph and Thomas ) to negotiate a $ 3 @,@ 000 deal for the sale of the team , including its players , to a group of Zanesville investors . The following day , Hogan was quoted as saying , " Youngstown couldn 't or didn 't raise enough money to cover a sparrow 's blanket " . The ball club manager 's evident frustration during this period was reflected in comments published in The Youngstown Daily Vindicator almost a week after the team 's sale . When questioned on his widely publicized decision to resign as manager of the Youngstown club before the opening of the 1907 season , Hogan reportedly said that he had received " the short end of the deal " . No reference was made to the club 's sale . 
 The former Ohio Works manager was apparently not the only observer to suggest that Joseph McDonald engaged in " unsportsmanlike tactics " . A feature story , that appeared in The Youngstown Daily Vindicator in 1920 , stated that McDonald took deliberate steps in 1907 to replace the Ohio Works team with a more seasoned club from Homestead , Pennsylvania . The new club became known officially as the " Youngstown Champs " . Rumors of McDonald 's supposed strategy apparently angered local baseball fans . According to the 1920 feature article , the Youngstown media highlighted the Champs ' unexpected loss to the amateur Rayen Athletics in 1907 . At this point , however , McDonald 's relationship with the club was less direct . According to Sporting Life , the Youngstown franchise had been " declared forfeit " in early 1907 , on the recommendation of the Akron club ; it was subsequently " awarded " to a recently established baseball company . " This was only a formality to make legal the actions taken by Magnate [ Joseph ] McDonald when they turned over the old franchise to the newly organized company in Youngstown " , the paper reported . In any event , the Youngstown Champs went on to win the Ohio – Pennsylvania League championship . 
 Meanwhile , former Ohio Works players in Zanesville quickly regained their momentum . In March 1907 , the new club was admitted into the Pennsylvania – Ohio – Maryland League , a Division D league . By the close of the 1907 season , the club had seized the championship of the eight @-@ team P @-@ O @-@ M league . In 1908 , Hogan 's final season as manager , the team was christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League . Further research is needed to determine the Zanesville Infants ' league ranking at the close of the 1908 season , but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner @-@ up . 
 With the exception of a few notable figures , the progress of former Ohio Works players is difficult to track . After leaving the club at the end of the 1906 season , Roy Castleton went on to pitch for the New York Highlanders and Cincinnati Reds . Lee Fohl , another noteworthy alumnus , managed the Cleveland Indians between 1915 and 1919 . Fohl later served as manager of the St. Louis Browns and Boston Red Sox . Although Fohl was often criticized as a manager , sports journalist John J. Ward ( writing in August 1924 ) credited him , to a large extent , for the early successes of the Red Sox , an underdog that briefly challenged the New York Yankees and Washington Senators before slipping to seventh place in the eight @-@ team American League . Former major leaguer Billy Phyle , who played for the Ohio Works team during the 1905 season , went on to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1906 . A fourth ex @-@ team member , Louis Schettler , played for the Philadelphia Phillies during the 1910 season . Schettler ( a Pittsburgh native ) eventually settled in Youngstown , where he died in 1960 . 
 Much is known about the subsequent career of the team 's ex @-@ manager . In 1909 , Marty Hogan moved to Lancaster , Pennsylvania , where he signed future Hall of Fame pitcher Stan Coveleski to his first professional contract . In 1909 , the Lancaster Red Roses worked up a 75 @-@ 39 record , seizing the championship of the Tri @-@ State League . As Spalding 's Baseball Guide ( 1910 ) reported : " Lancaster , under manager Marty Hogan , won its first pennant in the league , and the top rung of the ladder was only gained by the hardest kind of fighting " . Hogan went on to manage clubs in Zanesville and Fond du Lac , Wisconsin . In 1913 , during a stint in Zanesville , the manager signed pitcher Sam Jones to his first professional contract . In the mid @-@ 1910s , Hogan permanently resettled in Youngstown , where he died in 1923 , several months after being injured in an automobile accident . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Youngstown Ohio Works team not only gave several members a " shot " at the major leagues , but it also played an indirect role in launching the career of Hall of Fame umpire Billy Evans . On September 1 , 1903 , Evans , a reporter at The Youngstown Daily Vindicator , was assigned to cover a game between the Ohio Works and the Homestead Library Athletic Club that was held in Youngstown . Evans took his first step toward a legendary career when club manager Hogan offered him $ 15 to fill an umpire vacancy . ( In 1905 , Evans received a major career boost from Youngstown native Jimmy McAleer , who recommended Evans to the American League . ) 
 The story of the Ohio Works team proved to be an early chapter in Youngstown 's long history of amateur and minor league baseball . In the 1930s and 1940s , the city was a frequent host of the National Amateur Baseball Federation ( <unk> ) championship . <unk> officials praised the community for the condition of its sandlot baseball diamonds , which they rated as among the best in the country . During the first half of the 20th century , Youngstown @-@ based teams provided experience and exposure to future major league players such as Everett Scott , Floyd Baker , and Johnny <unk> . Today , the Youngstown – Warren area is home base to the Mahoning Valley Scrappers , a minor league team that competes in the Class A New York – Penn League .

 The Dutch Pacification Campaign on Formosa was a series of military actions and diplomatic moves undertaken in 1635 and 1636 by Dutch colonial authorities in Dutch @-@ era Taiwan ( Formosa ) aimed at subduing hostile aboriginal villages in the southwestern region of the island . Prior to the campaign the Dutch had been in Formosa for eleven years , but did not control much of the island beyond their principal fortress at Tayouan , and an alliance with the town of Sinkan . The other aboriginal villages in the area conducted numerous attacks on the Dutch and their allies , with the chief belligerents being the village of Mattau , who in 1629 ambushed and slaughtered a group of sixty Dutch soldiers . 
 After receiving reinforcements from the colonial headquarters at Batavia , the Dutch launched an attack in 1635 and were able to crush opposition and bring the area around present @-@ day Tainan fully under their control . After seeing Mattau and Soulang , the most powerful villages in the area , defeated so comprehensively , many other villages in the surrounding area came to the Dutch to seek peace and surrender sovereignty . Thus the Dutch were able to dramatically expand the extent of their territorial control in a short time , and avoid the need for further fighting . The campaign ended in February 1636 , when representatives from twenty @-@ eight villages attended a ceremony in Tayouan to cement Dutch sovereignty . 
 <unk> the southwest under their rule , the Dutch were able to expand their operations from the limited entrepôt trading carried out by the colony prior to 1635 . The expanded territory allowed access to the deer trade , which later became very lucrative , and guaranteed security in food supplies . It provided fertile land , which the Dutch used imported Chinese labour to farm . The aboriginal villages also provided warriors to aid the Dutch in times of trouble , notably in the <unk> Island Massacre of 1636 , the Dutch defeat of the Spanish in 1642 and the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 . The allied villages also provided opportunities for Dutch missionaries to spread their faith . The pacification campaign is considered the foundation stone on which the later success of the colony was built . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Dutch East India Company ( VOC ) arrived in southern Formosa in 1624 and , after building their stronghold of Fort Zeelandia on the peninsula of Tayouan , began to sound out local villages as to the possibility of forming alliances . Although initially the intention was to run the colony solely as an entrepôt ( a trading port ) , the Dutch later decided that they needed control over the hinterland to provide some security . Additionally , a large percentage of supplies for the Dutch colonists had to be shipped from Batavia at great expense and irregular intervals , and the government of the fledgling colony was keen to source foodstuffs and other supplies locally . The Company decided to ally with the closest village , the relatively small Sinkan , who were able to supply them firewood , venison and fish . However , relations with the other villages were not so friendly . The aboriginal settlements of the area were involved in more or less constant low @-@ level warfare with each other ( head @-@ hunting raids and looting of property ) , and an alliance with Sinkan put the Dutch at odds with the foes of that village . In 1625 the Dutch bought a piece of land from the <unk> for the sum of fifteen <unk> ( a kind of cloth ) , where they then built the town of Sakam for Dutch and Chinese merchants . 
 Initially other villages in the area , chiefly Mattau , Soulang and Bakloan , also professed their desire to live in peace with the Dutch . The villages saw that it was in their interest to maintain good relations with the newcomers , but this belief was weakened by a series of incidents between 1625 and 1629 . The earliest of these was a Dutch attack on Chinese pirates in the bay of <unk> , not far from Mattau , in 1625 . The pirates were able to drive off the Dutch soldiers , causing the Dutch to lose face among the Formosan villages . Encouraged by this Dutch failure , warriors from Mattau raided Sinkan , believing the Dutch too weak to defend their Formosan friends . At this point , the Dutch returned to <unk> and this time were able to rout the pirates , restoring their reputation . Mattau was then forced by the colonials to return the property stolen from Sinkan and make reparations in the form of two pigs . The peace was short @-@ lived , however , because in November 1626 the villagers of Sinkan attacked Mattau and Bakloan , before going to the Dutch to ask for protection from retribution . Although the Dutch were able to force Sinkan 's enemies to back down in this case , in later incidents they proved incapable of fully protecting their Formosan allies . 
 Frustrated by the inability of the Dutch to protect them , the Sinkan villagers turned to Japanese traders , who were not on friendly terms with the VOC . In 1627 a delegation from the village visited Japan in order to ask for Japanese protection and to offer sovereignty to the Japanese Shōgun Tokugawa Iemitsu . The Shōgun refused them an audience , but on their return to Formosa the Sinkan villagers , along with their erstwhile foes from Mattau , Bakloan and Soulang , went to Governor Nuyts to demand that the company pay an annual tribute to the villages for operating on their land . The Governor refused . Soon after , the Japanese isolationist policy of <unk> removed Japanese support for the Formosans , leaving Sinkan once more at the mercy of its rivals , prompting missionary George <unk> to write that " this village Sinkan has been until now under Dutch protection , and without this protection it would not stand for even a month . " In 1629 however the Dutch were unable to defend either themselves or their allies . Governor Nuyts went to Mattau on an official ( friendly ) visit with a guard of sixty musketeers , who were fêted on their arrival . After leaving the village the next morning , the musketeers were ambushed while crossing a stream and slaughtered to a man , by warriors of both Mattau and Soulang . The Governor had a lucky escape as he had returned to Fort Zeelandia the previous evening . 
 Shortly after the massacre Governor Nuyts was recalled by the VOC governor @-@ general in Batavia for various offences , including responsibility for the souring of relations with the Japanese . Hans Putmans replaced Nuyts as governor , and immediately wanted to attack the ringleaders in Mattau , but the village was judged too strong to assault directly . Therefore , the Dutch moved against the weaker Bakloan , who they believed sheltered proponents of the massacre , setting out on 23 November 1629 , and returning later that day " having killed many people and burned most of the village . " The Bakloan villagers sued for peace , and Mattau too signed a nine @-@ month peace accord with the company . However , in the years that followed , the Mattau , Bakloan and Soulang villagers continued a concerted campaign to harass employees of the company , particularly those who were rebuilding structures destroyed by the <unk> in Sakam . The situation showed no signs of improvement for the Dutch , until relations between Mattau and Soulang soured in late 1633 and early 1634 . The two villages went to war in May 1634 , and although Mattau won the fight , the company was happy to see divisions among the villages which it felt it could exploit . 
 = = Dutch retaliation = = 
 Although both Governor Nuyts and subsequently Governor Putmans wanted to move against Mattau , the garrison at Fort Zeelandia numbered only 400 , of which 210 were soldiers – not enough to undertake a major campaign without leaving the Dutch fortress guard under @-@ strength . After persistent unheeded requests from the two governors , in 1635 Batavia finally sent a force of 475 soldiers to Taiwan , to " avenge the murder of the expeditionary force against Mattau in 1629 , to increase the prestige of the Company , and to obtain the respect and authority , necessary for the protection of the Chinese who had come all the way from China , to cultivate the land . " 
 By this stage , relations with the other villages had also deteriorated to the extent that even Sinkan , previously thought to be tightly bound to the Dutch , was plotting rebellion . The missionary Robert Junius , who lived among the natives , wrote that " rebels in Sinkan have conspired against our state . . . and [ are planning ] to murder and beat to death the missionaries and soldiers in Sinkan . " The governor in Tayouan moved quickly to quell the uprising , sending eighty soldiers to the village and arresting some of the key conspirators . With potential disaster averted in Sinkan , the Dutch were further encouraged by the news that Mattau and Soulang , their principal enemies , were being ravaged by smallpox , whereas Sinkan , now back under Dutch control , was spared the disease - this being viewed as a divine sign that the Dutch were righteous . 
 On 22 November 1635 , the newly arrived forces set out for Bakloan , headed by Governor Putmans . Junius joined him with a group of native warriors from Sinkan , who had been persuaded to take part by the clergyman in order to further good relations between themselves and the VOC . The plan was initially to rest there for the night , before attacking Mattau the next morning , but the Dutch forces received word that the Mattau villagers had learned of their approach and planned to flee . They therefore decided to press on and attack that evening , succeeding in surprising the Mattau warriors and subduing the village without a fight . The Dutch summarily executed 26 men of the village , before setting fire to the houses and returning to Bakloan . 
 On the way back to Fort Zeelandia , the troops stopped in Bakloan , Sinkan and Sakam , at each step warning the chiefs of the village of the price of angering the VOC , and obtaining guarantees of friendly conduct in the future . The village of Soulang sent two representatives to the Dutch while they were resting in Sinkan , offering a spear and a hatchet as a symbol that they would ally their forces to the Dutch . Also present with offers of friendship were men from <unk> , a collection of three villages in the hills previously outside Dutch influence . Finally two chiefs from Mattau arrived , <unk> @-@ towing to the Dutch officials and wishing to sue for peace . 
 The aborigines signalled their surrender by sending a few of their best weapons to the Dutch , and then by bringing a small tree ( often betel nut ) planted in earth from their village as a token of the granting of sovereignty to the VOC . Over the next few months as word of the Dutch victory spread , more and more villages came to pay their respects at Fort Zeelandia and assure the VOC of their friendly intentions . However , the new masters of Mattau also inherited their enemies , with both <unk> and <unk> expressing hostility towards the VOC in the wake of their victory . 
 After the victory over Mattau the governor decided to make use of the soldiers to cow other recalcitrant villages , starting with Taccariang , who had previously killed both VOC employees and Sinkan villagers . The villagers first fought with the <unk> who were acting as a vanguard , but on receiving a volley from the Dutch musketeers the Taccariang warriors turned and fled . The VOC forces entered the village unopposed , and burnt it to the ground . From Taccariang they moved on to Soulang , where they arrested warriors who had participated in the 1629 massacre of sixty Dutch soldiers and torched their houses . The last stop on the campaign trail was <unk> , which had previously sheltered wanted men from other villages . This time the governor decided to use diplomacy , offering gifts and assurances of friendship , with the consequences of resistance left implicit . The <unk> took the hint , and offered no opposition to Dutch rule . 
 = = Pax <unk> = = 
 On hearing of the Dutch show of force , aboriginal tribes from further afield decided to submit to Dutch rule , either through fear of Dutch military might or hope that such an alliance would prove beneficial to the tribe . Representatives came from <unk> ( <unk> ; modern @-@ day <unk> , Pingtung ) , 100 km to the south , to ally themselves with the VOC . The Dutch decided to hold a <unk> ( a grand convention ) to welcome all the villages into the fold and impress them with Dutch largesse and power . This duly took place on 22 February 1636 , with 28 villages represented from southern and central Formosa . The governor presented the attendees with robes and staffs of state to symbolise their position , and Robert Junius wrote that " it was delightful to see the friendliness of these people when they met for the first time , to notice how they kissed each other and gazed at one another . Such a thing had never before been witnessed in this country , as one tribe was nearly always waging war against another . " 
 The net effect of the Dutch campaign was a pax <unk> ( Dutch peace ) , assuring VOC control in the southwest of the island . The Dutch called their new area of control the <unk> <unk> ( United Villages ) , a deliberate allusion to the United Provinces of their homeland . The campaign was vital to the success and growth of the Dutch colony , which had operated as more of a trading post than a true colony until that point .

 = Brian Eaton = 
 Air Vice Marshal Brian Alexander Eaton , CB , CBE , DSO & Bar , DFC ( 15 December 1916 – 17 October 1992 ) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . Born in Tasmania and raised in Victoria , he joined the RAAF in 1936 and was promoted to flight lieutenant on the outbreak of World War II . He held training positions before being posted to No. 3 Squadron at the beginning of 1943 , flying P @-@ 40 Kittyhawk fighter @-@ bombers in North Africa . Despite being shot down three times within ten days soon after arriving , Eaton quickly rose to become the unit 's commanding officer , and by year 's end had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross . His leadership earned him the Distinguished Service Order and Bar in 1944 – 45 , and command of No. 239 Wing RAF in Italy , with the temporary rank of group captain . He was also awarded the US Silver Star in 1946 in recognition of his war service . 
 In the decade following World War II , Eaton led No. 81 Wing in Japan , and No. 78 Wing in Malta . He commanded RAAF Base Williamtown from 1957 to 1959 , after which he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire . As Director @-@ General of Operational Requirements in 1965 , Eaton argued for increased RAAF co @-@ operation with the Australian Army in light of growing involvement in the Vietnam War . He was promoted to air vice marshal the next year , and became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff . Posted to Singapore as Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) No. 224 Group RAF in 1967 , he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his work as chief of staff at Headquarters RAF Far East Air Force in 1969 . He then served as Air Member for Personnel , before being selected as AOC Operational Command in 1973 . Eaton retired from the RAAF in December that year , and became an executive for Rolls @-@ Royce in Canberra . He died in 1992 at the age of 75 .

 Brian Eaton was born in Launceston , Tasmania , on 15 December 1916 , to Sydney and Hilda Eaton . The family later moved to Canterbury , Victoria , and Brian was educated at Carey Grammar . His early ambition to be a doctor was curtailed when his father died and he had to leave school early . He enlisted as an air cadet in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) on 20 January 1936 , undergoing flying training at RAAF Station Point Cook . 
 Eaton was commissioned as a pilot officer upon graduation from flying school in January 1937 , and posted to No. 1 Squadron . Within six months he was promoted to flying officer and joined No. 21 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton . In 1938 , he became an instructor at Point Cook 's No. 1 Flying Training School , where he also took part in the RAAF 's early long navigation exercises . He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 September 1939 .

 = = = Early war service = = = 
 In April 1940 , Eaton was assigned to the newly re @-@ formed Central Flying School at Camden , New South Wales , as an instructor . Promoted to temporary squadron leader in September 1940 , he was transferred to the Directorate of Training in June 1941 . He became a fighter controller at No. 5 Fighter Sector Headquarters , Darwin , Northern Territory , in March 1942 . In October that year , he departed Australia for North Africa via India and the United Kingdom , fearful that the fighting would be over before he arrived . He posted in to No. 1 Middle East Training School in January 1943 prior to taking up duties with No. 3 Squadron RAAF , which was then engaged in the Battle of Tunisia . 
 Eaton 's combat career began inauspiciously , when he was shot down three times in the space of ten days . On the first occasion , his P @-@ 40 Kittyhawk was hit by 20 mm cannon shells from an enemy fighter that he never saw . He later recalled , " I was too busy getting the kite down to be frightened . But my God was I surprised . " Eaton brought his crippled aircraft in for a forced landing at El Hamma — in the midst of a tank battle between German and New Zealand forces . After the fighting had died down he made his way over to the New Zealanders , who gave him a lift back to his air base . The second time he was shot down , his plane was struck by 88 mm anti @-@ aircraft fire , necessitating another crash landing , this time behind enemy lines . Sympathetic Arab tribesmen smuggled him past the Germans and back to his airfield . Two days later , his P @-@ 40 was hit by fire from an Me 109 that dived at him from out of the sun . He was able to glide back to base , 80 miles ( 130 km ) away , but on arriving found that it was under attack by German bombers . He decided he had no other option than to land the damaged plane among the exploding bombs , and managed to do so without mishap . His series of narrow escapes engendered a spirit of fatalism , and a habit of keeping his emotions severely in check while on duty : " I just couldn 't see myself living when so many were dying . It was something which , at the time , didn 't bear much dwelling on . " 
 = = = Squadron and wing command = = = 
 Despite his early setbacks in combat , Eaton soon rose to command No. 3 Squadron , taking over from Squadron Leader Bobby Gibbes on 21 April 1943 . He led the unit as it relocated to Malta the following month , in preparation for the Allied invasion of Sicily . Illness forced him to hand over command in June – July , but he returned to take charge of the squadron in August as it continued to fly escort and interdiction missions in Sicily with other units of No. 239 Wing RAF . His brother Roger , a flight sergeant serving with the RAF , was killed in a Wellington bomber raid during the campaign . On 3 September , No. 3 Squadron took part in the opening day of the Allied invasion of Italy , supporting the British XIII Corps as it moved inland after landing at Calabria . Enemy air resistance remained light and worthwhile ground targets few as the campaign progressed but , on 24 October , Eaton led an attack against German shipping off the Yugoslav coast that left a merchant ship and two barges on fire . He repeated the exercise on 7 November , when the squadron scored hits on vessels in two separate raids in the harbour at Split . On 19 November , when the rest of No. 239 Wing was unable to complete any missions due to adverse weather , Eaton found a hole in the clouds and led eight Kittyhawks in a successful attack on <unk> in central Italy . He was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1 December . On 14 December , he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for pressing home a night attack on Axis armour at Termoli . The citation was promulgated in the London Gazette : 
 One evening in October , 1943 , this officer led his squadron in an attack on a strong enemy force , equipped with tanks , which were attacking our troops near Termoli . In spite of intense antiaircraft fire , Squadron Leader Eaton led his formation in at a low level and pressed home an attack which completely disrupted the enemy 's forces . In this spirited action , Squadron Leader Eaton displayed inspiring leadership , great courage and tenacity . 
 On 16 February 1944 , the day after the contentious destruction of Monte Cassino , Eaton took No. 3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery , the only one of No. 239 Wing 's units to successfully bomb its target that day . He handed over command of No. 3 Squadron later that month , and was transferred to No. 1 Mobile Operations Room Unit as forward air controller for the final assault on Monte Cassino . The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy . He survived three months of constant artillery fire , including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post , striking down a British officer standing next to him . He also came under machine @-@ gun fire when he took a wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines , but again escaped unhurt . He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 7 April , in recognition of his leadership of No. 3 Squadron in North Africa , Malta , Sicily and Italy . 
 Raised to acting group captain , Eaton was given command of No. 239 Wing on 3 August 1944 , taking responsibility for No. 3 Squadron and No. 450 Squadron RAAF , No. 112 Squadron and No. 260 Squadron RAF , No. 5 Squadron of the South African Air Force , and No. 250 Squadron of the Royal Rhodesian Air Force . Credited with leading " many outstanding raids " , he was known to his staff as " The Boss " , and often flew twice a day with a different squadron on each mission ; when his superiors found out how many sorties he was personally undertaking and ordered him to cut back , he simply ceased recording his flying hours . The wing 's two RAF squadrons had already re @-@ equipped with P @-@ 51 Mustangs when Eaton took over ; No. 5 converted in September and No. 3 in November . As well as supporting the Eighth Army in Italy , the Mustang units carried out missions in Yugoslavia in concert with the Balkan Air Force , prior to Axis forces surrendering on 2 May . 
 Eaton was unofficially credited with shooting down as many as seven enemy aircraft during the Mediterranean campaigns , but was never listed among Australian flying aces . Many of the missions that he undertook with No. 3 Squadron and in command of No. 239 Wing were ground attack or anti @-@ shipping sorties , rather than air @-@ to @-@ air combat . He was also known as a leader who , when opportunities did arise to engage other aircraft , would attempt to manoeuvre his rookie pilots into position to make a " kill " , rather than take the shot himself . On 12 June , he was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order for " Outstanding skill and leadership against heavy odds " . His war service also earned him the US Silver Star , permission to wear it being gazetted on 14 June 1946 .

 Eaton was posted to Britain following the end of World War II , and attended RAF Staff College the next year . In September 1947 , he was appointed Officer Commanding No. 81 ( Fighter ) Wing in Japan , as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) . The Australian contingent initially comprised three combat units , Nos. 76 , 77 and 82 Squadrons , as well as No. 381 ( Base ) Squadron , No. 481 ( Maintenance ) Squadron , No. 111 Mobile Fighter Control Unit , and No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron . By mid @-@ 1949 , it had been reduced to No. 77 Squadron alone , and Headquarters BCOF had been disbanded ; Eaton served as " RAAF Component " commander for the remainder of his tenure in Japan . As well as surveillance patrols , training and inter @-@ service exercises , the Australian airmen took part in ceremonial flypasts . On one such occasion , over Tokyo , Eaton led his formation of thirty Mustangs into cloud with a faulty artificial horizon in his plane , with the result that he and his comrades , who were following his lead , became badly disorientated and were fortunate to avoid collision ; RAAF historian Alan Stephens considered this a not @-@ atypical example of the casual attitude to flying safety exhibited at the time by the veteran pilots of World War II . 
 Returning to Australia in November 1949 , Eaton became Deputy Director of Training at the Department of Air , Canberra , where he remained until 1951 . Later that year , he was appointed Officer Commanding No. 78 ( Fighter ) Wing at RAAF Base Williamtown , New South Wales . He had reverted to a substantive rank of wing commander since leaving Japan , as the RAAF shrank dramatically with demobilisation and many senior officers lost the temporary or acting ranks they had gained in wartime . On 15 September , he landed a Vampire jet fighter at Point Cook with one flat tyre and one wheel retracted , after its undercarriage had become jammed . The plane skidded off the runway but Eaton was able to walk away , reportedly remarking " Well , I didn 't wreck it " . He married Josephine Rumbles at Toorak Presbyterian Church in Melbourne on 10 May 1952 ; the couple later had a son and two daughters . Following Britain 's request to the Australian government for a Commonwealth garrison in the Mediterranean , in July 1952 Eaton led No. 78 Wing on deployment to RAF Hal Far near Valletta , Malta , where its combat squadrons , Nos. 75 and 76 , were equipped with leased Vampire <unk> . As the overseas posting was for a minimum of two years , his new bride and the families of other staff were permitted to make the journey as well . The Australian airmen participated in many NATO exercises while stationed at Malta , and one year took first and second place in the Middle Eastern Gunnery Contest for the " <unk> " Mason Cup . Promoted to the substantive rank of group captain on 1 January 1953 , Eaton was granted command of RAF Ta <unk> when the wing transferred there from Hal Far in June . 
 Completing his tour with No. 78 Wing in mid @-@ 1954 , Eaton joined Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch on an international mission to examine potential new fighter , bomber , transport and training aircraft for the RAAF . The team 's report advocated the F @-@ 104 Starfighter as a replacement for the CAC Sabre , as well as nuclear @-@ capable British V @-@ bomber strike aircraft to augment Australia 's Canberra bombers , and C @-@ 130 Hercules transports to replace the C @-@ 47 Dakota . While the proposals for V @-@ bombers and the F @-@ 104 were not taken up , the Australian Government acquired the C @-@ 130 in 1958 . Described as second only to the General Dynamics F @-@ 111C as the " most significant " purchase by the RAAF , the Hercules gave the Air Force its first strategic airlift capability , which in years to come would provide a " lifeline " to Australian forces deployed to Malaya , Vietnam , and other parts of the South @-@ West Pacific . The mission also recommended the locally built Vampire T35 as a jet trainer for No. 1 Applied Flying Training School ; sixty @-@ nine were later delivered by the de Havilland factory in Bankstown , New South Wales . Eaton served as RAAF Director of Operations during 1955 – 56 , and as Officer Commanding RAAF Base Williamtown and Commandant of the co @-@ located School of Land @-@ Air Warfare from March 1957 until February 1959 . He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the 1959 Queen 's Birthday Honours . 
 Following his tour at Williamtown , Eaton spent two years as Director of Joint Services Plans before attending the Imperial Defence College , London in 1961 . Raised to air commodore , he was appointed Director @-@ General Operational Requirements in 1962 . Concurrently he became an Honorary Aide @-@ de @-@ Camp to Queen Elizabeth II , in which capacity he served until 1965 . As the Army reorganised to deal with Australia 's increasing commitments to the Vietnam War in the mid @-@ 1960s , it sought to procure a dozen twin @-@ engined aircraft of a size hitherto only operated by the RAAF , and also proposed a joint review of close air support . RAAF senior command chose to deal with the Army 's proposals by ignoring them . As Director @-@ General of Operational Requirements , Eaton argued that if the RAAF did not more fully satisfy the ground support requirements of the Army , then the Army itself would seek to take control of this sphere of operations , undermining the RAAF 's position as the main provider of Australia 's air power . Pointing out to the Chief of the Air Staff , Air Marshal Murdoch , that it was " clearly the Army 's intention to have complete command and control " of air @-@ to @-@ ground assets , he warned of a parallel situation in America , where the US Army was looking to take over all battlefield air support in response to the USAF failing to keep up to date in the provision of basic attack aircraft . The RAAF 's refusal to adequately deal with its ground support responsibilities led to long @-@ running inter @-@ service enmity , and contributed to the Australian government 's decision twenty years later to transfer control of battlefield helicopters to the Army . At this time , Eaton also led the acquisition team that selected the Macchi MB @-@ 326 as the RAAF 's new jet trainer , as it met all requirements , could be licence @-@ built in Australia , and was relatively inexpensive . The first of ninety @-@ seven was delivered by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in 1967 .

 Promoted to air vice marshal , Eaton became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1966 . In December that year , with Australian Caribou transports and Iroquois helicopters already serving in Vietnam , Eaton advocated building up the RAAF 's " sharp end " there , increasing air support for ground troops . He preferred deploying Sabre or Mirage fighters rather than the mooted Canberra bombers , which he saw as more suitable for a strategic role . Above all , he accepted the " domino theory " and believed that if Australia did not aid South Vietnam , " we 'd lose the lot " . In the event , Canberras were despatched rather than fighters . In 1967 , Eaton became the last AOC of No. 224 Group RAF under the British Far East Air Force ( FEAF ) in Singapore , as permanent squadrons were dropped from its strength . This reorganisation led to him taking over as chief of staff at Headquarters FEAF the following year . In this capacity , he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath ( CB ) in the 1969 Queen 's Birthday Honours . 
 Returning to Australia , Eaton became Air Member for Personnel ( AMP ) in October 1969 . As AMP , he sat on the Air Board , the RAAF 's controlling body , which consisted of its most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff . In January 1973 , he succeeded to the post of AOC Operational Command ( now Air Command ) . He served in this position until retirement , his tenure witnessing the introduction of the F @-@ 111C swing @-@ wing bomber to service in Australia , when the first machines touched down at RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , in July . Leaving the military on 15 December 1973 , Eaton became Regional Executive for Rolls Royce Australia in Canberra . He remained with the company for the next decade , continuing to live in Canberra until his death on 17 October 1992 , at the age of 75 . In 1996 , his widow Josephine donated funding for the Air Vice @-@ Marshal B.A. Eaton ' Airman of the Year ' Award to the RAAF , to annually recognise " significant contribution to both the Service and the community " by airmen and <unk> ranked corporal or below .

Olga ’ s winds peaked at 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) before the storm turned southwestward and weakening back into a tropical storm . On November 30 it deteriorated further to a tropical depression , although it re @-@ intensified two days later to tropical storm intensity . Olga then dissipated as a tropical cyclone on December 4 east of the Bahamas . Its damaging effects were limited to ships at sea .

 The origins of Hurricane Olga were from the interaction of a cold front and a small weather disturbance in the north Atlantic Ocean , producing an extratropical low east of Bermuda on November 22 ; five other tropical cyclones and gales formed earlier in the season in the same manner . The low gradually intensified , developing an area of convection east of the center and producing a large area of gale force winds . By 0000 UTC on November 24 , the system organized enough to be classified as Subtropical Storm Two , while located about 900 mi ( 1450 km ) east @-@ southeast of Bermuda . Subsequently , the convection markedly increased and became more concentrated , with hints of an eye feature . Within 12 hours of becoming a subtropical , it is estimated the cyclone transitioned into Tropical Storm Olga ; however , it was not purely tropical , due to being positioned beneath an upper @-@ level low . Operationally , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) did not initiate advisories until nine hours later , referring it as Subtropical Storm Two for two more days . 
 When advisories first began on Olga , forecasters were uncertain how long the storm would persist , due to the storm 's presence within a much larger storm ; one hurricane model anticipated an increase in wind shear within 24 hours , which would likely cause quick dissipation . However , the NHC accurately forecast the storm to remain a cyclone for several days . Olga initially tracked northeastward , followed by a turn to the west due to a building ridge to its north . On November 25 , the storm began acquiring more characteristics of a tropical storm , such as detaching from the larger storm and developing more distinct convective rainbands . This was due to decreasing wind shear and continued atmospheric instability , although only marginally warm sea surface temperatures . After turning to the southwest , Olga resumed a northwest motion , and at 1200 UTC on November 26 intensified into a hurricane . By that time , an eye had developed in the center , and the previously large wind field had contracted . Upon attaining hurricane status , Olga was tracking northwestward due to an approaching trough . The eye steadily became better defined as outflow increased , and on November 27 Olga attained peak winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) , along with a minimum pressure of 973 mbar ( 28 @.@ 73 inHg ) . While at peak intensity , the hurricane executed a double loop about 455 mi ( 730 km ) east of Bermuda , due to interaction with a larger cyclonic circulation that was isolated from the westerlies . 
 On November 28 after finishing the second loop , Olga turned to the southwest due to a building ridge to its northwest . Around the same time , it began a steady weakening trend , due to strong wind shear displacing the convection . The eye became poorly defined as the center became exposed , and on November 29 Olga weakened to tropical storm status . With the thunderstorms rapidly diminishing , the storm weakened quickly , and Olga deteriorated further to a tropical depression on November 30 . Forecasters anticipated continued weakening until dissipation , although the cyclone was expected to move over an area of more favorable conditions , including warmer waters and lighter shear . Still existing as a tropical cyclone on December 1 , Olga extended the hurricane season beyond its typical boundaries . It continued producing a small area of deep convection , prompting one forecaster to note that " Olga is stubbornly holding on to tropical cyclone status ... for now . " After reaching a position about 240 mi ( 385 km ) northeast of the Turks and Caicos Islands , the depression turned toward the north after a trough created a weakness in the ridge . After a decrease in wind shear , deep convection redeveloped over the center , and Olga re @-@ intensified into a tropical storm on December 2 . 
 After becoming a tropical storm again , the thunderstorms organized into a rainband about 100 mi ( 160 km ) away from the center , characteristics more typical of a subtropical cyclone . By late on December 2 , the structure resembled that of a hurricane with an eye in the center , and although convection was weak , Olga was able to intensify further to winds of 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) . At the time , there was uncertainty whether the storm would strengthen further , possibly to near hurricane status , or rapidly weaken . Ultimately , an approaching trough caused weakening by increasing wind shear , while also forcing the storm eastward . On December 4 , Olga again weakened to a tropical depression as it lost most of its convection . Later that day , the circulation turned to the southeast as a ridge built to its north , and Olga degenerated into a remnant low pressure area , about 690 mi ( 1 @,@ 110 km ) east of Nassau , Bahamas . The remnant circulation turned to the south and west , completing a loop and later moving through the Bahamas before dissipating along the north coast of Cuba on December 7 .

 Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center began issuing advisories on Olga on November 24 anticipating that the storm would threaten shipping lanes in the Atlantic . Several ships and boats in the path of Olga reported seas of 12 ft ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) or higher . One boat , the Manana Tres , reported a barometric pressure of 989 millibars ( 29 @.@ 2 inHg ) and sustained structural damage . 
 In Bermuda , the Bermuda Weather Service issued gale warnings and local marine warnings for boats and other small water craft . The approach of Olga also forced cancellation of the World Yacht regatta , but there was little damage on the island . Olga brought winds of 35 – 45 mph ( 56 – 72 km / h ) and waves 15 – 22 ft ( 3 @.@ 7 – 6 @.@ 7 m ) to the island for several days , but there were no reports of any damage . The hurricane also brought rough seas to the East Coast of the United States , the Bahamas , and as far south and east as the Lesser Antilles . A buoy near Guadeloupe reported 12 ft ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) waves . High waves in Florida eroded beaches , threatening the foundations of two homes in Flagler County . The remnants of Olga later produced heavy rainfall across the Bahamas , Cuba and south Florida . 
 = Mary of Modena = 
 Mary of Modena ( Maria Beatrice Anna Margherita Isabella d 'Este ; 5 October [ O.S. 25 September ] 1658 – 7 May [ O.S. 26 April ] 1718 ) was Queen of England , Scotland and Ireland as the second wife of James II and VII ( 1633 – 1701 ) . A devout Catholic , Mary married the widowed James , who was the younger brother and heir presumptive of Charles II , ( 1630 – 1685 ) . She was uninterested in politics and devoted to James and their children , two of whom survived to adulthood : the Jacobite ( previous Roman Catholic / Stuart dynasty ) claimant to the thrones , James Francis Edward , ( who would have become James III of England , but later in life known as " The Old Pretender " ) , and Louisa Maria Teresa . 
 Born a princess of the northwestern Italian Duchy of Modena , Mary is primarily remembered for the controversial birth of James Francis Edward , her only surviving son . It was widely rumoured that he was a " changeling " , brought into the birth @-@ chamber in a warming @-@ pan , in order to perpetuate her husband 's Catholic Stuart dynasty . Although the accusation was almost certainly false , and the subsequent Privy Council investigation affirmed this , James Francis Edward 's birth was a contributing factor to the " Glorious Revolution " , the revolution which deposed James II and VII and replaced him with his Protestant eldest daughter from his first marriage to Anne Hyde , ( 1637 – 1671 ) , Lady Mary , ( later Queen Mary II ) . She and her husband , William III , Prince of Orange @-@ Nassau , would reign jointly on the English Throne as " William and Mary " . 
 Exiled to France , the " Queen over the water " — as the " Jacobites " , ( followers of James II and VII , Stuart dynasty claims , and generally Roman Catholics ) called Mary — lived with her husband and children in the Château de Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye , provided by King Louis XIV of France ( " The Sun King " ) . Mary was popular among Louis XIV 's courtiers ; however , James was considered a bore . In widowhood , Mary spent much time with the nuns at the Convent of Chaillot , where she and her daughter Louisa Maria Teresa spent their summers . In 1701 , when James II died , young James Francis Edward became king at age 13 in the eyes of the " Jacobites " , as now " King James III and VIII " . As he was too young to assume the nominal reins of government , Mary acted as his regent until he reached the age of 16 . When young James Francis Edward was asked to leave France as part of the settlement from the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 , which ended the War of the Spanish Succession ( 1701 – 1714 ) , Mary of Modena stayed , despite having no family there , her daughter Louisa Maria Teresa having unfortunately died of smallpox . Fondly remembered by her French contemporaries , Mary died of breast cancer in 1718 . 
 = = Early life ( 1658 – 1673 ) = = 
 Mary Beatrice d 'Este , the second but eldest surviving child of Alfonso IV , Duke of Modena , and his wife , Laura <unk> , was born on 5 October 1658 NS in Modena , Duchy of Modena , Italy . Her only younger brother , Francesco , succeeded their father as Duke upon his death in 1662 , the year Mary turned four . Mary and Francesco 's mother Laura was strict with them , and acted as regent of the duchy until her son came of age . Mary 's education was excellent ; she spoke French and Italian fluently , had a good knowledge of Latin and , later , mastered English . 
 Mary was described by contemporaries as " tall and admirably shaped " , and sought as a bride for James , Duke of York , by Lord Peterborough . Lord Peterborough was groom of the stole to the Duke of York . A widower , James was the younger brother and heir of Charles II of England . Duchess Laura was not initially forthcoming with a reply to Peterborough 's proposal , hoping , according to the French ambassador , for a " grander " match with the eleven @-@ year @-@ old Charles II of Spain . Whatever the reason for Laura 's initial reluctance , she finally accepted the proposal on behalf of Mary , and they were married by proxy on 30 September 1673 NS . 
 Modena was within the sphere of influence of Louis XIV of France , who endorsed Mary 's candidature and greeted Mary warmly in Paris , where she stopped en route to England , giving her a brooch worth £ 8 @,@ 000 . Her reception in England was much cooler . Parliament , which was entirely composed of Protestants , reacted poorly to the news of a Catholic marriage , fearing it was a " Papist " plot against the country . The English public , who were predominantly Protestant , branded the Duchess of York — as Mary was thereafter known as until her husband 's accession — the " Pope 's daughter " . Parliament threatened to have the marriage annulled , leading Charles to suspend parliament until 7 January 1674 OS , to ensure the marriage would be honoured and safeguarding the reputation of his House of Stuart . 
 = = Duchess of York ( 1673 – 1685 ) = = 
 = = = Household = = = 
 The Duke of York , an avowed Catholic , was twenty @-@ five years older than his bride , scarred by smallpox and afflicted with a stutter . He had secretly converted to Catholicism around 1668 . Mary first saw her husband on 23 November 1673 OS , on the day of their second marriage ceremony . James was pleased with his bride . Mary , however , at first disliked him , and burst into tears each time she saw him . Nonetheless , she soon warmed to James . From his first marriage to the commoner Anne Hyde , who had died in 1671 , James had two daughters : Lady Mary and Lady Anne . They were introduced to Mary by James with the words , " I have brought you a new play @-@ fellow " . Unlike Lady Mary , Lady Anne disliked her father 's new wife . Mary played games with Anne , to win her affection . 
 The Duchess of York annually received £ 5 @,@ 000 spending money and her own household , headed by Carey Fraser , Countess of Peterborough ; it was frequented by ladies of her husband 's selection : Frances Stewart , Duchess of Richmond — Charles II 's discarded mistress — and Anne Scott , 1st Duchess of Buccleuch . That the Duchess of York loathed gambling did not stop her ladies compelling her to do so almost every day . They believed that " if she refrained , it might be taken ill " . Consequently , Mary incurred minor gambling debts . 
 The birth of the Duchess of York 's first child , Catherine Laura , named after Queen Catherine , on 10 January 1675 OS represented the beginning of a string of children that would die in infancy . At this time she was on excellent terms with Lady Mary and she visited her in The Hague after the younger Mary had married William of Orange . She travelled incognito and took Anne with her . 
 = = = Popish plot and exile = = = 
 The Duchess of York 's Catholic secretary , Edward Colman , was , in 1678 , falsely implicated in a fictitious plot against the King by Dr. Titus Oates . The plot , known as the Popish Plot , led to the Exclusionist movement , which was headed by Anthony Ashley Cooper , 1st Earl of Shaftesbury . The <unk> sought to debar the Catholic Duke of York from the throne . Their reputation in tatters , the Yorks were begrudgingly exiled to Brussels , a domain of the King of Spain , ostensibly to visit Lady Mary — since 1677 the wife of Prince William III of Orange . Accompanied by her not yet three @-@ year @-@ old daughter Isabella and Lady Anne , the Duchess of York was saddened by James 's extra @-@ marital affair with Catherine Sedley . Mary 's spirits were briefly revived by a visit from her mother , who was living in Rome . 
 A report that King Charles was very sick sent the Yorks back to England post @-@ haste . They feared the King 's eldest illegitimate son , James Scott , 1st Duke of Monmouth , and commander of England 's armed forces , might usurp the crown if Charles died in their absence . The matter was compounded by the fact that Monmouth enjoyed the support of the <unk> , who held a majority in the House of Commons of England . Charles survived but , feeling the Yorks returned to court too soon , sent James and Mary to Edinburgh , where they stayed on @-@ and @-@ off for the next three years . Lodging in Holyrood Palace , the Yorks had to make do without Ladies Anne and Isabella , who stayed in London on Charles 's orders . The Yorks were recalled to London in February 1680 , only to return again to Edinburgh that autumn ; this time they went on a more honourable footing : James was created King 's Commissioner to Scotland . Separated from Lady Isabella once again , Mary sank into a state of sadness , exacerbated by the passing of the Exclusion bill in the Commons . Lady Isabella , thus far the only one of Mary 's children to survive infancy , died in February 1681 . Isabella 's death plunged Mary into a religious mania , worrying her physician . At the same time as news reached Holyrood of Isabella 's death , Mary 's mother was falsely accused of offering £ 10 @,@ 000 for the murder of the King . The accuser , a pamphleteer , was executed by order of the King . 
 The Exclusionist reaction that followed the Popish plot had died down by May 1682 . Exclusionist @-@ dominated Parliament , suspended since March 1681 , never again met in the reign of Charles II . Therefore , the Duke and Duchess of York returned to England , and the Duchess gave birth to a daughter named Charlotte Mary in August 1682 ; Charlotte Mary 's death three weeks later , according to the French ambassador , robbed James of " hope that any child of his can live " — all James 's sons by Anne Hyde , his first wife , died in infancy . James 's sadness was dispelled by his revival in popularity following the discovery of a plot to kill the King and him . The objective of the plot , known as the Rye House Plot , was to have Monmouth placed on the throne as Lord Protector . The revival was so strong that , in 1684 , James was re @-@ admitted to the Privy Council , after an absence of eleven years . 
 = = Queen ( 1685 – 1689 ) = = 
 Despite all the furore over <unk> , James ascended to his brother 's thrones easily upon the latter 's death , which occurred on 6 February 1685 OS , possibly because the said alternative could provoke another civil war . Mary sincerely mourned Charles , recalling in later life , " He was always kind to me . " Mary and James 's £ 119 @,@ 000 joint coronation ceremony , occurring on 23 April OS , Saint George 's day , was meticulously planned . Precedents were sought for Mary because a full @-@ length joint coronation had not occurred since the ceremony performed for Henry VIII of England and Catherine of Aragon . 
 Queen Mary 's health had still not recovered after the death of Lady Isabella . So much so , in fact , that the Tuscan envoy reported to Florence that " general opinion turns [ for Mary 's successor ] in the direction of the Princess , Your Highness 's daughter " . France , too , was preparing for the Queen 's imminent demise , putting forward as its candidate for James 's new wife the Duke of Enghien 's daughter . The Queen was then trying to make her brother , the Duke of Modena , marry the former , Anna Maria Luisa de ' Medici . 
 In February 1687 , the Queen , at the time irritated by the King 's affair with Catherine Sedley , Countess of Dorchester , moved into new apartments in Whitehall ; Whitehall had been home to a Catholic chapel since December 1686 . Her apartments were designed by Christopher Wren at the cost of £ 13 @,@ 000 . Because the palace 's renovation was thus far unfinished , the King received ambassadors in her rooms , much to the Queen 's chagrin . Five months later , shortly after the marriage talks with Tuscany collapsed , the Queen 's mother , Duchess Laura , died . Therefore , the whole English court went into mourning . Duchess Laura left Mary " a considerable sum of cash " and some jewellery . William III of Orange , James 's son @-@ in @-@ law , sensed popular discontent with James 's government ; he used the death of Mary 's mother as a guise to send his half @-@ uncle , Count <unk> , to England , ostensibly to <unk> Queen Mary , but in reality as a spy . 
 Having visited Bath , in the hope its waters would aid conception , Queen Mary became pregnant in late 1687 . When the pregnancy became public knowledge shortly before Christmas , Catholics rejoiced . Protestants , who had tolerated James 's Catholic government because he had no Catholic heir , were concerned . The Protestant disillusion came to a head after the child was known to be male , and many Protestants believed the child was spurious ; if not , James II 's Catholic dynasty would have been perpetuated . Popular opinion alleged that the child , named James Francis Edward , was smuggled into the birth chamber as a substitute to the Queen 's real but stillborn child . This rumour was widely accepted as fact by Protestants , despite the many witnesses of the birth . Mainly by mismanagement on James ' part , these rumours had some excuse as from personal prejudice he had excluded many from the ceremony whose testimony must have been counted valid ; most of the witnesses were Catholics or foreigners , and several , such as the Princess Anne of Denmark , later to be Queen Anne , and the Protestant prelates , or the family of the Princesses whom the new birth would remove from the direct succession , were not allowed to be present . Anne later answered a memorandum of 18 questions regarding James Francis Edward 's birth for her sister , the Princess of Orange . Anne 's answers , biased and unreliable , convinced the Princess of Orange that her father had thrust a changeling upon the nation . Count <unk> , returning to the Netherlands shortly after the birth , agreed with Anne 's findings . 
 Issued by seven leading Whig nobles , the invitation for William to invade England signalled the beginning of a revolution that culminated in James II 's deposition . The invitation assured William that " nineteen parts of twenty of the people throughout the kingdom " wished for an intervention . The revolution , known as the Glorious Revolution , deprived James Francis Edward of his right to the English throne , on the grounds he was not the King 's real son and , later , because he was a Catholic . England in the hands of William of Orange 's 15 @,@ 000 @-@ strong army , James and Mary went into exile in France . There , they stayed at the expense of King Louis XIV , who supported the Jacobite cause .

 As Mary II and William III & II had ascended the English and Scottish thrones , Mary of Modena ceased to be Queen of England on 11 December 1688 OS and of Scotland on 11 May 1689 OS . This was concurrent with her husband 's formal deposition . James II , however , backed by Louis XIV of France , still considered himself king by divine right and maintained it was not within parliament 's prerogative to depose a monarch . 
 Louis XIV gave the exiled King and Queen the use of Château de Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye , where they set up court @-@ in @-@ exile . Mary soon became a popular fixture at Louis XIV 's court at Versailles , where diarist Madame de Sévigné acclaimed Mary for her " distinguished bearing and her quick wit " . Questions of precedence , however , marred Mary 's relations with the Dauphine of France , Maria Anna of Bavaria . Because Mary was accorded the privileges and rank of a queen , Maria Anna was outranked by her . Therefore , Maria Anna refused to see Mary , etiquette being a sensitive issue at Versailles . In spite of this , Louis XIV and his secret wife , Madame de <unk> , became close friends with Mary . As there was no queen at the French court , nor a dauphine after 1690 , Mary took precedence over all the female members of the French court and French royal house , as did her daughter in her capacity of a royal princess until the next French dauphine appeared in 1711 . James was largely excluded from French court life . His contemporaries found him boring , and French courtiers frequently joked that " when one talks to him , one understands why he is here . " Mary gave birth to Princess Louise Mary in 1692 . She was to be James and Mary 's last child . 
 Initially supported by Irish Catholics in his effort to regain the thrones , James launched an expedition to Ireland in March 1689 . He abandoned it upon his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 . During James 's campaign , Mary supported his cause throughout the British Isles : she sent three French supply ships to Bantry Bay and £ 2 @,@ 000 to Jacobite rebels in Dundee . She financed those measures by selling her jewellery . Money problems plagued the Stuart court @-@ in @-@ exile , despite a substantial pension from Louis XIV of 50 @,@ 000 livres . Mary tried her best to assist those of her husband 's followers living in poverty , and encouraged her children to give part of their pocket money to Jacobite refugees .

 The collapse of James 's invasion of Ireland in 1691 upset Mary . Her spirits were lifted by news of the marriage of her brother , the Duke of Modena . He married Margherita Maria Farnese of Parma . When , in 1695 , Mary 's brother died , the House of Este was left with one progenitor , Cardinal @-@ Duke Rinaldo . Queen Mary , concerned for the dynasty 's future , urged the Cardinal @-@ Duke to resign his cardinalate , " for the good of the people and for the perpetuation of the sovereign house of Este " . Duke Rinaldo 's bride , Princess Charlotte Felicitas of Brunswick @-@ Lüneburg , was , according to Mary , " of an easy disposition best suited to [ the Duke ] " . 
 A bone of contention , however , arose over the Queen 's inheritance and dowry . Duke Rinaldo refused to release the former , and left the latter £ 15 @,@ 000 in arrears . In 1700 , five years later , the Duke finally paid the Queen her dowry ; her inheritance , however , remained sequestered , and relations with Modena worsened again when Rinaldo allied himself with Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I. Leopold was an enemy of Louis XIV , James and Mary 's patron .

 In March 1701 , James II suffered a stroke while hearing mass at the Château de Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye , leaving him partially paralysed . Fagon , Louis XIV 's personal physician , recommend the waters of Bourbon @-@ l <unk> , to cure the King 's paralysis . The waters , however , had little effect , and James II died of a seizure on 16 September 1701 . Louis XIV , in contravention of the Peace of Ryswick , declared James Francis Edward King of England , Ireland and Scotland as James III and VIII . This act irritated King William III and II , who had ruled alone since the death of his wife , Mary II . Because James Francis Edward was a minor , Queen Mary acted as nominal regent for her son . Mary presided over his regency council , too , although she was uninterested in politics . Before his death , James II expressed his wish that Mary 's regency would last no longer than their son 's 18th birthday . 
 Dressed in mourning for the remainder of her life , Queen Mary 's first act as regent was to disseminate a manifesto , outlining James Francis Edward 's claims . It was largely ignored in England . In Scotland , however , the confederate Lords sent Lord Belhaven to Saint @-@ Germain , to convince the Queen to surrender to them custody of James Francis Edward and accede to his conversion to Protestantism . 
 The conversion , said Belhaven , would enable James Francis Edward 's accession to the English throne upon William III 's death . The Queen @-@ Regent was not swayed by Belhaven 's argument , so a compromise was reached : James Francis Edward , if he became King , would limit the number of Roman Catholic priests in England and promise not to tamper with the established Church of England . In exchange , the confederate Lords would do all in their power to block the passing of the Hanoverian succession in Scottish parliament . When , in March 1702 , William III died , Simon Fraser , 11th Lord Lovat , declared for James Francis Edward at Inverness . Soon after , Lovat travelled to the court @-@ in @-@ exile at Saint @-@ Germain , and begged the Queen @-@ Regent to allow her son to come to Scotland . Lovat intended to raise an army of 15 @,@ 000 soldiers in Scotland , to seize the throne for James Francis Edward . Mary refused to part with James Francis Edward , and the rising failed . Mary 's regency ceased with her son 's reaching of the age of 16 . 
 Having wished to become a nun in her youth , Queen Mary sought refuge from the stresses of exile at the Convent of the Visitations , Chaillot , near Paris , where she befriended Louis XIV 's penitent mistress , Louise de La Vallière . There , Mary stayed with her daughter for long periods almost every summer . It was here , too , in 1711 , that Queen Mary found out that , as part of the embryonic Treaty of Utrecht , James Francis Edward was to lose Louis XIV 's explicit recognition and be forced to leave France . The next year , when James Francis Edward was expelled and Louise Mary died of smallpox , Mary was very upset ; according to Mary 's close friend Madame de <unk> , Mary was " a model of desolation " . Deprived of the company of her family , Queen Mary lived out the rest of her days at Chaillot and Saint @-@ Germain in virtual poverty , unable to travel by her own means because all her horses had died and she could not afford to replace them . 
 Following her death from cancer on 7 May 1718 , Mary was remembered fondly by her French contemporaries , three of whom , Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate , the Duke of Saint @-@ Simon and the Marquis of <unk> , deemed her a " saint " . Mary 's remains were interred in Chaillot among the nuns she had befriended .

 Fight Like Apes formed late 2006 following the breakup of the band Soft Cuddly Toys by Mary @-@ Kate Geraghty ( known as " MayKay " ) , Jamie Fox ( known as " Pockets " ) , Adrian Mullan and Tom Ryan . MayKay and Pockets first met as teenagers on holiday in Spain where they realised they both went to nearby schools and shared the same " extremely optimistically cynical outlook on life " . When MayKay told Pockets she loved singing he had her sign a contract on a piece of tissue in a bar . Pockets 's parents were unhappy with their son 's " disgusting " taste in music . He dropped out of his final year of study at Dublin City University and a potential career in journalism to pursue his musical career . MayKay had been studying medicinal chemistry , and later a philosophy course at Trinity College Dublin . They habitually met from early morning and spent their days eating together before deciding to form a band . Their chosen name was inspired by Caesar 's battle cry of “ Now fight like apes ” in the what they describe as the " notoriously bad " Battle for the Planet of the Apes .

 Their debut EP , How Am I Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns ? , Recorded by Lee Boylan and released by Irish indie label FIFA Records in early 2007 , sold out and generated a significant amount of interest in the media and in the Irish blogging community in the process . In May 2007 , Fight Like Apes won Phantom FM 's Topman Unsigned Band Search ; their prize was to be a support act of The <unk> at show in Dublin . Fight Like Apes played both Electric Picnic ( their first major Irish festival ) and Hard Working Class Heroes in 2007 and also performed at the CMJ Music Marathon in New York . They were also chosen to play the <unk> stage at EXIT in Serbia after sending a demo of their songs to the organisers . On 13 October 2007 , Fight Like Apes performed " Jake Summers " on television chat show , Tubridy Tonight . 
 The title of their second EP , David Carradine is a Bounty Hunter Whos Robotic Arm Hates Your Crotch , released on 2 November 2007 ( produced by Lee Boylan ) , was inspired by the film Future Force starring David Carradine , which the band found on the internet . The EP 's lead track , " Do You Karate ? " , was a minor hit on the Irish independent music scene . The band set off on their first UK tour after the EP 's release and their " Jake Summers " single was released there through the label , Cool For Cats ( sister of Fierce Panda ) . In February 2008 , the band toured Ireland and the UK as a support act of The Von Bondies . Von Bondies member Jason <unk> has described Fight Like Apes as “ candy wrapped in barbed wire ” . Fight Like Apes were invited to participate in the sixth series of RTÉ 's annual Other Voices music show , performing on 19 March 2008 . They also appeared on RTÉ Two 's <unk> television show . Fight Like Apes performed at the South by Southwest festival in Austin , Texas in 2008 . Upon their return from South by Southwest in March / April 2008 , they went on a national tour of Ireland . Later that year , Fight Like Apes appeared at several music festivals in Ireland and the UK , including an appearance on the Futures Stage at T in the Park , and two appearances at the 2008 Glastonbury Festival , as well as Oxegen 2008 and Indie @-@ pendence in Ireland .

 BBC Radio 1 's Steve Lamacq has described Fight Like Apes as a " great Misfit band " inhabiting " a lonely place out on the periphery of the indie rock world " . At one show in June 2008 , he witnessed them " thrash about on their guitars and keyboards and <unk> [ sic ] like it 's some kind of pop exorcism " and saw them " rolling around the empty dancefloor <unk> [ sic ] " . Today FM presenter Alison Curtis has described them as " really talented ... kind of rocky and metallic and their front girl is extremely watchable , almost going into Debbie Harry territory " . 
 The band 's influences include B movies , computer games , kung @-@ fu and wrestling . " Do You Karate ? " , " a thumping bass driven flourish of a song " , displays the band 's " trademark twin @-@ synth attack " and the Pixies @-@ style " <unk> " has been described as " a concise ode to fish and chips " . Musically they are fond of My Bloody Valentine , <unk> and Tom Waits , Grand Pocket Orchestra , <unk> Shank , Jape and Giveamanakick . They dislike guitars and have been known to perform with kitchen implements such as pots and pans when on stage ; MayKay and Pockets even play keyboards with their heads . They purposefully construct lengthy record titles to " piss off " journalists and radio presenters and their self @-@ defined " karate rock " genre was directed at the NME after the British magazine tried to place them in the same category as two other female @-@ fronted bands . 
 Vocalist MayKay has been described as one of Ireland 's " most mesmerising front women " in recent history , with her long black hair and banshee wail provoking male fans to confess simultaneous feelings of terror and attraction online . She is known to <unk> lyrics such as " you 're like Kentucky Fried Chicken but without the taste " and " you 're a fucking disappointment to the human race " , taken from the song " Jake Summers " , a song inspired by former teen idol of California Dreams fame . Pockets writes most of the band 's songs , plays the keyboard and provides vocals for some of the band 's songs . Adrian and Tom tend to remain in the background , choosing not to be photographed . The band have never written anything fictional and their lyrics have been described by Nadine O 'Regan in The Sunday Business Post as " occasionally literally gynaecological in their detail and regularly relatively shocking in their honesty " . MayKay and Pockets claim that most of their lyrics are shaped by one person who has broken each of their hearts .

 = 80th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division ( United Kingdom ) = 
 The 80th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division was an infantry division of the British Army formed at the beginning of 1943 , during the Second World War . For the twenty months that the division existed , it was a training formation . Army recruits that had been assigned to the division and fully trained were allocated to formations fighting overseas . Notably , the division was used as a source of reinforcements for the 21st Army Group , which was fighting in Normandy . After all available troops left the United Kingdom for France , the division was disbanded . 
 A phantom 80th Infantry Division was formed in the division 's place to aid the Operation Fortitude deception effort that supported the invasion of France . This division was part of the notional British Fourth Army , which was portrayed as part of the threatened Allied landing at the Pas de Calais . The overall deception plan was successful , and affected the German response to the Allied invasion . The phantom division was " disbanded " towards the end of the war . 
 = = Divisional history = = 
 = = = Training formation = = = 
 During the Second World War , the divisions of the British Army were divided between " Higher Establishment " and " Lower Establishment " formations . The former were intended for deployment overseas and combat , whereas the latter were strictly for home defence in a static role . During the winter of 1942 – 43 , three " Lower Establishment " divisions were renamed " Reserve Divisions " . On 1 January 1943 , these three were supplemented by the raising of a new reserve division , the 80th Infantry , placed under the command of Major @-@ General Lionel Howard Cox . The four reserve divisions were used as training units . Soldiers who had completed their corps training were assigned to these divisions . The soldiers were given five weeks of additional training at the section , platoon and company level , before undertaking a final three @-@ day exercise . Troops would then be ready to be sent overseas to join other formations . Training was handled in this manner to relieve the " Higher Establishment " divisions from being milked for replacements for other units and to allow them to intensively train without the interruption of having to handle new recruits . 
 During its existence , the 80th Division was assigned to Western Command . The division was spread out across Western Command 's area of responsibility with at least one battalion based in <unk> Barracks , Lancaster , Lancashire and another based around Shropshire . The Imperial War Museum comments that the division insignia of a troopship was derived from " one of the prime functions of the Division [ that being ] to find drafts for overseas postings " . The design included " two long and prominent bow waves from the ship " , which resulted in the troops giving it the nickname the " torpedoed troopship " . The insignia was only worn by the permanent members of the division . 
 On 30 June 1944 , the four training divisions had a combined total of 22 @,@ 355 men . Of this number , only 1 @,@ 100 were immediately available as replacements for the 21st Army Group . The remaining 21 @,@ 255 men were considered ineligible at that time for service abroad , for medical reasons , or for not being fully fit or fully trained , or for other reasons . Over the following six months , up to 75 per cent of these men would be deployed to reinforce 21st Army Group following the completion of their training and certification of fitness . Stephen Hart comments that , by September , the 21st Army Group " had bled Home Forces dry of draftable riflemen " after the losses suffered during the Normandy Campaign , leaving the army in Britain , with the exception of the 52nd ( Lowland ) Infantry Division , with just " young lads , old men , and the unfit " . On 1 September 1944 , the division was disbanded . Cox took command of the 38th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division , which took over the role of the 80th Division . 
 = = = Deception formation = = = 
 The creation of the fictitious division arose from an actual reorganization of British forces . During 1944 , the British Army was facing a manpower crisis as it did not have enough men to replace the losses to front line infantry . While efforts were made to address this ( such as transferring men from the Royal Artillery and Royal Air Force to be retrained as infantry ) , the War Office began disbanding divisions to downsize the army so as to transfer men to other units to help keep those as close to full strength as possible . The War Office decided to disband several " Lower Establishment " divisions , which included the 80th Infantry ( Reserve ) Division . 
 The Fortitude deception staff seized upon this opportunity to retain the division as a phantom unit . A cover story was established to explain the change in the division 's status . It was claimed that with the war nearing an end , several Territorial Army divisions would revert to their peacetime recruiting role and release their equipment and resources to other units . For the 80th , this was the 38th Division . With the transfer of equipment , the 80th was notionally raised to the " Higher Establishment " , readied for war , and joined the phantom VII Corps that was part of the notional British Fourth Army . The phantom 80th , retaining the insignia of the real division , was supposedly based in Canterbury and composed of the 50th , 208th and 211th brigades . 
 The notional Fourth Army was part of Operation Bodyguard , the codename for the deception plan designed to protect Operation Overlord . Initially , the Fourth Army was part of Fortitude North . This plan aimed to make the Germans believe that the notional 250 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Fourth Army , based in Scotland , would assault Norway . The deception plan aimed to keep the German garrison of nearly half a million men stationed in Norway to resist such an attack . Following the invasion of Normandy , the Fourth Army was " transferred " south to reinforce the First United States Army Group ( FUSAG ) , another fictitious formation . Fortitude South aimed to convince the Germans that FUSAG had 500 @,@ 000 men in more than fifty divisions and would launch the main Allied invasion in the Pas de Calais , 45 days after the Normandy landings . The goal of the operation was to persuade the Germans not to move the 18 divisions of the 15th Army to Normandy . VII Corps was notionally transferred south , as part of Fourth Army , to join FUSAG . Following this move , the newly created fictitious 80th Infantry Division was assigned to the imaginary Corps . To aid in the deception , signallers from the 61st Infantry Division maintained wireless traffic , to give the Germans the impression of an actual 80th Division . In addition , Juan Pujol García , the British double agent known as Garbo who played a vital role in Fortitude , reported to the Germans that the 80th Division was undertaking assault training . 
 Fortitude South has been credited with ensuring the German 15th Army was not deployed against the Allied invasion force too soon and ensuring the success of Operation Overlord . Gerhard Weinberg stated that the Germans " readily accepted the existence and location " of FUSAG , believed the threat to the Pas de Calais was real and " it was only at the end of July " that they realized a second assault was not coming ; " by that time , it was too late to move reinforcements " . However , Mary Barbier wrote " it is time to consider that the importance of the deception has been overrated " . She argues that 15th Army was largely immobile and not combat @-@ ready , that despite the deception numerous German divisions – including the 1st SS Panzer Division , which was held in reserve behind the 15th Army – from across Europe were transferred to Normandy to repel the invasion , and that the Germans had realized as early as May that a real threat to Normandy existed . Barbier further commented that while the Germans believed the deception due to " preconceived ideas about the importance of the Pas De Calais " , the Allied staff had overestimated the effectiveness of the deception after the 15th Army 's inaction because they held a " preconceived notion of what <unk> would accomplish " . Following the Battle of Normandy , the phantom 80th Division was " transferred " around the east coast of England , moving back and forth between VII Corps and the equally bogus II Corps . The division was eventually " disbanded " in April 1945 .

 12 oz . Mouse is an American animated television series created by Matt Maiellaro for Adult Swim . The series revolves around Mouse Fitzgerald , nicknamed " Fitz " ( voiced by Maiellaro ) , an alcoholic mouse who performs odd jobs so he can buy more beer . Together with his chinchilla companion Skillet , Fitz begins to recover suppressed memories that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished . This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world . 
 In producing the series , Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost @-@ cutting measure ; the series is animated by Radical Axis . He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot , but established a serial format after starting the second episode . He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters ; however , the series finale concluded differently from planned . Maiellaro cast people around his office for the characters , starring himself as the protagonist and Nine Pound Hammer vocalist Scott Luallen as the voice of Roostre ; the band also performs the opening theme . 
 The pilot episode for 12 oz . Mouse , " Hired " , premiered on June 19 , 2005 . The series became a regular staple of Adult Swim 's lineup on October 23 , 2005 and ended on December 17 , 2006 . Critical reception was mixed ; some praised the series ' experimental nature , while others felt confounded by it .

 The show revolves around a mouse named Mouse Fitzgerald ( voiced by Matt Maiellaro ) , nicknamed " Fitz " , who is fond of beer and caught in a world of espionage , love and the delights of odd jobs . The show employs a serial format , and its ongoing storyline developed from absurdist comedy to include mystery and thriller elements . Fitz begins to recover suppressed memories that he once had a wife and a child who have now vanished . This leads him to seek answers about his past and the shadowy forces that seem to be manipulating his world . 
 Fitz suspects there is a sinister conspiracy which appears to revolve around fields of " <unk> [ sic ] " pills beneath the city , and Shark ( Adam Reed ) , Clock , and Rectangular Businessman 's ( Kurt <unk> ) attempts to control the nature of time and reality . Fitz and Skillet receive help from Liquor ( Matt Harrigan ) , Roostre ( Scott Luallen ) , Stoned Peanut Cop ( Nick Weidenfeld ) and others as they engage in gun battles , blow things up , and try to understand cryptic hints . The show also sometimes contains surreal " subliminal " images that flash across the screen during key plot moments , including skulls , mustached snake beasts and people screaming . 
 The series concludes the revelation that Fitz has been kidnapped and placed into a simulation by the <unk> Figure . He is about to be killed by Shark and the Rectangular Businessman , in their true forms outside the simulation , when he is rescued by the true form of Peanut Cop and a nurse who works in the simulation chamber . They kill Shark and Rectangle Businessman , but it is unknown if they are truly dead because the simulation in which most of the show takes place is probably taking place in another simulation . One of the purposes of the simulation seen in most of the show was to extract information from Fitz . The conclusion to episode 20 is ambiguous as to whether or not it is actually the end of the series , as some aspects of the plot remain unresolved – Golden Joe says " I thought this was done , " to which Fitz replies , " I thought so too . I guess we 're not . "

 According to Maiellaro , the series was pitched as a table read to the network . He jokingly stated that they accepted it after claiming that production costs would total " five dollars and will take some of the paper sitting in the copier . " Maiellaro borrowed inspiration from surrealism and the films of David Lynch . He intended for the series to lack continuity starting from the pilot , but established a serial format after starting to work on the second episode . He had constructed an ending for the series as well as a detailed map of characters ; however , the series finale concluded differently from planned . 
 Radical Axis provided animation for the series using Final Cut Pro . Described as " lo @-@ fi animation " , Maiellaro crudely designed the characters as a cost @-@ cutting measure , with the exception of <unk> , a many @-@ armed monster summoned in the season two episode " <unk> Chronicles " , which was drawn and animated by Todd <unk> at the studio , and Shark , which was borrowed from the Space Ghost Coast to Coast episode " Kentucky Nightmare " . In a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes clip of the show , Maiellaro explained that to animate the series , he would first grab a nearby sheet of copy paper , draw something , and then scan it , followed by him sending the file to an animator . Rhoda , a character from the series , was drawn on the back of a script page for Perfect Hair Forever . A scan of the paper revealed the textual contents behind it , which Maiellaro decided to leave in .

 Maiellaro cast people around his office to voice the characters . He provides the voice of the protagonist , Mouse Fitzgerald . He originally only gave the scratch dialogue for the character during production of the pilot episode , but chose himself to voice Mouse regularly after hearing his lines assembled in the final cut . Kurt <unk> was chosen by Maiellaro to voice Rectangular Businessman , who " already had that sort of smooth arrogance in his voice " , making him a " perfect " fit for him . Matt Harrigan was selected to voice Liquor , who is " always looking to make light of a situation " , according to Maiellaro . 
 Nick Weidenfeld provides the voice of Peanut Cop ; Melissa <unk> portrays an annoying woman in a green sweater , who Maiellaro dubs " <unk> " . Bonnie <unk> voices Man / Woman , picked for what Maiellaro stated is a " pouty , stand @-@ <unk> quality " in her delivery . Nick <unk> voices The Eye and Adam Reed plays Shark . Vocalist of Nine Pound Hammer Scott Luallen voices Roostre ; the band also composed the opening theme song for the series . Golden Joe is voiced by Vishal Roney ; after hearing his first take on the character , Maiellaro explained that he was left unable to write any of his lines . He proceeded to only provide the basic structure of his lines in the script , instructing him to <unk> the rest . 
 = = = Title sequence and music = = = 
 Maiellaro spent three weeks working with <unk> on putting together the set for the opening title sequence . The set was filmed with a motion control camera , and was inserted with miniature explosives and smoke bombs for special effect . Nine Pound Hammer composed the opening theme song ; Maiellaro sought for a song representing the " carefree " lifestyle of Mouse who " does things like drive drunk , film porno and shoot guns . " Maiellaro , who plays the electric guitar in his free time , also composed the song " F @-@ Off " , featured in the first episode , which he wrote while working on Space Ghost Coast to Coast .

 Justin Heckert of Atlanta magazine opined that " the animation and art look like they were done by daycare students " , while Lucy Maher of Common Sense Media rated it one star , criticizing Fitz 's " anarchist " qualities and ultimately stated that " parents with teens who are interested in watching should preview an episode or two before letting them tune in on their own .

 = 24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstjäger = 
 The 24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstjäger was a German mountain infantry division of the Waffen @-@ SS , the armed wing of the German Nazi Party that served alongside but was never formally part of the Wehrmacht during World War II . Named Karstjäger , it was one of the thirty @-@ eight divisions fielded by the Waffen @-@ SS . Formed on 18 July 1944 from the SS Volunteer <unk> Battalion , its nominal strength was never more than theoretical and the division was soon reduced to the Waffen Mountain ( Karstjäger ) Brigade of the SS . Throughout its existence as a battalion , division and brigade , it was primarily involved in fighting partisans in the Karst region on the frontiers of Yugoslavia , Italy , and Austria ; the mountainous terrain required specialized mountain troops and equipment . 
 Founded in 1942 as a company , the unit consisted mainly of Yugoslav Volksdeutsche and recruits from South Tyrol . Although primarily focused on anti @-@ partisan operations , it also saw action in the wake of the Italian surrender when it moved to disarm Italian troops in Tarvisio and protect ethnic German communities in Italy . In addition , at the end of the war it successfully fought to keep passes into Austria open , allowing German units to escape the Balkans and subsequently surrender to British forces . The remnants of the unit became some of the last Germans to lay down their arms when they surrendered to the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 In mid @-@ 1942 , the Waffen @-@ SS formed a company intended for anti @-@ partisan operations in the rugged and high @-@ altitude border region between Italy , Austria and Yugoslavia known as the Karst . SS @-@ Standartenführer ( Colonel ) Hans Brandt , a geologist and <unk> , suggested the creation of the unit . The company was formed at the SS training centre at Dachau on 10 July 1942 from soldiers of the supply services training and replacement battalion of the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama ( 2nd Croatian ) . 
 It was expanded to battalion strength of around 500 troops in November 1942 , and as the SS @-@ Freiwilligen @-@ <unk> Battalion , it spent the first six months of 1943 training in Austria . The unit drew its recruits mainly from Yugoslav Volksdeutsche ( ethnic Germans ) and South <unk> , with the officer cadre being drawn from SS geological detachments . The battalion @-@ strength Waffen @-@ SS Geological Corps ( German : SS @-@ <unk> ) from which such detachments were drawn had been formed in April 1941 , and consisted mainly of engineers with a few geologists . They examined caves and natural obstacles , and determined whether off @-@ road terrain was suitable for tanks . They were also responsible for locating sources of fresh water . Following the Italian capitulation in September 1943 , the battalion was tasked with disarming Italian troops around Tarvisio on the border between the three countries . It then moved on to protective duties for nearby Volksdeutsche communities . From October 1943 until June 1944 , the battalion was based at Gradisca d <unk> in Italy , and participated in anti @-@ partisan operations in the areas of Trieste , Udine and the Istrian peninsula . On 10 October , a column of the battalion was ambushed at the <unk> Pass , suffering three killed and eight wounded . The following day the battalion burned down the village of <unk> and killed 16 local men in retaliation . Up to 19 October 1943 , the battalion suffered a total of 18 killed and 45 wounded in a series of engagements near the village of Flitsch . During the same period , the battalion captured two Italian 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) mountain guns , which significantly increased its firepower . 
 During late October and November 1943 , the battalion was engaged in anti @-@ partisan operations around Saga and <unk> , including Operation <unk> ( Eaves ) . In late November , the battalion was placed under the command of the Supreme SS and Police Leader , Italy , SS @-@ Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen @-@ SS ( Lieutenant General ) Karl Wolff for an operation . In February 1944 , the battalion conducted Operation Ratte ( Rat ) , during which it burned down the villages of Komen and <unk> , and interned the population of both villages in labour camps . Early in 1944 , Brand suggested that Slovene nationalists be recruited into the battalion , but the idea was rejected by SS headquarters , who feared that such a policy would allow the infiltration of the unit by Yugoslav Partisans . At this stage , it was estimated that there were about 20 @,@ 000 communist partisans operating in the Gorizia region . During March 1944 , the battalion was involved in a rapid series of named operations , including <unk> ( Cypress ) , <unk> ( Violet ) , <unk> ( Mole ) and <unk> ( Light Blue ) , resulting in significant guerilla casualties , as well as executions of captured partisans . In March and April , Operation <unk> ( Daffodil ) was conducted over 12 days , followed by Operation Liane in late May , and the long @-@ running Operation Annemarie which covered the period 7 May to 16 July 1944 . In June 1944 , a patrol from the battalion failed to return from a task in the vicinity of Cividale del Friuli . Two days later , they were located with their torsos stripped naked and their severed heads impaled on bayonets . The unit became known for shooting suspected partisans . While engaged in anti @-@ partisan work , the battalion grew to a strength of around 1 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 On 18 July 1944 , Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler ordered that the battalion be expanded to divisional size , although the authorised strength was only 6 @,@ 600 troops . The 24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstjäger was to be established by the Higher SS and Police Leader ( German : Höhere SS @-@ und Polizeiführer ) for the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral , SS @-@ Gruppenführer ( Major General ) Odilo Globocnik . The name Karstjäger was derived from a combination of Karst , denoting the region of operations , and Jäger , the German military term for light infantry . The division was to consist of two Gebirgsjäger ( mountain infantry ) regiments , with an artillery regiment , reconnaissance , Panzerjäger ( anti @-@ tank ) and pioneer battalions , as well as replacement and supply troops . The division was supplied with 14 captured Italian Carro Armato P 40 tanks , but these proved unreliable , with only half being serviceable at any one time . In August 1944 , the under @-@ strength division participated in Operation <unk> under the command of the 188th Mountain Division . Between August and November 1944 , the division continued performing anti @-@ partisan duties in the same region , but its strength had only reached 3 @,@ 000 , less than half of its authorised establishment . It proved impossible to recruit sufficient troops for the division , and in December 1944 the division was downgraded to a brigade . 
 During late 1944 and early 1945 , the Waffen Mountain ( Karstjäger ) Brigade of the SS fought first against British @-@ supported partisans in the Julian Alps , and was then deployed to the coastal area around Trieste and the <unk> @-@ Grado Lagoon . In danger of being cut off by Allied forces , the brigade soon returned to the Julian Alps , having to fight its way through the Tagliamento river valley between <unk> and Gemona . Toward the end of April 1945 , the brigade fought British and New Zealand forces on the southern fringe of the Julian Alps . The brigade replacement company , which had been sent to Cividale from its training centre at <unk> , Austria , managed to destroy a number of British tanks with <unk> and the assistance of a tank company . In the final weeks of the war the brigade was part of a Kampfgruppe ( battlegroup ) commanded by SS @-@ Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen @-@ SS ( Brigadier ) Heinz Harmel , which was ordered to keep the <unk> passes open between Yugoslavia and Austria . This task was critical in allowing German forces to withdraw from Yugoslavia in order to surrender to British rather than Yugoslav forces . The Kampfgruppe succeeded in its final task , and was one of the last German units to surrender , when it encountered the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945 . 
 = = Order of battle = = 
 On paper , the division 's final order of battle was to consist of : 
 59th Waffen Gebirgsjäger ( Mountain Infantry ) Regiment of the SS ( three battalions ) 
 60th Waffen Gebirgsjäger Regiment of the SS ( three battalions ) 
 24th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment ( four battalions ) 
 24th SS Reconnaissance Battalion 
 24th SS Panzerjäger ( Anti @-@ tank ) Battalion 
 24th SS Pioneer Battalion 
 24th SS Mountain Signals Battalion 
 24th SS Replacement Battalion 
 The division establishment also included supply units . However , only the 59th Waffen Gebirgsjäger Regiment , one battalion of the 24th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment , one company of the 24th SS Pioneer Battalion and a half @-@ company of the divisional panzer company were ever established .

 According to Gordon Williamson , three Waffen @-@ SS officers commanded the division and subsequently the brigade :

 Douglas Wolk from Pitchfork Media commented that the DVD was " a lot closer to the mark [ of celebrating Madonna 's career ] . A lot of the fun of her career has always been its visual side . " Don Shewey from Rolling Stone said , " The video exemplified the fact that there 's no @-@ one like Madonna , who can turn the music video in to an art @-@ form . " Chad Presley from Blogcritics felt that , " There 's a healthy dose of nostalgia involved in watching these videos for anyone who grew up during the 1980s in particular . [ ... ] The video quality is a mixed bag . Most of the visual problems crop up during the earlier clips , which were photographed on much more primitive equipment . [ ... ] All things considered , especially when viewed on a Blu @-@ ray player and hi @-@ def TV , this is a pretty rough looking set . Even some of the later videos have an excess of visual noise and are lacking in sharpness . " Ian Sturges from Daily Mirror commented , " Celebration is a journey [ of Madonna ] from coquettish wannabe to pop goddess to institution . [ ... ] The videos parallel this transformation from her innocent cavorting on a Venetian gondola for ' Like a Virgin ' to the determinedly X @-@ rated couplings of ' Justify My Love ' and ' Erotica ' , both of which were banned . Monica Herrera from Billboard was not impressed with the collection and was disappointed with the " dull quality of the videos . The collection is a probable shame in Madonna 's catalogue , but a great one for her fans . " <unk> Malone from Spin said , " Celebration : The Video Collection is a reminder that Madonna is , and always will be , a true video artist . You cannot ignore her contribution to the music video art form . " Tim Sendra from Allmusic gave the DVD four and a half stars out of five , and commented that " it is indeed a celebration of Madonna 's career and some of the most celebratory and thrilling pop music ever created .

 = Ernest Lucas Guest = 
 Sir Ernest Lucas Guest KBE , CMG , CVO , LLD ( 20 August 1882 – 20 September 1972 ) was a Rhodesian politician , lawyer and soldier . He held senior ministerial positions in the government , most notably as Minister for Air during the Second World War . 
 Guest was born in Grahamstown , Cape Colony . His grandfather had moved the family there , leaving Kidderminster , England , where it had been in the printing business for three generations . He saw active service in the Second Boer War , enlisting despite being underage , and again in the First World War , when he was injured in France . His legal career began while back in Southern Rhodesia between those two wars . He won a case against Sir Charles Coghlan , at the time Premier of Southern Rhodesia , and Coghlan invited him to become a partner in his firm , which became known as Coghlan , Welsh & Guest . On his return from the First World War , Guest took responsibility for the Salisbury practice . 
 He was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1928 as a member of Coghlan 's Rhodesia Party , representing the constituency of Charter , which he held until 1946 . He first became a cabinet minister in Godfrey Huggins ' government , appointed Minister of Mines and Public Works in June 1938 . During the Second World War , Guest was Minister for Air and administered the Rhodesia Air Training Group . After the war he was also Minister of Defence , Minister of Finance and Leader of the House . At the 1946 elections he stood for Salisbury Gardens and held the seat until his retirement from office in 1948 . 
 He married Edith May Jones and had two daughters and twin sons , both of whom were killed in action during the Second World War . At his death , both the High Court and Parliament paid public tributes to him . His continuing legacy is most evident in the Kariba Dam , a project that went ahead with his active support .

 Ernest Lucas Guest was born in Grahamstown , Cape Colony ( in modern South Africa 's Eastern Cape province ) on 20 August 1882 . Guest 's grandfather had moved the family to South Africa in 1861 from Kidderminster , England , where they had been involved in the printing business for three generations . His grandfather was appointed manager of the Frontier Times , printed and published in Grahamstown . The family resided there until 1889 when Ernest 's father , Herbert Melville Guest , moved them to Klerksdorp , Transvaal , after buying the local newspaper and printing business .

 = = = Second Boer War = = = 
 At the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899 , Guest was below the minimum age of 18 for enlisting . He nevertheless managed to join the First City Volunteers , a Grahamstown regiment in which his father had served . Its task of guarding a bridge over a railway line was unappealing , so he took the opportunity of joining the Eastern Province Light Horse , attached to the Highland Brigade , which was recruiting volunteers who could both ride and shoot . Early in the Brigade 's advance into the Orange Free State on its way to the relief of Kimberley , Guest got food poisoning and he returned to Grahamstown . 
 After recovering , he joined the Kimberley Mounted Corps and guided two officers from <unk> to Klerksdorp , where they persuaded the Boers to surrender by bluffing that a strong British force was following close behind . The Boers soon retook the town and Guest was captured . He was sent with other prisoners to <unk> to be executed but he managed to escape and travelled to <unk> . After satisfying the authorities that he had actually been taken prisoner and had not surrendered voluntarily , he returned to his depot at Kimberley . His unit had been disbanded and he was discharged . 
 Guest joined up again , enlisting in Kitchener 's Fighting Scouts on 2 January 1901 . He was given the rank of Sergeant , chasing Boer <unk> without success . He was recommended for a commission and posted to the Johannesburg Mounted Rifles , whose Colonel decided that Guest was too young to lead a force composed of miners who were considerably older than him . Returning to Klerksdorp , Guest learned that the Bechuanaland Rifles were recruiting experienced officers ; he went to Mafeking and was accepted into the unit , with whom he served until the end of the war . The Rifles were part of a mobile force , the Divisional Scouting Corps , whose function was to round up Boer detachments and to execute Kitchener 's scorched earth policy , destroying Boer farm buildings and crops , and detaining women and children in concentration camps . 
 = = = First World War = = = 
 Great Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914 , and as part of the British Empire , Southern Rhodesia was also now at war . The British South Africa Company ( which then administered the territory ) took no steps to aid recruiting for the forces , so many men paid their own fares to England to join up . A number of eligible recruits could not afford to go , so Guest , together with Captain Alwyn Knowles of the Bedfordshire Regiment , who as a reserve officer was awaiting his call @-@ up , organised a private fund to pay their passages . When the recruits arrived in England they were enlisted by Captain ( later Colonel ) John Banks Brady ( who was in 1934 to be elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly as member for Bulawayo North ) to form a Rhodesian platoon in the King 's Royal Rifle Corps . 
 Guest and Knowles were summoned to the Defence Department and told to stop recruiting . The Administration had decided to raise a regiment in Rhodesia , and Guest joined the Salisbury battalion of the 1st Rhodesian Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant . The battalion was sent to South Africa to assist in suppressing the 1914 Maritz Rebellion by Boers opposed to fighting for Britain . It was not , however , deployed against the Rebellion and when it ended the battalion was sent , with the Imperial Light Horse , to reinforce the South African troops in the South @-@ West Africa Campaign in German South @-@ West Africa , present @-@ day Namibia . They landed at Lambert 's Bay on Christmas morning 1914 , but made no contact with the enemy until they were sent to Swakopmund . 
 When the campaign came to an end , the battalion returned to Salisbury . Guest then travelled to England and sought a commission , joining the South Lancashire Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant in September 1916 . He was later promoted to Captain . He went with his battalion to France where they were posted to the 59th Division , then in the line . The sector they occupied was not very active , but shelling and sniping from both sides were carried out fairly regularly . It was not long before Guest was wounded , and then he fell victim to an irritating and persistent skin complaint which was common in the trenches and did not respond to treatment . He was evacuated to England and after a brief period in hospital was sent to the Imperial Hydro at St Annes , where he was told that he would not be fit to return to his unit for six months . 
 Through a contact at the War Office , Guest had his name added to a list of officers available for special employment , and was selected to undertake a propaganda tour of the United States , delivering 160 lectures to approximately 282 @,@ 000 people in total . He was then sent to France to promote the benefits of Southern Rhodesia to the large number of soldiers who had become unsettled and wished to emigrate . Guest then returned to Rhodesia with his family , who had spent most of the war in England . 
 Other members of the Guest family also served in the First World War . Ivor Guest , Ernest 's eldest brother , was a lieutenant in the Witwatersrand Rifles in the South @-@ West Africa Campaign . After the regiment was disbanded at the end of the campaign , he was commissioned as a machine gun officer in the Second Cape Corps for service in East Africa ; he was killed in action in November 1917 at the Battle of Mahiwa while checking the advance of a vastly superior enemy force . His gun crew had become casualties and he was handling the gun himself when he was killed . 
 Guest 's two younger brothers also served in the Transvaal Scottish . The elder of them , Duke , was later commissioned in the South African Scottish and served in France . He was gassed and after a long stay in hospital was declared unfit for further service and remained in England until the end of the war . 
 = = Legal career = = 
 = = = Admission to the Rhodesian Court = = = 
 At the start of the Second Boer War , Guest had left school without any educational qualifications . Nevertheless , he managed to start his legal career when a Klerksdorp solicitor , Maurice Rood , offered him a job drawing up claims for compensation by farmers whose properties had been destroyed or damaged by the British forces . The claims were to be submitted to the " Compensation Committee " , on which Guest 's father served . When the committee ceased to function Rood suggested that Guest become articled to him . 
 The need to matriculate was an obstacle . He used a family connection with St. Andrew 's College , Grahamstown , to attend as a day boy and passed his matriculation . He duly applied to the Supreme Court for admission as an attorney in the Transvaal , was accepted and took the oath . He was offered a post with the leading firm of attorneys in Klerksdorp , but a clause in his articles prohibited Guest from practising in competition with Rood 's firm for some years without the latter 's permission . 
 Guest became acquainted with Fred Hopley , who had recently been practising in Bulawayo . He informed Guest that a solicitor in Bulawayo , Louis Champion , wanted someone to take over his practice for six months while he was away on a shooting trip . Guest 's application was accepted by return of post and he was asked to report early in July 1910 . Champion 's practice , as Deputy Sheriff , consisted mainly of debt @-@ collecting and lending money to doubtful borrowers at a high rate of interest . 
 Guest prepared his petition for admission to the Rhodesian Court and briefed counsel to represent him before the Chief Justice , Sir Joseph Vintcent . The Judge dispensed with the requirement to apply first for admission in the Cape Colony and admitted him as an attorney of the High Court of Southern Rhodesia . 
 A few days after Guest 's arrival a young man arrived to practise in Bulawayo as an advocate , Robert Hudson . So began a friendship that was to endure for the rest of Hudson 's life and through many vicissitudes – in the legal profession , on active service in the First World War , and during the years when they were both members of the Cabinet . Hudson , who for some years was Minister of Justice , became Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia . 
 = = = Coghlan , Welsh & Guest = = = 
 Bryce Hendrie , whose office was next door to Louis Champion 's , had been appointed Commanding Officer of the Rhodesian contingent to attend the coronation of King George V on 22 June 1911 . Before his departure to England , he offered Guest the management of his practice during his absence . Hendrie 's brother was an estate agent and put all his property transfers through the firm , so Guest gained much valuable experience , especially in conveyancing , through a number of cases in the High Court , in the Magistrate 's Court and in the Court of the Mining Commissioner . 
 Guest came up against Sir Charles Coghlan , the senior partner of Coghlan and Welsh , in a case before the Court of the Mining Commissioner . Coghlan represented a mining company , which had pegged some gold claims on Guest 's client 's farm . The Commissioner gave judgment in favour of Guest , who had been instructed to oppose their registration . Following this case , although initially irritated by Guest , Coghlan invited him to join his firm in Salisbury , which Guest did in January 1912 . The Salisbury office had been opened by Bernard Tancred . His passing away provided the opportunity for Guest to join the firm as a partner . For a while , the firm was known as Coghlan , Welsh , Townsend and Guest , when Townsend , one of the 1820 Settlers in the Eastern Cape , joined the firm in Salisbury . It reverted to Coghlan , Welsh and Guest , when Townsend died a little time later . 
 On his return to Rhodesia after the First World War , Guest took over the Salisbury practice from Sir Charles , who returned to Bulawayo .

 After the First World War , Guest became involved in municipal affairs . He served on a committee to help returning soldiers adjust to civilian life . He was elected to the Salisbury Town Council , and during his second term was appointed Deputy Mayor . For the best part of a year , he acted as Mayor during the Mayor 's absence in the United States . 
 Guest was one of several prominent citizens who were members of the Rhodesian Union Association , advocating joining the Union of South Africa in the 1922 government referendum ; the alternative option was " responsible government " , under which Southern Rhodesia would become a self @-@ governing colony of Britain in its own right . The electorate returned a vote for the latter proposition , and in October 1923 Coghlan became the first Premier of Southern Rhodesia . Although Guest was on the opposite side to Coghlan the statesman was impressed by his capabilities , and when he drew up a list of those he would like to see stand for election to the next Legislative Assembly , just before his death , he put Guest 's name at the head of it . Guest first stood for Charter , representing the Rhodesia Party at the 1928 elections . Despite the constituency being largely Afrikaans , he won the seat , defeating the incumbent Charles Edward Gilfillan of the Progressive Party with a majority of 283 votes to 211 . He held Charter until 1946 , being re @-@ elected in 1933 , 1934 ( unopposed ) and 1939 . At the 1946 elections he stood for Salisbury Gardens and won , remaining there until his retirement from politics in 1948 . 
 = = = Cabinet Minister = = = 
 At the 1933 elections , the Rhodesia Party was defeated by the Reform Party of Godfrey Huggins . Guest was a key advocate of accepting the merger of the two parties under the new name of the United Party and Huggins appointed him to his Cabinet in 1938 . 
 Guest was Minister of Mines and Public Works , from 1 June 1938 to 1 February 1944 . The Electricity Supply Commission came under his portfolio . It had responsibility for ensuring that the generation of electricity kept pace with the ever · growing needs of mining , farming and secondary industry . When Guest became Minister the Commission was constructing a thermal power station at <unk> , but kept running short of money . The Minister of Finance , Jacob Smit , was reluctant to grant further funds but would support a hydro @-@ electric scheme . Guest proposed Kariba as a source of hydro @-@ electric power and Smit provided the money for further investigation . Guest arranged with a civil engineer named Jeffares , who had earlier surveyed the route of the proposed <unk> / Kafue railway and knew the country around Kariba , to survey the area , select a site for a power station and submit a report . When he eventually did so , Guest appointed a committee of engineers to examine the proposal . They reported favourably but did not recommend that the scheme be proceeded with immediately . Nor was the Cabinet particularly impressed , and the idea was strongly criticised by the Opposition in Parliament . The outbreak of the Second World War caused the project to be shelved but after the war the project was revived as a joint scheme to serve the two Rhodesias .

It was decided not to create a full Rhodesian formation : if it were wiped out , the colony 's future prosperity would be put at risk . Instead mostly small groups of Rhodesians were distributed throughout the British Army , Navy and Air Force . In the Defence Report of 1939 , it was stated that forces would be trained and organised not only for internal security and defence but also to defend British interests in service outside its borders . 
 = = = = Empire Air Training Scheme = = = = 
 As early as 1936 , an air training scheme was inaugurated at Cranborne , near Salisbury , where the civilian flying school instructed pilots . Facilities were later extended to Bulawayo . In August 1937 , Squadron Leader <unk> Powell and Flight Lieutenant V.E. Maxwell were seconded from the RAF to oversee service training . In September 1939 , the Rhodesian Air Training Group , under the direction of Air Vice Marshal ( later Sir ) Charles Warburton Meredith , took in 500 recruits at Cranborne . An offer was made to British Air Ministry to run a flying school and to train personnel to man three squadrons , which was duly accepted . 
 The Southern Rhodesia Air Force effectively ceased to exist after its last training course was completed on 6 April 1940 . Its three squadrons became 44 , 237 and 266 Squadrons , Royal Air Force , bearing the name of Rhodesia . The Rhodesian Air Training Group invited the public to submit design proposals for the Squadrons ' crests .

 Meanwhile , preparations were underway in Rhodesia to expand facilities for the training of pilots . In January 1940 the government announced the creation of a Department of Air , completely separate from that of Defence . Guest was appointed Minister of Air , a post he held from 28 March 1940 to 6 May 1946 . He inaugurated and administered what became the second largest Empire Air Training Scheme , beginning with the establishment of three units at Salisbury , Bulawayo and Gwelo , each comprising a preliminary and an advanced training school . 
 Rhodesia was the last of the Commonwealth countries to enter the Empire Air Training Scheme and the first to turn out fully qualified pilots . No.25 Elementary Flying Training School at Belvedere Air Station , Salisbury , was the first school to be opened , on 25 May 1940 by Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke @-@ Popham . It was followed by a Service School at Cranborne . In Bulawayo , an Elementary School was established at <unk> , although due to the unsuitability of the ground surface , it was moved to <unk> , with a Service School at <unk> . Gwelo had an Elementary School at Guinea Fowl and a Service School at Thornhill . The Elementary Schools were equipped with Tiger Moths and the Service Schools , single @-@ engine <unk> and twin @-@ engine Airspeed Oxfords . At Moffat , the first gunners passed out in September 1941 from the only Bombing and Gunnery School in Southern Rhodesia . 
 The trainees came mainly from Britain but also from Australia , Canada , South Africa , New Zealand , USA , Yugoslavia , Greece , France , Poland , Czechoslovakia , Kenya , Uganda , Tanganyika , Fiji and Malta . In total 8 @,@ 500 British aircrew were trained in Southern Rhodesia during the War .

 No. 1 Squadron , Southern Rhodesia Air Force , was among the units posted to East African Force in Kenya in September 1939 to undertake the role of army co @-@ operation , including reconnaissance and air @-@ photography work , as well as dive @-@ bombing operations and ground @-@ strafing , and conducting artillery shoots . On 22 April 1940 , the squadron was renamed No. 237 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron , Royal Air Force and took the Latin motto Primum <unk> in <unk> ( The Vanguard in the Sky ) , being Rhodesia 's first in the field . 
 In September 1940 , 237 Squadron was relieved by units of the South <unk> Air Force and redeployed in Sudan , where the Operations Record for the last three months of 1940 showed it was involved in reconnaissance , dive @-@ bombing and pamphlet @-@ dropping . At the start of 1941 , the Squadron was re @-@ equipped with less antiquated aircraft . The Hardys were replaced by Westland Lysander II army co @-@ operation planes as well as Gloster Gladiator fighter biplanes . 237 Squadron moved out of East Africa after the defeat of the Italians in May 1941 . They had seen active service in Kenya , Sudan , Eritrea and Abyssinia . The Squadron was involved in the Western Desert Campaign against Rommel . After a lull in the summer of 1941 , it took heavy casualties in the closing months inflicted on it by <unk> and Macchis . It was withdrawn to the Canal Zone in February 1942 after five months in the Western Desert . 
 The Squadron 's crest was presented to it by Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder on 30 March 1942 .

 266 Squadron , RAF , was formed at RAF Sutton Bridge on 30 October 1939 . The majority of the Squadron were Rhodesian , with the exception of a few <unk> and the commanding officer . Equipped with Spitfires , it was the Rhodesian fighter squadron and it took as its motto a Sindebele word <unk> ( Stabber of Skies ) . It first went into action over Dunkirk on 2 June 1940 . By June 1941 , the Squadron , led by Sqn Ldr T.B. de la P. Beresford , was stationed at RAF Wittering , near Peterborough . Its duties included patrolling , escorting convoys , offensive sweeps of northern France and the Belgian and Dutch coasts , as well as escorting bombing raids over France and the Rhine . In January 1942 , the Squadron received Hawker Typhoons and later in the month moved to Duxford .

 44 Squadron , RAF , stationed at Waddington , south of Lincoln , was renamed 44 ( Rhodesia ) Squadron in September 1941 , and took as its motto <unk> Regis Justa ( The King 's thunderbolts are righteous ) . The bomber Squadron , equipped with Hampdens , took part in raids on Berlin and many other targets , as well as mine @-@ laying in sea traffic lanes . 
 It was also in September 1941 that the Squadron received the proto @-@ type Lancaster bomber , the first squadron of the RAF to receive the new aircraft . On a visit to the Squadron in December , Guest and Meredith were taken on a flight in the new plane . Although the order was given in December to cease operations in the Hampdens , it was not until 3 March 1942 that the Lancaster was put on active service on its first battle mission for the entire RAF . The Squadron , with its Lancasters , was given key targets to bomb : on 17 April 1942 , six Lancasters from 44 Squadron alongside six from 97 Squadron , bombed the MAN diesel engine factory , which produced more than half of the German U @-@ boats , as well as engines for ships , tanks and transport vehicles . The success – at a cost of five planes and crew to 44 Squadron – earned the thanks of the Prime Minister himself . The Squadron was further involved in the obliteration of Rostock on 8 May and took part in the 1 @,@ 000 @-@ aircraft attack on Cologne on 30 May .

 From 1944 , Guest was Leader of the House until he retired from political office in 1948 . He retained his wartime role as Air Minister and Rhodesia capitalised on her experience to form her own highly efficient Air Force . He also tackled the problem of young airmen returning to civilian life , training aircrews for civilian duty as well as helping young men complete their academic education . He continued as Minister of Defence and Air from 7 June 1946 to 15 September 1948 . He chaired the South African Air Transport Council in its deliberations in 1947 regarding air traffic control and the establishment of control centres at Nairobi , Salisbury and Johannesburg , as well as communications and the future needs of air transport in southern Africa . 
 During this time , he was also Minister of Internal Affairs from 1944 to 1946 and briefly Minister of Finance from 7 May 1946 to 26 September 1946 . He acted as Prime Minister at various times in 1947 and 1948 during the absence of Huggins and acted for other ministers on a number of occasions . 
 Although he had retired from political office , Guest continued to be active in public life , for example in organising the 1953 Rhodes Centenary Exhibition in Southern Rhodesia .

 Tales of Vesperia ( Japanese : テイルズ オブ ヴェスペリア , Hepburn : Teiruzu Obu <unk> ) is a Japanese role @-@ playing video game developed by Namco Tales Studio for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) . The tenth mainline entry in the Tales , it was published in Japan and North America by Namco Bandai Games in 2008 , and in European territories by Atari in 2009 . An expanded port of the game for the PS3 was released in 2009 in Japan , but has not been released in Western territories . The gameplay is similar to previous Tales games , featuring a new version of the series ' trademark action @-@ based Linear Motion Battle System , while also introducing new elements such as online scoring boards . 
 Vesperia is set in the world of Terca Lumireis , which uses an energy source called blastia for all its needs , including creating protective barriers around its cities . The story focuses on Yuri Lowell , a former Imperial soldier who forms a guild called Brave Vesperia to aid Estelle , a noble woman he encounters on a mission . As they explore the world , Brave Vesperia are challenged by factions who have different plans related to the abuse of blastia resources , and Yuri is forced to confront his friend and former comrade Flynn . The game 's story theme is justice , and its Characteristic Genre Name is " RPG to Enforce Justice " ( <unk> , <unk> o <unk> RPG ) . 
 Preliminary work on Vesperia began in 2005 . Full development began in May of the following year and lasted approximately two years . Returning staff included producer Yoshito Higuchi , composers Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura , and character designer Kōsuke Fujishima . The writers included Takashi Hasegawa and Hideo Baba . Developed by the same team that made Tales of Symphonia and Tales of the Abyss , it was designed for the Xbox 360 as the PS3 had yet to be shown to the company and the former console was achieving international popularity . The anime cutscenes were created by Production I.G , with an art style influenced by cel @-@ shaded animation . The game 's theme song , Ring a Bell by Bonnie Pink , was used for both the Japanese and English releases . Upon release , the game was an international commercial success , selling over 600 @,@ 000 copies worldwide . Critical reception has been generally positive , and further media related to the world of Vesperia has been developed . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Tales of Vesperia is a role @-@ playing video game set in a fantasy world featuring three @-@ dimensional environments and characters . The game 's environments are split into two types . On the field map , the main characters navigate reduced @-@ scale environments . A compass and mini @-@ map are displayed , along with towns , other named locations , and enemy icons . Striking an enemy icon triggers a battle , while interacting with a town causes the party to enter it . In battle and towns or similar locations , characters move around environments built on a lifelike scale relative to the human characters . In these areas , the party may interact with non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) . Within these environments , items such as crates came be moved by the currently @-@ assigned character . After a certain point in the game , an item called the Sorcerer 's Ring is given to the party , enabling them to shoot bolts of energy . These bolts can be used to activate switches , move objects , and attack enemies from a distance . Save points can be found in dungeons and towns . Items such as equipment and weapons are purchased with Gald , the in @-@ game currency . While in environments , players can trigger optional character conversations called Skits . In Skits , characters are represented by head @-@ and @-@ shoulder portraits , and the conversations can range from dramatic to comedic . 
 Characters have several different stats and gauges : their health ( HP ) , a magic meter stocked by Technical Points ( TP ) , and Learning Points ( LP ) for learning <unk> a character 's respective agility or luck , and how a character reacts to attacks . Attack types are physical and magical , while defense is limited to physical attacks . Characters gain experience levels through accumulating experience points ( EXP ) . EXP and Gald is earned through battles , along with recovering a degree of TP and occasionally items dropped by defeated enemies . Skills , attributes that change different stats , can be assigned to each character . The number of skills that can be assigned is calculated by the number of skill points each character has available . Battling with equipment associated with a particular skill enables that character to learn it when they have filled their LP meter . Cooking , creating meals with ingredients found in battle or around explored environments , can also be used by individual characters to restore their HP and TP and grant temporary enhancements . Recipes are learned from a character called the Wonder Chef . 
 = = = Battle system = = = 
 Vesperia uses a variation on the series ' trademark action @-@ oriented Linear Motion Battle System ( LMBS ) , which plays out in a similar way to a fighting game . The variation used in Vesperia is called the " Evolved Flex @-@ Range LMBS " . Battles take place in an isolated battle arena within the environment , with the battle party being made up of one player @-@ controlled character and three characters controlled by the game 's artificial intelligence ( AI ) . The AI commands can be customized from a set of skills , with their assigned tasks affecting their actions and placement on the battlefield . Vesperia also features a local four @-@ player multiplayer option : up to four players can connect to a single Xbox 360 console through both wired and wireless controllers . While no online multiplayer is available , players can use Xbox Live to post their respective scores , including damage chains and consecutive hit numbers , on online leaderboards . The boards can be updated by players while saving the game . 
 Enemies , encountered in environments as icons , react differently depending on how they are approached and attacked : using the right attack or approaching them unawares grants the party an advantage in battle . If other groups of enemies are close by , they are also drawn into the initiated battle . For both player characters and enemies , battle skills and character performance can be affected by elemental attributes . Status ailments can also be inflicted by both the party and enemies . They are divided into physical ailments and magical ailments , which have a variety of negative effects : physical effects can be effects like slowing or poisoning a character , while magical ailments can cause units to turn on their allies or automatically recover a knocked @-@ out party member . Items used on characters can restore TP or HP , or remove status ailments . Characters learn new skills during battles , along with Titles that affect aspects of characters . 
 In battle , players can perform multiple actions : walking or running along a fixed axis , freely running around the battlefield , jumping in any direction , guarding against attacks , and pausing the battle to select a different enemy to attack . Characters can launch various attacks , from standard strikes to strikes that can interrupt enemy attacks . The player character 's attacks can be chained together to create combo attacks , which create a continual flow of attacks without giving the enemy a chance to attack . Continual strikes activate the change for a Fatal Strike , which kills normal enemies and heavily damages bosses . Landing successive Fatal Strikes grants bonuses at the end of the battle . During battle , landing successive strikes without taking hits fill an Over Limit meter . Once the meter is full , the player character can perform continual attacks and cast Artes without casting time during the Over Limit 's duration . During battles , Secret Mission can be triggered by performing unspecified actions . Completing Secret Missions grants a bonus to the battle grade or acquire an item . All characters can use Artes , special physical and magical abilities which can range from standard attacks to healing magic . Learned by leveling up a character , Artes can be both specifically directed and have a general area of effect . Four Artes can be assigned to each character , and each Arte can be assigned to a hot key . Some Artes can be used outside battle to cure characters . In addition to standard Artes , each character can access Mystic Arts , extra @-@ powerful cinematic attacks .

 The people of Terca Lumireis rely on an energy source called " blastia " , devices created by the Krytia from using the crystallized remains of a powerful race known as the Entelexeia . <unk> are powered using a mystical substance known as " aer " and were used to provide resources and protection to major cities . In ancient times , misuse of blastia by the Krytia prompted the Entelexeia to absorb the excess aer generated by blastia abuses : consuming too much aer to handle , a group of Entelexeia transformed into a monster known as the Adephagos , which would consume every living thing on the planet by converting it into aer and absorbing it . Sacrificing humans with the innate ability to convert aer into magical energy , known as " Children of the Full Moon " , they created a barrier to seal away the Adephagos . The remaining Children of the Full Moon and the Entelexeia decided on the new arrangement of the world : in future times , an unnamed Empire rules over large portions of Terca Lumireis , with the Children 's descendants being its ruling family . Ten years prior to the events of Vesperia , a new form of blastia was developed that could seriously damage Terca Lumireis ' ecosystem and potentially release the Adephagos . The Entelexeia attempted to warn humanity in vain , and when they attempted to destroy the new blastia , they were defeated in a war . One of the veterans of the Great War , Duke , is utterly disillusioned with humanity after his Entelexeia companion <unk> is seen as a potential threat and killed . 
 In the present , former Imperial knight Yuri Lowell goes on a mission to retrieve his neighborhood 's blastia core from a nobleman when their reservoir fails . While on his mission , he encounters a noble woman called Estelle , and flees with her from the capital in pursuit of the blastia thief . On their journey , they also meet Karol , a trainee hunter separated from his guild ; a blastia researcher named Rita ; Raven , a Great War veteran ; Judith , a Krytia who seeks to destroy the blastia harming the aer balance ; and exclusive to the PS3 version only , seemingly the descender of a legendary pirate <unk> named Patty Fleur . Together , the group recover the stolen core from a corrupt guild leader and return it to Yuri 's friend and former fellow knight Flynn . Yuri and Karol then decide to form an independent guild called Brave Vesperia . Shortly after this , Estelle is attacked by an Entelexeia called <unk> , who accuses her of poisoning the planet . After investigating and meeting a second time with <unk> , Brave Vesperia learn that Estelle is a Child of the Full Moon , capable of converting aer into magic without the aid of a blastia core , and that her actions are causing the aer <unk> , the sources of aer , to <unk> aer with deadly results . Alongside these events , Yuri sees that the Imperial authorities are powerless to act against powerful figures involved in blastia abuse : he takes matters into his own hands and murders two officials connected to the abuses . These acts put a strain on his friendship with Flynn . 
 After this , Estelle is kidnapped by Raven , revealed to be an agent of Commandant Alexei , leader of the Knights and the mastermind behind the blastia thefts : Alexei intends to use Estelle 's power and the replica of a magical sword to activate an ancient weapon called the Enduring Shrine of Zaude and remake the world , erasing the harmful blastia . After Raven decides to remain with Brave Vesperia after helping Estelle to escape with them , the group travel to Zaude to stop Alexei . They fail , and as Zaude is activated , it is revealed to be a barrier generator which kept the Adephagos sealed off from the world . As the Adephagos is released , Alexei is killed as Zaude collapses and Yuri is separated from the group after one of Flynn 's subordinates attempts to kill him without Flynn 's knowledge . Rescued by Duke , Yuri decides to stop the Adaphagos . During his absence , Rita discovers a means of converting blastia cores into spirits , which can process aer into a less @-@ dangerous alternate energy called mana , stabilizing the aer <unk> and keeping Estelle 's powers in check . In turn , the mana could power a weapon capable of destroying the Adephagos . After receiving permission from the world 's leaders to carry out their plan , Brave Vesperia must confront Duke aboard the city @-@ sized weapon <unk> . Duke intends to convert all of human life , including himself , into energy to power the weapon and destroy the Adephagos , returning the world to a more primal state of being . While they share some goals , they are forced to fight due to their conflicting methods . After defeating Duke , Yuri attempts to use the converted blastia energy against Adaphagos , but it proves insufficient . Moved by Brave Vesperia 's efforts , Duke provides the extra power and Adaphagos is destroyed . The Entelexeia that formed the Adaphagos are then converted into spirits to revitalize the planet . A post @-@ credits scene shows Brave Vesperia continuing their adventures .

 Preliminary work for Tales of Vesperia began in 2005 during the later development stages of Tales of the Abyss , which released that year . Due to the success of Abyss , Vesperia was initially planned as a title for the PlayStation 2 . However , upon seeing the projected lifespan of sixth @-@ generation consoles , the executives at Namco Bandai informed the team that Abyss would be the last Tales title of that generation . In addition to this , the team felt limited by the previous generation 's hardware . In response , they decided to make the next flagship installment on next @-@ generation hardware . At the time when a platform was chosen , the PlayStation 3 had yet to be shown to the company and the Xbox 360 was highly popular in the west , so they settled on the latter . Being on that platform , the team were also able to make use of Xbox Live , enabling trophy and online ranking implementation . During areas of development , the team were in communication with Microsoft about how to best utilize the platform . Full development began in May 2006 , taking approximately two years to complete . The development team , dubbed " Team Symphonia " , was the same group that developed Abyss and the 2003 entry Tales of Symphonia . While designing the battle system , the team drew inspiration from the version used in Abyss . 
 During the early production phases , the team was torn between a cel @-@ shaded anime or realistic style of art direction : they eventually settled on an anime style and production went fairly smoothly from there on . The shaders for the characters were designed using the game 's drawing engine , as opposed to the hand @-@ drawn shaders of characters in Abyss . The game 's director Yoshito Higuchi originally wanted a realistic feel after the cartoon @-@ like styling and shader techniques of Abyss and the Wii spin @-@ off title Tales of Symphonia : Dawn of the New World . One of the challenges this presented for the background designers was adjusting for the advent of LCD televisions . The positive aspect of this was that more colors could be displayed than on cathode ray tubes . In hindsight , it was felt that the final effect lacked the desired polish . The anime cutscenes were created by Production I.G , with the number and length increasing from previous titles . 
 The scenario was written by Takashi Hasegawa , who had written for multiple series entries since Tales of Eternia ; <unk> Matsumoto , who had written the scenario of Tales of Legendia ; Hideo Baba , who had previously done work on Tales of Rebirth ; and Takaaki Okuda , a newcomer to the series . The game 's title , meant to be indicative of the games ' theme of justice , was derived from " Vesper " , a name referring to the planet Venus . Its general meaning was to depict the protagonists and their ship as a newly @-@ born star shining on the land , similar to Venus in the evening sky . The logo was also design to convey this , and the term " Vesperia " was used in @-@ game for the party 's airship . The game 's main protagonist , Yuri Lowell , was created to be a more mature , evolved protagonist than Kyle Dunamis in Tales of Destiny 2 or Luke fon Fabre in Abyss . His role was to facilitate the growth of the other characters , and to have a sense of justice that did not take account of the law . Veteran Tales character designer , Kōsuke Fujishima , was brought in to design the main characters . Fujishima found designing Yuri difficult , while Flynn proved one of the easiest designs . One of the intentions for Flynn and Yuri was for their designs to contrast with each other . A main character not designed by Fujishima was Repede , who was designed by the art director Daigo Okumura . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music was composed by Motoi Sakuraba , who had composed for nearly all the previous Tales games , and his regular partner Shinji Tamura , the latter working under the alias Hibiki Aoyama . While creating the soundtrack , Sakuraba was caught in the transition between sequenced to prerecorded streamed music , the latter of which gave room for rearrangements and improvisation mid @-@ production . Sequenced music had been used up to Abyss , so it was the first time in the series that Sakuraba used this method , although he had done so for all his other projects at the time . For some tracks , a heavy piano element was used , with Sakuraba playing the instrument . Tamura worked with Sakuraba to create different feelings for the various tracks : character themes were melodic , dungeon themes were given a simple and minimalist mood , while town themes struck a balance between these two approaches . In addition to original tracks , three remixed tracks from other Namco Bandai games were included . 
 The game 's theme song , " Ring a Bell " , was sung by Japanese singer @-@ songwriter Bonnie Pink , and was the first theme song to be shared by both the Japanese and western versions of a Tales game . The song 's subject matter , inspired by the game 's story and themes , focused on deep friendship between men , and by extension love between men and women . Bonnie Pink was chosen by the producers after a long period of internal consultation . They contacted Warner Music Japan , Bonnie Park 's label company , fairly early in the game 's production , and discussed the theme song 's connection to the story at great length . Bonnie Pink was also chosen as part of the team 's plans for an international release , as they wanted to create an English version of the song for the Western release . Bonnie both wrote the original lyrics and translated them into English . Arrangements of " Ring a Bell " are used in some tracks in the main soundtrack , but the song itself is not included on the soundtrack album .

 Vesperia was first announced in December 2007 at that year 's Jump Festa for a 2008 release in Japan , although its planned platform was not revealed . The game 's characteristic genre name , a recurring feature for the series representative of the game 's theme , is " RPG to Enforce Justice " ( <unk> , <unk> o <unk> RPG ) . It represents Yuri 's feelings and personal goals . It was announced for a 2008 overseas release on Xbox 360 in February 2008 . It was later confirmed that it would release for that platform in Japan . In a first for the series , the team wanted to have a simultaneous worldwide release for the title , and so were developing the localized version alongside the original . This process proved exhausting . The team were able to make the skits , the game 's extra conversation pieces , fully voice in the western version , which they were not able to do for Abyss or Symphonia because of time constraints . The translation was done by 8 @-@ 4 , and dubbed by Cup of Tea Productions . 
 The game released in Japan on August 7 , 2008 . Alongside the standard release , the game was packaged with an Xbox 360 Premium Edition . The game released in North America on August 26 , just under three weeks after its Japanese release . In July , a demo for the game was released via Xbox Live . Along with the standard edition , a Special Edition bundled with a CD featuring selected music from previous games was released to celebrate the series ' tenth anniversary in the west . The European release , which came nearly a year after the game 's North American release , was handled by Atari . The game released in Europe on June 26 , 2009 . The game was released in Australia on June 25 , 2009 . 
 = = = PlayStation 3 port = = = 
 A port of the game for the PlayStation 3 was announced in April 2009 . The port features full voice acting , containing nearly twice as much voice work as the original voice script , which covers previously unvoiced cutscenes in the 360 version . The game also features various new characters , has Flynn as a permanent playable character , and adds a new playable character in the form of Patty Fleur . Development on the port began in 2008 , after the release of the original version . Speaking on why the port was being developed , a developer who worked on Vampire Rain said that companies like Namco Bandai first developed for the Xbox 360 due to superior funding and development support when compared to Sony , then ported to PS3 with minimal effort so they could recoup development costs and add features that needed to be cut from the original game . 
 The port was released on September 17 , 2009 . It was later re @-@ released as part of Sony 's budget series release on August 2 , 2012 . Speaking in January 2010 , Namco Bandai announced that they had no plans to release the port overseas . Later that year , Yuri 's English voice actor Troy Baker said that he had been recording new English dialogue for the PS3 port . A report from a Namco Bandai employee sparked speculation that the reason behind the lack of a localization was due to a deal with Microsoft to keep the game as an Xbox 360 exclusive in western territories . Later , she retracted this statement , apologizing for creating false impressions . Series producer Hideo Baba later said that the main factor in this decision was the strain put on the team with the simultaneous release of the original , meaning a Japan @-@ exclusive release was chosen to lessen the burden . This also coincided with poor marketing feedback for the series in western territories .

In GameSpot 's own similar awards , it was nominated for awards in the " Special Achievement - Best Story " and " Special Achievement - Best Graphics , Artistic " categories . The year after its release , Technology Tell cited it as one of the best Tales games to have come overseas . 
 Famitsu gave the game a strong review , with one reviewer calling it " [ one ] of the most outstanding games in the series " , giving it a Platinum award and giving it the highest score out of the game 's reviewed in that edition of the magazine . Eurogamer 's Simon Parkin said that , while lacking the big @-@ budget look of other JRPG series and sticking to many of the genre 's conventions , " Namco is to be applauded for updating the series with no small amount of consideration and flair , an effort that has resulted in the strongest entry to the aging series yet " . Edge praised the cast 's strength and the battle system , saying that the development team 's focus in other areas was what made the game enjoyable and easy to play . Andrew Fitch , writing for 1UP.com , greatly enjoyed the technical improvement over Abyss and enjoyed the battle system and other elements including some mature plot elements , but noted translation issues in the English script and a lack of end @-@ game content . As part of his review , he called it " perhaps the finest franchise entry to date " . Matt Miller of Game Informer was less positive than most other reviewers , finding the story and gameplay lacking while appreciating the graphical polish . 
 IGN 's Ryan Geddes called it " a strong anime @-@ style Japanese RPG " , generally citing the game as an enjoyable experience . Francesca Reyes , writing for Official Xbox Magazine , found some aspects of the battle system frustrating , but stated that most other aspects of the game made up for this deficiency . Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot was positive overall , despite noting a lack of strategy in a lot of battles and similarity to previous Tales games . Hardcore Gamer 's Steve <unk> called the game a good starting point for the series on then @-@ current consoles . RPGFan 's Ashton Liu said that , while it stood as perhaps the best entry in the series , he also noted that it had not evolved very much mechanically when compared to other RPG series . GameSpy 's Gabe Graziani cited it as a graphical improvement over other JRPGs on the console , and praised the characters despite citing the story as being conventional , and called it " [ a ] superior blend of style and production value " . 
 Famitsu gave the PS3 port a positive review , noting its expanded content when compared to the original and sharing many sentiments with their original review . Japanese gaming website 4Gamer.net recommended the PS3 port to both veterans of the series and to newcomers , and positively noting its expanded content . James Quentin Clark , reviewing the port for RPGFan , said that the added features had made Vesperia the best JRPG of its console generation . In conclusion , he called it " the most complete package game in the series and a must @-@ have for fans of action RPGs " .

 = 1897 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1897 Atlantic hurricane season was an inactive season , featuring only six known tropical cyclones , four of which made landfall . There were three hurricanes , none of which strengthened into major hurricanes , which are Category 3 or higher on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . The first system was initially observed south of Cape Verde on August 31 , an unusually late date . The storm was the strongest of the season , peaking as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . While located well north of the Azores , rough seas by the storm sunk a ship , killing all 45 crewmen . A second storm was first spotted in the Straits of Florida on September 10 . It strengthened into a hurricane and tracked northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico , striking Louisiana shortly before dissipating on September 13 . This storm caused 29 deaths and $ 150 @,@ 000 ( 1897 USD ) in damage . 
 The third storm developed in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on September 20 . It tracked along the East Coast of the United States , causing widespread damage , particularly in Florida . A fourth storm was first observed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on September 25 . This storm moved in a semicircular path around Cuba and was last noted offshore Florida four days later . Minor wind and flood damage was reported in Cuba . On October 9 , the fifth hurricane of the season was located near the Windward Islands . Moving westward , the storm eventually curved northeastward while crossing the Caribbean Sea , causing it to strike Cuba . Minor damage was reported on the island , though a ship sank with 230 people aboard ; 42 of them were rescued , while the remaining 188 were presumed dead . The final observed system developed in the vicinity of the Bahamas on October 23 . It later struck the Outer Banks of North Carolina ; the storm caused severe flooding in southeastern Virginia , with six deaths reported . It was last noted on October 29 . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 55 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) , which is tropical storm strength .

 The first hurricane of the season was observed near Cape Verde , beginning at 0600 UTC on August 31 . Initially a tropical storm , it slowly strengthened while heading west @-@ northwestward , reaching hurricane status on September 1 . Curving northwestward , the storm intensified further into a Category 2 hurricane on September 3 . It continued heading northwestward until curving to the northeast late on September 6 . Around 1130 UTC on the following day , the storm attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 972 mbar ( 28 @.@ 7 inHg ) . Early on September 9 , the system weakened to a Category 1 , before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone well north of the Azores later that day . The extratropical remnants continued weaken , before dissipating west of Ireland on September 10 The crew of the <unk> St. Peter reported that another ship capsized with 45 men aboard ; all of them drowned .

 A second hurricane was spotted in the Straits of Florida at tropical storm intensity on September 10 . Several hours later , the system made landfall in Marquesas Keys , Florida . Early on September 11 , it strengthened into a hurricane . Intensifying slightly further , the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) shortly thereafter . The hurricane maintained this intensity while moving west @-@ northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and struck extreme southwestern Cameron Parish , Louisiana early on September 13 . Shortly thereafter , it weakened to a tropical storm over Texas , before dissipating several hours later . 
 No impact was reported in the Florida Keys . Strong winds in southwestern Louisiana damaged crops and toppled windmills . Offshore , boats and schooners suffered severe damage from wind @-@ driven waves . Severe damage occurred in eastern Texas , with strong winds and storm surge damaging or destroying numerous buildings , houses , and crops in several cities , including Beaumont , New Sabine Pass , Orange , Sabine Pass , and Port Arthur . The storm was considered the worst in Orange since 1875 . Overall , the storm caused at least 29 fatalities in Texas , with six died at Port Arthur , three offshore , four in Sabine Pass , and sixteen others at Beaumont . Damage in the state reached approximately $ 150 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Three = = = 
 The third storm of the season was first observed in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on September 20 . Strengthening while heading northeastward , the system made landfall near Boca Grande , Florida with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) early on the following day . Heavy rainfall in Tampa caused the streets and sideways to become inundated , leaving portions of the city impassable , especially areas adjacent to the DeSoto Hotel . Two fire stations were severely damaged . On the east coast of Florida , the worst impact occurred in Cocoa , where some buildings were destroyed and others were deroofed . Further north in Fernandina Beach , ships in the harbor broke loose and tossed about , leaving considerable damage . 
 Although the storm weakened while crossing Florida , it later re @-@ strengthened after emerging into the Atlantic Ocean later on September 21 . The system moved northeastward and made landfall near Hatteras , North Carolina at 1000 UTC on September 23 , with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . In eastern North Carolina , strong winds and high tides were observed in New Bern . Shortly thereafter , it re @-@ emerged into the Atlantic Ocean . The system began weakening , while making two landfalls on September 24 , the first on Long Island , New York , and the second near New London , Connecticut . Thereafter , the storm accelerated to the northeast and weakened to a tropical depression over New Brunswick early on September 25 . Several hours later , the system dissipated offshore southeastern Labrador . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Four = = = 
 Early on September 25 , a tropical storm was spotted about 100 miles ( 160 km ) west of Grand Cayman . It moved slowly northwestward and passed near Cape San Antonio , Cuba early on September 27 . The storm then entered the Gulf of Mexico and began strengthening while curving northward . On September 28 , the system attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 010 mbar ( 30 inHg ) . Early on September 29 , the storm curved eastward and dissipated several hours later offshore Florida . In Cuba , the storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall as far east as Havana , causing flooding , " but no great damage " .

 The fifth tropical cyclone of the season was first observed near the Windward Islands on October 9 . It moved west @-@ northwestward across the Caribbean Sea and remained at that intensity for several days . The storm curved in a northwesterly direction by October 14 while located over the northwestern Caribbean Sea , and then northeastward on the following day . Eventually , it began to strengthen and reached hurricane intensity early on October 18 . Several hours later , the hurricane made landfall in modern @-@ day Sancti Spíritus Province , Cuba with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Minimal damage was reported in Cuba . However , the ship Triton sank offshore Pinar del Río Province with 230 men aboard . Forty @-@ two people were rescued by passing ships , while the remaining 188 died , including the captain , who committed suicide . 
 The system weakened while crossing Cuba and fell to tropical storm intensity early on October 19 . Around that time , the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near the central Bahamas . Crossing through the islands , the system curved north @-@ northeastward and began to accelerate . It did not re @-@ strengthen and made landfall near Cape Hatteras , North Carolina with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . Strong winds and rainfall totals ranging from 1 to 7 inches ( 25 to 178 mm ) were observed along the coast of North Carolina . Strong winds were reported in portions of the Northeastern United States , with highest wind speed being 56 mph ( 90 km / h ) , observed in Block Island , Rhode Island . <unk> into the Atlantic Ocean , this system continued rapidly northeastward , before becoming extratropical offshore New England on October 21 .

 The final tropical cyclone was located over the Bahamas on October 23 . It moved north @-@ northeastward and remained at the same intensity . By October 25 , the storm began executing a cyclonic loop while offshore the East Coast of the United States . Around that time , the system attained its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . Moving southwestward , the storm made landfall near Duck , North Carolina at 2300 UTC on October 25 , at the same intensity . Early on October 26 , the system curved southeastward and quickly moved offshore . It then moved eastward and later to the northeast , before becoming extratropical on October 29 . 
 Along much of the East Coast of the United States , the Weather Bureau warned about gales and rough seas . From Cape Hatteras , North Carolina to Maine , storm surge and tides resulted in considerable damage to boardwalks and beach cottages . In Virginia , storm surge caused a number of small crafts and a few ships to be washed ashore or destroyed . The James River rose to 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) above high tide . A few cities experienced coastal flooding , including Chincoteague and Norfolk . The Willoughby Spit was split by the tides , washing away the Old Point Comfort railroad tracks . Cedar Island was " leveled to a mere flat breath of sand " . Six fatalities were reported in Virginia , four of them from drowning in Newport News , while the other two were caused by electrocution . 
 = Hurricane Rafael = 
 Hurricane Rafael produced minor damage in the northeastern Caribbean Sea in mid @-@ October 2012 . The seventeenth named storm and ninth hurricane of the annual hurricane season , Rafael originated from a tropical wave roughly 230 mi ( 370 km ) south @-@ southeast of Saint Croix on October 12 ; because the system already contained tropical storm @-@ force winds , it skipped tropical depression status . Though initially disorganized due to moderate wind shear , a subsequent decrease allowed for shower and thunderstorm activity to develop in earnest by October 14 . While moving north @-@ northwestward the following morning , Rafael intensified into a Category 1 hurricane . A cold front off the East Coast of the United States caused the system to turn northward and eventually northeastward by October 16 , at which time Rafael attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) . As the cyclone entered a more stable atmosphere and tracked across increasingly cooler sea surface temperatures , it began extratropical transition , a process the system completed by the following afternoon . 
 As a disorganized tropical cyclone in the northeastern Caribbean , Rafael produced major flooding across the region . As much as a foot of rain fell across portions of the Lesser Antilles , causing mudslides , landslides , and river flooding . In addition , the heavy rains led to significant crop loss . Sustained winds near hurricane force were recorded on Saint Martin , while tropical storm @-@ force gusts occurred widespread . Lightning activity as a result of heavy thunderstorms caused many fires and power outages . One fatality occurred when a woman in Guadeloupe unsuccessfully attempted to drive her car across a flooded roadway . As Rafael passed just to the east of Bermuda as a hurricane , light rainfall was recorded . Gusts over 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) left hundreds of houses without electricity . Large swells from the system caused significant damage to the coastline of Nova Scotia , while many roads were washed away or obscured with debris , but overall , damage was minimal . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The formation of Hurricane Rafael is attributed to a low @-@ latitude tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on October 5 . The wave remained disorganized until roughly midway between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles , at which time a broad area of low pressure developed and convection began to consolidate around it . As a result , the disturbance was introduced into the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) ' s 48 @-@ hour Tropical Weather Outlook with a low chance of tropical development . These chances were subsequently raised as further development occurred , with the system receiving a medium chance of development early on October 10 , and a high chance of development as it approached the southern Leeward Islands late the following evening . As the wave crossed into the eastern Caribbean Sea and slowed down , the previously broad and open surface low consolidated and became stacked with the mid @-@ level center . The disturbance was already producing tropical storm @-@ force winds , and as a result , skipped tropical depression status to become Tropical Storm Rafael at 1800 UTC on October 12 . At this time , the cyclone was located roughly 200 mi ( 320 km ) south @-@ southeast of St. Croix . 
 Despite being named , Rafael remained disorganized initially ; this was the result of the interaction between an upper @-@ level trough and the cyclone itself . Moderate to strong wind shear dislocated the center of Rafael and the deepest shower and thunderstorm activity . Over the course of the next few days , however , the upper @-@ level trough gradually weakened and backed westward , allowing for the development of an anticyclone atop the tropical storm . Wind shear lessened , allowing the center to become obscured from view and outflow to develop in association with the system . As it began to execute a turn towards the north under the influence of an upper @-@ level trough to its west , a central dense overcast was noted on satellite imagery . Following a series of intensity estimates , Rafael was upgraded to a hurricane around 0600 UTC on October 15 , while positioned about 650 mi ( 1045 km ) south of Bermuda , although this intensity was speculated upon until later that afternoon following a hurricane hunters flight into the system . 
 As Rafael moved northward , it continued to intensify rapidly in spite of moderate wind shear . An eye became visible on microwave imagery during the morning hours of October 16 , during which time the cyclone attained its peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 969 mb ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 61 inHg ) . By the afternoon hours of that same day , data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicated that Rafael was on the verge of a weakening trend , attributed to decreasing sea surface temperatures and higher wind shear . Though the system retained hurricane @-@ force winds , it began to transition into an extratropical cyclone on October 17 , a process it completed by 1800 UTC that same day after interacting with a cold front ; at the time of the transition , Rafael was positioned well southwest of Nova Scotia . The remnants of the cyclone looped around a larger extratropical low over the north @-@ central Atlantic Ocean for several days prior to dissipating over Portugal by 1800 UTC on October 26 .

 Shortly after the development of Rafael , a tropical storm watch was issued for the island of Puerto Rico ; tropical storm warnings were issued for surrounding locations , including the British and U.S. Virgin Islands . By the morning hours of October 13 , the warnings were discontinued for Saint Lucia and Martinique , but issued for Culebra and Vieques . The warnings were discontinued for Guadeloupe and Saint Martin by the pre @-@ dawn hours of the following morning as Rafael pulled away , and expired for the remaining northeastern Caribbean Islands several hours later . In preparation for the system , the Virgin Islands Territorial Management <unk> ( <unk> ) activated several emergency operation centers across the region , and requested assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , who deployed a team of workers to cover the aftermath of Rafael . The departments of public works and power authority placed emergency crews on standby , while all ports out of the U.S. Virgin Islands were open to outbound vessel traffic only ; the Coast Guard advised mariners to prepare for impending severe weather . 
 As a tropical storm , Rafael hit Guadeloupe with large amounts of rain , causing significant damage to homes and especially crops . According to Météo @-@ France , up to 5 @.@ 9 inches ( 150 mm ) fell in 3 hours in the prefecture of Basse @-@ Terre , and up to 12 inches ( 300 mm ) in 48 hours between October 13 and 14 ; an estimated 7 @.@ 9 inches ( 200 mm ) fell during that same timeframe in Grande @-@ Terre . Flooding and mudslides as a result of the heavy rain damaged 60 to 80 % of the vegetable crops in Grande @-@ Terre , and lightning as a result of strong storms sparked fires and led to power outages . Sustained winds of 24 mph ( 39 km / h ) and gusts reaching 42 mph ( 68 km / h ) occurred in <unk> ; gusts reached 64 mph ( 103 km / h ) in La Désirade . A woman was killed in <unk> , part of Saint @-@ Claude , after attempting to drive her car across a flooded roadway ; she was swept away . Heavy rains in St. Kitts , amounting to 11 @.@ 87 in ( 301 mm ) in a 30 ‑ hour span , caused significant flooding and mudslides , especially around Basseterre . Traffic across the area was paralyzed as roads became impassable , and most businesses were closed for the duration of the storm . Many residents lost power and water supply as well . A few people attempted to drive through flooded roads and required rescue . Numerous weather stations in the French islands of Saint <unk> and Saint Martin recorded gusts of 63 mph ( 101 km / h ) and 67 mph ( 108 km / h ) , respectively . Although several boats were grounded , overall damage remained fairly minor in the French territories . Road 2 between <unk> , Puerto Rico and Vega Baja , Puerto Rico was flooded ; several houses were also flooded at Toa Alta High .

 As Rafael exited the northeastern Caribbean Sea , a tropical storm watch was issued for Bermuda on October 14 . This watch was subsequently upgraded to a tropical storm warning the following morning , but was dropped by early on October 17 as the system passed northeast of the island . In advance of the system , residents were urged to take their typical precautionary measures ; in addition , the main two airlines on Bermuda — WestJet and United Airlines — cancelled hundreds of flights on October 16 . Officials warned of minor storm surge along low @-@ lying coasts , while the Bermuda Weather Service ( BWS ) warned of two to four inches of rainfall . Winds , while stronger than locals expected , did not cause significant damage . The BWS noted that sustained winds of 34 mph ( 55 km / h ) , and gusts reaching 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) , occurred at the L.F. Wade International Airport as the storm made its closest approach ; these winds left about 600 houses without electricity according to the Bermuda Electric Light Company . Rainfall was less than originally feared , peaking at 1 @.@ 71 inches ( 43 mm ) . 
 = = = Newfoundland = = = 
 Though tropical cyclone watches and warnings were not issued , city officials in St. John 's recommended all residents in Newfoundland to prepare for Rafael . Large swells and storm surge produced by the post @-@ tropical cyclone caused extensive damage along the Avalon Peninsula . According to locals , the waves were more intense than during Hurricane Igor , a cyclone which devastated the region during the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season . Large sections of roads were washed out or covered in debris left behind by the waves . Near Trepassey , the local breakwater was destroyed in three sections , allowing waves to wash inland . As a result , a 9 @.@ 1 m ( 30 ft ) wide and 1 @.@ 5 m ( 5 ft ) deep gap in one of the main roads was left behind . In an area known as the Lower Coast , 50 people were cut off from the surrounding area . Overall damage in the area was estimated at C $ 1 – 2 million . Rainfall associated with the storm was light , amounting to 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) in Cape Race .
