 = Gabriel García Márquez = 
 Gabriel José de la Concordia García Márquez ( / <unk> <unk> / ; American Spanish : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; 6 March 1927 – 17 April 2014 ) was a Colombian novelist , short @-@ story writer , screenwriter and journalist , known affectionately as Gabo or <unk> throughout Latin America . Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century and one of the best in the Spanish language , he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature . He pursued a self @-@ directed education that resulted in his leaving law school for a career in journalism . From early on , he showed no inhibitions in his criticism of Colombian and foreign politics . In 1958 , he married Mercedes Barcha ; they had two sons , Rodrigo and Gonzalo . 
 García Márquez started as a journalist , and wrote many acclaimed non @-@ fiction works and short stories , but is best known for his novels , such as One Hundred Years of Solitude ( 1967 ) , The Autumn of the Patriarch ( 1975 ) , and Love in the Time of Cholera ( 1985 ) . His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success , most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magic realism , which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations . Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo ( the town mainly inspired by his birthplace Aracataca ) , and most of them explore the theme of solitude . 
 On his death in April 2014 , Juan Manuel Santos , the President of Colombia , described him as " the greatest Colombian who ever lived . " 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Gabriel García Márquez was born on 6 March 1927 in Aracataca , Colombia , to Gabriel Eligio García and Luisa <unk> Márquez Iguarán . Soon after García Márquez was born , his father became a pharmacist and moved , with his wife , to Barranquilla , leaving young <unk> in Aracataca . He was raised by his maternal grandparents , Doña <unk> Iguarán and Colonel Nicolás Ricardo Márquez Mejía . In December 1936 , his father took him and his brother to <unk> , while in March 1937 , his grandfather died ; the family then moved first ( back ) to Barranquilla and then on to Sucre , where his father started up a pharmacy . 
 When his parents fell in love , their relationship met with resistance from Luisa <unk> Márquez 's father , the Colonel . Gabriel Eligio García was not the man the Colonel had envisioned winning the heart of his daughter : he ( Gabriel Eligio ) was a Conservative , and had the reputation of being a womanizer . Gabriel Eligio wooed Luisa with violin serenades , love poems , countless letters , and even telephone messages after her father sent her away with the intention of separating the young couple . Her parents tried everything to get rid of the man , but he kept coming back , and it was obvious their daughter was committed to him . Her family finally capitulated and gave her permission to marry him ( The tragicomic story of their courtship would later be adapted and recast as Love in the Time of Cholera . ) 
 Since García Márquez 's parents were more or less strangers to him for the first few years of his life , his grandparents influenced his early development very strongly . His grandfather , whom he called " <unk> " , was a Liberal veteran of the Thousand Days War . The Colonel was considered a hero by Colombian Liberals and was highly respected . He was well known for his refusal to remain silent about the banana massacres that took place the year after García Márquez was born . The Colonel , whom García Márquez described as his " umbilical cord with history and reality , " was also an excellent storyteller . He taught García Márquez lessons from the dictionary , took him to the circus each year , and was the first to introduce his grandson to ice — a " miracle " found at the United Fruit Company store . He would also occasionally tell his young grandson " You can 't imagine how much a dead man weighs " , reminding him that there was no greater burden than to have killed a man , a lesson that García Márquez would later integrate into his novels . 
 García Márquez 's political and ideological views were shaped by his grandfather 's stories . In an interview , García Márquez told his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza , " my grandfather the Colonel was a Liberal . My political ideas probably came from him to begin with because , instead of telling me fairy tales when I was young , he would regale me with horrifying accounts of the last civil war that free @-@ thinkers and anti @-@ clerics waged against the Conservative government . " This influenced his political views and his literary technique so that " in the same way that his writing career initially took shape in conscious opposition to the Colombian literary status quo , García Márquez 's socialist and anti @-@ imperialist views are in principled opposition to the global status quo dominated by the United States . " 
 García Márquez 's grandmother , Doña <unk> Iguarán Cotes , played an equally influential role in his upbringing . He was inspired by the way she " treated the extraordinary as something perfectly natural . " The house was filled with stories of ghosts and premonitions , omens and portents , all of which were studiously ignored by her husband . According to García Márquez she was " the source of the magical , superstitious and supernatural view of reality " . He enjoyed his grandmother 's unique way of telling stories . No matter how fantastic or improbable her statements , she always delivered them as if they were the irrefutable truth . It was a deadpan style that , some thirty years later , heavily influenced her grandson 's most popular novel , One Hundred Years of Solitude . 
 = = = Journalism = = = 
 García Márquez began his career as a journalist while studying law at the National University of Colombia . In 1948 and 1949 he wrote for El Universal in Cartagena . Later , from 1950 until 1952 , he wrote a " whimsical " column under the name of " Septimus " for the local paper El Heraldo in Barranquilla . García Márquez noted of his time at El Heraldo , " I 'd write a piece and they 'd pay me three pesos for it , and maybe an editorial for another three . " During this time he became an active member of the informal group of writers and journalists known as the Barranquilla Group , an association that provided great motivation and inspiration for his literary career . He worked with inspirational figures such as Ramon <unk> , whom García Márquez depicted as an Old Catalan who owns a bookstore in One Hundred Years of Solitude . At this time , García Márquez was also introduced to the works of writers such as Virginia Woolf and William Faulkner . Faulkner 's narrative techniques , historical themes and use of rural locations influenced many Latin American authors . The environment of Barranquilla gave García Márquez a world @-@ class literary education and provided him with a unique perspective on Caribbean culture . From 1954 to 1955 , García Márquez spent time in Bogotá and regularly wrote for Bogotá 's El Espectador . He was a regular film critic which drove his interest in film . 
 In December 1957 García Márquez accepted a position in Caracas in the newspaper El Momento . He arrived to the Venezuelan capital on 23 December 1957 , and began working right away at El Momento . García Márquez also assisted in the 1958 Venezuelan coup d 'état , leading to the exile of the president Marcos Pérez Jiménez . Following this event , García Márquez wrote an article , " The participation of the clergy in the struggle " , describing the Church of Venezuela opposition against Jiménez 's regime . In March 1958 he made a trip to Colombia , where he married Mercedes Barcha and together they came back to Caracas . In May 1958 , disagreeing with the owner of Momento , he resigned and became shortly afterwards editor of the newspaper Venezuela <unk> . 
 = = = = The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor = = = = 
 Ending in controversy , his last domestically written editorial for El Espectador was a series of fourteen news articles in which he revealed the hidden story of how a Colombian Navy vessel 's shipwreck " occurred because the boat contained a badly stowed cargo of contraband goods that broke loose on the deck . " García Márquez compiled this story through interviews with a young sailor who survived the shipwreck . The publication of the articles resulted in public controversy , as they discredited the official account of the events , which had blamed a storm for the shipwreck , and glorified the surviving sailor . 
 In response to this controversy El Espectador sent García Márquez away to Europe to be a foreign correspondent . He wrote about his experiences for El Independiente , a newspaper which had briefly replaced El Espectador during the military government of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla and was later shut down by Colombian authorities . García Márquez 's background in journalism provided a foundational base for his writing career . Literary critic Bell @-@ <unk> noted , " Owing to his hands on experiences in journalism , García Márquez is , of all the great living authors , the one who is closest to everyday reality . " 
 = = = QAP = = = 
 García Márquez was one of the original founders of QAP , a newscast that aired between 1992 and 1997 . He was attracted to the project by the promise of editorial and journalistic independence . 
 = = = Marriage and family = = = 
 García Márquez met Mercedes Barcha while she was at school ; they decided to wait for her to finish before getting married . When he was sent to Europe as a foreign correspondent , Mercedes waited for him to return to Barranquilla . Finally they married in 1958 . The following year , their first son , Rodrigo García , now a television and film director , was born . In 1961 , the family traveled by Greyhound bus throughout the southern United States and eventually settled in Mexico City . García Márquez had always wanted to see the Southern United States because it inspired the writings of William Faulkner . Three years later the couple 's second son , Gonzalo , was born in Mexico . Gonzalo is currently a graphic designer in Mexico City . 
 = = = Leaf Storm = = = 
 Leaf Storm ( La <unk> ) is García Márquez 's first novella and took seven years to find a publisher , finally being published in 1955 . García Márquez notes that " of all that he had written ( as of 1973 ) , Leaf Storm was his favorite because he felt that it was the most sincere and spontaneous . " All the events of the novella take place in one room , during a half @-@ hour period on Wednesday 12 September 1928 . It is the story of an old colonel ( similar to García Márquez 's own grandfather ) who tries to give a proper Christian burial to an unpopular French doctor . The colonel is supported only by his daughter and grandson . The novella explores the child 's first experience with death by following his stream of consciousness . The book also reveals the perspective of Isabel , the Colonel 's daughter , which provides a feminine point of view . 
 = = = One Hundred Years of Solitude = = = 
 Since García Márquez was eighteen , he had wanted to write a novel based on his grandparents ' house where he grew up . However , he struggled with finding an appropriate tone and put off the idea until one day the answer hit him while driving his family to Acapulco . He turned the car around and the family returned home so he could begin writing . He sold his car so his family would have money to live on while he wrote , but writing the novel took far longer than he expected , and he wrote every day for eighteen months . His wife had to ask for food on credit from their butcher and their baker as well as nine months of rent on credit from their landlord . During the eighteen months of writing , García Márquez met with two couples , Eran Carmen and Álvaro Mutis , and María Luisa Elío and <unk> García Ascot , every night and discussed the progress of the novel , trying out different versions . Fortunately , when the book was finally published in 1967 it became his most commercially successful novel , One Hundred Years of Solitude , which sold more than 30 million copies ( Cien años de <unk> ) ( 1967 ; English translation by Gregory Rabassa 1970 ) and was dedicated “ Para ( to ) <unk> García Ascot y María Luisa Elío ” . The story chronicles several generations of the Buendía family from the time they founded the fictional South American village of Macondo , through their trials and tribulations , instances of incest , births and deaths . The history of Macondo is often generalized by critics to represent rural towns throughout Latin America or at least near García Márquez 's native Aracataca . 
 This novel was widely popular and led to García Márquez 's Nobel Prize as well as the Rómulo Gallegos Prize in 1972 . William Kennedy has called it " the first piece of literature since the Book of Genesis that should be required reading for the entire human race , " and hundreds of articles and books of literary critique have been published in response to it . Despite the many accolades the book received , García Márquez tended to downplay its success . He once remarked : " Most critics don 't realize that a novel like One Hundred Years of Solitude is a bit of a joke , full of signals to close friends ; and so , with some pre @-@ ordained right to pontificate they take on the responsibility of decoding the book and risk making terrible fools of themselves . " 
 = = = Fame = = = 
 After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez returned to Europe , this time bringing along his family , to live in Barcelona , Spain , for seven years . The international recognition García Márquez earned with the publication of the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas , including the former 19th of April Movement ( M @-@ 19 ) , and the current FARC and <unk> organizations . The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders , including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro , which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel : Portrait of a Friendship . It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature . In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature : “ Ours is an intellectual friendship . It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man . When we ’ re together , we talk a great deal about literature . ” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas , in his 1992 memoir Antes de que <unk> ( Before Night Falls ) . 
 Due to his newfound fame and his outspoken views on U.S. imperialism Garcia Márquez was labeled as a subversive and for many years was denied visas by U.S. immigration authorities . After Bill Clinton was elected U.S. president , he lifted the travel ban and cited One Hundred Years of Solitude as his favorite novel . 
 = = = Autumn of the Patriarch = = = 
 García Márquez was inspired to write a dictator novel when he witnessed the flight of Venezuelan dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez . He shares , " it was the first time we had seen a dictator fall in Latin America . " García Márquez began writing Autumn of the Patriarch ( El <unk> del <unk> ) in 1968 and said it was finished in 1971 ; however , he continued to embellish the dictator novel until 1975 when it was published in Spain . According to García Márquez , the novel is a " poem on the solitude of power " as it follows the life of an eternal dictator known as the General . The novel is developed through a series of anecdotes related to the life of the General , which do not appear in chronological order . Although the exact location of the story is not pin @-@ pointed in the novel , the imaginary country is situated somewhere in the Caribbean . 
 García Márquez gave his own explanation of the plot : 
 My intention was always to make a synthesis of all the Latin American dictators , but especially those from the Caribbean . Nevertheless , the personality of Juan Vicente Gomez [ of Venezuela ] was so strong , in addition to the fact that he exercised a special fascination over me , that undoubtedly the Patriarch has much more of him than anyone else . 
 After Autumn of the Patriarch was published García Márquez and his family moved from Barcelona to Mexico City and García Márquez pledged not to publish again until the Chilean Dictator Augusto Pinochet was deposed . However , he ultimately published Chronicle of a Death Foretold while Pinochet was still in power as he " could not remain silent in the face of injustice and repression . " 
 = = = Chronicle of a Death Foretold = = = 
 Chronicle of a Death Foretold ( Crónica de una muerte <unk> ) recreates a murder that took place in Sucre , Colombia in 1951 . The character named Santiago Nasar is based on a good friend from García Márquez 's childhood , Cayetano Gentile <unk> . Pelayo classifies this novel as a combination of journalism , realism and detective story . 
 The plot of the novel revolves around Santiago Nasar 's murder . The narrator acts as a detective , uncovering the events of the murder second by second . Literary critic Ruben Pelayo notes that the story " unfolds in an inverted fashion . Instead of moving forward ... the plot moves backwards . " In the first chapter , the narrator tells the reader exactly who killed Santiago Nasar and the rest of the book is left to unfold why . 
 Chronicle of a Death Foretold was published in 1981 , the year before García Márquez was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature . The novel was also adapted into a film by Italian director Francesco Rosi in 1987 . 
 = = = Love in the Time of Cholera = = = 
 Love in the Time of Cholera ( El amor en los <unk> del <unk> ) was first published in 1985 . It is considered a non @-@ traditional love story as " lovers find love in their ' golden years ' — in their seventies , when death is all around them " . 
 Love in the Time of Cholera is based on the stories of two couples . The young love of <unk> <unk> and Florentino Ariza is based on the love affair of García Márquez 's parents . However , as García Márquez explains in an interview : “ The only difference is [ my parents ] married . And as soon as they were married , they were no longer interesting as literary figures . " The love of old people is based on a newspaper story about the death of two Americans , who were almost 80 years old , who met every year in Acapulco . They were out in a boat one day and were murdered by the boatman with his oars . García Márquez notes , " Through their death , the story of their secret romance became known . I was fascinated by them . They were each married to other people . " 
 = = = News of a Kidnapping = = = 
 News of a Kidnapping ( <unk> de un <unk> ) was first published in 1996 . It is a non @-@ fiction book that examines a series of related kidnappings and <unk> @-@ terrorist actions committed in the early 1990s in Colombia by the Medellín Cartel , a drug cartel founded and operated by Pablo Escobar . The text recounts the kidnapping , imprisonment , and eventual release of prominent figures in Colombia , including politicians and members of the press . The original idea of the book was proposed to García Márquez by the former minister for education <unk> <unk> Castro and Colombian diplomat Luis Alberto <unk> Cárdenas , both of whom were among the many victims of a Pablo Escobar 's attempt to pressure the government to stop his extradition by committing a series of kidnappings , murders and terrorist actions . 
 = = = Living to Tell the Tale and Memories of My Melancholy Whores = = = 
 In 2002 , García Márquez published the memoir Vivir para <unk> , the first of a projected three @-@ volume autobiography . Edith Grossman 's English translation , Living to Tell the Tale , was published in November 2003 . October 2004 brought the publication of a novel , Memories of My Melancholy Whores ( Memoria de mis <unk> <unk> ) , a love story that follows the romance of a 90 @-@ year @-@ old man and a pubescent concubine . Memories of My Melancholy Whores caused controversy in Iran , where it was banned after an initial 5 @,@ 000 copies were printed and sold . 
 = = = Film and opera = = = 
 Critics often describe the language that García Márquez 's imagination produces as visual or graphic , and he himself explains each of his stories is inspired by " a visual image , " so it comes as no surprise that he had a long and involved history with film . He was a film critic , he founded and served as executive director of the Film Institute in Havana , was the head of the Latin American Film Foundation , and wrote several screenplays . For his first script he worked with Carlos Fuentes on Juan Rulfo 's El <unk> de oro . His other screenplays include the films Tiempo de <unk> ( 1966 ) , ( 1985 ) and Un <unk> <unk> viejo con <unk> alas <unk> ( 1988 ) , as well as the television series Amores <unk> ( 1991 ) . 
 García Márquez also originally wrote his <unk> as a third screenplay . However , this version was lost and replaced by the novella . Nonetheless , he worked on rewriting the script in collaboration with Ruy Guerra and the film was released in Mexico in 1983 . 
 Several of his stories have inspired other writers and directors . In 1987 , the Italian director Francesco Rosi directed the movie <unk> di una morte <unk> based on Chronicle of a Death Foretold . Several film adaptations have been made in Mexico , including Miguel <unk> 's La <unk> de Montiel ( 1979 ) , Jaime Humberto Hermosillo 's Maria de mi corazón ( 1979 ) , and Arturo <unk> 's El <unk> no tiene <unk> le <unk> ( 1998 ) . 
 British director Mike Newell ( Four Weddings and a Funeral ) filmed Love in the Time of Cholera in Cartagena , Colombia , with the screenplay written by Ronald Harwood ( The Pianist ) . The film was released in the U.S. on 16 November 2007 . 
 His novel Of Love and Other Demons was adapted and directed by a Costa Rican filmmaker , Hilda Hidalgo , who is a graduate of the Film Institute at Havana where García Márquez would frequently impart screenplay workshops . Hidalgo 's film was released in April 2010 . The same novel was adapted by Hungarian composer Péter Eötvös to form the opera Love and Other Demons , premiered in 2008 at Glyndebourne Festival .

 = = = = Declining health = = = = 
 In 1999 , García Márquez was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer . Chemotherapy provided by a hospital in Los Angeles proved to be successful , and the illness went into remission . This event prompted García Márquez to begin writing his memoirs : " I reduced relations with my friends to a minimum , disconnected the telephone , canceled the trips and all sorts of current and future plans " , he told El Tiempo , the Colombian newspaper , " ... and locked myself in to write every day without interruption . " In 2002 , three years later , he published Living to Tell the Tale ( Vivir para <unk> ) , the first volume in a projected trilogy of memoirs . 
 In 2000 , his impending death was incorrectly reported by Peruvian daily newspaper La República . The next day other newspapers republished his alleged farewell poem , " La <unk> , " but shortly afterwards García Márquez denied being the author of the poem , which was determined to be the work of a Mexican ventriloquist . 
 He stated that 2005 " was the first [ year ] in my life in which I haven 't written even a line . With my experience , I could write a new novel without any problems , but people would realise my heart wasn 't in it . " 
 In May 2008 , it was announced that García Márquez was finishing a new " novel of love " that had yet to be given a title , to be published by the end of the year . However , in April 2009 his agent , Carmen <unk> , told the Chilean newspaper La Tercera that García Márquez was unlikely to write again . This was disputed by Random House Mondadori editor Cristobal Pera , who stated that García Márquez was completing a new novel called We 'll Meet in August ( En agosto nos <unk> ) . 
 In December 2008 , García Márquez told fans at the Guadalajara book fair that writing had worn him out . In 2009 , responding to claims by both his literary agent and his biographer that his writing career was over , he told Colombian newspaper El Tiempo : " Not only is it not true , but the only thing I do is write " . 
 In 2012 , his brother Jaime announced that García Márquez was suffering from dementia . 
 In April 2014 , García Márquez was hospitalized in Mexico . He had infections in his lungs and his urinary tract , and was suffering from dehydration . He was responding well to antibiotics . Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto wrote on Twitter , " I wish him a speedy recovery " . Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos said his country was thinking of the author and said in a tweet " All of Colombia wishes a speedy recovery to the greatest of all time : Gabriel García Márquez " . 
 = = = = Death and funeral = = = = 
 García Márquez died of pneumonia at the age of 87 on 17 April 2014 in Mexico City . His death was confirmed by his relative Fernanda Familiar on Twitter , and by his former editor Cristóbal Pera . 
 The Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos mentioned : " One Hundred Years of Solitude and sadness for the death of the greatest Colombian of all time " . The former Colombian president Álvaro Uribe Vélez said : " Master García Márquez , thanks forever , millions of people in the planet fell in love with our nation fascinated with your lines " . At the time of his death , he had a wife and two sons . 
 Garcia Marquez was cremated at a private family ceremony in Mexico City . On 22 April , the presidents of Colombia and Mexico attended a formal ceremony in Mexico City , where Garcia Marquez had lived for more than three decades . A funeral cortege took the urn containing his ashes from his house to the Palacio de Bellas Artes , where the memorial ceremony was held . Earlier , residents in his home town of Aracataca in Colombia 's Caribbean region held a symbolic funeral . 
 = = Style = = 
 While there are certain aspects readers can almost always expect in García Márquez 's writing , like instances of humour , he did not stick to any clear and predetermined style template . In an interview with <unk> Simons , García Márquez noted : 
 In every book I try to make a different path [ ... ] . One doesn 't choose the style . You can investigate and try to discover what the best style would be for a theme . But the style is determined by the subject , by the mood of the times . If you try to use something that is not suitable , it just won 't work . Then the critics build theories around that and they see things I hadn 't seen . I only respond to our way of life , the life of the Caribbean . 
 García Márquez was also noted for leaving out seemingly important details and events so the reader is forced into a more participatory role in the story development . For example , in No One Writes to the Colonel , the main characters are not given names . This practice is influenced by Greek tragedies , such as Antigone and Oedipus Rex , in which important events occur off @-@ stage and are left to the audience 's imagination . 
 = = = Realism and magical realism = = = 
 Reality is an important theme in all of García Márquez 's works . He said of his early works ( with the exception of Leaf Storm ) , " Nobody Writes to the Colonel , In Evil Hour , and Big Mama 's Funeral all reflect the reality of life in Colombia and this theme determines the rational structure of the books . I don 't regret having written them , but they belong to a kind of premeditated literature that offers too static and exclusive a vision of reality . " 
 In his other works he experimented more with less traditional approaches to reality , so that " the most frightful , the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression " . A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude . The style of these works fits in the " marvellous realm " described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism . Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez 's style , as the category magic realism is criticized for being <unk> and <unk> , " what is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has , by its own inner logic , necessarily marginalised or repressed . " García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way , 
 " The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism . I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it ... . " " This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn 't limited to the price of tomatoes and eggs . " 
 = = Motifs = = 
 = = = Solitude = = = 
 The theme of solitude runs through much of García Márquez 's works . As Pelayo notes , " Love in the Time of Cholera , like all of Gabriel García Márquez 's work , explores the solitude of the individual and of humankind ... portrayed through the solitude of love and of being in love " . 
 In response to Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza 's question , " If solitude is the theme of all your books , where should we look for the roots of this over @-@ riding emotion ? In your childhood perhaps ? " García Márquez replied , " I think it 's a problem everybody has . Everyone has his own way and means of expressing it . The feeling pervades the work of so many writers , although some of them may express it unconsciously . " 
 In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech , Solitude of Latin America , he relates this theme of solitude to the Latin American experience , " The interpretation of our reality through patterns not our own , serves only to make us ever more unknown , ever less free , ever more solitary . " 
 = = = Macondo = = = 
 Another important theme in many of García Márquez 's work is the setting of the village he calls Macondo . He uses his home town of Aracataca , Colombia as a cultural , historical and geographical reference to create this imaginary town , but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area . García Márquez shares , " Macondo is not so much a place as a state of mind , which allows you to see what you want , and how you want to see it . " Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo , there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location . So while they are often set with " a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland ... [ the settings are ] otherwise unspecified , in accordance with García Márquez 's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis . " This fictional town has become well known in the literary world . As Stavans notes of Macondo , " its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers , politicians , and tourist agents ... " makes it " ... hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication . " In Leaf Storm García Márquez depicts the realities of the Banana Boom in Macondo , which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies . As well , One Hundred Years of Solitude takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom . 
 In his autobiography , García Márquez explains his fascination with the word and concept Macondo . He describes a trip he made with his mother back to Aracataca as a young man : 
 The train stopped at a station that had no town , and a short while later it passed the only banana plantation along the route that had its name written over the gate : Macondo . This word had attracted my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather , but I discovered only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance . I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant ... I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the Ceiba . 
 = = = Violence = = = 
 In several of García Márquez 's works , including No One Writes to the Colonel , In Evil Hour , and Leaf Storm , he referenced La <unk> ( the violence ) , " a brutal civil war between conservatives and liberals that lasted into the 1960s , causing the deaths of several hundred thousand Colombians " . Throughout all of his novels there are subtle references to la violencia . For example , characters live under various unjust situations like curfew , press censorship , and underground newspapers . In Evil Hour , while not one of García Márquez 's most famous novels , is notable for its portrayal of la violencia with its " fragmented portrayal of social disintegration provoked by la violencia " . Although García Márquez did portray the corrupt nature and the injustices of times like la violencia , he refused to use his work as a platform for political propaganda . " For him , the duty of the revolutionary writer is to write well , and the ideal novel is one that moves its reader by its political and social content , and , at the same time , by its power to penetrate reality and expose its other side . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Whether in fiction or nonfiction , in the epic novel or the concentrated story , Márquez is now recognized in the words of Carlos Fuentes as " the most popular and perhaps the best writer in Spanish since Cervantes " . He is one of those very rare artists who succeed in chronicling not only a nation 's life , culture and history , but also those of an entire continent , and a master storyteller who , as The New York Review of Books once said , " forces upon us at every page the wonder and extravagance of life . " 
 García Márquez 's work is an important part of the Latin American Boom of literature . His work has challenged critics of Colombian literature to step out of the conservative criticism that had been dominant before the success of One Hundred Years of Solitude . In a review of literary criticism Robert Sims notes , 
 García Márquez continues to cast a lengthy shadow in Colombia , Latin America , and the United States . Critical works on the 1982 Nobel laureate have reached industrial proportion and show no signs of abating . Moreover , García Márquez has galvanized Colombian literature in an unprecedented way by giving a tremendous impetus to Colombian literature . Indeed , he has become a touchstone for literature and criticism throughout the Americas as his work has created a certain attraction @-@ repulsion among critics and writers while readers continue to devour new publications . No one can deny that García Márquez has helped rejuvenate , reformulate , and recontextualize literature and criticism in Colombia and the rest of Latin America . 
 = = = Nobel Prize = = = 
 García Márquez received the Nobel Prize in Literature on 8 December 1982 " for his novels and short stories , in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination , reflecting a continent 's life and conflicts " . His acceptance speech was entitled " The Solitude of Latin America " . García Márquez was the first Colombian and fourth Latin American to win a Nobel Prize for Literature . After becoming a Nobel laureate , García Márquez stated to a correspondent : " I have the impression that in giving me the prize , they have taken into account the literature of the sub @-@ continent and have awarded me as a way of awarding all of this literature " .

 = Lola ( song ) = 
 " Lola " is a song written by Ray Davies and performed by English rock band the Kinks on their album Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround , Part One . The song details a romantic encounter between a young man and a possible transvestite , whom he meets in a club in Soho , London . In the song , the narrator describes his confusion towards a person named Lola who " walked like a woman and talked like a man " . Although Ray Davies claims that the incident was inspired by a true encounter experienced by the band 's manager , alternate explanations for the song have been given by drummer Mick Avory . 
 The song was released in the United Kingdom on 12 June 1970 , while in the United States it was released on 28 June 1970 . Commercially , the single reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 . Due to its controversial subject matter and use of the brand name Coca @-@ Cola , the single received backlash and even bans in Britain and Australia . The British version of the song uses the phrase " cherry cola " while the US version uses the name " Coca @-@ Cola . " The track has since become one of The Kinks ' most iconic and popular songs , later being ranked number 422 on " Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " as well as number 473 on the " NME 's 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time " list . 
 Since its release , " Lola " has appeared on multiple compilation and live albums . In 1980 , a live version of the song from the album One for the Road was released as a single in America and some European countries , becoming a minor hit . Other versions include live renditions from 1972 's Everybody 's in Show @-@ Biz and 1996 's To the Bone . The " Lola " character also made an appearance in the lyrics of the band 's 1981 song , " Destroyer " . 
 = = Background = = 
 Ray Davies has claimed that he was inspired to write " Lola " after Kinks manager Robert Wace spent a night in Paris dancing with a transgender woman . Davies said of the incident , " In his apartment , Robert had been dancing with this black woman , and he said , ' I 'm really onto a thing here . ' And it was okay until we left at six in the morning and then I said , ' Have you seen the stubble ? ' He said ' Yeah , ' but he was too pissed [ intoxicated ] to care , I think . " 
 Drummer Mick Avory has offered an alternate explanation for the song 's lyrics , claiming that " Lola " was partially inspired by Avory 's frequenting of transgender bars in west London . Avory said , " We used to know this character called Michael McGrath . He used to hound the group a bit , because being called The Kinks did attract these sorts of people . He used to come down to Top of the Pops , and he was publicist for John Stephen 's shop in Carnaby Street . He used to have this place in Earl 's Court , and he used to invite me to all these drag queen acts and transsexual pubs . They were like secret clubs . And that 's where Ray [ Davies ] got the idea for ' Lola . ' When he was invited too , he wrote it while I was getting drunk . " 
 Despite claims that the song was written about a supposed date between Ray Davies and trans woman actress Candy Darling , Davies has since claimed this rumour to be false , saying that the two only went out to dinner together and that he had known the whole time of Darling 's gender identity . 
 In his autobiography , Dave Davies said that he came up with the music for what would become " Lola " , noting that brother Ray added the lyrics after hearing it . In a 1990 interview , Dave Davies claimed that " Lola " was written in a similar fashion to ' You Really Got Me ' in that the two worked on Ray 's basic skeleton of the song , saying that the song was more of a collaborative effort than many believed . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 Written in April 1970 , " Lola " was cited by Ray Davies as the first song he wrote following a break he took to act in the 1970 Play for Today film The Long Distance Piano Player . Davies said that he had initially struggled with writing an opening that would sell the song , but the rest of the song " came naturally . " 
 Initial recordings of the song began in April 1970 , but , as the band 's bassist John Dalton remembered , recording for " Lola " took particularly long , stretching into the next month . During April , four to five versions were attempted , utilizing different keys as well as varying beginnings and styles . In May , new piano parts were added to the backing track by John Gosling , the band 's new piano player that had just been auditioned . Vocals were also added at this time . The song was then mixed during that month . Mick Avory remembered the recording sessions for the song positively , saying that it " was fun , as it was the Baptist 's [ John Gosling 's ] first recording with us . " 
 The guitar opening on the song was produced as a result of combining the sound of a Martin guitar and a vintage Dobro resonating guitar . Ray Davies cited this blend of guitar sounds for the song 's unique guitar sound . 
 = = Release and controversy = = 
 Despite the chart success " Lola " would achieve , its fellow Lola vs. Powerman track " Powerman " was initially considered to be the first single from the album . However , " Lola " , which Ray Davies later claimed was an attempt to write a hit , was eventually decided on as the debut single release . 
 " Lola " was released as a single in 1970 . In the UK , the B @-@ side to the single was the Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society outtake " Berkeley Mews " while the Dave Davies @-@ penned " Mindless Child of Motherhood " was used in the US . It became an unexpected chart smash for the Kinks , reaching number two in Britain and number nine in the United States . The single also saw success worldwide , reaching the top of the charts in Ireland , New Zealand , and South Africa , as well as the top 5 in Germany , Austria , Belgium , and Switzerland . The success of the single had important ramifications for the band 's career at a critical time , allowing them to negotiate a new contract with RCA Records , construct their own London Studio , and assume more creative and managerial control . In a 1970 interview , Dave Davies claimed that , if " Lola " had been a failure , the band would have " gone on making records for another year or so and then drifted apart . " 
 Although the track was a major hit for the band , Dave Davies did not enjoy the success of " Lola " , saying , " In fact , when ' Lola ' was a hit , it made me feel a bit uncomfortable . Because it was taking us out of a different sort of comfort zone , where we 'd been getting into the work , and the writing and the musicality was more thought about . It did have that smell of : ' Oh blimey , not that again . ' I found it a bit odd , that period . And then it got odder and weirder . " Mick Avory said that he " enjoyed the success " the band had with " Lola " and its follow @-@ up , " Apeman . " 
 = = = Censorship = = = 
 Originally , " Lola " received backlash for its controversial lyrics . Talks of censorship began to arise , with some radio stations fading the track out before Lola 's biological sex was revealed . On 18 November 1970 , the song was even banned in Australia because of " controversial subject matter . " In a then @-@ current Record Mirror article entitled " Sex Change Record : Kink Speaks " , Ray Davies refused to tell Lola 's biological sex , saying , " It really doesn 't matter what sex Lola is , I think she 's alright . " 
 Despite its subject matter , the BBC banned the track for a different reason . The original song recorded in stereo had the word " Coca @-@ Cola " in the lyrics , but because of BBC Radio 's policy against product placement , Ray Davies was forced to make a round @-@ trip flight from New York to London and back — interrupting the band 's American tour — to change those words to the generic " cherry cola " for the single release . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 " Lola " received positive reviews from critics . Upon the single 's release , the NME praised the song as " an engaging and sparkling piece with a gay Latin flavour and a catchy hook chorus . " Billboard said of the song at the time of its US release , " Currently a top ten British chart winner , this infectious rhythm item has all the ingredients to put the Kinks right back up the Hot 100 here with solid impact . " Rolling Stone critic Paul Gambaccini called the song as " brilliant and a smash . " Music critic Robert Christgau , despite his mixed opinion on the Lola vs. Powerman album , praised the single as " astounding . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic lauded the song for " its crisp , muscular sound , pitched halfway between acoustic folk and hard rock . " Ultimate Classic Rock ranked " Lola " as The Kinks ' third best song , saying " the great guitar riff that feeds the song is one of Dave 's all @-@ time greatest . " Paste Magazine listed the track as the band 's fourth best song . 
 The song was also well @-@ liked by the band . Mick Avory , who noted the song as one of the songs he was most proud to be associated with , said " I always liked ' Lola ' , I liked the subject . It 's not like anything else . I liked it for that . We 'd always take a different path . " In a 1983 interview , Ray Davies said , " I 'm just very pleased I recorded it and more pleased I wrote it . " The band revisited the " Lola " character in the lyrics of their 1981 song , " Destroyer " , a minor chart hit in America . 
 Satirical artist " Weird Al " Yankovic created a parody of the song called " Yoda " , featuring lyrics about the Star Wars character of the same name , on his 1985 album Dare to Be Stupid .

 Since its release , " Lola " became a mainstay in The Kinks ' live repertoire , appearing in the majority of the band 's subsequent set @-@ lists until the group 's break @-@ up . In 1972 , a live performance of the song recorded at Carnegie Hall in New York City appeared on the live half of the band 's 1972 album , Everybody 's in Show @-@ Biz , a double @-@ LP which contained half new studio compositions and half live versions of previously released songs . 
 A live version of " Lola " , recorded on 23 September 1979 in Providence , Rhode Island , was released as a single in the US in July 1980 to promote the live album One for the Road . The B @-@ side was the live version of " Celluloid Heroes " . The single was a moderate success , reaching number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100 . It was also released in some countries in Europe ( although not the UK ) in April 1981 . It topped the charts in both the Netherlands , matching the number one peak of the original version , and in Belgium , where it exceeded the original 's peak of three . It also charted in Australia , peaking at number 69 and spending 22 weeks on the charts . Although not released as a stand @-@ alone single in the UK , it was included on a bonus single ( backed with a live version of " David Watts " from the same album ) with initial copies of " Better Things " in June 1981 .

 = South Forty @-@ Foot Drain = 
 The South Forty @-@ Foot Drain , also known as the Black Sluice Navigation , is the main channel for the land @-@ drainage of the Black Sluice Level in the Lincolnshire Fens . It lies in eastern England between Guthram Gowt and the Black Sluice pumping station on The Haven , at Boston . The Drain has its origins in the 1630s , when the first scheme to make the Fen land available for agriculture was carried out by the Earl of Lindsey , and has been steadily improved since then . Water drained from the land entered The Haven by gravity at certain states of the tide until 1946 , when the Black Sluice pumping station was commissioned . 
 The Drain was navigable until 1971 , when improvements to the pumping station led to the entrance lock being removed . It is currently being upgraded to navigable status by the Environment Agency , as part of the Fens Waterways Link , with a new entrance lock being completed in December 2008 , giving access to the first 12 miles ( 19 km ) of the drain , and the upgrading of the southern section , including a link to the River Glen to allow navigation to Spalding forming phase 2 of the project . 
 = = History = = 
 The Lincolnshire Fens are an area of low @-@ lying land which have been subject to flooding and attempts to prevent it for centuries . In medieval times , the <unk> Dyke was built to drain the area , but by 1500 , this was regarded less as a drain for the land than as a boundary marker between the Parts of Holland and the Parts of Kesteven , two of the three medieval subdivisions of Lincolnshire which functioned as county councils until their abolition in 1974 . The first serious attempt to drain the area to the south west of Boston , now known as the Black Sluice Area but formerly known as the Lindsey Level , was from 1635 to 1638 , when the Earl of Lindsey agreed with the Commissioners of Sewers for Lincolnshire to carry out drainage works which would make 36 @,@ 000 acres ( 150 km2 ) of land available for agricultural use . The Earl and a group of Adventurers paid for the works , in return for land grants . 
 The cost of the work was £ 45 @,@ 000 , and involved the construction of a sluice near Boston , called Skirbeck Sluice , the construction of the first 8 miles ( 13 km ) of the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain , from Boston to Great Hale , the construction of two drains from there to Guthram , which were called the Double <unk> , and the construction of the Clay Dyke Drain .. The scheme was not popular with the local <unk> , who made a living from fishing and wildfowling , or with the Commoners , who had a right to graze animals on the common land when it was not flooded . They attempted to get Parliament to rule in their favour , but after three years of trying , they abandoned the idea of legal redress , and took direct action . They destroyed much of the work , as well as buildings and crops , and burnt Skirbeck Sluice . The Earl of Lindsey 's contract with the Commissioners of Sewers was revoked by parliament , and it was another hundred years before the next attempt to drain the area . 
 In an attempt to drain Holland Fen , and prevent flooding from the River Witham , an adventurer called Earl Fitzwilliam constructed a drain in 1720 , which runs broadly parallel to the River Witham , and terminated at <unk> 's Gowt , a sluice which he constructed on the Witham close to the location of the present Grand Sluice . The drain was for many years called Earl Fitzwilliam 's drain , but is now called the North Forty @-@ Foot Drain . The scheme was not entirely successful . 
 = = = Second Sluice = = = 
 In 1762 , the Witham Drainage Act was passed by Parliament , and among other things constituted the Commissioners of Sewers for the Second and Sixth District , which covered the area including <unk> , Ewerby , Great Hale , Heckington , Holland Fen , Howell , Little Hale and South Kyme . Much of the area to the south and west of Boston , some 91 square miles ( 240 km2 ) , was inundated by the Great Flood of 1763 , and against this background , the Black Sluice Drainage and Navigation Act 1765 was obtained which created the Black Sluice Commissioners , giving them power to raise taxes and authority to carry out drainage works . The scheme largely revived the Earl of Lindsey 's original scheme . The initial design work was carried out by the civil engineer Langley Edwards , on loan from the Witham Commissioners . Some of the surveying was performed by John Landen , who was the steward of the estate of Earl Fitzwilliam at Peterborough , and a proficient amateur mathematician . The two men were jointly appointed Surveyors of the Works , acting as engineers for the scheme , while John Chapman and Richard <unk> were assistants . A new sluice , called the Black Sluice , was built at Boston as a direct replacement for the Skirbeck Sluice , having three openings with a total width of 40 feet ( 12 m ) . The 8 miles ( 13 km ) of the drain were scoured from Boston to Great Hale , beyond which the Main Drain was upgraded by cutting a new 14 @-@ mile ( 23 km ) channel , effectively extending the South Forth @-@ Foot Drain to Guthram , on the banks of the River Glen . A total of 65 miles ( 105 km ) of highland streams were improved by scouring and raising of the banks . The estimated cost of £ 16 @,@ 000 was raised by issuing bonds , but the project overran , and another Act of Parliament was obtained in 1770 to authorise the raising of the drainage taxes , to cover the difference . By mid @-@ 1769 , when Landen and Edwards left the project , because the work was largely complete , the scheme had cost £ 24 @,@ 000 . They were replaced by Edward Hare as Surveyor of Works , with Chapman and <unk> continuing as assistants . A historian called W. H. Wheeler , who chronicled the Lincolnshire fens , wrote that " the works were efficiently carried out and , being well @-@ designed , entirely answered expectation . " 
 On the River Witham , the Grand Sluice was constructed and opened on 15 October 1766 , and this prevented tidal water from entering the river , and hence flooding the Holland Fen . The Boston Harbour Commissioners were created by the Boston Port Act 1766 , and they carried out improvement works to The Haven , which resulted in lower water levels at the Black Sluice , and hence more efficient draining from the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain . Water was pumped into the drain by a series of windmills driving scoop wheels . Maps of the area produced in 1783 by Edward Hare show 46 such mills , which provided drainage for 32 @,@ 000 acres ( 130 km2 ) of agricultural land . Extreme high tides in 1810 and again in 1820 resulted in widespread flooding , and further thought was given to improving the flood defences . 
 With the improvements to the River Witham , the final section of Earl Fitzwilliam 's drain to <unk> Gowt was filled in , and the channel was diverted to join the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain . Renamed the North Forty @-@ Foot Drain , it now supplies Cook 's Lock and Holland Fen pumping stations . 
 = = = Third Sluice = = = 
 Reports on improvements to the system were produced in 1843 by the surveyor Mr W Lewin and in 1845 by Sir John Rennie . Rennie 's scheme involved the provision of a catchwater drain to collect water draining from the higher ground to the west before it entered the <unk> , but an Act of Parliament to authorise its construction was defeated , and so in 1846 a report by Mr W Cubit which proposed improvements to the existing infrastructure was accepted by the Commissioners . A new Black Sluice , including a 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide navigation lock , was constructed to the south of the original one , with the cill level 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) lower , which enabled the gradient of the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain to be increased to 3 inches per mile ( 5 cm / km ) . Many of the tributary drains were also improved . 1846 also marked the beginning of the use of steam engines for pumping . Ten years later , a map covering 18 @,@ 000 acres ( 73 km2 ) of the Black Sluice area showed nine steam @-@ powered and eight wind @-@ powered drainage engines in use . 
 The River Witham Outfall Improvement Act 1880 authorised further improvements to the mouth of the Witham , to which the Black Sluice Commissioners contributed £ 65 @,@ 000 . This work led to a further drop of 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) in the low water level at the Black Sluice . Oil and paraffin engines began to replace steam and wind engines from 1910 , and by 1935 there were 15 such engines pumping water into the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain . The passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930 resulted in the Commissioners being replaced by the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board , while responsibility for the rivers in the area passed to the Witham and <unk> Rivers Catchment Board . With war imminent , the Rivers Board took over the Black Sluice and the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain in 1939 , and although progress was interrupted by the Second World War , a £ 374 @,@ 000 scheme to construct the Black Sluice pumping station and to widen 11 miles ( 18 km ) of the drain from Boston to Donington Bridge was completed in 1946 . The pumping station contained three 100 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 5 m ) pumps , each powered by a 900 @-@ horsepower ( 670 kW ) 5 @-@ cylinder vertical diesel engine manufactured by Ruston . 
 = = = Modern era = = = 
 <unk> and oil engines gave way to electrically powered pumping stations in the 1950s , with the Board constructing six electric and one diesel pumping station to improve drainage to an extra 11 @,@ 000 acres ( 45 km2 ) of land . In 1960 , the decision was taken to further improve drainage of an area of 70 @,@ 000 acres ( 280 km2 ) , as part of a £ 1 @.@ 4 million scheme which included the addition of two extra pumps at the Black Sluice , replacement of existing pumps elsewhere , and the widening of 7 miles ( 11 km ) of the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain from Donington Bridge to <unk> Running Dyke . Jurisdiction for the Drain and the sluice passed to the Lincolnshire River Board at this time . The work , which began in 1962 and was completed in 1968 , proved successful in preventing flooding during severe wet weather in the winter of 1968 / 9 . With three 900 @-@ horsepower ( 670 kW ) and two 925 @-@ horsepower ( 690 kW ) diesel engines , the upgraded pumping station can pump 800 thousand gallons per minute ( 60 m3 / s ) . Responsibility for the drain and the sluice passed to the National Rivers Authority in 1990 , and to the Environment Agency in 1995 . 
 Despite all the improvements , serious flooding occurred in 1999 when the bank of the drain was breached near Pinchbeck . Staff from the Environment Agency and the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board successfully repaired the breach before properties were flooded , and a review of the flood defences was then carried out . The report recommended improvements to some of the banks , but funding for the work was not available , and so no work was done at the time .

 The South Forty @-@ Foot Drain serves as a district boundary over the length where it runs roughly south to north . South of Donington High Bridge , the Drain separates South Kesteven to the west from South Holland to the east . The boundary then continues southwards along the River Glen . North of Donington , the boundary between the borough of Boston to the east and North Kesteven to the west follows the line of the Drain . As the Drain crosses the line of the <unk> Dyke , just before the Nottingham to Boston railway joins it at Great Hale pumping station , the boundary turns northwards , following its medieval course . 
 The main job of the Drain is to gather the waters pumped from the Kesteven Fens , the Holland Fens and the Weir Dyke , a soak dike in Bourne North Fen , alongside the Bourne Eau and River Glen , northwards and eastwards to the Black Sluice at Boston , where they are discharged to the tidal waters of The Haven . The Weir Dyke takes its name from a weir in the bank of the Bourne Eau at Tongue End , which was constructed by the Black Sluice Commissioners , to allow water from the Bourne Eau to overflow the bank when excess water could not flow into the River Glen in times of flood . The <unk> weir became redundant when the Tongue End pumping station was constructed in 1966 . 
 The South Forty @-@ Foot Drain and the Black Sluice pumping station , together with most of the side channels which run into the drain are the responsibility of the Environment Agency . Management of the drainage ditches which drain the Fens are the responsibility of the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board , who maintain 34 pumping stations and three gravity stations in the region . Of these , 21 are situated on the banks of the Drain , and pump directly into it , while one , the Black Hole Drove pumping station , is constructed over the channel , and acts as a boundary between the part of the Drain managed by the Environment Agency , and that managed by the Drainage Board . 
 = = Navigation = = 
 Prior to 1971 , the Drain had been navigable , but this privilege was removed at that time . It is unclear whether there was ever a right of navigation , or whether the Black Sluice Commissioners simply allowed it . The entrance lock was 72 by 20 feet ( 21 @.@ 9 by 6 @.@ 1 m ) , and most trade was between Boston and Donnington Bridge , with pleasure boating not being allowed prior to 1962 . The lock was closed and removed in 1971 , with little protest being made . More recently , the East Anglian Waterways Association promoted the idea that the Drain could again be made navigable as part of a larger scheme to improve leisure facilities . The local authorities which were part of the Fens Tourism consortium conducted a feasibility study , and this report was formally adopted as the Fens Waterways Link by the Environment Agency in 2004 , with the support of the local authorities , the East Anglian Waterways Association and the Inland Waterways Association . 
 The scheme involved a total of 150 miles ( 240 km ) of waterway , of which 50 miles ( 80 km ) would be new <unk> , while the rest would be existing waterways which could be upgraded or have their access improved . When completed , it would connect the Rivers Witham , Glen , Welland , Nene and Great Ouse , and was heralded as the biggest waterway enhancement project in Europe by the Environment Agency . In 2007 they obtained funding for the link between Boston and Spalding . Work on a new lock beside the Black Sluice pumping station at Boston - to connect The Haven and the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain - was formally started on 8 February 2008 , and was completed in December 2008 , with the official opening ceremony being held on 20 March 2009 . The lock project formed phase 1 of the scheme , and the cost of £ 8 @.@ 5 million was jointly funded by the European Regional Development Fund , the East Midlands Development Agency , and Lincolnshire County Council . The lock is designed to be used for a period either side of high tide , and so there is a rise from the Drain to the Haven . It has conventional mitre gates at one end , but uses rotating sector gates at the tidal end , each one weighing 12 @.@ 1 tonnes . 
 The lock opened up nearly 12 miles ( 19 km ) of waterway . As part of the upgrade , new 48 @-@ hour moorings were constructed on The Haven , for boats about to enter the Drain , and on the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain near the Black Sluice pumping station at Boston , at <unk> Bridge and at Hubbert 's Bridge . The upper limit of navigation was initially Donington High Bridge , where the Swaton Eau joins the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain and provides a wider section where boats can be turned . Beyond the bridge , the drain was officially only suitable for canoes and kayaks . However , eight narrow boats cruised on the waterway at Easter 2009 , and although the channel was narrower and not as deep after Donington Bridge , all of them successfully reached Kingston 's Bridge , some 3 @.@ 7 miles ( 6 @.@ 0 km ) further on , where the outlets from <unk> Fen and <unk> pumping stations provided enough width to turn a 70 @-@ foot ( 21 m ) boat . Further progress was blocked by scaffolding erected so that the bridge could be re @-@ decked , rather than by lack of water . 
 The drain has been renamed as the Black Sluice Navigation by the Environment Agency . In order to use the navigation , an Environment Agency licence is required , and as there are no permanent moorings available on the drain , these are available for one day or seven days . Water levels are maintained at a lower level during the winter months , when flows are high , and the Drain needs to be able to cope with higher volumes of rainfall , than during the summer months , when navigable levels are maintained . As on the neighbouring River Witham , the switch between winter and summer levels is normally made at the beginning of April .

 Phase 2 of the Fens Waterway project involves the link between Donington Bridge and Crowland and Cowbit Washes , which are located on the River Welland near Spalding . In order to make the financing of the phase more viable , it was split into two halves , with phase 2a covering the section from Donington to Surfleet Seas End on the River Glen , and phase 2b covering from there onwards . The initial technical assessment and obtaining of planning permission for phase 2 , which involved widening of the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain from Donington to a new road crossing under the <unk> , a new lock and a junction with the River Glen at Guthram Gowt was funded by the East Midlands Development Agency . This section would involve changes at Black Hole Drove pumping station , which has been built across the drain and hence would prevent navigation . Major contracts for this phase were expected to be awarded in April 2009 , but appraisal of the technical assessment revealed that more than one route needed to be considered before the best solution could be selected . While the obvious solution would be to connect the Glen and the drain where they are only a short distance apart , the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership also considered the creation of new channels up to 9 @.@ 3 miles ( 15 @.@ 0 km ) long to form the link . In the meantime , the economic situation changed , so that sources of funding were not so freely available , and by the end of 2010 , no clear dates had been set for the next construction phase . 
 By late 2011 , there were ten different routes under consideration , and an assessment of them was expected to be delivered in spring 2012 . Halcrow Group , the engineering consultancy , were responsible for carrying out the assessment , which looked at the benefits that each route might provide , not only for navigation but also for water quality , water resources and habitat for wildlife . The study was expected to provide a short @-@ list of routes , which would then be the subject of further consultation . By mid @-@ 2012 , the merits of the ten routes had been considered , including the economic , environmental and technical issues involved , and a broad outline of the corridor for the link was scheduled to be published in September . After that , consultation with landowners and stakeholders took place , to establish the final route , for which design of the channel and the associated locks , bridges , moorings and pumping stations could then begin . By the end of the assessment process for the ten routes , two remained . One was route 1 , the original suggestion which used the existing course of the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain for most of its length , while the second was a new route , designated as route 11 . Route 11 had become the preferred route by the summer of 2014 . It involves widening the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain from Donington to Surfleet , to a point near to the Black Hole Drove pumping station . A new lock would be needed at this location , but would connect to a new channel , rather than to the rest of the drain . It would pass under a new bridge on the <unk> , and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock . An environmental survey of other watercourses near to the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates .

 The idea of a link between the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain and the River Nene is not new , as the first plans for such a connection were proposed in 1809 . In that year , proposals for a new canal between the Oakham Canal at Oakham and the Stamford Canal at Stamford , which had been discussed in 1785 , were revived , as part of a larger plan for a 7 @-@ mile ( 11 km ) link from Stamford to the River Nene at Peterborough , and a connection from near Market Deeping , where the Stamford Canal rejoined the River Welland , northwards to the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain . A bill for this , together with one for a rival scheme to link Stamford to the Grand Junction Canal , which also included a connection to the South Forty @-@ Foot Drain , were put before Parliament in 1811 , but neither met with any success . The idea was raised again in 1815 and 1828 , but no further action was taken .

 = American Tragedy ( album ) = 
 American Tragedy is the second studio album by American rap rock band Hollywood Undead . Production for the album began following the induction of Daniel Murillo into the band in early 2010 and lasted until December . Don Gilmore and Ben Grosse , who helped produce the band 's debut album , Swan Songs ( 2008 ) , also returned to produce the album along with several other producers including Kevin Rudolf , Sam Hollander , Dave Katz , Griffin Boice , Jeff <unk> , and Jacob Kasher . The album is musically heavier and features darker lyrical content than the band 's previous effort . Originally set to release in March , American Tragedy was released on April 5 , 2011 in the United States and was released on various other dates that month in other countries . A remix of the album , American Tragedy Redux , was released on November 21 , 2011 . 
 The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 , selling approximately 67 @,@ 000 copies in its first week in the United States , and ended up becoming the 142nd best selling album of 2011 in the US . It also charted in a few other countries , including Canada and the UK , a first for the band . The album also had five singles : " Hear Me Now " , " Been to Hell " , " Coming Back Down " , " Comin ' in Hot " , and " My Town " , with music videos being made for all of them except " Coming Back Down " as it was released on the same day as " Been to Hell " . The band participated in three headlining tours : the Revolt Tour , the Endless Summer Tour , and the World War III Tour , as well as other supporting tours throughout 2011 to promote the album . Upon release , American Tragedy received mixed reviews . Critics consistently noted the darker and more serious tone of the album , but to mixed reception . Lyrics were widely criticized while the energy and instruments were praised in most reviews . 
 = = Singles and promotion = = 
 To promote the album , the band participated in three headlining tours and several other supporting tours . The first headlining tour , the Revolt Tour , began on April 6 and spanned across the spring until May 27 , playing with Drive @-@ A , New Medicine , 10 Years , and others at various House of Blues venues across North America . The second headlining tour for the album was the Endless Summer Tour with All That Remains and <unk> Da Hero which began in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , and ended in Knoxville , Tennessee . The third tour was the World War III Tour , which the band called the biggest tour they had done yet . The tour was co @-@ headlined with Asking Alexandria with support acts We Came As Romans , <unk> , and Borgore , with different local openers for each location . For supporting tours , the band began with the Nightmare After Christmas Tour with headliners Avenged Sevenfold and supporters Stone Sour and New Medicine on January 20 , 2011 , which was the first supporting tour for the album . Outside of official tours , the band played several festivals throughout 2011 including <unk> in Mesa , Arizona , Rockfest , and Summerfest in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . The band also played various holiday shows , such as a Cinco De Mayo show in Salt Lake City , Utah , with Flogging Molly and others . 
 The album spawned five singles in total . On December 8 , 2010 , the band released the artwork for the album 's first single , titled " Hear Me Now " . The track was released on December 13 for radio and was made available online a week later on December 21 . " Hear Me Now " was the album 's most successful single , charting variously on the Billboard Heatseeker charts , Alternative charts , and the Rock charts . On March 22 , the band appeared live on the late night talk show Lopez Tonight as a musical guest where they performed the single " Hear Me Now " to promote the album . The band reportedly almost drank the entire bar behind the Turner Broadcasting System set , with George Lopez saying to J @-@ Dog , " Drink all of it . Go ahead , I don ’ t care . But I 've never seen anyone drink that much . " The album 's second and third official singles , " Been to Hell " and " Coming Back Down " , were both released on March 15 , 2011 . " Been to Hell " was previously released as a promotional single with a lyric video on February 6 , but was then released as a single with a music video , leading to it chart on Billboard 's Heatseeker and Bubbling Under Hot 100 charts . Because " Coming Back Down " was released on the same day as " Been to Hell " , the track did not get a music video . " Coming Back Down " previously surfaced due to a leak on February 18 and was later confirmed to be on the album and was produced by Kevin Rudolf . Brian Voerding noted that the song showed the band 's strength in both singing and rapping while comparing the sound to Linkin Park . The album 's fourth single , " Comin ' in Hot " , was released on April 9 with a music video to celebrate the album 's release . Similar to " Been to Hell " , " Comin ' in Hot " was originally a free promotional single released on January 21 , but was later released as an album single following the release of American Tragedy . The track was reviewed by Evigshed along with " Hear Me Now " after it was released as a promotional single , who gave both " Comin ' in Hot " and " Hear Me Now " a perfect ten out of ten score , noting that " Comin ' in Hot " was much more upbeat and was extremely catchy . On July 8 , it was announced the fifth single for the album would be " My Town " . The band began shooting the music video in early July and announced that fans would be featured in the video if they recorded themselves performing the song in front of a famous landmark . The video has no release date yet . 
 = = Music and lyrical themes = = 
 American Tragedy opens with the single " Been to Hell " . J @-@ Dog said that the song is , " the truth about what really happens to people when they move to L.A. , to be actors or models or God knows what other delusions people have ... failure . It 's all too true , but most people aren 't there to see it first @-@ hand . But we are , so it 's our interpretation of it all . " The track is followed by " Apologize " , a track that directly addresses critics and states the band 's defiance in the face of negative opinions , as evident by the chorus , " We don 't apologize and that 's just the way it is , but we can harmonize even if we sound like shit . " Third is " Comin ’ in Hot " , a party song and the album 's fourth single that uses humor to describe what happens in night clubs . " My Town " is the fifth single and a mid @-@ tempo song talking about Los Angeles and Hollywood . Next is " I Don 't Wanna Die " , a song about the fear of death fueling the need to kill another person . " Hear Me Now " was the lead single from the album and is about the troubles each band member was going through at the time the song was written . The song 's lyrics tell the story of a person who is depressed and hopeless , taking a very somber tone to the track . Despite this , the instruments and melodies contrast to make an uptempo track . Next is " Gangsta Sexy " , a party anthem song about heading to nightclubs and pursuing women . The following track , " Glory " , is a metal @-@ inspired song which drew influence from war and fighting . " Lights Out " , the ninth song on the album , is about Deuce , ex @-@ vocalist of Hollywood Undead . It is a response to " Story of a Snitch " . " Coming Back Down " , the third single released from the album , is a rock ballad song with acoustic guitars on the track . The lyrics describes about a story of an unknown loved one who has recently died , with the narrator having difficulty trying to live without them . " Bullet " , the eleventh track from the album , is an uptempo pop song about suicide . It is played in an upbeat tempo with energetic vocals , which gives contrast to the dark lyrical content . Rick Florino called the track , " heart @-@ wrenching genius " . " Levitate " is an uptempo discothèque song about sex , while the verses of the song talk about suicide and alcoholism . It was also featured in the Need For Speed : Shift 2 Unleashed trailer , " <unk> Drift Challenge " , as well as on the game 's soundtrack , where it was ranked eighth on <unk> 's list of " Top ten songs featured in racing games " . 
 " Pour Me " , the last soft song on the album , is a dark ballad that has been often compared to Eminem 's " Stan " . Johnny 3 Tears stated that , " We were messing around with chord progressions and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it . It 's melodic and poppy sounding . We 're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes drink too much . It 's one of those basic every day things that people go through but they don 't know how to voice it or others around them don 't know to voice it . It 's almost like you 're looked down upon , but no one actually talks about it . " " Tendencies " , which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album , is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder . Johnny 3 Tears said , " When we wrote Tendencies , I wanted to make a song that kids would just go nuts to when we played it . Kids start <unk> at our shows . Not every song we have is the best mosh song , so I wanted to make a song kids could go crazy for . " 
 While the band was touring with Avenged Sevenfold , the guitarist <unk> Gates spoke about " <unk> " stating " Holy shit , that 's the craziest verse I 've ever heard ! The lyrics are insane . "

 Prior to release , American Tragedy was projected by several publications to sell about 65 @,@ 000 copies in the first week of release in the United States , and was expected to reach number three on the Billboard 200 . When the official sales week ended , the album exceeded expectations and sold about 67 @,@ 000 copies , but was outsold by Radiohead 's The King of Limbs and so debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 . Weekly sales topped albums such as Wiz Khalifa 's Rolling Papers and Chris Brown 's F.A.M.E. , and was right behind Adele 's 21 , Britney Spears 's Femme Fatale , and Radiohead 's The King of Limbs . 
 Upon learning of the album 's first @-@ week sales , Jordan <unk> , also known to fans of the band as " Charlie Scene . " jokingly remarked , " I gotta be honest with everyone : I was really looking forward to the opportunity to be on top of Britney this week , but being right behind her and Adele is a memory we ’ ll relish forever . " The album also debuted at number one on the US Hard Rock charts , number two on the US Rock , Digital , and Alternative charts , and number 11 on the Tastemaker Albums charts . Outside of the US , American Tragedy charted number five in Canadian albums charts and number 43 in the UK albums charts .

 At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 59 , based on 6 reviews , which indicates " mixed or average reviews " . 
 Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave American Tragedy 5 out of 5 , particularly praising the band 's choice to avoid duplicating their debut album , Swan Songs , and instead choosing to create a , " darker , deeper , and far deadlier ride this time around . " Florino compared various elements of the album to the Wu Tang Clan and Nine Inch Nails , particularly comparing the album 's production ( which was done by various producers with executive producer Don Gilmore ) to Nine Inch Nails ' second album The Downward Spiral ( 1994 ) . He also lauded the irony of the quality singing on , " Apologize " , combined with the lyrics , " But we can harmonize , even if we sound like shit . " Florino concluded that , " Hollywood Undead 's genius lies — in that dangerous space between unforgettable and unsettling , " pointing this out in the track , " Bullet " , for it being the , " sunniest and catchiest tune on American Tragedy , " while still telling , " a potent and poignant tale of longing for suicide . " The other track Florino pointed out for being unforgettable is , " Pour Me " , calling it , " an evil power ballad that everyone who hears it will feel . " 
 Revolver magazine reviewer Jeremy Borjon gave the album four out of five in his review , calling American Tragedy , " one hell of an album that will leave fans ’ heads buzzing long after the clubs have let out and the hangover sets in . " Borjon complimented the shift in moods throughout the album and the lyrical quality compared to Swan Songs . He praised several tracks including " Been to Hell " , " Apologize " , " Comin ' in Hot " , " Bullet " , " Levitate " , and " Tendencies " as numerous outstanding points in the album . Borjon did criticize the slower songs , " Coming Back Down " and " Pour Me " but dismissed that that were , " easily forgotten among the album 's many undeniably addictive future hits . " Richard Solomon of The Minaret proclaimed that , " If you ’ re a Hollywood Undead fan , you 'll love American Tragedy . As for people who didn ’ t care for Swan Songs , you 'll probably still love American Tragedy . " Instrumentally , Solomon noted one of his only complaints of the album , being that , " At times , the synthesizer seems a little too heavy handed , but it succeeds more often than not . " Solomon complimented the album being different and further encouraged the Deluxe Edition tracks in addition to the album itself . 
 Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was more critical in his review . He praised the energy of the album , pointing out the , " Booming groove , " of " Apologize " , and the " disco @-@ metal urgency , " of " Levitate " . Wood 's biggest complaint of the album was that the band has , " filtered out any sense of humor from its music , which makes American Tragedy virtually impossible to listen to for longer than a few songs at a time . " Alistair Lawrence of BBC Music said that the album is , " The result is that they ’ ve ditched some of the early , growling quirkiness that at least gave them an initial , oddball appeal . " Lawrence finishes his review noting , " Hollywood Undead are content to deliver clichés – more out of a lack of imagination than cynical opportunism , but it still smacks of both . That 's why to seasoned ears or any genre fan requiring more than more of the same , they ’ re very , very boring . "

 = Karlsruhe @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Karlsruhe class of light cruisers was a pair of two ships built for the German Imperial Navy before the start of World War I. The ships — SMS Karlsruhe and Rostock — were very similar to the previous Magdeburg @-@ class cruisers , mounting the same armament and similar armor protection , though they were larger and faster than the earlier ships . Both vessels were laid down in 1911 , and launched one day apart , on 11 and 12 November 1912 . Karlsruhe joined the fleet in January 1914 , but fitting out work lasted slightly longer on her sister ; Rostock was commissioned the following month . 
 Both of the ships had short service careers . Karlsruhe was assigned to overseas duty in the Caribbean , arriving on station in July 1914 , days before the outbreak of World War I. Once the war began , she armed the passenger liner SS Kronprinz Wilhelm so it could raid British shipping . After a moderately successful commerce raiding career , during which Karlsruhe sank sixteen merchant ships and successfully evaded British cruisers , she sank after an accidental internal explosion on 4 November 1914 . Most of her crew were killed in the sinking , but the survivors returned to Germany on one of Karlsruhe 's attendant colliers by December . 
 Rostock served as a torpedo boat flotilla leader with the High Seas Fleet following her commissioning ; her flotilla frequently screened for the battlecruisers in the I Scouting Group , including during the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and operations off the British coast in early 1916 . She saw heavy action during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 as part of the screen for the main battle fleet . In the ferocious night fighting that occurred as the German fleet punched through the British rear @-@ guard , Rostock was torpedoed by a British destroyer , which immobilized the ship . She was taken under tow by several torpedo boats , but early on the morning of 1 June , the cruiser HMS Dublin located the cruiser . To prevent her capture by the British , the Germans scuttled the ship after taking off her crew . 
 = = Design = = 
 The design for the Karlsruhe class was prepared in 1910 , and was an incremental improvement over the previous Magdeburg class . Karlsruhe and Rostock were faster and had a larger , more raked hull and greater displacement , but had the same armament and armor protection . Karlsruhe was ordered as Ersatz Seeadler and laid down in 1911 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel , under construction number 181 . She was launched on 11 November 1912 and commissioned into the fleet on 15 January 1914 . Rostock was ordered as Ersatz Geier and laid down in 1911 at the Howaldtswerke dockyard in Kiel , under construction number 560 . Launching ceremonies took place on 12 November 1912 , a day after her sister . She was completed on 5 February 1914 , the date she joined the fleet . 
 = = = Dimensions and machinery = = = 
 The Karlsruhe class ships were 139 meters ( 456 ft ) long at the waterline and 142 @.@ 2 m ( 467 ft ) long overall . They had a beam of 13 @.@ 7 m ( 45 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 38 m ( 17 @.@ 7 ft ) forward and 6 @.@ 2 m ( 20 ft ) aft . They displaced 4 @,@ 900 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 800 long tons ; 5 @,@ 400 short tons ) at designed load and 6 @,@ 191 t ( 6 @,@ 093 long tons ; 6 @,@ 824 short tons ) at full combat loading . The hull was constructed with longitudinal steel frames and incorporated fifteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 45 percent of the length of the hull . The ships had a crew of eighteen officers and 355 enlisted men . Karlsruhe and Rostock carried a number of smaller vessels , including one picket boat , one barge , one cutter , two yawls , and two dinghies . After 1915 , Rostock had spotting tops installed on her masts . The German Navy regarded the two ships as good sea boats . They suffered from slight weather helm in a swell and made severe leeway . They were maneuverable but were slow steering into a turn . With the rudder hard over , they lost up to 60 percent speed . Their transverse metacentric height was .79 m ( 2 ft 7 in ) . 
 Karlsruhe and Rostock were powered by two sets of Marine @-@ type steam turbines , each of which drove a three @-@ bladed screw 3 @.@ 5 m ( 11 ft ) in diameter . Each turbine was divided into its own engine room ; steam was supplied by twelve coal @-@ fired water tube boilers and two oil @-@ fired double @-@ ended water tube boilers split into five boiler rooms . The propulsion system was rated at 26 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 19 @,@ 000 kW ) and a top speed of 27 @.@ 8 knots ( 51 @.@ 5 km / h ; 32 @.@ 0 mph ) , but both ships significantly exceeded these figures on speed trials . Karlsruhe made 37 @,@ 885 shp ( 28 @,@ 251 kW ) at 28 @.@ 5 knots ( 52 @.@ 8 km / h ; 32 @.@ 8 mph ) and Rostock reached 43 @,@ 628 shp ( 32 @,@ 533 kW ) and 29 @.@ 3 knots ( 54 @.@ 3 km / h ; 33 @.@ 7 mph ) . Designed coal and oil storage was 400 t ( 394 long tons ; 441 short tons ) and 70 t ( 69 long tons ; 77 short tons ) , respectively , though internal voids could accommodate up to 1 @,@ 300 t ( 1 @,@ 279 long tons ; 1 @,@ 433 short tons ) and 200 t ( 197 long tons ; 220 short tons ) , respectively . Electrical power was supplied by two turbo generators rated at 240 and 200 kilowatts , respectively , at 220 volts . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 Karlsruhe and Rostock were armed identically to the previous Magdeburg @-@ class cruisers . They carried twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , eight were located amidships , four on either side , and two were side by side aft . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees , which allowed them to engage targets out to 12 @,@ 700 m ( 41 @,@ 700 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 800 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . The ships were also equipped with a pair of 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside . They could also carry 120 mines . 
 The ships ' armor was also identical to the preceding class . They were protected by a waterline armored belt that was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick amidships ; the belt was reduced to 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 71 in ) forward . The stern was not armored . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides and a 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick roof . The deck was covered with 60 mm thick armor plate forward , 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) amidships , and 20 mm aft . Sloped armor 40 mm thick connected the deck to the belt armor .

 After her commissioning , Karlsruhe was assigned to overseas duties in the Caribbean , where she was to relieve the cruiser Dresden . She arrived in the area in July 1914 , days before the outbreak of World War I. Once the war began , she armed the passenger liner SS Kronprinz Wilhelm so it could operate as a commerce raider , but while the ships were transferring equipment , British cruisers located them and pursued Karlsruhe . Her superior speed allowed her to escape , after which she operated off the northeastern coast of Brazil . 
 Karlsruhe refueled at Puerto Rico , a possession of the then neutral United States before steaming to Brazil . Off the Brazilian coast , she captured or sank sixteen ships totaling 72 @,@ 805 gross register tons ( GRT ) while eluding her pursuers . The ship 's captain then decided to operate against the shipping lanes to Barbados . While en route on 4 November 1914 , a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship and killed the majority of the crew , including her captain . The survivors used one of <unk> 's colliers to return to Germany in December 1914 .

 Rostock served with the High Seas Fleet as a leader of torpedo boat flotillas for the duration of her career . She served with the screens for both Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper 's battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group on operations against the British coast and the Battle of Dogger Bank . During the battle , British battlecruisers ambushed the German squadron and sank the armored cruiser Blücher . In April 1916 , she again screened the battlecruisers during the bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft , during which Rostock and five other cruisers briefly engaged the British Harwich Force . 
 She was assigned to the screen for the battle fleet during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 . She saw major action at Jutland and frequently engaged British light forces , including assisting in the destruction of the destroyers HMS Nomad and Nestor . Rostock 's participation in the battle culminated in her torpedoing by destroyers shortly after midnight . She was taken under tow by German torpedo boats , but the following morning the cruiser HMS Dublin came upon the retreating ships . To prevent Rostock 's capture , the Germans set scuttling charges aboard her and took off the crew before firing torpedoes into the disabled cruiser to ensure she sank . 
 = Chakotay = 
 Chakotay / <unk> / is a fictional character who appears in each of the seven seasons of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Voyager . Portrayed by Robert Beltran , he is First Officer aboard the Starfleet starship USS Voyager . The character was suggested at an early stage of the development of the series . He is the first Native American main character in the Star Trek franchise . This was an intended move by the producers of the series , who sought to provide an inspiration as with Uhura in Star Trek : The Original Series for African Americans . To develop the character , the producers sought the assistance of Jamake Highwater . Despite first being named as a Sioux , and later a Hopi , Chakotay was given no tribal affiliation at the start of the series , something that was later resolved in the episode " Tattoo " . 
 The character first appeared in the pilot episode of the series , " Caretaker " . The character continued to appear throughout the series in a main cast role , with his final appearance in the finale , " Endgame " . He was featured in an ongoing storyline throughout the first and second seasons which featured the betrayal of his lover Seska ( Martha Hackett ) until her death in " Basics " . Following his experience with disconnected Borg in " Unity " , Chakotay was against an alliance with the Borg in " Scorpion " , nearly leading to the death of Seven of Nine ( Jeri Ryan ) . Despite this , by the end of the series , the two characters were in a romantic relationship together . In the Voyager relaunch novels set after the vessel 's return to the Alpha Quadrant , Chakotay is promoted to Captain of the ship but the relationship with Seven is ended . 
 Reviewers of Chakotay were critical of the stereotypical nature of Chakotay 's Native American heritage . This led to comparisons with Tonto from The Lone Ranger , and that the inclusion of " Hollywood " versions of vision quests and meditation techniques were contrary to the character 's in @-@ universe tribal background . However , he was praised as a role model for Native American science fiction and called " ground @-@ breaking " , as well as the most prominent example of a Native American character within this genre . 
 = = Concept and development = = 
 The inclusion of a Native American character in Star Trek : Voyager was suggested at an early stage in the development of the series . The producers were looking for an ethnic background which had not been seen before as a main character in the franchise . It was hoped that a Native American character would prove to be an inspiration in the same way that the appearance of Uhura in Star Trek : The Original Series later inspired Whoopi Goldberg and other African Americans . Executive producer Jeri Taylor said , " It seemed to us that Native Americans needed that same kind of role model and that same kind of boost ... the future looks good , you have purpose , you have worth , you have value , you will be leaders , you will be powerful . That was one character choice we had early on . " Taylor 's notes from the early production in July 1993 describe the character as " First Officer – a human native American male , a ' Queequeg ' person who has renounced Earth and lives as an expatriate on another planet . A mystical , mysterious man with whom the Captain has some prior connection , not explained . " A month later , this description was expanded with the line , " This man has made another choice – to re @-@ enter the world of Starfleet . " Chakotay was not the first Native American character to appear in the franchise , with " The Paradise Syndrome " in the third season of Star Trek : The Original Series showing a group of displaced humans following a Native @-@ American @-@ like culture . 
 The producers aimed to develop some conflict between the members of the crew to produce a scenario similar to the Bajoran / Starfleet relationship seen in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , but wanted the characters to share the same ideals . To do this , the Maquis were created – a group of Federation colonists from the Cardassian border in a disputed territory who were joined by some Starfleet officers who joined them to fight for their rights . The producers had the Maquis introduced in other Star Trek series before Voyager in four episodes ; two in Star Trek : The Next Generation and two in Deep Space Nine . It was a deliberate reference to the political situation in the West Bank . 
 In developing Chakotay , the producers sought the assistance of Jamake Highwater , a writer of more than 25 books of both fiction and nonfiction related to Native American myths and traditions . Highwater was a controversial choice of advisor , having been exposed by Hank Adams and Vine <unk> , Jr. as taking a fake Native American ancestry to sell books . Around September 21 , 1993 , Highwater gave seven pages of notes to producers regarding Chakotay 's backstory , but his tribal ancestry was unresolved . By the end of that month , Michael Piller drafted the first version of the writer 's bible for the series in which the character was named " <unk> " . By the time Piller wrote the first draft of the story that eventually became the Voyager pilot " Caretaker " , the character was known as " Chakotay " and been made a Sioux . By the third draft of the story , submitted at the start of November , he had become a Hopi , but by the following February , he once again had no tribal affiliation . 
 Winrich Kolbe , the director of " Caretaker " , was involved in casting the main cast for the series . He described the casting process for the part of Chakotay as difficult due to the lower numbers of Native Americans who were in the Screen Actors Guild . The casting process came down to two actors , and the producers decided on Robert Beltran , who until then was best known for appearing in the soap opera Models Inc. and was of Mexican heritage . Beltran was not familiar with Star Trek before auditioning , and went along on the strength of the " Caretaker " script which showed the character becoming the second in command of Voyager after both their vessels are stranded in the Delta quadrant . Beltran explained the audition experience , " I felt neutral about the audition , didn 't much care one way or the other . I went in the first time and wasn 't really trying to get the part . They asked to see me again , and they wanted to see more of an edge to the character . " 
 Chakotay was originally written as a " calm , stoic " character , but Beltran expanded on the character during the audition process , something that Kolbe credited him for . The writer 's bible described Chakotay as a very traditional Native American with an altar and traditional art in his quarters . It also mentioned his spirit guide , something which was picked up in the media report in TV Guide . Beltran wore a facial tattoo whilst playing Chakotay , which was applied with make @-@ up . This earned him comparisons to boxer Mike Tyson after the latter gained a facial tattoo . The design was created by Michael Westmore , who deliberately created it so it did not represent any particular tribal culture . The in @-@ universe story of the tattoo and Chakotay 's tribal origins were explained in the episode " Tattoo " . 
 Beltran gained the reputation on @-@ set as a comedian . Following the first season and during a group interview with The Washington Times , Beltran joked that he was asked to perform in Hamlet during the summer in Albuquerque , but had been asked to wear Chakotay 's facial tattoo . During that time he worked on the Oliver Stone film Nixon ( 1995 ) . During the period when Voyager was run by Taylor and Piller as the executive producers , Beltran gave feedback on the character which was taken into account . He later explained that this ended following the introduction of Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine onto the cast and Brannon Braga taking over from Taylor and Piller . Beltran felt that Chakotay was one of the characters alongside Harry Kim , Tuvok , and Neelix who were left behind by the new writers , who tended to concentrate on Janeway , Seven , and The Doctor . 
 Beltran said that he was not aware of the effects of the interactions this was having with the crew , and described the situation , saying , " for me it was like , ' OK , you can fire me if you want to . Go ahead , and I 'll leave . ' " He compared his experience on Voyager to working in a car factory , and said that the repetitive scenes meant that it limited his creativity . Beltran explained that it did not affect his relationship with the other actors , and in the end , he felt the producers decided to keep him on the cast as it did not make " very much difference , except to a very , very small percentage of fans who maybe didn 't like what I said . " 
 In an interview to publicise the final episode of Voyager , " Endgame " , Beltran said , " We all had a great relationship with each other and we 've all said how much we enjoy our crew . We have a terrific crew . But at the same time , I 'm looking forward to what 's next . It 's exciting to know that something unknown is next . " The final episode introduced a romance between Seven of Nine and Chakotay . Ryan found this confusing for the characters , as although it had been suggested in the episode " Human Error " , the producers told the pair to forget about the relationship in the in @-@ between episodes until the finale .

 Chakotay 's backstory was explained during the course of Star Trek : Voyager . He was born in 2329 on a Federation colony near Cardassian space in the demilitarized zone . While young , he was looked after by his grandfather . At the age of 15 , Chakotay visited Earth with his father , who sought to find his tribe 's ancestral home in Central America and the descendants of the Rubber Tree People . He was resistant to this , and instead dreamed of going into space and had heroes such as John Kelly , a pioneering astronaut in the early 21st century . He chose to enter Starfleet Academy against his father 's wishes , and his entry was sponsored by Captain Sulu . [ A ] He attended Starfleet Academy from 2344 to <unk> , where he engaged in the sport of boxing . After graduating , he was assigned to a starship . One of his earliest away missions resulted in a diplomatic incident on <unk> VII , and he was also on the team that made first contact with the <unk> . 
 He was assigned as an instructor in Starfleet 's Advanced Tactical Training and achieved the rank of lieutenant commander . Following the death of his father in 2368 while defending his colony from the Cardassians , Chakotay resigned his Starfleet commission and joined the Maquis . At the time of his resignation , one of his students was Ro Laren . After he joined the Maquis , he became captain of a vessel named the Val Jean , with a crew which among others included his lover Seska ( Martha Hackett ) , B 'Elanna Torres ( Roxann Dawson ) , and Tuvok ( Tim Russ ) .

 = = = = The Kazon and Seska = = = = 
 In the pilot episode of Voyager , while the crew on the Val Jean seek to evade a Cardassian vessel captained by Gul <unk> ( Richard Poe ) in the Badlands , the vessel is transported some 70 @,@ 000 light years across the galaxy into the Delta Quadrant by the creature known as the Caretaker . After the Federation starship USS Voyager is also trapped in the Delta Quadrant and Tuvok was revealed to be a Starfleet agent , Chakotay agrees with Captain Kathryn Janeway ( Kate Mulgrew ) to work together to find two of their missing crew . Following an attack by the Kazon , Chakotay destroyed the Val Jean to save Voyager and the Maquis crew joined the Federation ship . Chakotay was given a provisional rank of commander and named executive officer , the second @-@ in @-@ command of the vessel and the crew seeks to return home to the Alpha Quadrant . 
 The Kazon continue to be a hindrance during Voyager 's initial period in the Delta Quadrant , with Chakotay dismayed in " State of Flux " when Seska is revealed as a Cardassian spy who has been providing technology to the Kazon to seek an alliance . She escapes Voyager and sides with the Kazon @-@ <unk> , one of the factions within that species . Chakotay is rendered brain dead , but is made into a disembodied spirit able to possess other crewmembers in " Cathexis " . The incident occurs while Tuvok and he were investigating a dark matter nebula , and he sought to prevent the ship from returning there , as an alien species wants to feed on the crew 's neural energy . After Voyager enters the nebula , Chakotay possesses Neelix ( Ethan Phillips ) and guides the ship out using a medicine wheel as a map . Shortly afterwards , The Doctor ( Robert Picardo ) is able to restore Chakotay 's mind into his body . At the end of the first season , Chakotay supported Tuvok 's aim of helping the former Maquis crew adapt better to life on Voyager in " Learning Curve " , by showing them the enforcement techniques of the Maquis . 
 In the second season episode " Tattoo " , Chakotay meets with an alien race who influenced the ancestors of his tribe . They perceived Voyager as a threat because they had thought his people had been wiped out . He was able to resolve the problem using the teachings of his father . The Kazon returned and attacked Voyager in " Maneuvers " , where they stole a transporter control module . Chakotay took it upon himself to retrieve the device , recognising that Seska was behind it . He managed to destroy it , but was captured and tortured by the Kazon in the process . He was rescued by Voyager , and shortly afterwards , he was contacted by Seska , who informed him that she had impregnated herself with his DNA . In " Resolutions " , Chakotay and Janeway are infected with a virus which requires them to quarantine themselves on a nearby planet . The two began to show signs of affection for each other , but their stay is short @-@ lived after Voyager under the captaincy of Tuvok agrees a deal with the <unk> for a cure . The pair agree to return to the status quo on Voyager , but remain good friends . 
 Chakotay was contacted by Seska in " Basics " to say that his son had been born , and the Kazon were threatening to condemn her to the life of a slave . Voyager attempted to extract Seska and the child , but it was a trap and resulted in the Kazon boarding the vessel and stranding the Federation / Maquis crew on a nearby planet . While Tom Paris ( Robert Duncan McNeil ) , The Doctor , and Lon <unk> ( Brad Dourif ) , along with allied <unk> forces , sought to retake Voyager , Chakotay was instrumental in the crew 's survival on the planet . He saved Kes ( Jennifer Lien ) from a local tribe , and built an alliance with them . The crew retook Voyager , and in the process Seska was killed . The child was discovered not to be Chakotay 's , but instead a Cardassian / Kazon hybrid and the son of the Kazon @-@ <unk> leader First <unk> <unk> ( Anthony De <unk> ) . 
 = = = = Entering Borg space = = = = 
 The first indication that Voyager was approaching Borg space was shown in the episode " Unity " . While investigating a Federation distress call in a shuttlecraft , Chakotay was injured by the natives of a planet . Another group saves him , and Chakotay discovers that the colonists are former Borg whose access to the main hive @-@ mind was disrupted . He is linked to a local hive @-@ mind to help him to heal , and after being returned to Voyager , he is forced against his will to reactivate the colonists ' former Borg Cube . Chakotay is released from the new " cooperative " after the Cube self @-@ destructs , leaving the planet with a hive @-@ mind separate from the main collective . Chakotay is captured by the Voth scientist Gegen ( Henry Woronicz ) in " Distant Origin " , who is seeking to prove his hypothesis that the Voth came from Earth . When Gegen is placed on trial by his people , Chakotay seeks to argue in his defense . Ultimately , Gegen is forced to back down to save Voyager after the Voth threaten to destroy the vessel . Before they depart , Chakotay gives a model globe of the Earth to Gegen as a present . 
 His experience with the disconnected Borg resulted in Chakotay being against a plan to ally with the Borg against Species 8472 in " Scorpion " , causing conflict between Captain Janeway and him . The alliance results in Seven of Nine and a number of other Borg drones being placed on Voyager and Janeway injured . Although he was ordered to continue with the alliance , Chakotay seeks to renegotiate the alliance , but Seven refuses any changes . When she opens a rift to <unk> Space , Chakotay decompresses the cargo bay , sending all the Borg drones out into space with the exception of Seven . Later , when the Borg attempt to double @-@ cross Voyager , Chakotay activates his localised neural link , confusing Seven and allowing Torres to disable her link to the Collective permanently . 
 During the " Year of Hell " , Chakotay is captured by the Krenim scientist Annorax ( Kurtwood Smith ) on a Time Ship . The two first attempt to work together as Annorax agrees to restore the now damaged Voyager if Chakotay complies with his demands . After Annorax wipes out a species , though , he helps to disable the ship , allowing Captain Janeway to destroy it by ramming Voyager into it . This results in the timeline being reset , and the events of the episode were undone . In " Unforgettable " , he falls in love with Kellin ( Virginia Madsen ) , a member of a xenophobic race who have developed a technology to prevent others from forming long @-@ term memories of them . As such , he is informed that they were previously in love when she was on Voyager a month earlier , and rekindle their relationship despite Chakotay not remembering the earlier encounter . Another member of her race removes Kellin 's memories of Chakotay and installs a virus to remove all records of their race . Chakotay takes to writing out his memories of Kellin on paper so that he will not forget them . 
 He was placed in command of Voyager after Seven was captured by the Borg in " Dark Frontier " and destroyed a transwarp conduit . Chakotay is later one of the members of the crew who were captured by Borg children in " Collective " and was saved after Seven 's intervention . Initially , Chakotay and Seven did not get along , but he would come to realise that he was mistaken in that opinion . Towards the end of the seventh season in " Human Error " , Seven simulates a relationship with Chakotay on the holodeck . A Borg implant was preventing her from feeling strong emotions without any physical ill effects , which prevented her from seeking a romantic relationship with the real Chakotay . By the time of the series finale , " Endgame " , The Doctor had managed to remove the implant , allowing Seven to pursue a relationship with Chakotay . The alternative future seen at the start of the episode showed that Seven and Chakotay were eventually married , but she died while Voyager was still travelling home . Chakotay died following Voyager 's return , and Admiral Janeway visits his grave marker in that episode . This future was undone by the future Janeway travelling back in time to Voyager to return it to Earth sooner . 
 = = = Voyager relaunch novels = = = 
 In the noncanonical Voyager relaunch novels , written by Christie Golden , Chakotay is promoted after the ship returns to Federation space , and becomes Captain of Voyager . He and Seven of Nine break off their relationship . In Old Wounds , the first of the Spirit Walk two @-@ book series , the crew goes on their maiden cruise under Captain Chakotay and is joined by his sister , <unk> , who 's become a spiritual leader in their tribe . In the second book , Enemy of my Enemy , Chakotay is replaced by a Founder who was previously pretending to be his first officer . Meanwhile , the real Chakotay and his sister are being held by a deranged Cardassian doctor , forcing Chakotay to undergo a spirit walk to save them both . 
 Janeway and Chakotay became romantically involved after their return from the Delta Quadrant , and following her death after her assimilation by the Borg in the Star Trek : The Next Generation novel Before Dishonor , Chakotay resigns his commission and <unk> Eden becomes the new Captain of Voyager . However , in the very next novel by Kirsten Beyer , <unk> , Eden is promoted to fleet commander and Chakotay is restored as captain of Voyager .

 Some criticism was directed at Chakotay 's character development during the series . James <unk> for the Star Tribune said that " Chakotay , the rock @-@ solid First Officer , remained rock @-@ solid " , but also suggested that " [ a ] ll of the characters ended the series as they began . " 
 Critics commented on the relationship between Janeway and Chakotay , with psychologist Richard <unk> 's views published in The Boston Herald . He suggesting that by several seasons into Voyager , Chakotay had come to terms with his feelings for his Captain , but she was hesitant about entering into a relationship with a member of her crew . For the relationship to work in the future , it was said that Chakotay should not try to lead the relationship and Janeway needed to be more vulnerable . Following the end of Star Trek : Enterprise , the romance between Chakotay and Janeway was described in The Chicago Tribune as the one most wanted to be seen on screen in any of the Star Trek series , but that " it never panned out . Dang ! " Chakotay 's relationship with Seven was also commented on , and both UGO and io9 complained that the relationship appeared at random . 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 Chakotay 's inclusion in the main cast of Voyager was seen by critics as one of several who was used to highlight the diversity within the series . This was highlighted during the episode " Faces " in which one scene showed Janeway , Tuvok , Harry Kim , and Chakotay in a single camera pan . Chakotay 's individual position was that he was " continually positioned as an exotic native other in relation to the white female Captain Janeway " , and was used to " help the white protagonist and progress the internal narrative . " 
 The placement of a character of indigenous peoples descent in science fiction was highlighted in the media . Drew Hayden Taylor said that Chakotay was " [ p ] erhaps the most well @-@ known " . Of Chakotay 's origin , he said , " They never actually say what nation he is , but I do believe it 's some Central American tribe . " Hayden Taylor wrote in a later article in 2012 describing the rise of Native American characters in the Twilight film series that Chakotay was still the sole popular example of a Native American character in science fiction . Chakotay was also described as " the only First Nations role model around in a futuristic setting " in the 2005 book , " Indian " Stereotypes in TV Science Fiction : First Nations ' Voices Speak Out , but was also referred to as the " quintessential Tonto in outer space " . A similar criticism was highlighted of the character in Medicine Bags and Dog Tags : American Indian Veterans from Colonial Times to the Second Iraq War ( 2008 ) , which called Chakotay " a creature of white fantasies " and suggested that he was " far more stereotypical than Tonto " as " at least Tonto was heroic and saved the Lone Ranger once in awhile " . 
 Although religion was referenced during the Star Trek franchise , such as in the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " Who Mourns for Adonais ? " , it did not take a more prominent role until later in the series , with Star Trek : Deep Space Nine exploring the Bajorans ' beliefs and Voyager concentrating on those of Chakotay . These included vision quests , and other interpretation of Native American culture which were described by critics as showing a " very Hollywood version of Plains @-@ culture religion " . 
 The appearance of a medicine wheel in the episode " Cathexis " was described by Sierra S. Adare as showing Chakotay in the " ' good Indian ' in the classic Pocahontas sense " . Chakotay is seen attempting to introduce rituals and meditation techniques to other crew members , something they failed to understand . These were said to be contrary to the tribal history described in " Tattoo " , which was said to say that Chakotay 's tribe descended from a pre @-@ Mayan culture in Central America . Adare attributed this to Euro @-@ American / European writers writing inaccurate information into scripts . However , the appearance of the character was described as " groundbreaking " . 
 = Arthur Bell ( footballer ) = 
 Arthur A. Bell ( November 1882 – 22 April 1923 ) was an English footballer who played as an inside forward . He started his career with Burnley Belvedere before joining Football League side Burnley in 1902 . Over the next seven years , Bell made 101 league appearances and scored 28 goals for the Lancashire club . During his career , he won three caps for the England national amateur football team . An architect by trade , Bell also played as an amateur cricketer for Burnley Cricket Club for 20 years , during which time he won five Lancashire League championships . He was selected to represent the Lancashire Second XI on three occasions . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Bell was born in Burnley , Lancashire , in November 1882 , one of three children born to Thomas and Elizabeth Bell . He was educated at the Burnley Grammar School . An amateur throughout his sporting career , he worked professionally as an architect and would often miss matches due to work commitments . In 1911 , he was involved in the building of the new Brunshaw Road stand at the Turf Moor stadium in Burnley . He died on 22 April 1923 , at the age of 40 . 
 = = Football = = 
 As a youth , Bell played amateur football with Burnley Belvedere before joining Football League Second Division side Burnley in February 1902 . He made his debut for the club on 10 January 1903 in the 1 – 0 win against Lincoln City at Turf Moor ; the winning goal was scored by Cuthbert Storey , who was also playing in his first senior match after transferring from Burnley Belvedere . Bell was selected once more in the 1902 – 03 campaign , playing at left inside forward in the 1 – 3 defeat to Leicester Fosse on 24 January 1903 . He was unable to break into the team for the first five months of the following season due to the form of fellow inside forward William Jackson , a new signing from Barrow . He made his first appearance of the campaign in the goalless draw away at Grimsby Town on 30 January 1904 . Bell scored his first competitive goal for Burnley in the 2 – 0 win over Gainsborough Trinity three weeks later , and on 12 March he scored a late goal in the 1 – 3 loss away to Manchester United . In total , Bell played eleven league matches during the 1903 – 04 season and scored four goals . 
 Bell was selected to play in the opening match of the 1904 – 05 season , a 1 – 4 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion . Bell kept his place in the side for the following match against Chesterfield , but was dropped for the trip to Bolton Wanderers in favour of youngster William Hutchinson , a summer signing from non @-@ League club Alston . He was recalled for the visit of Liverpool on 22 October 1904 , deputising for the unavailable Doug MacFarlane , but then spent more than two months out of the team . Bell made two further appearances for Burnley that season , playing in consecutive defeats to Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool in January 1905 . He found himself more involved in the first @-@ team during the 1905 – 06 campaign , making 19 league appearances . On 13 January 1906 , he played in the first FA Cup game of his career as Burnley were eliminated by Southern League side Tottenham Hotspur in the first round . Bell scored his first goal of the season on 10 February 1906 , netting the opening goal in the 2 – 2 draw against Burslem Port Vale . During March 1906 , he scored in the home wins over Leeds City and Chelsea . 
 After missing the first three matches of the 1906 – 07 season due to cricketing commitments , Bell was chosen to replace McFarlane for the visit of Nottingham Forest on 15 September 1906 . Two weeks later he scored twice in the 4 – 0 home win over Burton United , and went on to score three more goals in his next four appearances , including a late winner away at Leeds City . However , the victory was overshadowed by the news that Leeds forward Soldier Wilson had died after collapsing during the match . Bell went on to score a total of 12 goals in 1906 – 07 , his highest return in a single season . His performances for Burnley led to a call @-@ up from the England amateur team in April 1907 , and he won his first cap in the 8 – 1 defeat of the Netherlands in The Hague . In the match , he played alongside full England internationals Harold Hardman and Vivian Woodward , who , like Bell , was a professional architect . 
 Although he again missed the opening month of the following season , Bell quickly reclaimed his status as one of Burnley 's first @-@ choice players , starting 26 league matches during the campaign . He scored on his first appearance of the season in the 2 – 2 draw away at Derby County , and scored twice in the 5 – 1 win against Grimsby Town on 2 November 1907 . Bell scored the only FA Cup goal of his career in the home tie against Southampton on 11 January 1908 , but could not prevent the Southern League side securing a 2 – 1 victory . He continued to play for Burnley when work and cricket allowed in the 1908 – 09 campaign , making 15 league appearances . He scored twice during the season ; he scored in the 1 – 4 defeat away at Oldham Athletic on 14 November , and scored the winning goal in the 3 – 2 defeat of Barnsley on 5 December . Bell played in 101st and final league game for Burnley in the 0 – 1 loss at Derby County on 26 December 1908 . He retired from football shortly afterwards , stating that playing football in winter in addition to cricket during the summer , combined with managing an architecture practice , was too demanding . 
 = = = Career statistics = = = 
 = = Cricket = = 
 Aside from football , Bell was also an accomplished amateur cricketer ; he assisted Burnley Cricket Club between 1899 and 1919 , and would often choose to play cricket rather than football when the seasons overlapped . He was a member of the side that won the Lancashire League in 1901 and went on to captain the team that won three consecutive titles in 1906 , 1907 and 1908 . Bell won a fifth Lancashire League title with Burnley in the 1913 season . A left @-@ handed batsman , he also bowled slow left arm . Bell represented the Lancashire Second XI on three occasions in 1905 and 1906 . He was selected for two matches against the Surrey and Yorkshire second teams during the 1905 season and on 9 July 1906 he played in the Minor Counties Championship draw with Staffordshire at Turf Moor , entering play as a substitute after Herbert Rhodes was injured while fielding . 
 = Domestic sheep reproduction = 
 As with other mammals , domestic sheep reproduction occurs sexually . Their reproductive strategy is very similar to other domestic herd animals . A flock of sheep is generally mated by a single ram , which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams ( in feral populations ) . Most sheep have a breeding season ( <unk> ) in the autumn , though some are able to breed year @-@ round . 
 Largely as a result of the influence of humans in sheep breeding , ewes often produce multiple lambs . This increase in the lamb births , both in number and birth weight , may cause problems in delivery and lamb survival , requiring the intervention of shepherds . 
 = = Sexual behavior = = 
 Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months of age , and rams generally at four to six ( ram lambs have occasionally been known to impregnate their mothers at two months ) . Ewes enter into estrus cycles about every 17 days , which last for approximately 30 hours . In addition to emitting a scent , they indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams . Sheep may display homosexuality , which occurs in about eight percent of rams . Its occurrence does not seem to be related to flock hierarchy ( as some homosexual behavior is in mammals ) , rather the ram 's typical motor pattern for intercourse is directed at rams instead of ewes . The phenomenon of the <unk> , a female bovine that is behaviorally masculine and lacks functioning ovaries , is commonly associated with cattle , but does occur to some extent in sheep . The instance of freemartins in sheep may be increasing in concert with the rise in twinning ( freemartins are the result of male @-@ female twin combinations ) . 
 = = = Rutting = = = 
 Without human intervention , rams may fight during the rut to determine which individuals may mate with ewes . Rams , especially unfamiliar ones , will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance ; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely . During the rut , even normally friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels . 
 Historically , especially aggressive rams were sometimes blindfolded or hobbled . Today , those who keep rams typically prefer softer preventative measures , such as moving within a clear line to an exit , never turning their back on a ram , and possibly dousing with water or a diluted solution of bleach or vinegar to dissuade charges . 
 = = Pregnancy = = 
 Without ultrasound or other special tools , determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult . Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy about six weeks before giving birth , so shepherds often rely on the assumption that a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock . However , by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness that holds a special crayon ( or <unk> , sometimes spelled <unk> ) , ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color . Dye may also be directly applied to the ram 's brisket . This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important , since the color of a <unk> contaminates it . 
 After mating , sheep have a gestation period of around five months . Within a few days of the impending birth , ewes begin to behave differently . They may lie down and stand erratically , paw the ground , or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns . A ewe 's udder will quickly fill out , and her vulva will swell . Vaginal , uterine or anal prolapse may also occur , in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists . 
 = = = Artificial insemination and embryo transfer = = = 
 In addition to natural insemination by rams , artificial insemination and embryo transfers have been used in sheep breeding programs for many years in Australia and New Zealand . These programs have become more commonplace in the United States during the 2000s as the number of veterinarians qualified to perform these types of procedures with proficiency have grown . However , ovine AI is a relatively complicated procedure compared to other livestock . Unlike cattle or goats , which have straight cervices that can be vaginally inseminated , ewes have a curved cervix which is more difficult to access . Additionally , breeders were until recently unable to control their ewe 's estrus cycles . The ability to control the estrus cycle is much easier today because of products that safely assist in aligning heat cycles . Some examples of products are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> V. These products contain progesterone which will bring on the induction of estrus in ewes ( sheep ) during seasonal anestrus . Seasonal anestrus is when ewes do not have regular estrous cycles outside the natural breeding season . 
 Historically , vaginal insemination of sheep only produced 40 @-@ 60 % success rates , and was thus called a " shot in the dark " ( SID ) . In the 1980s , Australian researchers developed a laparoscopic insemination procedure which , combined with the use of progestogen and pregnant mare 's serum gonadotropin ( <unk> ) , yielded much higher success rates ( 50 @-@ 80 % or more ) , and has become the standard for artificial insemination of sheep in the 21st century . 
 Semen collection is naturally an integral component of this entire process . Once semen has been collected it can be used immediately for insemination or slowly frozen for use at a later date . Fresh semen is recognized as the method of choice as it lives longer and yields higher conception rates . Frozen semen will work but it must be the highest quality of semen and the ewes must be inseminated twice in the same day . The marketing of ram semen is a major part of this industry . Producers owning prize winning rams have found this to be a good avenue to leverage the accolades of their most famous animals . 
 During embryo transfer ( ET ) a minor surgical procedure with almost no risk of injury or infection when performed properly , sheep laparoscopy allows the importation of improved genetics , even of breeds which may otherwise be non @-@ existent in certain countries due to the regulation of live animal imports . Embryo transfer procedures are used to allow producers to maximize those females that produce the best lambs / kids either for retention into the flock or for sale to other producers . ET also allows producers to continue to utilize a ewe / doe that may not physically be able to carry or feed a set of lambs . ET can allow a producer to grow his flock quickly with above average individuals of similar bloodlines . The primary industry to utilize this technology in the United States is the club lamb breeders and exhibitors . It is a common practice in the commercial sheep industries of Australia , New Zealand , and South America . 
 Average success rates in Embryo Transfer in terms of embryos recovered can vary widely . Each breed will respond differently to the ET process . Typically white faced ewes and does are more fertile than black faced ewes . A range of zero to the mid 20 ’ s in terms of viable embryos recovered from a flush procedure can be expected . Over the course of a year the average is 6 @.@ 8 <unk> eggs per donor with a 75 % conception rate for those eggs . 
 A big part of modern sheep reproduction is overall breeding animal health . In an effort to help improve animal health and ultimately performance many progressive breeders rely on <unk> . Evidence based research substantiated by reliable field trials have shown improved performance in sheep . The name comes from the progenitor cells of the body . The progenitor cells are differentiated stem cells with specific direction and purpose to become the future building blocks of the body . The goal for <unk> is to support the body at the most fundamental levels encouraging efficient development of the progenitor cells . This approach is to impact the entire animal starting with immune function , gastrointestinal health , vascular system , and importantly reproduction efficiency . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 When birth is imminent , contractions begin to take place , and the fitful behavior of the ewe may increase . A normal labor may take one to several hours , depending on how many lambs are present , the age of the ewe , and her physical and nutritional condition prior to the birth . Though some breeds may regularly produce larger litters of lambs ( records stand around nine lambs at once ) , most produce either single or twin lambs . At some point , usually at the beginning of labor or soon after the births have occurred , ewes and lambs may be confined to small lambing jugs . These pens , which are generally two to eight feet ( 0 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 4 m ) in length and width , are designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs . 
 Ovine obstetrics can be problematic . By selectively breeding ewes that produce multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations , sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing . However , it is a myth that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance ; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without <unk> this can be proven by the fact that they give birth in the wild . Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding . While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention , many complications may arise . A lamb may present in the normal fashion ( with both legs and head forward ) , but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal . This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes ( this is related to breed , rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison ) . Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side , completely backward , or with only some of their limbs protruding . Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn . Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease . Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections . 
 In the case of any such problems , those present at lambing ( who may or may not include a veterinarian , most shepherds become accomplished at lambing to some degree ) may assist the ewe in extracting or repositioning lambs . After the birth , ewes ideally break the amniotic sac ( if it is not broken during labor ) , and begin licking clean the lamb . The licking clears the nose and mouth , dries the lamb , and stimulates it . Lambs that are breathing and healthy at this point begin trying to stand , and ideally do so between a half and full hour , with help from the mother . Generally after lambs stand , the umbilical cord is trimmed to about an inch ( 2 @.@ 5 centimeters ) . Once trimmed , a small container ( such as a film canister ) of iodine is held against the lamb 's belly over the remainder of the cord to prevent infection . 
 = = <unk> care = = 
 In normal situations , lambs nurse after standing , receiving vital colostrum milk . Lambs that either fail to nurse or are prevented from doing so by the ewe require aid in order to live . If coaxing the pair to accept nursing does not work , one of several steps may then be taken . Ewes may be held or tied to force them to accept a nursing lamb . If a lamb is not eating , a stomach tube may also be used to force feed the lamb in order to save its life . In the case of a permanently rejected lamb , a shepherd may then attempt to foster an orphaned lamb onto another ewe . Lambs are also sometimes fostered after the death of their mother , either from the birth or other event . 
 Scent plays a large factor in ewes recognizing their lambs , so disrupting the scent of a newborn lamb with washing or over @-@ handling may cause a ewe to reject it . Conversely , various methods of imparting the scent of a ewe 's own lamb to an orphaned one may be useful in fostering . If an orphaned lamb cannot be fostered , then it usually becomes what is known as a bottle lamb — a lamb raised by people and fed via bottle . 
 After lambs are stabilized , lamb marking is carried out – this includes ear tagging , docking , castration and usually vaccination . Ear tags with numbers are the primary mode of identification when sheep are not named ; it is also the legal manner of animal identification in the European Union : the number may identify the individual sheep or only its flock . When performed at an early age , ear tagging seems to cause little or no discomfort to lambs . However , using tags improperly or using tags not designed for sheep may cause discomfort , largely due to excess weight of tags for other animals . 
 Ram lambs not intended for breeding are castrated , though some shepherds choose to avoid the procedure for ethical , economic or practical reasons . Ram lambs that will be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated . In most breeds , lambs ' tails are docked for health reasons . The tail may be removed just below the lamb 's caudal tail flaps ( docking shorter than this may cause health problems such as rectal prolapse ) , but in some breeds the tail is left longer , or is not docked at all . Docking is not necessary in short @-@ tailed breeds , and it is not usually done in breeds in which a long tail is valued , such as <unk> . Though docking is often considered cruel and unnatural by animal rights activists , it is considered by sheep producers large and small alike to be a critical step in maintaining the health of sheep . Long , wooly tails make shearing more difficult , interfere with mating , and make sheep extremely susceptible to parasites , especially those that cause flystrike . Both castration and docking can be performed with several instruments . An elastrator places a tight band of rubber around an area , causing it to atrophy and fall off in a number of weeks . This process is bloodless and does not seem to cause extended suffering to lambs , who tend to ignore it after several hours . In addition to the elastrator , a <unk> , <unk> , heated chisel or knife are sometimes used . After one to three days in the lambing jugs , ewes and lambs are usually sufficiently stabilized to allow reintroduction to the rest of the flock . 
 = = Commercial sheep breeding = = 
 In the large sheep producing nations of South America , Australia and New Zealand sheep are usually bred on large tracts of land with much less intervention from the graziers or breeders . Merinos , and much of the land in these countries does not lend itself to the mob intervention that is found in smaller flock breeding countries . In these countries there is little need , and no option but for ewes to lamb outdoors as there are insufficient structures to handle the large flocks of ewes there . New Zealand ewes produce 36 million lambs each spring time , which is an average of 2 @,@ 250 lambs per farm . Australian graziers , too , do not receive the financial support that governments in other countries provide to sheep breeders . Low @-@ cost sheep breeding is based on large numbers of sheep per labour unit and having ewes that are capable of unsupervised lambing to produce hardy , active lambs . 
 = = Managerial aspects = = 
 For breeders intent on strict improvements to their flocks , ewes are classed and inferior sheep are removed prior to mating in order to maintain or improve the quality of the flock . <unk> ( wooly ) faces have long been associated with lower fertility rates . Stud or specially selected rams are chosen with aid of objective measurements , genetic information and evaluation services that are now available in Australia and New Zealand . The choice of mating time is governed by many factors including climate , market requirements and feed availability . Rams are typically mated at about 2 @.@ 5 % depending on the age of the sheep , plus consideration as to the size and type of mating paddocks . The mating period ranges from about 6 to 8 weeks in commercial flocks . Longer mating times result in management problems with lamb marking and shearing etc . 
 Good nutrition is vital to ewes during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy in order to prevent pregnancy toxaemia , especially in twin bearing ewes . <unk> , however , may result in over large single lambs and dystocia . Shearing ewes before lambing reduces the number of ewes that are cast ( i.e. unable to rise unassisted ) , and the number of lambs and ewes that are lost . Lambs , too , are aided in finding the udder and suckling a shorn ewe . 
 After shearing ewes are typically placed in well sheltered paddocks that have good feed and water . Attention to ewes that are lambing varies according to the breed , size and locations of properties . Unless they are stud ewes it unlikely that they will receive intensive care . On stations with large paddocks there is a policy of non @-@ interference . On other properties the mobs are inspected by stockmen at varying intervals to stand cast ewes and deal with dystocia . Producers also sometimes quietly drift pregnant ewes away from ewes that have already <unk> , in order to prevent mis @-@ mothering . 
 Lambs are usually marked at three to six weeks of age , but a protracted lambing season may necessitate two markings . 
 = = = Inbreeding depression = = = 
 Inbreeding tends to occur in flocks of limited size and where only a single or a few rams are used . Associated with inbreeding is a decline in progeny performance usually referred to as inbreeding depression . Inbreeding depression has been found for lamb <unk> , average daily weight gain from birth until two months , and litter size . 
 = = Other countries = = 
 In the major sheep countries of Argentina , Uruguay , Brazil , Peru and Chile , breeders are also utilizing fleece testing and performance recording schemes as a means of improving their flocks . 
 = = New research = = 
 In 2008 , for the first time in history , researchers at Chiswick CSIRO research station , between <unk> and Armidale , New South Wales have used stem cells to develop surrogate rams and bulls . These males then produce the viable semen of another male . 
 The approach in these sheep experiments involves irradiating a ram ’ s testes while placing stem cells from a second ram into the testes of the first , ram A. In the following weeks ram A produces semen the usual way , but is using the stem cells of ram B and therefore producing semen carrying the genetics of ram B rather than those of his own . Ram A therefore has effectively become a surrogate ram . 
 The viable semen is then implanted in the ewe and the many lambs born through this process are proving to be normal and healthy . DNA tests have proved that up to 10 % of the lambs are sired by the surrogate ram and carry the genetics of the donor ram . 
 = Mortal Folly / Mortal Recoil = 
 " Mortal Folly " and " Mortal Recoil " are the twenty @-@ fourth and twenty @-@ fifth episodes of the second season of the American animated television series Adventure Time . " Mortal Folly " was written and storyboarded by Adam Muto and Rebecca Sugar , whereas " Mortal Recoil " was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Cole Sanchez . Both were based on a story by Mark Banker , Kent Osborne , Patrick McHale , and series creator Pendleton Ward . The two episodes originally aired on Cartoon Network on May 2 , 2011 , and guest starred Ron Perlman as the Lich , and Isabella Acres as young Princess Bubblegum . Perlman 's character would become the series ' chief antagonist , and would reappear in several fourth and fifth season episodes . 
 The series follows the adventures of Finn ( voiced by Jeremy Shada ) , a human boy , and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake ( voiced by John DiMaggio ) , a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will . In " Mortal Folly " , Finn and Jake must go on a quest to find the Lich ( voiced by Perlman ) , while the Ice King ( voiced by Tom Kenny ) pesters them for their blessing to marry Princess Bubblegum ( voiced by Hynden Walch ) . After seemingly defeating the Lich , however , the Ice King accidentally drops Bubblegum into the Lich 's well of power . In " Mortal Recoil " , Princess Bubblegum possessed by the spirit of the Lich , and Finn and Jake team up with the Ice King to stop him . After Bubblegum is seriously wounded and there is not enough candy bio @-@ mass to save her , she reverts to a 13 @-@ year @-@ old . 
 " Mortal Folly " and " Mortal Recoil " marked the first time that one Adventure Time episode carried the plot into another episode . The plot was concluded with " Mortal Recoil " which aired on the same day . The episode introduced the Lich , who had first been proposed in the series ' pitch bible . Both episodes were supposed to air as the second season finale , but due to a studio mix @-@ up , they were aired as the penultimate episode , before " Heat Signature " . Despite this , they are still considered by Ward to function as the season two finale . Both episodes were watched by 1 @.@ 92 million people and received largely positive critical attention ; many critics enjoyed the way the episode began to set up the series ' mythology .

 While meditating with Finn and Jake , Princess Bubblegum has a premonition involving the Lich , an evil undead sorcerer who was long ago trapped in a block of amber by the legendary hero Billy . Bubblegum tells Finn and Jake about the dream , and the three of them journey to the tree at the top of Bubblegum 's palace where the block of amber is hidden ; Bubblegum also places magical jewels on Finn and Jake 's heads that will prevent the Lich from exerting mind @-@ control on them . While examining the amber , a snail is placed under the Lich 's spell and helps break him out while Finn and Jake are not paying attention . The Lich then blasts out of the kingdom , leaving a wave of destruction in his path . 
 Finn and Jake , after acquiring the legendary gauntlet of Billy as well as a special pink sweater made by Bubblegum , give chase , but they are consistently interrupted by the Ice King , who keeps trying to get Finn and Jake 's blessings to marry Bubblegum . Fed up with their dismissive attitude , the Ice King kidnaps Bubblegum and follows Finn and Jake as the two heroes pursue the Lich . The Lich eventually reaches his lair , an abandoned subway station , and creates a pool of green liquid which he plans to use to regain his strength and destroy the world . 
 Finn , Jake , the Ice King , and Bubblegum follow the Lich into his lair . In the entanglement that follows , Billy 's gauntlet is destroyed by the Lich and Finn breaks his jewel . The Lich attempts to exert mind @-@ control on Finn , but Finn is able to resist . It is then revealed that the sweater Bubblegum gave to Finn has the power to repel the Lich due to it being imbued with " liking someone a lot " . Finn then takes the sweater and pushes it into the Lich 's eye sockets and rips his face apart , seemingly killing him . However , the Ice King accidentally drops Bubblegum into the Lich 's evil vat , to the horror of Finn and Jake .

 After Princess Bubblegum falls into the Lich 's well of power , she is rushed to the Candy Kingdom hospital and saved . However , the Ice King feels that something is awry and tries to warn Finn , but Finn angrily scolds him and tells him to leave the kingdom . Finn and Jake then focus their energy on taking care of Princess Bubblegum , whose behavior seems off . At first , she claims that she needs some rest , but soon she begins acting strangely , such as convulsing in her bed . Finn leaves to acquire items that Bubblegum requests — which includes weapons @-@ grade plutonium , ammonium , and gasoline among other items — and Jake tries to cheer Bubblegum up with a song . 
 This , however , back @-@ fires and Bubblegum ignites her bedroom with some sort of dark magic . It is apparent that Bubblegum has been possessed by the spirit of the Lich . Finn returns , and the two discover Bubblegum mixing the ingredients that Finn retrieved in her bathtub and then drinking it . She soon deforms and turns into a grotesque monster ; she hurls Finn and Jake through a wall and the two discover the Ice King . He finally tells them that he saw with his " wizard eyes " the spirit of the Lich descend into Bubblegum after she fell into the well of power . The three make an unlikely alliance , teaming up to beat the Lich @-@ possessed Bubblegum . 
 While Finn distracts her , the Ice King uses his ice powers to freeze Bubblegum . Their moment of success , however , is cut short when the still @-@ frozen Bubblegum tips over and shatters everywhere . Her body parts are again rushed to the hospital where she is reassembled . However , there are not enough pieces to complete her , and so she ends up reverting to a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl . Finn , who is also 13 , is excited , but the Ice King temporarily gives up his pursuit of Bubblegum due to her age . As the episode ends , it is revealed that the Lich has once again possessed the body of the snail , who angrily waves goodbye to the camera .

 Both " Mortal Folly " and " Mortal Recoil " were directed by Larry Leichliter . The first half was written and storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Adam Muto , whereas the second half was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Cole Sanchez . Both were based on a story by Mark Banker , Kent Osborne , Patrick McHale , and series creator Pendleton Ward . In the original outline for " Mortal Folly " , the Lich had several lines that played him off as a stereotypical villain . Sugar and Muto decided to make him into a more " scary and dangerous " character , and purposely played up the darker elements of the episode . In addition , Princess Bubblegum 's sweater was supposed to be " magic " and " shoot lasers " . However , Sugar felt that it would be more emotionally poignant if the sweater was just a regular sweater imbued with positive emotions . The scene featuring Finn stuffing the sweater into the Lich 's eye sockets and then ripping his skull apart was inspired by an artistic design idea Sugar had had when she was in high school ; she had wanted to draw a comic featuring a small person getting into a fight and being pushed up to the ceiling . 
 " Mortal Folly " and " Mortal Recoil " feature the first substantial appearance of the Lich , the series ' primary antagonist . The Lich had appeared in concept drawings in the series ' pitch bible , which Ward himself had created in 2007 . Ward 's original drawing was re @-@ designed by former creative director McHale ; he purposely gave the Lich a desiccated and dried @-@ up look , and was instrumental in crafting the Lich 's rotting appearance . In both this episode and other episodes where the character appears , the Lich was voiced by Ron Perlman . The snail , an easter egg that appears in every episode , appears in the episodes and plays a prominent part . Originally , the snail was inspired by the in @-@ jokes in episodes of The Simpsons , and was Ward 's attempt to " make a game out of every episode of Adventure Time , where you could freeze @-@ frame and find things in the background " , such as the snail . However , in " Mortal Folly " , the snail serves as the catalyst for the Lich 's escape . The snail would also play an important part in other mythology @-@ heavy episodes like " In Your Footsteps " , and " The Lich " . Osborne later noted that the snail 's appearance was pleasing to fans who knew that the snail had been appearing in all the episodes and had actively searched for it before . 
 In the original storyboard , the Lich 's lair was not specifically designed to be a subway . This was added later by the background designers . The undead skeletons that attack Finn and Jake were originally supposed to be " specific undead from [ Dungeons & Dragons ] " . However , Ward changed his mind and tasked Andy Ristaino , a character designer for the series , with designing the corpses . Ristaino <unk> to make them look as if they were " east coast commuters [ all ] bundled up for winter . " He strove to make them look " specific " so that they would appear as people you might see on a subway , such as a bike messenger , a couple , man in a " goofy hat " , and a man wearing a suit . Originally , when the Lich set off his bomb , the storyboard featured a simple mushroom cloud . Ian Jones @-@ Quartey , one of the series ' storyboard revisionists , however , added a face to the blast . Ristaino then added skulls to the smoke . The series staff liked this version so much that they later included it on the title card . 
 Because a large amount of the action in " Mortal Recoil " takes place in Bubblegum 's bedroom , Moynihan was worried that the scenes would not carry interest and " people would get bored " . As such , Moynihan and Sanchez created the scenes " trying to be simultaneously funny and terrifying " . Ward noted that he liked to be " laughing and freaked out " , and that the scenes work in this manner . Former storyboard artist Adam Muto commented that the possession scenes turned out " nice and off @-@ putting " . Jones @-@ Quartey called the shot of a possessed Princess Bubblegum melting " terrifying " . Although the series tries to avoid " cartoon physics " , Sanchez and Moynihan were forced to work around this during the scene when Bubblegum throws Finn and Jake through a wall without harming them . Moynihan later rationalized that the wall was made of candy , and thus was harmless . 
 The end of " Mortal Recoil " introduced the plot thread of Bubblegum de @-@ aging to a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl . This would be expanded upon and eventually resolved in the third season episode " Too Young " . The younger version of Bubblegum was voiced by Isabella Acres , who would reprise her role in " Too Young " . According to Moynihan , there were initially " rumors " to keep Bubblegum young for several episodes , but eventually her 13 @-@ year @-@ old version was relegated to only two appearances before she reverted to normal .

 " Mortal Folly " and " Mortal Recoil " first aired on Cartoon Network on May 2 , 2011 . Both episodes were viewed by 1 @.@ 92 million viewers and scored a Nielsen rating of 1 @.@ 3 / 2 percent . This means it was seen by 1 @.@ 3 percent of all households and 2 percent of all households watching television at the time of the episode 's airing . The episodes first saw physical release as part of the 2012 Adventure Time : Jake vs. Me @-@ Mow DVD , which included 16 episodes from the series ' first three seasons . It was later re @-@ released as part of the complete second season DVD in June 2013 . The season was originally supposed to end with " Mortal Folly " / " Mortal Recoil " , but due to a scheduling conflict , " Heat Signature " was the last episode of the second season aired . Despite this , Ward still considers the two @-@ parter to be the real season finale , and the two entries are the last episodes featured on the second season DVD release . 
 Tyler Foster of DVD Talk praised both " Mortal Folly " and " Mortal Recoil " , noting that , despite the fact that the episodes represented only " the beginning of the show 's journey into direct serialization " , the story @-@ arc was nonetheless " a tantalizing taste of what 's to come . " Wired magazine noted it as one of the stand @-@ outs from the Jake vs. Me @-@ Mow DVD , calling it a " three @-@ part suite " , which concluded with the third season episode " Too Young " . The review enjoyed the way the episode set the stage for the apparent death , resurrection , and de @-@ aging for Princess Bubblegum , which became a major plot point in the next season . Matt Fowler of IGN praised both " Mortal Folly " and " Mortal Recoil " , specifically giving applause to the introduction of the Lich , noting that he is " a real , grotesque villain inserted into the merely semi @-@ dark world of Adventure Time " . Fowler ended up being very happy with the two episodes , writing that they end the season " strong " . 
 = Mathematics and architecture = 
 Mathematics and architecture are related , since , as with other arts , architects use mathematics for several reasons . Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering buildings , architects use geometry : to define the spatial form of a building ; from the Pythagoreans of the sixth century BC onwards , to create forms considered harmonious , and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical , aesthetic and sometimes religious principles ; to decorate buildings with mathematical objects such as tessellations ; and to meet environmental goals , such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings . 
 In Ancient Egypt , Ancient Greece , India , and the Islamic world , buildings including pyramids , temples , mosques , palaces and mausoleums were laid out with specific proportions for religious reasons . In Islamic architecture , geometric shapes and geometric tiling patterns are used to decorate buildings , both inside and outside . Some Hindu temples have a fractal @-@ like structure where parts resemble the whole , conveying a message about the infinite in Hindu cosmology . In the twenty @-@ first century , mathematical ornamentation is again being used to cover public buildings . 
 In Renaissance architecture , symmetry and proportion were deliberately emphasized by architects such as Leon Battista Alberti , Sebastiano Serlio and Andrea Palladio , influenced by Vitruvius 's De architectura from Ancient Rome and the arithmetic of the Pythagoreans from Ancient Greece . At the end of the nineteenth century , Vladimir Shukhov in Russia and Antoni Gaudí in Barcelona pioneered the use of hyperboloid structures ; in the Sagrada Família , Gaudí also incorporated hyperbolic paraboloids , tessellations , catenary arches , <unk> , helicoids , and ruled surfaces . In the twentieth century , styles such as modern architecture and Deconstructivism explored different geometries to achieve desired effects . Minimal surfaces have been exploited in tent @-@ like roof coverings as at Denver International Airport , while Richard Buckminster Fuller pioneered the use of the strong thin @-@ shell structures known as geodesic domes . 
 = = Connected fields = = 
 The architects Michael Ostwald and Kim Williams , considering the relationships between architecture and mathematics , note that the fields as commonly understood might seem to be only weakly connected , since architecture is a profession concerned with the practical matter of making buildings , while mathematics is the pure study of number and other abstract objects . But , they argue , the two are strongly connected , and have been since antiquity . In Ancient Rome , Vitruvius described an architect as a man who knew enough of a range of other disciplines , primarily geometry , to enable him to oversee skilled artisans in all the other necessary areas , such as masons and carpenters . The same applied in the Middle Ages , where graduates learnt arithmetic , geometry and aesthetics alongside the basic syllabus of grammar , logic , and rhetoric ( the trivium ) in elegant halls made by master builders who had guided many craftsmen . A master builder at the top of his profession was given the title of architect or engineer . In the Renaissance , the quadrivium of arithmetic , geometry , music and astronomy became an extra syllabus expected of the Renaissance man such as Leon Battista Alberti . Similarly in England , Sir Christopher Wren , known today as an architect , was firstly a noted astronomer . 
 Williams and Ostwald , further overviewing the interaction of mathematics and architecture since 1500 according to the approach of the German sociologist Theodor Adorno , identify three tendencies among architects , namely : to be revolutionary , introducing wholly new ideas ; reactionary , failing to introduce change ; or revivalist , actually going backwards . They argue that architects have avoided looking to mathematics for inspiration in revivalist times . This would explain why in revivalist periods , such as the Gothic Revival in 19th century England , architecture had little connection to mathematics . Equally , they note that in reactionary times such as the Italian Mannerism of about 1520 to 1580 , or the 17th century Baroque and Palladian movements , mathematics was barely consulted . In contrast , the revolutionary early 20th century movements such as Futurism and Constructivism actively rejected old ideas , embracing mathematics and leading to Modernist architecture . Towards the end of the 20th century , too , fractal geometry was quickly seized upon by architects , as was aperiodic tiling , to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings . 
 Architects use mathematics for several reasons , leaving aside the necessary use of mathematics in the engineering of buildings . Firstly , they use geometry because it defines the spatial form of a building . Secondly , they use mathematics to design forms that are considered beautiful or harmonious . From the time of the Pythagoreans with their religious philosophy of number , architects in Ancient Greece , Ancient Rome , the Islamic world and the Italian Renaissance have chosen the proportions of the built environment – buildings and their designed surroundings – according to mathematical as well as aesthetic and sometimes religious principles . Thirdly , they may use mathematical objects such as tessellations to decorate buildings . Fourthly , they may use mathematics in the form of computer modelling to meet environmental goals , such as to minimise whirling air currents at the base of tall buildings .

 = = = = Ancient Rome = = = = 
 = = = = = Vitruvius = = = = = 
 The influential Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius argued that the design of a building such as a temple depends on two qualities , proportion and symmetria . Proportion ensures that each part of a building relates harmoniously to every other part . <unk> in Vitruvius 's usage means something closer to the English term modularity than mirror symmetry , as again it relates to the assembling of ( modular ) parts into the whole building . In his Basilica at Fano , he uses ratios of small integers , especially the triangular numbers ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 10 , ... ) to proportion the structure into ( Vitruvian ) modules . Thus the Basilica 's width to length is 1 : 2 ; the aisle around it is as high as it is wide , 1 : 1 ; the columns are five feet thick and fifty feet high , 1 : 10 . 
 Vitruvius named three qualities required of architecture in his De architectura , c . 15 B.C. : firmness , usefulness ( or " Commodity " in Henry Wotton 's 16th century English ) , and delight . These can be used as categories for classifying the ways in which mathematics is used in architecture . <unk> encompasses the use of mathematics to ensure a building stands up , hence the mathematical tools used in design and to support construction , for instance to ensure stability and to model performance . <unk> derives in part from the effective application of mathematics , reasoning about and analysing the spatial and other relationships in a design . Delight is an attribute of the resulting building , resulting from the embodying of mathematical relationships in the building ; it includes aesthetic , sensual and intellectual qualities . 
 = = = = = The Pantheon = = = = = 
 The Pantheon in Rome has survived intact , illustrating classical Roman structure , proportion , and decoration . The main structure is a dome , the apex left open as a circular oculus to let in light ; it is fronted by a short colonnade with a triangular pediment . The height to the oculus and the diameter of the interior circle are the same , 43 @.@ 3 metres ( 142 ft ) , so the whole interior would fit exactly within a cube , and the interior could house a sphere of the same diameter . These dimensions make more sense when expressed in ancient Roman units of measurement : The dome spans 150 Roman feet ) ; the oculus is 30 Roman feet in diameter ; the doorway is 40 Roman feet high . The Pantheon remains the world 's largest unreinforced concrete dome . 
 = = = = Renaissance = = = = 
 The first Renaissance treatise on architecture was Leon Battista Alberti 's 1450 De re <unk> ( On the Art of Building ) ; it became the first printed book on architecture in 1485 . It was partly based on Vitruvius 's De architectura and , via <unk> , Pythagorean arithmetic . Alberti starts with a cube , and derives ratios from it . Thus the diagonal of a face gives the ratio 1 : √ 2 , while the diameter of the sphere which circumscribes the cube gives 1 : √ 3 . Alberti also documented Filippo Brunelleschi 's discovery of linear perspective , developed to enable the design of buildings which would look beautifully proportioned when viewed from a convenient distance . 
 The next major text was Sebastiano Serlio 's Regole <unk> d 'architettura ( General Rules of Architecture ) ; the first volume appeared in Venice in 1537 ; the 1545 volume ( books 1 and 2 ) covered geometry and perspective . Two of Serlio 's methods for constructing perspectives were wrong , but this did not stop his work being widely used . 
 In 1570 , Andrea Palladio published the influential I quattro libri dell 'architettura ( The Four Books of Architecture ) in Venice . This widely printed book was largely responsible for spreading the ideas of the Italian Renaissance throughout Europe , assisted by proponents like the English diplomat Henry Wotton with his 1624 The Elements of Architecture . The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3 : 4 and 4 : 5 , and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios . Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade ; however , Palladio 's designs related to the whole , usually square , villa . Palladio permitted a range of ratios in the Quattro libri , stating : 
 There are seven types of room that are the most beautiful and well proportioned and turn out better : they can be made circular , though these are rare ; or square ; or their length will equal the diagonal of the square of the breadth ; or a square and a third ; or a square and a half ; or a square and two @-@ thirds ; or two squares . 
 In 1615 , Vincenzo Scamozzi published the late Renaissance treatise L <unk> dell 'Architettura <unk> ( The Idea of a Universal Architecture ) . He attempted to relate the design of cities and buildings to the ideas of Vitruvius and the Pythagoreans , and to the more recent ideas of Palladio .

 <unk> structures were used starting towards the end of the nineteenth century by Vladimir Shukhov for masts , lighthouses and cooling towers . Their striking shape is both aesthetically interesting and strong , using structural materials economically . Shukhov 's first <unk> tower was exhibited in Nizhny Novgorod in 1896 .

 The early twentieth century movement Modern Architecture , pioneered by Russian Constructivism , used rectilinear Euclidean ( also called Cartesian ) geometry . In the De Stijl movement , the horizontal and the vertical were seen as constituting the universal . The architectural form consists of putting these two directional tendencies together , using roof planes , wall planes and balconies , which either slide past or intersect each other , as in the 1924 Rietveld Schröder House by Gerrit Rietveld . 
 Modernist architects were free to make use of curves as well as planes . Charles Holden 's 1933 Arnos station has a circular ticket hall in brick with a flat concrete roof . In 1938 , the Bauhaus painter Laszlo Moholy @-@ Nagy adopted Raoul Heinrich <unk> 's seven <unk> elements , namely the crystal , the sphere , the cone , the plane , the ( cuboidal ) strip , the ( cylindrical ) rod , and the spiral , as the supposed basic building blocks of architecture inspired by nature . 
 Le Corbusier proposed an anthropometric scale of proportions in architecture , the <unk> , based on the supposed height of a man . Le Corbusier 's 1955 Chapelle Notre Dame du Haut uses free @-@ form curves not describable in mathematical formulae . The shapes are said to be evocative of natural forms such as the prow of a ship or praying hands . The design is only at the largest scale : there is no hierarchy of detail at smaller scales , and thus no fractal dimension ; the same applies to other famous twentieth @-@ century buildings such as the Sydney Opera House , Denver International Airport , and the Guggenheim Museum , Bilbao . 
 Contemporary architecture , in the opinion of the 90 leading architects who responded to a 2010 World Architecture Survey , is extremely diverse ; the best was judged to be Frank Gehry 's Guggenheim Museum , Bilbao . 
 Denver International Airport 's terminal building , completed in 1995 , has a fabric roof supported as a minimal surface ( i.e. , its mean curvature is zero ) by steel cables . It evokes Colorado 's snow @-@ capped mountains and the teepee tents of Native Americans . 
 The architect Richard Buckminster Fuller is famous for designing strong thin @-@ shell structures known as geodesic domes . The Montréal <unk> dome is 61 metres ( 200 ft ) high ; its diameter is 76 metres ( 249 ft ) . 
 Sydney Opera House has a dramatic roof consisting of soaring white vaults , reminiscent of ship 's sails ; to make them possible to construct using standardized components , the vaults are all composed of triangular sections of spherical shells with the same radius . These have the required uniform curvature in every direction . 
 The late twentieth century movement Deconstructivism creates deliberate disorder with what Nikos Salingaros in A Theory of Architecture calls random forms of high complexity by using non @-@ parallel walls , superimposed grids and complex 2 @-@ D surfaces , as in Frank Gehry 's Disney Concert Hall and Guggenheim Museum , Bilbao . Until the twentieth century , architecture students were obliged to have a grounding in mathematics . Salingaros argues that first " overly simplistic , politically @-@ driven " Modernism and then " anti @-@ scientific " Deconstructivism have effectively separated architecture from mathematics . He believes that this " reversal of mathematical values " is harmful , as the " pervasive aesthetic " of non @-@ mathematical architecture trains people " to reject mathematical information in the built environment " ; he argues that this has negative effects on society .

 = = = = Ancient Egypt = = = = 
 The pyramids of Ancient Egypt are tombs constructed with deliberately chosen proportions , but which these were has been debated . The face angle is about 51 ° 85 ’ , and the ratio of the slant height to half the base length is 1 @.@ 619 , less than 1 % from the golden ratio . If this was the design method , it would imply the use of Kepler 's triangle ( face angle 51 ° 49 ’ ) . However it is more likely that the pyramids ' slope was chosen from the 3 @-@ 4 @-@ 5 triangle ( face angle 53 ° 8 ’ ) , known from the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus ( c . 1650 – 1550 BC ) ; or from the triangle with base to hypotenuse ratio 1 : 4 / π ( face angle 51 ° 50 ’ ) . 
 The possible use of the 3 @-@ 4 @-@ 5 triangle to lay out right angles , such as for the ground plan of a pyramid , and the knowledge of Pythagoras theorem which that would imply , has been much asserted . It was first conjectured by the historian Moritz Cantor in 1882 . It is known that right angles were laid out accurately in Ancient Egypt ; that their surveyors did use ropes for measurement ; that Plutarch recorded in Isis and Osiris ( around 100 AD ) that the Egyptians admired the 3 @-@ 4 @-@ 5 triangle ; and that the Berlin Papyrus <unk> from the Middle Kingdom ( before 1700 BC ) stated that " the area of a square of 100 is equal to that of two smaller squares . The side of one is ½ + ¼ the side of the other . " The historian of mathematics Roger L. Cooke observes that " It is hard to imagine anyone being interested in such conditions without knowing the Pythagorean theorem . " Against this , Cooke notes that no Egyptian text before 300 BC actually mentions the use of the theorem to find the length of a triangle 's sides , and that there are simpler ways to construct a right angle . Cooke concludes that Cantor 's conjecture remains uncertain : he guesses that the Ancient Egyptians probably did know the Pythagorean theorem , but that " there is no evidence that they used it to construct right angles " . 
 = = = = Ancient India = = = = 
 <unk> Shastra , the ancient Indian canons of architecture and town planning , employs symmetrical drawings called mandalas . Complex calculations are used to arrive at the dimensions of a building and its components . The designs are intended to integrate architecture with nature , the relative functions of various parts of the structure , and ancient beliefs utilizing geometric patterns ( yantra ) , symmetry and directional alignments . However , early builders may have come upon mathematical proportions by accident . The mathematician Georges <unk> notes that simple " tricks " with string and stakes can be used to lay out geometric shapes , such as ellipses and right angles . 
 The mathematics of fractals has been used to show that the reason why existing buildings have universal appeal and are visually satisfying is because they provide the viewer with a sense of scale at different viewing distances . For example , in Hindu temples such as the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi built in the seventh century , and others such as the Kandariya Mahadev Temple at Khajuraho , the parts and the whole have the same character , with fractal dimension in the range 1 @.@ 7 to 1 @.@ 8 . The cluster of smaller towers ( shikhara , lit . ' mountain ' ) about the tallest , central , tower which represents the holy Mount Kailash , abode of Lord Shiva , depicts the endless repetition of universes in Hindu cosmology . The religious studies scholar William J. Jackson observed of the pattern of towers grouped among smaller towers , themselves grouped among still smaller towers , that : 
 The ideal form gracefully <unk> suggests the infinite rising levels of existence and consciousness , expanding sizes rising toward transcendence above , and at the same time housing the sacred deep within . 
 The Meenakshi Amman Temple is a large complex with multiple shrines , with the streets of Madurai laid out concentrically around it according to the shastras . The four gateways are tall towers ( gopurams ) with fractal @-@ like repetitive structure as at Hampi . The enclosures around each shrine are rectangular and surrounded by high stone walls . 
 = = = = Ancient Greece = = = = 
 Pythagoras ( c . 569 – c . 475 B.C. ) and his followers , the Pythagoreans , held that " all things are numbers " . They observed the harmonies produced by notes with specific small @-@ integer ratios of frequency , and argued that buildings too should be designed with such ratios . The Greek word symmetria originally denoted the harmony of architectural shapes in precise ratios from a building 's smallest details right up to its entire design . 
 The Parthenon is 69 @.@ 5 metres ( 228 ft ) long , 30 @.@ 9 metres ( 101 ft ) wide and 13 @.@ 7 metres ( 45 ft ) high to the cornice . This gives a ratio of width to length of 4 : 9 , and the same for height to width . Putting these together gives height : width : length of 16 : 36 : 81 , or to the delight of the Pythagoreans 42 : 62 : 92 . This sets the module as 0 @.@ 858 m . A 4 : 9 rectangle can be constructed as three contiguous rectangles with sides in the ratio 3 : 4 . Each half @-@ rectangle is then a convenient 3 : 4 : 5 right triangle , enabling the angles and sides to be checked with a suitably knotted rope . The inner area ( naos ) similarly has 4 : 9 proportions ( 21 @.@ 44 metres ( 70 @.@ 3 ft ) wide by 48 @.@ 3 m long ) ; the ratio between the diameter of the outer columns , 1 @.@ 905 metres ( 6 @.@ 25 ft ) , and the spacing of their centres , 4 @.@ 293 metres ( 14 @.@ 08 ft ) , is also 4 : 9 . 
 The Parthenon is considered by authors such as John Julius Norwich " the most perfect Doric temple ever built " . Its elaborate architectural refinements include " a subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate , the taper of the naos walls and the <unk> of the columns " . <unk> refers to the subtle diminution in diameter of the columns as they rise . The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand . As in other classical Greek temples , the platform has a slight parabolic upward curvature to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes . The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards , but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on , they would meet about a mile above the centre of the building ; since they are all the same height , the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the architrave and roof above : " all follow the rule of being built to delicate curves " . 
 The golden ratio was known in 300 B.C. , when Euclid described the method of geometric construction . It has been argued that the golden ratio was used in the design of the Parthenon and other ancient Greek buildings , as well as sculptures , paintings , and vases . More recent authors such as Nikos Salingaros , however , doubt all these claims . Experiments by the computer scientist George <unk> failed to find any preference for the golden rectangle . 
 = = = = Islamic architecture = = = = 
 The historian of Islamic art Antonio Fernandez @-@ <unk> suggests that the Alhambra , like the Great Mosque of Cordoba , was designed using the Hispano @-@ Muslim foot or <unk> of about 0 @.@ 62 metres ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) . In the palace 's Court of the Lions , the proportions follow a series of <unk> . A rectangle with sides 1 and √ 2 has ( by Pythagoras 's theorem ) a diagonal of √ 3 , which describes the right triangle made by the sides of the court ; the series continues with √ 4 ( giving a 1 : 2 ratio ) , √ 5 and so on . The decorative patterns are similarly proportioned , √ 2 generating squares inside circles and eight @-@ pointed stars , √ 3 generating six @-@ pointed stars . There is no evidence to support earlier claims that the golden ratio was used in the Alhambra . The Court of the Lions is bracketed by the Hall of Two Sisters and the Hall of the <unk> ; a regular hexagon can be drawn from the centres of these two halls and the four inside corners of the Court of the Lions . 
 The Selimiye Mosque in Edirne , Turkey , was built by Mimar Sinan to provide a space where the mihrab could be see from anywhere inside the building . The very large central space is accordingly arranged as an octagon , formed by 8 enormous pillars , and capped by a circular dome of 31 @.@ 25 metres ( 102 @.@ 5 ft ) diameter and 43 metres ( 141 ft ) high . The octagon is formed into a square with four semidomes , and externally by four exceptionally tall minarets , 83 metres ( 272 ft ) tall . The building 's plan is thus a circle inside an octagon inside a square . 
 = = = = Mughal architecture = = = = 
 Mughal architecture , as seen in the abandoned imperial city of Fatehpur Sikri and the Taj Mahal complex , has a distinctive mathematical order and a strong aesthetic based on symmetry and harmony . 
 The Taj Mahal exemplifies Mughal architecture , both representing paradise and displaying the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan 's power through its scale , symmetry and costly decoration . The white marble mausoleum , decorated with pietra dura , the great gate ( Darwaza @-@ i <unk> ) , other buildings , the gardens and paths together form a unified hierarchical design . The buildings include a mosque in red sandstone on the west , and an almost identical building , the <unk> or ' answer ' on the east to maintain the bilateral symmetry of the complex . The formal charbagh ( ' fourfold garden ' ) is in four parts , symbolising the four rivers of paradise , and offering views and reflections of the mausoleum . These are divided in turn into 16 parterres . 
 The Taj Mahal complex was laid out on a grid , subdivided into smaller grids . The historians of architecture Koch and Barraud agree with the traditional accounts that give the width of the complex as 374 Mughal yards or gaz , the main area being three 374 @-@ gaz squares . These were divided in areas like the bazaar and caravanserai into 17 @-@ gaz modules ; the garden and terraces are in modules of 23 gaz , and are 368 gaz wide ( 16 x 23 ) . The mausoleum , mosque and guest house are laid out on a grid of 7 gaz . Koch and Barraud observe that if an octagon , used repeatedly in the complex , is given sides of 7 units , then it has a width of 17 units , which may help to explain the choice of ratios in the complex . 
 = = = = Christian architecture = = = = 
 The Christian patriarchal basilica of <unk> Sophia in Byzantium ( now Istanbul ) , first constructed in 537 ( and twice rebuilt ) , was for a thousand years the largest cathedral ever built . It inspired many later buildings including Sultan Ahmed and other mosques in the city . The Byzantine architecture includes a nave crowned by a circular dome and two half @-@ domes , all of the same diameter ( 31 metres ( 102 ft ) ) , with a further five smaller half @-@ domes forming an apse and four rounded corners of a vast rectangular interior . This was interpreted by mediaeval architects as representing the mundane below ( the square base ) and the divine heavens above ( the soaring spherical dome ) . The emperor Justinian used two geometers , Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles as architects ; Isidore compiled the works of Archimedes on solid geometry , and was influenced by him . 
 The importance of water baptism in Christianity was reflected in the scale of baptistry architecture . The oldest , the Lateran Baptistry in Rome , built in 440 , set a trend for octagonal baptistries ; the baptismal font inside these buildings was often octagonal , though Italy 's largest baptistry , at Pisa , built between 1152 and 1363 , is circular , with an octagonal font . It is 54 @.@ 86 metres ( 180 @.@ 0 ft ) high , with a diameter of 34 @.@ 13 metres ( 112 @.@ 0 ft ) ( a ratio of 8 : 5 ) . Saint Ambrose wrote that fonts and baptistries were octagonal " because on the eighth day , by rising , Christ loosens the bondage of death and receives the dead from their graves . " Saint Augustine similarly described the eighth day as " everlasting ... hallowed by the resurrection of Christ " . The octagonal Baptistry of Saint John , Florence , built between 1059 and 1128 , is one of the oldest buildings in that city , and one of the last in the direct tradition of classical antiquity ; it was extremely influential in the subsequent Florentine Renaissance , as major architects including Francesco <unk> , Alberti and Brunelleschi used it as the model of classical architecture . 
 The number five is used " exuberantly " in the 1721 Pilgrimage Church of St John of Nepomuk at <unk> hora , near <unk> nad Sázavou in the Czech republic , designed by Jan <unk> Santini <unk> . The nave is circular , surrounded by five pairs of columns and five oval domes alternating with ogival apses . The church further has five gates , five chapels , five altars and five stars ; a legend claims that when Saint John of Nepomuk was martyred , five stars appeared over his head . The fivefold architecture may also symbolise the five wounds of Christ and the five letters of " <unk> " ( Latin : " I kept silence " [ about secrets of the confessional ] ) . 
 Antoni Gaudí used a wide variety of geometric structures , some being minimal surfaces , in the Sagrada Família , Barcelona , started in 1882 ( and not completed as of 2015 ) . These include hyperbolic paraboloids and <unk> of revolution , tessellations , catenary arches , <unk> , helicoids , and ruled surfaces . This varied mix of geometries is creatively combined in different ways around the church . For example , in the Passion Façade of Sagrada Família , Gaudí assembled stone " branches " in the form of hyperbolic paraboloids , which overlap at their tops ( directrices ) without , therefore , meeting at a point . In contrast , in the colonnade there are hyperbolic <unk> surfaces that smoothly join other structures to form unbounded surfaces . Further , Gaudí exploits natural patterns , themselves mathematical , with columns derived from the shapes of trees , and lintels made from unmodified basalt naturally cracked ( by cooling from molten rock ) into hexagonal columns . 
 The 1971 Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption , San Francisco has a saddle roof composed of eight segments of hyperbolic paraboloids , arranged so that the bottom horizontal cross section of the roof is a square and the top cross section is a Christian cross . The building is a square 77 @.@ 7 metres ( 255 ft ) on a side , and 57 @.@ 9 metres ( 190 ft ) high . The 1970 Cathedral of Brasília by Oscar Niemeyer makes a different use of a hyperboloid structure ; it is constructed from 16 identical concrete beams , each weighing 90 tonnes , arranged in a circle to form a hyperboloid of revolution , the white beams creating a shape like hands praying to heaven . Only the dome is visible from outside : most of the building is below ground .

 = = = Islamic architectural decoration = = = 
 Islamic buildings are often decorated with geometric patterns which typically make use of several mathematical tessellations , formed of ceramic tiles ( girih , zellige ) that may themselves be plain or decorated with stripes . Symmetries such as stars with six , eight , or multiples of eight points are used in Islamic patterns . Some of these are based on the ' <unk> <unk> ' or Solomon 's seal motif , which is an eight @-@ pointed star made of two squares , one rotated 45 degrees from the other on the same centre . Islamic patterns exploit many of the 17 possible wallpaper groups ; as early as 1944 , Edith Müller showed that the Alhambra made use of 11 wallpaper groups in its decorations , while in 1986 Branko <unk> claimed to have found 13 wallpaper groups in the Alhambra , asserting controversially that the remaining 4 groups are not found anywhere in Islamic ornament . 
 = = = Modern architectural decoration = = = 
 Towards the end of the 20th century , novel mathematical constructs such as fractal geometry and aperiodic tiling were seized upon by architects to provide interesting and attractive coverings for buildings . In 1913 , the Modernist architect Adolf Loos had declared that " Ornament is a crime " , influencing architectural thinking for the rest of the 20th century . In the 21st century , architects are again starting to explore the use of ornament . 21st century ornamentation is extremely diverse . Henning Larsen 's 2011 <unk> Concert and Conference Centre , Reykjavik has what looks like a crystal wall of rock made of large blocks of glass . Foreign Office Architects ' 2010 Ravensbourne College , London is tessellated decoratively with 28 @,@ 000 <unk> aluminium tiles in red , white and brown , interlinking circular windows of differing sizes . The tessellation uses three types of tile , an equilateral triangle and two irregular pentagons . Kazumi Kudo 's Kanazawa <unk> Library creates a decorative grid made of small circular blocks of glass set into plain concrete walls . 
 = = Defence = = 
 The architecture of fortifications evolved from medieval fortresses , which had high masonry walls , to low , symmetrical star forts able to resist artillery bombardment between the mid @-@ fifteenth and nineteenth centuries . The geometry of the star shapes was dictated by the need to avoid dead zones where attacking infantry could shelter from defensive fire ; the sides of the projecting points were angled to permit such fire to sweep the ground , and to provide crossfire ( from both sides ) beyond each projecting point . Well @-@ known architects who designed such defences include Michelangelo , Baldassare Peruzzi , Vincenzo Scamozzi and Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban . 
 The architectural historian Siegfried Giedion argued that the star @-@ shaped fortification had a formative influence on the patterning of the Renaissance ideal city : " The Renaissance was hypnotized by one city type which for a century and a half — from <unk> to Scamozzi — was impressed upon all utopian schemes : this is the star @-@ shaped city . " 
 = = Environmental goals = = 
 Architects may also select the form of a building to meet environmental goals . For example , Foster and Partners ' 30 St Mary Axe , London , known as " The Gherkin " for its cucumber @-@ like shape , is a solid of revolution designed using parametric modelling . Its geometry was chosen not purely for aesthetic reasons , but to minimise whirling air currents at its base . Despite the building 's apparently curved surface , all the panels of glass forming its skin are flat , except for the lens at the top . Most of the panels are quadrilaterals , as they can be cut from rectangular glass with less wastage than triangular panels . 
 The traditional <unk> ( ice pit ) of Persia functioned as an evaporative cooler . Above ground , the structure had a domed shape , but had a subterranean storage space for ice and sometimes food as well . The subterranean space and the thick heat @-@ resistant construction insulated the storage space year round . The internal space was often further cooled with <unk> . The ice was available in the summer to make the frozen dessert <unk> .

 Thomas George " Tom " Hooper ( born 5 October 1972 ) is a British film and television director of English and Australian background . Hooper began making short films as a teenager , and had his first professional short , Painted Faces , broadcast on Channel 4 in 1992 . At Oxford University Hooper directed plays and television commercials . After graduating , he directed episodes of Quayside , Byker Grove , EastEnders and Cold Feet . 
 In the 2000s , Hooper directed the major BBC costume dramas Love in a Cold Climate ( 2001 ) and Daniel Deronda ( 2002 ) , and was selected to helm the 2003 revival of ITV 's Prime Suspect series , starring Helen Mirren . Hooper made his feature film debut with Red Dust ( 2004 ) , a British drama starring Hilary Swank and Chiwetel Ejiofor , before directing Helen Mirren again in the Company Pictures / HBO Films historical drama Elizabeth I ( 2005 ) . He continued working for HBO on the television film Longford ( 2006 ) and in John Adams ( 2008 ) , a seven @-@ part serial on the life of the American president . Hooper returned to features with The Damned United ( 2009 ) , a fact @-@ based film about the English football manager Brian Clough ( played by Michael Sheen ) . The following year saw the release of the historical drama The King 's Speech ( 2010 ) , starring Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush , which was met with critical acclaim . Hooper 's next film was Les Misérables ( 2012 ) , which featured an all @-@ star cast led by Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe . 
 Hooper 's work was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for Prime Suspect and John Adams , won one for Elizabeth I , and was nominated for the British Academy ( BAFTA ) TV Craft Award for Best Director for Longford . The King 's Speech won multiple awards , including Best Director wins for Hooper from the Directors Guild of America and the Academy Awards , and a Best Director nomination from BAFTA . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Tom Hooper was born in 1972 in London , England , the son of Meredith Jean ( Rooney ) and Richard Hooper . Meredith was an Australian author and academic and Richard was an English media businessman . Hooper was educated at Highgate School and Westminster School . His initial interest in drama was triggered by his English and drama teacher at Highgate , former Royal Shakespeare Company actor Roger Mortimer , who produced an annual school play . 
 At the age of 12 , Hooper read a book entitled How to Make Film and Television and decided he wanted to become a director . For the next year Hooper researched filmmaking from publications such as On Camera by Harris Watts . Aged 13 , he made his first film , entitled Runaway Dog , using a clockwork 16mm Bolex camera his uncle had given to him . Hooper said : " The clockwork would run out after thirty seconds , so the maximum shot length was thirty seconds . I could only afford a hundred feet of Kodachrome reversal film , which cost about twenty @-@ five [ pounds ] , and you had to send off for two weeks to be processed . I could only make silent movies , because sound was too expensive and complicated . " He slowed down the frame rate of the camera so he could maximise what little film stock he had . Hooper classified the short , about a dog which kept running away from its owner , as a comedy , and filmed it on location in Oxfordshire . 
 When Hooper was 14 , his film Bomber Jacket came runner @-@ up in a BBC younger filmmakers ' competition . The short starred Hooper 's brother as a boy who discovers a bomber jacket and a photograph hidden in a cupboard and learns his grandfather died in World War II . Another of Hooper 's short films , entitled Countryside , depicts a nuclear holocaust . 
 Hooper finished school aged 16 , then wrote the script for his first professional short film , entitled Painted Faces . He spent the next two years raising capital for the short by courting advertisement directors , whose financial dominance during the late 1980s was noticed by Hooper . Director Paul Weiland invested in the short , which provided Hooper with the equipment he needed . After two years of financing and production , Painted Faces was completed . Hooper wrote , produced , directed and edited it . It was sold to Channel 4 and broadcast on the channel 's First Frame strand in 1992 , had a screening at the 35th London Film Festival and had a limited theatrical release . 
 After taking a gap year to finance Painted Faces , Hooper read English at University College , Oxford . He joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society , where he directed Kate Beckinsale in A View From the Bridge and Emily Mortimer in The Trial . Hooper also had his first paid directing work , earning £ 200 for a corporate Christmas video , and he directed his first television advertisements , including one for Sega featuring Right Said Fred . He continues to direct advertisements alongside television and film projects . In 1996 he joined the commercial production company John S. Clarke Productions and in 2001 he signed with Infinity Productions .

 After graduating from Oxford , Hooper directed further television commercials , intending to break into the film industry the same way Ridley Scott , Tony Scott and Hugh Hudson did . He was introduced by his father to the television producer Matthew Robinson , who mentored Hooper and gave him his first television directing work . For Robinson , Hooper directed episodes of the short @-@ lived Tyne Tees Television soap opera Quayside in 1997 , four episodes of the Children 's BBC television series Byker Grove in the same year , and his first episodes of the BBC One soap opera EastEnders in 1998 . 
 Hooper directed several EastEnders episodes between 1998 and 2000 , two of which were hour @-@ long specials that represented the soap when it won the British Academy Television Award for Best Soap Opera in 2000 and 2001 ; the first was the episode in which Carol Jackson ( Lindsey Coulson ) learns her daughter Bianca ( Patsy Palmer ) had an affair with her fiancé Dan Sullivan ( Craig Fairbrass ) . The Jackson episode marked the beginning of a week of episodes that lead to Palmer 's departure from the soap , and Robinson had hired Hooper to direct the key episodes of that storyline . Hooper worked 10 @-@ hour days on EastEnders , and learned to direct with speed . He was influenced in his early career by the cinematic style of American TV series such as ER , NYPD Blue and Homicide : Life on the Street and tried to work that style into his EastEnders episodes ; one scene featuring Grant Mitchell ( Ross Kemp ) involved a crane shot , which Hooper believes made him infamous among the EastEnders production crew . 
 In 1999 , Hooper directed two episodes of Granada Television 's comedy @-@ drama television series Cold Feet , which marked his move to bigger @-@ budget productions . There was initially concern at Granada that Hooper might be an unsuitable director for the series given his background in drama . 
 In 2000 , Hooper directed his first of two costume dramas for the BBC ; Love in a Cold Climate was based on Nancy Mitford 's novels The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate . Hooper , the writer Deborah Moggach , and the producer Kate Harwood researched the period details of the production by interviewing Nancy 's sister Deborah . In 2002 , Hooper directed Daniel Deronda , adapted from George Eliot 's novel . Filming ran for 11 weeks from May to August on locations in England , Scotland and Malta . Hooper said of the production , " The thing I like about this tale is that it 's not at all your conventional costume drama ; it 's far more complex and looks at aspects of love , loss and religion . " The Guardian 's Mark Lawson said of Hooper 's two costume dramas , " he brought verve and intelligence to television 's most conservative form " . 
 Hooper returned to Granada the next year to direct the revival of Prime Suspect , entitled The Last Witness . The two @-@ part serial was the first Prime Suspect instalment to be made since 1995 , when star Helen Mirren quit . Hooper initially declined to direct the production because he believed the series was tired . Granada 's head of drama Andy Harries introduced Hooper to Mirren , who persuaded him to take the job by promising that he could make the serial his own way . The two @-@ part serial was broadcast on the ITV network in November 2003 . Hooper 's direction received praise from Andrew Billen in the New Statesman : " Tom Hooper proved an outstanding director , imposing a bleak , overlit hyper @-@ realism on the search for a killer in a hospital , isolating Mirren in rows of empty chairs and playing on the eyewitness / optical visual metaphors . " The serial was also broadcast on PBS in the United States . Hooper received nominations for the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Serial and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries , Movie or Dramatic Special for his work on Prime Suspect . 
 = = = Film debut and HBO works = = = 
 Hooper made his debut as a feature film director with the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission drama Red Dust ( 2004 ) , which stars Hilary Swank , Chiwetel Ejiofor and Jamie Bartlett . The film was not widely seen , which Hooper attributed to media coverage of torture during the Iraq War : " When I started making it you could watch the movie with a wonderful sense of ' we 'd never do it in our own country … they 're the horrible people but it 's not us . ' By the time the film came out ( there were ) these revelations that the Americans were torturing , the British were torturing . The film became a lot more uncomfortable for the very audiences it was designed to target . I have learned that sadly the theatrical audience does not run to see films that are openly issue led . " The premiere of the film in the United Kingdom came on BBC Two in 2005 , making it eligible for the BAFTA Television Awards ; it was nominated in the Best Single Drama category at the 2006 ceremony . 
 In 2005 , Hooper was asked by Helen Mirren to direct the Company Pictures / HBO Films two @-@ part serial Elizabeth I , in which she was starring . The serial won Hooper his first Emmy Award , for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries , Movie or Dramatic Special . In January 2006 , Hooper commenced filming the Granada / HBO television film Longford . The film dramatises the failed efforts of Lord Longford ( played by Jim Broadbent ) to secure the release from prison of Moors murderer Myra Hindley ( played by Samantha Morton ) . Hooper first met with the writer Peter Morgan about the production in 2005 and the film was broadcast on Channel 4 in October 2006 . Seb Morton @-@ Clark for the Financial Times called Longford one of the most accomplished television dramas of 2006 , and praised the writer and director : " Morgan and director Tom Hooper wove a seamless narrative about obsession – and not just that of the misguided philanthropist for the incarcerated Hindley or even that that existed between the sadistic lovers themselves . More significantly , by using chunks of original television footage , they painted a stark picture of the zealotry of a vengeful nation and its press over the supposed embodiment of evil . " Hooper 's continued successes led him to be ranked at number four in the Directors category of Broadcast magazine 's annual Hot 100 . The following year he was nominated for the British Academy Television Craft Award for Best Director for Longford . 
 Elizabeth I and Longford led directly to Hooper being selected by Tom Hanks to direct the epic miniseries John Adams for Playtone and HBO . Hooper had been working on a biographical film with Joan Didion about Katharine Graham , publisher of The Washington Post , since 2006 when he was asked by Hanks to helm the programme . The miniseries , starring Paul Giamatti as John Adams , was based on David McCullough 's Adams biography and was Hooper 's first wholly American production . He was surprised to learn that the American Revolutionary War was not a well @-@ documented period in film and television ; Abigail Adams actress Laura Linney told him that , for her generation , the musical 1776 was the most well @-@ known depiction of the era . He worked on the miniseries for a total of 16 months ; principal photography lasted 110 days on locations in the United States , France , England and Hungary and he controlled a $ 100 million budget . The Boston Globe 's Matthew Gilbert complimented Hooper 's style of direction in the first two episodes " Join or Die " and " Independence " : 
 Director Tom Hooper lets his actors shine , as he did so marvelously in Helen Mirren 's Elizabeth I and the child @-@ killer drama Longford , but he complements them , too , with this kind of immediate point of view . And when he does give us panoramic shots from afar – of the Adams farm in Braintree , for example – they 're askew , to keep us out of the classroom mode . At the end of episode 2 [ ... ] Hooper showcases all his directorial strength with one bold choice . When the long @-@ fretting Congress finally decides to break with Britain , he refrains from using any visual or aural tweaks . Upon the announcement , " The resolution carries , " the scene remains perfectly silent for one long moment . The terror of responsibility hangs heavily in the room , while a victorious soundtrack surely would have chased it away . 
 John Adams received 23 Emmy Award nominations , including another Outstanding Direction nomination for Hooper , and won 13 , the highest number for any nominee in a single year . He was also nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement . At the beginning of 2009 , he was profiled for The Observer 's film Hotlist .

 The wake of John Adams ' Emmy wins brought offers to Hooper from studios to direct spy and comic book films , which he declined . In November 2007 , he signed on to direct The Damned United , reuniting him with Peter Morgan and Andy Harries . The film was an adaptation of David Peace 's novel The Damned Utd , a fictional version of the 44 turbulent days English football manager Brian Clough spent as manager of Leeds United . It was originally developed by Stephen Frears for Michael Sheen to play Clough . Frears quit the project after he was unable to translate the book to film . Hooper received a copy of the script while shooting John Adams in Hungary and noticed a similarity between the " egotistical , flawed , brilliant " Adams and the " egotistical , flawed , brilliant " Clough . He was not put off by joining the project later , as Morgan 's script was in only its first draft . During pre @-@ production , Hooper engaged in meticulous research , particularly on the locations and the football grounds of the era . He cast Timothy Spall as Clough 's assistant Peter Taylor , Colm Meaney as Don Revie and Jim Broadbent as Derby County chairman Sam Longson . During editing , it was decided to make the tone of the film lighter in order to attract audiences and to appease the real people depicted in the film . The Damned United was released in 2009 . 
 Work on Hooper 's next film , The King 's Speech , began in the same year . Hooper explained : " It was a stage play , and my mother who 's Australian was invited to a fringe [ theatre ] reading in London because she 's part of the Australian community . The play 's about the relationship between King George the Sixth and his Australian speech therapist . She came back and said ' you 've got to read this play , ' and I read it and it was brilliant ... " . Hooper cast Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue and spent three weeks with the actors reading the script and rehearsing . Principal photography took place on location around the UK from November 2009 to January 2010 . During editing , Hooper continued to consult with Firth and Rush by sending them cuts of the film and listening to their feedback . 
 Hooper completed the final cut of the film at the end of August 2010 and presented it a few days later at the Telluride Film Festival . The film won the People 's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival and Hooper won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures . In February 2011 , he was presented with the Academy Award for Best Director , though lost the BAFTA Award for Best Direction to David Fincher . In comparing the two films , Variety 's Adam <unk> wrote , " Hooper 's 2009 film The Damned United didn 't register among awards selectors , but King 's Speech is a much more personal project . His Anglo @-@ Australian parentage reflects the culture clash at the heart of the movie , and it pays off with beautifully crafted , crowd @-@ pleasing drama . "

 Following the success of The King 's Speech during the awards season , Hooper joined the 15 @-@ person board of governors at the British Film Institute , was invited to join the directors branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , and was ranked at number 19 in The Times ' British Film Power 100 . In March 2009 , Hooper met with Nelson Mandela in preparation for directing a film adaptation of Mandela 's autobiography Long Walk to Freedom . By 2012 , however , he had left the project . 
 He was offered the chance to direct Iron Man 3 for Marvel Studios but declined and instead signed on to direct Les Misérables for Working Title Films , which he had first heard about while discussing a different project with screenwriter William Nicholson in 2010 . Hooper had not seen the musical , so watched a performance of it in London 's West End . Adapted from the musical , the film starred Hugh Jackman , Russell Crowe , Anne Hathaway , Amanda Seyfried , Helena Bonham Carter , Sacha Baron Cohen , and Eddie Redmayne . As the film required the actors to sing and dance , they were auditioned in front of Hooper , producers and composers . The role of <unk> was hugely contested ; Hooper said , " It was like half a dozen of the biggest female movie stars on the planet wanted to play the role " . 
 Filming started in February 2012 . Hooper investigated filming the feature in 3D , and performed some camera tests before deciding to film it with traditional 2D methods . He stated " [ ... ] I slightly worry with 3D that some people will physically struggle with it . If you have a certain type of eyesight it can be more demanding than watching a normal movie . " Unlike other musical films , Les Misérables features the actors singing live on camera , rather than miming to backing vocals . Hooper told Los Angeles Times that he thought there was a " slightly strange falseness " when he saw musical films where the actors sang to recordings . The actors wore wireless earpieces on set so they could sing to accompanying piano music . Hooper believed this method allowed the actors to have emotional control over their songs : " When Annie [ Hathaway , who plays <unk> ] is singing ' I Dreamed a Dream ' , if she needs to take a tenth of a second to have a thought before she sings it , or to have an emotion before she sings a line , she can take it . " The actors also performed their songs in recitative style , which Hooper likened to being immersed in a 3D film . Les Miserables was released in North America on 25 December 2012 , and received eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture . 
 Hooper 's fifth feature film , The Danish Girl , was released in late 2015 . It loosely tells the story of Lili Elbe , one of the first people to undergo sex reassignment surgery , and wife Gerda Wegener . It stars Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander , both of whom received Academy Award nominations . Critics were generally positive about the film . 
 = = Directing style = = 
 Hooper uses camera styles " that encode the DNA of the storytelling in some way " and will reuse and develop filming styles in successive productions . Hooper identifies research as being key to his process of directing period dramas such as John Adams in order to make the scenes authentic . For The Damned United , Hooper and director of photography Ben <unk> researched the look of the late 1960s and early 1970s through football photography books . Hooper has also been influenced by cinematographer Larry Smith , who worked with Stanley Kubrick and advised Hooper of techniques used by Kubrick . Hooper and Smith have worked together on Cold Feet , Love in a Cold Climate , Prime Suspect , Red Dust and Elizabeth I. 
 Hooper also uses uncommon framing techniques to emphasise story ; in John Adams , he wanted to imply American independence seemed unlikely during the Revolutionary War , so he used " a very rough camera style — almost all hand held , wide lenses close to the actors , lots of movement , many cameras shooting at once so there was often not a settled master " point of view " , and lots of <unk> dutch tilts so the horizon lines of the frame were often being thrown off . " The America @-@ set scenes were contrasted by the scenes set in France , in which more traditional filming techniques were employed to evoke a feel of entrenched values . Similarly , in The Damned United , Hooper began to experiment with using wide @-@ angle lenses and putting actors in the extreme edges of the frame . He was influenced by the unusual framing from social photography of the 1970s , and he and Ben <unk> decided to adopt the framing style while scouting locations . Hooper used the same style in The King 's Speech , particularly in the scene where Bertie and Logue meet in Logue 's consulting room ; Colin Firth is framed to the extreme left of the picture , leaving most of the shot dominated by the rough wall behind Firth . 
 Another frequently used technique is Hooper 's tendency to use a variety of focal length camera lenses to distort the resulting picture . In The Damned United he used a <unk> lens , notably in the scene where Clough stays inside during the Derby – Leeds match . Hooper operated the camera in this scene himself . In The King 's Speech , Hooper used " typically 14mm , 18mm , <unk> , 25mm and 27mm " lenses and put the camera close to the actors ' faces . Hooper said the use of this method in the first consulting room scene served to " suggest the <unk> and tension of Logue and Bertie 's first meeting " .

 = Ernest II , Duke of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha = 
 Ernest II ( German : Ernst August Karl Johann Leopold Alexander Eduard ; 21 June 1818 – 22 August 1893 ) was the sovereign duke of the Duchy of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha , reigning from 1844 to his death . Ernest was born in Coburg as the eldest child of Ernest III , Duke of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Saalfeld , and his duchess , Princess Louise of Saxe @-@ Gotha @-@ Altenburg . Fourteen months later , his younger brother Prince Albert was born , who later became consort of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom . Ernest 's father became Duke of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha in 1826 through an exchange of territories . 
 In 1842 , Ernest married Princess Alexandrine of Baden in what was to be a childless marriage . Soon after , he succeeded as duke upon the death of his father on 29 January 1844 . As reigning Duke Ernest II , he supported the German Confederation in the Schleswig @-@ Holstein Wars against Denmark , sending thousands of troops and becoming the commander of a German corps ; as such , he was instrumental in the 1849 victory at the battle of Eckernförde against Danish forces . After King Otto of Greece was deposed in 1862 , the British government put Ernest 's name forward as a possible successor . Negotiations fell through however for various reasons , not in the least of which was that he would not give up his beloved duchies in favor of the Greek throne . 
 A supporter of a unified Germany , Ernest watched the various political movements with great interest . While he initially was a great and outspoken proponent of the liberal movement , he surprised many by switching sides and supporting the more conservative ( and eventually victorious ) Prussians during the Austro @-@ Prussian and Franco @-@ Prussian wars and subsequent unification of Germany . His support of the conservatives came at a price however , and he was no longer viewed as the possible leader of a political movement . According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat , Ernest became " increasingly lost in a whirl of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside " . 
 Ernest 's position was often linked to his brother Prince Albert , husband of Queen Victoria . The two boys were raised as though twins , and became closer upon the separation and divorce of their parents , as well as the eventual death of their mother . The princes ' relationship experienced phases of closeness as well as minor arguments as they grew older ; after Albert 's death in 1861 , Ernest became gradually more antagonistic to Victoria and her children , as well as increasingly bitter toward the United Kingdom , publishing anonymous pamphlets against various members of the British royal family . Despite their increasingly differing political views and opinions however , Ernest accepted his second eldest nephew Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh as his heir @-@ presumptive , who upon Ernest 's death on 22 August 1893 at <unk> , succeeded to the ducal throne . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Ernest , Hereditary Prince of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Saalfeld , was born at Ehrenburg Palace in Coburg on 21 June 1818 . He was the elder son of Ernest III , Duke of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Saalfeld and his first wife Princess Louise of Saxe @-@ Gotha @-@ Altenburg . He was soon joined by a brother , Prince Albert , who would later become the husband of Queen Victoria . Though Duke Ernest fathered numerous children in various affairs , the two boys would have no other legitimate siblings . In 1826 , their father succeeded as Ernest I , Duke of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha through an exchange of territories after the death of the duke 's uncle , Frederick IV , Duke of Saxe @-@ Gotha @-@ Altenburg . 
 There are various accounts of Ernest 's childhood . When he was fourteen months old , a servant commented that Ernest " runs around like a weasel . He is teething and as cross as a little badger from impatience and liveliness . He is not pretty now , except his beautiful black eyes " . In May 1820 , his mother described Ernest as " very big for his age , as well as intelligent . His big black eyes are full of spirit and vivacity " . Biographer Richard Hough writes that " even from their infancy , it was plainly evident that the elder son took after his father , in character and appearance , while Albert strongly resembled his mother in most respects " . Ernest and his brother often lived with their grandmother the Dowager Duchess of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Saalfeld until her death in 1831 . 
 He and Albert were brought up and educated together as if they were twins . Though Albert was fourteen months younger , he surpassed Ernest intellectually . According to their tutor , " they went hand @-@ in @-@ hand in all things , whether at work or at play . Engaging in the same pursuits , sharing the same joys and the same sorrows , they were bound to each other by no common feelings of mutual love " . Perhaps the " sorrows " aforementioned related to their parents ' marriage . It was not a happy one and Duke Ernest I was continually unfaithful . In 1824 , Ernest I and Louise divorced ; she subsequently left Coburg and was disallowed from seeing her sons again . She soon remarried to Alexander von Hanstein , Count of <unk> and <unk> , dying in 1831 at the age of thirty . The year after her death , their father remarried his niece Duchess Marie of Württemberg , who was his sister Antoinette 's daughter . Their stepmother was thus also their first cousin . The duke and his new duchess were not close , and would produce no children ; while the boys formed a happy relationship with their stepmother , Marie had little to no input in her stepsons ' lives . The separation and divorce of their parents , as well as the later death of their mother left the boys scarred and in close companionship with each other . 
 In 1836 , Ernest and Albert visited their <unk> eligible cousin Princess Victoria of Kent , spending a few weeks at Windsor . Both boys , and especially Albert were considered by his family to be a potential husband for the young princess , and they were both taught to speak competent English . Their father first thought that Ernest would make a better husband to Victoria than Albert , possibly because his sporting interests would be better received by the British public . Most others favored Albert over Ernest as a possible husband however . <unk> , Victoria was much more like Ernest , as both were lively and sociable with a love for dancing , gossip , and late nights ; conversely , this fast pace made Albert physically ill . Victoria believed Ernest had a " most kind , honest , and intelligent expression in his countenance " , while Albert " seemed full of goodness and sweetness , and very clever and intelligent " . No offer of marriage was forthcoming for either brother however , and they returned home . 
 Ernest entered military training later that year . In April 1837 , Ernest and Albert and their household moved to the University of Bonn . Six weeks into their academic term , Victoria succeeded as Queen of the United Kingdom . As rumors of an impending marriage between her and Albert interfered with their studies , the two brothers left on 28 August 1837 at the close of the term to travel around Europe . They returned to Bonn in early November to continue their studies . In 1839 , the brothers traveled to England again , where Victoria found her cousin Albert agreeable and soon proposed . This connection would have many implications upon Ernest in the future ; for instance , he was selected as godfather for Albert 's second daughter Princess Alice , and would eventually come to give her away at her wedding , only months after Albert 's death . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 Various candidates were put forward as a possible wife for Ernest . His own father wanted him to look high @-@ up for a wife , such as a Russian grand duchess . One possibility was Princess Clémentine of Orléans , a daughter of Louis Philippe I , whom he met while visiting the court at the Tuileries . Such a marriage would have required his conversion from Lutheranism to Roman Catholicism however , and consequently nothing came of it . She later married his cousin Prince August of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha . Ernest was also considered by Dowager Queen Maria Christina as a possible husband for her young daughter Isabella II of Spain , and by Queen Victoria for her cousin Princess Augusta of Cambridge . 
 In Karlsruhe on 3 May 1842 , Ernest married 21 @-@ year @-@ old Princess Alexandrine of Baden . She was the eldest daughter of Leopold , Grand Duke of Baden and Princess Sophie of Sweden , daughter of the deposed King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden . Though he gave his consent , his father was disappointed that his second son did not do more to advance the concerns of Coburg . The marriage did not produce any issue , though Ernest apparently fathered at least three illegitimate children in later years . 
 Ernest had suffered from a venereal disease in his late teens and early twenties , most likely as the consequence of living a wild , promiscuous lifestyle . These qualities he had inherited under the tutelage of his father , who took his sons to " sample the pleasures " of Paris and Berlin , to Albert 's " horror and shame " . Ernest had been so visibly deteriorating in appearance as a result that Sarah Lyttelton , a lady @-@ in @-@ waiting of Queen Victoria , observed at Windsor in 1839 that he was " very thin and hollow @-@ cheeked and pale , and no likeness to his brother , nor much beauty . But he has fine dark eyes and black hair , and light figure , and a great look of spirit and eagerness " . Later that year , Albert counseled his brother against finding a wife until his ' condition ' was fully recovered . He further warned that continued promiscuity could leave Ernest incapable of fathering children . Some historians believe that while he himself was able to father other children , the disease rendered his young wife infertile . 
 As the years went by with further childlessness , Ernest became more distant to his wife , and was continually unfaithful . Though Alexandrine continued to be devoted , choosing to ignore those relationships she was aware of , her loyalty became increasingly baffling to those outside her immediate family . By 1859 , after seventeen years of childlessness , Ernest took no further interest in his wife .

 On 29 January 1844 , Ernest 's father died in Gotha , one of the territories their family had recently acquired . Ernest consequently succeeded to the duchies of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha as Ernest II . 
 = = = Development of a constitution = = = 
 Extravagant to a great degree , Ernest had many money troubles throughout his reign . In January 1848 , Ernest visited his brother in the midst of political unrest in Germany . Upon his return , he also discovered unrest in Coburg . One of the many concerns related to finances . Although Ernest had a large inheritance , he also had frequent debts . There were increasing calls to nationalize most of his property . Indeed , Albert had to intervene at one point and spare his brother the embarrassment of losing one of his Coburg properties . 
 During the 1848 turmoil in Germany , Albert had been constructing his own liberal reform plan , under which a single monarch , chancellor , and parliament would unite the German states ; in addition , each state would retain its own current ruling dynasty . As this plan pertained to his brother , Ernest was given a copy in the hope that he would develop his own liberal constitution . Ernest subsequently made a few concessions , but his position remained sound , not counting the increasing problem of his debts . A constitution was drafted and promulgated in 1849 in Gotha , though one had existed in Coburg since 1821 . In 1852 , both constitutions were converged into one , which converted the personal union of the two duchies into a real union ; the duchies were now inseparable , with a common set of institutions . During the political turmoil , timely concessions and Ernest 's popular habit of mingling with " the people in their pleasures " were instrumental in keeping him from losing his throne . Furthermore , various contemporary sources state that Ernest was an able , just and very popular ruler , which may have also helped keep him in power . 
 = = = Schleswig @-@ Holstein wars = = = 
 From 1848 to 1864 , Denmark and the German Confederation fought over control of the two duchies of Schleswig and Holstein . Historically , the duchies had been ruled by Denmark since medieval times , but there remained a large German majority . This majority was sparked to rebellion after Frederick VII of Denmark announced on 27 March 1848 the duchies would become an integral part of Denmark under his new liberal constitution . Prussia soon became involved , supporting the uprising and beginning the First Schleswig War . Ernest sent 8 @,@ 000 men initially , adding to the army sent by the German Confederation . He also desired to be given a military job during the war , but was refused , as it was " extremely difficult to offer me a position in the army of Schleswig @-@ Holstein corresponding to my rank " , according to his memoirs . He agreed to a smaller command , coming to lead a Thuringian contingent ; he commented in a letter to his brother that " I should have declined any other command of the kind , but I could not refuse this one , as , in the present condition of our States , it is important to keep the executive power in our hands " . As commander of a German corps , Ernest was instrumental in winning the 5 April 1849 battle of Eckernförde against Danish forces . 
 The first war ended in 1851 , but would resume in 1864 . During this interlude , Ernest fervently opposed the marriage of his nephew Albert Edward , Prince of Wales ( ' Bertie ' ) to Princess Alexandra of Denmark , a daughter of the future Christian IX of Denmark ( and therefore an enemy of the German states ) . He believed that such a match flew in the face of German interests . Albert replied angrily " What has that got to do with you ? ... Vicky has racked her brains to help us to find someone , but in vain ... We have no [ other reasonable ] choice " . Albert agreed there were going to be problems with the match , but as he could find no alternative bride , he wrote to Ernest that keeping the affair a private matter ( and outside the realm of government ) was " the only way to prevent a break with Prussia and the only way to keep the game in our own hands , impose the conditions that we think necessary , and as far as we can , take off its political edge " . Albert also warned his son of Ernest 's endeavors to interfere with the match , commenting , " Your uncle ... will try his hand at this work . Your best defence will be not to enter on the subject , should he broach it " . 
 Soon after writing these letters , Prince Albert died on 14 December 1861 . His death helped Ernest repair his relationship with his sister @-@ in @-@ law , as Victoria had been becoming increasingly angrier over Ernest 's objections to the Danish match . The two brothers had always been close , whatever their disagreements , and Albert 's death left Ernest " wretched " , noted Victoria in a letter to her eldest daughter . The death did not solve their argument however ; seeing that his direct involvement had failed to persuade Victoria , Ernest tried a new tactic . He began to spread gossip about Alexandra and her family , in which her mother Princess Louise " had had illegitimate children and Alexandra had had flirtations with young officers " ; he also wrote to Louise herself , warning that Bertie would be an unfortunate choice for a husband . Additionally , Ernest met with his nephew at Thebes , most likely attempting to discourage him from the match in person . In an 11 April letter , Victoria unhappily noted to her eldest daughter " You did not tell me that Bertie had met Uncle Ernest at Thebes ... I am always alarmed when I think of Uncle Ernest and Bertie being together as I know the former will do all he can to set Bertie against the marriage with Princess Alix " . Despite Ernest 's disprovable , Bertie was duly married to Alexandra on 10 March 1863 . 
 The Duke had a reputation for being a strong friend of the United States , as did his brother Albert . He was , however , the only European sovereign to appoint a consul , Ernst Raven , to the Confederate States of America , on 30 July 1861 . The Texas government , where Raven resided , made it clear , however , that his request for an <unk> did not imply or extend diplomatic recognition to the Confederate regime . 
 = = = Nomination for the Greek throne = = = 
 On 23 October 1862 , Otto of Bavaria , King of Greece was deposed in a bloodless coup . The Greeks were eager to have someone close to Britain and Queen Victoria replace Otto ; some desired to allow Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh ( her second son ) succeed as King of Greece . He was elected with 95 % of the vote in the Greek head of state referendum of 1862 . After his ineligibility was confirmed however , the Greeks began looking for other possible candidates , which included Duke Ernest at the British government 's suggestion . To their and Victoria 's reasoning , if Ernest were to take the Greek throne , Alfred could immediately take up his inheritance and succeed Ernest as duke ( the Prince of Wales having passed his claim to the duchy of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha onto his younger brother ) . Many were in favor of his nomination , including Prime Minister Lord Palmerston and Ernest 's sister @-@ in @-@ law . In a letter written to her uncle Leopold I of Belgium , Victoria stated her support for a new royal branch of the House of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha ( as Leopold had been chosen as King of the Belgians in 1831 ) as well as her desire for her second son Alfred to succeed his uncle in the duchy . As negotiations continued however , she began to lose enthusiasm for the idea . 
 There were problems to the nomination ; Ernest had no children , and thus would have had to adopt one of the princes of his house to succeed him as King of Greece . To solve this problem , Ernest suggested to Palmerston that he simply take the title regent of Greece and hold the kingdom in trust for his chosen heir . He also stipulated that if he accepted the throne , it should be subject to certain guarantees by the other powers . The apparent deal @-@ breaker however was the fact that Ernest wanted to acquire the Greek throne and still maintain control of his " safer " duchies . In the end , the British cabinet thought the proposed conditions unacceptable . His proposals turned down , Ernest in turn refused . In 1863 , the Greek throne was accepted by another member of a royal family : the Princess of Wales ' younger brother Prince William of Denmark . Ernest would later comment , " That this cup was spared me , I always regarded as a piece of good fortune " . 
 = = = Austro @-@ Prussian and Franco @-@ Prussian Wars = = = 
 Ernest , like his brother , was in favor of a German unified , federal state . To best realize this goal , Ernest liked to dabble in whatever political system promised the most success . He subsequently watched the growth of liberalism in Germany with much interest and tried to build links with the movement 's leaders . During Albert 's lifetime , Ernest took a close interest in the movement for reform , and was perceived as a progressive within Germany . His favorable view of liberalism caused his duchy to become an asylum for political refugees from other German states . In 1863 , he attended the liberal Frankfurt Conference , which was openly avoided by more conservative Prussia . Though his attendance made him no friends in Prussia , he developed such strong contacts in Austria that many looked to him as a potential leader in the mounting conflict between the northern and southern powers . He grew tired of the advice he received from Albert on the subject however ; as Ernest " was by no means inclined to consent to an energetic rule such as I adopted immediately afterwards for the perfection of the constitutional system " , according to Albert 's letters . 
 The Austro @-@ Prussian War was triggered by the desire of German conservative leaders to unify , albeit on different terms than their liberal counterparts . Ernest urged Prussian leaders against the impending war , and was an active advocate of the Austrian cause . Though Ernest normally followed more liberal politics than many of his counterparts , he began switching his views to align more closely with Prussian Minister President Otto von Bismarck by the mid @-@ 1860s . Despite this change in his private political views , he still had strong publicly known Austrian ties , and no one foresaw that Ernest would immediately side with the better @-@ equipped Prussians upon breakout of the war . His reasoning is usually understood as acting in the best interests of his duchies , and by extension , of himself . Regardless , it was seen as a betrayal of former friends ; Queen Victoria commented that Ernest " might have agreed to neutrality - for that might be necessary , but to change colours I cannot think right " . 
 Ernest was fortunate in his support of victorious Prussia ; many other petty German dukes , princes , and kings who had supported Austria suffered immensely at Hohenzollern hands . Hanover , Hesse @-@ Kassel , and Nassau for instance were all annexed to Prussia at the expense of their respective rulers . Though he had only recently changed his political views , Ernest was allowed to ride at the head of his battalion during the victory parade . His eldest niece Prussian Crown Princess Victoria ( " Vicky " ) was for one pleased with his Prussian support and commented " I am not accustomed to hearing so much praise of Coburg here . [ Ernest ] was not among the crushed and beaten foe , it is sad enough as it is to see so many of one 's friends suffering from the effects of their miscalculations " . Victoria 's husband Crown Prince Frederick was also pleased with Ernest 's decision , writing in his journal 28 September 1871 , that the duke 's " society always affords me peculiar pleasure , especially ... when his heart beats so warmly for Germany " . 
 Ernest 's support of the Prussians in the Austro @-@ Prussian War and later Franco Prussian War meant he was no longer the potential leader of a political movement ; although it was true that he had been able to retain his duchies , it had come at a price . According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat , Ernest " was increasingly lost in a whirl of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside " . Ernest funneled his political thoughts into the private sphere , preferring to write covertly sponsored articles in the Coburg press that became increasingly embittered against England . In 1886 , Ernest published Co @-@ Regents and Foreign Influence in Germany , a pamphlet that greatly angered his family ; though produced anonymously , no one doubted that it was written by Ernest . It attacked Vicky as a disloyal German that was too dependent on her mother , and declared that she had been too indiscreet in passing along confidential information during both war and peacetime . Queen Victoria was furious , writing to Vicky , " What you told me of Uncle E and that pamphlet is simply monstrous . I assure you that I felt great difficulty in writing to him for his birthday , but I wrote it as short and cool as I could consistently with civility " . " Dear Uncle Ernest does us all a great deal of harm by his odd ways and uncontrollable tongue with his very lively imagination " .

 Later in his reign , Ernest 's actions managed to continually anger his sister @-@ in @-@ law . Though Victoria loved Ernest because he was Albert 's brother , she was displeased that Ernest was writing his memoirs , worrying about their contents mainly in regard to her dead husband . Despite their disputes , Ernest still met with Victoria and her family occasionally . In 1891 , they met in France ; Victoria 's lady @-@ in @-@ waiting commented " the old Duke of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Gotha has been here today with his wife . He is the Prince Consort 's only brother and an awful looking man , the Queen dislikes him particularly . He is always writing anonymous pamphlets against the Queen and the Empress Frederick , which naturally creates a great deal of annoyance in the family " . 
 Throughout his reign , Ernest had been known for his extravagance and womanizing ; as he grew older , Ernest enjoyed gossip and was " now a thoroughly disreputable old roué who enjoyed the outrage provoked by his actions " , leading Vicky to declare that her uncle " was his own enemy " . His behavior and manner of dress increasingly became a joke for younger generations . His great @-@ niece Marie of Edinburgh would later describe Ernest as " an old beau , squeezed into a frock @-@ coat too tight for his bulk and uncomfortably pinched in at the waist ' , sporting a top hat , lemon coloured gloves , and a rosebud in his lapel " . He put on weight and though on paper his wealth was large , he was still constantly in debt . 
 An excellent musician and amateur composer all his life , Ernest was a great patron of the arts and sciences in Coburg , often giving awards and titles to members of the artistic and scientific world , such as Paul <unk> , a German opera singer and chemist William Ernest Bush . Ernest composed songs , hymns , and cantatas , as well as musical pieces for opera and the stage , including Die <unk> ( 1842 ) , Tony , oder die <unk> ( 1849 ) , Casilda ( 1851 ) , Santa Chiara ( 1854 ) , and Zaïre , which met with success in Germany . He could also draw and play the piano . One of his operas , Diana von Solange ( 1858 ) , prompted Franz Liszt the following year to write an orchestral <unk> nach <unk> von E. H. z . <unk> , <unk> ( E. H. z . <unk> was short for Ernst Herzog zu Sachsen @-@ Coburg @-@ Gotha ) . However , its production at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1890 inspired dismal reviews , with one spectator commenting that its " music was simply rubbish " . Ernest was also an avid hunter and sportsman ; one contemporary remarked that he was " one of the foremost and keenest sportsman produced by the present century " . In addition , Ernest was an enthusiastic patron of everything connected with natural history , for instance traveling to Abyssinia with the German zoologist Alfred Brehm in 1862 . 
 Ernest II died at <unk> on 22 August 1893 after a short illness . A lifelong sportsman , his last words were apparently " Let the drive commence ! " His funeral was held in the <unk> in Coburg ; thousands of spectators came to the funeral , including Emperor Wilhelm and the Prince of Wales . He is buried in the ducal mausoleum in the Friedhof am <unk> which he himself had built in 1853 @-@ 8 . 
 Ernest was succeeded by his nephew Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh . 
 = = Inheritance to Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha = = 
 For much of Ernest 's reign , the heir presumptive to Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha was his only sibling Prince Albert , consort of Queen Victoria . When it became increasingly more clear that Ernest would be childless , the possibility of a personal union between his duchies and the United Kingdom became real , a reality that was deemed undesirable . Special arrangements were made by a combination of constitutional clauses and renunciations to pass Ernest 's throne to a son of Albert while preventing a personal union . Consequently , Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh , his brother 's second eldest son , was designated the childless Ernest 's heir presumptive on 14 December 1861 , when his older brother the Prince of Wales ( later Edward VII of the United Kingdom ) renounced his succession rights . 
 Issues arose over authority to control the upbringing of his heir @-@ presumptive . As head of the Coburg family , Ernest would normally have been able to arrange Alfred 's education and general upbringing unchallenged . This however was not the case . Alfred was torn between his British birth and his German inheritance . This was partly because Alfred was second @-@ in @-@ line to the United Kingdom until the birth of his nephew Prince Albert Victor , Duke of Clarence and Avondale , in 1864 . One example of the many problems of his education concerned the language he would speak . Although he grew up learning German , his native language was decided to be English . In addition , a naval career was chosen for Alfred , a common profession for a British prince but almost unheard of for a prince of Germany . Ernest also wanted Alfred to be educated in Coburg , but his brother refused . Albert 's refusal most likely stemmed from the negative British reaction that would have inevitably occurred and the fact that Albert was fearful of Alfred 's moral development . Thus despite Ernest 's protests , he went unheeded in Albert 's lifetime . In 1863 , Ernest told Victoria that it was time for Alfred to leave the navy and enter a German university . By March of the following year , it was decided that Alfred would attend Bonn University but be left to consider his future , as he was having reservations over permanently residing outside England . The matter was eventually resolved ; Alfred came to accept his inheritance , and Victoria understood and accepted that Ernest needed to be involved in the upbringing of his heir @-@ presumptive , with a strong German element added to his education and ( carefully chaperoned ) visits to Coburg .

 = Kersal Moor = 
 Kersal Moor is a recreation area in Kersal , Greater Manchester , England which consists of eight hectares of moorland bounded by Moor Lane , <unk> Road , St. Paul 's Churchyard and Singleton Brook . 
 Kersal Moor , first called <unk> or <unk> Moor , originally covered a much larger area , running down to the River Irwell . Evidence of activity during the Neolithic period has been discovered and the area was used by the Romans . It was the site of the first Manchester Racecourse and the second golf course to be built outside Scotland . It has been extensively used for other sporting pursuits , military manoeuvres and public gatherings such as the Great Chartist Meeting of 1838 , prompting the political theorist Friedrich Engels to dub it " the Mons Sacer of Manchester " . 
 With the increasing industrialisation and urbanisation of Manchester and Salford during the 18th and 19th centuries , the moor became one of the remaining areas of natural landscape of interest to amateur naturalists , one of whom collected the only known specimens of the now extinct moth species <unk> woodiella . It is now a Site of Biological Importance and in 2007 was designated as a Local Nature Reserve by English Nature . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Kersal Moor is one of the many <unk> ridges that formed along the Irwell Valley during the melting of the glaciers at the end of the last ice age . Typically for this type of landform , the subsoil is composed of sand mixed with coarse gravel . The 19th century botanist Richard Buxton described this as " Mr. E.W. Binney 's drift deposit no.2 ... a deposit of sharp forest sand , parted with layers of gravel composed of <unk> , Palaeozoic and Triassic rocks , well rounded , parted with layers of fine sand , and having every appearance of a regular deposit by water . " This deposit is overlaid with a thin topsoil supporting a range of mosses , heathers , grasses , ferns , common broom , gorse and some trees , which are predominantly oak with some rowan , cherry and other broadleaved species . The land to the south is elevated , rising to a high point towards the south west . From this elevated position there are views across Manchester to the Derbyshire hills in the south , to the Pennines in the north east and across the Irwell Valley and Salford in the west . The land falls away to the north , ending with two <unk> @-@ shaped hills on the northern edge , which were probably formed by sediment from the meltwater of the receding glaciers , in a process known as sedimentary fluting . The moor is criss @-@ crossed with footpaths , many of which cut through to the sand and gravel below . Singleton Brook , to the north of the moor , denotes the boundary between Salford and Prestwich . 
 = = History = = 
 Flint scrapers , knives and other materials associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder . The Roman road from Manchester ( Mamucium ) to Ribchester ( Bremetennacum ) roughly followed the line of the A56 road ( Bury New Road ) which is just to the east of Kersal Moor . There was a Roman camp at <unk> just to the west , and some have speculated that there may have been a second camp to the east , in the area known as Castle Hill , making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium . 
 The 18th century historian John Whitaker said of the moor : 
 " The moor of Kersal was in the time of the Romans , perhaps in that of the Britons before them , and for many ages after both , a thicket of oaks and a pasture for hogs ; and the little knolls , that so remarkably diversify the plain , and are annually covered with mingled crowds rising in ranks over ranks to the top , were once the occasional seats of the herdsmen that superintended these droves into the woods . " 
 However , the last of these trees were burnt around 1880 . 
 = = = Sport on the moor = = = 
 The first Manchester racecourse was sited on the moor . The earliest record of horse @-@ racing is contained in the following notice in the London Gazette of 2 – 5 May 1687 : 
 On <unk> Moore near Manchester in Lancashire on the 18th instant , a 20 £ . plate will be run for to carry ten stone and ride three heats , four miles each heat . And the next day another plate of 40 £ . will be run for at the same <unk> , riding the same heats and carrying the same weight . The horses marks are to be given in four days before to Mr. William Swarbrick at the King 's Arms in Manchester . 
 The racecourse is shown on the map of 1848 as a roughly oval @-@ shaped course extending around the west , north and east of the moor , crossing Moor Lane and carrying on around the ground that is now the home of Salford City F.C. , roughly following the line of what is now Nevile Road . John Byrom ( 1692 – 1763 ) , the owner of Kersal Cell , was greatly opposed to the racing and wrote a pamphlet against it , but the racing continued for fifteen years until , probably through Dr Byrom 's influence , they were stopped in 1746 , the year of the Jacobite rising . After this there is known to have been at least one race in 1750 ; regular fixtures recommenced in 1759 , and were then held every year until 1846 , when they were transferred to the New Barns racecourse . Racing carried on there until the new Castle Irwell Racecourse was built , just across the river from the moor , in Lower Broughton in 1847 . Today part of the course can still be seen as a wide , well @-@ worn path stretching from east to west along the northern side of the moor . 
 During the 18th century the moor was also used for nude male races , allowing females to study the form before choosing their mates . Indeed , in 1796 Roger Aytoun , known as " Spanking Roger " ( who was later a hero of the siege of Gibraltar ) acquired Hough Hall in Moston through marriage to the widowed Barbara Minshull , after such a race . 
 The moor has also been used for a number of other sporting activities . In the 18th and early 19th century archery was still practised as a village sport , and the archers of Broughton , Cheetham and Prestwich were renowned countrywide . The Broughton archers practised their sport on Kersal Moor and in 1793 the Manchester writer , James Ogden , composed a poem in praise of them , which begins : 
 The Broughton Archers , and the bowmen good 
 Of Lancashire , keep up the former name 
 Their sires <unk> 'd , for skill in archery ... 
 and ends with : 
 ... Near Kersal Moor the Broughton archers fix 
 Their targets pierced with many a well aimed shot . 
 By 1830 , however , archery had become the sport of gentlemen and an exclusive club called the " Broughton Archers " was formed , the membership of which included some of the most influential men in the town . They originally met at a public house nicknamed " Hard Backed Nan 's " on the site of <unk> where the Bishop of Manchester now resides , but after Bury New Road was built and the site became too public , they moved to the Turf Tavern on Kersal Moor . In 1818 a golf course was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club , a group of Manchester businessmen , some of whom had emigrated from Scotland . This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland . The course at that time consisted of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users . The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton Road . By 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few hundred yards away at Kersal Vale . 
 The archery ground became Kersal Cricket Ground in 1847 and in 1881 the Northern Tennis Tournament was staged there . In 1919 the ground became the home of Manchester 's oldest rugby club , Manchester Football Club . When Manchester F.C. moved in 1968 they were replaced briefly by Langworthy Juniors and then Salford City F.C. , who still lease the ground today . 
 = = = Public gatherings and military use = = = 
 As one of the largest open spaces close to Manchester , the moor has a history of use for army manoeuvres and large public gatherings . In his book The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 , Friedrich Engels referred to it as the Mons Sacer of Manchester . This was a reference to the hill to which the plebs ( common citizens ) of Rome withdrew en masse in 494 BC as an act of civil protest . 
 In 1789 and 1790 there had been a spate of highway and house robberies . Gangs of armed men had entered houses in the middle of the night and taken away all they could carry . Armed patrols were placed around the neighbourhood to little effect until , at last , a man named James Macnamara was arrested with three others for burglary at the Dog and Partridge Inn on Stretford Road . Macnamara was tried at Lancaster Assizes and sentenced to be hanged on Kersal Moor as a warning to other criminals . A large number of people came to watch the execution but , as Joseph Aston said in his Metrical Records of Manchester " no one could suppose that the example had any use ... as several persons had their pockets picked within sight of the gallows and the following night a house was broken into and robbed in Manchester " . 
 The Stockport , Bolton and Rochdale Volunteers were reviewed on Kersal Moor on 25 August 1797 and in June 1812 , 30 @,@ 000 troops from the Wiltshire , Buckinghamshire , Louth and Stirling regiments were camped there ready for action to suppress the Luddites . In 1818 a protest meeting was held on the moor by coal miners to publicise their case for better pay , because of the dangers they faced at work . 
 A duel was fought on the moor in July 1804 between Mr. Jones and Mr. Shakspere Philips . Mr. Jones fired at Mr. Philips without effect and Mr. Philips then fired his pistol in the air , upon which the seconds interfered , the two man shook hands and honour was satisfied . Two weeks later , two other men who had been quarrelling in the newspapers met on the moor to gain satisfaction . However , the magistrates had been informed and the men were arrested before the duel could take place . 
 On 12 April 1831 the 60th Rifle Corps had carried out an exercise on the moor under the command of Lieutenant P.S. Fitzgerald , and a detachment of 74 men were returning to their barracks in Salford by way of Lower Broughton and Pendleton . As the men were crossing the Broughton Suspension Bridge , built four years earlier by Fitzgeralds 's father , they felt it begin to vibrate in time with their footsteps , and before they had reached the other side the bridge collapsed . Although no one was killed twenty men were injured , six of them seriously . It was this incident that caused the British Military to issue the order for soldiers to " break step " when crossing a bridge . 
 The largest of a series of Chartist meetings was held on the moor on 24 September 1838 . The meeting , which was planned as a show of strength and to elect delegates for the Chartist national convention , attracted speakers from all over the country and a massive crowd , which was estimated at 30 @,@ 000 by the Manchester Guardian and 300 @,@ 000 by the Morning Advertiser . 
 The Chartists were active for the next eight months but the poor attendance at a second meeting , held on the moor at the same time as a racing fixture on 25 May 1839 , signalled the end of the movement . Although the movement was not successful initially , most of the Chartists ' demands were eventually met by Parliament . 
 In 1848 , the moor was used as an encampment for the East Norfolk Regiment as part of an increased military presence in Lancashire brought about by the unrest caused by Chartist agitation . 
 = = = Other pursuits = = = 
 As a relatively rural environment in an increasingly urbanised area , Kersal Moor was also used for more peaceful pursuits . During the 18th and 19th centuries it was much frequented by amateur naturalists and botanists . One of the botanists was Richard Buxton who went on to write A Botanical Guide to Manchester . In 1829 an amateur insect collector named Robert Cribb collected a series of about fifty small yellow and brown moths from a rotting alder on the moor . These turned out to be a previously unknown species of moth , but they were mistakenly attributed to a friend of Cribb 's , the collector R. Wood , who had asked an expert to identify them . The moths were classified as <unk> woodiella ( today <unk> woodiella ) in Wood 's honour . 
 The only specimen I have seen of this beautiful Moth , which is larger than the others , is a female ; it was taken on <unk> @-@ moor the middle of last June by Mr. R. Wood , of Manchester , to whom I have the pleasure of dedicating it ; — a most zealous and successful naturalist , to whose liberality I am indebted for many valuable insects . - John Curtis writing in British Entomology 1830 
 Enraged by this , and by accusations of fraudulently passing off foreign moths as British , Cribb gave up collecting and left the rest of the specimens with his landlady as security for a debt . Here the stories from Manchester University and The Australian Museum , Victoria differ as to whether it was Cribb 's pub landlady or the landlady of his lodgings , but either way the result was the same . The debt was not paid on time and when Cribb went back for the moths , which he had already sold to another collector , his landlady had burnt them . Subsequent efforts by other collectors to find more of the moths were unsuccessful , and the three specimens left in existence are thought to be the only representatives of an extinct species . 
 Towards the end of the 19th century a Mr. Cosmo Melvill contributed an article to the Journal of Botany in which he gave a list of more than 240 plants and flowers , not including mosses , that he had found on the moor . 
 Shortly after <unk> on 10 September 1848 the " celebrated aeronaut " George Gale ascended in a hot air balloon from Pomona Gardens in Hulme . After discharging a number of fireworks from a height of over 1 @,@ 000 feet , Lieutenant Gale drifted in various directions and made abortive attempts to land in a number of locations . Eventually , at about <unk> , the balloon descended safely in the farmyard of Mr Josiah Taylor on Kersal Moor . 
 In 1852 , Queen Victoria commissioned a painting by the artist William Wyld which became A view of Manchester from Kersal Moor ( pictured ) . The painting , which depicts the moor as a beautiful pastoral scene overlooking Castle Irwell racecourse and the industrial landscape of Manchester , is now in the Royal Collection where it is listed as Manchester from Higher Broughton . A steel line engraving of the painting by the engraver Edward Goodall was also commissioned .

 The English radical and writer Samuel Bamford mentions Kersal Moor in his book Passages in the Life of a Radical ( 1840 – 1844 ) when he advises one of his friends to make his way from Middleton to Bolton via Kersal Moor to avoid the authorities : 
 Healey I advised to go to his brother at Bolton , and get some money , and keep out of sight entirely , until something further was known . His best way would be to avoid Manchester , and go over Kersal moor and Agecroft bridge ; and as I had a relation in that quarter who wished to see me , I would keep him company as far as Agecroft . 
 The races on the moor were mentioned in the 19th @-@ century novel The Manchester Man by Mrs. G Linnaeus Banks ( 1874 ) . The hero of the story , Jabez Clegg , meets a street boy named Kit Townley , of whom Mrs. Banks says : 
 He knew him to be not over @-@ scrupulous . He had seen him at Knott Mill Fair and Dirt Fair ( so called from its being held in muddy November ) , or at Kersal Moor Races , with more money to spend in pop , nuts , and gingerbread , shows and merry @-@ go @-@ rounds , flying boats and flying boxes , fighting cocks and fighting men , than he could possibly have saved out of the sum his father allowed him for pocket @-@ money , even if he had been of the saving kind ; and , coupling all these things together , Jabez was far from satisfied . 
 It is also mentioned in a collection of poems by Philip Connell called " Poaching on Parnassus " published in 1865 . 
 Lines to Mr. Isaac Holden by Philip Connell on his Drawing of the Prestwich Lunatic Asylum : 
 And Southward at due distance the huge hive , 
 Of busy Manchester is all alive , 
 Its towering <unk> , domes and steeples rise , 
 In strange confusion thro ' the hazy skies ; 
 There Broughton glimmers in the evening sun ; 
 Here Cheetham Hill o <unk> the vapours dun ; 
 There Kersal Moor the same bleak front doth shew , 
 That met the view Eight hundred years ago , 
 Where <unk> Monks there with their God did dwell , 
 Within the precincts of its holy cell . 
 In 1876 the Lancashire dialect poet and songwriter Edwin Waugh moved from his Manchester home to Kersal Moor for the " fresher air " . Waugh 's early life was spent in Rochdale and although he worked in Manchester he yearned for the moors he remembered from his youth . He wrote the following poem about Kersal Moor 
 Kersal Moor 
 Sweet falls the blackbird 's evening song , 
 in Kersal 's poised dell ; 
 But the skylarks trill makes the dewdrops thrill , 
 In the bonny heather ; 
 Wild and free 
 Wild and free 
 Where the moorland breezes blow .
