 It was announced on August 18 , 2011 , that Scott was to direct a new Blade Runner film , with filming to begin no earlier than 2013 . Indications from producer Andrew <unk> were that Ford was unlikely to be involved in the project . Scott later said that the film was " liable to be a sequel " but without the previous cast , and that he was close to finding a writer that " might be able to help [ him ] deliver " . On February 6 , 2012 , <unk> denied that any casting considerations had been made in response to buzz that Ford might reprise his role , saying , " It is absolutely , patently false that there has been any discussion about Harrison Ford being in Blade Runner . To be clear , what we are trying to do with Ridley now is go through the painstaking process of trying to break the back of the story ... The casting of the movie could not be further from our minds at this moment . " When Scott was asked about the possibility of a sequel in October 2012 , he said , " It 's not a rumor — it 's happening . With Harrison Ford ? I don 't know yet . Is he too old ? Well , he was a Nexus @-@ 6 so we don 't know how long he can live . And that 's all I 'm going to say at this stage . " 
 In November 2014 , Variety magazine reported that Scott was no longer the director for the film and would only fulfill a producer 's role . Scott also revealed that Ford 's character will only appear in " the third act " of the sequel . In February 2015 , <unk> Entertainment confirmed that Scott will not be back to direct , and they were negotiating with Prisoners director Denis Villeneuve . Ford , however , will return , as will original writer Hampton Fancher , and the film is expected to enter production in mid @-@ 2016 . The sequel is set decades after the first film . Besides Ford , the film will also star Ryan Gosling in a currently undisclosed role . It is to be directed by Villeneuve and executive produced by Scott . Oscar @-@ nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins is also attached . On November 16 , 2015 , Gosling told Collider.com that he will be starring in the sequel . 
 Principal photography began in July 2016 . Warner Bros. will handle its domestic release , while Sony ( through Columbia Pictures ) will be releasing the film in all overseas territories . On March 31 , 2016 , Variety reported that Robin Wright was cast in a role , and in April Dave Bautista , Ana de Armas and Sylvia <unk> joined the cast . In June 2016 , Mackenzie Davis and <unk> Abdi were cast , with David Dastmalchian and Hiam Abbass joining in July . Originally slated for release in North America January 2018 , <unk> Entertainment has now set a global release for October 6 , 2017 .

 = Batman : The Ride = 
 Batman : The Ride is a steel inverted roller coaster found in Six Flags theme parks . Built by consulting engineers Bolliger & Mabillard , it rises to a height of between 100 and 105 feet ( 30 and 32 m ) and reaches top speeds of 50 miles per hour ( 80 km / h ) . The original roller coaster at Six Flags Great America was partially devised by the park 's general manager Jim Wintrode . Batman : The Ride was the world 's first inverted roller coaster when it opened in 1992 , and has since been awarded Coaster Landmark status by the American Coaster Enthusiasts . Its decorative theme is based on the first Batman film . Clones of the ride exist at amusement parks around the world . 
 = = History = = 
 The concept of an inverted roller coaster with inversions was developed by Jim Wintrode , the general manager of Six Flags Great America , in the 1990s . To develop the idea , Wintrode worked with Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard – from Swiss roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard – and engineer Robert <unk> . The ride soft opened to the public on May 2 , 1992 , with an official opening one week later . Although the full cost of the ride was never disclosed , it was the single biggest investment made by Six Flags Great America on one attraction . 
 Clones of the original ride , at Six Flags Great America in Gurnee , Illinois , became a staple at Six Flags theme parks around the world , and were opened in Six Flags Great Adventure ( 1993 ) , Six Flags Magic Mountain ( 1994 ) , and Six Flags St. Louis ( 1995 ) . Installation of the ride followed at Six Flags Over Georgia ( 1997 ) , and Six Flags Over Texas ( 1999 ) . 
 In 2002 La Ronde amusement park , Montreal , opened a clone of the ride under the name Le Vampire ( The Vampire ) , and Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid , under the name Batman : La Fuga ( Batman : The Escape ) . As La Ronde is not a branded Six Flags park , the licensing agreement with Warner Bros. and DC Comics for the name Batman : The Ride was not allowed . The La Ronde ride was expected to become Batman : The Ride when the park was scheduled to be converted to a Six Flags @-@ branded park in the mid @-@ 2000s , however , these changes were never initiated . 
 Other non @-@ Six Flags parks that installed Batman : The Ride clones are <unk> at Himeji Central Park in Japan ( 1994 ) , The Great White at SeaWorld in San Antonio , Texas ( 1997 ) , and Lightning at Entertainment City in Kuwait ( 2004 ) . 
 One of the last installations of the ride was at Six Flags New Orleans in 2003 , having been relocated from the Japanese park Thrill Valley where it operated as Gambit from 1995 to 2002 . In 2005 the effects of Hurricane Katrina caused Six Flags to abandon its New Orleans park , and after standing but not operating for two years , the ride there was relocated to Six Flags Fiesta Texas , where it was refurbished and repainted . The ride reopened as Goliath on April 18 , 2008 . 
 On February 21 , 2013 , Six Flags Great America announced that their Batman : The Ride roller coaster would run backwards for a limited time during the 2013 season . Six Flags Magic Mountain and Six Flags Over Texas did the same during the 2014 season . Six Flags Over Georgia and Six Flags Great Adventure followed suit running theirs backwards for a limited time in 2015 .

 The original installation of the ride at Six Flags Great America featured a maximum height of 100 feet ( 30 m ) while the installations to follow reached 105 feet ( 32 m ) . Each installation of Batman : The Ride has a track length of approximately 2 @,@ 700 feet ( 820 m ) . The rides reach a top speed of 50 miles per hour ( 80 km / h ) and exert up to four times the force of gravity . 
 Batman : The Ride clones operate with two steel and fiberglass trains , each containing eight cars . Each car seats four riders in a single row for a total of 32 riders per train . 
 = = = Ride layout = = = 
 The ride 's layout was specifically designed to fit in the Yankee Harbor themed area at Six Flags Great America , although the layout for each successive attraction is identical or a mirror image of the original . 
 Batman : The Ride begins with the track floor descending . The train moves out of the station and up a chain lift hill . At the top of the hill the train dips down through a Bolliger & Mabillard " kicker " , coasts down a 190 @-@ degree swoop to the left , and drops into the first 360 @-@ degree vertical loop . It then flips through a <unk> Spin to the right , followed by another vertical loop . The train then travels upward around a tight spiral to the left , then through a wider turn to the right , drops slightly , and quickly turns through the first <unk> . Following this is a tight right turn and another <unk> , then a tight left turnaround before the train enters the final brake run . 
 = = = Color scheme = = = 
 While some Batman : The Ride clones opened with dark blue track and supports , others featured gray and yellow . Over the years there have been modifications in Batman : The Ride color schemes , with more incorporating yellows , blues , and purples . The original ride at Six Flags Great America retained the original black color scheme until 2004 , when the track was painted yellow , and supports dark purple . Six Flags over Texas originally featured a black color scheme with yellow rails until 2004 , when the track was repainted yellow . For the 2010 season , the clone at Six Flags Magic Mountain was repainted medium blue with black supports .

 Six Flags designers ' decorative theme attempts to capture the spirit of Batman 's world for those queuing to board the ride . As the queue moves through Gotham City Park , the theme becomes more ominous . Modeled after Anton Furst 's award @-@ winning set design for the original Batman film , the atmosphere indicates a crime @-@ ridden and dirty environment , with wrecked cars , discarded pieces of equipment , crumbling concrete , and a Gotham City Police car riddled with bullet holes . The queue then enters the ride structure . The ride passenger loading area is modeled on Batman 's Batcave , and features a replica of the Batsuit from the 1989 film .

 M @-@ 117 is a 14 @.@ 479 @-@ mile ( 23 @.@ 302 km ) state trunkline highway in the eastern Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan . The highway connects US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) with M @-@ 28 west of Newberry . The designation has been used twice in the UP , once in 1941 for a former section of US 2 between Rexton and Epoufette , and the second in 1949 for the current corridor . The second version included a section that ran north of Newberry along what is now M @-@ 123 , but it was truncated to its current routing in the 1960s . Since 1993 , the trunkline has been dedicated to the 117th Quartermaster Battalion , a former National Guard unit from Kingsford . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The highway begins at US 2 , one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of Engadine and crosses the Canadian National Railway line before entering town . In Engadine , M @-@ 117 meets the western terminus of H @-@ 40 which runs on Hiawatha Trail . The trunkline passes a small pond in town and some farm fields north of Engadine . The terrain transitions to forest as the highway crosses into Luce County . The route angles slightly to the northeast to avoid <unk> Lake south of M @-@ 28 near Newberry . M @-@ 117 provides an important connection between two of the main highways in the UP . This connection is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . Of the ten state trunklines that connect M @-@ 28 and US 2 , M @-@ 117 is one of three that do not overlap either . The others are US 45 and Interstate 75 . 
 As part of the state 's maintenance of M @-@ 117 , the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadway . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that between 1 @,@ 392 and 1 @,@ 986 vehicles used the highway per day .

 US 2 was rerouted in 1941 between Gould City and Epoufette , with the previous routing between Epoufette and Rexton becoming a new M @-@ 117 . The route of M @-@ 117 was replaced by a realigned M @-@ 48 in 1949 . The M @-@ 117 designation was transferred to a new routing between Engadine and Newberry at that time , and extended east concurrent along M @-@ 28 and north through Newberry on Business M @-@ 28 ( BUS M @-@ 28 ) , replacing a section of M @-@ 48 . North of town , M @-@ 117 extended past BUS M @-@ 28 to Four Mile Corner along the former M @-@ 48 . 
 M @-@ 117 in Mackinac County was shifted to a new routing along Country Avenue in 1957 . The previous routing was transferred to local control at the same time . M @-@ 117 was truncated to M @-@ 28 west of Newberry in late 1961 or early 1962 . The section of highway north of M @-@ 28 through Newberry to Four Mile Corner was included in an extension of M @-@ 123 between Newberry and Paradise .

 = Poland in Antiquity = 
 Poland in Antiquity is characterized by peoples belonging to numerous archeological cultures living in and migrating through various parts of the territory that now constitutes Poland in an era that dates from about 400 BC to 450 – 500 AD . These people are identified as Celtic , Germanic , Baltic and Thracian tribes . Other groups , difficult to identify , were most likely also present , as ethnic composition of archeological cultures is often poorly recognized . While lacking use of a written language to any appreciable degree , many of them developed relatively advanced material culture and social organization , as evidenced by the archeological record , for example judged by the presence of richly furnished , dynastic " princely " graves . Characteristic of the period was high geographical migration rate of large groups of people , even equivalents of today 's nations . This article covers the continuation of the Iron Age ( see Bronze and Iron Age Poland ) , the La Tène and Roman influence and Migration periods . La Tène period is subdivided into La Tène A , 450 to 400 BC ; La Tène B , 400 to 250 BC ; La Tène C , 250 to 150 BC ; La Tène D , 150 to 0 BC . 400 to 200 BC is also considered the early pre @-@ Roman period and 200 to 0 BC the younger pre @-@ Roman period ( A ) . It was followed by the period of Roman influence , of which the early stage had lasted from 0 to 150 AD ( 0 – 80 B1 , 80 – 150 B2 ) , and the late stage from 150 to 375 AD ( 150 – 250 C1 , 250 – 300 C2 , 300 – 375 C3 ) . 375 to 500 AD constituted the ( pre @-@ Slavic ) Migration Period ( D and E ) . 
 The Celtic peoples established a number of settlement centers , beginning in the early 4th century BC , mostly in southern Poland , which was at the outer edge of their expansion . Through their highly developed economy and crafts , they exerted lasting cultural influence disproportional to their small numbers in the region . 
 Expanding and moving out of their homeland in Scandinavia and northern Germany , the Germanic peoples had lived in today 's Poland for several centuries , during which period many of their tribes also migrated out in the southern and eastern directions ( see Wielbark culture ) . With the expansion of the Roman Empire , the Germanic tribes came under the Roman cultural influence . Some written remarks by Roman authors that are relevant to the developments on Polish lands have been preserved ; they provide additional insight when compared with the archeological record . In the end , as the Roman Empire was nearing its collapse and the nomadic peoples invading from the east destroyed , damaged or destabilized the various Germanic cultures and societies , the Germanic people left eastern and central Europe for the safer and wealthier southern and western parts of the European continent . 
 The northeast corner of contemporary Poland 's territory was and remained populated by Baltic tribes . They were at the outer limits of significant cultural influence of the Roman Empire . 
 = = Celtic peoples = = 
 = = = Archeological cultures and groups = = = 
 The first Celtic people arrived in Poland , coming from Bohemia and Moravia , around or after 400 BC , just a few decades after their La Tène culture was born . They formed several enclaves mostly in the southern part of the country , within the Pomeranian or Lusatian populations or in areas abandoned by those people . The cultures or groups that were Celtic , or had a Celtic element in them ( mixed Celtic and autochthonous ) , lasted at their furthest extent to 170 AD ( the Púchov culture ) . After the Celts moved in , and during their tenure ( they had always remained only a small minority ) , the bulk of the population had begun acquiring the traits of archaeological cultures with a dominant Proto @-@ Germanic or Germanic component . In Europe the expansion of Rome and the Germanic pressure checked and reversed the Celtic expansion . 
 At first two groups established themselves on fertile grounds in Silesia : One on the left bank of the Oder River south of Wrocław , in the area that included Mount Ślęża , and one around the Głubczyce highlands ; both stayed in their respective regions during the 400 – 120 BC period . Burial and other significant Celtic sites in Głubczyce County were investigated in <unk> and nearby Nowa Cerekiew . The Ślęża group disintegrated eventually within the local population , while the one at Głubczyce Upland apparently migrated out in the southern direction . More recent discoveries include Celtic settlements in Wrocław County , where in <unk> a well @-@ preserved 3rd century BC grave of a woman with bronze and iron bracelets , brooches , rings and chains was found . 
 In another hundred years or more two groups arrived and settled the upper San River basin ( 270 – 170 BC ) and the Kraków area respectively . This last one , together with the local population developing at about that time the Przeworsk culture characteristics ( see the next section ) , formed the mixed Tyniec group , in existence 270 – 30 BC . The rise of the Tyniec group took place in particular about 80 – 70 BC , when the existing settlements received Celtic reinforcements from the more southern populations being displaced from Slovakia by the Dacians . In the 1st century BC another small group settled probably much further north , in Kujawy . And finally there was the long @-@ lasting ( 270 BC - 170 AD ) mixed Púchov culture , associated based on Roman sources with the Celtic <unk> , whose northern reaches included parts of the Beskids mountain range and even the Kraków area . 
 = = = Economy and crafts , trade and contacts , art = = = 
 The Celts practiced advanced agriculture and favored fertile lands ; they brought with them and disseminated the inventions , including a variety of tools , and other achievements of La Tène culture . Celtic farmers used plows with iron shares and fertilized fields with animal manure . Their livestock consisted of selected breeds , especially sheep and large cattle . The rotational querns that they invented had a stationary lower stone and an upper one rotated by a lever . Iron was obtained in greater quantities from locally available turf ores ; its metallurgy and processing were improved , resulting in the manufacturing of stronger and more resistant tools and weapons . The ceramic shops used the potter 's wheel and produced with great precision ( especially the Tyniec group ) baked , thin walled , painted vessels , one of the best in Europe . Domed bilevel furnaces were used , the pots being placed on a perforated clay shelf , with the hearth underneath . Glass and enamel were produced , gold and semi @-@ precious stones were processed for jewelry . 
 The Celtic communities kept extensive trade contacts with the Greek cities , Etruria and then Rome . They were involved in the amber trade , whose route ran between the Baltic and Adriatic seas , but amber was also worked on in local shops . Metal coins were used and minted ( made of gold and silver in addition to the more common metals ) around Kraków in the 1st century BC and elsewhere . In <unk> near Oświęcim a whole treasure of Celtic coins was discovered . Original Celtic art found its expression in numerous decorations , where plant , animal and anthropomorphic motifs were used . The various Celtic achievements were adopted by the native populations , but usually with considerable delay . 
 = = = Prominent settlements and burial sites = = = 
 The settlement in Nowa Cerekiew functioned from the beginning of 4th to the end of the 2nd century BC . One hundred people lived in over twenty houses supported by pillars , with walls made of beams , finished with clay and painted . They were positioned on an elevated area , but the Celtic settlements in Poland had no defensive reinforcements . After the Celts evacuated the area the Nowa Cerekiew settlement remained uninhabited for 150 years , before being reoccupied by the Przeworsk culture people and later the Slavs . Objects recently found at Nowa Cerekiew include a collection of gold and silver coins minted by the <unk> tribe ( 3rd - 2nd century BC ) , Greek coins from Sicily and other colonies , and various metal decorative items . Clay containers , jewelry and tools were recovered in the past . Nowa Cerekiew was a major Celtic trade and political centre , one of the very few in central Europe , a source of great profits and northernmost of their Amber Road stations . 
 Among the most significant Celtic finds in Lesser Poland are the extensive and wealthy settlement in Podłęże and its associated cemetery in <unk> , both in Wieliczka County , and a multi @-@ period settlement complex in Aleksandrowice , Kraków County . The Podłęże site was occupied from the mid @-@ 3rd century BC on and yielded many metal objects , coins and coin blank molds , large collection of glass bracelets . The <unk> Celtic graves have the form of large ( several metres long ) dugout rectangular enclosures containing the ashes and grave offerings , such as pottery and personal ornaments . Graves of the same type but of a later period , 1st to 2nd century AD , are also found around Kraków , which demonstrates continuation of the Celtic tradition even after the arrival of Germanic tribes in the area . The Celtic burial site investigated in Aleksandrowice contains a rich 2nd century BC assemblage of funerary gifts including iron weapons and decorative elements . The unique fancy decorations , including a sheath with a recurring dragon motif , relate the findings only to the Celtic settlement area in Slovenia and western Croatia . 
 = = = Spiritual life and cult sites = = = 
 Within the Celtic spiritual sphere there is considerable variation . The 4th and early 3rd century BC burials in Wrocław and Ślęża region are skeletal . Sometimes a man and a woman were buried together , suggesting the known Celtic practice of killing the wife during her husband 's funeral , but women were usually buried separately , with their jewelry . Some of the dead were given meat and a knife for cutting it . From the 3rd century on the bodies were cremated , which was also the case in all of the Lesser Poland burials . There in <unk> the graves of Celtic warriors ( 3rd century BC ) contain a very rich assortment of weapons and decorations . 
 Mount Ślęża formation is believed by many to have been a place of exceptional cult significance , over many centuries , possibly going back all the way to the Lusatian times , but especially for the Celts . Chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg mentions in the early 11th century the mountain as a place surrounded by adoration because of its size and the " cursed " pagan ceremonies carried out there . The summits of this and of the neighboring mountains are circled by stone rings and monumental sculptures . <unk> cross signs found on many of the stone objects may have had their origin in the Hallstatt - Lusatian solar cult . Such signs can also be seen on the massive " monk " stone sculpture ( actually looking more like a simple chess figure or a skittles pin ) that was located inside the largest stone ring on Mount Ślęża itself and is therefore believed to originate from the Hallstatt cultural circles . The stone rings also contain fragments of Lusatian ceramics . The younger sculptures ( " Maiden with a fish " , " Mushroom " and the bear figures ) have their distant counterparts in the Iberian Peninsula Celtic art and are thought to be the work of the Celtic people , who developed the Ślęża cult center further . After that the Mount Ślęża area cult was probably revived by the Slavs , who arrived here in early Middle Ages .

 = = = La Tène and Jastorf cultures and their role = = = 
 The Proto @-@ Germanic or Germanic cultures on Polish lands developed gradually and in a diverse way , beginning with the old local Lusatian and Pomeranian stock , influenced and augmented first by La Tène culture and the Celtic people , and then by the Jastorf culture and its tribes , which settled northwestern Poland beginning in the 4th century BC , and later migrated in the southeastern direction through and past the main stretch of Polish lands ( mid @-@ 3rd century BC and afterwards ) . The disappearing Celtic people made a big impact in central Europe and left a lasting legacy . Their advanced culture catalyzed economic and other progress within the contemporary as well as future populations , which had often had little of no ethnic Celtic component . The archeological period is considered " La Tène " until the beginning of the Common Era . The beginnings of the powerful ascent of the Germanic people , who replaced the Celts , are not easy to discern ( e.g. to what degree the Pomeranian culture lands became the Przeworsk culture lands by internal evolution , external population influx or just permeation by the new regional cultural trends ) . 
 The early Germanic Jastorf cultural sphere was in the beginning an impoverished continuation of the North German <unk> culture and the Nordic circle cultures . It formed around 700 – 550 BC in northern Germany and Jutland under the Hallstatt influence and in Jastorf 's early stages its funeral customs resembled a lot those of the contemporary Pomeranian culture . From the Jastorf culture , which rapidly expanded from around 500 BC on , two groups sprang and settled the western borderlands of Poland during the 300 – 100 BC period : The Oder group in western Pomerania and the Gubin group further south . These peripheral for the Jastorf culture groups very likely originated as Pomeranian culture populations influenced by the Jastorf cultural model . Jastorf communities established large burial grounds , separate for men and women . The dead were cremated and the ashes placed in urns , which were covered by bowls turned upside down . Funeral gifts were modest and rather uniform , indicating a society that was neither affluent nor socially diversified . 
 The above @-@ mentioned migration was undertaken by a part of the Jastorf population , which probably included the tribes later called Bastarnae and <unk> in Greek written sources , noted because of their military exploits around Greece and Greek colonies in the later part of the 3rd century BC . Their route went along the Warta and Noteć rivers , then crossed Kujawy and Masovia , turned south along the Bug River and continued on to what today is Moldavia , where they settled and developed the <unk> @-@ <unk> culture . The route is marked by archeological findings , especially the characteristic bronze crown @-@ shaped necklaces . 
 = = = Oksywie culture and Przeworsk culture = = = 
 While it is not clear whether , and to what degree or for what duration some of the passing Jastorf culture people settled at that time on Polish lands , their migration catalyzed , together with the accelerated at this point La Tène culture influence , the emergence of the Oksywie and Przeworsk cultures . Both new cultures were under a strong Jastorf circles influence . The increasingly common within the Przeworsk culture area presence of objects made by the Jastorf people reflects penetration by their population . Both the Oksywie and Przeworsk cultures fully utilized iron processing technologies , and , unlike their predecessor cultures , they show no regional differentiation . 
 The Oksywie culture , so named after a village ( now within the city of Gdynia ) where a burial site was found , lasted from 250 BC to 30 AD and originally occupied the Vistula delta region , then the rest of eastern Pomerania , expanded west up to the Jastorf Oder group area , in the 1st century BC also including partially what was before that group 's territory . It had basically , like other cultures of this period , La Tène cultural characteristics , with traits typical of the Baltic cultures . Oksywie culture 's ceramics and burial customs indicate strong ties with the Przeworsk culture . Men only had their ashes placed in well made black urns with fine finish and a decorative band around . Their graves were supplied ( unlike those of the Jastorf culture ) with utensils and weapons , including typical for this culture swords with one @-@ sided edge , and were often covered or marked by stones . Women 's ashes were buried in hollows and supplied with feminine items . A clay vessel with relief animal images found in <unk> Wielkie in Gdańsk County ( 2nd half of the 1st century BC ) is among the finest in all of the Germanic cultural zone . 
 The Przeworsk culture , named after a town in Lesser Poland , near which another burial ground was found , originated like the Oksywie culture around 250 BC , but lasted a long time . In its course it went through many changes , formed tribal and political structures , fought wars , also with the Romans , until in the 5th century AD its highly developed society of farmers , artisans , warriors and chiefs left for the temptations of the fallen empire lands ( for many of them it happened possibly rather quickly , during the first half of that century ) . 
 The Przeworsk culture initially became established in Lower Silesia , Greater Poland , central Poland , and western Masovia and Lesser Poland , gradually replacing , moving eastbound , the Pomeranian culture and the Cloche Grave culture , coexisting with the older cultures for a while ( in some cases well into the younger pre @-@ Roman period , 200 to 0 BC ) and assimilating in process some of their characteristics , for example the Cloche Grave funerary practice and ceramics . The Przeworsk people must have originated from the above two local cultures , because of the lack of any other archeologically viable possibility , but in respect to their predecessors they represent a striking cultural discontinuity ( different cremation rite and pottery ) . 
 In the 2nd and 1st century BC ( late La Tène period ) they followed the lead of the more advanced Celts , who had established population enclaves in southern and middle Poland . The Przeworsk culture developed as a result of the local populations ' adoption of the La Tène culture models . The passage of the Bastarnae and <unk> and the associated unrest likely functioned as the outside catalyzing agent : Jastorf culture archeological material has been found in pre @-@ Przeworsk artifact assemblages and in some of the early Przeworsk range . The Przeworsk people mastered and implemented the various achievements of the Celts , most importantly developing large scale production of iron . Local bog ores were used for that purpose . They sometimes formed mixed groups and cooperated within common settlements with the Celts , of which the Tyniec group in the Kraków region and another one in Kujawy are the known examples . Arms , clothes and ornaments were patterned after the Celtic products . In the early stages the Przeworsk people displayed no social distinction , their graves were alike and flat , and ashes together with funeral gifts buried usually without urns . Religious practices of pagan Germanic people included offering ceremonies performed in swamp areas , involving man @-@ made objects , produce , farm animals , or even human sacrifice , as was the case at a site near <unk> in <unk> County ; another such investigated site is in <unk> , Grójec County . Dog burials within or around a homestead were another form of protective offerings . 
 As the Celtic domination in this part of Europe was coming to an end and the borders of the Roman Empire had gotten much closer , the Przeworsk culture people were being subjected to the Greco @-@ Roman world 's influence with a rapidly growing intensity . 
 = = Cultures and tribes in Roman times = = 
 = = = Early Roman wars and movement of tribes = = = 
 Much circumstantial evidence points to the participation of Germanic people from Polish lands in the events that took place in the first half of the 1st century BC and found their culmination in Gaul in 58 BC , as related in Caesar 's Commentarii de Bello Gallico . At the time of the Suebi tribal confederation led by <unk> arrival in Gaul , a rapid decrease of settlement density can be observed in the areas of the upper and middle Oder River basin . In fact the Gubin group of the Jastorf culture disappeared then entirely , which may indicate this group 's identity with one of the Suebi tribes . The western regions of the Przeworsk culture were also vacated ( Lower Silesia , Lubusz Land and western Greater Poland ) , which is where the tribes accompanying the Suebi tribes must have come from . Burial sites and artifacts characteristic of the Przeworsk culture have been found in Saxony , Thuringia and Hesse , on the route of the Suebi offensive . The above @-@ mentioned regions of western Poland had not become repopulated and economically developed again until in the 2nd century AD . 
 As a result of the consequent Roman efforts to subjugate all of Germania , the member tribes of the Suebi alliance became displaced , moved east , conquered the Celtic tribes that stood in their way and settled , the Quadi in Moravia , and the Marcomanni in Bohemia . The latter tribe , under <unk> , formed a quasi @-@ state with a huge army and was able to conquer the Lugii tribal association among others . What archeologists see as the Przeworsk culture , by this period ( early 1st century AD ) is believed to consist first of all of the Lugii tribes . A Roman defeat in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest ( 9 AD ) stabilized the situation at the periphery of the Empire to some degree . The Lugii and other tribes on Polish lands increasingly became involved in trade and other contacts , through the Marcomanni and Quadi intermediaries , with the Danubian provinces of Rome . The Lugii , according to Tacitus , was a very large union of tribes . In 50 AD they invaded and pillaged the Quadi state created by Vannius , contributing to its fall . The motivation for the expedition were the rumours of the enormous riches that Vannius had accumulated by plunder and charging duties . In 93 AD the Lugii , fighting a war with the Suebi , asked Emperor Domitian for help , and received one hundred mounted soldiers . 
 = = = Amber Road = = = 
 Operations of the ancient Amber Road - a trans @-@ European , north @-@ south amber trade route , continued and intensified during the Roman Empire times . From the 1st century BC the Amber Road connected the Baltic Sea shores and Aquileia , an important amber processing center . This route was controlled first by the Celts , and later by the Romans south of the Danube , by Germanic tribes north of that river , and was used for transporting a variety of traded merchandise ( and slaves ) besides amber . As told in Naturalis Historia by Pliny the Elder , during the reign of Nero an equestrian of unknown name led an expedition to the Baltic shorelines , from where he brought a huge quantity of amber , which was subsequently used for propaganda purposes during public games - gladiator fights . The infrastructure of the Amber Road was destroyed by Germanic and Sarmatian attacks in the second half of the 3rd century AD ; to a lesser degree it was still used intermittently until the mid @-@ 6th century . The Przeworsk culture sites provide a rich assortment of Amber Road traded objects . 
 = = = Gustow group and Lubusz group = = = 
 From the beginning of the new era until 140 AD two local groups existed in northwest Poland . The Gustow group ( named after Gustow on Rügen ) people lived in the area settled in the past by the Oder group , and south of there , by the middle section of the Oder River was the Lubusz group , in the area previously inhabited by the Gubin group . Those were of an intermediate character , between the Elbe cultural circle to the west , and the Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures to the east ( the last one replaced the Oksywie culture after 30 AD ) . 
 = = = Przeworsk culture settlements and burial sites = = = 
 The Przeworsk culture people of the earlier Roman period lived in small , unprotected villages , populated each by a few dozen residents at most , made up of several houses , usually set partially below the ground level ( semi @-@ sunken ) , each covering an area of 8 – 22 square meters . They knew how to dig and build wells , so the settlements didn 't have to be located near bodies of water . Thirteen 2nd century wells with variously constructed timber lined walls were found at a settlement in <unk> , Bochnia County . Fields were being used for crop cultivation for a while and then as pastures , when animal excrement helped the soil regain fertility . Once iron share plows were introduced the fields were alternated between tillage and grazing . 
 Several or more settlements made up a micro @-@ region , within which the residents cooperated economically and buried their dead in a common cemetery , but which was separated from other micro @-@ regions by undeveloped areas . A number of such micro @-@ regions possibly made up a tribe , with these separated by empty space , zones " of mutual fear " , as Tacitus put it . The tribes in turn , especially if they were culturally closely related , would at times form larger structures , such as temporary alliances for waging wars , or even early statehood forms . 
 A Przeworsk culture turn of the millennium industrial complex for the extraction of salt from salt springs was discovered in <unk> near <unk> . 
 Examinations of the burial grounds , of which even the largest used continuously over periods of up to several centuries , contains no more than several hundreds graves , shows that the overall population density was low . The dead were cremated and the ashes sometimes placed in urns , which had the mid @-@ part in the form of an engraved bulge . In the 1st century AD this was replaced with a sharp @-@ profiled ( with a horizontal ridge around the circumference ) shape . 
 In <unk> a grave of a warrior who must have taken part in the <unk> expedition during the 70 – 50 BC period was found ; it contains Celtic weapons and an Alpine region manufactured helmet used as an urn , together with local ceramics . The burial gifts were often , for unknown reasons , bent or broken , and then burned with the body . The burials range from " poor " to " rich " , the latter ones supplied with fancy Celtic and then Roman imports , reflecting a considerably by this time developed social stratification . 
 = = = Wielbark culture and its burials = = = 
 The Wielbark culture , named after Wielbark in Malbork County , where a large cemetery was found , replaced in Pomerania the Oksywie culture rather suddenly and over its entire territory . While the Oksywie culture was closely related to the Przeworsk culture , its successor the Wielbark culture shows only minimal contacts with the Przeworsk areas , indicating a clear tribal and geographical separation . The Wielbark culture lasted on Polish lands from 30 to 400 AD , although most of its people left Poland long before that later date . Some of this culture 's burials are skeletal - the dead were inhumed in solid wood log coffins , while other <unk> , both identically equipped . The cremated remains were either placed in urns , or just buried in dents . No weapons or tools were put there , but clay vessels , decorations , attire elements and spurs , if the deceased was well @-@ positioned enough to possess a horse . Those various items , and especially the 1st and 2nd century AD jewelry , made of bronze , silver and gold , are the works of highest quality and exceed the comparable products of the Przeworsk culture . This craftsmanship reached its apex in the 2nd century finesse of " baroque " jewelry , beautiful by any standards , placed in graves of women in ( as the Wielbark culture expanded south ) Poznań <unk> and Kowalewko , <unk> County , among other places . 
 The Kowalewko cemetery in Greater Poland is one of the largest in Poland and is distinguished by a great number of beautiful relics , made locally or imported from the Empire . The total number of burials is estimated at over 500 , most of which have been excavated . 60 percent of the bodies were not cremated and typically placed in wooden coffins constructed of board or plank pieces . The burial ground was in use from the mid @-@ 1st century AD to about 220 , which gives approximately 80 area inhabitants per generation . Remnants of settlements in the region have also been investigated . At <unk> near Chełmno a Wielbark settlement , an industrial production site and a 2nd to 3rd century bi @-@ ritual cemetery with very richly furnished graves have been discovered . In the area of <unk> , Gdańsk County a settlement consisting of both sunken floor and post construction dwellings , as well as a burial ground in use from the mid @-@ 1st century to the second half of the 3rd century were found . Only a part of the cemetery was excavated on the occasion of a motorway construction , but it yielded 110 inhumations ( 11 in hollowed @-@ out log coffins ) and 15 cremations ( 8 of them in urns ) and a rich collection of decorative objects , mostly from the graves of women . Those include fancy jewelry and accessories made of gold , silver , bronze , amber , glass and enameled plates . Ceramics , utility items and tools including weaving equipment were recovered from the settlement site . Other significant Wielbark settlements in the area were encountered in <unk> and <unk> , both in Tczew County . 
 Many Wielbark graves were flat , but kurgans are also characteristic and common . In the case of kurgans the grave was covered with stones , which were surrounded by a circle made of larger stones . More earth material was piled to cover all that , with a solitary stone , or stela often put on top . Such a kurgan could include one or several individual burials , have a diameter of up to a dozen or so meters and be up to one meter high . On some burial grounds large stone circles are found . These consist of massive boulders or rock pieces , up to 1 @.@ 7 meters high , separated by several meters wide spaces , sometimes connected by smaller stones , the whole structure having a 10 to 40 meter diameter . In the middle of the circles one to four stelae were placed , and sometimes a single grave . The stone circles are believed to be the locations of meetings of Scandinavian ( see below ) <unk> - assemblies or courts . The single graves inside the circles are probably of people sacrificed and buried there - human offerings to the gods , to assure their support for the deliberations . A stone kurgans cemetery was found in <unk> , <unk> County ; another burial site with ten large stone circles was discovered in <unk> , <unk> County , both dated 2nd century AD . 
 = = = Origins and expansion of the Wielbark culture = = = 
 This brings the issue of the mysterious origin of the Wielbark culture , and why it so immediately replaced the Oksywie culture . According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes , the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia ( under King <unk> ) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores , followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids . Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region , and then , some years later ( under King <unk> , the fifth one counting from <unk> ) , continued their migration toward the Black Sea . This story , in the past dismissed , is now seen as containing basic elements of the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic ancestors of the Goths indeed . The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region of culturally different ( although related ) people , who mixed with the Oksywie culture population , and being more advanced possibly dominated it ( at least culturally ) to some degree , is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD . 
 Archeology nevertheless shows the evolution of the Oksywie culture to be the fundamental source of the Wielbark culture , as the two cultures extended over exactly the same territory and continuously used the same cemeteries . The locally present Veneti and <unk> became influenced by the Goths or their Scandinavian protoplasts . It is presently believed that the Scandinavian arrivals directly settled the areas where the great cult kurgan and stone burial grounds are found . They are referred to as the <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> type , were established in the second half of 1st century AD and occur in parts of Pomerania west of the Vistula , up to the <unk> area . The contemporary and rather closely related Wielbark culture in ( previously settled by the Przeworsk culture ) Greater Poland , represented by the Kowalewko cemetery , lacks however for the most part the kurgans and the stone structures . The Wielbark people came here from Pomerania . 
 In the course of the 1st and 2nd century AD the Wielbark culture expanded south , towards Greater Poland and Masovia , partially at the expense of the Przeworsk culture . Around the mid @-@ 1st century the Wielbark culture people forced out the Przeworsk population from northern Greater Poland and settled the area for about 150 years . The Przeworsk culture itself also expanded in the southern , eastern and south @-@ western directions . 
 = = " Barbarians " , Late Roman Empire and the Great Migration of Peoples = = 
 = = = Marcomannic Wars and movement of tribes = = = 
 The Marcomannic Wars fought during 166 – 180 AD were caused by the pressure exerted by the northern Germanic peoples ( settled around the area of today 's Poland ) on the tribes located in the vicinity of Roman limes , the Empire 's defended border . Expansion of the Proto @-@ Gothic Wielbark culture displaced from northern Greater Poland and Masovia the Przeworsk culture people ; they in turn , moving south and east , crossed during the third quarter of the 2nd century the Carpathian Mountains . The ethnic composition of the Przeworsk population at this stage is not known , as the Lugii tribes no longer seem to be mentioned . Related to the Przeworsk culture was the <unk> @-@ Solina type , a cultural unit with Celtic and then Dacian elements , situated within the more eastern part of the Beskids range ( San River basin ) during the 100 – 250 AD period . The <unk> tribe Celtic survivors with their Púchov culture disappeared now for good , as a result of their migration and involvement in the Marcomannic Wars . There were also changes in northwest Poland , on the border of the Elbe cultural sphere region . The Lubusz group there was absorbed by the new <unk> culture ( <unk> , Krosno <unk> County ) , that occupied the middle Oder basin during the 140 – 430 AD period . Its birth was related to the arrival from the east of population groups strongly influenced by the Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures . Gradually a new branch of Germanic people , the Burgundians , whose origins are traced back to Scandinavia and the Bornholm island in particular and whose ancestors then migrated to the northwest <unk> culture area , developed and evolved under new favorable conditions here . On the other hand , the Gustow group left western Pomerania , to be replaced after 70 years by the Dębczyn group ( Dębczyn , Wschowa County ) , established by the arrivals from the Elbe cultures and lasting between 210 and 450 AD . 
 = = = Economic development and currency = = = 
 The economic development of what to the Romans were barbarian lands ( also called " Barbaricum " , regions populated mostly by Germanic peoples , north and northeast of the Empire ) benefited greatly from the skills of the prisoners taken during the protracted Marcomannic Wars , Roman legionaries and craftsmen , some of whom undoubtedly stayed beyond the limes and made their contribution there . Contacts with the wealthy Danubian Roman provinces during the wars were also quite active and intensive . Because of all that , from the end of the 2nd century AD on , the Roman @-@ originated and based technical expertise and inventions were becoming increasingly widespread within the Germanic societies . For example , besides traditional houses supported by pillars , framework houses were being built , lathe machines were used for amber and other jewelry work . The barbarian societies were getting more wealthy and , especially during the last centuries of imperial Rome , more socially polarized . 
 An estimated 70 @,@ 000 Roman coins from all periods were found in Poland , starting with the 2nd century BC silver denarii . A treasure of these and other coins , some as early as the 1st century AD , was found in Połaniec , <unk> County , probably a booty captured around 19 AD from King <unk> of the Marcomanni . Greater waves of Roman money found their way to Poland throughout 1st and 2nd centuries and then again during 4th and 5th centuries , this time as bronze and golden solidi . The barbarians did not use them for commerce ; they were being accumulated in dynastic treasuries of rulers and occasionally used for ceremonial gift exchange . The chiefs also kept large golden Roman medallions or their local imitations . The largest barbarian medallion , an equivalent of 48 <unk> , is a part of the gold and silver treasure found in <unk> near Kalisz . 
 = = = Princely burials = = = 
 The evolution of the power structure within the Germanic societies in Poland and elsewhere can be traced to some degree by examining the " princely " graves - burials of chiefs , and even hereditary princes , as the consolidation of power progressed . Those appear from the beginning of the Common Era and are located away from ordinary cemeteries , singly or in small groups . The bodies were inhumed in wooden coffins and covered with kurgans , or interred in wooden or stone chambers . Luxurious Roman @-@ made gifts and fancy barbarian emulations ( such as silver and gold clasps with springs , created with an unsurpassed attention to detail , dated 3rd century AD from Wrocław Zakrzów ) , but not weapons , were placed in the graves . The 1st and 2nd century burials of this type , occurring all the way from Jutland to Lesser Poland , are referred to as princely graves <unk> type , after <unk> , <unk> County in western Pomerania , where six such burials were found . On the 3rd and 4th century sites two types of princely graves are distinguished . The Zakrzów type , named after the location of three very rich stone chamber burials found in Wrocław Zakrzów occur in southern Poland , while in the northern and central parts of the country the <unk> ( Białystok County ) type kurgans are rather common . At some sites , believed to be dynastic necropolises , the princes were buried in generation long time increments . During the late Roman period the princely burials are fewer in number , but they get increasingly more elaborate . 
 = = = Ceramics and metallurgy = = = 
 The pottery as well as iron mining and processing industries kept developing in Poland throughout the Roman periods , until terminated in the 5th century or so by the Great Migration . Clay pots were still often formed manually and these were more crude , while the better ones were made with the potter 's wheel , used beginning in the early 3rd century . Some had inscriptions engraved , but their meaning , if any , is not known ( Germanic people had occasionally used the runic alphabets ) . Wide @-@ open , vase type Przeworsk culture urn from the 2nd century AD found in Biała , <unk> County is covered with representations from Celtic and Germanic mythology , such as deer , horse riders , crosses and swastikas . The 3rd and 4th century buckets were made of wood and reinforced with bronze braces and sheets . Przeworsk culture 's large globular clay storage containers from the 3rd and 4th century were 60 cm to over one meter tall . The 4th and 5th century ceramic specimens from the late phase of this culture include pitchers , clay pails , beakers and bowls . 
 Characteristic of the Roman times iron industry were huge centers of metallurgy . One such concentration of ironworks , in Świętokrzyskie Mountains , which already produced iron on an industrial scale in the 1st century AD , in the 2nd and 3rd centuries became Barbaricum 's largest . It may have been responsible for the majority of the iron supplied for barbarian weapon production during the Marcomannic Wars . The iron product was obtained in rather small , single @-@ use smelting furnaces . One furnace 's iron output was from a few to 20 kg , which required 10 to 200 kg of ore and the same amount of charcoal . The satisfaction of so much need for charcoal caused significant deforestation of the areas surrounding the iron centers . Not only turf , but also hematite ores were utilized , which involved building mines and shafts to provide access . The furnaces in Świętokrzyskie Mountains were grouped into large complexes , located in forested areas , away from human settlements . There could have had been as many as 700 @,@ 000 smelting furnaces built in that area ; one big concentration of the Przeworsk culture 's spent furnaces ( 2nd @-@ 3rd centuries ) was located in Nowa <unk> , Kielce County . The second largest iron production center functioned at that time in Masovia , west of Warsaw , with the total number of furnaces there , in which only turf ores were used , estimated at up to 200 @,@ 000 . They were operated as very large complexes , with several thousand furnaces at a time located near populated areas , where intermediate products were processed further . Those two great concentrations of metallurgical industry produced iron largely for long distance trade ; to fulfill local requirements and on smaller scale iron was obtained at a number of other locations . 
 Graves of warrior @-@ smiths buried with weapons and sets of tools were found , which suggests that they belonged to the societal upper ranks and were held in high esteem . 
 = = = Weapons and tools = = = 
 A set of iron carpenter 's tools from the 3rd @-@ 4th century , including a compass for marking circles , was found in <unk> , Wieluń County , where there was a Przeworsk culture settlement and a 2nd / 3rd century dynastic burial complex . The graves of Przeworsk men typically include substantial collections of arms , so that their warrior 's battle equipment and its evolution are well known . Less wealthy warriors fought typically on foot , with spears ( for close range combat ) and javelins ( for throwing ) , both with iron heads . The better off fighters used swords , first of the long Celtic kind , and then in the 1st and 2nd century AD of the short and broad , gladius Roman infantry type . Swords were kept in sheaths , some of which , depending on status , were very ornate . The long and narrow swords , better suited for horseback combat , became popular again in the 3rd century , but only the more wealthy warriors had horses , nor to mention iron helmets or ring armor . Round wooden shields had iron <unk> in the middle , usually with a thorn for piercing the enemy . There were no saddles , but the richest of horsemen used silver spurs and bronze bridles with chain reins . Numerous Przeworsk culture objects including spurs and a unique silver belt buckle were recovered at the Aleksandrowice , Kraków County settlement area ; some relics there are dated possibly as late as the first half of the 6th century . 
 = = = Migrations of Wielbark and Przeworsk cultures people = = = 
 In the 2nd century AD the Proto @-@ Gothic people of the Wielbark culture began their own great migration , moving east , south and south @-@ east . In the first half of the 3rd century they left most of Pomerania except for the lower Vistula region , where a small Wielbark population remained ; Pomerania west of there became mostly settled by the Dębczyn group . Also evacuated at that time northern Greater Poland was retaken by the Przeworsk culture people . The Wielbark people successively took over eastern Masovia , Lesser Poland , Podlasie , Polesie and Volhynia . They settled in Ukraine , where they encountered other peoples , which resulted in the early 3rd century AD in the rise of the Chernyakhov culture . This last culture , which in the 4th century encompassed large areas of southeastern Europe , was of a mixed ethnic composition ; in the more western part it was made @-@ up of the Wielbark culture people , as well as other Germanic people and the Dacians . It was within the Chernyakhov culture that the Gothic tribes assumed their mature form . 
 The Przeworsk culture populations were for the most part also moving ( to a lesser extent ) south and east , which by the 4th century caused a lessening of the population density in northern and central Poland with a simultaneous settlement concentration increases in Lesser Poland and Silesia . The Przeworsk people there at this point in time are often identified with the Vandals Germanic tribe . The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies had to cope with a deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure , caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence in the hands of the rich , the warriors , the tribal elders and rulers , who controlled the trade , imposed contributions and plundered . During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases . There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited , which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave . Most burials were getting more poorly equipped , in comparison with the previous periods . Late Przeworsk culture ceramic materials from Greater Poland show impoverishment and lack of differentiation of form , but on the other hand metal 5th century clasps , found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland , through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy , demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies highest quality of workmanship . 
 = = = Hun advance , barbarian migrations in Europe = = = 
 On top of the Przeworsk culture 's internal crisis situation came external pressures , namely the massive migration of peoples . At around 370 AD the Huns crossed the Volga River , defeating the Alans and then the Ostrogoths , causing in 375 the fall of their state located in the Black Sea shores region . This unleashed a domino effect , as various Germanic peoples moved west and south to avoid the danger . The Visigoths and others retreated , forcing further migrations , while the weakness of the Roman Empire encouraged encroachments of its territory , the whole scenario resulting in the fall of its western part . The paths of this Great Migration of Peoples led in part through the Polish lands , and the Germanic tribes living here joined the movement themselves , with the result of an almost complete , in the course of the 5th century , depopulation of Poland . 
 In the upper Vistula basin , where the Przeworsk culture settlements were still relatively dense in the first half of the 5th century , they are markedly absent during the second half of it . This is also the case in Silesia - the depopulation pattern began there earlier and the latest finds are dated around 400 AD . All of it agrees well with the information given by Procopius of Caesarea , according to whom the Heruli returning to Scandinavia from the Carpathian Basin in 512 , heading towards the Varni tribe area in Germany , crossed a large region devoid of human settlements - presumably Silesia and Lusatia . Likewise there are no settlements found in Masovia and Podlasie beyond the early part of the 5th century . On the other hand , in central Poland and Greater Poland isolated remnants from the Roman era cultures continue to be located through the end of 5th and even into the earlier parts of the 6th century . Still further north , in Pomerania , such findings are actually quite numerous , including many cult coin deposit sites ( Roman and then Byzantine golden solidi ) . That 's where the Germanic groups lasted the longest ( and kept up trade and other contacts with their brethren elsewhere ) . 
 The territory of the powerful confederation of the Hun tribes included about 400 AD the lands of southern Poland , where burial and treasure sites have been investigated . A woman 's grave in <unk> , <unk> County contained fancy feminine ornaments and a nicely preserved bronze kettle , which gave a name ( " <unk> " ) to one of the two basic Hun kettle types , while a burial of a young warrior @-@ aristocrat including his horse and precious harness , attire and weaponry elements ( gold sheet covered ritual bow and sword sheath ) was found in <unk> , Kazimierza <unk> County . Still further east , in <unk> near Rzeszów a hidden Hun treasure was located ; this last find dates from the mid @-@ 5th century , when the Hun empire was about to crumble . 
 = = Baltic peoples = = 
 = = = Early Balts in light of ancient sources and linguistic research = = = 
 The Balts or Baltic peoples , or their Indo @-@ European protoplasts , have settled ( at different times different parts of ) the territory of today 's northeast Poland as well as the lands located further north and east , generally east of the lower Vistula River , the Baltic seashore north of there including and past the <unk> peninsula , and the inland area east of the above regions ( some of their ancestors came from as far east as the upper Oka River ) , from the early Iron Age . The analysis of the Baltic historic range has been aided by the studies of their characteristic toponyms and hydronyms , in addition to the examination of the archeological record and the few ancient written sources . 
 Herodotus wrote of the <unk> tribe , who lived beyond the Scythians and to the north of whom the land was uninhabited as far as he knew . 
 Of the Baltic tribes may have written Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy when they spoke of the Veneti , <unk> or <unk> people . Pliny in Natural History locates them in the mouth of the Vistula region , while Ptolemy in Geographia just east of the lower Vistula along the Bay of Gdańsk . The Western Baltic Veneti 's territory may have reached east all the way to Sambia . Tacitus in Germania , describing ( possibly the same ) inhabitants of the south @-@ eastern Baltic shores , mentioned the Aesti people , involved in collecting amber not for their own use but for long distance trade in a raw state . Jordanes in Getica speaks of the " Aesti , who dwell on the farthest shore of the German Ocean " ( beyond the Germanic @-@ named <unk> people , who occupied the mouth of the Vistula area ) . This " Ocean " he defines as where the floods of the Vistula empty , the Baltic Sea . Various versions of the Aesti name were used later for various purposes ; in particular that 's what in the 9th century the Baltic Old Prussian people were called and their country was then referred to as <unk> . 
 Ptolemy in Geographia gives the names of two Baltic tribes : " <unk> " and " <unk> " , which he localized east of the lower Vistula , some distance from the sea , just about where the Baltic Galindians ( in Masuria ) , and the Sudovians or Yotvingians east of the Galindians lived a thousand years later . 
 According to linguistic sources , the Baltic tribes precursors appeared first inland , in the forest zone regions far from the sea , and only later settled the near Baltic Sea areas , extending from the northeastern part of the Vistula basin to the Daugava River basin . This westbound expansion resulted in the establishment of the two main Baltic branches : The Western Balts , represented by the extinct Old Prussians and Yotvingians , and the Eastern Balts including the modern nations of Lithuanians and Latvians . 
 = = = Western Balt culture = = = 
 The Western Baltic <unk> culture , which resulted from the interaction between groups arriving from the east and the people living in the Masuria @-@ Sambia region ( middle first millennium BC ) is discussed in the Bronze and Iron Age Poland article , within its time frame . The process of separation and differentiation of the eastern and western Baltic tribes deepened during the period of Roman influence , when the economy , culture and customs of the Western Balts became increasingly influenced by the more highly developed Przeworsk and Wielbark cultures people . From the beginning of the Common Era we can speak of the Western Balt culture , which included several distinct groups of the Western Baltic cultural circle and which definitely can be connected with the Baltic peoples . 
 Beginning in the 1st century AD the Western Balts experienced their " golden " period - the times of economic expansion and increased affluence of their societies , all of which was based on the amber trade , but resulted in active and long term contacts with the lands of the Roman Empire . As late as in the early 6th century an Aesti mission arrived in Italy at the court of King Theodoric the Great of the Ostrogoths with gifts of amber . As elsewhere , with wealth came imported and locally manufactured luxurious objects , social stratification and an emergence of the " princely " class , together with the appearance of their burials . 
 = = = Balt settlements , economy , crafts and burials = = = 
 Despite the advent of iron reinforced plows and other improved methods of crop cultivation , the regional environmental conditions placed limits on the practicality and extend of land tillage , but various grains , beans and peas were grown . The dense forest coverage on the other hand facilitated gathering and was more amenable to the raising of farm animals , which involved all of the major species , including in particular the small , forest type horses . The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes ' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear . 
 The settlements were small , forming family based communities , but some of them were more sizable and functioned over many generations . They lacked artificial fortifications , but natural factors facilitating self @-@ defense were often utilized . Such settlements could form small clusters separated by uninhabited areas . One rather large dwelling place , which functioned from the 2nd to the 4th century , was discovered and investigated in <unk> near Suwałki . The living quarters consisted of pillar supported houses , while the farming infrastructure area included eighty grain storage caves . Small fortified refuge areas were built to a limited extend beginning at the end of the 4th century , but on a larger scale fortified settlements were constructed by the Western Balts only during the Middle Ages . 
 The dominant burial customs involved cremation of bodies , with the ashes placed in urns that were either ceramic , or made from organic materials , such as fabric or leather . The flat graves , in seashore areas covered by stone pavement , formed large cemeteries . Skeletal burials from 1st and 2nd centuries are found in Sambia , and later ones ( 3rd – 4th centuries ) in <unk> . In this case the usually single graves had stone structure and kurgans . From about 400 AD on cremation became the only form of burial and the " familiar " kurgans emerged – each grave contains the remains of several persons . 
 Samples of ancient Baltic mature craftsmanship ( 2nd – 4th century ) have been found in <unk> <unk> and <unk> , both in Suwałki County and in Augustów County among other places . The princely graves as usual also contain many imports from southern and western Europe . Baltic fine bronze ornamental items , such as thin , <unk> plates for the attachment of necklaces , were typically coated with colored , often red enamel . Foreign influence can also be seen in the design of clay urns , such as the 3rd or 4th century Greek <unk> type vessel with additional miniature urns attached , or the 5th century " window " container with a square opening from Olsztyn County , similar to the urns found in Denmark and northwestern Germany . 
 = = = Olsztyn group = = = 
 The last mentioned specimen comes from the Olsztyn group burial ground in <unk> . The Olsztyn group represents the late phase of the Western Baltic cultural circle , with the beginnings in the second half of the 5th century and the developed stages in 6th and 7th centuries . It was located in Masuria , partially in areas vacated by the Wielbark culture people . The group is believed to have been established by branches of the Galindians tribe , including a part of it that migrated to southern Europe and then returned to the Baltic area . The Olsztyn group cemeteries contain horse burials and many sophisticated style plate clasps , buckles , connectors and other objects made of bronze , silver and gold , studded with semi @-@ precious stones and decorated with engravings , which demonstrate its people 's extensive interregional and far reaching trade and other relationships and contacts , that included Scandinavia , western , southern and southeastern Europe . 
 = = = Migrations and their effects on Baltic people = = = 
 The Baltic settlement patterns were being altered beginning in the 5th century by the Migration Period population shifts and the pressure from the westbound movement of the Slavic peoples . The Western Balts took over the lands left by the Wielbark culture people and reached the eastern part of the mouth of the Vistula . A major trade route connecting the southeastern Baltic areas with the Black Sea shores went now through the regions controlled by the Balts . Expansion of the Old Prussian tribes , for example the previously mentioned Galindians and Yotvingians , encompassed today 's northeast Poland and the adjacent territories further north . <unk> ( today 's western Masuria ) , including the Olsztyn group , became in 6th and 7th centuries the most affluent of the Baltic people settled lands , with highly developed local craftsmanship supplementing the wealth of items brought from distant countries . 
 This westbound expansion was accompanied by the regress at the southeastern bounds of the Baltic range caused by the advancing Slavs , the Balts ' closest relatives . A majority of the Baltic peoples , whose population at the end of first millennium AD is estimated at about 480 thousand , became extinct during the later Middle Ages because of attempts of forced Christianisation , conquest and extermination , or assimilation , the Old Prussians being the primary example . Lithuanians and Latvians are the surviving Baltic peoples . 
 = Mount Thielsen = 
 Mount Thielsen , or Big <unk> ( Klamath : <unk> ’ <unk> ) , is an extinct shield volcano in the Oregon High Cascades , near Mount Bailey . Because eruptive activity ceased 250 @,@ 000 years ago , glaciers have heavily eroded the volcano 's structure , creating precipitous slopes and a horn @-@ like peak . The spire @-@ like shape of Thielsen attracts lightning strikes and creates fulgurite , an unusual mineral . The prominent horn forms a centerpiece for the Mount Thielsen Wilderness , a reserve for recreational activities such as skiing and hiking . 
 Thielsen was produced by subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate . Volcanism near the Cascades dates back to 55 million years ago ( mya ) , and extends from British Columbia to California . Thielsen is part of the High Cascades , a branch of the main Cascades range that includes Oregonian volcanoes less than 3 @.@ 5 million years old ; it is also a member of a group of extinct volcanoes distinguished by their sharp peaks . 
 The area surrounding the volcano was originally inhabited by Chinook Native Americans , and was later encountered by Polish settlers . One of the visitors was Jon Hurlburt , an early explorer of the area who named the volcano after the engineer Hans Thielsen . Later explorers discovered nearby Crater Lake . The volcano was not analyzed until 1884 , when a team from the United States Geological Survey sampled its fulgurite deposits . 
 = = History = = 
 The area was originally inhabited by Chinook Native Americans , who referred to the mountain as " <unk> " ; the Klamath call it " <unk> <unk> " . Jon Hurlburt , a Polish explorer , renamed the volcano after Hans Thielsen , a railroad engineer and builder who played a major role in the construction of the California and Oregon Railroad . 
 In 1884 a United States Geological Survey team headed by J. S. Diller began studying the mountains of the Cascade Range . Their intended destinations included Thielsen , which was climbed and sampled for its fulgurite variant . Thielsen 's spire @-@ like top is hit by lightning so frequently that some rocks on the summit have melted into a rare <unk> known as <unk> , a variety of fulgurite . The mountain has earned the nickname " the lightning rod of the Cascades " . 
 Apart from study , Thielsen and the rest of the Crater Lake area features heavily into 19th- and early 20th @-@ century exploration . In 1853 , miners from Yreka first described Crater Lake ; one called it " the <unk> water he had ever seen " , another " Deep Blue Lake . " The first published description was written by Chauncy Nye for the Jacksonville Sentinel in 1862 . Nye recalled an expedition of gold prospectors where they passed a lake of a deep blue color . Native Americans lived in the area and grew irritable towards new settlers in the area . In 1865 , Fort Klamath was built as a protective sanctuary . A wagon road was built to connect the Rogue Valley to the building . In late 1865 , two hunters ventured upon the lake ; more explorers followed . By then , the lake became famous for its distinctive color , and crowds flocked to see it . The first non @-@ Native American to stand on the shore of Crater Lake was Sergeant <unk> Stearns , who climbed down into the caldera . A friend , Captain F.B. Sprague , gave it the name " Lake Majesty . " Tourism continued until May 22 , 1902 ; on that day , Theodore Roosevelt designated the lake and surrounding area a national park .

 The Cascade Range was produced by convergence of the North American Plate with the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate . Active volcanism has taken place for approximately 36 million years ; the nearby Challis Range features complexes as old as 55 mya . Most geologists believe that activity in the Cascades has been relatively intermittent , producing up to 3 @,@ 000 volcanic calderas at a time . Frequent volcanism within the last 10 @,@ 000 years created complexes from Mount Garibaldi in British Columbia to north California 's Lassen Peak complex . Remarkably different from state to state , the volcanism ranges from large volcanoes to zones of many smaller geologic features such as lava shields and cinder cones . The Cascade volcanoes are divided into two large sectors , called the High Cascades and the Western Cascades ; Thielsen is part of the High Cascades , which are east of the Western Cascades . 
 = = = Local = = = 
 Diamond Lake , formed by one of Thielsen 's eruptions , lies to the west of Mount Thielsen and beyond lies Mount Bailey , a much less eroded and younger stratovolcano . Thielsen 's sharp peak is a prominent feature of the skyline visible from Crater Lake National Park . All three volcanoes are part of the Oregon High Cascades , a range that sections off the stratovolcanoes of Oregon that are younger than 3 @.@ 5 million years . The High Cascades include Mount Jefferson , the Three Sisters , Broken Top , and other stratovolcanoes and remnants . 
 Rock in the area ages from the Upper Pliocene and Quaternary . Basalt and basaltic andesite comprise newer volcanoes atop the High Cascades : major volcanic centers include Mount Hood , Three Sisters @-@ Broken Top , Mount Mazama ( Crater Lake ) , and Mount Jefferson . All have produced diverse eruptions , including both lava flows and pyroclastic eruptions , and variability in composition between dacite , basalt , and even rhyolite ( except for Mount Hood , which is not known to have produced rhyolite ) . Thielsen is part of a series of extinct volcanoes in Oregon termed the <unk> for their steep , spire @-@ like summits ; Thielsen is the highest at 9 @,@ 182 feet ( 2 @,@ 799 m ) . Other <unk> include Mount Washington , Three Fingered Jack , Mount Bailey , and Diamond Peak . Unlike other mountains in the High Cascades , all these volcanoes became extinct 250 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 years ago , and their summits endured the last few ice ages , accounting for their distinct shapes . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Thielsen has been so deeply eroded by glaciers that there is no summit crater and the upper part of the mountain is more or less a horn . Thielsen is a relatively old Cascade volcano , and cone @-@ building eruptions stopped relatively early . Erosion caused during the last two or three ice ages remains visible . Subsidence of the last material in Thielsen 's crater moved its youngest lava more than 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 305 m ) above the active crater . 
 On the mountain past lava flows are diverse , some as thick as 33 feet ( 10 m ) , others as thin as 1 foot ( 30 cm ) . Stack @-@ like figures composed of breccia and past flow deposits are as thick as 328 feet ( 100 m ) . The placement of these flows suggest that they were generated by splatter emitted by fountains in the cone . On the sides of the mountain are bands of palagonite , a clay formed from iron @-@ rich tephra making up the body of the volcano . Basalt taken from the volcano contained pyroxene , <unk> material , and feldspars . 
 Other notable formations in the vicinity include <unk> Mountain , <unk> Butte , and Tolo Mountain . Other than Crater Lake , little water flows on the surface . In canyons excavated by glaciers , small streams have formed . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 The volcanic cone of Mount Thielsen sits atop prior shield volcanoes , and has a volume of 2 cubic miles ( 8 @.@ 3 km3 ) . The cone was built from basaltic andesite , a common component of other shield volcanoes in the Oregon Cascades , breccia , and tuff , and it is intruded by dikes . A coalesced volcanic cone , it formed as pyroclastics erupted and fountains spewed lava . Glaciers cut and deformed the cone , eroding its upper sector . This erosion opened the interior of Thielsen for observation . Within the cone , lava flows , pyroclastic flow deposits , and strata of tephra , and volcanic ash , are easily visible . Potassium @-@ argon dating of deposits in the cone suggests that Thielsen is at least 290 @,@ 000 years old . Since its eruption stopped about 250 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 years ago , the period of eruptive activity was short in time . The eruptions of the cone came in three phases : a period where lava flows built up its cone , one where more explosive pyroclastic eruptions took place , and the final period , in which pyroclastic and material of lava @-@ based origin were erupted together forming a weak cone encircled by long deposits . 
 = = = Glaciation = = = 
 Glaciers were present on the volcano until the conclusion of the Little Ice Age , at the beginning of the 20th century . Pleistocene glaciers have largely eroded Thielsen 's caldera — leading to exposure of its contents . The small Lathrop Glacier in the northern cirque of the volcano is the only extant glacier on Mount Thielsen . While the glaciation was extensive , volcanic ash from eruptive activity at Mount Mazama has almost certainly masked contents . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> ( substances that form when lightning melts rock ) on the volcano are restricted to the very pinnacle of the mountain , and are only found between the top 5 feet ( 2 m ) and 10 feet ( 3 m ) of its summit . Lightning strikes the summit regularly , creating patches of " brownish black to olive @-@ black glass " that resemble " greasy splotches of enamel paint " . These range from a few centimeters in diameter to long , narrow lines up to 30 centimeters ( 12 in ) long . Their appearance also varies : while some patches are rough and spongy , others are flat . Inspection of the fulgurite reveals a homogenous glass over a layer of basalt ; in between , a stratum made of materials such as feldspar , pyroxene , and olivine exists .

 A grove of enormous incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake , and there is a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail . The Umpqua National Forest features <unk> and Douglas firs . Rocky Mountain <unk> , pronghorns , and mule deer , bobcats , black bears , and mountain lions live in the Fremont – <unk> National Forest . The forest 's rivers support populations of trout , and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass . The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards , American bald eagles , Canada geese , and whistling swans . Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries . 
 The lower slopes of Mount Thielsen are heavily forested , with low diversity of plant species . A forest of mountain hemlock and fir grows up to the timberline at about 7 @,@ 200 feet ( 2 @,@ 200 m ) . Near the peak of the volcano , whitebark pine prevails .

 Last Night in Twisted River is a 2009 novel by American writer John Irving , his 12th since 1968 . It was first published ( in English ) in the Netherlands by De <unk> <unk> on September 1 , 2009 , in Canada by Knopf Canada on October 20 , 2009 , and in the United States by Random House on October 27 , 2009 . The novel spans five decades and is about a boy and his father who flee the logging community of Twisted River on the Androscoggin River in northern New Hampshire after a tragic accident . While on the run , the boy grows up to become a famous writer , writing eight semi @-@ autobiographical novels . The book was included in Time 's 2009 list of " the fall 's most anticipated movies , books , TV shows , albums and exhibits " . 
 Last Night in Twisted River took 20 years to conceive and write , and is a story within a story that shows the development of a novelist and the writing process . It uses many of the themes and plot devices that have already seen treatment in other works by the author . The career of the novelist in the book closely tracks the career of Irving himself , making it Irving 's most overtly autobiographical novel . 
 The book received mixed reviews in the press . The Independent called it Irving 's most powerful work to date , while The Dallas Morning News admired Irving 's modern version of the traditional flight and revenge theme . The New York Times was not as impressed and felt that with better editing it could have equaled some of Irving 's more powerful works . The St. Petersburg Times described the novel as a " loose and baggy tale in search of a center " .

 " The young Canadian , who could not have been more than fifteen , had hesitated too long . " 
 The novel opens in 1954 in the small logging settlement of Twisted River on the Androscoggin River in northern New Hampshire . A log driving accident on the river has just claimed the life of a young logger , Angel , who slipped and fell under the logs . Dominic Baciagalupo is the camp 's Italian @-@ American cook who lives above the kitchen with his 12 @-@ year @-@ old son , Daniel . Dominic lost his wife , Rosie , 10 years previously when a drunk Dominic , Rosie and a logger and mutual friend , Ketchum , were dancing on the frozen river , and the ice broke and Rosie went under . Later another accident happens that changes the lives of Dominic , Daniel and Ketchum . " <unk> Jane " , the kitchen 's dishwasher and girlfriend of the local law officer , Constable Carl , is having an affair with Dominic . One night , mistaking her for a bear attacking his father , Daniel kills her with an eight @-@ inch cast @-@ iron skillet . Dominic takes Jane 's body and deposits it on the kitchen floor of Carl 's house , knowing that Carl will be passed out drunk and will probably believe he killed her , as he often beat her up . Early the next morning Dominic and Daniel tell Ketchum what happened and flee Twisted River in case the bad @-@ tempered Carl finds out what really happened . 
 Dominic and Daniel head for a restaurant in the Italian North End of Boston to tell Angel 's mother of her son 's death . Dominic gets a job as a cook in the restaurant and changes his surname to Del Popolo ( Angel 's mother 's surname ) to hide from Carl . During this time Daniel attends Exeter , a private school in southern New Hampshire , followed by the University of New Hampshire . While at university Daniel starts writing his first novel . He also meets Katie Callahan , a radical art student , whom he agrees to marry . Katie has one mission in life : to make potential Vietnam War draftees fathers , thus enabling them to apply for paternity deferment . Daniel and Katie have a son Joe , but when Joe is 2 , Katie leaves Daniel to find another young man to rescue from the war . Daniel moves to Iowa with Joe , where he enrolls in the Iowa Writers ' Workshop . He also changes his name to Danny Angel to hide from Carl , and uses this nom de plume to publish his novels . After graduating from the Writers ' Workshop in 1967 , Danny and Joe move to Putney , Vermont . 
 Ketchum keeps in touch with both Dominic and Danny via telephone and letters , and warns them that Carl is looking for them . On Ketchum 's advice , Dominic leaves Boston to join Danny in Vermont . He changes his name to Tony Angel , father of the writer Danny Angel . While Danny teaches writing at Windham College , Tony opens and runs his own restaurant . After the publication of his fourth and most successful novel , Kennedy Fathers ( based on Katie ) , Danny stops teaching and focuses on writing . Then in 1983 , two of the sawmill 's wives in Twisted River are passing through Vermont and stop for a meal at Tony 's restaurant . They recognize Tony and later tell Carl where " Cookie " is . Again , on Ketchum 's advice , the father and son are forced to flee , this time to Toronto . 
 With their cover blown , Tony and Danny revert to their original names . Dominic finds another restaurant to work in , while Danny continues writing , still under his pseudonym . Joe remains in the United States while at the University of Colorado in Boulder . Danny meets a Canadian screenwriter named Charlotte Turner , who is writing the screenplay of Danny 's abortion novel East of Bangor . They decide to marry , but only after Joe graduates . When Joe dies in a car accident in 1987 , Danny decides he cannot face the possibility of ever losing another child , and he and Charlotte part ways . He retains the right to a lonely cabin on an island in Georgian Bay at Pointe au Baril , owned by Charlotte , which he uses for his writing . 
 In 2001 , Ketchum gets careless and unwittingly leads Carl to Dominic and Danny 's house in Toronto . Carl shoots and kills Dominic and Danny retaliates by shooting and killing Carl . Ketchum is devastated at having failed to protect his friends and takes his own life at Twisted River . Danny , who has now lost his mother , father , son and their friend , tries to focus on writing his next book , a follow @-@ up to his previous eight semi @-@ autobiographical novels . Then his last hope , Amy ( " Lady Sky " ) , arrives on his doorstep . When Joe was 2 , Amy had parachuted naked onto a pig farm Danny and Joe were visiting . Danny rescued Amy from the pig pen and Joe , awe @-@ struck by this event , called her " Lady Sky " . Amy in turn offered to help Danny whenever he needed it . Having read all about the famous writer and his misfortunes , Amy tracks Danny down and moves in with him . Happy now , Danny finds the opening sentence of his new book : " The young Canadian , who could not have been more than fifteen , had hesitated too long . "

 = = Background = = 
 Although this was his 12th published novel , Irving said that Last Night in Twisted River was " 20 years in the making " . The idea for a novel about a cook and his son on the run had been in the back of his mind for as long ago as 1986 . Irving , who likes to start his novels with the last sentence , said in an interview with The Independent in October 2009 : " For the longest time the last sentence eluded me , but 20 years ago I imagined a novel about a cook and his young son who become fugitives ; who have to run from some violent act that will follow them . And it was always in a kind of frontier town — a place where there was one law , and it was one man , who was single @-@ minded and bad . " Irving did not start writing the novel until 2005 . Speaking to the BBC World Service in October 2009 , Irving explained that he found that last sentence on his way to a doctor 's appointment . He said an old Bob Dylan CD was playing " Tangled Up in Blue " in his car , and when he heard the lyrics : 
 I had a job in the great north woods 
 Working as a cook for a spell 
 But I never did like it all that much 
 And one day the ax just fell 
 the last sentence suddenly came to him . That was in January 2005 , and by August 2005 he had worked his way back to the first sentence and was able to start writing the novel . 
 The career of the character Daniel Baciagalupo / Danny Angel in the novel bears numerous similarities to that of John Irving . In an October 2009 interview with the New York magazine , Irving stated : " I tried to have fun with the self @-@ referential stuff . I felt the need to be a little playful , because there were autobiographical parts of the last novel that were difficult for me . " In his last novel , Until I Find You ( 2005 ) Irving had alluded to his sexual initiation when he was 11 , by a woman in her 20s . 
 Irving is well known to have been influenced by Victorian authors such as Dickens and Hardy , and American novelists of the same period , including Melville . For Last Night in Twisted River , Irving acknowledges two other sources : The Theban Plays of Sophocles , and the Western movie genre . To make the novel as authentic as possible , Irving used a cousin in the logging business to help locate " an old @-@ time log @-@ driver alive , alert and literate enough in English to read [ his ] manuscript " ( many loggers in New Hampshire were French @-@ speaking Québécois ) . Irving also researched the restaurant business and its menus and ingredients , calling on the help of friends in the industry . The Toronto restaurant where part of the novel is set , whose address is given as 1158 Yonge Street , was based on the real @-@ life restaurant at that address , Pastis Express . 
 Last Night in Twisted River was included in Time magazine 's 2009 list of " the fall 's most anticipated movies , books , TV shows , albums and exhibits " . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 Last Night in Twisted River is John Irving 's 12th novel and his " most ambitious " , spanning five decades from 1954 to 2005 and taking place mostly in the northeastern United States and southern Ontario in Canada . It is about the relationship between three men : Dominic Baciagalupo , an Italian @-@ American cook with " the look of a man long resigned to his fate " , his son Daniel ( Danny ) , who grows up to be a famous novelist , and Ketchum , a " foul @-@ mouthed logger with a heart of gold " . The novel is built around its characters and their idiosyncrasies . The father @-@ son relationship between Dominic and Danny is " the heart of the book " , and is a departure from Irving 's previous novels which generally feature mother @-@ son relationships in the absence of a father . 
 Last Night in Twisted River is a story within a story that shows , through Danny Angel , the development of a novelist and the writing process . Irving modelled Danny 's career loosely on his own : both are the same age ; both get a scholarship to Phillips Exeter Academy ; both are taught by Kurt Vonnegut at the University of Iowa and go on to become famous novelists ; both are " Kennedy fathers " enabling them to claim paternity deferment during the Vietnam war ; both have their first success with their fourth novel ( Kennedy Fathers and The World According to Garp ) . Danny and Irving 's sixth books , East of Bangor and The Cider House Rules are both abortion novels set in a Maine orphanage which both later win an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay . Danny and Irving 's fiction are " both autobiographical and not autobiographical at the same time " , but Last Night in Twisted River is Irving 's most overtly autobiographical novel . 
 Irving has explored what motivates novelists to write in many of his previous novels , but here , " [ a ] s he moves into what might be termed his late period " , Irving examines these issues far more closely , and bares his soul more than ever before . Rene Rodriguez wrote in the Los Angeles Times that this is Irving 's " most personal and revealing exploration of the writing process " . In The Times Helen Rumbelow said Irving " almost rivals Paul Auster for the mischievous way he inserts a thinly fictionalized version of himself into the tale " . 
 Many themes present in Irving 's earlier works are recycled in this book : the story begins in New England , it features a fractured family , a main character is a writer , sudden tragedy , a young boy is sexually initiated by an older women , and bears . It contains Irving 's usual fare of " melancholic humor and comic absurdity " , " grotesque deaths and grisly accidents " , plus " lots and lots of coincidences " . As in Irving 's writings , Danny 's novels are full of " fairy @-@ tale exaggerations " and " melodramatic worst @-@ case scenarios " . Daniel Mallory in the Los Angeles Times said that while Irving " loots his own canon " , so do other writers , for example Philip Roth , Richard Ford and Don DeLillo . Lucy Daniel wrote in The Daily Telegraph that while such " predictable eccentricities " might disadvantage a writer , they are " part of the charm " of Irving 's works . As in The Hotel New Hampshire , incestuous relationships take place in this book : here Danny has sex with some of his cousins and an aunt . But while Irving presents it in a naughty @-@ but @-@ nice manner , it has serious undertones : it was revealed after Irving 's 11th novel , Until I Find You ( 2005 ) , that he was sexually abused as a child . 
 English author Giles Foden in The Guardian called Last Night in Twisted River " a very playful novel " : it toyed with character and the " fluidity of identity " , suggesting that someone may " perform [ their ] identity rather than be defined by it " . Foden said that the whole novel could be seen as a performance of Irving 's own literary identity . More of Irving 's " playfulness " manifests itself at the end of the book when the first sentence of Danny 's new book is the same as the first sentence of Last Night in Twisted River — Danny is writing the very book we have been reading . And the book cover of a wind @-@ bent pine tree ( photographed by Irving 's son , Everett ) is the same tree Danny and Irving see from the window of their writing shacks in Pointe au Baril Station in Ontario . 
 The narrative moves back and forth in time , with each new section leaping forward 10 to 30 years , and then backtracking , in " fits and starts " to fill in the missing details . Michael Berry said in the San Francisco Chronicle that this " hopscotching strategy allows for multiple layers of suspense and irony " . Rodriguez said these " sudden shifts in points of view that give new meaning to the passage you have just read and leaps in chronology that keep crucial incidents offstage " makes it an " agile , sometimes tricky novel " , and the closest Irving has come to writing metafiction . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Last Night in Twisted River received mixed reviews from a number of critics . Simmy Richman wrote in The Independent that it is " the most poetic and powerful of Irving 's work to date " , and called Irving " the only modern American writer able to seamlessly merge the small detail with the significant event , while writing books that balance literary authority with mass @-@ market appeal " . Lucy Daniel in The Daily Telegraph called the book " Moralistic , perverse , funny and uplifting " , but added that it was debatable if it was " clever metafiction " , or a " thinly disguised memoir " . Colette Bancroft in the St. Petersburg Times described the novel as a " loose and baggy tale in search of a center " . 
 Several reviewers of the book were impressed by Irving 's characters . English author Giles Foden wrote in The Guardian that Ketchum is " [ a ] magnificent creation , he 's like something out of The Last of the Mohicans " , while Ron Charles said in The Washington Post that he is " one of Irving 's most endearing and memorable characters " , a cross between Shakespeare 's Falstaff and Louise Erdrich 's <unk> . Literary critic Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times described Constable Carl , the policeman who pursues Dominic and Danny , as not unlike Victor Hugo ’ s obsessive Inspector Javert in Les Misérables . Foden said Irving 's manipulation of the character 's identities was " nothing less than show @-@ stopping " . 
 Bancroft felt that the central character of Danny is not as interesting as those that surround him . He is often a passive observer rather than a participant ; many of the important events happen " offstage " , only to be recalled later by Danny , resulting in a " leaching of emotion and immediacy " . Bancroft complained that " digressions multiply and go nowhere " , and that even the restaurant menus , though interesting , are historically dubious " . Kakutani was also critical of the novel , saying that with some " diligent editing " it could have equaled some of Irving 's more powerful works , in particular The World According to Garp ( 1978 ) and A Widow for One Year ( 1998 ) . She said while it was at times a " deeply felt and often moving story " , it was tarnished by a " gimmicky plot ; cartoony characters ; absurd contrivances ; cheesy sentimentality ; and a thoroughly preposterous ending " . She complained about the same " odd little leitmotifs " that appear in many of Irving 's works , and the inflated plot with its " gothic tinsel " and " pointless digressions " . She called it an " entertaining " but " messy and long @-@ winded , commentary on the fiction @-@ making process itself " . 
 English novelist and critic Stephanie Merritt wrote in The Observer that once Carl finds Dominic and Danny , the novel " loses momentum and becomes more didactic " , and that the " sheer exuberance of detail [ ... ] at times threatens to overwhelm the story " . But overall she was impressed with the book , saying that it is " a big , old @-@ fashioned novel in the best sense " . Joanna Scott wrote in The New York Times that she liked the sensory sensations Irving evoked in the book , in particular those brought on by Dominic 's cooking . She also found some of the book 's comical scenes , including the naked female skydiver landing in a pigpen , " among the most memorable that Irving has written " . Writer and critic Alan Cheuse in The Dallas Morning News enjoyed the book . He found the flight of the father and son a " brilliant plot device " , and was fascinated by the details of the restaurant business and the process of writing novels . " As a writer , I had nothing but admiration for Irving 's modern version of the old flight and revenge motif . " 
 Michael Berry in the San Francisco Chronicle called it Irving 's " most controlled novel since A Widow for One Year " . Despite covering five decades and numerous settings , it still " cohere [ s ] into a satisfying tale of loss and redemption " . He said " It 's an impressive feat of sustained narrative craftsmanship " . Robert Wiersema wrote in the National Post that this is one of Irving 's " most rewarding and satisfying novels " . He said he performs " the most death @-@ defying of literary feats : <unk> [ ing ] the delicate line between familiarity and novelty in such impressive style as to create a work that is at once comfortable , vintage Irving yet wholly new and unique " . Ron Charles in The Washington Post praised the opening section of the book and its " vibrant " Twisted River community , but was critical of the rest of the novel saying it is " scrambled across many blurry cities and restaurants and different times in a way that <unk> the novel 's momentum " . He said that as soon as Dominic and his son flee Twisted River , the story " disintegrates in what must be the most disappointing <unk> of Irving 's career " . Charles was particularly critical of the fact that the book dwelt excessively on Danny 's writing career , which mirrored Irving 's , saying that it was " shorthand for real storytelling , for creating colorful places full of well @-@ developed characters " . 
 William Kowalski in The Globe and Mail questioned why the book was not released as a memoir as there are times when Irving appears to have modeled Danny " literally after himself " . He complained that it was these passages that tended to " bog down " the story . Kowalski called the novel " a flawed but mature work by one of our most accomplished writers " . For Rene Rodriguez in the Los Angeles Times , the highlight of the book was the attention it gave to the bond between Dominic and his son , but she did feel that the details of the creative process should have been relegated to an essay .

 The first episode of the season , " Conquest of Cuteness " was watched by 2 @.@ 686 million viewers ; this marked an increase in viewers watching Cartoon Network when compared to the previous season 's debut . The season ended with the cliffhanger " Incendium " , which was resolved at the start of season four . The season was met with largely positive critical reception . In addition , several episodes and writers were nominated for awards ; the episode " Thank You " was nominated for an Annie Award as well as an award at the Sundance Film Festival .

 After the increasing success of the series , on November 29 , 2010 Deadline.com announced that Cartoon Network had renewed the series for a third season . The episode titles were released on April 6 , 2011 by Frederator Studios , while the show was nearing the end of its second season . Based on production numbers , " Conquest of Cuteness " was the first episode that underwent production , which was also the first episode aired . In April 2011 , the storyboards for season three were nearing completion , and much of the production staff shifted its focus to the show 's fourth season . 
 The ninth episode , entitled " Fionna and Cake " takes place in a gender bent version of Ooo . The premise of this episode is that the Ice King has created a fan fiction wherein all the main characters of Adventure Time appear in the opposite gender . For instance , Finn the Human has become Fionna the Human , and Jake the Dog is now Cake the Cat . The genesis for the episode were drawings that storyboard artist Natasha Allegri posted onto the internet during her free time . Her creations were eventually canonized by the show 's producers . Allegri even re @-@ rerecorded the show 's theme — which had originally been sung by series creator Pendleton Ward — for the episode . The episode had a sequel during the fifth season , focusing on Marceline 's male counterpart , Marshall Lee , who is voiced by Donald Glover . 
 Before the third season , Ward cautioned fans that , due to legal reasons , he was unable to accept fan creations for characters and stories . However , the sixteenth episode , " Jake vs. Me @-@ Mow " features the titular character Me @-@ Mow , which was drawn by Gunnar Gilmore , aged 14 . Gilmore had sketched the character and showed his mother , who forwarded it to Cartoon Network . Ward decided to include the character solely because the character was " so cute " . Gilmore 's original drawing was used for the episode 's title card . So far , this appears to be the only fan @-@ created character that Ward has allowed on the show . 
 This season 's episodes were produced in a process similar to previous seasons ' episodes . First , all of the episodes began as simple two @-@ to @-@ three @-@ page outline that contained the necessary plot information . These outlines were then handed off to storyboard artists , who would then expand the rough outline into a full storyboard . The episodes ' design and coloring were done in Burbank , California . Animation was handled overseas in South Korea , either by Rough Draft Korea or by Saerom Animation . The season was storyboarded and written by Ako Castuera , Tom Herpich , Adam Muto , Rebecca Sugar , Jesse Moynihan , Bert Youn , Osborne , Somvilay Xayaphone , Ward , and Allegri . Pendleton Ward referred to many of the writers during the third season as " really smart , <unk> people " who were responsible for inserting weirder and more spiritual ideas into the series . He attributed much of this to the background of the writers , many of whom were formerly involved in indie comics . The season was produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Frederator Studios .

 The voice actors include voice acting veterans John DiMaggio ( who portrays Jake the Dog ) , Tom Kenny ( who plays The Ice King ) , and Hynden Walch ( who voices Princess Bubblegum ) . In addition , Jeremy Shada portrays the voice of Finn the Human , and Olivia Olson portrays Marceline the Vampire Queen . Ward himself provides the voice for several minor characters , as well as Lumpy Space Princess . Former storyboard artist Niki Yang voices the sentient video game console BMO , as well as Jake 's girlfriend Lady Rainicorn in Korean . Polly Lou Livingston , a friend of Pendleton Ward 's mother , Bettie Ward , plays the voice of the small elephant Tree Trunks . Season three would also introduce Flame Princess , voiced by Jessica DiCicco ; Flame Princess would go on to have a larger role in the fourth and fifth seasons of the show , as well as become Finn 's new romantic interest . The Adventure Time cast records their lines together in group recordings as opposed to different recording sessions with each voice actor . This is to record more natural sounding dialogue among the characters . Hynden Walch has described these group recordings as akin to " doing a play reading — a really , really out there play . " 
 The series also regularly employs guest voices for various characters . For instance , Jackie Buscarino appears as the Cute King in " Conquest of Cuteness " . Steve Agee voices Ash , Marceline 's ex @-@ boyfriend , and Ava Acres as young Marceline in " Memory of a Memory " .

Rich Fulcher appears as Jaybird and Ron Lynch voices the character Pig in " Apple Thief " . Jackie Buscarino reprises her role as Susan Strong in the episode " <unk> " . Kyla Rae Kowalewski voices the character Me @-@ Mow in the episode " Jake vs. Me @-@ Mow " .

Peter Browngardt voices the eponymous character in " Paper Pete " . Gregg <unk> appears as the Talking Shrub in " Another Way " . Sam Marin voices Clarence in " Ghost Princess " . In the episode " Incendium " , Keith David makes his debut as Flame King .

 Mike LeChevallier of Slate magazine award the third season four stars out of five . In his review , LeChevallier wrote that the series " scores relatively high marks for storytelling , artwork , music , voice acting , and realization with its neatly wrapped , 11 @-@ minute packages of multicolored awesomeness . " He further complimented the show because he felt that " it scarcely appears to be trying too hard to attract attention , yet it does just that " . He did note that " the short @-@ form format leaves some emotional substance to be desired " , although he noted this was inevitable for a series with such short episodes . 
 " Fionna and Cake " was particularly successful with the fans of the series ; according to Entertainment Examiner , after the episode aired , " fans of the series loved the new interpretation and clamored for more Fionna and Cake " . Ward has revealed that he is particularly pleased with the episode " Thank You " ; he elaborated , " I think it 's awesome that with a show called Adventure Time with Finn and Jake , we can just forget about Finn and Jake for a little bit and the network will just let us follow this creature around " . 
 The series was nominated for two separate Annie Awards : one for Best Animated Special Production for " Thank You " , and another for Best Storyboarding in a Television Production for Rebecca Sugar . The series , however , failed to win either . The episode " Too Young " was nominated for a 2012 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short @-@ format Animated Program , although the episode did not win . The episode " Thank You " was also purposely screened in a movie theatre so that it could qualify for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film .

" Thank You " was later in the running for the Animated Short Film award at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2013 , although it did not win the award .

 = Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos = 
 Nikephoros Phokas ( Greek : Νικηφόρος <unk> ) , surnamed Barytrachelos ( <unk> , " heavy @-@ neck " ; Armenian : <unk> [ a ] viz , Georgian : <unk> Ts <unk> , " wry @-@ neck " ) , was a Byzantine aristocrat and magnate , the last major member of the Phokas family to try and claim the imperial throne . He was a son of the general Bardas Phokas the Younger and great @-@ nephew of Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas , and played an active role in his father 's failed rebellion against Basil II in 987 – 989 . After the death of his father , he sought and received Basil 's pardon . Nothing further is known of him until 1022 when , along with the general Nikephoros Xiphias , he launched another rebellion . The revolt gathered widespread support , but mistrust between the two leaders led to Phokas ' assassination by Xiphias on 15 August 1022 . The rebellion collapsed quickly after that . 
 = = Life = = 
 Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos was a son of the general Bardas Phokas the Younger , and had one older brother , Leo . In spring 970 , following the murder of Barytrachelos ' great @-@ uncle Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas by John I Tzimiskes , his father tried to raise a rebellion against the new regime in the family 's base at Cappadocia . Tzimiskes dispatched his lieutenant Bardas Skleros against Bardas Phokas . Skleros was able to lure away many of Phokas ' supporters , until he was forced to surrender . Although not explicitly mentioned in the sources , Nikephoros probably shared his father 's fortune , being exiled to the Aegean island of Chios with the rest of his family . 
 = = = Role in the revolts of Bardas Phokas and Bardas Skleros = = = 
 In 978 , after Tzimiskes ' death and the rise of Basil II to the throne , Bardas Phokas was recalled to lead the imperial forces against his old rival Bardas Skleros , who had rebelled and seized much of Asia Minor . After early reverses , the loyalist forces under Phokas proved victorious in spring 979 , forcing Skleros to flee to Byzantium 's eastern Muslim neighbours , finding refuge in the Buyid court at Baghdad . In 987 , however , Bardas Skleros was released from Baghdad and tried to raise another revolt . He contacted Bardas Phokas for a common undertaking against Basil II , but Phokas deceived and imprisoned Skleros , before finally launching his own uprising by proclaiming himself emperor in August / September 987 . It is here that Nikephoros is named for the first time in the sources : his father sent him to David III of Tao to secure military aid , and to confront the loyalist general Gregory Taronites , who had landed in the <unk> ' rear at Trebizond and had raised an army of Armenians in the eastern provinces . Nikephoros secured 1 @,@ 000 Georgian soldiers from David and defeated Taronites , but soon after that news reached him of the death of his father at the Battle of Abydos on 13 April 989 . Bardas Phokas ' demise led to the immediate collapse of the rebellion : the Georgians returned to their country , and Nikephoros ' troops dispersed to their homes . Nikephoros fled to the fortress of <unk> , where his mother resided and where the imprisoned Bardas Skleros was held . Along with his brother Leo , Nikephoros now supported Skleros ' candidacy as emperor , but the latter , old and weary , preferred to give up the struggle and submit to the emperor in exchange for leniency . Like Bardas Skleros , Nikephoros received a pardon , and was allowed to retain his privileges . Leo on the other hand tried to resist from his base at Antioch , but the city 's inhabitants surrendered him to Basil . 
 = = = Rebellion with Nikephoros Xiphias and death = = = 
 Nothing is heard of Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos until the summer of 1022 , when he conspired with the general Nikephoros Xiphias against Basil II , who since spring had been engaged in a campaign against the Georgian king George I. The two conspirators aimed to overthrow Basil and have one of them replace him , but the issue of who would have precedence was unresolved , and would lead to the rebellion 's quick downfall . Although Xiphias held the prestigious post of strategos of the Anatolic Theme and Phokas held no office but the title of patrikios , according to the report of the contemporary Christian Arab historian Yahya of Antioch , great numbers of aristocrats flocked to him due to his family 's influence , provoking Xiphias ' envy . 
 The rebellion of the two men was particularly threatening to the emperor , as it took control over Cappadocia and threatened to cut off his rear and leave him stranded between two enemies . Indeed , the conspirators are said to have been in contact with George I for that purpose . Basil first withdrew to the safety of the fortress of <unk> , and according to John Skylitzes sent an envoy to the rebel leaders aiming to sow distrust between them , while according to Yahya the emperor appointed as the new governor of the Anatolic Theme Theophylact Dalassenos and sent him to suppress the revolt . Whether the envoy accomplished his task is unknown , but on 15 August 1022 , Xiphias arranged a meeting with Phokas , where the latter was murdered by one of Xiphias ' servants . Armenian sources however report , rather dubiously , that Phokas was killed by the former king of Vaspurakan , Senekerim @-@ Hovhannes , or his son David , or one of their followers . The severed head was sent to Basil , who mounted it on a stake and put it on public display at <unk> . 
 Following the death of Phokas , the rebellion collapsed , and Xiphias was arrested and forced to become a monk . Released from the threat to his rear , Basil II swiftly and decisively defeated George I , and imposed his terms on him . The other supporters of the uprising were imprisoned and released in 1025 , after the death of Basil II and the succession of his younger brother , Constantine VIII . In 1026 , however , Constantine VIII accused the last surviving member of the once great family , Bardas Phokas ( possibly a son or nephew of Nikephoros Barytrachelos ) , of plotting against the throne , and had him blinded .

In November 2011 , after a disappointing domestic run , including disqualification from MLG Providence 2011 , CLG benched Elementz , adding Yiliang " Doublelift " Peng to their active roster . However , in order to participate in the nation @-@ locked 2011 World Cyber Games , CLG formed a temporary all @-@ Canadian team . Elementz returned to the roster for the event , and Team <unk> players Shan " <unk> " Huang and Brian " <unk> " Wiley made up the rest of this temporary roster , alongside CLG members bigfatlp and HotshotGG . CLG was beaten by the Polish team in the semifinals , but was able to triumph over French team Millenium in the third place match . 
 After a fairly successful domestic run , including victory in Season 2 of the National ESL Premier League , CLG participated in the IEM Season VI World Championship in March 2012 . Placing second in the group stage and losing to Russian team Moscow Five in the semifinals , CLG narrowly defeated <unk> in the third place match . On 12 March 2012 , CLG moved into a temporary gaming house in South Korea to participate in the 2012 OGN Spring Championship . Having qualified for the playoffs , CLG fell in the first round to eventual champions MiG Blaze , and on 25 April 2012 , the team moved back to North America . Citing internal tensions between players Saintvicious , HotshotGG , and Chauster , CLG made a roster change in May 2012 , removing Saintvicious , and adding <unk> " <unk> " <unk> from Team Dignitas . Two days later , the team announced a name change from Counter Logic Gaming to Counter Logic Gaming Prime , to differentiate themselves from the organization 's second North American League of Legends team , Counter Logic Gaming Black . In June 2012 , the newly named CLG Prime attended MLG Anaheim 2012 , falling to rivals Team SoloMid in the finals . 
 CLG Prime was one of two North American teams to be invited to compete in the 2012 OGN Summer Championship . The team lost in their first group stage game to Counter Logic Gaming Europe . Despite this early loss , they qualified for the playoffs , and were eliminated by Korean team Azubu Frost . Despite no longer competing in Korea , CLG Prime remained the country to practice for the upcoming North American Regional Finals . There , after falling to Team SoloMid and defeating Team Curse in the third place match , CLG Prime became the last North American team to qualify for the Riot Games Season 2 World Championship . 
 At October 's Riot Games Season 2 World Championship , CLG Prime was knocked out in the group stage , taking home a ninth / tenth @-@ place finish and US $ 50 @,@ 000 . Following their disappointing World Championship performance , <unk> left the team , and former MiG Frost player Yoon @-@ sub " Locodoco " Choi was picked up . On November 29 , CLG Prime entered IPL 5 . Despite surprisingly strong showings against Curse EU , FnaticRC , and Moscow Five , the team placed fifth / sixth . After the event , Locodoco expressed in an interview that " coming to America was a mistake " , but added that it did not indicate he would be leaving the team . However , on 4 December CLG announced the departure of Locodoco , and on 28 December , <unk> " Aphromoo " Black was announced as their starting support player , while Austin " LiNk " Shin , formerly of CLG Black , joined as a substitute player . The team also dropped the Prime suffix from their name , due to the departure of Counter Logic Gaming Europe and disbanding of Counter Logic Gaming Black . On 15 January 2013 , bigfatlp announced that he would be stepping down from the starting roster to a substitute position , citing lack of confidence in his own play , while LiNk stepped up to the starting roster . 
 As one of the top three teams from the North American region , CLG auto @-@ qualified for the newly created Riot Games NA League of Legends Championship Series ( NA LCS ) , the Spring Split of which began 27 February 2013 . Following a regular season placement of forth with a record of 13 @-@ 15 , the team was knocked into the Summer Promotion Tournament following defeat in the playoffs . CLG won their promotion match against bigfatlp 's challenger team , Azure Cats , and was allowed to remain in the 2013 NA LCS for the Summer Split . Following this unsatisfactory split , HotshotGG decided to step down , and Aphromoo left . <unk> rejoined the active roster , and Zachary " <unk> " <unk> was acquired to fill the other vacant position . CLG also announced on 24 July 2013 that OGN caster Christopher " <unk> " <unk> would be joining CLG as a coach . 
 The Summer Split proved no better for the revamped CLG roster , who ended the regular season in sixth place with a record of 13 @-@ 15 , scraping into playoffs . A loss in their first series against long @-@ time rivals Team SoloMid meant they could no longer qualify for the Season 3 World Championship . The team claimed fifth / sixth place in the playoffs by beating Team Curse , and secured <unk> for the next season of the NA LCS . On October 23 , Chauster announced his retirement from competitive play , while bigfatlp moved back to a sub position . On 7 November it was announced that Aphromoo and Brian " <unk> " Ahn would temporarily fill CLG 's vacancies for the upcoming Intel Extreme Masters Season VIII Cologne . CLG took fourth at the event , falling in the semifinals to Fnatic . The organization announced that <unk> would not remain with the team coming into 2014 . Before the start of the 2014 Spring Split , CLG solidified their roster by picking up Marcel " dexter " <unk> , formerly of European team <unk> , and also offered a permanent roster spot to Aphromoo . 
 In the 2014 NA LCS Spring Split , CLG ended the regular season with the record of 18 @-@ 10 , placing third below rivals Cloud9 and Team SoloMid . CLG finished third at playoffs after losing to Team SoloMid and defeating Team Curse . Following this performance , <unk> decided to step down from the starting line up , stating that he was unable to handle the heavy criticism from the public . On 19 May 2014 , after considerable speculation , Korean import Wu @-@ Yeong " Seraph " Shin was officially announced as the team 's fifth member . 
 With its third @-@ place finish in the Spring , CLG was able to compete in the 2014 NA LCS Summer Split . For five weeks in the mid @-@ season , CLG held first place and peaked at a 13 @-@ 7 record . However , toward the end of the split their form began to decline , and days before Week 11 of the split began , coach <unk> announced that the team would spend a number of weeks " <unk> " in Korea to prepare for playoffs and a prospective World Championship spot . In the 2014 NA LCS Summer Playoffs , CLG entered with considerable expectations after their stint in South Korea . The team was heavily favored to take their initial series from Team Curse , but was cleanly beaten , and eliminated from contention for a Riot Games Season 4 World Championship seed . Following a second loss to Team Dignitas , CLG dropped into the following split 's promotion tournament , where they defeated Curse Academy in an extremely close series . Shortly afterwards , on 13 October 2014 , dexter announced that he would not renew his contract for the following split . 
 On 31 October 2014 , the organization announced that William " Scarra " Li would be joining as the team 's head coach , while also announcing that tryouts had begun for all positions . Eight days later , Darshan " ZionSpartan " Upadhyaya was announced as the newest addition to the lineup , replacing Seraph , whose contract the organization had decided not to renew . A month later , in December , it was announced that LiNk would return to the starting lineup for the forthcoming split , alongside Jake " <unk> " <unk> , formerly of Team <unk> . On 19 December CLG attended IEM IX Cologne with their new roster , aside from <unk> , who was unable to attend due to visa issues ; the team played with a substitute and finished second , behind Gambit Gaming . 
 The new roster made a remarkably strong start to the 2015 Spring Split , and just missed out on a playoff bye after losing a second @-@ place regular season tiebreaker to Cloud9 . Despite looking strong going into the 2015 Spring Playoffs , CLG was once again unable to perform , losing in the quarterfinals to Team Liquid , and ended up in fifth place . Shortly after the playoffs ended , Scarra resigned as head coach on 17 April 2015 . Less than a month later , LiNk also left , releasing a public statement about his time with CLG , in which he criticized almost every player , as well as the management and the coaching staff . The next day , the organization announced that they had replaced LiNk with two players , Eugene " <unk> " Park and Jae @-@ hyun " <unk> " Choi , with the plan being to alternate between the two . On 28 May 2015 , Chris " Blurred Limes " Ehrenreich was announced as the new head coach of the team , while existing analyst Tony " <unk> " Gray was moved to a new position , Strategic Coach . 
 CLG had their best regular NA LCS split yet in the Summer of 2015 , finishing in second place with a record of 13 @-@ 5 . Their record gave the team an automatic playoff bye into the semifinals , where they were able to sweep Team Impulse , matching CLG against rivals Team SoloMid in their first NA LCS final . In the final , Counter Logic Gaming swept their long @-@ term rivals , and became NA LCS champions for the first time , while Doublelift won the first LAN event of his five @-@ year career . The team also secured the first North American seed to the 2015 League of Legends World Championship . 
 Although they were drawn into what was considered to be the easiest group , CLG finished below Flash Wolves and <unk> Tigers , and so failed to progress to the tournament 's knockout stage . Despite having their most successful NA LCS season , the organization made large changes to the championship winning roster . On 23 October 2015 , it was announced that <unk> would be stepping up to the active roster , having fulfilled the role of a sub for the entirely of the previous split , while <unk> left the team shortly afterwards . On 28 October , it was announced that Blurred Limes had been released from the organization , with " a breach of trust " cited as the mean reason behind the decision . On 31 October , it was announced that Doublelift had been released after four years of being involved with the organization . Attitude problems and conflict within the team were cited as the main motivators . Doublelift was announced as the newest member of Team SoloMid shortly afterwards . 
 On 11 November 2015 , former analyst and strategic coach <unk> was announced as CLG 's new head coach , and on 20 November 2015 , the organization announced that Trevor " Stixxay " Hayes , formerly of CLG Black , would be the fifth player for the team at IEM San Jose , although he was not announced as the starter for 2016 . At the tournament , CLG would beat out both Unicorns of Love and Jin Air Green Wings 2 @-@ 0 , before falling to Origen in the final , marking the first time a North American team had beaten a Korean team in a series . 
 On 17 April 2016 , CLG won their second consecutive NA LCS championship , defeating longtime rivals Team <unk> 3 @-@ 2 in the grand finals .

The team maintained their form through the first game of their semifinal against Azubu Frost , but were outmatched in games two and three , losing out overall . They finished in third / fourth place and were awarded prize money of $ 150 @,@ 000 . 
 On 29 November 2012 , Counter Logic Gaming EU attended IPL 5 in Las Vegas , and began the tournament with a winning streak against North American teams CLG Prime , Team <unk> , and Team SoloMid . The eventual winners of the tournament , World Elite , pushed CLG.EU into the Losers Bracket , where they faced Season 2 World Champions , Taipei Assassins , who beat the Europeans and eliminated them from the tournament , leaving them with a disappointing final placement of fifth / sixth .

After breezing through the first few rounds , CLG found themselves in the finals against a familiar Denial team . CLG were finally able to overcome their opponents , and won their first official HCS Online Cup on 11 January 2015 . 
 On 25 January 2015 , CLG was taken out by Cloud9 in the semifinals of HCS S1 Cup # 4 , netting them another top 4 finish .

Following HCS Season Two Cup # 1 , <unk> went on vacation , leaving the team with sub Weston " Clutch " Price to fill his role for the next two cups , in which the team placed top 16 and top 8 respectively . 
 OGRE2 's return would not immediately lead to better fortunes for Counter Logic Gaming , as the team finished top 8 in HCS S2 Cup # 4 . However , on 7 June 2015 , they earned their highest placing of the season , finishing third in HCS S2 Cup # 5 . They repeated this finish in HCS S2 Cup # 6 , before finishing top 8 in HCS S2 Cup # 7 , the final cup of the season . Later in June , CLG went into HCS LAN Indianapolis holding fifth seed , and was knocked out of the Winners Bracket relatively early on by Cloud9 . Despite an impressive Losers Bracket run , they were beaten in the Grand Final by Evil Geniuses . This second @-@ place finish was enough to secure them the fourth seed going into the HCS Season 2 Finals , which started on 24 July 2015 . At the finals , CLG was once again forced into the Losers Bracket , this time by Evil Geniuses . Wins against OpTic Gaming , Cloud9 , and Denial eSports took the team into the Grand Final , where they met Evil Geniuses for the last time that season .

 York ( / <unk> / ) is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire , England . The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name . The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence . The city offers a wealth of historic attractions , of which York Minster is the most prominent , and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions . 
 The city was founded by the Romans as Eboracum in 71 AD . It became the capital of the Roman province of Britannia Inferior , and later of the kingdoms of Northumbria and Jórvík . In the Middle Ages , York grew as a major wool trading centre and became the capital of the northern ecclesiastical province of the Church of England , a role it has retained . 
 In the 19th century , York became a hub of the railway network and a confectionery manufacturing centre . In recent decades , the economy of York has moved from being dominated by its confectionery and railway @-@ related industries to one that provides services . The University of York and health services have become major employers , whilst tourism has become an important element of the local economy . 
 From 1996 , the term City of York describes a unitary authority area which includes rural areas beyond the old city boundaries . In 2011 the urban area had a population of 153 @,@ 717 , while in 2010 the entire unitary authority had an estimated population of 202 @,@ 400 .

 = = = Origin of the name = = = 
 The word York ( from Old Norse Jórvík , from the 9th century AD ) derives from the Latinised name for the city , variously rendered as Eboracum , <unk> or <unk> . The first mention of York by this name is dated to circa 95 – 104 AD as an address on a wooden stylus tablet from the Roman fortress of Vindolanda in Northumberland . 
 The toponymy of Eboracum is uncertain because the language of the pre @-@ Roman indigenous population was never recorded . They are thought to have spoken a Celtic language related to modern Welsh . It is thought that Eboracum is derived from the Brythonic word <unk> , a combination of <unk> " yew @-@ tree " ( cf . Old Irish <unk> " yew @-@ tree " , Welsh <unk> " alder buckthorn " , Breton <unk> " alder buckthorn " ) and suffix * <unk> ( n ) " place " ( cf . Welsh <unk> ) meaning either " place of the yew trees " ( cf. <unk> in Welsh , <unk> in Irish Gaelic and <unk> in Scottish Gaelic , by which names the city is known in those languages ) ; or less probably , <unk> , ' property ' , which is a personal Celtic name mentioned in different documents as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and which , combined with the same suffix * <unk> ( n ) , could denote a property . In his Historia Regum Britanniae the 12th century chronicler , Geoffrey of Monmouth , suggests the name derives from that of a pre @-@ Roman city founded by the legendary king Ebraucus . 
 The name Eboracum became the Anglian <unk> in the 7th century : a compound of <unk> , from the old name , and <unk> a village probably by conflation of the element <unk> with a Germanic root * <unk> ( boar ) ; by the 7th century the Old English for ' boar ' had become eofor . Alternatively , the word eofor already existed as an Old Saxon word for wild swine , which is a cognate of the current Low Saxon word <unk> and Dutch ever . The Anglo @-@ Saxon newcomers probably interpreted the <unk> part as eofor , and <unk> as <unk> ( meaning rich ) , while <unk> was ( and is ) a common abbreviation of the Saxon <unk> , meaning home . To them , it sounded as a ' home rich in boar ' . As is common in Saxon place names , the <unk> part gradually faded ; <unk> . When the Danish army conquered the city in 866 , its name became Jórvík . 
 Jórvík gradually reduced to York in the centuries following the Norman Conquest , moving from the Middle English <unk> in the 14th century through <unk> in the 16th century to <unk> in the 17th century . The form York was first recorded in the 13th century . Many company and place names , such as the Ebor race meeting , refer to the Roman name . The Archbishop of York uses Ebor as his surname in his signature . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 Archaeological evidence suggests that Mesolithic people settled in the region of York between 8000 and 7000 BC , although it is not known whether their settlements were permanent or temporary . By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain , the area was occupied by a tribe known to the Romans as the Brigantes . The Brigantian tribal area initially became a Roman client state , but , later its leaders became more hostile and the Roman Ninth Legion was sent north of the Humber into Brigantian territory . 
 The city was founded in 71 AD , when the Ninth Legion conquered the Brigantes and constructed a wooden military fortress on flat ground above the River Ouse close to its confluence with the River Foss . The fortress , which was later rebuilt in stone , covered an area of 50 acres ( 20 ha ) and was inhabited by 6 @,@ 000 soldiers . The site of the Roman fortress lies under the foundations of York Minster , and excavations in the undercroft have revealed some of the original walls . 
 The Emperors Hadrian , Septimius Severus and Constantius I all held court in York during their various campaigns . During his stay , the Emperor Severus proclaimed York capital of the province of Britannia Inferior , and it is likely that it was he who granted York the privileges of a colonia or city . Constantius I died in 306 AD during his stay in York , and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress . 
 While the Roman colonia and fortress were located on high ground , by 400 AD the town was victim to periodic flooding from the Rivers Ouse and Foss and was abandoned . York declined in the post @-@ Roman era , and was taken and settled by the Angles in the 5th century . 
 Reclamation of the flooded parts of the town was initiated in the 7th century under King Edwin of Northumbria , and York became his chief city . The first minster church was built in York for the baptism of Edwin in 627 . Edwin ordered the small wooden church be rebuilt in stone but was killed in 633 and the task of completing the stone minster fell to his successor Oswald . In the following century Alcuin of York came to the cathedral school of York . He had a long career as a teacher and scholar , first at the school at York now known as St Peter 's School , founded in 627 AD , and later as Charlemagne 's leading advisor on ecclesiastical and educational affairs . 
 In 866 , Northumbria was in the midst of internecine struggles when the Vikings raided and captured York . Under Viking rule the city became a major river port , part of the extensive Viking trading routes throughout northern Europe . The last ruler of an independent Jórvík , Eric Bloodaxe , was driven from the city in 954 AD by King Eadred in his successful attempt to complete the unification of England . 
 = = = Post conquest = = = 
 In 1068 , two years after the Norman Conquest of England , the people of York rebelled . Initially the rebellion was successful but upon the arrival of William the Conqueror the rebellion was put down . William at once built a wooden fortress on a motte . In 1069 , after another rebellion , William built another timbered castle across the River Ouse . These were destroyed in 1069 and rebuilt by William about the time of his ravaging Northumbria in what is called the " Harrying of the North " where he destroyed everything from York to Durham . The remains of the rebuilt castles , now in stone , are visible on either side of the River Ouse . See Peter Rex 's The English Resistance , The Underground War Against the Normans , 2006 . 
 The first stone minster church was badly damaged by fire in the uprising and the Normans built a minster on a new site . Around the year 1080 Archbishop Thomas started building the cathedral that in time became the current Minster . In the 12th century York started to prosper . In 1190 , York Castle was the site of an infamous massacre of its Jewish inhabitants , in which at least 150 Jews died ( although some authorities put the figure as high as 500 ) . 
 The city , through its location on the River Ouse and its proximity to the Great North Road became a major trading centre . King John granted the city 's first charter in 1212 , confirming trading rights in England and Europe . During the later Middle Ages York merchants imported wine from France , cloth , wax , canvas , and oats from the Low Countries , timber and furs from the Baltic and exported grain to Gascony and grain and wool to the Low Countries . York became a major cloth manufacturing and trading centre . Edward I further stimulated the city 's economy by using the city as a base for his war in Scotland . The city was the location of significant unrest during the so @-@ called Peasants ' Revolt in 1381 . The city acquired an increasing degree of autonomy from central government including the privileges granted by a charter of Richard II in 1396 . 
 = = = 16th to 18th centuries = = = 
 The city underwent a period of economic decline during Tudor times . Under Henry VIII , the Dissolution of the Monasteries saw the end of York 's many monastic houses , including several orders of friars , the hospitals of St Nicholas and of St Leonard , the largest such institution in the north of England . This led to the Pilgrimage of Grace , an uprising of northern Catholics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire opposed to religious reform . Henry VIII restored his authority by establishing the Council of the North in York in the dissolved St Mary 's Abbey . The city became a trading and service centre during this period . 
 Guy Fawkes , who was born and educated in York , was a member of a group of Roman Catholic <unk> that planned the Gunpowder Plot . Its aim was to displace Protestant rule by blowing up the Houses of Parliament while King James I , the entire Protestant , and even most of the Catholic aristocracy and nobility were inside . 
 In 1644 , during the Civil War , the Parliamentarians besieged York , and many medieval houses outside the city walls were lost . The barbican at Walmgate Bar was undermined and explosives laid , but , the plot was discovered . On the arrival of Prince Rupert , with an army of 15 @,@ 000 men , the siege was lifted . The Parliamentarians retreated some 6 miles ( 10 km ) from York with Rupert in pursuit , before turning on his army and soundly defeating it at the Battle of Marston Moor . Of Rupert 's 15 @,@ 000 troops , no fewer than 4 @,@ 000 were killed and 1 @,@ 500 captured . The siege was renewed but the city could not hold out for long , and on 15 July surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax . 
 Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , and the removal of the garrison from York in 1688 , the city was dominated by the gentry and merchants , although the clergy were still important . Competition from Leeds and Hull , together with silting of the River Ouse , resulted in York losing its pre @-@ eminent position as a trading centre but the city 's role as the social and cultural centre for wealthy northerners was on the rise . York 's many elegant townhouses , such as the Lord Mayor 's Mansion House and Fairfax House date from this period , as do the Assembly Rooms , the Theatre Royal , and the racecourse . 
 During this general time period , the American city of New York and the colony that contained it were renamed after the Duke of York ( later King James II ) .

 The railway promoter George Hudson was responsible for bringing the railway to York in 1839 . Although Hudson 's career as a railway entrepreneur ended in disgrace and bankruptcy , his promotion of his own railway company , the York and North Midland Railway and of York over Leeds , helped establish York as a major railway centre by the late 19th century . 
 The introduction of the railways established engineering in the city . At the turn of the 20th century , the railway accommodated the headquarters and works of the North Eastern Railway , which employed more than 5 @,@ 500 people . The railway was instrumental in the expansion of Rowntree 's Cocoa Works . It was founded in 1862 by Henry Isaac Rowntree , who was joined in 1869 by his brother the philanthropist Joseph . Another chocolate manufacturer , Terry 's of York was a major employer . By 1900 the railways and confectionery had become the city 's two major industries . 
 With the emergence of tourism , the historic core of York became one of the city 's major assets , and in 1968 it was designated a conservation area . The existing tourist attractions were supplemented by the establishment of the National Railway Museum in York in 1975 and the Jorvik Viking Centre in 1984 . The opening of the University of York in 1963 added to the prosperity of the city . 
 In 2010 , the former headquarters on the North Eastern Railway were refurbished and opened as York 's first , and still only , 5 @-@ star hotel - currently known as The Grand Hotel & Spa . 
 York was voted European Tourism City of the Year by European Cities Marketing in June 2007 beating 130 other European cities to gain first place , surpassing Gothenburg in Sweden ( second ) and Valencia in Spain ( third ) . York was also voted safest place to visit in the 2010 <unk> <unk> readers traveller awards .

 From 1997 to 2010 the central part of the district was covered by the City of York constituency , while the remainder was split between the constituencies of Ryedale , Selby , and Vale of York . These constituencies were represented by Hugh Bayley , John Greenway , John Grogan , and Anne McIntosh respectively . 
 Following their review in 2003 of parliamentary representation in North Yorkshire , the Boundary Commission for England recommended the creation of two new seats for the City of York , in time for the general election in 2010 . These are York Central , which covers the inner urban area , and is entirely surrounded by the York Outer constituency . 
 The whole of the city and local council area lies within the Yorkshire and the Humber constituency of the European Parliament . 
 = = = Local government = = = 
 York is the traditional county town of Yorkshire , yet it did not form part of any of its three historic ridings , or divisions . York is an ancient borough , and was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 to form a municipal borough . It gained the status of a county borough in 1889 , under the Local Government Act 1888 , and existed so until 1974 , when , under the Local Government Act 1972 , it became a non @-@ metropolitan district in the county of North Yorkshire . 
 As a result of 1990s UK local government reform , York regained unitary status and saw a substantial alteration in its borders , taking in parts of Selby and Harrogate districts , and about half the population of the Ryedale district . The new boundary was imposed after central government rejected the former city council 's own proposal . 
 The City of York Council has 47 councillors . As a result of the 2015 local elections the Labour Party was reduced to 15 seats . The Liberal Democrats had twelve councillors . The Conservative Party had 14 councillors and the Greens had four with two Independents . 
 City of York Council operates on a leader and Cabinet style of governance . Councillors are appointed to the cabinet by the full council of 47 members . Cabinet members make decisions on their portfolio areas individually . 
 York 's Right Honourable Lord Mayor for 2014 – 15 is Councillor Ian Gillies . The Sheriff is John Kenny . Both appointments are made each May for a period of one year . Although York 's Sheriff office is the oldest in England it is now a purely ceremonial post . The Lord Mayor carries out civic and ceremonial duties in addition to chairing full meetings of the council . 
 The York Youth Council consists of several young people who negotiate with the councillors to get better facilities for York 's young people .

 = = = Location = = = 
 The city is 21 miles ( 34 km ) from Leeds . 
 York lies in the Vale of York , a flat area of fertile arable land bordered by the Pennines , the North York Moors and the Yorkshire Wolds The city was built at the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and Foss on a terminal moraine left by the last Ice Age . 
 During Roman times , the land surrounding the rivers Ouse and Foss was marshy , making the site easy to defend . The city is prone to flooding from the River Ouse , and has an extensive ( and until 2015 mostly effective ) network of flood defences with walls along the river , and a <unk> barrier across the River Foss where it joins the Ouse at the ' Blue Bridge ' . In October and November 2000 York experienced the worst flooding in 375 years with more than 300 homes flooded . In December 2015 the flooding was more extensive and caused major disruption . The extreme impact led to a personal visit by Prime Minister David Cameron . Much land in and around the city is on flood plains too flood @-@ prone for development other than agriculture . The <unk> are flood meadows along the Ouse , while the strays are open common grassland in various locations around the city . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 York Minster , the largest Gothic cathedral in Northern Europe , dominates the city . 
 York Castle , a complex of buildings ranging from the medieval Clifford 's Tower to the 20th century entrance to the York Castle Museum ( formerly a prison ) has had a chequered history . 
 York 's centre is enclosed by the city 's medieval walls , which are a popular walk . These defences are the most complete in England . They have the only walls set on high ramparts and they retain all their principal gateways . They incorporate part of the walls of the Roman fortress and some Norman and medieval work , as well as 19th- and 20th @-@ century renovations . The entire circuit is approximately 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 km ) , and encloses an area of 263 acres ( 106 ha ) . The north @-@ east section includes a part where walls never existed , because the Norman moat of York Castle , formed by damming the River Foss , also created a lake which acted as a city defence . This lake was later called the King 's Fishpond , as the rights to fish belonged to the Crown . 
 A feature of central York is the <unk> , narrow pedestrian routes , many of which led towards the former market @-@ places in Pavement and St Sampson 's Square . The Shambles is a narrow medieval street , lined with shops , boutiques and tea rooms . Most of these premises were once butchers ' shops , and the hooks from which carcasses were hung and the shelves on which meat was laid out can still be seen outside some of them . The street also contains the Shrine of Margaret Clitherow , although it is not located in the house where she lived . <unk> has many medieval houses including the early 14th century Lady Row built to finance a Chantry , at the edge of the churchyard of Holy Trinity church . 
 As well as the Castle Museum , the city contains numerous other museums and historic buildings such as the Yorkshire Museum and its Museum Gardens , Jorvik Viking Centre , the York Art Gallery , the Richard III Museum , the Merchant Adventurers ' Hall , the reconstructed medieval house Barley Hall ( owned by the York Archaeological Trust ) , the 18th century Fairfax House , the Mansion House ( the historic home of the Lord Mayor ) , and the so @-@ called Treasurer 's House ( owned by the National Trust ) . The National Railway Museum is situated just beyond the station , and is home to a vast range of transport material and the largest collection of railway locomotives in the world . Included in this collection are the world 's fastest steam locomotive LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard and the world famous LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman , which has been overhauled in the Museum . Although noted for its Medieval history , visitors can also gain an understanding of the Cold War through visiting York Cold War Bunker , former headquarters of No 20 Group of the Royal Observer Corps . 
 York is noted for its numerous churches and pubs . Most of the remaining churches in York are from the medieval period . St William 's College behind the Minster , and <unk> Hall , off <unk> , are former dwelling places of the canons of the Minster . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 York has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons . As with the rest of the Vale of York the city 's climate is drier and warmer than the rest of the Yorkshire and Humberside region . Because of its lowland location York is prone to frosts , fog , and cold winds during winter , spring and very early summer . Snow can fall in winter from December onwards to as late as April but quickly melts . From May to July , York experiences the most sunshine , an average of six hours per day . Extremes recorded at the University of York campus between 1998 and 2010 include a highest temperature of 34 @.@ 5 ° C ( 94 @.@ 1 ° F ) ( Monday 17 July 2006 ) and a lowest temperature of − 16 @.@ 3 ° C ( 2 @.@ 7 ° F ) ( Monday 6 December 2010 ) .

 Today 's economic position is very different from the 1950s , when its prosperity was based on chocolate manufacturing and the railways . This position continued until the early 1980s when 30 % of the workforce were employed by just five employers and 75 % of manufacturing jobs were in four companies . Most industry around the railway has gone , including the carriage works ( known as Asea Brown Boveri or ABB at the time of closure ) , which at its height in the 1880s employed 5 @,@ 500 people but closed in the mid @-@ 1990s .

Since 1974 , Home Office policing in York has been provided by the North Yorkshire Police . The force 's central headquarters for policing York and nearby Selby in Fulford . Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service , whose headquarters is at Northallerton . 
 The city 's first hospital , York County Hospital , opened in 1740 in <unk> funded by public subscription . It closed in 1976 when it was replaced by York Hospital , which opened the same year and gained Foundation status in April 2007 . It has 524 adult inpatient beds and 127 special purpose beds providing general healthcare and some specialist inpatient , <unk> and outpatient services . It is also known as York District Hospital and <unk> . 
 The Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust was formed on 1 July 2006 bringing together South Yorkshire Ambulance Service , West Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and the North and East Yorkshire parts of Tees , East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Service to provide patient transport . Other forms of health care are provided for locally by clinics and surgeries . 
 The city 's first subscription library opened in 1794 . In 1893 the first free public library , the York Library , was built to mark Queen Victoria 's jubilee . The library was on Clifford Street but a new building was erected on Museum Street in 1927 and is still the library today . The library was extended in 1934 and 1938 . 
 Since 1998 waste management has been co @-@ ordinated via the York and North Yorkshire Waste Partnership . York 's Distribution Network Operator for electricity is CE Electric UK ; there are no power stations in the city . Yorkshire Water , which has a local water extraction plant on the River Derwent at Elvington , manages York 's drinking and waste water . 
 The city has a Magistrates ' Court , and a Crown Court and County Court too . The Crown Court House was designed by the architect John Carr , next to the then prison ( including execution area ) . 
 Between 1773 and 1777 , the Grand Jury House was replaced by John Carr 's elegant Court House for the Assizes of the whole county . The Female Prison was built opposite and mirrors the court building positioned around a circular lawn which became known as the " Eye of the Ridings " , or the " Eye of York " .

The culprits of lesser crimes were brought to court by the city constables and would face a fine . The corporation employed a " common informer " whose task was to bring criminals to justice . 
 The former prison is now the Castle Museum but still contains the cells . 
 = = Transport = = 
 York 's location on the River Ouse and in the centre of the Vale of York means that it has always had a significant position in the nation 's transport system . The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the River Ouse and the River Foss . The Ouse was originally a tidal river , accessible to seagoing ships of the time . Today both of these rivers remain navigable , although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence . A lock at <unk> on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal . 
 Until the end of the 20th century , the Ouse was used by barges to carry freight between York and the port of Hull . The last significant traffic was the supply of newsprint to the local newspaper 's Foss @-@ side print works , which continued until 1997 . Today navigation is almost exclusively leisure @-@ oriented . 
 Like most cities founded by the Romans , York is well served by long distance trunk roads . The city lies at the intersection of the A19 road from Doncaster to Tyneside , the A59 road from Liverpool to York , the A64 road from Leeds to Scarborough , and the <unk> road from York to Hull . The A64 road provides the principal link to the motorway network , linking York to both the A1 ( M ) and the M1 motorways at a distance of about 10 miles ( 15 km ) from the city . The <unk> M62 motorway is less than 20 miles ( 30 km ) away providing links to Manchester and Liverpool . 
 The city is surrounded on all sides by an outer ring road , at a distance of some 3 miles ( 5 km ) from the centre of the city , which allows through traffic to by @-@ pass the city . The street plan of the historic core of the city dates from medieval times and is not suitable for modern traffic . As a consequence many of the routes inside the city walls are designated as car free during business hours or restrict traffic entirely .

The sites are located towards the edge of the urban area , with easy access from the ring road , and allow out of town visitors to complete their journey into the city centre by bus .

 Any Human Heart : The Intimate Journals of Logan Mountstuart is a 2002 novel by William Boyd , a British writer . It is written as a lifelong series of journals kept by Mountstuart , a writer whose life ( 1906 – 1991 ) spanned the defining episodes of the 20th century , crossed several continents and included a convoluted sequence of relationships and literary endeavours . Boyd uses the diary form to explore how public events impinge on individual consciousness , so that Mountstuart ’ s journal alludes almost casually to the war , the death of a prime minister or the abdication of the king . Boyd plays ironically on the theme of literary celebrity , introducing his protagonist to several real writers who are included as characters – a spat with Virginia Woolf in London , a possible sexual encounter with Evelyn Waugh at Oxford , a clumsy exchange with James Joyce in Paris , and a friendship with Ernest Hemingway that spans several years . 
 Boyd spent 30 months writing the novel . The journal style , with its gaps , false starts and contradictions , reinforces the theme of the changing self in the novel . Many plot points simply fade away . The novel received mixed reviews from critics on publication , but has sold well . A television adaptation was made with the screenplay written by Boyd , first broadcast in 2010 . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Mountstuart appeared in Boyd 's short story " Hôtel des Voyageurs " written in the early 1990s and published in London Magazine and his 1995 collection The Destiny of Nathalie ' X ' . The story was inspired by the journals written by writer and critic Cyril Connolly in the 1920s . It was written in journal form and was , like Connolly 's journals self obsessed , lyrical and hedonistic . Boyd was obsessed with Connolly as a schoolboy , avidly reading his reviews in The Sunday Times , and later read his entire published œuvre and found his flawed personality ' deeply beguiling ' . 
 In 1988 Boyd had written The New Confessions as a memoir , the hoax biography of an invented artist , Nat Tate : An American Artist 1928 @-@ 1960 , in which Mountstuart reappeared . Boyd claimed that he , as biographer , had first heard of the painter through the work of a little @-@ known British writer , a black @-@ and @-@ white photograph Boyd of whom had found in a French second @-@ hand shop . The caption identified the chubby man as " Logan Mountstuart in 1952 " . Boyd described him as , 
 a curious and forgotten figure in the annals of 20th @-@ century literary life . ‘ A man of letters ’ is probably the only description which does justice to his strange career – by turns acclaimed or wholly indigent . Biographer , <unk> , editor , failed novelist , he was perhaps most successful at happening to be in the right place at the right time during most of the century , and his journal – a huge , copious document – will probably prove his lasting memorial . 
 Boyd distinguished journal , biography and memoir as literary forms , different treatments of the same essential subject , the human condition , the change in medium justified his writing again of a whole @-@ life view : " I don 't think there 's anything wrong with going back over territory you 've previously covered . " 
 Though avowedly not an ( <unk> ) biographical novelist , Boyd acknowledged that personal experiences often subconsciously affect a writer 's fiction . As in several of Boyd 's novels there are parallels with the author 's life : both Boyd and Mountstuart lived in Africa and France , studied at Oxford , worked in literary London and had a taste of New York . Boyd usually splits the creation of a novel into two phases : research and writing . The first phase of Any Human Heart took 30 months as he carefully plotted Mountstuart 's life to be significant but seem random , a period during which he bought several hundred books . He spent another year and a half writing the book . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The book begins with a quotation from Henry James , " Never say you know the last word about any human heart . " A short preface ( an anonymous editor suggests it was written in 1987 ) explains that the earliest pages have been lost , and recounts briefly Mountstuart 's childhood in Montevideo , Uruguay before he moves to England aged seven with his English father and Uruguayan mother . In his final term at school he and two friends set challenges . Logan is to get on to the school 's first XV rugby team ; Peter <unk> has to seduce Tess , a local farmer 's daughter ; and Ben Leeping , a lapsed Jew , has to convert to Roman Catholicism . Mountstuart enters Oxford on an exhibition and leaves with a third in History . Settling in London , he enjoys early success as a writer with The Mind 's <unk> , a critically successful biography of Shelley ; The Girl Factory , a salacious novel about prostitutes ( which is poorly reviewed but sells well ) ; and Les <unk> , a respectable book on some obscure French poets . Mountstuart 's mother loses the family wealth in the Wall Street Crash . He embarks on a series of amorous encounters : he loses his virginity to Tess , is rejected by Land Fothergill whom he met at Oxford , and marries Lottie , an Earl 's daughter . They live together at Thorpe Hall in Norfolk , where Mountstuart , unstimulated by slow country life and his warm but dull wife , becomes idle . 
 He meets Freya whilst on holiday , and begins an affair with her . Just before he departs for Barcelona to report on the Spanish Civil War , Lottie unexpectedly visits his London flat and quickly realises another woman lives with him . On his return to England , following an acrimonious divorce , he marries Freya in Chelsea Town Hall . The newlyweds move to a house in Battersea where Freya gives birth to their daughter , Stella . During The Second World War Mountstuart is recruited into the Naval Intelligence Division by Ian Fleming . He is sent to Portugal to monitor the Duke and Duchess of Windsor ; when they move to the Bahamas , Mountstuart follows , playing golf with the Duke and socialising regularly until the murder of Sir Harry Oakes . Mountstuart suspects the Duke is a conspirator after two hired detectives ask him to incriminate Oakes ' son @-@ in @-@ law with false fingerprint evidence . Mountstuart refuses and is called a " Judas " by the Duchess . Later in the war , Mountstuart is interned in Switzerland for two years . After the war 's end , he is grieved to discover that Freya , thinking him dead , had remarried and then died , along with Stella , in a V @-@ 2 attack . 
 Mountstuart 's life collapses as he seeks refuge in an alcoholic daze to escape his depression . He buys 10b Turpentine Lane , a small basement flat in Pimlico . He returns to Paris to finish his existentialist novella , The Villa by the Lake , staying with his old friend Ben Leeping ( now a successful gallery owner ) . After a failed sexual encounter with <unk> , a young French girl working at Ben 's gallery , he attempts suicide but is surprised by the girl when she returns an hour later for her Zippo lighter . Ben offers Mountstuart a job as manager of his new gallery in New York , " Leeping fils " . Mountstuart mildly prospers in the art scene of the 1960s , meeting artists like Willem de Kooning ( whom he admires ) and Jackson Pollock ( whom he does not ) ; he moves in with an American lawyer , Alannah , and her two young daughters . On his return to London , he has an affair with Gloria , Peter <unk> ' third wife ( Peter has become a successful author of popular novels ) , and in New York with Janet , a gallery owner . He eventually discovers Alannah having her own affair , and the couple split . He reconciles with his son from his first marriage , Lionel , who has moved to New York to manage a pop group , until Lionel 's sudden death . Monday , Lionel 's girlfriend , moves into Mountstuart 's flat ; at first friends , they become intimates until her father turns up and Mountstuart discovers – to his horror – that she is 16 ( having told him she was 19 ) . His lawyer advises him to leave America to avoid prosecution for statutory rape . 
 In the African journal , Mountstuart has become an English lecturer at the University College of <unk> in Nigeria , from where he reports on the Biafran War . He retires to London on a paltry pension and , now an old man , he is knocked over by a speeding post office van . In hospital he brusquely refuses to turn to religion , swearing his atheism and humanism to a priest . He recovers but is now completely destitute . To boost his income and publicise the state of hospitals , he joins the Socialist Patients ' <unk> ( SPK ) , which turns out to be a cell of the Baader @-@ Meinhof Gang . He becomes the SPK 's prize newspaper seller and is sent on a special mission to the continent . The trip ends with a brief interrogation by Special Branch , after which Mountstuart returns to his life of penury in London . With a new appreciation of life , he sells his flat and moves to a small village in the south of France , living in a house bequeathed to him by an old friend . He fits into the village well , introducing himself as an <unk> who is working on a novel called Octet . As he contemplates his past life after the deaths of Peter and Ben , his old school friends , he muses : 
 That 's all your life amounts to in the end : the aggregate of all the good luck and the bad luck you experience . Everything is explained by that simple formula . Tot it up – look at the respective piles . There 's nothing you can do about it : nobody shares it out , allocates it to this one or that , it just happens . We must quietly suffer the laws of man 's condition , as Montaigne says . 
 = = Themes = = 
 = = = Multiple selves = = = 
 Multiplicity of self is introduced early on as a theme , to capture a " more riotous and disorganised reality " , and the use of the journal as the novel 's literary form is explicitly pointed to as developing this theme : " We keep a journal to entrap the collection of selves that forms us , the individual human being " the narrator explains . In an article in The Guardian , Boyd confirmed " this thesis that we are an anthology , a composite of many selves " is a theme of the book . While man 's fundamental nature remains the same , he moves in and out of happiness , love and good health . Wisdom , as with age , is slowly acquired . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 Boyd has previously written about the 20th century through two characters : The New Confessions was a fictional memoir , and Nat Tate a spoof biography . In Any Human Heart , Boyd uses the journal form as a fresh angle to pursue the subject from : " I wanted to invent my own exemplary figure who could seem almost as real as the real ones and whose life followed a similar pattern : boarding school , university , Paris in the 20s , the rise of Fascism , war , post @-@ war neglect , disillusion , increasing <unk> , and so on — a long , varied and <unk> life that covered most of the century . " Boyd sets Mountstuart 's life within its context , tracing the grand arc of events during the 20th century by <unk> Mountstuart as swept along in the flow of history - he serves in World War II , sees the cultural revolution in the 1950s and 60s , and takes advantage of modern transport in his extensive travels around the world . Rather than being re @-@ told in hindsight , their importance in context , historical events are seen through the petty lens of every @-@ day living . For example , in an entry from the 1920s , Mountstuart notes " Coffee with Land Fothergill at the Cadena . She was wearing a velvet coat that matched her eyes . We talked a little stiffly about Mussolini and Italy and I was embarrassed to note how much better informed she was than I. " 
 Boyd said he was partially inspired by the generation of English writers who matured between the wars : " I am fascinated by the life and work of that generation of English writers who were born at the beginning of the century and reached maturity by the time of World War II . People like Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene and Anthony Powell , obviously , but also less well known writers — Henry Green , Lawrence Durrell , Cyril Connolly and William Gerhardie . The last two in particular lurk closely behind Logan . " Both real and imagined characters are blended into this context , where historical personages are typically used to concentrate the historical significance of a novel 's plot , Mountstuart 's encounters with them are superficial , leaving only an impression of both parties ' small @-@ mindedness . John Mullan found the conceit most effective during the New York journal , where Boyd satirises figures in the Abstract Expressionist movement during the 1950s " whose characters seem almost beyond invention . " 
 = = Genre and style = = 
 The novel is narrated in the first person through a series of nine <unk> <unk> , kept by Mountstuart from age 17 until shortly before his death at 85 . French literary journals , always published posthumously , are often extremely candid accounts , particularly of the author 's sexual life . Boyd , himself a francophile , includes masturbation , prostitution and Mountstuart 's three marriages . While Boyd had earlier written work in the form of memoir or biography , a journal is different : " For a start , it 's written without the benefit of hindsight , so there isn 't the same feeling you get when you look back and add shape to a life . There are huge chunks missing . " The novel 's grounding in everyday life and focus on characterisation place it firmly within realism . 
 Each journal covers a different period of Mountstuart 's life , and they are usually geographically named : The School Journal , London I , etc . Boyd varied the narrator 's tone in each to demonstrate changes in Mountstuart 's character . In the first London Journal he is , according to Boyd , a " modernist aesthete " , becoming a " world @-@ weary cynic " in New York and finding " serene and elegiac serenity " in the final French journal . To support the book 's historical themes and documentary premise , there is a feigned editorial apparatus : an index listing real people and their relation to Mountstuart alongside fictional characters , an editor 's introduction ( by Boyd ) , an authorial preface ( by Mountstuart ) and a list of works attributed to Mountstuart . An additional stylistic feature is the anonymous editor ( Boyd ) , who introduces the book and offers explanatory footnotes , cross @-@ references and attempts at dating . Since a journal is written from the perspective of each day , Mountstuart 's moods change as events affect him . The form lends itself to " <unk> " , since the author / narrator inevitably cannot see the overall structure of the story . Plot lines which " fizzle and fade " emphasise the theme of multiple selves throughout life . Boyd adds other aspects to the work , such as parenthetical musings that are never answered , to re @-@ enforce the style . His tone of voice gradually changes as he ages : Boyd wanted the style to reflect the major theme that we change and grow throughout life : " I wanted the literary tone of each journal to reflect this and so the voice subtly changes as you read on : from pretentious school boy to modern young decadent , to bitter realist to drink soaked cynic , to sage and serene octogenarian , and so forth . " 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Richard Eder praised Any Human Heart in the New York Times : " William Boyd , is multifaceted and inventive , and he plays a deep game under his agile card tricks . " Christopher Tayler , in the London Review of Books , called the characterisation of Mountstuart weak and wondered if he was merely a device through which Boyd could write pastiche about 20th @-@ century writers , " Boyd hustles you through to the end despite all this , but it ’ s hard not to wonder if it was really worth making the journey . " In The Atlantic Monthly , Brooke Allen liked the Mountstuart character : " he is far more generous , forgiving , and free than most of us . He is also more amusing , and more amused by life " , thus making an " attractive central character " and Boyd 's writing showed " a great natural vitality and an increasingly sophisticated humanism . " The Atlantic Monthly selected it as one of the " books of the year " . 
 In The Observer , Tim Adams complimented the opening sections as " nicely layered with the pretensions of a particular precocious kind of student " but criticised the " predictability " of Mountstuart 's " walk @-@ on part in literary history " and ultimately the suspension of disbelief , particularly the Baader @-@ Meinhoff passages , concluding " For all the incident , for all the change he witnesses , Mountstuart never really feels like a credible witness either to history or emotion . " Tom Cox in The Daily Telegraph disagreed : he praised the characterisation , calling Mountstuart " a man whose fragile egotism and loose @-@ fitting story has you frequently forgetting you 're reading fiction , and even more frequently forgetting you 're reading at all . " Giles Foden , in The Guardian , found the New York art @-@ scene sections weakest , saying they " puncture the realism Boyd has so carefully built up in the rest of the novel . " Michiko Kakutani agreed that Mountstuart 's youth was well evoked , but that the description of his retirement and poverty was " as carefully observed and emotionally resonant " . While in the early part of the book " the characters ' marionette strings [ are ] carefully hidden " , later Boyd tried to play God , resulting in " an increasingly contrived narrative that begins to strain our credulity . " 
 Boyd spends his summer in the south of France and has a large audience there , and several French journals noted the publication of Any Human <unk> <unk> called Boyd a " magician " , while Le Nouvel Observateur called it " very good Boyd . Perhaps even his magnum opus . " 
 The novel was in the longlist of the Man Booker Prize in 2002 , and on the shortlist of the Dublin <unk> Literary Award in 2004 . In 2009 , Boyd commented , " [ it ] didn 't get particularly good reviews , yet I 've never had so many letters about a novel .

 = Tropical Storm Matmo ( 2008 ) = 
 Severe Tropical Storm Matmo , known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Dindo , formed to the east of Manila in the Philippines as a tropical disturbance on May 13 , 2008 . Early the next day , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the developing system while later that day the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the disturbance as a weak tropical depression and started to issue advisories on it . The JTWC then designated the depression as Tropical Depression 04W while the JMA started to issue full advisories on the storm . On May 15 , the tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm and was named Matmo by RSMC Tokyo . Later that day the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration issued their first advisory on Matmo and assigned the local name Dindo . The JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm later that day . It then intensified into a severe tropical storm the next day while the JTWC issued their final advisory on Matmo as they thought the storm had become extratropical . However , the JMA kept issuing advisories on Matmo , until the storm dissipated the next day . There was no impact reported from Tropical Storm Matmo . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Late on May 13 , 2008 , a tropical disturbance formed about 550 km ( 340 mi ) , to the east of Manila in the Philippines . The disturbance was located in an area of low vertical wind shear and had a low @-@ level circulation center which had started to consolidate . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) then issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance early the next day , as deep convection was building near to the low pressure area . Later that day both the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression , with the JTWC designating it as Tropical Depression 04W . This was because the system had become more consolidated and had a good outflow . 
 Early on May 15 , as the storm was moving towards the northwest , the JMA upgraded the tropical depression to a Tropical Storm and named it Matmo . The Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) then designated the storm as Tropical Depression Dindo . Later that day Matmo rapidly tracked towards the northeastern boundary of PAGASA 's area of responsibility as it had started to interact with a mid @-@ latitude trough . The JTWC then reported that the cyclone had intensified into a tropical storm and had reached its peak intensity with winds of 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) . Early on May 16 , both PAGASA and the JTWC issued their final advisories on the storm as it approached the edge of PAGASA 's Area of responsibility , with the JTWC reporting that Matmo was now extratropical . However , the JMA continued to issue advisories on the storm at this time and reported that it had reached ten @-@ minute peak wind speeds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) , which made Matmo a severe tropical storm . Though , within their next advisory , the JMA downgraded Matmo to a tropical storm and reported that it had weakened into a tropical depression early the next day before dissipating later that day . 
 = = Preparations , impact and naming = = 
 In preparation for Tropical Storm Matmo , the Japan Meteorological Agency issued warnings for the , Naha , Moji and Yokohama areas of Japan . However , there was no impact reported from either Japan or the Philippines . 
 The name Matmo was submitted to the ESCAP / WMO Typhoon Committee , by the United States of America , for use from January 1 , 2004 and means heavy rain in the Chamorro language . This came after the name Chataan was retired , following the 2002 Pacific typhoon season . The Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) also assigned the local name of Dindo to Matmo , which was last assigned by PAGASA , in the 2004 Pacific typhoon season . 
 = Pennsylvania Ministerium = 
 The Pennsylvania Ministerium was the first Lutheran church body in North America . With the encouragement of Henry Melchior Muhlenberg , the Ministerium was founded at a Church Conference of Lutheran clergy on August 26 , 1748 . The group was known as the " Ministerium of North America " until 1792 , when it adopted the name " The Ministerium of Pennsylvania and Adjacent States . " 
 The Pennsylvania Ministerium was also the source of the first Lutheran liturgy in America . Because of its unique place in the history of North American Lutheranism , the Ministerium continued to influence the church politics of Lutherans in America into the twentieth century . 
 = = Lutherans in North America = = 
 In 1638 , Swedish settlers , colonizing north along the Delaware from the New Sweden colony , established residences in what would become Philadelphia , at a place called <unk> by the local Lenape tribe , meaning " pleasant place " . These Swedish settlers were Lutheran . The Gloria Dei ( Old Swedes ’ ) Church was completed in 1700 . Colonization extended to present @-@ day Trenton . 
 German settlers began arriving in North America in the mid @-@ seventeenth century . They were particularly attracted by William Penn 's promise of religious freedom in the colony of Pennsylvania , and came to the Philadelphia region in significant numbers . By 1683 , the German population was large enough to form communities such as Germantown ( now a neighborhood in Philadelphia ) . Many of these immigrants brought with them their Lutheran faith and formed congregations in their new homeland . 
 = = Ministerium Founding = = 
 By the mid @-@ eighteenth century , there was a growing need for well @-@ trained Lutheran clergy in the colonies . With the goal of creating closer union between the preachers , elders , and deacons of the area congregations , a conference was proposed . 
 The <unk> foundation at the University of Halle in Germany sent 24 clergymen to minister in the colonies in 1742 . Among those sent was Henry Melchior Muhlenberg . Tension between pious and orthodox religious interpretations was present in Europe and North American Lutherans at this time . The conference intentionally excluded congregations critical of pious interpretation . A conference was assembled , but disrupted by the orthodox Swedish preacher Rev. <unk> , of New Sweden colony . Tension around this conference extended beyond Pennsylvania . Open remarks from William C. <unk> against John C. Hartwick of New York were published in a booklet . Carl M. Wrangel was criticised by his Swedish colleagues in Delaware for having <unk> leanings . 
 Five years later , a conference was again assembled . At Muhlenberg 's request , Lutheran pastors met together in Philadelphia on August 26 , 1748 , for the first Church Conference . Six pastors and lay representatives from ten congregations attended the meeting , where they agreed to work together as the " <unk> of North America . " They successfully adopted a common liturgy to be used in North America . This meeting has become known as " the most important event in the history of North American Lutheranism . " Attendees came from Philadelphia , New Hanover , Providence , Germantown , Tulpehocken , Lancaster , Upper Milford , and <unk> congregations . 
 The fifteenth Church Conference , of 1762 , led by Muhlenberg , was held at St Michael 's Church , Philadelphia . Four Swedish and ten German preachers represented area congregations . 
 Muhlenberg 's influence went beyond those congregations he served ; he organized other Lutheran congregations in Pennsylvania so that they might work in cooperation . Such was his influence that Muhlenberg became regarded to be " the patriarch of the Lutheran church in North America . 
 The Ministerium remained a relatively informal association until a constitution was drawn up and agreed upon in 1781 . Along with a formal constitution , it adopted the name of the " German Evangelical Lutheran Ministerium of North America . " The churches of the <unk> followed a polity influenced by the Dutch Reformed model and by Muhlenberg 's Pietism , and did not insist on strict adherence to the Lutheran Confessions . During these early years , there were not only German pastors , but also Swedish pastors in the Ministerium . Members of the Ministerium could be found in Pennsylvania , New York , New Jersey , Maryland , Virginia , and even the Carolinas . 
 In 1784 , Frederick A. Muhlenberg ( second son of the earlier patriarch ) organized the growing number of Lutheran congregations and clergy in the state of New York into the Ministerium of New York . Mindful of this and other Lutheran church bodies being founded in North America , in 1792 the group in Philadelphia renamed itself " The Ministerium of Pennsylvania and Adjacent States " . 
 = = General Synod = = 
 In 1818 , the Pennsylvania Ministerium began talks of organizing the various Lutheran church bodies in America , so that they could " stand in some or another in closer connection with one another . " At a meeting in Hagerstown , Maryland in October 1820 , just such an organization was founded in the General Synod ( formally titled the " Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of the United States of North America " ) . At the outset , this group consisted of the Pennsylvania Ministerium , along with the New York Ministerium and the Maryland @-@ Virginia Synod . 
 The General Synod served largely in an advisory function — each church body within the Synod retained its own constitution and independence . The primary role of the Synod was to facilitate cooperation among the various church bodies . It was under the auspices of the General Synod , with the leadership of Samuel Simon Schmucker , that a Lutheran seminary and college were founded in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . 
 Despite its role in establishing the General Synod , the Pennsylvania Ministerium withdrew from the inter @-@ Lutheran organization in 1823 . Within the Ministerium , there was a close relationship between Lutheran and Reformed congregations , and many felt that the General Synod might jeopardize that relationship . In addition , many in the Ministerium were wary of a centralized organization , and the control that it might exert over individual congregations . 
 Thus , in the years following , the Pennsylvania Ministerium remained an independent Lutheran church body . However , the Ministerium sought to maintain a relationship with the Synod , including continuing to send its ministerial students to the General Synod 's seminary in Gettysburg , which was headed by Samuel Schmucker . 
 In the decades that followed , the Ministerium became less concerned with its relationship with the Reformed church and saw a significant increase in Lutheran identity and the importance of the Lutheran Confessions . Thus , in 1853 , the Ministerium rejoined other Lutherans in the General Synod . However , this renewed relationship would prove to be short @-@ lived . 
 = = General Council = = 
 As with many Protestant churches , the General Synod was split on the issue of the American Civil War in the 1860s . Yet this was not the biggest challenge to Lutheran unity in the middle of the 19th century . As the importance of the Lutheran Confessions grew among American Lutherans , Samuel Schmucker — who was once seen <unk> conservative — found himself on the outside of the consensus of other Lutherans . In 1855 , Schmucker , along with two other theologians from the Gettysburg seminary , penned the Definite <unk> Platform . This document downplayed the importance of the Confessions — indeed even suggested an edited " American Recension " of the Augsburg Confession — and sought to establish a distinctly American Lutheranism that was more at home with other Protestants in the country . 
 The Definite <unk> Platform was not enough to cause the Pennsylvania Ministerium to leave the General Synod , but it was a foretaste of things to come . When the <unk> Synod , a Lutheran church body noted for its progressive politics and its utter disregard for the Lutheran Confessions , was admitted to the General Synod , the leadership of the Ministerium had seen enough . At the 1864 gathering of the General Synod , at which the <unk> were admitted , the delegates from the Ministerium left in protest . Unfortunately , the delegates left before the General Synod passed a resolution affirming and strengthening their commitment to the Augsburg Confession . 
 It is not clear whether the members of the Ministerium intended for this to be a permanent break , or a temporary protest . Regardless , it became permanent when the officials at the next Gathering of the General Synod refused to admit the delegates from the Ministerium . Thus , the Ministerium found themselves on their own . 
 In 1864 , unhappy with the direction of the General Synod and its seminary at Gettysburg , the Ministerium established a new seminary in Philadelphia , and asked Charles Porterfield <unk> to head the seminary ( now known as the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia ) . This was followed , in 1867 , with the Ministerium being joined by thirteen other church bodies in a more conservative and confessional organization known as the General Council . 
 = = United Lutheran Church in America = = 
 The Pennsylvania Ministerium remained a constituent church of the General Council from 1867 – 1918 . In 1918 , following the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the Reformation , the three Lutheran church bodies of Eastern America ( The General Synod , the General Synod – South , and the General Council ) reunited to form the United Lutheran Church in America . This event , while marking a watershed of unity among American Lutherans , also marked the end of the Pennsylvania Ministerium . The <unk> would later join with other American Lutherans , in 1962 in the Lutheran Church in America , and in 1988 in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ( which continues to be an active church body and is a direct descendant of the Pennsylvania Ministerium ) . 
 = Uncle David = 
 Uncle David is a 2010 British black comedy film directed by David Hoyle , Gary Reich , and Mike Nicholls . It was produced by Reich and stars Hoyle , an English performance artist , in the titular role alongside English pornographic actor Ashley Ryder .

 According to The Guardian , Hoyle became " something of a legend " on the British cabaret circuit during the 1990s , initially under the alter @-@ ego of " The Divine David " . The Divine David was an " anti @-@ drag queen " who combined " lacerating social commentary " with " breathtaking instances of self @-@ recrimination and even self @-@ harm . " Taking this character to television , Hoyle produced two shows for Channel 4 , The Divine David Presents ( 1999 ) and The Divine David <unk> ( 2000 ) , before killing off the character at a farewell show at Streatham Ice Arena , South London , titled The Divine David on Ice ( 2000 ) . Independently , Hoyle appeared in the film Velvet Goldmine ( 1998 ) and the television series Nathan Barley ( 2005 ) . 
 Ryder had hoped to be a fashion designer , undertaking a course at Central Saint Martins which he did not complete ; from there he worked in retail , first for Prowler and then for the designer Vivienne Westwood . Subsequently appearing in gay pornography as a <unk> bottom for production companies like <unk> and UK Naked Men , he starred in such films as Drunk on Spunk and Stretch that Hole , winning numerous awards for his work . By the time he made Uncle David , he was also running his own weekly gay wrestling night in London . 
 Hoyle and Ryder met at a performance art event , after which the former asked Ryder if he would appear in one of his stage shows . Ryder was busy at the time , but agreed to the request several years later . Staged at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern ( <unk> ) , a gay bar in Vauxhall , South London , the duo constructed a piece in which Ryder played the role of Hoyle 's nephew in an ad @-@ lib performance . Hoyle played a department store Santa Claus while Ryder portrayed a misbehaving nine @-@ year @-@ old . The performance ended in Hoyle 's Santa character pulling Christmas tinsel from the child 's anus before strangling him . 
 Reich – who had known Hoyle since the late 1990s – was in the audience , and enjoyed the chemistry between the two actors , suggesting that they appear in a feature film together . Over the course of a day , he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder , in which they explored some of the scenarios and themes that made it into Uncle David . In these shorts Hoyle wore a wig and makeup , which were omitted from the later feature . The two actors continued to develop their characters through a series of text messages and phone conversations . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Uncle David was filmed over five days in October 2009 on the Isle of Sheppey , a location chosen for its proximity to London . Hoyle commented that the profusion of barbed wire fences there made him wonder if they were " keeping people out or keeping people in ? " . Reich said that he had been " obsessed " with Sheppey , a place he had considered " a truly <unk> wasteland " since working on a television show there ten years previously . He remarked that the " trailer trash setting " of the film was influenced by Harmony Korine 's Gummo ( 1997 ) and John Waters ' Female Trouble ( 1974 ) . He also said that the filming budget of under £ 1000 was a homage to " the spirit of John Waters . " All the extras featured in the film were real inhabitants of Sheppey , and to film a scene in a local cafe , they walked in and asked the proprietors if they could shoot there . Although they had planned to tell any enquirers who approached them that they were shooting a horror film , during the shoot none of the locals expressed any interest in the crew 's activities . 
 The caravan park was largely empty at the time , and closed for winter several days after filming ended . Both actors and crew slept in the same caravan in which the film was set . Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan , which had eight people inside it during filming ; he felt that it was " quite hectic but [ had ] a great atmosphere " . Throughout filming , Hoyle and Ryder remained in character , improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script . Hoyle told a reporter that they " wanted everything to feel like real time ... As soon as you woke up , the cameras would be on you . I look knackered . " During filming , he contracted swine flu , but insisted that all he needed was a 30 @-@ minute break before filming , attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline . He noted that " I just said , ' No , no , no . We 'll carry on . I 'll just stop eating . ' I was completely purged during the making of that film . Afterwards , during the edit , I started to feel a lot calmer . " Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic , noting that " When I was 14 , I had – let 's call it an existential crisis . I wondered if [ Uncle David ] was a case of me destroying that part of me . If you do have a breakdown that young , for the rest of your life you 're very aware of it . It can make you feel your foundations are a little bit shaky . It 's a devastating experience but we revisited it . I just went with my instincts and intuition . " 
 The footage was captured on two Sony <unk> @-@ Z1 camcorders . Costumes had been purchased at an Oxfam charity shop in Dalston , East London , while a wig worn by Ashley in one scene was purchased from a Dalston wig store . Knowing that he would appear nude in several scenes , Ryder went to the gym regularly in the weeks proceeding filming to gain greater muscle tone . He decided to include footage from one of his pornographic videos in Uncle David , inspired to do so after learning that serial killers Fred and Rosemary West screened pornography throughout the day in their home . 
 The composer Richard Thomas , co @-@ creator of the controversial Jerry Springer : The Opera , agreed to produce a musical score for the film , having long been a fan of Hoyle 's work . After the cast and crew listened to a Muse album while driving between locations , they decided to include the band 's work as they felt it was " empowering " . They had also planned to include a song by Antony and the Johnsons in the film , but this was scrapped , to be replaced by a track by Boy George . After the film was screened for Boy George , the first person outside the Avant @-@ Garde Alliance to see it , he commented " well it ain 't The Sound of Music " .

 Uncle David premiered on 25 March 2010 at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival held in the BFI Southbank in central London . Attending the screening was Steve Marmion , the boss of Soho Theatre , who suggested to Reich and Hoyle that they produce a theatrical adaptation of the film . They initially showed an interest in the project ; Reich commented that " It was a very mischievous concept , doing an upbeat , life @-@ affirming song @-@ and @-@ dance musical with that storyline and subject matter . " However , the theatrical adaptation never surfaced , something Thomas attributed to the difficulty in obtaining funding for a musical on such a " dark subject . " Instead , Hoyle and Thomas teamed up to produce Merrie Hell , an " alternative Christmas celebration " that appeared at the Soho Theatre in December 2012 . A two @-@ man cabaret that differed every night , it featured Thomas on a piano , accompanying Hoyle 's rendition of various songs about Christmas and Britain 's societal problems ; Thomas described it as " David Hoyle at Christmas - the Musical " . One of the songs featured in Merrie Hell , " It 's Alright to Want to Die " , carried a pro @-@ suicide theme influenced by Uncle David .

 In December 2011 , Uncle David was released as a Region Free DVD by the company <unk> Pictures , a UK based film distributor of art house , gay and lesbian , independent and world cinema . The release contained several extras , including the three preparatory shorts detailing the relationship between the characters of Ashley and Uncle David and a cast commentary track voiced by Hoyle , Ryder , Reich and Nicholls . Reviewing the DVD release for the Sex Gore Mutants website , Stuart Willis noted that the disc contained periods of " murkiness or softness in the picture " and a few " ( infrequent ) instances of muffling " , all of which he put down to the original production values of the film . British gay magazine Attitude celebrated the DVD 's release with a competition to win one of three copies ; they described the film as " a bit surreal , but totally amazing . "

Reich expressed surprise at the Erotic Award , because he did not consider the film to be a work of erotica , but discovered that they 'd won because they had explored " an extreme fetish that to be honest we 'd not actually heard of nor knew we were exploring . " 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 Reviews of Uncle David were mixed . Writing in The Guardian , Ben Walters noted that " suspense and dread accumulate as the low @-@ key naturalism and the characters ' obvious affection for one another play off against the enormity of what looms ahead . " Comparing Uncle David to Hoyle 's earlier stage work , he felt that the two were " consistent " , but that in the film Hoyle abandoned the " fireworks of his performance persona " , opting for a " controlled , beguiling style " . He believed that Ryder 's familiarity with being filmed meant that he carried a " disarmingly ingenuous presence , by turns determined and naive . " Walters opined that the film 's " menacing " use of British seaside locations was similar to that in Brighton Rock and London to Brighton , while he also drew comparisons to Badlands , Bonnie and Clyde and The Talented Mr. Ripley , in that in all of them , the viewers ' sympathy for the characters eclipses moral judgement of their actions . Walters would follow this with another review published in Time Out , in which he awarded the film five stars out of five . 
 " Not to everyone 's taste , granted , [ Uncle David ] is nevertheless an original and disturbing take on modern love stories " was the view of Stuart Willis writing for the Sex @-@ Gore @-@ Mutants website . Believing that the film was a " pleasant surprise " , he praised the improvised nature of the work , believing that it created believable scenes and allowed the viewer to get to know the characters " almost without realising . " He considered the acting to be very good , and particularly praised Hoyle 's ability to portray a paedophile grooming a young man in a way that was both " pathetic and truly sinister all at once " . Rather than falling into " tasteless exploitation " , Willis thought that the film was saved by a lack of sensationalism . Praising the exterior scenes as " beautifully atmospheric " and the music as " fitting the laconic mood and sense of ill @-@ foreboding well " , he considered the film to be a good example of low @-@ key filmmaking , akin to that produced in Britain during the early 1980s . 
 Other reviewers were far more critical . Writing for the So So Gay website , Damien Ryan gave Uncle David a rating of 0 @.@ 5 out of 5 , describing it as " terrible " . Believing that the film simply intended to shock viewers with its taboo subject matter , he felt offended by the story 's " sheer inelegance " . Opining that it reminded him of " the very worst attempt of a first @-@ year film student " , he questioned the description of Uncle David as a " black comedy " , arguing that it wasn 't at all funny , instead labelling it " the most vapid , transparent attempt at shock this side of a Lady Gaga performance . " Criticising the acting , he said that Ryder " shouldn 't quit his porn day job any time soon " and that Hoyle 's character was simply a " marriage of wannabe Holden Caulfield @-@ style outsider and mincing paedophile . " 
 Cleaver Patterson was similarly critical in his review on the Cine @-@ Vue website , awarding the film one out of five stars . He questioned the purpose of the film , arguing that it will only serve to alienate the gay population by portraying them as " sad , perverted and ultimately lonely individuals . " More positively , he praised the appearance of the film with its " muted colours of the shingle beaches and piercing blue skies " . 
 = Syracuse University = 
 Syracuse University , commonly referred to as Syracuse , ' Cuse , or SU , is a private research university in Syracuse , New York . The institution 's roots can be traced to the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary ( later becoming Genesee College ) , founded by the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima , New York , in 1831 . After several years of debate over relocating the college to Syracuse , the university was established in 1870 , independent of the college . Since 1920 , the university has identified itself as nonsectarian , although it maintains a relationship with The United Methodist Church . 
 The campus is in the University Hill neighborhood of Syracuse , east and southeast of downtown , on one of the larger hills . Its large campus features an eclectic mix of buildings , ranging from nineteenth @-@ century Romanesque Revival structures to contemporary buildings . SU is organized into 13 schools and colleges , with nationally recognized programs in information studies and library science , architecture , communications , business administration , inclusive education and wellness , sport management , public administration , engineering and the College of Arts and Sciences . 
 Syracuse University athletic teams , known as the Orange , participate in 20 intercollegiate sports . SU is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference for all NCAA Division I athletics , except for the rowing team . SU is also a member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Founding = = = 
 The Genesee Wesleyan Seminary was founded in 1831 by the Genesee Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Lima , New York , south of Rochester . In 1850 , it was resolved to enlarge the institution from a seminary into a college , or to connect a college with the seminary , becoming Genesee College . However , the location was soon thought by many to be insufficiently central . Its difficulties were compounded by the next set of technological changes : the railroad that displaced the Erie Canal as the region 's economic engine bypassed Lima completely . The trustees of the struggling college then decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support . 
 The college began looking for a new home at the same time Syracuse , ninety miles to the east , was engaged in a search to bring a university to the city , having failed to convince Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White to locate Cornell University there rather than in Ithaca . Syracuse resident White pressed that the new university should locate on the hill in Syracuse ( the current location of Syracuse University ) due to the city 's attractive transportation hub , which would ease the recruitment of faculty , students , and other persons of note . However , as a young carpenter working in Syracuse , Cornell had been twice robbed of his wages , and thereafter considered Syracuse a Sodom and Gomorrah insisting the university be in Ithaca on his large farm on East Hill , overlooking the town and Cayuga Lake . 
 Meanwhile , there were several years of dispute between the Methodist ministers , Lima , and contending cities across the state , over proposals to move Genesee College to Syracuse . At the time , the ministers wanted a share of the funds from the Morrill Land Grant Act for Genesee College . They agreed to a quid pro quo donation of $ 25 @,@ 000 from Senator Cornell in exchange for their ( Methodist ) support for his bill . Cornell insisted the bargain be written into the bill and Cornell became New York State 's Land Grant University in 1865 . In 1869 , Genesee College obtained New York State approval to move to Syracuse , but Lima got a court injunction to block the move , and Genesee stayed in Lima until it was dissolved in 1875 . By that time , however , the court injunction had been made moot by the founding of a new university on March 24 , 1870 . On that date the State of New York granted the new Syracuse University its own charter , independent of Genesee College . The City of Syracuse had offered $ 100 @,@ 000 to establish the school . Bishop Jesse Truesdell Peck had donated $ 25 @,@ 000 to the proposed school and was elected the first president of the Board of Trustees . 
 Rev. Daniel Steele , a former Genesee College president , served as the first administrative leader of Syracuse until its Chancellor was appointed . The university opened in September 1871 in rented space downtown . George F. Comstock , a member of the new University 's Board of Trustees , had offered the school 50 acres ( 200 @,@ 000 m2 ) of farmland on a hillside to the southeast of the city center . Comstock intended Syracuse University and the hill to develop as an integrated whole ; a contemporary account described the latter as " a beautiful town ... springing up on the hillside and a community of refined and cultivated membership ... established near the spot which will soon be the center of a great and beneficent educational institution . " 
 The university was founded as coeducational , and President Peck stated at the opening ceremonies , " The conditions of admission shall be equal to all persons ... there shall be no invidious discrimination here against woman .... brains and heart shall have a fair chance ... " Syracuse implemented this policy with a high proportion of women students . In the College of Liberal Arts , the ratio between male and female students during the 19th century was approximately even . The College of Fine Arts was predominantly female , and a low ratio of women enrolled in the College of Medicine and the College of Law . Men and women were taught together in the same courses , and many extra @-@ curricular activities were coeducational as well . Syracuse also developed " women @-@ only " organizations and clubs . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 Coeducation at Syracuse traced its roots to the early days of Genesee College where educators and students like Frances Willard and <unk> Lockwood were heavily influenced by the Women 's movement in nearby Seneca Falls , NY . However , the progressive " co @-@ ed " policies practiced at Genesee would soon find controversy at the new university in Syracuse . Colleges and universities admitted few women students in the 1870s . Administrators and faculty argued women had inferior minds and could not master mathematics and the classics . Dr. Erastus Otis Haven , Syracuse University chancellor and former president of the University of Michigan and Northwestern University , maintained that women should receive the advantages of higher education . He enrolled his daughter , Frances , at Syracuse where she joined the other newly admitted female students in founding the Gamma Phi Beta sorority . The inclusion of women in the early days of the university led to the proliferation of various women 's clubs and societies . In fact , it was a Syracuse professor who coined the term " sorority " specifically for Gamma Phi Beta . 
 In the late 1880s the University engaged in a rapid building spree . Holden Observatory ( 1887 ) was followed by two Romanesque Revival buildings – von Ranke Library ( 1889 ) , now Tolley Administration Building , and Crouse College ( 1889 ) . Together with the Hall of Languages , these first buildings formed the basis for the " Old Row , " a grouping which , along with its companion Lawn , established one of Syracuse 's most enduring images . The emphatically linear organization of these buildings along the brow of the hill follows a tradition of American campus planning which dates to the construction of the " Yale Row " in the 1790s . At Syracuse , the Old Row continued to provide the framework for growth well into the twentieth century . 
 From its founding until through early 1920s , the University grew rapidly . It offered programs in the physical sciences and modern languages , and in 1873 , Syracuse added one of the first architecture programs in the U.S. In 1874 , Syracuse created the nation 's first bachelor of fine arts degree , and in 1876 , the school offered its first post @-@ graduate courses in the College of Arts and Sciences . SU created its first doctoral program in 1911 . SU 's school of journalism , now the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications , was established at Syracuse in 1934 . 
 The growth of Syracuse University from a small liberal arts college into a major comprehensive university were due to the efforts of two men , Chancellor James Day and John Archbold . James Roscoe Day was serving the Calvary Church in New York City where he befriended Archbold . Together , the two dynamic figures would oversee the first of two great periods of campus renewal in Syracuse 's history . 
 John Dustin Archbold was a capitalist , philanthropist , and President of the Board of Trustees at Syracuse University . He was known as John D. Rockefeller 's right @-@ hand man and successor at the Standard Oil Company . He was a close friend of Syracuse University Chancellor James R. Day , and gave almost $ 6 million to the University over his lifetime . Said a journalist in 1917 : 
 Mr. Archbold 's ... is the president of the board of trustees of Syracuse University , an institution which has prospered so remarkably since his connection with it that its student roll has increased from hundreds to over 4 @,@ 000 , including 1 @,@ 500 young women , placing it in the ranks of the foremost institutions of learning in the United States . 
 In addition to keeping the university financially solvent during its early years , he also contributed funds for eight buildings , including the full cost of Archbold Stadium ( opened 1907 , demolished 1978 ) , Sims Hall ( men 's dormitory , 1907 ) , the Archbold Gymnasium ( 1909 , nearly destroyed by fire in 1947 , but still in use ) , and the oval athletic field .

 After World War II , Syracuse University began to transform into a major research institution . Enrollment increased in the four years after the war due to the G.I. Bill , which paid tuition , room , board , and a small allowance for veterans returning from World War II . In 1946 , SU admitted 9 @,@ 464 freshmen , nearly four times greater than the previous incoming class . Branch campuses were established in Endicott , New York and Utica , New York . 
 The velocity with which the university sped through its change into a major research institution was astounding . By the end of the 1950s , Syracuse ranked twelfth nationally in terms of the amount of its sponsored research , and it had over four hundred professors and graduate students engaging in that investigation . 
 From the early 1950s through the 1960s , Syracuse University added programs and staff that continued the transformation of the school into a research university . In 1954 , Arthur Phillips was recruited from MIT and started the first pathogen @-@ free animal research laboratory . The lab focused on studying medical problems using animal models . The School of Social Work , which eventually merged into the College of Human Ecology , was founded in 1956 . Syracuse 's College of Engineering also founded the nation 's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs . In 1962 , Samuel Irving Newhouse , Sr. donated $ 15 million to begin construction of a school of communications , eventually known as the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications . In 1966 , Syracuse University was admitted to the Association of American Universities , an organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education . 
 = = = Pan Am Flight 103 = = = 
 On December 21 , 1988 , 35 Syracuse University students were killed in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland . The students were returning from a study @-@ abroad program in Europe . 
 That evening , Syracuse University went on with a basketball game just hours after the attack , for which it was severely criticized . The conduct of university officials in making the decision was also brought to the attention of the NCAA . The day after the bombing , the university 's chancellor , Melvin A. Eggers , said on nationwide television that he should have cancelled the event . After the attacks on September 11 , 2001 , the NCAA left it up to the conferences to decide what to do about their sports events ; many cancelled them . ( the bombing of Flight 103 was the deadliest terrorist attack against the United States prior to the attacks on September 11 , 2001 . ) 
 In April 1990 , Syracuse University dedicated a memorial wall to the students killed on Flight 103 , constructed at the entrance to the main campus in front of the Hall of Languages . Every year the university holds " Remembrance Week " during the fall semester to commemorate the students . On December 21 a service in the university 's chapel at 2 : 03 p.m. ( 19 : 03 UTC ) marks the exact minute on that date in 1988 when the plane exploded . The University also maintains a link to the tragedy with the " Remembrance Scholars " program , when 35 senior students receive scholarships during their final year at the University . With the " Lockerbie Scholars " program , two graduating students from Lockerbie Academy study at Syracuse for one year .

 The university is set on a campus that features an eclectic mix of buildings , ranging from nineteenth @-@ century Romanesque Revival structures to contemporary buildings designed by renowned architects such as I.M. Pei . The center of campus , with its grass quadrangle , landscaped walkways , and outdoor sculptures , offers students the amenities of a traditional college experience . The university overlooks downtown Syracuse , a medium @-@ sized city ( 140 @,@ 600 residents in 2008 ) . The school also owns a Sheraton Hotel , the Drumlins Country Club — a nearby , 36 @-@ hole golf course , the Fisher Center and Joseph I. Lubin House in New York City , the Paul Greenberg House in Washington , D.C. , and the <unk> Conference Center , a 30 @-@ acre ( 121 @,@ 000 m ² ) retreat in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York .

 Also called " North Campus , " the Main Campus contains nearly all academic buildings and residence halls . Its centerpiece is The Kenneth A. Shaw Quadrangle , more affectionately known as " The Quad " , which is surrounded by academic and administrative buildings . The North Campus represents a large portion of the University Hill neighborhood . Buses run to South Campus , as well as downtown Syracuse and other locations in the city . About 70 percent of students live in University housing . First- and second @-@ year students are required to live on campus . All 22 residence halls are coeducational and each contain a lounge , laundry facility , and various social / study spaces . Residence halls are secured with a card access system . Residence halls are located on both Main Campus and South Campus , the latter of which is a five @-@ minute ride via bus . Learning communities and interest housing options are also available . Food facilities include six residential dining centers , two food courts , and several cafes . 
 The Comstock Tract Buildings , a historic district of older buildings on the campus , was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 . Three buildings on campus — the Crouse Memorial College and the Hall of Languages , and the Pi Chapter House of Psi Upsilon Fraternity — are individually listed on the National Register . 
 A few blocks walk from Main Campus on East Genesee St , the Syracuse Stage building includes two proscenium theatres . The Storch is used primarily by the Drama Department and the Archbold is used primarily by Syracuse Stage , a professional regional theatre .
