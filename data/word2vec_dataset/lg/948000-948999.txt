 = Horses in warfare = 
 The first use of horses in warfare occurred over 5 @,@ 000 years ago . The earliest evidence of horses ridden in warfare dates from Eurasia between 4000 and 3000 BC . A Sumerian illustration of warfare from 2500 BC depicts some type of equine pulling wagons . By 1600 BC , improved harness and chariot designs made chariot warfare common throughout the Ancient Near East , and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350 BC . As formal cavalry tactics replaced the chariot , so did new training methods , and by 360 BC , the Greek cavalry officer Xenophon had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship . The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in technology , including the invention of the saddle , the stirrup , and later , the horse collar . 
 Many different types and sizes of horse were used in war , depending on the form of warfare . The type used varied with whether the horse was being ridden or driven , and whether they were being used for reconnaissance , cavalry charges , raiding , communication , or supply . Throughout history , mules and donkeys as well as horses played a crucial role in providing support to armies in the field . 
 Horses were well suited to the warfare tactics of the nomadic cultures from the steppes of Central Asia . Several East Asian cultures made extensive use of cavalry and chariots . Muslim warriors relied upon light cavalry in their campaigns throughout North Africa , Asia , and Europe beginning in the 7th and 8th centuries AD . Europeans used several types of war horses in the Middle Ages , and the best @-@ known heavy cavalry warrior of the period was the armored knight . With the decline of the knight and rise of gunpowder in warfare , light cavalry again rose to prominence , used in both European warfare and in the conquest of the Americas . Battle cavalry developed to take on a multitude of roles in the late 18th century and early 19th century and was often crucial for victory in the Napoleonic wars . In the Americas , the use of horses and development of mounted warfare tactics were learned by several tribes of indigenous people and in turn , highly mobile horse regiments were critical in the American Civil War . 
 Horse cavalry began to be phased out after World War I in favor of tank warfare , though a few horse cavalry units were still used into World War II , especially as scouts . By the end of World War II , horses were seldom seen in battle , but were still used extensively for the transport of troops and supplies . Today , formal battle ready horse cavalry units have almost disappeared , though the United States Army Special Forces used horses in battle during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan . Horses are still seen in use by organized armed fighters in Third World countries . Many nations still maintain small units of mounted riders for patrol and reconnaissance , and military horse units are also used for ceremonial and educational purposes . Horses are also used for historical reenactment of battles , law enforcement , and in equestrian competitions derived from the riding and training skills once used by the military . 
 = = Types of horse used in warfare = = 
 A fundamental principle of equine conformation is " form to function " . Therefore , the type of horse used for various forms of warfare depended on the work performed , the weight a horse needed to carry or pull , and distance travelled . Weight affects speed and endurance , creating a trade @-@ off : armour added protection , but added weight reduces maximum speed . Therefore , various cultures had different military needs . In some situations , one primary type of horse was favoured over all others . In other places , multiple types were needed ; warriors would travel to battle riding a lighter horse of greater speed and endurance , and then switch to a heavier horse , with greater weight @-@ carrying capacity , when wearing heavy armour in actual combat . 
 The average horse can carry up to approximately 30 % of its body weight . While all horses can pull more than they can carry , the weight horses can pull varies widely , depending on the build of the horse , the type of vehicle , road conditions , and other factors . Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight , but far less if pulling <unk> loads over unpaved terrain . Thus , horses that were driven varied in size and had to make a trade @-@ off between speed and weight , just as did riding animals . Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed . Heavy supply wagons , artillery , and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses . The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered : horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar , and even less with an ox yoke . 
 = = = Light @-@ weight = = = 
 Light , oriental horses such as the ancestors of the modern Arabian , Barb , and Akhal @-@ Teke were used for warfare that required speed , endurance and agility . Such horses ranged from about 12 hands ( 48 inches , 122 cm ) to just under 15 hands ( 60 inches , 152 cm ) , weighing approximately 800 to 1 @,@ 000 pounds ( 360 to 450 kg ) . To move quickly , riders had to use lightweight tack and carry relatively light weapons such as bows , light spears , javelins , or , later , rifles . This was the original horse used for early chariot warfare , raiding , and light cavalry . 
 Relatively light horses were used by many cultures , including the Ancient Egyptians , the Mongols , the Arabs , and the Native Americans . Throughout the Ancient Near East , small , light animals were used to pull chariots designed to carry no more than two passengers , a driver and a warrior . In the European Middle Ages , a lightweight war horse became known as the rouncey . 
 = = = Medium @-@ weight = = = 
 Medium @-@ weight horses developed as early as the Iron Age with the needs of various civilizations to pull heavier loads , such as chariots capable of holding more than two people , and , as light cavalry evolved into heavy cavalry , to carry heavily armored riders . The Scythians were among the earliest cultures to produce taller , heavier horses . Larger horses were also needed to pull supply wagons and , later on , artillery pieces . In Europe , horses were also used to a limited extent to maneuver cannons on the battlefield as part of dedicated horse artillery units . Medium @-@ weight horses had the greatest range in size , from about 14 @.@ 2 hands ( 58 inches , 147 cm ) but stocky , to as much as 16 hands ( 64 inches , 163 cm ) , weighing approximately 1 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 200 pounds ( 450 to 540 kg ) . They generally were quite agile in combat , though they did not have the raw speed or endurance of a lighter horse . By the Middle Ages , larger horses in this class were sometimes called destriers . They may have resembled modern Baroque or heavy warmblood breeds . Later , horses similar to the modern warmblood often carried European cavalry . 
 = = = Heavy @-@ weight = = = 
 Large , heavy horses , weighing from 1 @,@ 500 to 2 @,@ 000 pounds ( 680 to 910 kg ) , the ancestors of today 's draught horses , were used , particularly in Europe , from the Middle Ages onward . They pulled heavy loads , having the power to pull weapons or supply wagons and disposition to remain calm under fire . Some historians believe they may have carried the heaviest @-@ armoured knights of the European Late Middle Ages though others dispute this claim , indicating that the destrier , or knight 's battle horse , was a medium @-@ weight animal . It is also disputed whether the destrier class included draught animals or not . Breeds at the smaller end of the heavyweight category may have included the ancestors of the Percheron , agile for their size and physically able to manoeuvre in battle . 
 = = = Ponies = = = 
 The British Army 's 2nd Dragoons in 1813 had 340 ponies of 14 @.@ 2 hands ( 58 inches , 147 cm ) and 55 ponies of 14 hands ( 56 inches , 142 cm ) ; the Lovat Scouts , formed in 1899 , were mounted on Highland ponies ; the British Army recruited 200 Dales ponies in World War II for use as pack and artillery animals ; and the British Territorial Army experimented with the use of Dartmoor ponies as pack animals in 1935 , finding them to be better than mules for the job . 
 = = = Other equids = = = 
 Horses were not the only equids used to support human warfare . Donkeys have been used as pack animals from antiquity to the present . Mules were also commonly used , especially as pack animals and to pull wagons , but also occasionally for riding . Because mules are often both calmer and hardier than horses , they were particularly useful for strenuous support tasks , such as hauling supplies over difficult terrain . However , under gunfire , they were less cooperative than horses , so were generally not used to haul artillery on battlefields . The size of a mule and work to which it was put depended largely on the breeding of the mare that produced the mule . Mules could be lightweight , medium weight , or even , when produced from draught horse mares , of moderate heavy weight .

 The oldest known manual on training horses for chariot warfare was written c . 1350 BC by the Hittite <unk> , <unk> . An ancient manual on the subject of training riding horses , particularly for the Ancient Greek cavalry is <unk> ( On <unk> ) written about 360 BC by the Greek cavalry officer Xenophon . One of the earliest texts from Asia was that of Kautilya , written about 323 BC . 
 Whether horses were trained to pull chariots , to be ridden as light or heavy cavalry , or to carry the armoured knight , much training was required to overcome the horse 's natural instinct to flee from noise , the smell of blood , and the confusion of combat . They also learned to accept any sudden or unusual movements of humans while using a weapon or avoiding one . Horses used in close combat may have been taught , or at least permitted , to kick , strike , and even bite , thus becoming weapons themselves for the warriors they carried . 
 In most cultures , a war horse used as a riding animal was trained to be controlled with limited use of reins , responding primarily to the rider 's legs and weight . The horse became accustomed to any necessary tack and protective armour placed upon it , and learned to balance under a rider who would also be laden with weapons and armour . Developing the balance and agility of the horse was crucial . The origins of the discipline of dressage came from the need to train horses to be both obedient and manoeuvrable . The Haute <unk> or " High School " movements of classical dressage taught today at the Spanish Riding School have their roots in manoeuvres designed for the battlefield . However , the airs above the ground were unlikely to have been used in actual combat , as most would have exposed the unprotected underbelly of the horse to the weapons of foot soldiers . 
 Horses used for chariot warfare were not only trained for combat conditions , but because many chariots were pulled by a team of two to four horses , they also had to learn to work together with other animals in close quarters under chaotic conditions . 
 = = Technological innovations = = 
 Horses were probably ridden in prehistory before they were driven . However , evidence is scant , mostly simple images of human figures on horse @-@ like animals drawn on rock or clay . The earliest tools used to control horses were bridles of various sorts , which were invented nearly as soon as the horse was domesticated . Evidence of bit wear appears on the teeth of horses excavated at the archaeology sites of the <unk> culture in northern Kazakhstan , dated 3500 – 3000 BC . 
 = = = Harness and vehicles = = = 
 The invention of the wheel was a major technological innovation that gave rise to chariot warfare . At first , equines , both horses and <unk> , were hitched to wheeled carts by means of a yoke around their necks in a manner similar to that of oxen . However , such a design is incompatible with equine anatomy , limiting both the strength and mobility of the animal . By the time of the Hyksos invasions of Egypt , c . 1600 BC , horses were pulling chariots with an improved harness design that made use of a <unk> and <unk> , which allowed a horse to move faster and pull more weight . 
 Even after the chariot had become obsolete as a tool of war , there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies ; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons . The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD ( Southern and Northern Dynasties ) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times . The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century , and became widespread by the 12th century . 
 = = = Riding equipment = = = 
 Two major innovations that revolutionised the effectiveness of mounted warriors in battle were the saddle and the stirrup . Riders quickly learned to pad their horse 's backs to protect themselves from the horse 's spine and withers , and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse 's back and a rudimentary bridle . To help distribute the rider 's weight and protect the horse 's back , some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today 's English saddle . Both the Scythians and Assyrians used pads with added felt attached with a <unk> or girth around the horse 's barrel for increased security and comfort . Xenophon mentioned the use of a padded cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC . 
 The saddle with a solid framework , or " tree " , provided a bearing surface to protect the horse from the weight of the rider , but was not widespread until the 2nd century AD . However , it made a critical difference , as horses could carry more weight when distributed across a solid saddle tree . A solid tree , the predecessor of today 's Western saddle , also allowed a more built @-@ up seat to give the rider greater security in the saddle . The Romans are credited with the invention of the solid @-@ treed saddle . 
 An invention that made cavalry particularly effective was the stirrup . A toe loop that held the big toe was used in India possibly as early as 500 BC , and later a single stirrup was used as a mounting aid . The first set of paired stirrups appeared in China about 322 AD during the Jin Dynasty . Following the invention of paired stirrups , which allowed a rider greater leverage with weapons , as well as both increased stability and mobility while mounted , nomadic groups such as the Mongols adopted this technology and developed a decisive military advantage . By the 7th century , due primarily to invaders from Central Asia , stirrup technology spread from Asia to Europe . The Avar invaders are viewed as primarily responsible for spreading the use of the stirrup into central Europe . However , while stirrups were known in Europe in the 8th century , pictorial and literary references to their use date only from the 9th century . Widespread use in Northern Europe , including England , is credited to the Vikings , who spread the stirrup in the 9th and 10th centuries to those areas .

 The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates from between 4000 and 3000 BC in the steppes of Eurasia , in what today is Ukraine , Hungary , and Romania . Not long after domestication of the horse , people in these locations began to live together in large fortified towns for protection from the threat of horseback @-@ riding raiders , who could attack and escape faster than people of more sedentary cultures could follow . Horse @-@ mounted nomads of the steppe and current day Eastern Europe spread Indo @-@ European Languages as they conquered other tribes and groups . 
 The use of horses in organised warfare was also documented early in recorded history . One of the first depictions of equids is the " war panel " of the Standard of Ur , in Sumer , dated c . 2500 BC , showing horses ( or possibly <unk> or mules ) pulling a four @-@ wheeled wagon . 
 = = = Chariot warfare = = = 
 Among the earliest evidence of chariot use are the burials of horse and chariot remains by the Andronovo ( Sintashta @-@ Petrovka ) culture in modern Russia and Kazakhstan , dated to approximately 2000 BC . The oldest documentary evidence of what was probably chariot warfare in the Ancient Near East is the Old Hittite <unk> text , of the 18th century BC , which mentioned 40 teams of horses at the siege of <unk> . The Hittites became well known throughout the ancient world for their prowess with the chariot . Widespread use of the chariot in warfare across most of Eurasia coincides approximately with the development of the composite bow , known from c . 1600 BC . Further improvements in wheels and axles , as well as innovations in weaponry , soon resulted in chariots being driven in battle by Bronze Age societies from China to Egypt . 
 The Hyksos invaders brought the chariot to Ancient Egypt in the 16th century BC and the Egyptians adopted its use from that time forward . The oldest preserved text related to the handling of war horses in the ancient world is the Hittite manual of <unk> , which dates to about 1350 BC , and describes the conditioning of chariot horses . 
 Chariots existed in the Minoan civilization , as they were inventoried on storage lists from Knossos in Crete , dating to around 1450 BC . Chariots were also used in China as far back as the Shang Dynasty ( c . 1600 – 1050 BC ) , where they appear in burials . The high point of chariot use in China was in the Spring and Autumn Period ( 770 – 476 BC ) , although they continued in use up until the 2nd century BC . 
 Descriptions of the tactical role of chariots in Ancient Greece and Rome are rare . The Iliad , possibly referring to <unk> practices used c . 1250 BC , describes the use of chariots for transporting warriors to and from battle , rather than for actual fighting . Later , Julius Caesar , invading Britain in 55 and 54 BC , noted British charioteers throwing javelins , then leaving their chariots to fight on foot . 
 = = = Cavalry = = = 
 Some of the earliest examples of horses being ridden in warfare were horse @-@ mounted archers or spear @-@ throwers , dating to the reigns of the Assyrian rulers Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III . However , these riders sat far back on their horses , a precarious position for moving quickly , and the horses were held by a handler on the ground , keeping the archer free to use the bow . Thus , these archers were more a type of mounted infantry than true cavalry . The Assyrians developed cavalry in response to invasions by nomadic people from the north , such as the Cimmerians , who entered Asia Minor in the 8th century BC and took over parts of Urartu during the reign of Sargon II , approximately 721 BC . Mounted warriors such as the Scythians also had an influence on the region in the 7th century BC . By the reign of Ashurbanipal in 669 BC , the Assyrians had learned to sit forward on their horses in the classic riding position still seen today and could be said to be true light cavalry . The ancient Greeks used both light horse scouts and heavy cavalry , although not extensively , possibly due to the cost of keeping horses . 
 Heavy cavalry was believed to have been developed by the Ancient Persians , although others argue for the Sarmatians . By the time of Darius ( 558 – 486 BC ) , Persian military tactics required horses and riders that were completely armoured , and selectively bred a heavier , more muscled horse to carry the additional weight . The cataphract was a type of heavily armored cavalry with distinct tactics , armour , and weaponry used from the time of the Persians up until the Middle Ages . 
 In Ancient Greece , Phillip of Macedon is credited with developing tactics allowing massed cavalry charges . The most famous Greek heavy cavalry units were the companion cavalry of Alexander the Great . The Chinese of the 4th century BC during the Warring States period ( 403 – 221 BC ) began to use cavalry against rival states . To fight nomadic raiders from the north and west , the Chinese of the Han Dynasty ( 202 BC – 220 AD ) developed effective mounted units . Cavalry was not used extensively by the Romans during the Roman Republic period , but by the time of the Roman Empire , they made use of heavy cavalry . However , the backbone of the Roman army was the infantry . 
 = = = Horse artillery = = = 
 Once gunpowder was invented , another major use of horses was as draught animals for heavy artillery , or cannon . In addition to field artillery , where horse @-@ drawn guns were attended by gunners on foot , many armies had artillery batteries where each gunner was provided with a mount . Horse artillery units generally used lighter pieces , pulled by six horses . " 9 @-@ pounders " were pulled by eight horses , and heavier artillery pieces needed a team of twelve . With the individual riding horses required for officers , surgeons and other support staff , as well as those pulling the artillery guns and supply wagons , an artillery battery of six guns could require 160 to 200 horses . Horse artillery usually came under the command of cavalry divisions , but in some battles , such as Waterloo , the horse artillery were used as a rapid response force , repulsing attacks and assisting the infantry . Agility was important ; the ideal artillery horse was 15 to 16 hands high , strongly built , but able to move quickly .

 = = = Central Asia = = = 
 Relations between steppe nomads and the settled people in and around Central Asia were often marked by conflict . The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to warfare , and steppe cavalry became some of the most militarily potent forces in the world , only limited by nomads ' frequent lack of internal unity . Periodically , strong leaders would organise several tribes into one force , creating an almost unstoppable power . These unified groups included the Huns , who invaded Europe , and under Attila , conducted campaigns in both eastern France and northern Italy , over 500 miles apart , within two successive campaign seasons . Other unified nomadic forces included the Wu Hu attacks on China , and the Mongol conquest of much of Eurasia . 
 = = = India = = = 
 The literature of ancient India describes numerous horse nomads . Some of the earliest references to the use of horses in South Asian warfare are Puranic texts , which refer to an attempted invasion of India by the joint cavalry forces of the <unk> , Kambojas , Yavanas , <unk> , and <unk> , called the " five hordes " ( <unk> ) or " <unk> " hordes ( <unk> <unk> ) . About 1600 BC , they captured the throne of Ayodhya by dethroning the Vedic king , Bahu . Later texts , such as the Mahābhārata , c . 950 BC , appear to recognise efforts taken to breed war horses and develop trained mounted warriors , stating that the horses of the Sindhu and <unk> regions were of the finest quality , and the Kambojas , <unk> , and Yavanas were expert in fighting from horses . 
 In technological innovation , the early toe loop stirrup is credited to the cultures of India , and may have been in use as early as 500 BC . Not long after , the cultures of Mesopotamia and Ancient Greece clashed with those of central Asia and India . Herodotus ( 484 – 425 BC ) wrote that <unk> mercenaries of the Achaemenid Empire were recruited into the army of emperor Xerxes I of Persia ( 486 – 465 BC ) , which he led against the Greeks . A century later , the " Men of the Mountain Land , " from north of Kabul River , served in the army of Darius III of Persia when he fought against Alexander the Great at Arbela in 331 BC . In battle against Alexander at Massaga in 326 BC , the Assakenoi forces included 20 @,@ 000 cavalry . The Mudra @-@ Rakshasa recounted how cavalry of the <unk> , Yavanas , Kambojas , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> helped Chandragupta Maurya ( c . 320 – 298 BC ) defeat the ruler of Magadha and take the throne , thus laying the foundations of Mauryan Dynasty in Northern India . 
 Mughal cavalry used gunpowder weapons , but were slow to replace the traditional composite bow . Under the impact of European military successes in India , some Indian rulers adopted the European system of massed cavalry charges , although others did not . By the 18th century , Indian armies continued to field cavalry , but mainly of the heavy variety .

 The Chinese used chariots for horse @-@ based warfare until light cavalry forces became common during the Warring States era ( 402 – 221 BC ) . A major proponent of the change to riding horses from chariots was Wu Ling , c . 320 BC . However , conservative forces in China often opposed change , and cavalry never became as dominant as in Europe . Cavalry in China also did not benefit from the additional cachet attached to being the military branch dominated by the nobility . 
 The Japanese samurai fought as cavalry for many centuries . They were particularly skilled in the art of using archery from horseback . The archery skills of mounted samurai were developed by training such as <unk> , which originated in 530 AD and reached its peak under Minamoto Yoritomo ( 1147 – 1199 AD ) in the Kamakura Period . They switched from an emphasis on mounted bowmen to mounted spearmen during the Sengoku period ( 1467 – 1615 AD ) . 
 = = = Middle East = = = 
 During the period when various Islamic empires controlled much of the Middle East as well as parts of West Africa and the Iberian peninsula , Muslim armies consisted mostly of cavalry , made up of fighters from various local groups , mercenaries and Turkoman tribesmen . The latter were considered particularly skilled as both lancers and mounted archers . In the 9th century the use of Mamluks , slaves raised to be soldiers for various Muslim rulers , became increasingly common . Mobile tactics , advanced breeding of horses , and detailed training manuals made Mamluk cavalry a highly efficient fighting force . The use of armies consisting mostly of cavalry continued among the Turkish people who founded the Ottoman Empire . Their need for large mounted forces lead to an establishment of the sipahi , cavalry soldiers who were granted lands in exchange for providing military service in times of war . 
 Mounted Muslim warriors conquered North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula during the 7th and 8th centuries AD following the <unk> , or Hijra , of Muhammad in 622 AD . By 630 AD , their influence expanded across the Middle East and into western North Africa . By 711 AD , the light cavalry of Muslim warriors had reached Spain , and controlled most of the Iberian peninsula by 720 . Their mounts were of various oriental types , including the North African Barb . A few Arabian horses may have come with the <unk> who settled in the Guadalquivir valley . Another strain of horse that came with Islamic invaders was the Turkoman horse . Muslim invaders travelled north from nowadays Spain into France , where they were defeated by the Frankish ruler Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in 732 AD .

 = = = The Middle Ages = = = 
 During the European Middle Ages , there were three primary types of war horses : The destrier , the courser , and the rouncey , which differed in size and usage . A generic word used to describe medieval war horses was charger , which appears interchangeable with the other terms . The medieval war horse was of moderate size , rarely exceeding 15 @.@ 2 hands ( 62 inches , 157 cm ) . Heavy horses were logistically difficult to maintain and less adaptable to varied terrains . The destrier of the early Middle Ages was moderately larger than the courser or rouncey , in part to accommodate heavier armoured knights . However , destriers were not as large as draught horses , averaging between 14 @.@ 2 hands ( 58 inches , 147 cm ) and 15 hands ( 60 inches , 152 cm ) . On the European continent , the need to carry more armour against mounted enemies such as the Lombards and Frisians led to the Franks developing heavier , bigger horses . As the amount of armour and equipment increased in the later Middle Ages , the height of the horses increased ; some late medieval horse skeletons were of horses over 15 hands . 
 Stallions were often used as destriers due to their natural aggression . However , there may have been some use of mares by European warriors , and mares , who were quieter and less likely to call out and betray their position to the enemy , were the preferred war horse of the Moors , who invaded various parts of Southern Europe from 700 AD through the 15th century . Geldings were used in war by the Teutonic Knights , and known as " monk horses " ( German <unk> or <unk> ) . One advantage was if captured by the enemy , they could not be used to improve local bloodstock , thus maintaining the Knights ' superiority in <unk> . 
 = = = = Uses = = = = 
 The heavy cavalry charge , while it could be effective , was not a common occurrence . Battles were rarely fought on land suitable for heavy cavalry . While mounted riders remained effective for initial attacks , by the end of the 14th century , it was common for knights to dismount to fight , while their horses were sent to the rear , kept ready for pursuit . Pitched battles were avoided if possible , with most offensive warfare in the early Middle Ages taking the form of sieges , and in the later Middle Ages as mounted raids called chevauchées , with lightly armed warriors on swift horses . 
 The war horse was also seen in hastiludes — martial war games such as the joust , which began in the 11th century both as sport and to provide training for battle . Specialised destriers were bred for the purpose , although the expense of keeping , training , and outfitting them kept the majority of the population from owning one . While some historians suggest that the tournament had become a theatrical event by the 15th and 16th centuries , others argue that jousting continued to help cavalry train for battle until the Thirty Years ' War . 
 = = = = Transition = = = = 
 The decline of the armoured knight was probably linked to changing structures of armies and various economic factors , and not obsolescence due to new technologies . However , some historians attribute the demise of the knight to the invention of gunpowder , or to the English longbow . Some link the decline to both technologies . Others argue these technologies actually contributed to the development of knights : plate armour was first developed to resist early medieval crossbow bolts , and the full harness worn by the early 15th century developed to resist longbow arrows . From the 14th century on , most plate was made from hardened steel , which resisted early musket ammunition . In addition , stronger designs did not make plate heavier ; a full harness of musket @-@ proof plate from the 17th century weighed 70 pounds ( 32 kg ) , significantly less than 16th century tournament armour . 
 The move to predominately infantry @-@ based battles from 1300 to 1550 was linked to both improved infantry tactics and changes in weaponry . By the 16th century , the concept of a combined @-@ arms professional army had spread throughout Europe . Professional armies emphasized training , and were paid via contracts , a change from the ransom and pillaging which reimbursed knights in the past . When coupled with the rising costs involved in outfitting and maintaining armour and horses , the traditional knightly classes began to abandon their profession . Light horses , or prickers , were still used for scouting and reconnaissance ; they also provided a defensive screen for marching armies . Large teams of draught horses or oxen pulled the heavy early cannon . Other horses pulled wagons and carried supplies for the armies . 
 = = = Early modern period = = = 
 During the early modern period the shift continued from heavy cavalry and the armoured knight to unarmoured light cavalry , including Hussars and Chasseurs à cheval . Light cavalry facilitated better communication , using fast , agile horses to move quickly across battlefields . The ratio of footmen to horsemen also increased over the period as infantry weapons improved and footmen became more mobile and versatile , particularly once the musket bayonet replaced the more cumbersome pike . During the Elizabethan era , mounted units included cuirassiers , heavily armoured and equipped with lances ; light cavalry , who wore mail and bore light lances and pistols ; and " <unk> " , who carried an early carbine . As heavy cavalry use declined armour was increasingly abandoned and dragoons , whose horses were rarely used in combat , became more common : mounted infantry provided reconnaissance , escort and security . However , many generals still used the heavy mounted charge , from the late 17th century and early 18th century , where sword @-@ wielding wedge @-@ formation shock troops penetrated enemy lines , to the early 19th century , where armoured heavy cuirassiers were employed . 
 Light cavalry continued to play a major role , particularly after the Seven Years ' War when Hussars started to play a larger part in battles . Though some leaders preferred tall horses for their mounted troops this was as much for prestige as for increased shock ability and many troops used more typical horses , averaging 15 hands . Cavalry tactics altered with fewer mounted charges , more reliance on drilled manoeuvres at the trot , and use of firearms once within range . Ever @-@ more elaborate movements , such as wheeling and <unk> , were developed to facilitate the use of firearms from horseback . These tactics were not greatly successful in battle since pikemen protected by musketeers could deny cavalry room to manoeuvre . However the advanced equestrianism required survives into the modern world as dressage . While restricted , cavalry was not rendered obsolete . As infantry formations developed in tactics and skills , artillery became essential to break formations ; in turn , cavalry was required to both combat enemy artillery , which was susceptible to cavalry while deploying , and to charge enemy infantry formations broken by artillery fire . Thus , successful warfare depended in a balance of the three arms : cavalry , artillery and infantry . 
 As regimental structures developed many units selected horses of uniform type and some , such as the Royal Scots Greys , even specified colour . <unk> often rode distinctive horses so they stood out . Regional armies developed type preferences , such as British hunters , Hanoverians in central Europe , and steppe ponies of the Cossacks , but once in the field , the lack of supplies typical of wartime meant that horses of all types were used . Since horses were such a vital component of most armies in early modern Europe , many instituted state stud farms to breed horses for the military . However , in wartime , supply rarely matched the demand , resulting in some cavalry troops fighting on foot . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 In the 19th century distinctions between heavy and light cavalry became less significant ; by the end of the Peninsular War , heavy cavalry were performing the scouting and outpost duties previously undertaken by light cavalry , and by the end of the 19th century the roles had effectively merged . Most armies at the time preferred cavalry horses to stand 15 @.@ 2 hands ( 62 inches , 157 cm ) and weigh 990 to 1 @,@ 100 pounds ( 450 to 500 kg ) , although cuirassiers frequently had heavier horses . Lighter horses were used for scouting and raiding . Cavalry horses were generally obtained at 5 years of age and were in service from 10 or 12 years , barring loss . However losses of 30 – 40 % were common during a campaign due to conditions of the march as well as enemy action . Mares and geldings were preferred over less @-@ easily managed stallions . 
 During the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars the cavalry 's main offensive role was as shock troops . In defence cavalry were used to attack and harass the enemy 's infantry flanks as they advanced . Cavalry were frequently used prior to an infantry assault , to force an infantry line to break and reform into formations vulnerable to infantry or artillery . Infantry frequently followed behind in order to secure any ground won or the cavalry could be used to break up enemy lines following a successful infantry action . 
 Mounted charges were carefully managed . A charge 's maximum speed was 20 km / h ; moving faster resulted in a break in formation and fatigued horses . Charges occurred across clear rising ground , and were effective against infantry both on the march and when deployed in a line or column . A foot battalion formed in line was vulnerable to cavalry , and could be broken or destroyed by a well @-@ formed charge . Traditional cavalry functions altered by the end of the 19th century . Many cavalry units transferred in title and role to " mounted rifles " : troops trained to fight on foot , but retaining mounts for rapid deployment , as well as for patrols , scouting , communications , and defensive screening . These troops differed from mounted infantry , who used horses for transport but did not perform the old cavalry roles of reconnaissance and support . 
 = = Sub @-@ Saharan Africa = = 
 Horses were used for warfare in the central Sudan since the 9th century , where they were considered " the most precious commodity following the slave . " The first conclusive evidence of horses playing a major role in the warfare of West Africa dates to the 11th century when the region was controlled by the Almoravids , a Muslim Berber dynasty . During the 13th and 14th centuries , cavalry became an important factor in the area . This coincided with the introduction of larger breeds of horse and the widespread adoption of saddles and stirrups . Increased mobility played a part in the formation of new power centers , such as the Oyo Empire in what today is Nigeria . The authority of many African Islamic states such as the <unk> Empire also rested in large part on their ability to subject neighboring peoples with cavalry . Despite harsh climate conditions , endemic diseases such as trypanosomiasis the African horse sickness and unsuitable terrain that limited the effectiveness of horses in many parts of Africa , horses were continuously imported and were , in some areas , a vital instrument of war . The introduction of horses also intensified existing conflicts , such as those between the <unk> and Nama people in Namibia during the 19th century . 
 The African slave trade was closely tied to the imports of war horses , and as the prevalence of slaving decreased , fewer horses were needed for raiding . This significantly decreased the amount of mounted warfare seen in West Africa . By the time of the Scramble for Africa and the introduction of modern firearms in the 1880s , the use of horses in African warfare had lost most of its effectiveness . Nonetheless , in South Africa during the Second Boer War ( 1899 – 1902 ) , cavalry and other mounted troops were the major combat force for the British , since the horse @-@ mounted Boers moved too quickly for infantry to engage . The Boers presented a mobile and innovative approach to warfare , drawing on strategies that had first appeared in the American Civil War . The terrain was not well @-@ suited to the British horses , resulting in the loss of over 300 @,@ 000 animals . As the campaign wore on , losses were replaced by more durable African Basuto ponies , and Waler horses from Australia . 
 = = The Americas = = 
 The horse had been extinct in the Western Hemisphere for approximately 10 @,@ 000 years prior to the arrival of Spanish Conquistadors in the early 16th century . Consequently , the Indigenous peoples of the Americas had no warfare technologies that could overcome the considerable advantage provided by European horses and gunpowder weapons . In particular this resulted in the conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires . The speed and increased impact of cavalry contributed to a number of early victories by European fighters in open terrain , though their success was limited in more mountainous regions . The Incas ' well @-@ maintained roads in the Andes enabled quick mounted raids , such as those undertaken by the Spanish while resisting the siege of Cuzco in 1536 – 7 . 
 Indigenous populations of South America soon learned to use horses . In Chile , the Mapuche began using cavalry in the <unk> War in 1586 . They drove the Spanish out of Araucanía at the beginning of the 17th century . Later , the Mapuche conducted mounted raids known as <unk> , first on Spanish , then on Chilean and Argentine settlements until well into the 19th century . In North America , Native Americans also quickly learned to use horses . In particular , the people of the Great Plains , such as the Comanche and the Cheyenne , became renowned horseback fighters . By the 19th century , they presented a formidable force against the United States Army . 
 During the American Revolutionary War ( 1775 – 1783 ) , the Continental Army made relatively little use of cavalry , primarily relying on infantry and a few dragoon regiments . The United States Congress eventually authorized regiments specifically designated as cavalry in 1855 . The newly formed American cavalry adopted tactics based on experiences fighting over vast distances during the Mexican War ( 1846 – 1848 ) and against indigenous peoples on the western frontier , abandoning some European traditions . 
 During the American Civil War ( 1861 – 1865 ) , cavalry held the most important and respected role it would ever hold in the American military . Field artillery in the American Civil War was also highly mobile . Both horses and mules pulled the guns , though only horses were used on the battlefield . At the beginning of the war , most of the experienced cavalry officers were from the South and thus joined the Confederacy , leading to the Confederate Army 's initial battlefield superiority . The tide turned at the 1863 Battle of Brandy Station , part of the Gettysburg campaign , where the Union cavalry , in the largest cavalry battle ever fought on the North American continent , ended the dominance of the South . By 1865 , Union cavalry were decisive in achieving victory . So important were horses to individual soldiers that the surrender terms at Appomattox allowed every Confederate cavalryman to take his horse home with him . This was because , unlike their Union counterparts , Confederate cavalrymen provided their own horses for service instead of drawing them from the government .

 Although cavalry was used extensively throughout the world during the 19th century , horses became less important to warfare after the beginning of the 20th century . Light cavalry was still seen on the battlefield at the beginning of the 20th century , but formal mounted cavalry began to be phased out for combat during and immediately after World War I , although units that included horses still had military uses well into World War II . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 World War I saw great changes in the use of cavalry . The mode of warfare changed , and the use of trench warfare , barbed wire and machine guns rendered traditional cavalry almost obsolete . Tanks , introduced in 1917 , began to take over the role of shock combat . 
 Early in the War , cavalry skirmishes were common , and horse @-@ mounted troops widely used for reconnaissance . On the Western Front cavalry were an effective flanking force during the " Race to the Sea " in 1914 , but were less useful once trench warfare was established . There a few examples of successful shock combat , and cavalry divisions also provided important mobile firepower . Cavalry played a greater role on the Eastern Front , where trench warfare was less common . On the Eastern Front , and also against the Ottomans , the " cavalry was literally indispensable . " British Empire cavalry proved adaptable , since they were trained to fight both on foot and while mounted , while other European cavalry relied primarily on shock action . 
 On both fronts , the horse was also used as a pack animal . Because railway lines could not withstand artillery bombardments , horses carried ammunition and supplies between the railheads and the rear trenches , though the horses generally were not used in the actual trench zone . This role of horses was critical , and thus horse fodder was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries . Following the war , many cavalry regiments were converted to mechanised , armoured divisions , with light tanks developed to perform many of the cavalry 's original roles . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 Several nations used horse units during World War II . The Polish army used cavalry to defend against the armies of Nazi Germany during the 1939 invasion . Both the Germans and the Soviet Union maintained cavalry units throughout the war , particularly on the Eastern Front . The British Army used horses early in the war , and the final British cavalry charge was on March 21 , 1942 , when the Burma Frontier Force encountered Japanese infantry in central Burma . The only American cavalry unit during World War II was the 26th Cavalry . They challenged the Japanese invaders of Luzon , holding off armoured and infantry regiments during the invasion of the Philippines , repelled a unit of tanks in <unk> , and successfully held ground for the Allied armies ' retreat to Bataan . 
 Throughout the war , horses and mules were an essential form of transport , especially by the British in the rough terrain of Italy and the Middle East . The United States Army utilised a few cavalry and supply units during the war , but there were concerns that the Americans did not use horses often enough . In the campaigns in North Africa , generals such as George S. Patton lamented their lack , saying , " had we possessed an American cavalry division with pack artillery in Tunisia and in Sicily , not a German would have escaped . " 
 The German and the Soviet armies used horses until the end of the war for transportation of troops and supplies . The German Army , strapped for motorised transport because its factories were needed to produce tanks and aircraft , used around 2 @.@ 75 million horses — more than it had used in World War I. One German infantry division in Normandy in 1944 had 5 @,@ 000 horses . The Soviets used 3 @.@ 5 million horses . 
 = = Recognition = = 
 While many statues and memorials have been erected to human heroes of war , often shown with horses , a few have also been created specifically to honor horses or animals in general . One example is the Horse Memorial in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa . Both horses and mules are honored in the Animals in War Memorial in London 's Hyde Park . 
 Horses have also at times received medals for extraordinary deeds . After the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War , a surviving horse named Drummer Boy , ridden by an officer of the 8th Hussars , was given an unofficial campaign medal by his rider that was identical to those awarded to British troops who served in the Crimea , engraved with the horse 's name and an inscription of his service . A more formal award was the PDSA Dickin Medal , an animals ' equivalent of the Victoria Cross , awarded by the People 's Dispensary for Sick Animals charity in the United Kingdom to three horses that served in World War II . 
 = = Modern uses = = 
 Today , many of the historical military uses of the horse have evolved into peacetime applications , including exhibitions , historical reenactments , work of peace officers , and competitive events . Formal combat units of mounted cavalry are mostly a thing of the past , with horseback units within the modern military used for reconnaissance , ceremonial , or crowd control purposes . With the rise of mechanised technology , horses in formal national militias were displaced by tanks and armored fighting vehicles , sometimes still referred to as " cavalry " .

 Organised armed fighters on horseback are occasionally seen . The best @-@ known current examples are the Janjaweed , militia groups seen in the Darfur region of Sudan , who became notorious for their attacks upon unarmed civilian populations in the Darfur conflict .

 At the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom , Operational Detachment Alpha 595 teams were covertly inserted into Afghanistan on October 19 , 2001 . Horses were the only suitable transportation for the difficult mountainous terrain of Northern Afghanistan . They were the first U.S. soldiers to ride horses into battle since January 16 , 1942 , when the U.S. Army ’ s 26th Cavalry Regiment charged an advanced guard of the 14th Japanese Army as it advanced from Manila .

In rural areas , horses are used by law enforcement for mounted patrols over rugged terrain , crowd control at religious shrines , and border patrol . 
 In rural areas , law enforcement that operates outside of incorporated cities may also have mounted units . These include specially deputised , paid or volunteer mounted search and rescue units sent into roadless areas on horseback to locate missing people . Law enforcement in protected areas may use horses in places where mechanised transport is difficult or prohibited . Horses can be an essential part of an overall team effort as they can move faster on the ground than a human on foot , can transport heavy equipment , and provide a more rested rescue worker when a subject is found . 
 = = = Ceremonial and educational uses = = = 
 Many countries throughout the world maintain traditionally trained and historically uniformed cavalry units for ceremonial , exhibition , or educational purposes . One example is the Horse Cavalry Detachment of the U.S. Army 's 1st Cavalry Division . This unit of active duty soldiers approximates the weapons , tools , equipment and techniques used by the United States Cavalry in the 1880s . It is seen at change of command ceremonies and other public appearances . A similar detachment is the Governor General 's Horse Guards , Canada 's Household Cavalry regiment , the last remaining mounted cavalry unit in the Canadian Forces . Nepal 's King 's Household Cavalry is a ceremonial unit with over 100 horses and is the remainder of the Nepalese cavalry that existed since the 19th century . An important ceremonial use is in military funerals , which often have a caparisoned horse as part of the procession , " to symbolize that the warrior will never ride again " . 
 Horses are also used in many historical reenactments . <unk> try to recreate the conditions of the battle or tournament with equipment that is as authentic as possible . 
 = = = Equestrian sport = = = 
 Modern @-@ day Olympic equestrian events are rooted in cavalry skills and classical horsemanship . The first equestrian events at the Olympics were introduced in 1912 , and through 1948 , competition was restricted to active @-@ duty officers on military horses . Only after 1952 , as mechanisation of warfare reduced the number of military riders , were civilian riders allowed to compete . Dressage traces its origins to Xenophon and his works on cavalry training methods , developing further during the Renaissance in response to a need for different tactics in battles where firearms were used . The three @-@ phase competition known as Eventing developed out of cavalry officers ' needs for versatile , well @-@ schooled horses . Though show jumping developed largely from fox hunting , the cavalry considered jumping to be good training for their horses , and leaders in the development of modern riding techniques over fences , such as Federico <unk> , came from military ranks . Beyond the Olympic disciplines are other events with military roots . Competitions with weapons , such as mounted shooting and tent pegging , test the combat skills of mounted riders . 
 = Stonyhurst College = 
 Stonyhurst College is a coeducational Roman Catholic independent school , adhering to the Jesuit tradition , on the Stonyhurst Estate , Lancashire , England . It occupies a Grade I listed building . The school has been fully co @-@ educational since 1999 . 
 The college was founded in 1593 by Father Robert Persons SJ at St Omer , at a time when penal laws prohibited Catholic education in England . After moving to Bruges in 1762 and Liège in 1773 , the college moved to Stonyhurst in 1794 . It provides boarding and day education to approximately 450 boys and girls aged 13 – 18 . On an adjacent site , its preparatory school , St Mary 's Hall , provides education for boys and girls aged 3 – 13 . 
 The school combines an academic curriculum with extra @-@ curricular pursuits . Roman Catholicism plays a central role in college life , with emphasis on both prayer and service , according to the Jesuit philosophy . 
 The school 's alumni include three Saints , twelve Beati , seven archbishops , seven Victoria Cross winners , a Peruvian president , a Bolivian president , a New Zealand prime minister , a signatory of the American Declaration of Independence and several writers , sportsmen , and politicians .

 = = = Stonyhurst Hall = = = 
 The earliest deed concerning the " <unk> " is held in the college 's Arundell Library ; it dates from approximately 1200 . In 1372 , a licence was granted to John de Bayley for an oratory on the site . His descendants , the Shireburn family , completed the oldest portion of the extant buildings . Richard Shireburn began building the hall , which was enlarged by his grandson Nicholas who also constructed the ponds , avenue and gardens . Following his death , the estate passed to his wife and then to their sole heir , Mary , the Duchess of Norfolk . In 1754 , it was inherited by her cousin Thomas Weld of Lulworth . A former pupil of the school from its years in Liège , he donated the buildings , with 30 acres ( 120 @,@ 000 m2 ) of land , in 1794 to the Society of Jesus . 
 = = = The college = = = 
 The story of the school starts at St Omer in what was then the Spanish Netherlands in 1593 , where a college , under the Royal Patronage of Philip II of Spain , was founded by Fr Robert Persons SJ for English boys unable to receive a Catholic education in Elizabethan England . As such it was one of several expatriate English schools operating on the European mainland . In 1762 , the Jesuits were forced to flee and re @-@ established their school at Bruges . The school was moved in 1773 to Liège , where it operated for two decades before moving to Stonyhurst on 29 August 1794 . Schooling resumed on 22 October that year . 
 The college flourished during the 19th century : the Society of Jesus was re @-@ established in Britain at Stonyhurst in 1803 , and over the century , student numbers rose from the original twelve migrants from Liège . By the turn of the following century , it had become England 's largest Catholic college . Stonyhurst Hall underwent extensive alterations and additions to accommodate these numbers ; the Old South Front was constructed in 1810 , only to be demolished and replaced with much grander buildings in the 1880s . A seminary was constructed on the estate , and an observatory and meteorological station erected in the gardens . The 20th century saw the gradual hiring of a mostly lay staff , as the number of Jesuits declined . The seminary at St Mary 's Hall was closed , and the school discontinued its education of university @-@ aged philosophers . With the closure of Beaumont College in 1967 and the transfer away from the Society of Jesus of Mount St Mary 's College , <unk> , Derbyshire , in 2006 , Stonyhurst became the sole Jesuit public school in England . 
 Since the Second World War , the buildings have been refurbished or developed . Additions include new science buildings in the 1950s and 1960s , a new boarding wing in the 1960s , a new swimming pool in the 1980s and Weld House in 2010 . The school became fully co @-@ educational in 1999 . 
 = = Hodder Place , St Mary 's Hall and Hodder House = = 
 The original preparatory school to Stonyhurst , Hodder Place , came into the hands of the Jesuits as part of the estate donated by alumnus Thomas Weld . Originally used as a novitiate , it became a preparatory school to the college in 1807 . 
 St Mary 's Hall , on an adjoining site to Stonyhurst , was built as a Jesuit seminary in 1828 ( extended in the 1850s ) and functioned until 1926 , when the seminarians moved to Heythrop Hall . The poet Gerard Manley Hopkins , and John Tolkien , son of J. R. R. Tolkien , trained as priests there . During World War II , the English College left Benito Mussolini 's Italy and occupied the hall . After their return to Rome , St Mary 's Hall opened as a middle school in 1946 . At the same time , Hodder Place continued to educate those aged eight to eleven , until its closure and conversion into flats in 1970 . Hodder Place pupils moved up to St Mary 's Hall to form Hodder Playroom . As successor to Hodder Place , St Mary 's Hall has a claim to being the oldest surviving preparatory school in Britain . 
 In 2004 , the old gymnasium at St Mary 's Hall was converted into new nursery and infant facilities named Hodder House , for those aged three to seven . 
 = = Religious life = = 
 The college is Catholic and has had a significant place in English Catholic history for many centuries ( including controversial events such as the Popish Plot and Gunpowder Plot conspiracies ) . It was founded initially to educate English Catholics on the continent in the hope that , through them , Catholicism might be restored in England . 
 Finally , the school settled in England in 1794 and the Society of Jesus was officially re @-@ established in Britain in 1803 . Stonyhurst remained the headquarters of the English Province until the middle of the century ; by 1851 , a third of the Province 's Jesuits were based there . Until the 1920s , Jesuit priests were trained on site in what is today the preparatory school . There was a drop in vocations after World War I and the seminary was closed . The number of Jesuits teaching at Stonyhurst fell to a third of the staff within a decade . Since then , the Jesuit presence has been in decline , but the school continues to place Catholicism and Jesuit philosophy at its core under the guidance of a Jesuit @-@ led chaplaincy team and the involvement of the Jesuits in its governance . 
 = = = Jesuit ethos = = = 
 The Jesuit educational ethos consists chiefly of seven strands : 
 Finding God in All Things ; 
 Caring for the individual ; 
 Showing love in deeds ; 
 Building Christian community ; 
 Engaging with the wider world ; 
 Encouraging excellence ; and 
 Co @-@ operating in Jesuit mission . 
 Under these guiding principles , the college strives for the formation of well @-@ rounded individuals , influenced by Ignatian reasoning and spirituality , and concern for humankind : the development of " Men and Women for Others " . 
 = = = Chapels = = = 
 The school has one main church , St Peter 's , and five chapels : the Boys ' Chapel , the Chapel of the Angels , the Sodality Chapel , the St Francis Chapel and the St Ignatius Chapel . The last two are both within the towers of St Peter 's Church , and are not normally used by pupils . The Sodality Chapel is the home of the relics of the 3rd @-@ century Roman convert St <unk> . The Jesuits brought his remains from the College of St Omer and held them beneath the altar since 1859 . His bones were temporarily removed in 2006 whilst the chapel underwent restoration , but they have since been returned . The chapel is again used by the re @-@ established Sodality . Adjacent to the Old Infirmary is the Rosary Garden , a place for spiritual contemplation , at the centre of which is a stone statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary . 
 St Peter 's Church underwent extensive repair and refurbishment in 2010 – 11 . Most of the Victorian stencilling was not restored , although the whitewash was removed from the stencilling above the altar . 
 = = = Traditions = = = 
 It is a long @-@ standing practice , as with many Jesuit schools around the world , that pupils write <unk> in the top left hand corner of any piece of work they do . It stands for the Latin phrase Ad <unk> Dei <unk> which means For the Greater Glory of God . At the end of a piece of work they write <unk> in the centre of the page . It stands for Laus Deo Semper which means Praise to God Always . These are both traditional Jesuit mottoes . 
 = = Charitable status = = 
 As a registered charity , Stonyhurst is obliged to provide benefits to the wider community under the terms of the Charities Act 2006 . As such , the College is home to the local Catholic parish church , which receives worshippers from Hurst Green on a daily basis . Its sports facilities , including the swimming pool and all @-@ weather pitch are available for public use ; the latter was used for competitors training for the London 2012 Olympic Games . Much of the estate has public access ; in particular the gardens and tea house are visited during the summer months , whilst the college plays host to tours , antiques fairs , food festivals , music concerts , conferences and weddings . The school has relationships with several state schools , arranging shared activities with their pupils , in particular those serving special needs children . In addition , the school makes available some places to pupils offered on scholarship , bursaries or free of charge ; almost a third of current pupils receive financial support for their places . 
 = = Motto = = 
 The French motto Quant Je <unk> ( As Much as I Can ) is central to the ethos of the school , which focuses upon the all @-@ round development of the individual . It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original mansion on the site ; the family emblem is emblazoned , in stone , with the motto , above the fireplace in the Top Refectory . At the far end of the same room , once the dining room of the <unk> , the motto can be seen again , carved into the minstrel 's gallery : Quant Je <unk> . Hugo Sherburn <unk> me <unk> fecit . Anno Domini 1523 . Et <unk> fuit sic fiat . 
 = = Academic = = 
 Academic standards are high : 93 % of GCSE students attain A * -C grades ; there is a 100 % pass rate at A @-@ Level ; and 100 % of A @-@ Level leavers take up places at universities ( 10 % to Oxbridge ) or on gap year schemes . The school 's most recent inspection rated much of the education and pastoral provision as ' outstanding ' . 
 Ten GCSEs are usually taken by each pupil , consisting of five compulsory subjects ( Religious Studies , Mathematics , English Language and Literature , and a modern language ( French , German or Spanish ) plus Information Technology and Personal , Social Education , with five other options from humanities , sciences , or arts subjects . In Poetry ( lower sixth ) , four or five AS @-@ Levels are taken from a choice of 25 subjects , with a weekly Theology class . One of these may be dropped and the remainder , or all , taken on to A @-@ Level . Six A * – C grades are the requirement for Sixth Form entry . Each academic department has dedicated teaching rooms around the school , in addition to the general classrooms and playroom study places . 
 Education during the college 's early history was based on St Ignatius ' Ratio <unk> , with emphasis upon theology , classics and science , all of which still feature prominently in the curriculum . The educational practice , observed at the College of St Omer , of dividing a class into Romans and Carthaginians continued long after the migration to Stonyhurst but is not employed today ; each pupil would be pitched against an opponent with the task of picking up on the other 's mistakes in an attempt to score points . 
 Until Roman Catholics were admitted to Oxbridge in 1854 , Stonyhurst was also home to " philosopher gentlemen " studying BA courses under the London Matriculation Examination system . Their numbers began to fall after 1894 and the department was closed in 1916 . 
 = = Libraries and collections = = 
 = = = Libraries = = = 
 Stonyhurst College has four main libraries : the Arundell , the Bay , the Square and the More ( dedicated to Saint Thomas More ) . 
 The More Library is the main library for students whilst the ' House Libraries ' ( the Arundell , the Bay , and the Square ) contain many artefacts from the Society of Jesus and English Catholicism . The Arundell Library , presented in 1837 by Everard , 11th Baron Arundell of Wardour , is the most significant ; it is not only a country @-@ house library from Wardour Castle but also has a notable collection of 250 incunabula , medieval manuscripts and volumes of Jacobite interest , signal among which is Mary Tudor 's Book of Hours , which it is believed was given by Mary , Queen of Scots to her chaplain on the scaffold . The manuscript Le Livre de <unk> Medicines was written in 1354 by Henry , Duke of Lancaster . To these were added the archives of the English Province of the Society of Jesus , which include 16th @-@ century manuscript verses by St Robert Southwell SJ , the letters of St Edmund Campion SJ ( 1540 – 81 ) and <unk> of the 19th @-@ century poet Gerard Manley Hopkins . The Arundell Library has a copy of the Chronicles of Jean Froissart , captured at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 , and held the 7th @-@ century Stonyhurst Gospel of St John before it was loaned to the British Library , as well as a First Folio of Shakespeare . 
 = = = Collections = = = 
 Among those collections kept away from public view are the numerous blood @-@ soaked garments from Jesuits martyred in Japan , the skull of Cardinal Morton , the ropes used to quarter St Edmund Campion SJ , the hairs of St Francis Xavier SJ , an enormous solid silver jewel @-@ encrusted monstrance , the Wintour vestments , a cope made for Henry VII , and a thorn said to be from the crown of thorns placed upon Jesus ' head at the crucifixion . 
 The school owns paintings , including a portrait of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia and another of the Jesuit Henry Garnet . In the Stuart Parlour are portraits of Jacobites including James Francis Edward Stuart , and his sons Charles Edward Stuart and Henry Benedict Stuart . There are also several original engravings by Rembrandt and Dürer , such as the ' Greater Passion ' and the ' Car of Maximillian ' . 
 = = Observatory = = 
 The school has a functioning observatory which was built in 1866 . An older observatory , built in 1838 , is now the <unk> Collegii , but was once one of seven important stations in the country when the Meteorological Office came under the auspices of the Royal Society . The records of temperature taken there start from 1846 and are the oldest continuous daily records in the world . During the nineteenth century , the observatory was maintained by the astronomer priests , Fr Weld , Fr Perry and Fr <unk> whose research included astronomy , <unk> and seismology . Astrophysicist Pietro Angelo Secchi , director of the Vatican Observatory , also taught astronomy at the College during the period . Sir Edward Sabine chose the observatory as one of his main stations when conducting a magnetic survey of Britain in 1858 . Five years later Fr <unk> began the first series of monthly geometric observations , which continued until May 1919 . During the course of the twentieth century , the observatory fell out of use and its telescope , parts of which dated to the 1860s , was sold after the Second World War . When its private owner came to sell it , the college was able to buy it back and restore it to its original home . The observatory is today used for astronomical purposes again , whilst also functioning as one of four weather stations used by the Met Office to provide central England temperature data ( CET ) . 
 = = Arts = = 
 = = = Music , drama and art = = = 
 Music plays a prominent rôle in school life . All those entering the school in Lower Grammar ( year nine ) are obliged to learn to play an orchestral instrument . There are two choirs : the Chapel Choir , which sings regularly at mass , and the Schola Cantorum , composed of teachers and pupils , which sings at concerts and public events such as the May celebration in the college amphitheatre . Pupils participate in the school orchestra and various bands , whilst the staff band is a feature of the Poetry Banquet and Rhetoric Ball . 
 Drama is equally important , with plays staged throughout the school year , the main performance being at Great Academies , whilst some students take Theatre Studies as an additional AS Level subject . The college has a traditional theatre , the Academy Room , and a high @-@ tech theatre built at St Mary 's Hall as part of the <unk> Appeal in 1993 . The latter plays host to the annual Ribble Valley International Piano Week . Several former pupils have gone on to achieve success upon the stage , including OSCAR @-@ winning actor and director Charles Laughton and BAFTA @-@ winning director and producer Peter Glenville . 
 Art is an important part of the curriculum , and is compulsory for those in Lower Grammar ( year nine ) . There is a dedicated art studio in addition to a separate design and technology centre . Student artwork is displayed on the walls of the Lower Gallery , including a portrait of the Queen painted by Isobel Bidwell during the Golden Jubilee year ; upon receipt of a copy , the Queen 's lady @-@ in @-@ waiting said that " The Queen was delighted to see the painting and know that it is on display in the school " . 
 = = = Literary associations = = = 
 Stonyhurst has provided inspiration for poets and authors who include former classics teacher Gerard Manley Hopkins , whose poems feature details of the local countryside , and former pupil Sir Arthur Conan Doyle whose " Baskerville Hall " was modelled on Stonyhurst Hall , and who named Sherlock Holmes ' nemesis , Moriarty , after a fellow pupil . J. R. R. Tolkien wrote part of The Lord of the Rings in a classroom on the Upper Gallery during his stay at the college where his son taught Classics ; his " Middle @-@ earth " is said to resemble the local area , whilst there are specific resonances in names such as " Shire Lane " , ( the name of a road in Hurst Green ) and the " River <unk> " ( the <unk> built Stonyhurst ) . Poet Laureate Alfred Austin , and the poet Oliver St John Gogarty ( " Stately plump Buck Mulligan " in James Joyce 's Ulysses ) were educated at the school , ( as were the sons of Oscar Wilde and Evelyn Waugh ) . George Archer @-@ <unk> , at the centre of Terence Rattigan 's play The Winslow Boy , is an alumnus . 
 The school runs its own publication company , St Omer 's Press , which publishes religious literature , and first began when the college was located at St Omer in Flanders . 
 = = Sport = = 
 Pupils are required to participate in games on a regular basis . The school plays rugby union and other sporting activities are on offer , and since turning fully co @-@ educational , hockey and rounders have widened the sports programme . 
 = = = Stonyhurst College Rugby Union Football Club ( <unk> ) = = = 
 Rugby has played a big part in the life of the school , despite only supplanting football as the school 's primary sport in 1921 . All boys are encouraged to play when they enter Lower Grammar but are not required to play throughout their time at the school . Stonyhurst has a successful rugby season , with games well supported by pupils , staff and parents . Sporting rivalry is particularly prominent against fellow Catholic independent schools Ampleforth College and Mount St Mary 's College and Sedbergh School in Cumbria . The Stonyhurst Sevens take place annually , attracting large crowds and teams from all over the country . 
 The school has produced sixteen international rugby players ( England ( 5 ) , Ireland ( 6 ) , Scotland ( 1 ) Italy ( 1 ) , the USA ( 1 ) Bermuda ( 1 ) and the Bahamas ( 1 ) ) , as well as players for the Barbarians and the British and Irish Lions . Most recently they include Iain Balshaw and <unk> Bracken , who both played for England when they won the 2003 Rugby World Cup , whilst another member of that team , Will Greenwood , went to Stonyhurst Saint Mary 's Hall , where his mother taught maths until 2007 . Current pupils of the school have won places to represent Spain , the Irish Exiles and the Welsh Exiles ( under 19s ) . Old boys have also played at varsity level and have won blues for Oxford or Cambridge . 
 Stonyhurst has had well @-@ known coaches , including former England coaches Ben Sanders , Dick Greenwood and Brian Ashton who coached the first XV . 
 Many pupils have represented Stonyhurst in the England Schools U16 and U18 Rugby teams . These include Daniel Mckenzie and Andy Fuller who both received an U18 England cap in 2000 . 
 = = = Stonyhurst Football = = = 
 Stonyhurst Football , inherited from the College of St Omer ( along with Stonyhurst Cricket ) , was played between the handball walls on the Playground . The game was discontinued with the advent of association football but was re @-@ established in 1988 when a " Grand Match " was played at Great Academies ; traditionally a " Grand Match " was played on Shrove Tuesday and was the primary Stonyhurst Football match of the season . The teams were England vs France ( although during the Crimean War England vs Russia was played and more recently England vs Ireland was played in the 1980s ) . The last game took place in 1995 .

 Those in Grammar Playroom ( year ten ) are automatically enrolled in the CCF and are given the option of continuing at the end of the year , following a summer camp which takes place at a local barracks . Training involves a range of activities such as drill ( marching and related manoeuvres ) , shooting , learning how to assemble and clean weapons , tactical planning and team work . The school supplies pupils with uniform , the orderliness of which is rigorously enforced and inspected each week . Each platoon is led by a Junior Under Officer , his sergeant and corporals who are sixth form students .

 In recent years , some pupils have gone on to receive places at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst . This follows a long tradition of service from Stonyhurst pupils : many Old Stonyhurst ( O.S. ) were killed in the two World Wars and are commemorated on the war memorial at the end of the Upper Gallery . 
 The Stonyhurst War Records were published in their honour . A memorial at the top of the main staircase records the names of the six O.S. killed in the Boer War .

 = = = Playroom system = = = 
 Unlike most English public schools , Stonyhurst is organised horizontally by year groups ( known as playrooms ) rather than vertically by houses , although the girls are also split into junior and senior houses . Each playroom has an assigned playroom master , with each cohort moving through the playrooms , having a sequence of playroom masters ( rather than a single housemaster ) . 
 The college has the following playrooms , following the Roman order of learning : 
 Lower Grammar Playroom ( ' LG ' 13 – 14 ) 
 Grammar Playroom ( 14 – 15 ) 
 Syntax Playroom ( 15 – 16 , GCSE Year ) 
 Poetry Playroom ( 16 – 17 ) 
 Rhetoric Playroom ( 17 – 18 ) 
 During the school 's history the following playrooms or years have also existed :

 St Omers ( Yellow , though Brown for sporting attire ) ( named after St Omer , the town the school was founded in ) 
 Shireburn ( Green ) ( named after the Shireburn family which built Stonyhurst )

 = = Notable events in the school year = = 
 The <unk> <unk> , inherited from the College of St Omer , in its present form , is the opening address of the headmaster at the beginning of the year to the entire school gathered in the Academy Room . Previously , it was a formal transition for pupils from one playroom to the next at the beginning of the year , which involved a pupil from each year announcing to the playroom of the year below them that the next playroom had been vacated by the senior pupils . The students and their belongings would then move up to their next playroom . 
 " Great Academies " takes place annually at the end of the first half of the summer term . Although different in its present form , it is a continuation of a tradition begun at St Omers , with the first taking place at Stonyhurst on 6 August 1795 . Today , it is an occasion when the school is on display – there are exhibitions , musical performances , the school play , sporting events , as well as prize @-@ giving and the headmaster 's speech , culminating with the Rhetoric Ball and Rhetoric Mass the following morning . 
 = = Stonyhurst Association = = 
 After less formal arrangements had been made for many years , the Association was formed in 1879 . Its primary objective is to foster a strong spirit of union amongst past pupils and friends of Stonyhurst , which has been achieved in a variety of ways reflecting the spirit of succeeding generations . Recently , there has been a strong charitable emphasis , embedded with similar developments at the College . This was formalised in 1985 , when the Association was granted charitable status by the Charity Commission . It also supports charities connected to the school including Eagle Aid .

 Hoodwinked ! ( alternatively styled Hoodwinked ) is a 2005 American computer @-@ animated family comedy film . It retells the folktale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation , using flashbacks to show multiple characters ' points of view . It was produced independently by Blue Yonder Films with Kanbar Entertainment , directed and written by Cory Edwards , Todd Edwards , and Tony Leech , and produced by Katie Hooten , Maurice Kanbar , David K. Lovegren , Sue Bea Montgomery , and Preston Stutzman . The film was released by The Weinstein Company in Los Angeles , California , on December 16 , 2005 for a one @-@ week engagement before expanding nationwide on January 13 , 2006 . The cast features Anne Hathaway , Glenn Close , Jim Belushi , Patrick Warburton , Anthony Anderson , David Ogden Stiers , Xzibit , Chazz Palminteri and Andy Dick . 
 Hoodwinked ! was among the earliest computer @-@ animated films to be completely independently funded . Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control , but also restrained them economically . Due to the film 's small budget , its animation was produced in the Philippines , with a less realistic design inspired by stop motion films . The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film 's distributor until near the end of production , and while the company had many roles recast , it otherwise made few changes to the film . 
 Structurally , the film was inspired by non @-@ linear crime dramas , such as Rashomon and Pulp Fiction . It was released shortly after the first two installments in the successful Shrek series , which accentuated the fairy tale parody genre of which it is a part . The film however , intentionally deviated from that series in its style of humor and in certain plot elements . This was in part based on Cory Edwards ' concerns over exposing children to the high level of cynicism often found in the genre . 
 Critical reception to the film was varied ; although its script and cast were praised by many reviews , its animation quality was heavily criticized . The film was a commercial success , earning over thirteen times its budget . A sequel , Hoodwinked Too ! Hood vs. Evil , directed by Mike Disa , and written by the Edwards brothers and Leech , was released in 2011 to negative reviews and financial failure . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Little Red Riding Hood discovers that the Big Bad Wolf has disguised himself as Granny . Red 's grandma jumps out of the closet tied up just as the axe @-@ wielding woodsman bursts through the window , startling everyone . The police quickly arrive , and Red , Wolf , Granny , and the Woodsman are questioned by Detective Nicky Flippers about the events leading up to the incident . 
 Red explains that she was delivering goodies for her grandmother when she discovered a threat from the mysterious Goodie Bandit . Hoping to save her Granny 's recipes , she embarked upon a journey to take them to the top of a nearby mountain where her Granny lives . On her way , she encountered the Wolf , who asked her a series of suspicious questions . She managed to escape and eventually reached her Granny 's house ; however , she found the Wolf already waiting in ambush . 
 What at first seems to be an open @-@ and @-@ shut case becomes confused though , once it is learned that the Wolf is an investigative reporter . He reveals that he was searching for a lead on the identity of the Goody Bandit and had reason to believe that Red and Granny were the culprits . Locating Red , he questioned her , hoping to get to the bottom of the mystery . When Red escaped , he headed for her Granny 's house and arriving first , went undercover , hoping to trick her into giving him the evidence he needed . 
 When questioned , the Woodsman reveals that he is in fact an aspiring actor who was only trying out for the part of a woodsman in a commercial . After his schnitzel truck was robbed by the Goody Bandit , he went out into the woods to get in character for his role and spent the rest of the day chopping trees . A large tree rolled after him and pushed him through the window of Granny 's home . The investigation then turns to Granny , who reveals that , unbeknownst to her family , she is an extreme sports enthusiast . During a ski race earlier that day , she was attacked by the opposing team , but got away safely after learning that they were hired by the Goody Bandit . 
 Despondent over her Granny 's lack of honesty , Red wanders off alone . Meanwhile , Nicky Flippers realizes that the one commonality between all four stories was a bunny named Boingo and concludes that he is the Goody Bandit . However , Boingo has already sneaked into the home and stolen Granny 's recipes . Red sees Boingo and follows him to his hideout at a cable car station , but the police pursue him in the wrong direction . Granny , the Wolf , and the Woodsman manage to locate Boingo as he is explaining his evil scheme to Red . Boingo plans to add an addictive substance to the stolen recipes and then explode the forest , making way for new real estate for expanding his business . 
 The Wolf and the Woodsman go undercover to distract Boingo as Granny sneaks into his lair , but open conflict ensues . Boingo sends a bound and gagged Red down the mountain in a cable car loaded with explosives and Granny goes after her , with Boingo and his henchmen in pursuit . Red manages to free herself , and escapes with Granny , while the police , who have been located by the Wolf 's assistant Twitchy , are waiting at the bottom of the mountain to arrest Boingo and his henchmen . Some time later , the Woodsman finds success as part of a yodeling troupe , and Red , Granny , the Wolf , and Twitchy are enlisted by Nicky Flippers to join a crime solving organization called Happily Ever After Agency .

 Hoodwinked ! was one of the first independent computer @-@ animated films to be produced without the aid of a distributor . It was produced on a budget of less than $ 8 million , significantly less than a typical computer @-@ animated film 's budget . The costs of computer @-@ animation software had only recently decreased to a price that was accessible to more than just major studios , and according to producer David Lovegren , " Six or seven years ago , the idea of doing Hoodwinked ! as an independent [ animated ] feature would have been impossible . " 
 The filmmakers only made the film independently by necessity , and Cory Edwards has said , " It ’ s not a model to be followed . It was a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime , seat @-@ of @-@ your pants kind of thing that just barely came off . " However , he added that the process was worth going through to get the film made , and encouraged aspiring filmmakers to be willing to follow it . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Brothers Cory and Todd Edwards founded Blue Yonder Films after a number of years spent producing commercials and music videos in Tulsa . Joined by their friend Preston Stutzman , who was put in charge of marketing for the company , they released their first feature film , Chillicothe , at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival . The three then moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of new opportunities , but did not find the amount of success that they had expected . Sue Bea Montgomery , who had served as an associate producer on Chillicothe , also tried to interest studios in working with them , but was met with indifference . She determined that they would have to find greater success in independent filmmaking before anyone would take interest in them and introduced the three to Maurice Kanbar , a successful entrepreneur who had made a minor investment in Chillicothe . They pitched a number of live @-@ action ideas to Kanbar and proposed that he invest in a development division of their company , paying them and covering their rent in exchange for a significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell . Kanbar however , was interested in a more direct approach , and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film . He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct @-@ to @-@ DVD computer @-@ animated short film that Cory had made called <unk> . He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist , and gave them a month to come up with a story idea . Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio , but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by Walt Disney . A few days after the brothers ' initial meeting with Kanbar , Todd found inspiration in non @-@ linear crime dramas , such as Rashomon , Pulp Fiction , Run Lola Run , and Memento and came up with the idea of telling the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation , using multiple points of view . Kanbar was taken with the idea and agreed to fully finance the film before even seeing a finished script , with the initial intent of releasing the film directly to DVD . In 2002 , Kanbar and Montgomery founded Kanbar Entertainment and Kanbar Animation for the production of the film . 
 Cory served as the film 's main director , as he had more experience with animation , comedy , and children 's entertainment , while Todd served as co @-@ director . Montgomery and Stutzman were joined by Disney animation veteran David Lovegren as producers on the film , and Cory 's and Todd 's sister Katie Hooten joined as an associate producer . Tony Leech , who had worked with the Edwards brothers on Chillicothe , was initially hired as an editor , but gained story input as well . He eventually proved to be so valuable to the production that he was given a role as co @-@ director .

 The filmmakers found independently producing the film to have both benefits and challenges . Although they were given a great amount of creative control by their executive producer Maurice Kanbar , their small budget kept them from making potentially beneficial changes to the story once production was underway . Todd Edwards related that " Money doesn ’ t just buy you more talent and more machinery , it also buys you flexibility on a story level . At Disney , if they don ’ t like the third act , they just throw the whole thing out and re @-@ animate the whole thing , even if it ’ s finished ... We had no such luxury , and so in a way , you ’ re watching our first version of the movie . " Knowing ahead of time their inability to alter the film 's script once animating had begun , an effort was made by the filmmakers to finalize the script as much as possible before the start of production , which is not a common practice for studio @-@ produced animated films . 
 Turning away from the well @-@ known archetypes of the Little Red Riding Hood characters , the filmmakers continued to look towards non @-@ linear crime dramas for inspiration instead . Producer Preston Stutzman explained that " The whole film is about surprises and secret lives . " Not wanting Red to be " boring " or " too innocent " , she was patterned on James Dean and given the desire of leaving home to find her way in the world . Todd Edwards had the idea of basing the Wolf on Chevy Chase 's character in Fletch , feeling that it would be fun to apply the character ’ s dry , deadpan style of humor to an animated wolf , while Cory Edwards created the hyperactive character of Twitchy to serve as the Wolf ’ s foil . Going against types , Red ’ s Granny was written as a thrill @-@ seeking action hero , while the strong Woodsman was written as being childishly incompetent . 
 The police officers were written to come across as everyday guys and Cory Edwards has explained that the decision to make three of them pigs was not politically motivated . Nicky Flippers was not a part of the story as it was initially conceived and prior to his creation , the investigation was going to be led by Chief Grizzly . After producer Sue Bea Montgomery and her husband pointed out similarities between the film and the 1950s television series The Thin Man , the Edwards brothers and Leech decided to introduce the character and his dog into the film as an homage . They considered several different types of animals before settling on making him a frog . 
 Cory Edwards chose to approach the film predominately as an action / comedy , instead of as a typical animated film , and wrote the script to appeal to audiences of any age like many of the films produced by Pixar or Disney . Road Runner , Rocky and Bullwinkle , and The Muppets have all been cited as inspirations for the film . An attempt was made to distance the film from Shrek and other similar themed films that had been recently released , by excluding magic , wizards , and fairies from the film . Cory Edwards also strived for a different style of humor than Shrek , choosing to make his film more family friendly and less of a satire . 
 Working out of Tony Leech 's apartment , Cory Edwards sketched the film 's storyboards , Todd Edwards wrote the script while simultaneously writing the songs , and Leech edited the story reel on his Mac computer . Producer Sue Bea Montgomery showed test screenings of the story reel to children in her neighborhood , and gained input from their reactions . The filmmakers had been considering removing Japeth , but chose not to when he proved popular at these screenings . The children also particularly liked Twitchy , which led to the expansion of the character 's role . 
 In an effort to save costs , the film 's cast was originally going to be composed mostly of friends and family members of the filmmakers . Cory and Todd brought in their cousin Tye Edwards to play Dolph and turned to their friend Joshua J. Greene to play Jimmy Lizard . Japeth was written specifically for Benjy Gaither , the son of gospel music singers Bill and Gloria Gaither . He had been a friend of the Edwards brothers since childhood and Cory 's short film <unk> had been produced through his animation studio Live Bait Productions . Cory 's wife Vicki was given the role of a skunk reporter , and while some consideration was initially given to having an adult play the child woodpecker Quill , the role was instead given to producer David K. Lovegren 's daughter Kathryn . The Edwards brothers , Leech , and producer Preston Stutzman all took on roles as well . Cory took on the role of Twitchy , and Pro Tools was used to speed up the recording of his dialogue by 50 percent . Todd played Sandwich Man , Leech played both Det . Bill Stork and Glen , and Stutzman played Timmy . 
 As the producers gained greater confidence in the film however , larger name actors were brought in . Patrick Warburton was the first celebrity actor to join the film and did so purely out of a love for the script . Though Cory Edwards had originally envisioned the Wolf as sounding like a mixture between a young Chevy Chase and Bill Murray , he praised Warburton 's performance , saying that he " made the Wolf his own character . " Andy Dick also joined the cast early on , to voice Boingo . He used improvisation and approached the role differently from how it had been written , interpreting the character as victimized and unstable . The filmmakers were enthusiastic over Dick ’ s angle on the character , and Todd Edwards said , " What we had written was kind of stock , to be honest , but Andy Dick , well , where he was supposed to laugh , he ’ d be crying . Where he was supposed to yell , he ’ d be laughing . He just mixed it up ! " Prolific voice performers Tara Strong , David Ogden Stiers , and Tom Kenny were cast in multiple roles . Strong was cast as Red and Zorra , Stiers was cast as Kirk , the Woodsman and Nicky Flippers , and Kenny was cast as Tommy and Woolworth the Sheep . Emmy @-@ winning actress Sally Struthers was brought in to play Granny Puckett and Joel McCrary was cast as Chief Grizzly . 
 = = = Animation = = = 
 The film 's animation was created on Maya software , and in an effort to save costs , was produced in Manila , Philippines . Producers Sue Bea Montgomery and David K. Lovegren founded the animation studio Digital <unk> for the purpose of the film 's production and stationed it in a 5 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot rented house . Cory Edwards traveled to this studio a total of fifteen times over the course of the film 's three @-@ year production and has explained that although the house was located in an expensive part of Manila , the rent was no more than that of his two @-@ bedroom apartment in Los Angeles . When Cory was not able to be on site , Todd took over directing duties . " Along with Tony , we were kind of a ' three headed monster , ' " Cory explains . " We all knew what movie we were making , and I trusted those guys to make creative calls when I couldn 't be there . " Lovegren had attempted to start an independent animation studio in the Philippines before in 2001 , but the studio , called <unk> , was closed after it failed to attract business . Digital <unk> hired approximately twenty animators that had previously been employed by <unk> and at one point , the studio reached fifty employees . 
 The film 's animators had little experience with computer @-@ animation and feature @-@ length films , and had to be trained by the producers over the course of the film 's production . Since none of the animators were specialists , they were not divided into specific teams , but instead each worked on all areas of the animating process . The filmmakers found this to be a poor method though , because it kept the individual skills of the animators from being optimized . Due to their independent backgrounds , the animators were accustomed to working at fast paces , and despite their small numbers , each phase of production was able to be completed within a short period of time . Still , schedule and budget restraints led the filmmakers to enlist Prana Studios in Mumbai , India to perform lighting and compositing . 
 The filmmakers found that the most difficult aspect of producing the film independently was their inability to fix all of the mistakes made in the film 's animation . Todd Edwards explained that " it becomes an equation : ' I have 10 things that I would like to change in this shot . I have the time and the budget to do three . Pick those three and then let 's move on . ' And that was hard to do . " 
 Knowing that they could not match the quality of other computer @-@ animated films , the film was instead designed to imitate the look of stop motion . Cory Edwards cited Rankin @-@ Bass as an inspiration and explained , " If we approach our look like that — photographed miniatures in stop @-@ motion — and if that nostalgia resonates with our audience as far as that look , then we ’ re not going to shoot ourselves in the foot trying to put every freckle and hair on <unk> creatures . " Edwards contrasted the technically innovative , but critically panned 1986 film Howard the Duck with the simple , but beloved puppet character Kermit the Frog to illustrate to his crew the importance of well @-@ written , likeable characters over technical quality . 
 Distancing the film from what producer Preston Stutzman called the " candy @-@ coated , brightly colored pastel world [ s ] " of other CG animated films , an attempt was made to bring an organic look to the film , and dirt was rubbed into the colors . The Nightmare Before Christmas was cited as an inspiration for the filmmakers to try to bend the characters ' shapes into extremes , and many other choices unconventional to computer @-@ animated films were also made . For example , one of the Woodsman 's eyes was made bigger than the other , and Red was given only four fingers , so as to make her look more like a doll . Producer Katie Hooten explained that " CG in the past has been pushing the envelope to make things look more realistic , but Hoodwinked takes things back to where CG looks a lot more like a cartoon . " 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The film 's score was composed by John Mark Painter , who along with his wife Fleming McWilliams , constituted the rock duo Fleming and John in the 1990s . The Edwards brothers were fans of the group and first met Painter while Cory was performing in an animated film on which Painter served as the composer . The score was inspired by music from the 1960s and the soundtracks to Planet of the Apes , Dark Shadows , and The Untouchables have been cited as influences , as well as the works of Henry Mancini . It was recorded in Nashville , Tennessee , where Kristin Wilkinson served as the orchestrator and conductor . 
 In an effort to appeal to older audience members , Todd Edwards chose to replace parts of Painter 's score with original rock music . From this came the song " Little Boat " , written and sung by Daniel Rogers , who had composed Edwards ' first film Chillicothe . " Runaway " was written by Joshua J. Greene , a friend of the Edwards brothers , who also provided the voice of Jimmy Lizard in the film . " The Real G " , sung by Cory Edwards and " Bounce " , sung by Todd Collins were both written by Painter and Cory Edwards . " Blow Your House Down " was performed by the Filipino band Pupil and written by their lead singer Ely Buendia . 
 Todd Edwards wrote nine original songs for the film and sung four of them : " Critters Have Feelings " , " Tree Critter " , " Eva Deanna " , and " Glow " . " Eva Deanna " was written about a day that he and his wife spent at the zoo with their niece , the daughter of associate producer Katie Hooten . " Great Big World " was sung by Anne Hathaway and replaced another song called " Woods Go @-@ Round " , which Edwards considered too childish and described as being " in the vein of Saturday morning cartoons . " This change required the scene to be re @-@ animated and re @-@ cut . " Be Prepared " was sung by Benjy Gaither and developed out of a practicality ; the filmmakers wanted to introduce Japeth while the character is rocking back and forth on his horns , as though the horns are a rocking chair . However , they realized that this would make the horns too big to fit in a <unk> later on in the film . As a solution , they came up with the gag of having the character switch his horns several times , and this led to the song 's concept . McWilliams joined Jim Belushi to sing " The Schnitzel Song " and Painter asked his longtime friend Ben Folds to sing " Red is Blue " , a selection strongly advocated for by Edwards . Folds was working on a new album at the time , but a year after the proposal , found the opportunity to record the song and compose a piano arrangement for it as well . " Top of the Woods " was sung by Andy Dick and was originally composed to be slow paced . The recording of Dick 's performance was sped up though at the suggestion of Ralf Palmer , a prolific animator and friend of producer Sue Bea Montgomery . 
 = = = Distribution = = = 
 Hoodwinked ! was shown to potential distributors throughout various stages of its production . Though a distribution offer was made by DreamWorks , it was turned down as the filmmakers did not feel that it was a good deal . As the film neared the end of production , it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival . Harvey and Bob Weinstein were also at the festival at the time , screening Robert Rodriguez 's film Sin City , which they were distributing through their then newly formed studio , The Weinstein Company . They decided to pick Hoodwinked ! up for distribution after it was brought to their attention by Rodriguez 's wife , whose attorney also happened to work for Blue Yonder Films . The Weinsteins had recently left the Walt Disney Company and according to Cory Edwards , they " loved the idea of picking up an animated film and giving Disney a run for their money . " The involvement of the Weinstein Company encouraged Kanbar enough to enlist Skywalker Sound . The film was nearly complete by the time that the Weinsteins became involved , and Edwards has stated that nothing was done by them to ruin " the original vision of the movie . " However , a few edit suggestions were made to quicken the film 's pace which Edwards felt were good ideas , as he considered the first twenty minutes to be dragging . 
 The Weinstein Company also heavily recast the film with bigger @-@ name actors in the hopes of attracting a larger audience . Anne Hathaway replaced Tara Strong in the lead role of Red ; Jim Belushi replaced David Ogden Stiers in the role of Kirk , the Woodsman ; Anthony Anderson replaced Tony Leech in the role of Det . Bill Stork ; Glenn Close replaced Sally Struthers in the role of Granny Puckett ; Xzibit replaced Joel McCrary in the role of Chief Grizzly ; and Chazz Palminteri replaced Tom Kenny in the role of Woolworth the Sheep . Despite these recastings , Tara Strong retained the much @-@ smaller role of Zorra , David Ogden Stiers retained the role of Nicky Flippers , Tom Kenny retained the role of Tommy , and Tony Leech retained the role of Glen . Many high @-@ profile country singers were considered to replace Benjy Gaither in the role of Japeth , but none of them were available and Gaither retained the role . The Weinsteins also wanted to replace Joshua J. Greene in the role of Jimmy Lizard with a more famous actor such as Albert Brooks , but the role was ultimately not recast . Edwards appreciated the reason for the recastings and attributed a large part of the film 's financial success to them . He expressed disappointment about the amount of recasting however , saying , " At a certain point it became <unk> @-@ o @-@ Rama , everybody got recast @-@ happy . My feeling is , you get two or three names on that poster , you 're fine . Our Hoodwinked poster has like a paragraph of names on it . After a certain point , I don 't think you need more than two , three celebrities – give it to the voice actors . It sweetens the pot . " Since the film 's animation had already been mostly completed by the time the recastings were made , the new actors had to deliver their lines exactly as the old actors had done , giving them no opportunity to improvise . Edwards expressed disappointment with the fact that the original actors would not get any credit for their improvisations in the film , which were copied by the replacement actors .

 Hoodwinked ! received mixed reviews from critics . On Rotten Tomatoes , the film has a rating of 47 % , based on 123 reviews . The site 's consensus reads , " This fractured fairytale doesn 't have the wit or animation quality to compete with the likes of the Shrek franchise . " On Metacritic , it received a score of 45 out of 100 , based on 29 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . 
 James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two and a half stars out of four , and claimed that many of the film 's ideas for altering its familiar storyline " sound better on paper than they turn out in execution . " Finding it tedious to view the film 's story told multiple times , he wrote that the film " slips into boredom . " Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle also gave the film two and a half stars , and although he praised its " snappy dialogue and fresh characterizations " , he considered the film ’ s plot underdeveloped and characters lacking in motivation . Peter Rainer writing for The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a C + and called it " a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn 't quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children . " He was not overly critical of the film , but felt that it was a disappointment in comparison to the high standards for computer @-@ animated films set by Pixar . Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News suggested that timelessness is a necessary component of an animated classic , and faulted the film for its attempt to be hip and current . While Ty Burr of The Boston Globe praised the film ’ s vocal performances , he wrote , " Hoodwinked never builds to a level of sustained comic mania ... One aches to think what the great Looney Tunes directors could have done with this material . " 
 Several critics however , were more enthusiastic about the film . Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave Hoodwinked ! an A- and praised the zaniness of its humor . Calling the filmmakers heroes , he compared them to Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh due to their potential for bringing independent filmmaking to prominence in animation . Although Nancy Churnin of the Dallas Morning News considered the film inferior to those of Pixar and DreamWorks , she still gave it a B and wrote , " it 's got an upstart charm , a clever premise , appealing characters voiced by a terrific cast and a script that should make you laugh out loud more than once . " In his review for the Chicago Tribune , Michael Wilmington praised the film 's voice cast , music , and script , and wrote , " it packs more verbal wit and surprise than the usual cartoon . " Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times gave it three and a half stars out of five calling it " high @-@ energy , imaginative entertainment " . 
 Japeth was praised amongst both positive and negative reviews . Gleiberman and Churnin both felt that the character was one of the best parts of the film , and Westbrook and Wilmington both described him as " a hoot " . In a mostly positive review for the Orlando Sentinel , Roger Moore called the character hilarious , while in a mostly negative review for Variety , Justin Chang wrote that the character " steals the show every minute he 's onscreen . " 
 One of the main criticisms of the film was the poor quality of its animation . Berardinelli called it some of the worst CGI animation in memory . He felt that the characters looked plastic , considered the backgrounds dull , and wrote , " On more than one occasion , I thought I was watching something made for TV . When compared to today 's visual standards for animated films , Hoodwinked is far below the curve . " Burr considered the film 's surfaces poorly rendered and compared them to " <unk> reupholstered with <unk> . " Westbrook felt that the animation worked well for the animal characters , but wrote , " the humans have a glassy sheen and brittle hardness , much like work done in the early days of CG ... That art has come too far to embrace a throwback like Hoodwinked as lovably quaint . It 's simply dated . " Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post compared the characters to rubber toys , and wrote , " their faces are without nuance or vividness ... In movement , especially , do they lack grace and conviction . It seems like the recent breakthroughs in computerized magic have bypassed the poor Edwards fellows , as it looks stuck somewhere in the 1970s , or maybe even earlier . " 
 Many reviews negatively compared the film to the Shrek series . Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail considered the film to be " a sort of discount Shrek " , while Burr called it " Shrek with added <unk> . " Westbrook wrote that " Echoing such a popular predecessor as Shrek is not a good thing — especially when the echo is so faint . " Berardinelli felt that the fairy tale references were not as smartly done as in the first Shrek film , while Bernard felt that Hoodwinked ! took fairy tale revisionism too far . He felt that the humor in Shrek worked due to the fairy tale characters remaining in character throughout the film , and wrote , " It 's pointless to scold them for behaving the way fairy tales intended , and that 's far funnier than turning them into breakdancing anachronisms . " Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic , considered Red 's kung fu abilities to be overly similar to Princess Fiona 's " Matrix agility . " Gleiberman also noted the similarities between the film and Shrek , but he was positive in the comparison , feeling that its independent production gave the filmmakers " the freedom to follow their <unk> corkscrew whims . " While Wilmington did not find Hoodwinked ! as impressive or beguiling as Shrek , he wrote that " when it 's cooking , it does make you laugh . " 
 Retrospectively , several critics noted that the film was considerably better than the 2007 computer @-@ animated fairy tale parody film Happily N 'Ever After . Although Burr had given Hoodwinked ! a negative review , he likened the film to Citizen Kane in comparison to Happily N 'Ever After . Wilmington also considered Hoodwinked ! the superior of the two films , and Lou Lumenick of the New York Post felt that the film was far wittier than Happily N 'Ever After . While Christy Lemire of Associated Press likened Hoodwinked ! to a poor man 's Shrek , she went on to call Happily N 'Ever After a poor man 's Hoodwinked ! 
 Hoodwinked ! received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Animated Film at the Academy of Science Fiction , Fantasy & Horror Films , but lost to Corpse Bride . Entertainment Weekly ranked the film as number ten on " The Must List " for its January 27 , 2006 issue , calling it a " genre @-@ busting indie animated gem . "

 In February 2006 , author Timothy Sexton wrote an article titled " Hoodwinked : A Postmodern Examination of the Dangers of Runaway Capitalism " for Associated Content , in which he posited that Hoodwinked ! was one of the first postmodern animated films and also carried political undertones . He argued that the relative nature of truth was shown by revealing deviations from the original fairy tale as the film explored the story from each of the central characters ' points of view . Calling Hoodwinked ! " the most subversive movie released nationwide since Fahrenheit 9 / 11 " , Sexton went on to interpret the film as a critique on the free enterprise system . He drew comparisons between the film 's villain and the typical American business owner , going so far as to say that the character was " clearly based on people like Bill Gates and Sam Walton " . In Sexton 's view , the film exposed the flaws of capitalism , showing that if left unregulated , business owners will establish monopolies and eliminate competition . 
 The film 's director and co @-@ writer Cory Edwards was surprised by Sexton 's interpretation and denied that the film intentionally carried any political messages . He explained that he and the other filmmakers were simply drawing from the evil schemes common of James Bond films , Bugs Bunny cartoons , and The A @-@ Team , and wrote " If Mr. Sexton sees my movie as a sermon against mega @-@ corporations monopolizing America , that ’ s fine . But our villain is just as easily the face of every dictator in history , or every schoolyard bully who is compensating for low self @-@ esteem , or any Mafia boss who dominates by either absorbing or wiping out his competition . Hey , if you look at an abstract painting and see the devil in a red splotch , that ’ s your prerogative ... I guess a movie ’ s message is only partially supplied by the filmmaker . " 
 In May 2007 Time magazine ran an article by James Poniewozik titled " Is Shrek Bad for Kids ? " which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires , instead of the original stories . Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked ! writing , " I thought Hoodwinked ! and most of the Shrek series were hilarious ... But even if you ultimately reject their messages , old @-@ school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary . There 's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre @-@ satirized , the skepticism , critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood . " Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine , expressing his similar sentiments and writing , " As the writer @-@ director of Hoodwinked , it may surprise you that I couldn ’ t agree more with James Poniewozik ’ s article . Even as I was making the film , I asked myself the same question : Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first , ' un @-@ parodied ? ' We went to great lengths to distance our film from Shrek ’ s humor ( and no , I don ’ t think Shrek considers kids ) . I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters , rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence . We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales , whether we admit it or not . "

 A sequel , Hoodwinked Too ! Hood vs. Evil , was released on April 29 , 2011 . It was first announced in January 2006 and in February , Cory Edwards , Todd Edwards , and Tony Leech explained that although they would be writing the screenplay , they would not return to direct . Cory Edwards later elaborated on this decision , explaining that he had a negative experience working with some of the first film 's " key players " and felt that he had been poorly treated by them . He also cited concerns over being confined to animation , and stated that he felt it would be a lateral move to direct a sequel to his first film as his second film . In March 2007 , Edwards announced that Mike Disa had been hired to direct the sequel and expressed enthusiasm over his involvement , saying that he " has a real passion for the film and a devotion to maintaining the Hoodwinked world . He wants to do the sequel justice and he really gets what we ’ re trying to do . " Although much of the first film 's cast returned for the sequel , Anne Hathaway was replaced by Hayden Panettiere in the role of Red and Jim Belushi was replaced by Martin Short in the role of Kirk , the Woodsman . 
 Kanbar Entertainment initially intended to finance production of the sequel independently as it had done with the first film , but entered into a co @-@ financing agreement proposed by The Weinstein Company . The film was initially scheduled to be released on January 15 , 2010 , but in December 2009 , The Weinstein Company postponed the film 's release date indefinitely . In April 2010 , Kanbar Entertainment brought a lawsuit against The Weinstein Company . In addition to claiming that the postponement of the film 's release date breached an agreement between the two companies , the lawsuit accused the Weinstein Company of not contributing to monthly production accounts after February , 2009 , neglecting to consult Kanbar Entertainment of a release strategy , and not responding to proposed changes to the film , even though Kanbar Entertainment held " final authority on production decisions " . 
 The film was a financial failure , earning $ 16 @.@ 9 million worldwide ; only about half of its budget . Critical reception to the film was almost universally negative , with a Rotten score of 11 % across 61 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 20 / 100 on Metacritic . Cory Edwards expressed disappointment with the finished film , indicating that it was heavily altered from the original script and saying that it was " deflating to give this thing away and watch others run with it in ways I would not . " 
 = Interstate 275 ( Michigan ) = 
 Interstate 275 ( I @-@ 275 ) in the US state of Michigan is an Interstate Highway that functions as a western bypass of the Detroit metropolitan area . The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) maintains it as a component of the larger state trunkline highway system . The freeway runs through the western suburbs near Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport . Along its routing , I @-@ 275 crosses several rivers and rail lines in the area . The southern terminus is the interchange with I @-@ 75 near Newport , northeast of Monroe . MDOT considers the Interstate to run to an interchange with I @-@ 96 , I @-@ 696 and M @-@ 5 on the Farmington Hills – Novi city line , running concurrently with I @-@ 96 for about five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) . This gives a total length of about 35 @.@ 03 miles ( 56 @.@ 38 km ) , and signage erected by MDOT along the freeway reflects this definition . According to the Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) , the length is 29 @.@ 97 miles ( 48 @.@ 23 km ) because that agency considers I @-@ 275 to end at the junction with I @-@ 96 and M @-@ 14 along the boundary between Livonia and Plymouth Township . All other map makers , like the American Automobile Association , Rand McNally and Google Maps follow MDOT 's practice . 
 A highway roughly parallel to the modern I @-@ 275 was included in early planning maps for the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s . As plans developed through the 1960s and into the early 1970s , the freeway was to run from I @-@ 75 near Newport north to Novi and connect back to I @-@ 75 near Davisburg . Some plans in the 1970s had the northern Novi – Davisburg section numbered as a state highway M @-@ 275 . The southern half of I @-@ 275 was built in segments that were completed in January 1977 . Later that month , the state canceled the northern section because of local opposition . A later attempt to revive the proposal failed in 1979 . Additional plans to complete M @-@ 275 through Oakland County were kept on the drawing boards through the 1980s , but failed to materialize . M @-@ 5 ( Haggerty Connector ) opened along part of the former I @-@ 275 / M @-@ 275 right @-@ of @-@ way between 1994 and 2000 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 275 begins at exit 20 along I @-@ 75 in northeastern Monroe County . The surrounding area is farmland and residential subdivisions in the adjacent Frenchtown and Berlin charter townships near the community of Newport . The freeway angles to the northwest and crosses US Highway 24 ( US 24 ) , which is also called Telegraph Road . After this interchange , I @-@ 275 turns to the north , running east of Carleton , crossing the Canadian National Railway and Conrail Shared Assets lines north of exit 5 . At Will Carleton Road , the trunkline crosses into Wayne County . There it continues on a northerly path parallel to a CSX Transportation line through southern Wayne County . The freeway crosses the Huron River at South Huron Road , adjacent to Willow Metropark . 
 In the city of Romulus , I @-@ 275 begins to take on a more suburban character when it passes the southwestern boundary of the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport . There is access to the south side of the airport signed at Eureka Road and to the north side at I @-@ 94 . Between these two interchanges , I @-@ 275 begins to run to the northwest . Past I @-@ 94 , the highway crosses over the same CSX line and a Norfolk Southern Railway ( NS ) line and passes a campus of Wayne County Community College and the headquarters of the <unk> Corporation , a major auto parts supplier spun off from Ford Motor Corporation . Near these two complexes , the freeway turns north again , running parallel and to the east of Haggerty Road . The freeway crosses over another NS railroad line also used by Amtrak trains from Chicago and Pontiac , US 12 ( Michigan Avenue ) and M @-@ 153 ( Ford Road ) in Canton . I @-@ 275 crosses the Lower Branch of the River Rouge north of Michigan Avenue and the Middle Branch north of Ford Road It also crosses over the same CSX line a third time . North of the Middle Branch of the River Rouge in Plymouth Township , I @-@ 275 crosses Schoolcraft Road and another CSX line from Detroit . 
 The interchange with I @-@ 96 ( Jeffries Freeway ) on the border between Plymouth Township and Livonia is where the FHWA considers I @-@ 275 to end as they do not not any overlap with I @-@ 96 , however MDOT continues the designation on maps and signage to run concurrently with I @-@ 96 northward . I @-@ 96 merges from the east on the Jeffries Freeway and turns north ; from the west , the M @-@ 14 freeway merges and ends . At the time the freeway from this interchange northward to Farmington Hills was opened to traffic , it was dual signed as I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 275 , and the unbuilt segment of freeway from Novi to Davisburg that was to be either I @-@ 275 or M @-@ 275 was still an active proposal . I @-@ 275 is shown running concurrently with I @-@ 96 through Livonia and Farmington Hills on MDOT maps , and other map makers and mapping service providers such as the American Automobile Association , Rand McNally and Google Maps label their maps in accordance with MDOT and not FHWA . 
 North of the interchange with the Jeffries Freeway , the combined I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 275 curves to the east into Livonia , running parallel to Haggerty Road and continuing through suburban areas . The freeway has interchanges with 6 Mile and 7 Mile roads in the northwest corner of Livonia . I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 275 passes through an interchange with 8 Mile Road while crossing into Oakland County entering the southwest corner of Farmington Hills . North of 10 Mile Road , I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 275 crosses Grand River Avenue . Here the ramps start to connect with both directions of M @-@ 5 , the start of eastbound I @-@ 696 or the continuation of westbound I @-@ 96 . MDOT ends the I @-@ 275 designation at this massive interchange . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Original plans = = = 
 A north – south freeway was originally planned as an Interstate Highway allowing through traffic to bypass the city of Detroit . This plan was included in the 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways ( Yellow Book ) , an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System . The Yellow Book contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Detroit area including a north – south freeway east of the current I @-@ 275 corridor . The 1958 numbering plan for Michigan submitted by the State Highway Department had this route initially marked as I @-@ 73 . William Swanson in the MDOT Highway Planning Unit later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I @-@ 75 and I @-@ 275 between Newport and Davisburg ; I @-@ 75 would have bypassed downtown Detroit just as it bypassed downtown Flint and downtown Saginaw to the north , and the auxiliary number ( I @-@ 275 ) would have been used on the freeway through downtown Detroit . 
 The present @-@ day freeway was built in stages in the mid @-@ 1970s . In 1974 , the state highway map of the time showed the highway under construction , but no parts completed . The first four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) of the freeway were shown opened to traffic from M @-@ 153 ( Ford Road ) in Canton to Schoolcraft Avenue ( just south of the I @-@ 96 and M @-@ 14 interchange ) in Plymouth Township by the start of 1975 . The segment between US 24 and I @-@ 75 in Monroe County was open as well . The second phase was completed in the latter half of 1976 , when I @-@ 275 was extended north from Schoolcraft Avenue ( and the incomplete interchange with the future route of I @-@ 96 ) to the I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 696 interchange in Novi . Then on January 14 , 1977 , the remaining 23 @-@ mile ( 37 km ) section of I @-@ 275 between US 24 in Monroe County and M @-@ 153 in Canton Township was opened to traffic , completing the current freeway . The final cost to build the I @-@ 275 freeway was $ 145 million ( equivalent to $ 854 million in 2015 ) . 
 = = = Cancellation of northern segment = = = 
 The Michigan State Highway Commission canceled the northern section of the highway , originally planned to continue northward from Novi to a point near Davisburg and Clarkston , on January 26 , 1977 , after it spent $ 1 @.@ 6 million ( equivalent to $ 10 @.@ 4 million in 2015 ) the year before purchasing land for the roadway . This northern section was not planned as an Interstate Highway at that time , bearing the designation M @-@ 275 instead . Opposition to construction came from various citizens ' groups and different levels of local government . Additionally , both The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press opposed the project . The Detroit City Council , led by then @-@ Chairman Carl Levin , opposed the plan . Levin said at the time , " At last I think people are waking up to the dangers of more and more expressways . At some point we 've got to say enough . And I think we 've reached it . " The US Department of the Interior reviewed the state 's environmental impact study of the project and stated that the project , " will cause irreparable damages on recreation lands , wetlands , surface waters and wildlife habitat . " The total project to link Farmington Hills with Davisburg with the 24 @-@ mile ( 39 km ) extension would have cost $ 69 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 409 million in 2015 ) and saved drivers an estimated eight minutes off travel time around the city of Detroit . 
 = = = I @-@ 96 overlap = = = 
 The Jeffries Freeway project was in its final stages of construction in 1977 , linking the final 10 @.@ 5 miles ( 16 @.@ 9 km ) of I @-@ 96 at M @-@ 39 ( Southfield Freeway ) with the I @-@ 275 freeway . After it was completed , I @-@ 96 was routed to run concurrently with I @-@ 275 between Novi and Plymouth Township , and the segments of freeway through Farmington and Farmington Hills that were to be part of I @-@ 96 instead became part of an extended M @-@ 102 . 
 At the end of the 1970s , MDOT took part in a FHWA @-@ backed initiative called the Positive Guidance Demonstration Project , and the two agencies audited signage practices in the vicinity of the I @-@ 96 / M @-@ 37 and I @-@ 296 / US 131 interchange in Walker near Grand Rapids . MDOT determined that usage of the I @-@ 296 designation overlapping US 131 was " a potential source of confusion for motorists . " FHWA agreed with the department 's proposal to eliminate all signage and public map references to the designation in April 1979 . MDOT then received formal permission from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) on October 13 , and from the FHWA on December 3 , 1979 , to remove the redundant highway designation from signage and most maps . 
 Following this program , the Reflective Systems Unit at MDOT reviewed the state of two- and three @-@ way concurrencies along the highway system in Michigan . They approached the department 's Trunkline Numbering Committee and the district traffic and safety engineers on October 19 , 1982 , for proposals to reduce or eliminate the various overlapping designations to " avoid driver confusion and save funds " . Included on the initial discussion report was the I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 275 concurrency with a request for comments by November 5 of that year . When the unit released its final recommendations on March 17 , 1983 , no changes were proposed regarding the I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 275 concurrency . Other recommendations , such as removing US 2 and US 10 from overlaps with I @-@ 75 were implemented in later in 1983 and in 1985 , respectively . 
 = = = New extension plan = = = 
 A least one transportation study in the early 1970s identified the highway north of Novi as M @-@ 275 . The Oakland County Road Commission , local land developers , and local politicians supported building a highway along the route of M @-@ 275 to open up the area for development . After the January 1977 cancelation of M @-@ 275 as a full freeway , the state explored building the highway as a parkway instead . This parkway concept allowed at @-@ grade intersections that would have not been permitted had the highway been built as a full freeway , and included more landscaping and less grade separation . In September 1977 , the State Transportation Commission ordered MDOT to study alternatives to a freeway in the area , along with the possible widening of I @-@ 94 and US 23 and the improvement of local roads to handle increased traffic caused by the absence of an extended I @-@ 275 from the state 's freeway network . 
 The canceled highway project was revisited by the State Transportation Commission in 1979 as M @-@ 275 . The renewed interest came after a vote of local residents showed a desire for the road . The Michigan Department of State Highways and Transportation backed the proposal with the support of local officials around the highway and the highway lobby . The 22 @-@ year @-@ old proposal was deemed " necessary " by the department to alleviate highway congestion along other area highways . The Department of the Interior continued to oppose the highway on environmental grounds . M @-@ 275 would have cut through Dodge No. 4 State Park in Oakland County if completed . Another factor that helped sink the project was the rising costs . Estimates in 1979 placed a $ 100 million ( equivalent to $ 477 million in 2015 ) price tag on the project . 
 Despite funding increases for MDOT by the State Legislature , M @-@ 275 languished on the drawing boards . New plans in 1983 had addressed several of the environmental concerns by moving interchanges and rerouting around wetlands . These plans even canceled an extension of Northwestern Highway ( then M @-@ 4 , now part of M @-@ 10 ) to Pontiac Trail and a connection with M @-@ 275 . The state increased MDOT 's budget by $ 602 million ( equivalent to $ 2 @.@ 16 billion in 2015 ) , but left the M @-@ 275 project off a priority list . The Southeast Michigan Council of Governments ( SEMCOG ) continued to factor M @-@ 275 into regional transportation planning forecasts . SEMCOG 's position was that the location population that would be served by the new highway would rival 70 of Michigan 's counties combined , yet there was no four @-@ lane highways through the area . Opponents cited urban sprawl , which SEMCOG dismissed because the population was already in the area of the new highway . Transportation planners at an April 24 , 1985 , meeting of the West Bloomfield Republicans said that the highway extension " would make sense " but MDOT " is planning no new freeways and no major road construction " at the time . By the next month , MDOT had relinquished ownership of right @-@ of @-@ way in West Bloomfield Township , ending any further progress at building the roadway . Studies comparing the levels of traffic at various checkpoints along the existing I @-@ 275 showed that the freeway was only handling half of its rated capacity . At 8 Mile Road , the freeway carried 57 @,@ 000 vehicles in 1977 and 88 @,@ 000 vehicles in 1984 . This compared to a 1986 projection of 133 @,@ 000 vehicles daily . 
 After many years of inactivity , further work began along this same route to relieve traffic congestion in the area , but the resulting highway was designated as a part of M @-@ 5 rather than I @-@ 275 or M @-@ 275 . The first section of this freeway extension was opened in October 1994 . This extended a freeway from I @-@ 275 's previous terminus at I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 696 north to 12 Mile Road . A plan enacted by then Governor John Engler in 1995 angered road officials when funding was diverted from county road commissions to help complete state highway projects like the M @-@ 5 ( Haggerty Connector ) project . In 1999 , a second extension of M @-@ 5 was completed to 14 Mile Road , but only as an expressway . The final two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) between 14 Mile Road and Pontiac Trail opened to traffic on November 1 , 2002 . 
 = = = Bike trail = = = 
 MDOT built a bike trail parallel to I @-@ 275 in the mid @-@ 1970s . This I @-@ 275 Bikeway was constructed as a reply to the 1970s energy crisis . Since 2006 , the Michigan Trails & Greenway Alliance and MDOT have been working to improve the bike trail . At the time of the alliance 's initial studies , the trail was overgrown with vegetation in locations . Since a grand re @-@ opening in 2011 , the bike path has been called the I @-@ 275 Metro Trail . In the middle of 2015 , MDOT completed reconstruction of the bike trail , resulting in a paved trail from a junction with the Downriver Linked Greenways East – West Trail near South Huron Road in Huron Township northward to 12 Mile Road in Novi .

 = Fort Tigné = 
 Fort Tigné ( Maltese : Il @-@ Forti Tigné or Il @-@ <unk> ta ' Tigné ) is a polygonal fort in Tigné Point , Sliema , Malta . It was built by the Order of Saint John between 1793 and 1795 to protect the entrance to Marsamxett Harbour , and it is one of the oldest polygonal forts in the world . The fort was extensively altered by the British in the 19th century , and it remained in use by the military until 1979 . 
 Fort Tigné was restored in the early 21st century , and it is now in good condition . It has been on Malta 's tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1998 , as part of the Knights ' Fortifications around the Harbours of Malta . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background and failed proposals = = = 
 A watch post existed on Punta di Santa Maria ( now known as Tigné Point after the fort ) in 1417 . The post was probably a small unfortified structure , which was manned by three persons . The peninsula played a significant role during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565 , when the invading Ottomans built a battery on it in order to bombard Fort Saint Elmo . After the siege , the peninsula became known as Dragut Point after the Ottoman corsair Dragut . 
 The first proposal to build a fortification on Dragut Point was made by the Italian military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga in 1670 . He proposed a fortified city known as Borgo della Città Piccola , with a design similar to Fort Ricasoli . The proposal never materialized , probably due to a lack of funds . 
 In 1715 , Philippe de Vendôme made a second proposal , this time to build a casemated redoubt . A year later , René Jacob de Tigné proposed the construction of a large artillery battery , similar to other coastal batteries that were being built around Malta 's coastline at the time . 
 In 1757 , Lembi Battery , an outwork of Fort Manoel , was built on the northern shore of the peninsula . A bastioned entrenchment was proposed in the early 1760s , but it was never built . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The designs for Fort Tigné were eventually made in 1792 , possibly due to the threat of a French invasion . It was commissioned by Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan @-@ Polduc , and was designed by the newly appointed engineer of the Order , Antoine Étienne de Tousard . Construction began in 1793 under the supervision of <unk> Antonio <unk> , and was completed in July 1795 . The fort was named after the knight and military engineer René Jacob de Tigné , in recognition of his long years of service with the Order . Tigné also paid 1000 scudi for the construction of the new fort , while de Rohan paid about 6000 scudi . Another 500 scudi were donated by the Bali de Tillet , while the rest of the funds were paid by the Fondazione Manoel . 
 The new fort was quite small by eighteenth century standards , and it was more similar to a large redoubt than a fort . Despite this , its design was considered to be revolutionary , since it was one of the earliest polygonal forts to be built around the world . Fort Tigné was also the last major fortification built by the Order of Saint John . 
 Upon the completion of Fort Tigné , the nearby Lembi Battery was decommissioned and converted into a private residence . 
 In around 1797 , a proposal was made to build a fortified city occupying the entire peninsula , with Fort Tigné as its keep . Like the earlier proposals in the late 17th and early 18th centuries , nothing materialized from this plan . 
 = = = French invasion and occupation = = = 
 The fort first saw use during the French invasion of Malta in June 1798 . At the time , it was commanded by the Bavarian knight Joseph Maria von Rechberg , and had a garrison made up of men from the Cacciatori , who were a volunteer chasseur light infantry regiment , as well as some bombardiers from the ship San <unk> and some Maltese militia . Fort Tigné was armed with 28 guns and 12 mortars as follows , but only 15 of the guns were serviceable : 
 Twelve 24 @-@ pounder guns 
 Six 18 @-@ pounder guns 
 Six 12 @-@ pounder guns 
 Four 4 @-@ pounder guns 
 Six shell @-@ firing mortars 
 Six stone @-@ firing mortars 
 Fort Tigné was one of the few fortifications that actively tried to resist the invasion . On 10 June , the French attempted to capture it in a minor skirmish , but were successfully repelled . The fort also fired its guns in support of a counterattack by the Order 's navy against the French , and it prevented French ships from entering Marsamxett . 
 On 11 June , the French bombarded the fort from land and sea . The fort 's garrison fought back , and its commander , Rechberg , managed to bring in more ammunition from Floriana . On 12 June , the bombardment of the fort continued , but by then the French had captured Valletta , Floriana , and Fort Manoel . The Maltese militia left the fort , reducing its garrison to 80 men . By the end of the day , the ammunition had run out , and parts of the fort were damaged during the bombardment . When Rechberg and his soldiers attempted to escape , the French captured them , and the fort was in French hands by 13 June . 
 During the subsequent Maltese uprising and insurrection against French rule , Maltese insurgents built six batteries facing Fort Tigné , which was held by the French . By 1799 , its armament was reduced to 21 guns , which were as follows : 
 Seven 24 @-@ pounder guns 
 Six 18 @-@ pounder guns 
 Four 10 @-@ pounder guns 
 Four 4 @-@ pounder guns 
 = = = British rule = = = 
 Fort Tigné was officially taken over by the British military in September 1800 , and it became permanently garrisoned in 1805 . The parts damaged during the French occupation were repaired , but no major changes were initially made . In 1815 , after several years of British occupation , the fort was armed with 30 guns : 
 Fourteen 24 @-@ pounder guns 
 Twelve 18 @-@ pounder guns 
 Four 24 @-@ pounder carronades 
 In the 1860s , the British saw Fort Tigné as the ' perfection of a small fort without flanks ... capable of considerable resistance ' , and it was used as the prototype for other polygonal forts around the world . By then , it was armed mainly with 68 @-@ pounder guns . The parapet on the circular keep was demolished to make way for a single gun mounted on a traversing platform , similar to the ones found on the Martello towers . By 1864 , the fort was armed with eighteen 32 @-@ pounder guns , four 10 @-@ inch guns , and another 32 @-@ pounder on the keep . 
 The first major modifications were made between 1870 and 1875 , when some of the parapets with embrasures were demolished to make way for emplacements for RML 9 inch 12 ton guns . The remainder of the fort underwent further significant changes over the following years . In the 1880s , the British considered demolishing the fort and replacing it with a larger fortification , but in 1888 it was proposed that instead of demolition , the height of the ramparts should be reduced to the level of the glacis . In the 1890s , gun emplacements for breech @-@ loading ( BL ) guns were built on the glacis , while further modifications were made when parts of the structure were converted to gun crew accommodation or magazines . 
 Defence of Tigné Point was further enhanced with the construction of Cambridge Battery between 1878 and 1886 . Garden Battery was then built between 1889 and 1894 , covering the area between Cambridge Battery and Fort Tigné . Barrack blocks were constructed on the rest of the peninsula in the early 20th century . 
 The fort was included on the Antiquities List of 1925 . It was damaged by aerial bombardment during World War II . 
 = = = Recent history = = = 
 When British troops left Malta in 1979 , the fort was abandoned and fell into a state of disrepair . Parts of it were also vandalized . At some point it was also used as a desalination plant . 
 Since the early 2000s , the Tigné Point peninsula is being redeveloped by MIDI plc . The British barracks were demolished , and high @-@ rise apartments were built instead . In 2008 , MIDI plc also restored the fort as part of the project . The alterations made by the British , such as the BL gun emplacements , were also repaired , while landscaped gardens and walkways were built on the glacis . 
 There were a number of proposals on how to use the building , including for catering facilities , as a military museum , an exhibition space or as an art gallery . 
 = = Layout = = 
 The design of Fort Tigné was mainly based on the Lunette d <unk> , as well as the work of Marc René , marquis de Montalembert . The final design by Antoine Étienne de Tousard resulted in a revolutionary fortification , which made it one of the oldest polygonal forts in the world . 
 The most noticeable feature of the fort is the circular keep . This was modeled on the <unk> de <unk> of the Lunette d <unk> , and it also bears similarities to the tour @-@ <unk> built in Malta in the early 18th century ( the only surviving example is Vendôme Tower ) . It had two rows of musketry loopholes , and its roof contained a parapet with four embrasures . The latter was replaced with a sloping parapet to mount a single gun in the 1860s . The keep also contains the main gate , above which is a commemorative plaque . 
 The main body of the fort consisted of a diamond @-@ shaped structure made up of two flanks and two faces . The two faces and the right flank originally had embrasures , but they were dismantled in the late 19th century by the British . A blockhouse , with courtyards on either side , was located in the centre of the fort . 
 The main structure and the keep were surrounded by a ditch , which had three counterscarp musketry galleries . These were also significantly altered by the British . 
 The British also built three emplacements for breech @-@ loading ( BL ) guns on the fort 's glacis .

 The 2005 USC Trojans football team represented the University of Southern California in the 2005 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season , winning the Pacific @-@ 10 Conference ( Pac @-@ 10 ) , and playing for the NCAA Division I @-@ A national championship . The team was coached by Pete Carroll , led on offense by quarterback and 2004 Heisman Trophy winner Matt Leinart , and played their home games in the Los Angeles Coliseum . 
 With many of their starters returning , a highly ranked recruiting class , and a number one ranking before the season , the team had high expectations of repeating as national champions as they had nearly all of their offensive starters returning , although they had only two returning defensive starters from the previous year . The team went undefeated in the regular season with nine of their twelve wins by 17 points or more and were compared with the greatest teams in the history of college football . Once again ranked first in the Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) rankings , they were invited to the national championship bowl game at the Rose Bowl , where they lost to the Texas Longhorns . With a final record of 12 – 1 , they finished the season ranked second in the nation in both the Associated Press ( AP ) and Coaches ' Polls . 
 A number of players from the team won national awards with running back Reggie Bush becoming the school 's seventh Heisman winner before it was later vacated . Following the season , Bush was selected second in the 2006 National Football League ( NFL ) Draft and was followed by Leinart at tenth and nine other Trojans during the draft , with the team sending eleven players to the NFL that season . 
 On June 10 , 2010 , USC was forced to vacate two wins from the 2004 season , and all wins from the 2005 season , after an NCAA investigation into the football program ( and men 's basketball program ) declared Bush retroactively ineligible . Additional sanctions included a bowl ban in 2010 and 2011 , and the loss of 30 football scholarships ( 10 per year in 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 ) .

The team became only the second team to be ranked first in the AP Poll from pre @-@ season until the end of the season , and the tenth team to repeat as national champions . Returning fourteen starters from 2004 , including Heisman Trophy @-@ winning quarterback Matt Leinart , and with a 22 game winning streak , the Trojans were ranked at the top of the polls once again in the pre @-@ season .

The Trojans answered early in the second quarter with a field goal , however , two touchdowns , a Keller pass and a Keegan Herring rush , gave the Sun Devils an 18 point half @-@ time lead . Starting in the third quarter the Trojans got on track with a pair of rushing touchdowns to bring their deficit to four , and midway through the fourth quarter they took the lead on a quarterback sneak by Leinart .

 In a game that looked to be overshadowed by pre @-@ game hype and assertions of being the newest " Game of the Century " , the meeting between perennial rivals , Notre Dame and USC , called by some the second greatest rivalry in college football , would be the 77th meeting between the schools , who play for the Jeweled Shillelagh . The Irish , led by first – year coach Charlie Weis and junior quarterback Brady Quinn , were ranked ninth in the country . The Trojans had won three straight meetings with the Irish , each by 31 points . Expectations , however , were high that this game would be closer . 
 In a surprise move , after Weis insisted it would not happen , the Irish wore their alternate green jerseys for the game . The score was back and forth for much of the game , with the Irish leading 21 – 14 at half @-@ time after a pair of touchdowns by running backs Reggie Bush and LenDale White for the Trojans , and a rushing touchdown by Travis Thomas , a passing touchdown by Quinn , and a punt return for a touchdown by Tom <unk> for the Irish . The Trojans took a 28 – 24 lead with five minutes left in the game when Reggie Bush ran for his third touchdown of the game , however , Quinn answered with four complete passes and his own 5 yard touchdown run to give the Irish a 31 – 28 lead with less than two minutes remaining . On the Trojans last series , however , Leinart , after being sacked and facing fourth down with nine yards to go on the Irish 26 yard line , completed a 61 yard fade to Dwayne Jarrett to give the Trojans a last chance near the Irish goal line . After a series of plays including Leinart fumbling the ball out of bounds , the stadium clock incorrectly running out of time , and part of the Notre Dame student section rushing onto the field , the Trojans had the ball on the Irish 1 yard line with seven seconds remaining . Instead of opting for the field goal and going to overtime , Leinart tried to sneak into the end zone . When he was stopped , in a play that would come to be called the " Bush Push " , Bush pushed him over the goal line for the winning score of 34 – 31 . In the aftermath of the game , the Irish dropped to a 4 – 2 record for the season and dropped three places in the national rankings to 12th . The Trojans moved to 6 – 0 on the season , escaped with a 28 game winning streak , and remained first in the rankings .

A minute into the second quarter Reggie Bush ran for a touchdown , and , after a failed extra point attempt and the Huskies offense unable to move the ball , two minutes later returned a punt 84 yards for a touchdown . After another failed drive for the Huskies and another two minutes , Leinart threw his third touchdown of the game to give the Trojans a 34 – 10 lead . Stanback rushed for a touchdown with two minutes remaining before half @-@ time to cut their deficit in half , but Mario Danelo kicked a field goal as time expired to give the Trojans a 37 – 17 lead at half @-@ time . In the third quarter , Leinart threw his fourth touchdown of the game before he was replaced by backup Booty . A Booty interception , that was returned 76 yards by <unk> Goldson , gave the Huskies their last score of the game , and Booty 's touchdown pass to Patrick Turner proved to be the final score in the game , giving the Trojans a 51 – 24 win .

The Trojans scored first after Ayoob 's first of four interceptions in the game , on a LenDale White rush . Ayoob recovered after the interception , and led the Bears to a field goal to cut their deficit to four at the end of the first quarter . In the second quarter , Leinart rushed for a pair of touchdowns to give the Trojans a 21 – 3 lead at half @-@ time . After a pair of White rushing touchdowns , the Bears scored again on a Chris <unk> rush that ended scoring in the game , with the Trojans winning 35 – 10 .

After a rushing touchdown for the Bulldogs , the Trojans could only answer with a Mario Danelo field goal . A second passing touchdown by Pinegar and another Danelo field goal closed out the half with the Bulldogs leading 21 – 13 . The Trojans seemed to take control of the game in the third quarter with a Leinart touchdown run , a Reggie Bush touchdown run , and a Leinart touchdown pass that gave the Trojans a 13 point lead . Pinegar answered for the Bulldogs with his third touchdown pass of the game , but a 50 yard touchdown rush by Bush allowed the Trojans to keep the same lead , Two touchdowns in the fourth quarter , Pinegar 's fourth touchdown pass and a second rushing touchdown for the Bulldogs , gave them a 1 point lead with nine minutes left in the game . After a 65 yard run by Bush , White scored for the Trojans , who missed on a two – point conversion attempt . A Danelo field goal gave the Trojans a 50 – 42 lead , and the Trojans won after intercepting Pinegar with a minute left in the game .

 For their final regular season game the Trojans faced their cross @-@ town rivals , the eleventh – ranked UCLA Bruins , led by fourth – year head coach Karl Dorrell and quarterback Drew Olson . The Trojans got an early lead with a Mario Danelo field goal and did not slow down , scoring on a Leinart touchdown pass and a pair of rushing touchdowns by LenDale White and Reggie Bush . The Bruins were finally able to score midway through the second quarter with a field goal , and then four minutes later with another , but Bush ran for his second touchdown late in the quarter to give the Trojans a 31 – 6 lead at half @-@ time . In the third quarter , Leinart threw his second touchdown of the game , and then 13 seconds later , a fumble by the Bruins was returned by Justin Wyatt for another Trojan touchdown . Leinart threw his third touchdown of the game to White and White rushed for his second rushing touchdown before the Bruins would score on a Maurice Drew rush . With backups in the game , the Trojans scored on another rush , before Olson threw his only touchdown pass of the game with 11 seconds left . With the missed extra point , the Trojans won 66 – 19 , increasing their winning streak to 34 games , which tied them for the fourth longest winning streak of all @-@ time . With the win , they clinched the Pac @-@ 10 title , first place in the BCS rankings , and an invitation to the Rose Bowl , which served as the national championship game . 
 = = = = Rose Bowl = = = = 
 The Rose Bowl Game served as the BCS National Championship Game , and as a result of the Bowl Championship Series agreement , the Trojans , ranked first in the BCS and the Texas Longhorns , ranked second , would meet in the game . In the weeks leading up to the game , it had been referred to by numerous publications as one of the most @-@ anticipated match @-@ ups in college football history and even " the greatest college football game " of all time . 
 Less than three weeks before the game , USC 's Reggie Bush won the Heisman trophy ahead of second place finisher , and Texas quarterback , Vince Young . Bush had the second highest number of first place votes in Heisman history ( O.J. Simpson ) and the highest percentage of first place votes , while Young had a record number of second place votes . Bush 's 933 point margin of victory was the 17th highest in the history of the Heisman voting . The third finalist was Matt Leinart , winner of the Heisman trophy in 2004 . This meant that the Rose Bowl would mark the first time two Heisman trophy winners had ever played in the same backfield . 
 In the game , coach Mack Brown and his Texas Longhorns beat USC by the score of 41 – 38 and ended USC 's 34 game win streak . The game 's outcome was still in doubt late in the fourth quarter , when the Trojans tried to convert a fourth down play that would win the game for them . After they were stopped Young led the Longhorns on a touchdown drive that was capped by his fourth down rush for the twelve yard touchdown . 
 Since the game , the media , coaches , and other commentators have praised the game as one of the greatest ever .

ESPN analysts Mark May and Kirk Herbstreit declared , before the 2005 Rose Bowl had even been played , that the 2005 USC Trojans were the 2nd best college football team of the past 50 years ( May placed them behind only the 1995 Nebraska Cornhuskers ; Herbstreit behind only the 2001 Miami Hurricanes ) . Stewart Mandel of Sports Illustrated later observed that , although the team " may have had the greatest set of skill players in history , " " ESPN spent the better part of Christmas season comparing that Trojans squad to some of the most acclaimed teams of all time only to find out that they weren ’ t even the best team that season .

As a result , USC was placed on four years ' probation and forced to vacate its last two wins of the 2004 season ( including the 2005 Orange Bowl ) as well as all of its wins in the 2005 season . It was also banned from bowl games in 2010 and 2011 and lost 30 scholarships over three years . Running backs coach Todd McNair was banned from off @-@ campus recruiting for one year after the NCAA determined he 'd known about Bush 's dealings with the agents . The NCAA also forced USC to permanently disassociate itself from Bush . These sanctions have been criticized by some NCAA football writers , including ESPN ’ s Ted Miller , who wrote , “ It 's become an accepted fact among informed college football observers that the NCAA sanctions against USC were a travesty of justice , and the NCAA ’ s refusal to revisit that travesty are a massive act of cowardice on the part of the organization . That 's the take of all clear @-@ thinking people . ”
