 = Indraloris = 
 Indraloris is a fossil primate from the Miocene of India and Pakistan in the family Sivaladapidae . Two species are now recognized : I. himalayensis from Haritalyangar , India ( about 9 million years old ) and I. kamlialensis from the <unk> Plateau , Pakistan ( 15 @.@ 2 million years old ) . Other material from the <unk> Plateau ( 16 @.@ 8 and 15 @.@ 2 million years old ) may represent an additional , unnamed species . Body mass estimates range from about 2 kg ( 4 @.@ 4 lb ) for the smaller I. kamlialensis to over 4 kg ( 8 @.@ 8 lb ) for the larger I. himalayensis . 
 Indraloris is known from isolated teeth and fragmentary lower jaws . The jaw is deep under the last premolars , but becomes shallower towards the front . The lower premolars are elongate . The lower molars are shorter and broader than those of Sivaladapis . Indraloris may have been arboreal and at least partly frugivorous . When the first Indraloris fossils were discovered in the early 1930s , one was misidentified as a carnivoran and the other as a loris . The carnivoran identification was corrected in 1968 , and in 1979 Indraloris and the related Sivaladapis were identified as late survivors of Adapiformes , an archaic primate group . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Currently , Indraloris is considered to be a valid genus within the family Sivaladapidae , containing two named species : I. himalayensis from India and I. kamlialensis from Pakistan . A third species may be represented in the Pakistani material of Indraloris . However , Indraloris has had a complicated taxonomic history , and some of the known material was misidentified as members of other mammalian groups for decades . 
 In 1932 , British paleontologist Guy Pilgrim described two species from the Miocene of what is now India and Pakistan , Sivanasua palaeindica from <unk> ( Pakistan ) and Sivanasua himalayensis from Haritalyangar ( India ) . He attributed both to Sivanasua , a carnivoran genus otherwise known from Europe . The next year , American scientist G. Edward Lewis described the new genus and species Indraloris lulli from Haritalyangar , which he provisionally allocated to the family Lorisidae . The generic name , Indraloris , combines the name of the god Indra with the generic name Loris , and the specific name , lulli , honors Richard Swann Lull , at the time director of the Peabody Museum of Natural History . It was not until 1968 that American anthropologist Ian Tattersall noted that Pilgrim 's Sivanasua species had been misidentified ; he suggested that Sivanasua himalayensis was probably the same as Indraloris lulli , but left the affinities of Sivanasua palaeindica open . Tattersall , who also described additional material of Indraloris , continued to regard the animal as a lorisid . 
 Lewis had suggested that Indraloris might derive from the Adapidae , a primitive group of primates , and in the 1970s some authors provisionally placed Indraloris among the Adapidae . In 1979 , American and Indian paleontologists Philip Gingerich and Ashok Sahni reviewed Indraloris and the Indo @-@ Pakistani " Sivanasua " species . They recognized Sivanasua himalayensis and Indraloris lulli as representing the same species , Indraloris himalayensis , and created the new genus Sivaladapis for Sivanasua palaeindica and another species that had been named later , Sivanasua nagrii . Gingerich and Sahni considered both Indraloris and Sivaladapis to be adapids . 
 Several other authors suggested similar taxonomic rearrangements around the same time . In 1979 , Herbert Thomas and Surinder Verma agreed that Indraloris and Sivaladapis were adapids , but placed them in a subfamily of their own , Sivaladapinae . Also in 1979 , Frederick Szalay and Eric Delson placed Indraloris in its own tribe , <unk> , within Adapidae . In 1980 , Indian paleontologists <unk> Chopra and R.N. Vasishat placed both of Pilgrim 's Sivanasua species in Indraloris and argued that Indraloris lulli , Sivanasua himalayensis and Sivanasua nagrii all represented the same species — Indraloris himalayensis . They listed Sivanasua palaeindica as a second Indraloris species , I. palaeindica , and continued to regard Indraloris as a lorisid . Gingerich and Sahni published in more detail on Sivaladapis in 1984 . They then placed the two genera in a separate subfamily of Adapidae , called Sivaladapinae because that name was published two months before <unk> . In 1985 , Vasishat continued to classify Indraloris and Sivaladapis in a single genus , and Indraloris himalayensis and Sivaladapis nagrii in a single species , but other authors have not followed this classification . 
 In a 1998 review , primatologist Marc Godinot recognized Sivaladapidae as a separate family within the Adapiformes , and this classification has been followed since then . Several genera in addition to Indraloris and Sivaladapis are now allocated to Sivaladapidae , which is known from the Eocene through the Miocene of China , Thailand , Myanmar , India , and Pakistan . <unk> are notable for including by far the youngest adapiforms ; members of this group are otherwise known mostly from the Eocene , but several sivaladapids occurred during the Miocene . 
 Despite these taxonomic changes , Indraloris remained known from only two specimens ( the holotypes of Indraloris lulli and Sivanasua palaeindica ) until 2005 . Both of those specimens — an isolated first lower molar ( m1 ) and a mandible ( lower jaw ) fragment with m1 , respectively — come from Haritalyangar in the <unk> Formation . In 2005 , however , American paleontologists Lawrence Flynn and Michèle Morgan described five teeth of Indraloris from fossil sites in the older Kamlial Formation as a second species in the genus , Indraloris kamlialensis . The species was named after the Kamlial Formation . In addition , they suggested that two lower jaw fragments from the Kamlial Formation represented a third , larger species of Indraloris . 
 = = Description = = 
 Indraloris is known only from isolated teeth and fragments of the mandible . These show that Indraloris was a medium @-@ sized <unk> , somewhat smaller than Sivaladapis . In 1982 , Gingerich and colleagues estimated that Indraloris himalayensis may have weighed 3 @.@ 7 to 4 @.@ 3 kg ( 8 @.@ 2 to 9 @.@ 5 lb ) on the basis of allometric scaling of tooth size ; Flynn and Morgan estimated a body size of about 2 kg ( 4 @.@ 4 lb ) for I. kamlialensis . In general , the cingula ( shelves ) on the margins of the cheekteeth are weak in Indraloris . Among the two named species , I. kamlialensis is about 20 % smaller than I. himalayensis . The unnamed large Indraloris is similar in size to I. himalayensis . 
 The mandible is best represented by YGSP <unk> , one of two specimens of the unnamed large species of Indraloris . It preserves both the right and left sides of the dentary , back to the level of the fourth lower premolars ( p4 ) , but is also damaged at the front . The jaw is deep below p4 , but rapidly becomes shallower further to the front . The roots of two lower incisors and a much larger canine are preserved ; the three roots cluster together , with the canine root above the incisor roots , suggesting that these teeth shared some function . The mental foramen , an opening in the jawbone , is below p4 . A root for the deciduous second premolar ( <unk> ) is preserved on both the left and right sides , but the tooth itself is not and it is not possible to determine whether <unk> had one or two roots . The right permanent second premolar ( p2 ) is unerupted , but partially visible ; it is a blade @-@ shaped cutting tooth . The p3 bears a single cusp , somewhat anterior to the middle of the tooth , with crests descending from it towards the front and back , and weak cingula on the inner and outer sides . It is supported by two roots , which are close together . 
 Isolated lower premolars are known from I. kamlialensis . A p3 , YGSP <unk> , resembles that of YGSP <unk> in possessing a single large cusp connected to crests at the front and back . A heel is present at the back , part of a small talonid . The tooth has two roots . The p4 , represented by YGSP <unk> , is an elongate , two @-@ rooted tooth with a distinct trigonid at the front and talonid at the back . The protoconid is the highest cusp of the trigonid . Two crests descend from it at right angles in a lingual direction ( towards the inner side of the tooth ) : the protolophid towards the front , ending at the low paraconid , and the metalophid towards the back , reaching the elongate metaconid . The talonid basin is open lingually ; on the labial side , the hypoconid cusp is present . A crest , the cristid obliqua , reaches from the hypoconid forward towards the trigonid . No other cusps are visible in the talonid , but the specimen is worn and poorly preserved ; the posterolophid , a crest descending from the hypoconid , may end in a small hypoconulid . A weak cingulum is present on the labial side of the tooth between the protoconid and hypoconid . Another tooth , YGSP <unk> , is interpreted as a <unk> . It has a more closed trigonid ( with the protolophid and metalophid making a more acute angle ) , the protolophid is shorter , and the paraconid is indistinct . In the talonid , the hypoconulid and entoconid are distinct . The labial cingulum is strong . 
 The lower molar of Indraloris is known from four specimens . GSI <unk> , an m1 in a piece of jaw , is the holotype of I. himalayensis . YPM <unk> , the holotype of I. lulli ( = I. himalayensis ) was originally identified as an m1 , but Flynn and Morgan suggested in 2005 that it may be an m2 instead .. YGSP <unk> , the holotype of I. kamlialensis , is either m1 or m2 , but more likely the former . Part of the trigonid is broken off . YGSP <unk> , a very worn m1 in a piece of jaw , represents the unnamed large Indraloris . Vasishat suggested in 1985 that these teeth were instead p4s corresponding to molars referable to Sivaladapis , but this hypothesis has been disproven by the discovery of p4s referable to Indraloris . 
 Indraloris molars are short and organized in two main lophs ( lobes ) . They differ from Sivaladapis teeth in being shorter and broader , with a shorter talonid and a smaller hypoconulid . In Indraloris himalayensis lower molars , there are four main cusps ( protoconid and metaconid in the trigonid , hypoconid and entoconid in the talonid ) , which give the crown a rectangular aspect , although the labial cusps ( protoconid and hypoconid ) are placed somewhat anterior to their lingual counterparts . In I. kamlialensis , the entoconid is distinct from the hypoconulid , which is large , but the tooth is otherwise similar . The cusps are high relative to those of extant lorises and approximately equal in height . The cristid obliqua , a crest , descends from the hypoconid to a point on the lingual side of the protoconid . On the hypoconid , this crest forms a right angle with the posterolophid , which runs towards the hypoconulid in the back lingual corner of the tooth . Between the metaconid and entoconid , the talonid basin is open . In I. himalayensis at least ( the structure is damaged in the only known lower molar of I. kamlialensis ) there is a well @-@ developed hollow in the trigonid in front of the protoconid and metaconid . There is a labial cingulum between the protoconid and hypoconid . YGSP <unk> is so worn that little of its structure remains visible . It shows a short trigonid and a distinct entoconid . A small hypoconulid , close to the entoconid , is suggested by an enamel swelling . This specimen is fragmentary enough that it could also represent a catarrhine primate or a carnivoran . 
 The only known upper tooth of Indraloris is an M3 , YGSP <unk> . It is broken at the back labial corner . The main cusp is protocone ; among the other two cusps , the paracone is higher but the metacone larger . There is a spur at the back of the protocone , suggesting a rudimentary hypocone . The protocone is connected to the paracone by a protoloph , which lacks a small cusp ( the paraconule ) . No crest connects the protocone to the metacone , but there is a cingulum at the back margin of the tooth . The tooth bears a strong parastyle ( accessory cusp at the front labial corner ) and has three roots . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 Fossils of Indraloris have been found only in the Miocene Siwalik fossil beds of India and Pakistan . I. himalayensis is known only from Haritalyangar , a Late Miocene site in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh . This site has been dated to about 9 million years ago . This site has also yielded Sivaladapis nagrii . Indraloris kamlialensis is known from two sites in the province of Punjab , Pakistan , that are both dated to 15 @.@ 2 million years ago : <unk> and <unk> . Sivaladapis <unk> has also been recorded at both sites , and two lorisids are known from <unk> . The unnamed large Indraloris is known from <unk> and an older site , <unk> ( 16 @.@ 8 million years old ) . All are in the <unk> Plateau region . 
 Little is known about <unk> ecology . Gingerich and Sahni suggested that Indraloris was probably arboreal and that it may have been more frugivorous ( eating fruit ) than Sivaladapis , which they interpreted as a folivore ( leaf @-@ eater ) . Flynn and Morgan interpreted I. kamlialensis as a mixed feeder . The Late Miocene extinction of Indian sivaladapids may be related to a decline in forest cover in Asia and to competition by immigrating colobine monkeys . 
 = 42nd Military Police Brigade ( United States ) = 
 The 42nd Military Police Brigade is a military police brigade of the United States Army based at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord , Washington . It is a subordinate unit of I Corps . 
 First activated as a customs unit in post @-@ World War II Germany , the brigade has a long history with United States Army Europe . Its duties as a customs unit meant that the unit was garrisoned in Germany for over forty years from 1950 until 1990 , never seeing action in the American operations in the Korean War , Vietnam War , or the Persian Gulf War . It was deactivated during the post @-@ Cold War drawdown of the U.S. military . 
 Reactivated in 2004 , the brigade provides corrections and force protection for both I Corps and Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord . The brigade and its subordinate units have seen several tours in support of the Iraq War 's Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom . 
 = = Organization = = 
 The brigade is a subordinate unit of the I Corps , and is separate , meaning that it does not report to a division level headquarters , even during theater operations . 
 The brigade contains four prime components , all headquartered at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord . The Brigade 's three permanently assigned MP battalions are the 504th and 508th Military Police Battalions at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord and the 759th Military Police Battalion at Fort Carson . The Brigade also contains a Force Protection unit and a detachment for the Brigade 's Provost Marshal . 
 Additionally , with the reflagging of the 593rd Sustainment Brigade as an Expeditionary Sustainment Command , the 42nd became a subordinate unit to the 593rd ESC and <unk> for the 13th <unk> JBLM , WA .

 = = = Origins = = = 
 The 42nd Military Police Group traces its lineage back to the <unk> Military Police Detachment , which was established on 21 March 1949 , to fight organized and widespread black @-@ market activities which posed a serious threat to the German economy . The unit enforced <unk> Customs Regulations , investigated violations , controlled parcel post shipments of black marketable goods , and manned twenty @-@ three border stations used by US military personnel crossing the international borders of Post @-@ World War II , US occupied Germany . 
 In August 1950 , the US High Commission for Germany requested the services of the " Customs Unit , " later designated as the 42d Military Police Detachment , to control the eastward movement of restricted goods to " Satellite Bloc " countries . With the increase in tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union , this function was important to US interests in Europe . On 1 November 1952 , the detachment was relieved of its strategic export control function , which was subsequently was resumed by German authorities . In May 1955 , Germany regained sovereignty over its land from US military forces . The rights , privileges , and obligations of the foreign forces and their members stationed in Germany were then based on the Bonn forces convention , the forerunner of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Status of Forces Agreement ( NATO SOFA ) and the supplementary agreement that followed . As a result , the unit was charged with establishing customs controls within Germany . It was because of this responsibility that the unit would never be deployed in support of the Korean War or the Vietnam War . 
 = = = Cold War years = = = 
 On 25 January 1968 , Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment , 42nd Military Police Group was constituted in the Regular Army and activated in Germany . The group was charged with providing customs enforcement and maintaining liaison and cooperation with German customs authorities at all levels . In addition , the group is responsible for establishing customs policies and procedures for the Federal Republic of Germany and to negotiate with German authorities on questions of procedure and US forces entitlements arising from tax and customs issues within the NATO Status of Forces Agreement . It received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for its outstanding job performing this role . In 1969 , the group received its own distinctive unit insignia . 
 On 1 July 1974 , the 42d Military Police Group was transferred to the 15th Military Police Brigade , retaining its missions and affiliation with United States Army Europe . On 13 December 1974 , drug suppression and anti @-@ hijacking protection were added to the missions of the 42d Military Police Group . On 1 June 1976 , relieved from it assignment to 15th MP Brigade , the 42nd MP Group was reassigned to US Army Europe and Seventh Army and , on 21 October 1977 , placed under the 21st Support Command . 
 On 1 December 1977 , the Commander of the 42nd MP Group became the Executive Agent for all customs matters in US European Command . As the Executive Agent , the group commander provided staff supervision over the US Military Customs inspection programs in 11 countries throughout Europe . This responsibility included staff supervision of 169 military customs inspection programs operated by the US Army , US Navy and US Air Force . 
 On 21 January 1978 , the 42d MP Group was reassigned to Headquarters , US Army Europe / 7th Army ( Office of the Deputy Commander in Chief ) and converted into a major command . In August 1983 , the Commander of the 42d Military Police Group was also designated the USAREUR Executive Agent for customs for US Forces personnel in Germany . 
 The brigade 's responsibilities in Europe prevented it from being deployed in the Gulf War although many of its soldiers did participate in customs clearing much of the cargo and equipment that the US forces shipped back to the USA after the war . In August 1994 , the 42nd Military Police Group was deactivated with the military drawdown of US Military forces in Europe . In May 2004 , the still inactive unit was redesignated as a brigade , in preparation for its reactivation that fall .

 In late June 2004 , the 1st Military Police Brigade ( Provisional ) based at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord , Washington , received word that it would be reflagged as the 42nd Military Police Brigade . On 15 October 2004 the provisional brigade was deactivated and the 42d Military Police Brigade was activated as the I Corps Military Police Brigade . The next day , the brigade received its own shoulder sleeve insignia . Responsibilities of the Brigade at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord include the direction of inter @-@ service corrections operations at the Northwestern Joint Regional Corrections Facility , as well as emergency services and force protection operations for the Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord area . The unit received word from the Department of the Army that it would deploy to Iraq less than thirty days after activation . 
 The 42nd Military Police Brigade deployed to Baghdad , Iraq from November 2004 to November 2005 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom , relieving the 89th Military Police Brigade which had previously been assigned there . The brigade operated out of Forward Operating Base Volunteer during its tour . During this tour , subordinate units of the brigade were responsible for training cadets of the Baghdad civilian Police department . This training included law training , human rights education , first aid , and weapons training on Glock @-@ 19s and AK @-@ 47s . They also had a counter @-@ terrorism class for Iraqi officers . During the assignment , the brigade suffered several casualties , including multiple Soldiers killed by improvised explosive devices , and another Soldier killed in a rocket @-@ propelled grenade attack . Their organizational operation during the deployment received praise , and was the basis for the organization of subsequent Military Police brigades that deployed . After its return from Iraq , the Brigade 's operations were assumed by the 49th Military Police Brigade . The brigade received another Meritorious Unit Commendation for its work during the deployment . 
 The brigade received orders to deploy to Iraq again in spring of 2008 . Its assignment was to conduct theater wide internment facility and reconciliation center operations , as well as managing the Iraqi Correctional Officer Training academies . Subordinate units of the Brigade have been deploying to Iraq regularly . The 571st MP Company deployed for 15 months , from November 2006 until January 2008 . The 504th MP Battalion deployed to Iraq in July 2007 . Also deployed were the 54th and 170th Military Police Companies . 
 On 16 March 2008 , the brigade deployed again to Iraq , assuming command of Task Force Bucca from the 300th Military Police Brigade . The 42nd MP Brigade operated out of Forward Operating Base Bucca , located in the southeastern corner of Iraq near the port of Umm Qasr and the border with Kuwait . Duties of the Brigade during this deployment included force protection , operation of internment facilities , and detainee reconciliation , teaching Iraqi prisoners to read and write and training them in technical skills that will boost their employment potential . During the deployment , soldiers of the brigade worked closely with Iraqi police forces and United States Navy forces to operate the facilities . On 2 June 2009 , the brigade cased its colors and transferred command of Task Force Bucca to the 89th MP Brigade Tactical Actions Center . The brigade redeployed to Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord in mid @-@ June . The brigade received another Meritorious Unit Commendation for its work during the deployment .

 The Polikarpov I @-@ 185 was a Soviet fighter aircraft designed in 1940 . It was flown with three engines but all of them were either insufficiently developed for service use or their full production was reserved for other fighters already in production . The I @-@ 185 program was cancelled on 27 January 1943 . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 The I @-@ 185 , designed in early 1940 , was based on the I @-@ 180 , which was itself a development of the I @-@ 16 , but was virtually a new design . The monocoque fuselage was similarly built of ' shpon ' , molded birch plywood , and also had an integral fin , but it was considerably longer than that of the I @-@ 180 . The two @-@ spar , all @-@ metal wing was smaller and thinner than the I @-@ 180 's wing , nearly as thin as that of the Supermarine Spitfire 's wing at 13 % at the root and tapered to 8 % at the wing tip . The wing had a NACA @-@ 230 profile and was skinned in duralumin . <unk> powered split flaps and leading edge slats were fitted . The outer wing panels had 3 ° of dihedral . The fabric @-@ covered control surfaces were framed in duralumin . The protected 540 @-@ litre ( 119 imp gal ; 143 US gal ) fuel tanks were mounted between the wing center section spars . The I @-@ 185 used a conventional undercarriage with a retractable tailwheel . The unproven 1 @,@ 492 kW ( 2 @,@ 000 hp ) 18 @-@ cylinder , two @-@ row Tumansky M @-@ 90 radial engine was carried on welded steel tubes . It was fitted with a ducted spinner to improve cooling with the air expelled through gills as in the I @-@ 180 to provide additional thrust . The synchronized armament was mounted in the fuselage , two 7 @.@ 62 mm ( 0 @.@ 300 in ) ShKAS machine guns and two 12 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) Berezin UBS machine guns . A 500 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) bomb could be carried under overload conditions . The first prototype was completed in May 1940 , but the only available example of the M @-@ 90 did not provide enough power for take @-@ off . The prototype was modified to use another experimental engine , the 895 @-@ kilowatt ( 1 @,@ 200 hp ) Shvetsov M @-@ 81 radial , but this was not nearly powerful enough for flight tests . The I @-@ 185 ( M @-@ 81 ) finally took to the air on January 11 , 1941 , but it was decided not to waste further development and await a more powerful engine which was fortunate as the M @-@ 81 was cancelled in May 1941 . 
 A second prototype was completed at the end of 1940 with a 14 @-@ cylinder , 1 @,@ 268 kW ( 1 @,@ 700 hp ) Shvetsov M @-@ 82A radial engine . The forward fuselage had to be redesigned to accommodate the slimmer engine and the armament was revised to three synchronized 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) ShVAK cannon . The drawings for this engine installation was passed to Lavochkin and Yakovlev where they proved very useful in designing their own fighters using the M @-@ 82 engine , notably the Lavochkin La @-@ 5 . A third prototype was also built that used the larger and heavier Shvetsov M @-@ 71 radial engine of 1 @,@ 492 kW ( 2 @,@ 000 hp ) . The flight tests of both of the latter versions were interrupted by the German invasion in June 1941 and all three prototypes , plus the Polikarpov design bureau , were evacuated to Novosibirsk . 
 Flight testing resumed in early 1942 and the M @-@ 71 @-@ powered versions , which now included the re @-@ engined first prototype , proved to be faster than the Messerschmitt Bf 109F by 47 km / h ( 29 mph ) at sea level and 20 km / h ( 12 mph ) at 6 @,@ 000 metres ( 19 @,@ 685 ft ) with a top speed of 630 km / h ( 390 mph ) at that altitude . It was recommended for immediate production , even before it began combat trials in November 1942 . All three aircraft were assigned to the 728th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 3rd Air Army of the Kalinin Front and were tightly controlled to prevent the loss of the prototypes . For example , all sorties had to be flown over Soviet @-@ controlled territory and required the express permission of the 3rd Air Army staff to fly . Pilots ' reports were quite enthusiastic ; the 728th 's commander , Captain <unk> wrote : " The I @-@ 185 outclasses both Soviet and foreign aircraft in level speed . It performs aerobatic maneuvers easily , rapidly and vigorously . The I @-@ 185 is the best current fighter from the point of control simplicity , speed , maneuverability ( especially in climb ) , armament and survivability . " 
 Based on the glowing report by the NII VVS ( <unk> @-@ Issledovatel 'skiy Institut Voyenno @-@ <unk> Sil — Air Force Scientific Test Institute ) in early 1942 preparations began to put the I @-@ 185 ( M @-@ 71 ) into production . A ' production standard setter ( etalon ) ' aircraft was built in April 1942 with a redesigned engine cowling . Its gross weight increased by 144 kg ( 317 lb ) over the earlier prototypes , but the reduction in drag from the new cowling was significant and the top speed increased to 650 km / h ( 400 mph ) at 5000 meters . It underwent manufacturer 's tests between June and October and was submitted for the State acceptance tests on 18 November . However , flight testing was interrupted by the need to replace the engine between 17 December 1942 and 26 January 1943 . The new engine failed the next day and the aircraft crashed on 27 January . Flight tests were ordered to be continued with the original prototypes to validate the range figures , but the first prototype crashed on 5 April , killing the pilot as he attempted a dead @-@ stick landing . 
 All work to put the I @-@ 185 into production was cancelled afterwards , even with the M @-@ 82 engine , as they were all required for the La @-@ 5 fighter . Another reason cited was that the La @-@ 5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin @-@ Gorbunov @-@ <unk> LaGG @-@ 3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less disruption of the production lines . Another factor may have been that the La @-@ 5 required less duralumin to build , something in short supply at the time .

 The Battle of Kostiuchnówka was a World War I battle that took place July 4 – 6 , 1916 , near the village of Kostiuchnówka ( <unk> ) and the <unk> River in the Volhynia region of modern Ukraine , then part of the Russian Empire . It was a major clash between the Russian Army and the Polish Legions ( part of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Army ) during the opening phase of the Brusilov Offensive . 
 Polish forces , numbering 5 @,@ 500 – 7 @,@ 300 , faced Russian forces numbering over half of the 46th Corps of 26 @,@ 000 . The Polish forces were eventually forced to retreat , but delayed the Russians long enough for the other Austro @-@ Hungarian units in the area to retreat in an organized manner . Polish casualties were approximately 2 @,@ 000 fatalities and wounded . The battle is considered one of the largest and most vicious of those involving the Polish Legions in World War I. 
 = = Background = = 
 In World War I , the partitioners of Poland fought each other , with the German Empire and Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire aligned against the Russian Empire . The Polish Legions in Austro @-@ Hungary were created by Józef Piłsudski in order to exploit these divisions , serving as one of his primary tools for restoring Polish independence . 
 The Polish Legions first arrived in the vicinity of Kostiuchnówka during the advance of the Central Powers in the summer and autumn of 1915 , taking Kostiuchnówka on September 27 , 1915 . That autumn they experienced heavy fighting , with each side trying to take control of the region ; a less known battle of Kostiuchnówka took place from November 3 to 10 ; the Russians managed to make some advances , taking the Polish Hill , but were expelled by the Polish forces on September 10 . Polish forces held Kostiuchnówka , and due to their successes in defending their positions , several landmarks in the Kostiuchnówka region became known as " Polish " ( called such by Polish as well as by allied German @-@ speaking troops ) : a key hill overlooking the area became the Polish Hill ( Polish : Polska Góra ) , a nearby forest – the Polish Forest ( Polski <unk> ) , a nearby bridge over the <unk> – the Polish Bridge ( Polski Mostek ) , and the key fortified trench line – Piłsudski 's Redoubt ( Reduta <unk> ) . Polish soldiers built several large wooden camps ; the larger of which was known as Legionowo ( where the Polish HQ was located ) . During late autumn , winter and spring no one saw any major moves by either sides , but this changed drastically with the launching of the Brusilov Offensive in June 1916 . The Brusilov Offensive would be a major Russian victory , and the greatest of Austro @-@ Hungarian defeats . 
 = = Opposing forces = = 
 Facing the major Russian offensive , the II Brigade of the Polish Legions was deployed out of Kostiuchnówka , at <unk> and <unk> . The I Brigade held the lines advancing down the Polish Hill , Kostiuchnówka village ; the III Brigade , positioned to its left , held the lines near the <unk> village ; the Piłsudski 's Redoubt was the most advanced Polish position , just about 50 metres ( 164 ft ) facing head on the most advanced Russian redoubt , called the " Eagle 's Nest " . Further down the Polish Hill the Hungarian 128th <unk> Brigade took positions opposite the Polish right flank , the Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division opposite the left flank . Two Polish fall @-@ back lines were drawn beyond the first line of defense : one drawn through the Polish Forest and the Engineer 's Forest , and the second one through the villages of Nowe <unk> , Nowy <unk> , the camp of Legionowo and Nowa <unk> . The Polish Legions at Kostiuchnówka numbered from 5 @,@ 500 to 7 @,@ 300 ( 6 @,@ 500 infantry and 800 cavalry ) , with forty @-@ nine machine guns , fifteen mortars and twenty @-@ six artillery units . The Russian forces , composed of the most part of the 46th Corps ( primarily the 110th and <unk> Infantry Division ) , numbered 23 @,@ 000 infantry , 3 @,@ 000 cavalry and were backed up by a larger artillery force consisting of 120 units . 
 = = The battle = = 
 Starting on June 6 , a major Russian push was directed against the 40 km line between <unk> and Kostiuchnówka , with the aim of taking the position and then advancing towards <unk> . With Polish legionnaires staying put and holding the ground , more Russian reinforcements were thrown in , while the battle of Kostiuchnówka had become one of the major struggles in the area during World War I. Polish forces launched a counterattack , pushing back the Russians – who had not expected such a bold move – on the night of June 8 and 9 . 
 The major Russian push came on July 4 , after a major artillery pre @-@ emptive assault . The advancing Russian infantry , numbering around 10 @,@ 000 , faced about 1 @,@ 000 Polish troops in the front lines ( the rest were held in reserve ) , but the Russians were stopped by heavy machine gun fire and forced to retreat . The Hungarian forces at Polish Hill were pushed back , however , and the Russians advancing on the Poles ' right flank , threatened to take the high ground in the area . A counterattack by the Poles was not successful ; as the Hungarian units were retreating , the Polish forces sustained very heavy losses and had to fall back either to the remaining part of the first defense line or , in the area of Polish Hill , to the second line . Another Polish counterattack , launched during the night of July 4 / 5 , was also beaten back . Throughout the day , the Russian offensive managed to push the Polish forces further back ; although the Poles managed to temporarily retake Polish Hill , a lack of support from the Hungarian forces once again tipped the battle towards the Russians , and even German reinforcements – deployed after Piłsudski sent a report to the army 's headquarters about the possibility of a Russian breakthrough – failed to turn the tide away . Eventually , on July 6 , the Russian offensive forced the Central Powers ' armies to retreat along the entire frontline ; Polish forces were among the last to retreat , having sustained approximately 2 @,@ 000 casualties during the battle . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Brusilov 's offensive was stopped only in August 1916 , with reinforcements from the Western Front . Despite being forced to retreat , the performance of the Polish forces impressed Austro @-@ Hungarian and German commanders , and contributed to their decision to recreate some form of Polish statehood in order to boost the recruitment of Polish troops . Their limited concessions , however , did not satisfy Piłsudski ; in the aftermath of the Oath Crisis he was arrested and the Legions disbanded . 
 The presence of Piłsudski , who would later become the dictator of Poland , during the battle , became a subject of several patriotic Polish paintings , including one by Leopold Gottlieb , then also a soldier of the Legions , as well as of another painting by Stefan <unk> . Wincenty <unk> created a series of drawings and sketches on the dead and wounded from the battle . During the Second Polish Republic , several monuments and a mound were raised nearby to commemorate the battle . A 16 m mound with a stone obelisk and a museum with two additional obelisks were raised during the years 1928 – 1933 ; a military cemetery was also built . They fell into disrepair during the rule of the Soviet Union ( which often purposefully tried to erase traces of Polish history – the mound was for example lowered by 10 m ) . In recent years restoration work has taken place through various Polish @-@ Ukrainian projects , with notable projects carried out by Polish boy scouts . 
 The battle is considered one of the largest and most vicious of those involving the Polish Legions in World War I. Piłsudski in his order of July 11 , 1916 wrote that " the heaviest of our current fights took place in the recent days . " 
 = Dumas Brothel = 
 The Dumas Brothel was a bordello in Butte , Montana . The brothel was founded by French Canadian brothers Joseph and Arthur Nadeau in 1890 and named after the nominal owner , Delia Nadeau , née Dumas , who was Joseph 's wife . It grew considerably through the years , with the miners employed by the city 's copper mines often patronizing the establishment . After several changes of the " madams " and continuing pressure from authorities , the brothel closed in 1982 , described as " a rare , intact commentary on social history " . At the time of its closure , it was the longest operating brothel in the United States , having operated years after prostitution was made illegal . After closing , the brothel changed hands several times , eventually becoming a tourist attraction owned and managed by a series of Butte residents . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the 1870s , a group of women , called " ladies of the line " , began selling sexual services on Park Street , in the north of the city of Butte , Montana . When the tents and shacks on the street were replaced with legitimate businesses some years later , the " Park Street girls " , as they had come to be known , moved to the south of the city . By the mid @-@ 1880s , a variety of dance halls , gambling houses and saloons had appeared in the city . By 1888 , Butte 's East Galena Street was lined with brothels ; in fact , nearly every building on the street housed prostitution . This area of Galena Street would come to be known as the " twilight zone " . Paramount to these establishments was the Casino Theater , a mixture of a saloon , dance hall and brothel . In the late 19th century , several prominent <unk> owned brothels in Butte , including Lee Mantle , who would go on to be a United States Senator , and Anton M. Holter , a wealthy businessman from Helena , Montana . 
 Two French Canadian brothers , Joseph and Arthur Nadeau , would eventually acquire the most property in Butte 's prostitution areas , or " red light district " . The brothers built a brothel in 1890 on 45 East Mercury Street and named it for Delia Nadeau , née Dumas , Joseph 's wife . By the turn of the century , there were three high @-@ class sex houses in Butte : the Hotel Victoria , the Windsor Hotel and the Dumas Brothel , also called the Dumas Hotel . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Dumas Brothel is a two @-@ story brick building facing Mercury Street with a raised basement level and backing onto Venus Alley . The main levels feature a <unk> surrounded by balconies , which provided access to the suites . The basement afforded more basic accommodations , and was connected to Butte 's subterranean mining tunnel system . 
 = = History and operations = = 
 Scant details are known about the early history of the Dumas Brothel ; however , two early boarders of the house listed their occupations as " gambler " and " saloon man " in census records . By 1900 the brothel was occupied by Madam Grace McGinnis , her servant , a Chinese cook and four prostitutes . The cost of sex in the brothel at the turn of the 20th century was fifty cents , with the working girls receiving about 40 percent of that amount . Despite the size of the brothel , by 1902 Madame McGinnis had only five working girls and a musician under her employment . In 1903 the Dumas and businesses like it in Butte 's red light district were unusually lucrative ventures . These businesses were frequented by miners from the local Anaconda Copper Mining Company . That year , traffic grew to a point where the Dumas 's operations had to be expanded , building " cribs " ( tiny cubicles where the girls worked ) in the basement of the house . There were several ways potential clients could access the brothel . A back door of the Dumas opened into Pleasant Alley , near South Wyoming Street , which was the busiest section of Butte 's red light area . The basement cribs could also be accessed by a staircase from the front sidewalk . Even though the Dumas operated 24 hours a day with several girls taking three shifts , by 1910 there were only two women reported to actually be living there . Instead the prostitutes lived in other parts of Pleasant Alley , and commuted to the brothel for their shifts . In Butte , the activities of the city 's prostitutes were generally restricted to Galena and Mercury Street . From the windows of their street @-@ facing cribs , the girls would attract prospective clients in varying states of undress . The Butte Miner , a local newspaper , explained how the girls did this : 
 With an abandon that has no trace of modesty in it , these women lean out of their windows and address the vilest kind of language imaginable to people passing on the street , or else boldly make their appearance on the thoroughfare and visit from one crib to another . 
 The Dumas 's business and those like it were criticized by a number of people who sought to reform the red light district . Reverend William <unk> condemned Butte as " the lowest sinkhole of vice in the west , " and that he saw " enough legitimate vice in Butte to damn the souls of every young man and young woman in it . " <unk> held revival services for residents which attracted " rounders , gamblers and <unk> of the red light district " . However , the local business benefited and even depended on the support of the sex workers at the Dumas and other establishments like it . The prostitutes would buy their dresses at local clothiers , frequent the city 's dry cleaners and would patronize Chinese herbalists , looking for birth control potions and venereal disease remedies . To ensure that their operations were unhampered , the girls at the Dumas would pay the city 's police and governance five dollar " fines " . Instead of the closing or relocating the red light district , the mayor and police of Butte ordered that the women wear longer skirts and high @-@ necked blouses and that they " refrain from any indecent exposures . " After these ordinances were put in place , the Butte Miner reported that " nothing was seen in the district except long dresses and long faces . What the women say about the matter is not fit for publication . " By 1910 the people were petitioning Mayor Charles Nevin to shut down the district ; with the district contributing two thousand dollars to the city 's coffers every month , the efforts eventually died . 
 In 1913 the brothel was expanded again . A one @-@ story structure was added to the building , increasing the number of cribs by eight ; four of the added cribs opened directly onto Pleasant Alley , by that time known as Venus Alley . When copper prices went up , the more than 14 @,@ 000 miners in the city experienced a pay @-@ rise of twenty @-@ five cents and injected an additional $ 6 @,@ 000 into Butte 's economy . The Dumas also experienced an upswing in patronage . As a result of the added patronage , the brothel added five partitions and a staircase in 1916 , and the ground floor , once a grand parlor , was partitioned into cribs . 
 World War I and the Prohibition impelled local lawmakers to initiate a crackdown on Butte 's red light district ; by 1917 , the district was effectively closed . Signs saying " Men Under 21 Keep Out " were commonplace , and in the next census , prostitution had completely disappeared as a declared profession in Butte . The Dumas , however , remained in operation . In 1925 Anne Vallet began overseeing the Dumas for the Nadeau family , and in the 1930s , operations had passed to Madam Rose Davis . In 1940 Lillian Walden and her husband Dick began running the brothel , raising the price of sex at the brothel to $ 2 . Three years later , the US government ordered all brothels shut down to prevent the spread of venereal diseases among soldiers in World War II . In response , the Dumas began operating even more furtively , now under the guise of being a boardinghouse . The " window @-@ shopping " was abandoned completely and a heavy steel door was installed at the back of the Dumas with a small sliding window ; customers would only gain entrance after the sliding window was opened and their identity was acknowledged . Additionally , doorbells were added and a code system for dealing with troublesome guests was also employed . 
 When Lillian Walden retired in 1950 , the price for a woman at the brothel was $ 5 . Afterwards , the Dumas 's operations went to Elinore Knott . The <unk> also ceased being owners of the brothel around this time . Knott 's management of the Dumas was short . In 1955 she committed suicide after her lover died of a heart attack . When the late 1960s came about , several local police officers were taking the initiative to close the three operating high @-@ class sex houses : Hotel Victoria , Windsor Hotel and the Dumas . The Dumas did not remain closed for long however , with its next madam , Bonita Farren , operating it from 1955 until her death from cancer in 1969 . In 1970 the Dumas was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a " Victorian Brothel " and an active house of prostitution . By the following year , Ruby Garret , a local resident of Butte for some thirty years , had purchased the Dumas . Garret would pay local police officers and officials $ 200 to $ 300 a month in return for their silence about the Dumas 's activities . Under Garrett , the cost of a prostitute was $ 20 . She would come upon financial difficulties however , being charged with tax evasion in 1981 . The Dumas Brothel was closed the following year . 
 = = After closure = = 
 In 1982 Ruby Garrett , the last madam of the Dumas , was convicted of federal tax evasion and served six months in prison . The brothel was closed soon after , but not before a robbery took place there . When it closed , it was the longest operating brothel in the United States , having operated for 92 years , long after prostitution was outlawed . 
 Garret sold the Dumas to an antiques dealer named Rudy Giecek on the condition that it was preserved in its original state . Giecek turned the brothel into a museum and operated it as such for most of the 1990s . However , in 1998 Giecek encountered financial difficulties and attempted to sell the building . The International Sex Worker Foundation for Art , Culture and Education ( ISWFACE ) responded . The ISWFACE sought to reopen the Dumas as not only a museum but also a gallery and convention center . Ellen <unk> of the National Register of Historic Places wrote in support for the rescue of the Dumas that " [ it ] is not only significant as the last standing parlor house in this area of Butte , but also because of its length of operation as a rare , intact commentary on social history . " Some were against the restoration of the Dumas , including former prostitutes in Butte , but the operation proceeded — at least until September 2000 , when Giecek claimed the ISWFACE owed him $ 52 @,@ 000 in wages for work performed at the Dumas . Giecek sued and was granted the wages he petitioned for and additional penalties . The business deal with ISWFACE was terminated however . In the years that followed , the Dumas was put up for auction twice as Giecek did not have the money to maintain the building . 
 In late May 2005 Giecek was escorting a New York Times reporter through the Dumas for an interview when he discovered the place had been broken into . Giecek , low on funds and worried about his health , had shut down the Dumas earlier that month after it had operated offering $ 5 tours . After the robbery , Giecek discovered " dismantled beds , stolen antique lamps and artwork and emptied glass cases full of brothel artifacts " as well as missing " rare sex toys " . 
 In June 2012 the Dumas was conveyed to new owners , locals Michael <unk> and Travis <unk> . By this time however , the building was in great disrepair ; among other things , there was water damage , a collapsed wall and no structurally sound roof . The new owners planned to have summer tours for $ 8 in the following year , but their ultimate goal was turning the Dumas into a bed and breakfast . " It needs to be around . It needs to be here for the rest of the community and the people who want to visit it , " said <unk> . In late 2013 the duo sought a loan from the local urban revitalization body in Butte . The requested amount was $ 92 @,@ 000 with an additional $ 8 @,@ 750 grant . As of December 2013 , tours were still being offered at the Dumas on a limited basis . 
 Rudy Giecek claims that the Dumas is haunted by the ghost of Elinore Knott . Author Karen Stevens also recalled paranormal experiences related to the brothel . It is suggested that Knott 's ghost is one of several at the Dumas .

 Xabier " Xabi " Alonso <unk> ( Basque : [ <unk> <unk> ̺ o <unk> ] , Spanish : [ ˈ ( t ) <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; born 25 November 1981 ) is a Spanish footballer who plays for German club Bayern Munich as a central midfielder . 
 Alonso began his career at Real Sociedad , the main team of his home province Gipuzkoa . After a brief loan period at Eibar , he returned to Sociedad where then @-@ manager John Toshack appointed Alonso as his team captain . Alonso succeeded in the role , taking Real Sociedad to second place in the 2002 – 03 season . He moved to Liverpool in August 2004 for £ 10 @.@ 5 million . He won the UEFA Champions League in his first season at the club , under manager Rafael Benítez , scoring the equalising goal in the Final against Milan . The following season , he won the FA Cup and the FA Community Shield . He moved to Real Madrid for the start of the 2009 – 10 season in a deal worth around £ 30 million . After five seasons at the club , winning honours including a league title in 2012 and the Champions League in 2014 , he was signed by German Bundesliga club Bayern Munich on a two @-@ year contract . 
 He made his international debut for Spain in April 2003 in a 4 – 0 victory against Ecuador . While playing for Spain , Alonso has won Euro 2008 , Euro 2012 and the 2010 World Cup , and he has also represented his country at Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup . On 23 June 2012 , Alonso won his 100th cap for Spain in the quarter @-@ final of Euro 2012 against France ; he celebrated the occasion by scoring both of Spain 's goals to send them into the semi @-@ finals . Following Spain 's failure to progress out of the group stages at the 2014 World Cup , Alonso retired from international football on 27 August 2014 . His 114 caps make him the fifth @-@ most capped player in the nation 's history . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Alonso was born in the small town of Tolosa , Gipuzkoa , Basque Country , into a family known for its footballing prowess . His father , <unk> Alonso , won La Liga twice in successive seasons with Real Sociedad and a third time after he moved to FC Barcelona . He also featured in the national team , winning 21 caps over the course of his career . Xabi Alonso lived in Barcelona for the first six years of his life and moved to San Sebastián ( Donostia ) thereafter . It was here that his passion for football began as he <unk> away his childhood playing at Playa de la Concha ( Shell Beach ) . On the Basque sands , Alonso befriended a fellow resident of Calle <unk> , Mikel Arteta , and the two would battle each other in exhibitions of technical ability . He was immersed in football and his father would often bring him and his older brother , Mikel , to CE Sabadell 's training ground to practice together . Alonso was influenced by his father 's playing , taking more pleasure in passing the ball well than shooting at goal . At an early age , he decided to play as a defensive midfielder , a role which helped him learn how to distribute the ball well . This talent would later prove to be an integral part of his club and international career . 
 At the age of 15 , Alonso went to the Irish town of Kells , County Meath , on a school exchange programme to learn English . There , he helped the local Kells junior football team to win an All Ireland Junior club title in Keating Park , <unk> . 
 Alonso and Arteta were ambitious and dreamed of playing alongside each other for Real Sociedad when they were older . Though they attended different schools , the two young players joined forces at the local youth side <unk> , playing games at the weekend . Their performances attracted the attention of scouts from top Spanish sides and the young <unk> separated ways , ending nine years of friendly rivalry , as Alonso went to Real Sociedad and Arteta moved to Catalan giants Barcelona . Alonso 's move to Real Sociedad , however , was not a <unk> one , as he was joined by his older brother Mikel , who had also become an adept player . 
 Alonso progressed through the youth ranks and the reserve team at Real Sociedad and impressed enough to earn a first team debut at the age of 18 . He made his first senior appearance against CD <unk> in December 1999 in a Copa del Rey match . Alonso failed to make another appearance in the season but the following year brought more opportunities . At the beginning of the 2000 – 01 season , Javier Clemente sent Alonso to Segunda División team SD Eibar to gain experience . Alonso 's father particularly felt the move to the smaller club improved him as a player . A quick turnover of managers , however , including a two @-@ month period with <unk> Alonso in charge , left Real Sociedad in a dire situation . By January 2001 , Real Sociedad were bottom of the league and the new manager , John Toshack , turned to the prodigious Alonso in the hope of reversing the team 's fortunes . In a surprise move , the Welsh manager made 20 @-@ year @-@ old Alonso the team captain , a position traditionally held by more senior players . By the end of the season , Sociedad had climbed out of the relegation zone and finished in 14th place . Toshack lauded Alonso , noting that the impression he had on the team was exceptional , especially for a player from the youth team . 
 = = Club career = = 
 = = = Real Sociedad = = = 
 Under the tutelage of John Toshack , Alonso 's captaincy marked a resurgence of form for Real Sociedad . Toshack recognised Alonso 's potential and invested much time in his young captain , creating a training method designed to improve his touch and control specifically for him . The team cemented their mid @-@ table position in the 2001 – 02 , finishing in 13th place . Alonso appeared consistently in La Liga with 30 appearances over the course of the season and also scored his first league goal , finishing with a season total of three . Real Sociedad 's management changed again in the summer of 2002 , with the arrival of Raynald <unk> but Alonso kept his place in the first team on the strength of his past performance . 
 The 2002 – 03 season was the club 's best league performance since the 1981 – 82 season , in which they won the league . The Basque team finished second , two points behind Real Madrid , setting a club record for their highest ever points total , and qualifying for the UEFA Champions League for the first time . Alonso received much praise for his role in the team 's success , and was given the Best Spanish Player award by Spanish sports magazine Don <unk> . In addition , Alonso significantly contributed to the team 's goal tally , scoring 12 goals in all competitions . His performances earned Alonso national repute and Iñaki Sáez , the coach of the Spanish national team , called him up for La Selección . Alonso made his international debut in April 2003 in a 4 – 0 friendly win over Ecuador . Sáez raved over Alonso , saying , " He has a fantastic range of accurate passing [ and ] sees football with an extraordinary clarity . " 
 The 2003 – 04 season comprised mixed results for Alonso and his San Sebastián club . Alonso revelled in the opportunity to perform in Europe , appearing in all the team 's games , and Real Sociedad qualified for the knockout phase of the Champions League . The team struggled under the pressure of the extra matches , however , and were promptly knocked out of the tournament by Olympique Lyonnais and finished 15th in La Liga . The combination of Alonso 's outstanding performances and the team 's poor league finish made a move away from Estadio <unk> inevitable . Despite interest from La Liga champions Real Madrid , Alonso remained committed to Real Sociedad . Madrid failed to meet the £ 13 million price tag that José Luis <unk> , the Real Sociedad president , had placed on Alonso and the deal reached a stalemate . Alonso had other concerns and focused on international duty with Spain at the Euro 2004 tournament . Despite the fact that Alonso 's appearance at the tournament was brief , he caught the attention of retired footballer Jan Mølby , who was impressed with his precise passing abilities . 
 The summer transfer window at Real Sociedad saw the arrival of Alonso 's childhood friend Mikel Arteta . Arteta was ecstatic at the prospect of partnering Alonso in midfield but his excitement was short lived . Alonso was not picked for Real Sociedad 's pre @-@ season friendlies , signalling that an offer by Liverpool was being treated seriously . The Basque side announced on 20 August 2004 that they had made a deal worth £ 10 @.@ 7 million with Liverpool and Alonso had agreed terms with the Merseyside team . Alonso did not lament the fact that a move to Real Madrid had not materialised . Instead , he concentrated on integrating with the new Spanish contingent at Liverpool under the guidance of former Valencia CF manager Rafael Benítez .

 Alonso arrived at Liverpool along with Luis García from Barcelona , marking the beginning of a new era at Anfield . Liverpool 's new coach , Rafael Benítez , sought to revolutionise the club and completely overhauled the squad , impressing his own management style and tactics upon the team . The technical Spaniards were Benítez 's first signings and he remarked that their emphasis of skill over strength offered the team something different . Alonso made his Premier League debut for the Merseysiders against Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium on 29 August 2004 . Liverpool lost the fixture 1 – 0 but Alonso was already receiving praise for his passing skills from the press . A Premier League tie away against Fulham displayed more of Alonso 's talents . Liverpool were losing 2 – 0 at half @-@ time and Benítez brought on Alonso as a substitute after the break . He revived a deflated Liverpool and the game finished 2 – 4 to the Merseyside team . Furthermore , Alonso scored his first goal for the team from a free kick to bring Liverpool ahead of the opposition . 
 Alonso continued to provide important goals for the club , scoring his first goal at Anfield against Arsenal in a 2 – 1 victory . Alonso was elated at the achievement and felt he was settling in well in England . The Arsenal game marked the return of Steven Gerrard from injury but Alonso 's midfield partnership with the team captain came to a halt when Alonso suffered his first setback at Liverpool . Alonso 's ankle was broken following a tackle from Frank Lampard in Liverpool 's 0 – 1 home defeat against Chelsea on New Year 's Day 2005 and the Spaniard was ruled out of action for three months . 
 He made his return to the first team in the second leg of the Champions League quarter final against Juventus . Alonso was not at full fitness but , as Steven Gerrard was injured , he played for the full 90 minutes and Liverpool held the score at 0 – 0 in Italy , defeating the eventual Italian champions on aggregate . Kevin McCarra of The Guardian paid testament to Alonso 's skill and dedication to the game , saying , " This marvellously accomplished footballer testified in the Stadio delle Alpi that technique can overcome a serious physical disadvantage . " In the next round against Chelsea , Alonso received a yellow card in a tense and scrappy 0 – 0 draw at Stamford Bridge , making him suspended for the following fixture . Alonso was distraught that he would miss the game and vehemently contested the referee 's decision to no avail . Gerrard returned from injury for the second leg , however , and the captain steered his team to a 1 – 0 win with the help of a Luis García goal , qualifying for the final against Milan . 
 Liverpool 's fifth @-@ place finish in the Premiership left much to be desired but debut season glory still awaited Alonso in the form of the Champions League final . The team fell three goals behind Milan but completed a dramatic second @-@ half comeback . Liverpool , trailing 3 – 2 , were awarded a penalty and it was decided that Alonso would take the spot kick . While Dida , Milan 's acclaimed Brazilian goalkeeper , managed to save the penalty Alonso fired the rebound into the roof of the net , bringing the score to 3 – 3 . Extra time passed without a goal from either team and Liverpool won 3 – 2 in the penalty shootout . Alonso was praised for his pivotal influence on the team 's comeback and manager Benítez reinforced his importance to the team . Alonso was ecstatic with the win , commenting , " This is the best moment in my professional career . " 
 = = = = 2005 – 06 : FA Cup winner = = = = 
 Alonso was ever @-@ present in the first team in the 2005 – 06 season , largely avoiding injuries that had marred his first season at the club . The summer transfer window brought Peter Crouch to Liverpool and the striker 's height sparked accusations that the team would change to long ball tactics . Crouch denied this , highlighting that Alonso 's passing ability , alongside Gerrard , would define Liverpool 's style of play . Alonso faced more competition for his place in the form of new arrival Mohamed Sissoko . However , Steven Gerrard 's injuries and Rafael Benítez 's favouring of a 4 – 5 – 1 formation ensured Alonso 's place in the team . Alonso appeared in all of Liverpool 's games in the Champions League but the dominance shown in the previous season had gone as the team lost to Benfica in the knockout stage . 
 On 7 January 2006 , in an FA Cup third @-@ round tie against Luton Town , Alonso assisted Liverpool to a 5 – 3 comeback victory after being down 3 – 1 early in the second half . Alonso scored two impressive goals from distance : one from 45 yards , and the other 65 yards from goal ; behind the half @-@ way line . Consequently , Alonso 's goals marked a stroke of luck for a Liverpool fan who won £ 25 @,@ 000 from a £ 200 bet on Alonso scoring from within his own half . Alonso suffered an ankle injury in a 1 – 3 away victory over Portsmouth , putting his participation in the FA Cup final in doubt . However , he recovered sufficiently to start the game against West Ham United and Gerrard scored Liverpool 's third goal from Alonso 's free kick , pulling the team ahead of the opposition . Alonso , still affected by the injury , could not manage the whole 90 minutes and was substituted in the second half . Liverpool won on penalties without his help but Alonso still earned his first FA Cup winners ' medal .

 On 20 September 2006 , Alonso scored what the BBC described as " an outrageous strike " from his own half in a 2 – 0 Premiership win against Newcastle United . Andy Hunter of The Independent described it as " one of the most audacious goals in Anfield 's rich 115 @-@ year history . " Alonso rebutted claims that his 70 @-@ yard goal was all down to luck and stated that he took long range shots as part of his training routine . Despite the similarity of the goals struck from inside his own half , Alonso was in no doubt which was his best . He said , " I think this was better . The Luton goal bounced a few times , this one went quite straight . The Luton one was left @-@ footed – it was different – but I am quite happy to score the goal . " It was his first goal for Liverpool since the goal against Luton , making distinct history as the only outfield player in modern professional football history to score two consecutive goals from inside his own half of the pitch . 
 On 8 June 2007 , Alonso signed a five @-@ year contract , stating , " I knew there was interest from other clubs but it was always my idea to stay here . I have been here for three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters . I understand what Liverpool means to so many people . It is such a special club and I just didn 't want to leave . " The 2007 – 08 season started well for the Spaniard : Gerrard 's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6 – 0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County . However , the bright beginning was short @-@ lived as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training . The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back . Alonso 's determination and passion proved to be his downfall , and he later reflected , " I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast . But as a player you don 't want to come off , particularly when the team is winning and I stayed on . " 
 Alonso returned from injury at December 2007 , but over the following months he increasingly faced competition for a place in midfield from Javier Mascherano and Lucas . His role in Liverpool 's five @-@ man midfield role was assured , however , as Rafael Benítez regarded him as " a top class player , " stating that Alonso had the ability to change games and break down the opposition 's defence . Alonso made his 100th league appearance for Liverpool on 12 January 2008 against Middlesbrough . 
 The 2008 summer transfer window suggested a move away from Merseyside , as Liverpool pursued England international Gareth Barry to replace Alonso . By the start of the 2008 – 09 season , neither Alonso or Barry had moved club but the drawn @-@ out transfer saga had left the Spaniard feeling unsettled at Liverpool and unsure of his position in the team . However , the club 's fans did much to restore his spirits , supporting him on and off the pitch , and Alonso responded to this , saying : 
 " [ The fans ] couldn 't have done more to show me how they felt ... If I went out for lunch or a coffee , there was always someone who would come over and say , ' We 'd love you to stay ' . I 'm just glad that , in the end , nothing came of it [ the transfer ] because it wasn 't something I ever asked for . " 
 Despite the events of the summer , Alonso made a confident start to the season and both his peers and the press praised his strength of character , citing his influence as a factor in the team 's strong opening to the season . Alonso 's importance to the team was further underlined when he scored the only goal , through a deflection , in a 0 – 1 victory against Chelsea , making Liverpool the first away team to win at Stamford Bridge in over four years . Statistical analysis reflected Alonso 's good form : on 11 December figures from Opta Sports revealed that he was the first Premier League player to complete 1 @,@ 000 successful passes in the season . His last goal for Liverpool came in their 1 – 3 away win at Hull City on 25 April , striking after his free kick deflected off the Hull wall .

 Alonso completed his £ 30 million move to Real Madrid on 5 August 2009 . It has been suggested that he never wanted to leave the Anfield side , with his contract existing until at least 2012 , and that his departure was due to differences with Benítez . Former teammate Steven Gerrard said he was " devastated " by Alonso 's decision , and cited his departure as one of the reasons behind Liverpool 's poor run of form at the start of the following season . 
 Alonso was given the number 22 jersey in Madrid and played in a holding midfield position . He scored his first goal for his new team on 21 February 2010 , a penalty against Villarreal in a 6 – 2 win . Unless he was injured or suspended , Manuel Pellegrini started Alonso in every match of the Champions League and in La Liga in his first season at Real Madrid . In La Liga he helped the club finish with a club @-@ record 96 points , three points behind winners Barcelona . It was the third time in Alonso 's career that he helped his team set a new club record in terms of points gathered , while finishing in second position ( he achieved the same feat with Real Sociedad in 2002 – 03 and with Liverpool in 2008 – 09 ) . During his first season at Real Madrid , Alonso scored three goals and was considered one of the club 's " most consistent " players . Readers of Marca made him part of their La tiga team of the season , as their choice defensive midfielder ; the only other Real Madrid player featured was Cristiano Ronaldo . Alonso received the same accolade from ESPN <unk> . He was also a nominee in the LFP Awards , awards given out by the Liga de Fútbol Profesional , the Spanish Football league . Alonso was nominated in the Best Midfielder category , alongside Xavi and Javi Martínez . Several members of the Spanish press , as well as a number of Real Madrid supporters , gave Alonso a new nickname during the season : La Barba Roja ( The Red Beard ) .

 His second season at Real Madrid started with the arrival of a new manager , José Mourinho . He was given the number 14 jersey after the departure of vice @-@ captain Guti . He did not score any goals that whole season but was vital . While he believed that Real Madrid would win the league , the club only managed to win the Copa del Rey .

 Alonso started his third season at Madrid by scoring the second goal in a 2 – 2 draw against Barcelona in the 2011 Supercopa de España at the Santiago Bernabéu . On 21 September 2011 , he played his 100th official game for Real Madrid in the 0 – 0 draw against Racing de Santander . Alonso continued to be an undisputed force in the starting eleven and ultimately claimed the first league title of his career .

 On 29 April 2014 , Real Madrid defeated Bayern Munich 4 – 0 in the second leg of their UEFA Champions League semi @-@ final to qualify for the 2014 UEFA Champions League Final on a 5 – 0 aggregate win . Alonso received a yellow card after a sliding tackle on Bastian Schweinsteiger in the first half ; as he already had two before the match , this ruled him out of the final .

He scored his first goal for the club on 18 October 2014 , a free kick in a 6 – 0 win over Werder Bremen . 
 On 17 February 2015 , in his 100th Champions League appearance , Alonso was sent @-@ off for a second bookable offense in a 0 – 0 draw against Shakhtar Donetsk . Alonso was suspended for the return leg of the fixture , which Bayern won 7 – 0 . Alonso would go on to record his fourth goal , another free kick , against Porto in the Champions League quarter @-@ final . Bayern would go on to win 6 – 1 , advancing to the semi @-@ finals for a fourth @-@ straight season on aggregate , 7 – 4 . 
 On 28 April 2015 , Alonso was one of four Bayern players , all FIFA World Cup winners , to miss in a 2 – 0 penalty shootout defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the DFB @-@ Pokal semi @-@ final . He was also the only player to miss as they lost the shootout at the end of the 2015 DFL @-@ Supercup away to Wolfsburg , his attempt being saved by goalkeeper Koen <unk> . 
 On 18 December 2015 , Alonso signed a new contract with Bayern , keeping him at the club until 2017 .

 Liverpool 's 2007 – 08 season finished trophyless but the opportunity to win honours awaited Alonso in the form of the Euro 2008 tournament . Alonso featured mainly as a substitute but , with key players resting , he captained Spain in the final group game against Greece , earning the man of the match award . Despite a strong performance , he could not attain a starting position in the team , highlighting Spain 's strength in depth . Spain went on to win the tournament and he featured in four of Spain 's six matches . Speaking to Spanish journalist Guillem <unk> , he said that Spain 's victory was deserved and the players ' teamwork had been crucial to the team 's undefeated run in the tournament . The Basque was ecstatic at the achievement , declaring , " Right now , we 're all just living the moment . It 's incredible and we 're all walking around in a dream . It 's fantastic .

Spain were then eliminated from the tournament but did win their final match 3 – 0 against Australia and finished third in the group ; Alonso played 83 minutes in the match . 
 Alonso retired from international football on 27 August 2014 .

 = = Style of play = = 
 A complete , consistent , hardworking and versatile midfielder , Alonso is regarded as one of the best players of his generation , and is effective both creatively and defensively . Gifted with good technique , excellent vision , and varied passing range , he excels in the deep @-@ lying playmaking role , where he can best use his accurate long passing ability to create goal scoring chances for team @-@ mates ; he also possesses a powerful and accurate shot from distance , and he is an effective set @-@ piece and penalty kick taker . Due to his height , positioning , and physical characteristics , Xabi Alonso is also effective in the air , often contributing with headed goals from set pieces when advancing into more offensive positions . In addition to his creative attributes , he is also capable of excelling as a defensive midfielder due to his strength and powerful physique , combined with his tenacity , tactical intelligence , aggressive tackling and his ability to read the game . He has at times been criticised , however , for occasionally committing rash challenges , and for his tendency to lose his composure and pick up unnecessary cards for particularly hard fouls . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Alonso was regarded as a quiet and friendly person by his former teammates at Liverpool . He is married to Nagore Aranburu and the couple have three children : <unk> , Ane and Emma . Alonso stayed in Merseyside to be at her side while she gave birth , later saying , " It was a little frustrating to miss the match against Inter but I have to be with my family at times like these . " His decision to place his family ahead of a Champions League tie caused much friction with former manager Rafael Benítez . On 30 March 2010 , they had their second child , a girl named Ane Alonso Aranburu . Their third child and second daughter , Emma Alonso Aranburu , was born on 2 December 2013 . 
 Alonso and Arsenal player Mikel Arteta were neighbours on the same street while growing up in San Sebastián and also lived near each other in Liverpool . Alonso convinced Arteta to transfer to Everton after he told him how happy he was living in Liverpool . Alonso also helped persuade former Real Sociedad teammate Juan Ugarte to make a move to Wales by joining Wrexham in 2004 . 
 His brother , Mikel Alonso , plays for Spanish team Real Unión . He previously spent a season on loan at Bolton Wanderers in the 2007 – 08 season with an option for a permanent deal . However , the team opted not to extend the loan deal and he returned to Spain to train with Xabi Alonso 's former club , Real Sociedad . Alonso also has another brother involved in football , Jon , who works as a referee . 
 Alonso is a Meath Gaelic football supporter . His interest in the Irish sport stems from the age of 15 when he went to the Irish town of Kells , County Meath , and stayed with a family to learn English , where he played it in his spare time . 
 Even while playing at Real Madrid , Alonso has declared himself a Liverpool supporter and returns to watch games at Anfield when his schedule allows . He was quoted in The Times Online in 2011 as saying , " I am still a Liverpool fan and will be forever , absolutely " and that he will raise his Liverpool @-@ born son as a Red supporter . 
 In October 2014 , Alonso had a Twitter following of 8 @.@ 23 million , making him the tenth @-@ most followed sportsperson and eighth most followed footballer on the website .

 = New York State Route 32 = 
 New York State Route 32 ( NY 32 ) is a north – south state highway that extends for 176 @.@ 73 miles ( 284 @.@ 42 km ) through the Hudson Valley and Capital District regions of the U.S. state of New York . It is a two @-@ lane surface road for nearly its entire length , with few divided and no limited @-@ access sections . From Harriman to Albany , it is closely parallel to Interstate 87 ( I @-@ 87 ) and U.S. Route 9W ( US 9W ) , overlapping with the latter in several places . 
 NY 32 begins at NY 17 on the outskirts of the New York metropolitan area in Woodbury just outside Harriman , and ends at NY 196 east of Hudson Falls just south of the Adirondacks . In between , the road passes through the cities of Newburgh , Kingston , Albany , Cohoes , and Glens Falls . Outside of the cities , it offers views of the Hudson Highlands , Shawangunk Ridge , Catskill Mountains , and , during an overlap with US 4 north of Albany , the Hudson River . 
 The roads now making up the highway were originally part of several privately maintained turnpikes , which fostered settlements along the corridor . Once part of the former NY 58 , it has been NY 32 since 1930 . Only one of three letter @-@ suffixed spur routes remains . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Maintenance of NY 32 is split between the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) and the highway departments of several different jurisdictions . Within the cities of Newburgh and Watervliet , the route is entirely city @-@ maintained . In four other cities — Albany , Cohoes , Glens Falls , and Kingston — NY 32 is mostly locally maintained . The piece of the route in the city of Mechanicville , meanwhile , is city @-@ maintained north of Frances Street , a local street four blocks south of NY 67 . One last locally maintained section exists in the Albany suburb of Bethlehem , where the route is county @-@ maintained between Feura Bush Road and the Delmar Bypass . This section is co @-@ signed as County Route 52 ( CR 52 ) , which continues northwest of NY 32 to a junction with NY 140 near Slingerlands . 
 = = = Harriman to Newburgh = = = 
 Route 32 begins where NY 17 leaves the Quickway overpass west of the New York State Thruway toll barrier , just north of the Harriman village line in Woodbury . To the east is Woodbury Common Premium Outlets , across from Central Valley Elementary School of the Monroe – Woodbury Central School District . Beyond the mall , site of many major traffic jams , NY 32 descends into downtown Central Valley . 2 miles ( 3 km ) north is another of the Town of Woodbury 's hamlets , Highland Mills . Beyond the Rushmore Memorial Library at the north end of the hamlet the road bends slightly east upon reaching the southeastern foot of Orange County 's highest peak , Schunemunk Mountain . 
 Shortly after Highland Mills , the Port Jervis Line , operated by Metro @-@ North Railroad , crosses over on a high trestle . After crossing over Woodbury Creek and under the Thruway , NY 32 runs along the eastern side of the narrow valley between Schunemunk and the Hudson Highlands . This section of highway runs through mostly wooded terrain as it leaves Woodbury for Cornwall . 
 Just north of Mountainville and the north end of Schunemunk , the road crosses <unk> Creek downstream from the Woodbury Creek confluence . The intersection with Angola Road 0 @.@ 25 miles ( 0 @.@ 40 km ) to the south was once the beginning of the former NY 307 ; it is now the west end of County Route 107 ( CR 107 ) . Across the creek from CR 107 is <unk> Mills Road , another county road that leads to Storm King Art Center . 
 The road climbs gently out of the creek valley and enters development . At 1 @.@ 6 miles ( 2 @.@ 6 km ) north of Angola Road , it crosses the New Windsor town line and reaches the complicated five @-@ way intersection at the center of Vails Gate , intersecting NY 94 and the beginning of NY 300 . The next 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) include a middle turn lane as NY 32 becomes New Windsor 's main commercial strip . This section ends at Temple Hill Avenue , with Snake Hill to the west . The road remains heavily commercial as it enters the city of Newburgh as the wide Lake Street . 
 At Broadway ( NY 17K ) , Newburgh 's main street , NY 32 turns east . The brief , unsigned concurrency ends where 17K terminates at US 9W ( Robinson Avenue ) , at the former Broadway School . NY 32 , however , turns north again , beginning the first of several concurrencies with US 9W . 
 The two highways remain joined for the next 1 @.@ 2 miles ( 1 @.@ 9 km ) as they pass the Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux @-@ designed Downing Park and reach the city limit , where I @-@ 84 and NY 52 cross the highway heading towards the Newburgh – Beacon Bridge . Immediately beyond that junction , NY 32 separates from US 9W and heads northwest . 
 = = = Newburgh to New Paltz = = = 
 Newburgh has a commercial strip north of the city , featuring the Mid @-@ Valley Mall and another large shopping plaza built around a supermarket anchor . This development ends after 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) when 32 passes the Town of Newburgh 's <unk> Hill Park on the south , near a short drive to the summit observation tower . 2 miles ( 3 km ) more brings Route 32 to the center of the hamlet of <unk> Valley and an unusual junction with NY 300 . At what seems to be a conventional four @-@ way intersection regulated by a traffic light , both highways turn , and it is necessary to turn to the northeast to stay on NY 32 headed north . Traffic that goes straight at this intersection flows onto Route 300 . 
 From this intersection , NY 32 passes Chadwick Lake , the town 's reservoir , and continues straight north through much less @-@ developed , mostly wooded countryside for 4 miles ( 6 km ) to the Ulster County line , almost the point at which the woods diminish . Barely 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) into Plattekill , the highway crosses the Thruway again . It curves northwards shortly thereafter , retaining a slightly westward trend through mostly open fields near the Shawangunk Ridge . At 4 @.@ 5 miles ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) from the Thruway , NY 32 intersects US 44 and NY 55 in the center of another Town of Plattekill hamlet , Modena . A short distance beyond , the highway crosses into Gardiner , taking a wide bend around Locust Lawn , the Federal @-@ style home of early 19th @-@ century politician Josiah Hasbrouck . 
 North of Modena , the surrounding area becomes slightly more wooded near where NY 32 crosses into the Town of New Paltz . The highway curves before entering the village next to the campus of State University of New York at New Paltz . Two blocks north of campus , at New Paltz Middle School , it turns west at a traffic signal to join NY 299 as the village 's Main Street . 
 = = = New Paltz to Kingston = = = 
 While NY 32 officially remains concurrent with NY 299 all the way to the traffic light at the northern terminus of NY 208 , a sign at the <unk> Memorial Library , just before the center of downtown , directs northbound traffic on the highway down North Front Street . This shortcut allows that traffic to skip an often busy intersection and head out of the village on North Chestnut Street . Once past the village , the Ulster Board of Cooperative Educational Services ( BOCES ) building comes up on the west and the town hall along the east . NY 32 then becomes mostly rural again . 
 Over the next 5 miles ( 8 km ) , the road trends easterly until NY 213 joins it from the east right before the bridge over the Wallkill . Now concurrent , 32 and 213 bend away from the Thruway and pass through the hamlet of Tillson and then descend to cross Rondout Creek at the former village of Rosendale . Just after the crossing , at the Stewart 's , NY 213 leaves to the west along the creek , ending a 2 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) concurrency . 
 From Rosendale , NY 32 climbs up out of the Rondout valley and veers east into the hamlet of Maple Hill , where it crosses over the Thruway once again . It resumes a northerly course through Bloomington , and several miles further on crosses the Kingston city line . This entire segment of NY 32 is also concurrent with New York State Bicycle Route 32 . 
 = = = Kingston and Saugerties = = = 
 On its route through Kingston , NY 32 frequently changes streets and directions . It enters town as Boulevard and meanders to just past Washington Avenue , where it splits onto the more easterly <unk> Avenue and Fair Street for several blocks . NY 213 returns , merging from the south as Wilbur Avenue . The joined routes then turn onto Clinton Avenue for two blocks , then east onto Henry Street for about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) to Broadway , where NY 32 turns north and NY 213 ends . 
 Another 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) brings Broadway to the wide junction where I @-@ 587 and NY 28 both terminate . NY 32 follows Albany Avenue northeast to Flatbush Avenue , where it turns to assume an eastward course . This finally bends slightly north to East Chester Street near the city limit , where US 9W again comes in to begin a brief wrong @-@ way concurrency in which NY 32 north is US 9W south . It ends , unsigned , after 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 460 m ) with US 9W 's turn onto Frank Koenig Boulevard . 
 Continuing as Flatbush Road into the Town of Ulster , NY 32 is for the first time along its route east of US 9W and closer to the river . It encounters NY 199 at an interchange immediately west of the Kingston – Rhinecliff Bridge . Soon after , it passes Kingston – Ulster Airport . It remains on a northerly heading until 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of Saugerties , where it veers west and merges with US 9W again . The two routes cross Esopus Creek and enter the village , where Partition Street gives way to Main Street . At that T intersection , US 9W turns to continue north , while NY 32 picks up the new NY 212 and heads west out of town . 
 = = = The Catskills to Albany = = = 
 After one block of Main Street , NY 32 and NY 212 turn onto Market Street , then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block . As it crosses the railroad tracks and leaves the village , the road widens and becomes a commercial highway just before reaching a Thruway exit . This , the fourth time NY 32 has crossed the Thruway , is the first time it does so at an exit . Beyond the overpass , the concurrency ends when NY 32 turns and heads north once again . A tight nearby on @-@ ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway . NY 32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along this stretch . 
 At this point , the distance between NY 32 and the Thruway begins to widen . At the junction with Malden Turnpike ( CR 34 ) , Route 32 turns westward , toward the Catskill Escarpment , and starts climbing through some rock cuts . When Blue Mountain Road ( CR 35 ) comes in from the south , NY 32 resumes heading north , parallel to the ridge . 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from that junction , its only suffixed route , NY 32A , splits off to the west to provide direct access via NY 23A and <unk> Clove to <unk> and Hunter . 
 After crossing into Greene County , the road intersects NY 23A at an undeveloped junction . NY 32 remains in its straight course through the lowlands below the escarpment , passing through mostly woodlands and the hamlet of <unk> , then winding around the north side of Cairo <unk> before it joins with NY 23 at Cairo . After 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) , NY 32 leaves the divided highway to once again strike north as a two @-@ lane route . It trends west to its westernmost point until turning to the north @-@ northeast just south of Freehold . 
 North of Freehold the road begins to climb . Views south to the Catskills appear as it nears the center of Greenville , where it crosses NY 81 . 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) further on , NY 32 enters Albany County via Westerlo near the Basic Creek Reservoir . The climbing stops another mile after the county line , where Route 32 reaches its highest elevation , 1 @,@ 060 feet ( 320 m ) , on the plateaus south of the Helderberg Escarpment . The road starts to curve back east as the surrounding landscape opens up , with larger fields surrounding it and a slow descent to the Hudson beginning . 
 After sharing 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of road with NY 143 , crossing the northern end of <unk> Reservoir and descending the southern end of the Helderberg Escarpment , the road veers eastward toward Albany . To get there , it crosses into New Scotland just after the hamlet of Feura Bush and crosses a long bridge over the northern end of the busy rail yard northwest of Selkirk , where freight trains bound for New York City wait before crossing the Hudson at the Alfred H. Smith Memorial Bridge . 
 The landscape becomes more developed , though still rural , as the highway winds past a <unk> plant and other development accompanying the rail yard , entering the town of Bethlehem . At the southern corner of Delmar , NY 32 turns more to the east becomes a divided highway with grade intersections , the only non @-@ concurrent segment of Route 32 to take this form . This segment continues , largely undeveloped , as it intersects NY 335 and crosses under the Thruway for the last time before reaching its final concurrency with US 9W . 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) east of the Thruway , Route 32 again breaks from 9W and follows residential Corning Hill Road downhill to River Road , where it turns to the north again and crosses the Normans Kill into Albany , becoming South Pearl Street , and then paralleling I @-@ 787 for a short distance past the Port of Albany – Rensselaer before crossing underneath it .

 Route 32 follows South Pearl Street between the Mansion and Pastures neighborhoods , intersecting US 20 ( Madison Avenue ) near the approach to the Dunn Memorial Bridge , and then becoming one of the two main streets of downtown Albany . At Clinton Square and the Palace Theatre it intersects US 9 along Clinton Avenue . Near the city limits , NY 32 passes under I @-@ 90 . Upon crossing into the neighboring village of Menands , NY 32 bears onto Wolfert Avenue to access Broadway . Broadway , a business thoroughfare originating in downtown Albany , is designated NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route , for 0 @.@ 06 miles ( 0 @.@ 10 km ) south of Wolfert Avenue to the Albany city line . NY 32 occupies Broadway north of Wolfert Avenue , right at the former headquarters of Albany International , paralleling I @-@ 787 . I @-@ 787 's exit 6 ramps meet NY 32 in Menands , then NY 32 crosses over railroad tracks and soon leaves the village . NY 32 enters the hamlet of Schuyler Heights in the town of Colonie . After a short stretch the road enters the city of Watervliet where the name changes from Broadway to Third Avenue . The Watervliet Arsenal forces NY 32 to curve northeasterly as Ninth Street . Then at a traffic signal NY 32 turns left onto Broadway . 
 At 13th Street , NY 32 leaves Broadway and follows 13th two blocks west to an intersection with 2nd Avenue . Here , NY 155 begins and occupies 13th Street to the west of 2nd Avenue while NY 32 turns north onto 2nd . NY 32 continues in the vicinity of I @-@ 787 and its continuation , NY 787 , through Watervliet and back into the town of Colonie , this time it is through the hamlet of Maplewood , to Cohoes , where NY 787 ends at NY 32 near the convergence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers at New Courtland Street . Past NY 787 , NY 32 crosses the Mohawk River into Saratoga County and the town of Waterford , after crossing into the village of Waterford NY 32 crosses the Erie Canal before intersecting US 4 in the heart of the village . The two routes merge , forming an overlap northward along the Hudson River . 
 In Mechanicville , US 4 and NY 32 briefly overlap NY 67 . Farther north , the two routes split north of Stillwater at the southern edge of the Saratoga National Historical Park . While US 4 straddles the park to the east , NY 32 follows the southern and western extents of the park before rejoining US 4 south of Schuylerville . In Schuylerville , the two routes are concurrent with NY 29 for a short distance before exiting the village . To the north of the village in Northumberland , NY 32 separates from US 4 and heads northwest to Gansevoort , where it meets NY 50 . NY 32 continues north on the right @-@ of @-@ way of NY 50 to South Glens Falls , where US 9 joins NY 32 northward across the Hudson River into Glens Falls . 
 Shortly after entering the city , NY 32 turns onto Warren Street , splitting from US 9 and following the Hudson River east toward Hudson Falls . At Highland Avenue , NY 32 turns east , following Highland past Quaker Road ( NY 254 ) to Dix Avenue , where it merges east onto Dix . NY 32 remains on Dix into Hudson Falls , intersecting US 4 one last time north of the village before continuing through the intersection onto Burgoyne Avenue . The route follows Burgoyne Avenue southward around the northeastern portion of Hudson Falls to NY 196 , where NY 32 terminates . Burgoyne Avenue continues southwestward as CR 37 to US 4 in Fort Edward .

 = = = Old roads = = = 
 Route 32 was once made up of several privately owned turnpikes that stretched throughout New York . A stretch from Catskill to Cairo was also once part of the Susquehannah Turnpike . Created in April 1800 , the Susquehannah Turnpike began in Catskill and ended in Unadilla . The Susquehannah Turnpike aided the growth of Greene County , which until then had depended on steamboats on the Susquehanna River and Catskill Creek . The turnpike attracted business from the New England states , made shipping easier for the county 's farmers , and improved shipping from New York City . 
 The turnpike was no longer maintained by a private company after 1899 and the highway remained intact for over 75 years . In 1974 , part of the turnpike was added to the National Register of Historic Places . Route 32 was also part of the Orange Turnpike , which stretched from the New Jersey line to Newburgh . The turnpike , created three days after the Susquehannah Turnpike , follows the current routes of NY 17 and NY 32 . North of Newburgh , the road follows another old turnpike to the Route 300 junction and the old Plattekill Turnpike from NY 300 to Ulster County . 
 = = = Designation = = = 
 The segment of modern NY 32 between Albany and Mechanicville was designated as part of NY 6 in 1924 . From Mechanicville to Hudson Falls , the current routing of NY 32 became part of NY 30 . By 1926 , the portion of what is now NY 32 from Harriman to Newburgh was designated NY 58 . From Newburgh to Albany , NY 32 remained unnumbered at the time . When U.S. Routes were first assigned in New York in 1927 , the portion of NY 6 from Albany to Waterford was designated as the northernmost portion of US 9W . In Waterford , US 9W merged with US 9E and continued north as US 9 to Mechanicville , where US 9 turned west onto modern NY 67 . 
 In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , US 9W was truncated to Albany while US 9 was rerouted to follow a new stretch between Albany and Round Lake . The former routing of both routes along the Hudson River between Albany and Mechanicville , as well as the entirety of NY 58 and the portion of NY 30 from Schuylerville to Glens Falls was integrated into the new NY 32 , which followed its current routing between Harriman and the Stillwater community of Bemis Heights and from Schuylerville to Glens Falls . Between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville , NY 32 followed what is now US 4 along the Hudson River while the former routing of NY 30 between the two locations became NY 32A . At the same time , US 4 , which previously ended in Glens Falls , was rerouted south of Hudson Falls to end in East Greenbush . From Northumberland to Waterford , the route used what is now NY 32 . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 NY 32 has been realigned in several locations since its inception in 1930 . When the route was initially assigned , it passed through <unk> instead of bypassing it to the east as it does today . In the early 1940s , NY 32 was rerouted to follow a new highway east of the hamlet . NY 32 's former routing into <unk> was redesignated as NY 32A . The original NY 32A in Saratoga County — which was redundant to US 4 — was supplanted at this time by a rerouted NY 32 . The Bemis Heights – Schuylerville portion of the overlap between US 4 and NY 32 was eliminated in the 1950s when the original routing of NY 32 between the two locations was upgraded . Construction on the highway began in the mid @-@ 1950s and was completed by 1958 , at which time US 4 was rerouted to follow the riverside roadway . 
 In Bethlehem , a southern suburb of Albany , NY 32 was originally routed on Feura Bush Road between the hamlets of Feura Bush and Glenmont . North of Glenmont , NY 32 followed what is now NY 144 . In 1956 , the Albany County Board of Supervisors asked the state of New York to develop a highway that would reduce the amount of traffic on NY 43 ( now NY 443 ) in Bethlehem . The original plans released by the state in 1959 called for a four @-@ lane divided highway between NY 85 in New Scotland and US 9W in Bethlehem . The new road , known as the Delmar Bypass , would run south of the hamlets of Slingerlands , Delmar , and Elsmere , and loosely parallel Feura Bush Road to the north between Elm Avenue and US 9W . 
 By February 1961 , however , the state favored a new alignment that brought the bypass north from Elm Avenue to Slingerlands , where it would connect to the proposed Slingerlands Bypass north of NY 85 . As a result , the road would run through the western part of Delmar and the eastern section of Slingerlands . The change in plans was met with stiff opposition from area residents at a February 8 public hearing , and the Bethlehem Town Board unanimously voted to oppose the altered route at a meeting one week later . Both actions eventually led the state to cancel the portion of the route west of Elm Avenue in January 1963 . The 3 @.@ 37 @-@ mile ( 5 @.@ 42 km ) portion east of Elm Avenue was completed in December 1963 and became part of a realigned NY 32 in the 1970s . Part of the right @-@ of @-@ way for the Delmar Bypass near Slingerlands was eventually used for a realignment of NY 140 named Cherry Avenue Extension . NY 32 's former routing along Feura Bush Road is still state @-@ maintained as NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route . 
 NY 32 ended in downtown Glens Falls until January 1 , 1949 , when the highway was extended east to US 4 in Hudson Falls by way of Warren Street , Boulevard , and Feeder Street . On April 1 , 1980 , ownership and maintenance of Boulevard between Highland Avenue and the Washington County line was transferred from the state of New York to Warren County in exchange for control over Highland and Dix avenues between Warren Avenue and the Washington County line . In Hudson Falls , Boulevard and the segment of Feeder Street south of Boulevard were given to Washington County on April 1 of the following year in return for ownership and maintenance over all of Dix and Burgoyne avenues north of NY 196 . NY 32 was rerouted to follow Highland , Dix , and Burgoyne avenues shortly afterward .

 In June 2008 , NYSDOT began a rehabilitation project of the bridge over Rondout Creek in Rosendale . The 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) project involved rehabilitating the bridge one half at a time . The project was slated to have the 74 @-@ year @-@ old bridge up to standards by the fall of 2009 . It also included improvements to the road leading up to the bridge . Having only one lane open at a time congested traffic in the area . The total cost of the project was $ 5 @.@ 5 million . The bridge had been refurbished before , in 1970 .

 In several locations , traffic congestion along Route 32 has led to suggestions to change or modify the road . The problems are most severe at the southern terminus , but it is not the only section of the road with issues . 
 = = = Woodbury Commons = = = 
 The road 's southern terminus at Woodbury Commons is the most frequent topic of discussion , especially since Black Friday in 2001 , when heavy traffic from holiday shoppers along adjacent sections of not only 32 but routes 6 and 17 and the Thruway came to a complete standstill . " This should have been planned for and it wasn 't " , complained one local official . " Now you 're trying to close the door and the horse is already out " . Despite several efforts and the presence of state police on later Black Fridays , a similar traffic jam occurred on Labor Day weekend 2006 , when a break in bad weather led to an increase in shoppers so marked that US 6 and the Thruway were backed up as far as Newburgh and the Palisades Interstate Parkway , respectively . The Woodbury police chief cited the blockage created by drivers making the left turn from Route 32 to the Thruway as the cause . Plans to build an exit ramp that would allow that traffic to go directly to the tollbooth have been expedited . 
 On the weekend of August 17 – 18 , 2009 , another serious traffic jam occurred , in which it took some drivers two hours to get to the Thruway from the mall . Officials cited several factors : the heavy traffic on Route 17 that weekend for both the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Music Festival in Sullivan County and the observances of the anniversary of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum 's death in <unk> Joel , a few miles to the west . A traffic light that had been malfunctioning after a recent lightning strike may also have contributed . 
 In 2007 , New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) officials announced their long @-@ term plan to prevent further traffic jams . They will create a series of loops and overpasses allowing traffic to go directly from southbound Route 32 to the Thruway and remove some traffic lights in front of the mall . The changes were expected to be complete by 2011 , as part of improvements to convert the Route 17 expressway into I @-@ 86 . However , in 2009 they were postponed due to funding constraints . Work was slated to begin in 2013 , but just before it could start Governor Andrew Cuomo redirected the money to repair projects elsewhere in the state . The project was put on indefinite hold in 2014 until it could be funded . 
 In 2016 , DOT announced a new five @-@ year capital spending plan that included the Exit 131 project . Construction is not expected to begin until 2018 at the earliest . Before it begin , the agency says it must acquire 7 @.@ 4 acres ( 3 @.@ 0 ha ) , permanent easements over another 1 @.@ 1 acres ( 4 @,@ 500 m2 ) and temporary easements over 28 acres ( 11 ha ) . The revised plan , DOT says , will allow it to shorten the timetable and complete the project in one phase instead of the two originally planned . It is expected to cost $ 115 million . 
 = = = Vails Gate = = = 
 The " Five Corners " intersection of NY 32 and NY 94 at Vails Gate was a four @-@ way junction until World War II , when the Army extended Temple Hill Road , later NY 300 , southeast to the junction so that troops and materiel could get between West Point and the airbase at what was then Stewart Field more quickly . It did not become a traffic problem until the 1990s , when gas stations , supermarkets , strip malls and fast @-@ food restaurants had been built on every corner . 
 By the end of the 20th century , the intersection was handling 30 @,@ 000 drivers a day , from increasingly developed Cornwall , Newburgh and New Windsor . NYSDOT expanded the intersection with middle @-@ turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches . Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars ' stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses . In 2001 state officials said they had done everything possible to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners . Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning . 
 = = = Downtown New Paltz = = = 
 Another choke point has been Main Street in New Paltz , a section shared by NY 32 and NY 299 . This is the main route back to the Thruway and downstate from the heavily used hiking and climbing areas at Mohonk Preserve and Minnewaska State Park Preserve in the Shawangunks . It is also a well @-@ developed commercial area in a college town , with ample street parking . 
 Traffic through the village has been so heavy on weekends during summer and peak leaf peeping weekends in early autumn that many residents have proposed making Main Street one @-@ way , carrying traffic only to the west , while diverting eastbound traffic onto either of two parallel streets . Other villages that have made such changes found making streets one @-@ way decreased business at their retailers . 
 After four years of studying and reviewing the issue , the town and the village agreed to make the change . In 2007 , however , the village 's new mayor , who had supported the plan while a trustee , changed his mind and said the village 's support was " on hold " . While campaigning , he said , few village residents had expressed support for the plan . What he learned since taking over as mayor had only further convinced him that it was mostly town residents who wanted the street changes . He also believed that making Main Street one @-@ way would reduce the total amount of routes available to vehicles passing through the village and would adversely route traffic away from the businesses along Main . 
 = = Suffixed routes = = 
 Originally , NY 32 had two suffixed routes , NY 32A and NY 32B , that were absorbed by other routes . The NY 32A designation has since been revived for a short connector in the Hudson Valley . 
 The NY 32A designation has been used for two distinct highways : 
 The first NY 32A was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the segment of modern NY 32 between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville in Saratoga County . At the time , NY 32 was routed on what is now US 4 between the two locations . The route was supplanted by a realigned NY 32 in the early 1940s . 
 The current NY 32A is a 1 @.@ 92 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 09 km ) connector between NY 32 and NY 23A in Ulster and Greene counties . It was assigned in the early 1940s . 
 NY 32B was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering to an alternate route of NY 32 between Northumberland and Glens Falls in Saratoga , Washington , and Warren counties . It was truncated northward to Hudson Falls in the early 1940s and mostly replaced by NY 254 c . 1965 .

 = Henry Martin Tupper = 
 Henry Martin Tupper D.D. ( April 11 , 1831 – November 12 , 1893 ) was a Baptist minister who founded Shaw University in Raleigh , North Carolina . Beginning with bible and literacy classes in December 1865 , it was the first university established for African Americans following the end of the civil war , and the oldest historically black college and university ( HBCU ) in the Southern United States , as well as one of the oldest co @-@ educational universities in the country . When the institute moved into a new building in 1871 , it was renamed as Shaw Collegiate Institute in honor of a major donor . Tupper served as the University 's first president from its founding until his death in 1893 . 
 = = Early life and military career = = 
 Henry Martin Tupper was born on April 11 , 1831 to Earl and <unk> Norris Tupper and raised on a farm in Monson , Massachusetts . He was the eldest of nine children . His grandfather , Ezra Tupper , and great @-@ grandfather , William Tupper , had both fought for the colonies in the American Revolutionary War . His paternal ancestry has been linked to a family of prominent Lutheran dissenters who left Germany and settled in England during the reign of Henry VIII . He was a distant relative of Martin Farquhar Tupper , an English poet of the 19th century . Clergyman Thomas Tupper , an ancestor of Henry Martin Tupper , emigrated from England to Barbados in the early 17th century . He later helped found the town of Sandwich , Massachusetts . 
 Neither of his parents were practicing Christians nor did Martin attend church as a child . He received little formal education until he turned eighteen , when he enrolled in Monson Academy . He converted to Christianity while at the Academy . In order to fund his continuing education , he took a job as a school teacher in New Jersey , where he was baptised in a nearby Baptist church . Later he joined a congregation in Wales , Massachusetts , near his hometown of Monson . 
 Tupper attended Amherst College and graduated in 1859 . He received his divinity degree from Newton Theological Institute in 1862 . While at school , he organized bible studies for African @-@ American youth . He also worked as a missionary among recent immigrants in Boston as part of his training . He had planned to serve as a missionary to Africa , however the Civil War intervened . Shortly after being ordained as a minister , he enlisted in the Union Army . Though his education would have qualified him for a military commission , there were no openings in the officer corps , so he enlisted as a soldier . 
 Tupper was assigned to the Army of the Potomac , Ninth Corps , under the command of Ambrose Burnside . He participated in the Battle of Fredericksburg . He was transferred to General Sherman 's Fifteenth Corps in time for the Vicksburg Campaign . He was injured at the Battle of Jackson . 
 Though Tupper was not an officer , he frequently served as a chaplain , ministering to sick and injured soldiers , and organizing prayer meetings and bible studies among soldiers . While in the army , he became acquainted with the plight of African @-@ American slaves . This inspired his later work . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 On January 25 , 1864 he married Sarah Baker Leonard of Stafford , Connecticut . She later joined him in his work , helping teach freedwomen as he taught the men . They had two children , Elizabeth Caroline and Edward Leonard Tupper . Sarah 's older brother Judson Wade Leonard , a successful businessman in woolen textiles , helped support Shaw University financially . The medical school was named for him . 
 = = Founder and president of Shaw University = = 
 After the Civil War , Tupper was commissioned by the Home Mission Society to act as a missionary to freed slaves in the American South . Discharged from the Union Army on July 14 , 1865 , he and his wife Sarah departed for Raleigh , North Carolina on October 1 to begin his work . Traveling via train through Portsmouth , Virginia , they had delays due to extensive damage to the rail network caused by the Civil War ; they arrived in Raleigh on October 10 . The <unk> began working among the freedmen . He procured food and clothing from the Freedman 's Bureau to help support the many homeless black men in Raleigh . 
 On December 1 , 1865 , Tupper began teaching bible study classes to freedmen in the Guion Hotel ( located where the North Carolina Museum of History is now located ) . This first bible class marks the traditional foundation date of Shaw University . He used the class as an opportunity to teach the freedmen to read and write , encouraging them to become Baptist ministers , and start their own congregations . In March 1866 , Sarah Tupper began teaching freedwomen in similar classes . 
 Having outgrown his temporary location at the Guion Hotel , Tupper purchased a plot of land , using $ 500 saved from his military service . On the plot , located at the corner of Blount and Cabarrus streets in Raleigh , he constructed a two @-@ story timber building to serve as both a school and church . He named this the Raleigh Institute ; it was the first permanent home what would develop as Shaw University . The Home Mission Society and the Freedman 's Bureau jointly provided funding for the Institute . 
 As the school grew , Tupper searched for more space . Nearby to the south was the estate of Paul Barringer , the patriarch of a prominent North Carolina political dynasty . When the land came up for sale , Martin Tupper raised $ 13 @,@ 000 for its purchase , mostly from private donors solicited personally by Tupper . The largest single donor was Elijah Shaw , a resident of Wales , Massachusetts , who donated $ 5 @,@ 000 . 
 In his honor , the first building on the new campus was named Shaw Hall , and the school was renamed the Shaw Collegiate Institute . Tupper and his students and faculty moved into their new location in 1871 . Expansion proceeded quickly , as the first men 's dormitory opened in 1872 , and the first women 's dormitory , Estey Hall ( named for another Northern benefactor , Jacob Estey of Brattleboro , Vermont ) , opened in 1874 . 
 Under Tupper 's leadership , the school became chartered by the state as a university in 1875 . It added a medical and pharmacy program ( Leonard Medical School ) in 1881 , and a law program in 1888 . Each of these programs were the first of their kind for African @-@ American students . Note : Howard University , a historically black university , dates its law school to 1869 , when a law department was established by John Mercer Langston . 
 Tupper 's role as the founder of the first university dedicated to educating freedmen attracted opposition . During the Reconstruction era , his home was burned to the ground by the Ku Klux Klan . He and his wife fled and hid in a nearby cornfield . In 1870 the trustees of the local Second Baptist Church of Raleigh sued Tupper on charges of defrauding its members in relation to his fundraising for Shaw College . The suit was settled in his favor in 1875 .

 Tupper died on November 12 , 1893 following a prolonged illness . His funeral was reportedly one of the most attended in the history of Raleigh to that time . Tupper was buried on the campus in front of Shaw Hall .

 Avatar : The Last Airbender ( Avatar : The Legend of Aang in some regions ) is an American animated television series that aired for three seasons ( referred to as " books " in each episode 's title card ) on Nickelodeon from 2005 to 2008 . Avatar : The Last Airbender is set in an Asiatic @-@ like world in which some people are able to manipulate the classical elements by use of psychokinetic variants of Chinese martial arts , known as " bending " . The show combines the styles of anime and American cartoons , and relies on the imagery of various East Asian , Inuit , Southeast Asian , South Asian , and New World societies . Therefore , whether or not the series can be considered as an anime work is often discussed . 
 The series follows the adventures of protagonist twelve @-@ year @-@ old Aang and his friends , who must bring peace and unity to the world by ending the Fire Lord 's war against the other three nations . The pilot episode first aired on February 21 , 2005 , and the series concluded with a widely praised two @-@ hour episode on July 19 , 2008 . The show is obtainable from various sources , including DVD , the iTunes Store , the Zune Marketplace , the Xbox Live Marketplace , the PlayStation Store , Netflix , Amazon Video , and the Nicktoons Network . 
 Throughout its run , Avatar : The Last Airbender was universally acclaimed by audiences and critics alike . Praises went to the art direction , humor , cultural references , characters , and themes . It was also commercially successful , garnering 5 @.@ 6 million viewers on its best @-@ rated showing and receiving high ratings in the Nicktoons lineup , even outside of its 6- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old demographic . The series has been nominated for and won awards from the Annie Awards , the Genesis Awards , a Primetime Emmy Award and a Peabody Award , among others . The first season 's success prompted Nickelodeon to order second and third seasons . 
 In other media , the series has spawned a critically panned , but financially successful , live @-@ action film , titled The Last Airbender , directed by M. Night Shyamalan ; scaled action figures ; a trading card game ; three video games ; stuffed animals distributed by Paramount Parks and two Lego sets . An art book was also released in mid @-@ 2010 . A sequel series , The Legend of Korra , aired from 2012 to 2014 . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Avatar : The Last Airbender takes place in a world home to humans and hybrid animals , adjacent to a parallel Spirit World . Human civilization is divided into four nations : the Water Tribes , the Earth Kingdom , the Fire Nation , and the Air Nomads . Each nation has a distinct society , wherein people known as " benders " have the ability to manipulate and control the element of their nation using the physical motions of martial arts . The show 's creators based each bending style on an existing Chinese martial art , leading to clear visual and physical differences in the techniques used by Waterbenders ( tai chi ) , <unk> ( Hung Ga kung fu ) , Firebenders ( Northern Shaolin kung fu ) and Airbenders ( Baguazhang ) . In addition to these four types of bending , there are several minor subcategories of bending within them , including but not limited to : Metalbending , <unk> ( Earth ) ; Lightning generation and redirection ( Fire ) and Bloodbending , Healing , <unk> ( Water ) . 
 At any given time , only one person in the world is capable of bending all four elements : the Avatar , who serves as an international arbiter . When the Avatar dies , the Avatar spirit is reincarnated into the next one of the four nations in the Avatar Cycle : the Fire Nation , Air Nomads , Water Tribe , Earth Kingdom , in order . An Avatar incarnation is born male or female , and is required to master each bending art in seasonal order , starting with its native land 's element . Additionally , the Avatar can enter a trance known as the Avatar State : normally a defense mechanism until placed , by mental discipline , under control , wherein the current Avatar briefly gains the knowledge and abilities of all past Avatars . If an Avatar were to be killed while in the Avatar State , the reincarnation cycle would end and the Avatar would never again be reborn . Through the various incarnations , the Avatar maintains a relative equality among the nations while serving as mediator between humans and spirits . The origin of the Avatar cycle is revealed in the sequel series The Legend of Korra , as the result of a young man named Wan combining his soul with the spirit Raava to imprison her opponent , Vaatu . The sequel series also revealed that bending was originally bestowed by the immense Lion Turtles , before these giant creatures renounced their roles as mankind 's protectors upon the creation of the Avatar . 
 = = = Backstory = = = 
 The backstory of the series ( told largely through flashback sequences ) extends backward to over 100 years before the time period in which the bulk of the series takes place , but these prelude events are revealed slowly in a fragmented , non @-@ linear manner . More than a century before the opening events of the series , Fire Lord Sozin , ruler of the Fire Nation , planned a world war to expand his nation 's territory and influence , but was prevented from carrying out his plans by Avatar Roku . 
 After Roku 's death , the Avatar was reincarnated as an Airbender , named Aang , who learned of his Avatar status when twelve years old . Aang , frightened of his new responsibilities and of separation from his mentor Gyatso , fled his home on his flying bison , Appa . The two were forced into the ocean by a storm , with Aang entering the Avatar State and encasing them both in an iceberg , in suspended animation , for one hundred years . 
 Sozin , knowing the nature of the Avatar 's reincarnation cycle , carried out genocide of the Air Nomads during the passing of a comet that increased the Firebenders ' firepower , with the comet later renamed after him as a result , and spent his remaining days searching for the eponymous " Last Airbender " . As the Fire Nation 's Hundred Year War continued , Sozin was succeeded as Fire Lord by his son , <unk> , who in turn passed the title to his youngest son , Ozai , who becomes the primary antagonist of the series . 
 = = = Season One ( Book One : Water ) = = = 
 Katara , a fourteen @-@ year @-@ old Southern Tribe <unk> , and her older brother , Sokka , find and revive Aang and Appa . Aang learns of the war occurring in his absence , and the siblings join him to reach the Northern Water Tribe at the North Pole , so that he and Katara can learn Waterbending from a master . Aang 's return attracts the attention of prince Zuko , the exiled son of Ozai , who pursues the three thereafter . Aang is also pursued by Zhao , a Fire Nation militant who intends to win Ozai 's favor and rob Zuko of his redemption . 
 En route to the North Pole , Aang meets the Kyoshi Warriors ( established by an eponymous previous Avatar ) and his childhood friend , King Bumi , attempts to learn Firebending from the deserter Firebending master , Jeong Jeong , and gains a traveling companion in a winged lemur he names Momo . Aang discovers the genocide of his people while visiting the Southern Air Temple . During the winter solstice , Aang meets his predecessor , Roku . 
 At the Northern Water Tribe , Aang and Katara learn advanced Waterbending from its Master , Pakku , while Sokka falls in love with Princess Yue , the tribal chief 's daughter .

Ozai is depicted as a cruel and merciless leader , and is described as " the worst father in the history of fathers " by his son Zuko , of whom he reportedly thought banishment too light a punishment .

 Avatar : The Last Airbender was co @-@ created and produced by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank , California . Animation work was mostly done by three animation studios in South Korea : JM Animation , DR Movie , and MOI Animation . According to Bryan Konietzko , the program was conceived in the spring of 2001 when he took an old sketch of a balding , middle @-@ aged man and re @-@ imagined the character as a child . Konietzko drew the character herding bison in the sky , and showed the sketch to Mike DiMartino . At the time , DiMartino was studying a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole . Konietzko described their early development of the concept : 
 The co @-@ creators successfully pitched the idea to Nickelodeon vice president and executive producer Eric Coleman just two weeks later . 
 The series was first revealed to the public in a teaser reel at Comic @-@ Con 2004 , and aired February 21 , 2005 . In the United States , the first two episodes of the series were shown together in a one @-@ hour premiere event . A second twenty @-@ episode season ran from March 17 , 2006 , through December 1 . A third and final season , beginning September 21 , 2007 , featured twenty @-@ one episodes rather than the usual twenty . The final four episodes were packaged as a two @-@ hour movie . 
 Avatar : The Last Airbender is notable for borrowing extensively from East Asian art and mythology to create its universe . The series ' character designs are heavily influenced by Chinese art , history , Hinduism , Taoism and Buddhism , and Yoga . Traditional Chinese calligraphy styles represent nearly all the writing in the series . For each instance of calligraphy , an appropriate style is used , ranging from seal script ( more archaic ) to clerical script . The show employed a cultural consultant , Edwin Zane , and calligrapher Siu @-@ Leung Lee as consultants for the series ' cultural influences . The choreographed martial art bending moves were affected by Asian cinema . In an interview , Bryan revealed that , " Mike and I were really interested in other epic ' Legends & Lore ' properties , like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings , but we knew that we wanted to take a different approach to that type of genre . Our love for Japanese anime , Hong Kong action and kung fu cinema , yoga , and Eastern philosophies led us to the initial inspiration for Avatar : The Last Airbender . " 
 All music and sound used in the series was done by Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn , who formed The Track Team . They experimented with use of a wide range of different instruments , the <unk> , pipa , and duduk , to compose background music . 
 The term " Avatar " comes from Sanskrit ( <unk> ) , wherein means " descent " ; its roots are <unk> , " down , " and tri , " to pass " . In the Hindu scriptures , avatar signifies the mortal incarnation of a god ( usually Vishnu ) . The Chinese characters apparent at the top of the show 's title card mean " the divine medium who has descended upon the mortal world " . According to the plot , Aang unknowingly revealed he was the Avatar when by choosing four toys out of thousands , each of which were the childhood toys of previous Avatars . In Tibetan Buddhism , there is a similar test for reincarnations of a <unk> Lama . In Magic and Mystery in Tibet , Alexandra David @-@ Neel writes that " a number of objects such as rosaries , ritualistic implements , books , tea @-@ cups , etc . , are placed together , and the child must pick out those which belonged to the late <unk> , thus showing that he recognizes the things which were theirs in their previous life " . Each successor is expected to show signs of continuity with the previous Avatar , being born within a week of the death . 
 Avatar : The Last Airbender draws on the four classical elements for its bending arts : Water , Earth , Fire , and Air . Although each has its own variation , most ancient philosophies incorporate these four elements : examples include the classical Hindu , Buddhist , and Greek elemental traditions . In the show 's opening , each element is accompanied by two Chinese characters : an ancient Chinese seal script character on the left representing the element being shown and a modern Chinese character on the right describing some feature of the element . The character 水 ( pinyin : <unk> ) , which stands for water , is shown with <unk> ( pinyin : <unk> ) , which means good and benevolent . The character 土 ( pinyin : <unk> ) , which stands for earth , is shown with <unk> ( pinyin : <unk> ) , which means strong and powerful . The character 火 ( pinyin : <unk> ) , which stands for fire , is shown with <unk> ( pinyin : <unk> ) , which means intense and fierce . Finally , the character 氣 ( pinyin : qì ) , which stands for air , is shown with <unk> ( pinyin : hé ) , which means peace / peaceful and harmony / harmonious . 
 In addition to the use of four classical elements in the series , the fighting styles associated with each element are derived from different styles of Chinese martial arts , for which the film @-@ makers employed <unk> <unk> of the Harmonious Fist Chinese Athletic Association as a consultant . Each fighting style was chosen to represent the element it projected . T 'ai chi was used for " Waterbending " in the series , which focuses on alignment , body structure , breath , and visualization . Hung Gar was used for " Earthbending " in the series , and was chosen for its firmly rooted stances and powerful strikes to present the solid nature of earth . Northern Shaolin , which uses strong arm and leg movements was used to represent " Firebending " . Ba Gua , which uses dynamic circular movements and quick directional changes , was used for " Airbending " . The only exception to these styles is Toph , who can be seen practicing a Chu Gar Southern Praying Mantis style .

 = = History = = 
 Like most of part of Borneo , this area was once under the control of the Bruneian Empire in the 15th century before been ceded to the Sultanate of Sulu between the 1600s and 1700s as a gift for helping the Bruneian forces during a civil war that happened in Brunei . The name Tawao was used on a nautical charts by 1857 , and there is evidence of a settlement by 1879 . The East India Company had establish a trading post in Borneo , though there was no significant activity by the Dutch on the east coast . In 1846 , Netherlands formed a treaty with the Sultan of Bulungan , where the latter assured the Dutch control of the area . When the Dutch began to operate in 1867 , the Sultan married his son to the daughter of the Sultan of Tarakan . Around this time , the Dutch sphere of influence reached the Tawao . They controlled the area north of Tawao , overlapping an area controlled by the Sultan of Sulu . 
 In 1878 , Sultanate of Sulu sold the southern part of his land bounded by the <unk> River to a Austro @-@ Hungarian consul Baron von Overbeck , who later tried to sell the territory to the German Empire , Austria @-@ Hungary and the Kingdom of Italy for use as a penal colony but failed , leaving Alfred Dent to manage and establishing the British North Borneo Chartered Company ( BNBC ) . The BNBC negotiated in the 1880s with the Dutch for a definition of a boundary between the area conferred by the Sultan of Sulu and the area that the Dutch claimed from Sultan of Bulungan to settle a dispute that arising from the unknown exact location of the real border between the territory that was held by the Sultanate of Sulu and the Sultanate of Bulungan . On 20 January 1891 , a final agreement was reached on a line along 4 ° 10 ' north latitude – on the central division of the Sebatik Island . In the early 1890s , approximately 200 people lived in the Tawao settlement , mostly immigrants from Bulungan in Kalimantan , and some from Tawi @-@ Tawi who had fled from Dutch and Spanish rule . The settlement was renamed from Tawao to Tawau . Most of those who fled from the Dutch colonisation continued trading with the Dutch . In 1893 , a British vessel S.S. Normanhurst sailed into Tawau with a cargo to trade . In 1898 , the British built a settlement which later grew rapidly when the BNBC sponsored the migration of Chinese to Tawau . 
 On 16 December 1941 , during World War II , the Japanese invasion of Borneo began . After the first landing in Miri , the Japanese moved along the coastline of Borneo from the oil fields of Kuching and towards Jesselton . Life in Tawau continued as usual until 24 January 1942 when the Japanese were sighted off Batu <unk> . The district officer Cole Adams and his assistant were expecting an attack at the shipyard but were instead arrested by the Japanese . The Allies began counterattacking the Japanese in mid @-@ 1944 with the bombing of Tawau . From 13 April 1945 , six massive air strikes were made on town , concentrating on the port facilities . The last and largest of these attacks was on 1 May 1945 when 19 B @-@ 24 bombers bombed Tawau until it was completely razed to the ground . After an unconditional surrender of the 37th Japanese Army under Lieutenant General Masao Baba in mid @-@ September at Labuan , 1 @,@ 100 Australian soldiers in Sandakan under the command of Lt. Col. JA England marched into the Japanese bases at Tawau . A total of 2 @,@ 900 Japanese soldiers of the 370th battalion under Major <unk> <unk> were taken as prisoners of war and transferred to Jesselton . 
 At the end of the war , the town had been largely destroyed by bombing and fire ; the Bell tower was the only intact pre @-@ war structure . Tawau quickly recovered . Though almost all the shops were destroyed , a report by The British North Borneo Annual Report in 1947 wrote that " the pre @-@ war economy was largely made towards the end of 1947 " . In the first six months post @-@ war , the British rebuilt 170 shops and commercial buildings . By 1 July 1947 , subsidies for the purchase of rice and flour were introduced . 
 = = = Indonesian confrontation = = = 
 Due to the its exposed location near the international border with Indonesia , Tawau become the main point of the conflict during the confrontation . In preparation for the impending conflict , Gurkhas were stationed in the town with other units including the " British No. 2 Special Boat Section " under Captain DW Mitchell . Australian River @-@ class destroyer escorts were stationed in Cowie Bay and a squadron of F @-@ 86 Sabre aircraft flew over Tawau daily from Labuan . 
 In October 1963 , Indonesia moved their first battalion of the Korps Komando Operasi ( <unk> ) from Surabaya to Sebatik and opened several training camps near the border in eastern Kalimantan ( now North Kalimantan ) . From 1 October to 16 December 1963 , there were at least seven shootings along the border resulting in three Indonesians deaths . On 7 December 1963 , an Indonesian Tupolev Tu @-@ 16 bomber flew over Tawau bay and bombed the town twice . 
 By mid @-@ December 1963 , Indonesian had sent a commando unit consisting of 128 volunteers and 35 regular soldiers to Sebatik . Their aim was to take Kalabakan , then invade Tawau and Sandakan . On 29 December 1963 , the Indonesian unit attacked the 3rd Royal Malay Regiment unit . The Indonesians managed to throw several grenades into the totally unprepared Malay Regiment 's sleeping quarters . The attack resulted in eight Malay soldiers killed and nineteen wounded .

 = HMS Revenge ( 1892 ) = 
 HMS Revenge was one of seven Royal Sovereign @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy during the 1890s . She spent much of her early career as a flagship for the Flying Squadron and in the Mediterranean , Home and Channel Fleets . Revenge was assigned to the International Squadron blockading Crete during the revolt there against the Ottoman Empire . She was placed in reserve upon her return home in 1900 , and was then briefly assigned as a coast guard ship before she joined the Home Fleet in 1902 . The ship became a gunnery training ship in 1906 until she was paid off in 1913 . 
 Revenge was recommissioned the following year , after the start of World War I , to bombard the coast of Flanders as part of the Dover Patrol , during which she was hit four times , but was not seriously damaged . She had anti @-@ torpedo bulges fitted in early 1915 , the first ship to be fitted with them operationally . The ship was renamed Redoubtable later that year and was refitted as an accommodation ship by the end of the year . The last surviving member of her class , the ship was sold for scrap in November 1919 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The design of the Royal Sovereign @-@ class ships was derived from that of the Admiral @-@ class ironclad battleships , greatly enlarged to improve seakeeping and to provide space for a secondary armament as in the preceding Trafalgar @-@ class ironclad battleships . The ships displaced 14 @,@ 150 long tons ( 14 @,@ 380 t ) at normal load and 15 @,@ 580 long tons ( 15 @,@ 830 t ) at deep load . They had a length between perpendiculars of 380 feet ( 115 @.@ 8 m ) and an overall length of 410 feet 6 inches ( 125 @.@ 1 m ) , a beam of 75 feet ( 22 @.@ 9 m ) , and a draught of 27 feet 6 inches ( 8 @.@ 4 m ) . As a flagship , Revenge 's crew consisted of 695 officers and ratings in 1903 . 
 The Royal Sovereigns were powered by a pair of three @-@ cylinder , vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one shaft . Their Humphrys & Tennant engines were designed to produce a total of 11 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 8 @,@ 200 kW ) and a maximum speed of 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ; 20 @.@ 1 mph ) using steam provided by eight cylindrical boilers with forced draught . The ships carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 420 long tons ( 1 @,@ 443 t ) of coal which gave them a range of 4 @,@ 720 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 740 km ; 5 @,@ 430 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Their main armament consisted of four breech @-@ loading ( BL ) 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 343 mm ) guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun barbettes , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . Each gun was provided with 80 rounds . Their secondary armament consisted of ten quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns . 200 rounds per gun were carried by the ships . Sixteen QF 6 @-@ pounder ( 2 @.@ 2 in ( 57 mm ) ) and a dozen QF 3 @-@ pounder ( 1 @.@ 9 in ( 47 mm ) ) Hotchkiss guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats . The two 3 @-@ pounders in the upper fighting top were removed in 1903 – 04 , and all of the remaining light guns from the lower fighting tops and main deck followed in 1905 – 09 . The Royal Sovereign @-@ class ships mounted seven 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedo tubes , although Revenge had four of hers removed in 1902 . 
 The Royal Sovereigns ' armour scheme was similar to that of the Trafalgars , as the waterline belt of compound armour only protected the area between the barbettes . The 14 – 18 @-@ inch ( 356 – 457 mm ) belt and transverse bulkheads 14 – 16 inches ( 356 – 406 mm ) thick closed off the ends of the belt . Above the belt was a strake of 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) nickel @-@ steel armour closed off by 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) transverse bulkheads . 
 The barbettes were protected by compound armour , ranging in thickness from 11 to 17 inches ( 279 to 432 mm ) and the casemates for the 6 @-@ inch guns had a thickness equal to their diameter . The thicknesses of the armour deck ranged from 2 @.@ 5 to 3 inches ( 64 to 76 mm ) . The walls of the forward conning tower were 12 – 14 inches ( 305 – 356 mm ) thick and the aft conning tower was protected by 3 @-@ inch plates . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Revenge was the ninth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy and was ordered under the Naval Defence Act Programme of 1889 . The ship was laid down by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at their shipyard in Jarrow in Tyne and Wear , England , on 12 February 1891 . She was floated out of the drydock on 3 November 1892 , and completed on 22 March 1894 at a cost of £ 954 @,@ 825 . Upon completion , Revenge was placed in reserve at Portsmouth . Almost two years later , she mobilised there on 14 January 1896 as flagship of the Particular Service Squadron , soon renamed the Flying Squadron , which was formed in response to rising tensions in Europe following the Jameson Raid and Germany 's Kaiser Wilhelm II 's telegram of support to the Boer government . The squadron was briefly attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in the middle of the year . When it was disbanded on 5 November , Revenge relieved the battleship Trafalgar as the flagship of the second @-@ in @-@ command of the Mediterranean Fleet . 
 From February 1897 to December 1898 , Revenge served in the International Squadron blockading Crete during the uprising there that led to the establishment of the Cretan State . During this time , she landed a force of Royal Marines on Crete to seize Fort <unk> , and , in September 1898 , she went to Candia to support the British garrison there after it had been attacked by rebels . Sometime in 1899 , she had a cordite explosion in one of her six @-@ inch magazines due to spontaneous combustion , but the damage was not very severe because only three cartridges detonated . In April 1900 , the battleship Victorious replaced her and she returned home , paying off into Fleet Reserve at Chatham Dockyard . During this time the ship had a wireless telegraph installed . On 18 April 1901 , Revenge was recommissioned at Chatham by Captain Frederic Fisher to relieve Alexandra as both the coast guard ship at Portland and the flagship of Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Gerard Noel , Admiral Superintendent of Naval Reserves . In March 1902 , she arrived at Portsmouth for a refit that included the provision of casemates for her upper @-@ deck six @-@ inch guns , and her crew was temporarily transferred to the elderly ironclad Hercules which also took on her duties at Portland . Captain Fisher and his crew were back on board in early June , following gun trials after the repairs . After the refit , she commissioned in October 1902 to serve as flagship of the Home Squadron upon its creation . 
 In April 1904 , Revenge and her sister ship Royal Oak both struck a submerged wreck off the Scilly Isles while serving with the Home Fleet , damaging their bottoms . In July 1905 , the ship participated in maneuvers with the Reserve Fleet and was then transferred to the Portsmouth Reserve Division on 1 September . In June 1906 , she relieved the battleship Colossus as the gunnery training ship at Portsmouth and was assigned to the gunnery school HMS Excellent . On 13 June 1908 , Revenge was struck by the merchant ship SS <unk> Head when the latter was cut loose by her tugboat during a sudden squall in Portsmouth Harbour . In October 1909 , she conducted gunnery tests on the obsolete battleship Edinburgh to evaluate the effects of shells against varying thicknesses of armour . On 7 January 1912 , the ship was badly damaged when , during a gale at Portsmouth , she broke loose from her moorings and drifted onto the bow of the dreadnought Orion . Later that year , her guns were relined down to 10 inches ( 250 mm ) for testing and the liners were removed in October . Revenge was relieved as a gunnery training ship by the battleship Albemarle and paid off on 15 May 1913 . She was laid up at Motherbank , awaiting disposal . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Revenge was given a reprieve from the scrapyard by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 . The Admiralty decided to bring her back into service for use in coastal bombardment duties off the coast of Flanders . In September – October , she was refitted at Portsmouth for this mission , which included <unk> her 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns down to 12 inches ( 305 mm ) , improving their range by about one thousand yards ( 910 m ) . Her refit completed , she was ordered on 31 October 1914 to stand by to relieve the battleship Venerable as flagship of the Dover Patrol . Revenge was declared ready for service on 5 November , and was assigned to the Channel Fleet 's new 6th Battle Squadron with the battleships Albemarle , Cornwallis , Duncan , Exmouth and Russell . Plans for the squadron to participate in an attack on German submarine bases were cancelled due to bad weather on 14 November , and instead Revenge and the battleship Majestic departed Dover , England , for Dunkirk , France . 
 Revenge participated in her first action of the war when she joined the gunboat Bustard , six British and four French destroyers , and a French torpedo boat in bombarding German troops from off Nieuwpoort , Belgium , on 22 November . On 15 – 16 December , Revenge bombarded German heavy artillery batteries , during which time she received two 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) shell hits , one of which penetrated her hull below the waterline and caused her to be withdrawn for repairs . In early 1915 , the ship participated in experiments using aircraft to observe and control her gunfire , but these were only partially successful . In April – May she underwent a refit at Chatham Dockyard in which she had anti @-@ torpedo bulges fitted . Afterwards , Revenge conducted trials using sea @-@ based observers on off @-@ shore platforms to direct the bombardment . On 2 August , she was renamed Redoubtable . 
 On 7 September , she returned to combat , joining the gunboats Bustard and Excellent in bombarding German barracks and gun positions at Westende , inflicting much damage on the Germans . One of her anti @-@ torpedo bulges was deliberately flooded to give her a list that would increase the range of her guns . The ship was hit by a pair of six @-@ inch shells during the action . Redoubtable underwent another refit from October to December 1915 . Afterwards , she was not recommissioned , instead serving as an accommodation ship at Portsmouth until February 1919 . She was sold to Thomas W. Ward Ltd for £ 42 @,@ 750 on 6 November 1919 , and subsequently broken up at Swansea and Briton Ferry .

 = Charlie Chaplin = 
 Sir Charles Spencer " Charlie " Chaplin , KBE ( 16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977 ) was an English comic actor , filmmaker , and composer who rose to fame in the silent era . Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona " the Tramp " and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry . His career spanned more than 75 years , from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977 , and encompassed both adulation and controversy . 
 Chaplin 's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship . As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially , he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine . When he was 14 , his mother was committed to a mental asylum . Chaplin began performing at an early age , touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian . At 19 he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company , which took him to America . Chaplin was scouted for the film industry , and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios . He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base . Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage , and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay , Mutual , and First National corporations . By 1918 , he was one of the best known figures in the world . 
 In 1919 , Chaplin co @-@ founded the distribution company United Artists , which gave him complete control over his films . His first feature @-@ length was The Kid ( 1921 ) , followed by A Woman of Paris ( 1923 ) , The Gold Rush ( 1925 ) , and The Circus ( 1928 ) . He refused to move to sound films in the 1930s , instead producing City Lights ( 1931 ) and Modern Times ( 1936 ) without dialogue . Chaplin became increasingly political , and his next film , The Great Dictator ( 1940 ) , satirised Adolf Hitler . The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin , and his popularity declined rapidly . He was accused of communist sympathies , while his involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women caused scandal . An FBI investigation was opened , and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland . He abandoned the Tramp in his later films , which include Monsieur Verdoux ( 1947 ) , Limelight ( 1952 ) , A King in New York ( 1957 ) , and A Countess from Hong Kong ( 1967 ) . 
 Chaplin wrote , directed , produced , edited , starred in , and composed the music for most of his films . He was a perfectionist , and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture . His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos , typified in the Tramp 's struggles against adversity . Many contain social and political themes , as well as autobiographical elements . In 1972 , as part of a renewed appreciation for his work , Chaplin received an Honorary Academy Award for " the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century " . He continues to be held in high regard , with The Gold Rush , City Lights , Modern Times , and The Great Dictator often ranked on industry lists of the greatest films of all time .

 Charles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin ( born Hannah Harriet <unk> Hill ) and Charles Chaplin Sr. There is no official record of his birth , although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street , Walworth , in South London . His mother and father had married four years previously , at which time Charles Sr. became the legal carer of Hannah 's illegitimate son , Sydney John Hill . At the time of his birth , Chaplin 's parents were both music hall entertainers . Hannah , the daughter of a shoemaker , had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley , while Charles Sr. , a butcher 's son , was a popular singer . Although they never divorced , Chaplin 's parents were estranged by around 1891 . The following year , Hannah gave birth to a third son – George Wheeler Dryden – fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden . The child was taken by Dryden at six months old , and did not re @-@ enter Chaplin 's life for 30 years . 
 Chaplin 's childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship , making his eventual trajectory " the most dramatic of all the rags to riches stories ever told " according to his authorised biographer David Robinson . Chaplin 's early years were spent with his mother and brother Sydney in the London district of Kennington ; Hannah had no means of income , other than occasional nursing and dressmaking , and Chaplin Sr. provided no financial support . As the situation deteriorated , Chaplin was sent to a workhouse when he was seven years old . The council housed him at the Central London District School for paupers , which Chaplin remembered as " a forlorn existence " . He was briefly reunited with his mother 18 months later , before Hannah was forced to readmit her family to the workhouse in July 1898 . The boys were promptly sent to Norwood Schools , another institution for destitute children . 
 In September 1898 , Hannah was committed to Cane Hill mental asylum – she had developed a psychosis seemingly brought on by an infection of syphilis and malnutrition . For the two months she was there , Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent to live with their father , whom the young boys scarcely knew . Charles Sr. was by then a severe alcoholic , and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children . Chaplin 's father died two years later , at 38 years old , from cirrhosis of the liver . 
 Hannah entered a period of remission , but in May 1903 became ill again . Chaplin , then 14 , had the task of taking his mother to the infirmary , from where she was sent back to Cane Hill . He lived alone for several days , searching for food and occasionally sleeping rough , until Sydney – who had enrolled in the Navy two years earlier – returned . Hannah was released from the asylum eight months later , but in March 1905 her illness returned , this time permanently . " There was nothing we could do but accept poor mother 's fate " , Chaplin later wrote , and she remained in care until her death in 1928 .

 Between his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness , Chaplin began to perform on stage . He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years , when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot . This was an isolated occurrence , but by the time he was nine Chaplin had , with his mother 's encouragement , grown interested in performing . He later wrote : " [ she ] imbued me with the feeling that I had some sort of talent " . Through his father 's connections , Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog @-@ dancing troupe , with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900 . Chaplin worked hard , and the act was popular with audiences , but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act . 
 In the years Chaplin was touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads , his mother ensured that he still attended school , but by age 13 he had abandoned education . He supported himself with a range of jobs , while nursing his ambition to become an actor . At 14 , shortly after his mother 's relapse , he registered with a theatrical agency in London 's West End . The manager sensed potential in Chaplin , who was promptly given his first role as a newsboy in H. A. Saintsbury 's Jim , a Romance of Cockayne . It opened in July 1903 , but the show was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks . Chaplin 's comic performance , however , was singled out for praise in many of the reviews . 
 Saintsbury secured a role for Chaplin in Charles Frohman 's production of Sherlock Holmes , where he played Billy the pageboy in three nationwide tours . His performance was so well received that he was called to London to play the role alongside William Gillette , the original Holmes . " It was like tidings from heaven " , Chaplin recalled . At 16 years old , Chaplin starred in the play 's West End production at the Duke of York 's Theatre from October to December 1905 . He completed one final tour of Sherlock Holmes in early 1906 , before leaving the play after more than two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years . 
 = = = = Stage comedy and vaudeville = = = = 
 Chaplin soon found work with a new company , and went on tour with his brother – who was also pursuing an acting career – in a comedy sketch called Repairs . In May 1906 , Chaplin joined the juvenile act Casey 's Circus , where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon the star of the show . By the time the act finished touring in July 1907 , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had become an accomplished comedic performer . He struggled to find more work , however , and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure . 
 Meanwhile , Sydney Chaplin had joined Fred Karno 's prestigious comedy company in 1906 , and by 1908 he was one of their key performers . In February , he managed to secure a two @-@ week trial for his younger brother . Karno was initially wary , and considered Chaplin a " pale , puny , sullen @-@ looking youngster " who " looked much too shy to do any good in the theatre . " But the teenager made an impact on his first night at the London Coliseum and he was quickly signed to a contract . Chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts , eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909 . In April 1910 , he was given the lead in a new sketch , Jimmy the Fearless . It was a big success , and Chaplin received considerable press attention . 
 Karno selected his new star to join the section of the company that toured North America 's vaudeville circuit . The young comedian headed the show and impressed reviewers , being described as " one of the best pantomime artists ever seen here " . His most successful role was a drunk called the " Inebriate Swell " , which drew him significant recognition . The tour lasted 21 months , and the troupe returned to England in June 1912 . Chaplin recalled that he " had a disquieting feeling of sinking back into a depressing <unk> " , and was therefore delighted when a new tour began in October .

 = = = = Keystone = = = = 
 Six months into the second American tour , Chaplin was invited to join the New York Motion Picture Company . A representative who had seen his performances thought he could replace Fred Mace , a star of their Keystone Studios who intended to leave . Chaplin thought the Keystone comedies " a crude mélange of rough and rumble " , but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised : " Besides , it would mean a new life . " He met with the company , and signed a $ 150 @-@ per @-@ week ( $ 3 @,@ 591 in 2016 dollars ) contract in September 1913 . 
 Chaplin arrived in Los Angeles , home of the Keystone studio , in early December 1913 . His boss was Mack Sennett , who initially expressed concern that the 24 @-@ year @-@ old looked too young . He was not used in a picture until late January , during which time Chaplin attempted to learn the processes of filmmaking . The one @-@ reeler Making a Living marked his film acting debut , and was released on 2 February 1914 . Chaplin strongly disliked the picture , but one review picked him out as " a comedian of the first water " . For his second appearance in front of the camera , Chaplin selected the costume with which he became identified . He described the process in his autobiography : 
 " I wanted everything to be a contradiction : the pants baggy , the coat tight , the hat small and the shoes large ... I added a small moustache , which , I reasoned , would add age without hiding my expression . I had no idea of the character . But the moment I was dressed , the clothes and the makeup made me feel the person he was . I began to know him , and by the time I walked on stage he was fully born . " 
 The film was Mabel 's Strange Predicament , but " the Tramp " character , as it became known , debuted to audiences in Kid Auto Races at Venice – shot later than Mabel 's Strange Predicament but released two days earlier . Chaplin adopted the character as his screen persona , and attempted to make suggestions for the films he appeared in . These ideas were dismissed by his directors . During the filming of his eleventh picture , Mabel at the Wheel , he clashed with director Mabel Normand and was almost released from his contract . Sennett kept him on , however , when he received orders from exhibitors for more Chaplin films . Sennett also allowed Chaplin to direct his next film himself , after Chaplin promised to pay $ 1 @,@ 500 ( $ 35 @,@ 914 in 2016 dollars ) if the film was unsuccessful . 
 Caught in the Rain , issued 4 May 1914 , was Chaplin 's directorial debut and was highly successful . Thereafter he directed almost every short film in which he appeared for Keystone , at the rate of approximately one per week , a period which he later remembered as the most exciting time of his career . Chaplin 's films introduced a slower form of comedy than the typical Keystone farce , and he developed a large fan base . In November 1914 , he had a supporting role in the first feature length comedy film , Tillie 's <unk> Romance , directed by Sennett and starring Marie Dressler , which was a commercial success and increased his popularity . When Chaplin 's contract came up for renewal at the end of the year , he asked for $ 1 @,@ 000 a week ( $ 23 @,@ 943 in 2016 dollars ) – an amount Sennett refused as too large . 
 = = = = Essanay = = = = 
 The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company of Chicago sent Chaplin an offer of $ 1 @,@ 250 a week with a signing bonus of $ 10 @,@ 000 . He joined the studio in late December 1914 , where he began forming a stock company of regular players , including Leo White , Bud Jamison , Paddy McGuire and Billy Armstrong . He soon recruited a leading lady – Edna Purviance , whom Chaplin met in a cafe and hired on account of her beauty . She went on to appear in 35 films with Chaplin over eight years ; the pair also formed a romantic relationship that lasted into 1917 . 
 Chaplin asserted a high level of control over his pictures , and started to put more time and care into each film . There was a month @-@ long interval between the release of his second production , A Night Out , and his third , The Champion . The final seven of Chaplin 's 14 Essanay films were all produced at this slower pace . Chaplin also began to alter his screen persona , which had attracted some criticism at Keystone for its " mean , crude , and brutish " nature . The character became more gentle and romantic ; The Tramp ( April 1915 ) was considered a particular turning point in his development . The use of pathos was developed further with The Bank , in which Chaplin created a sad ending . Robinson notes that this was an innovation in comedy films , and marked the time when serious critics began to appreciate Chaplin 's work . At Essanay , writes film scholar Simon Louvish , Chaplin " found the themes and the settings that would define the Tramp 's world . " 
 During 1915 , Chaplin became a cultural phenomenon . Shops were stocked with Chaplin merchandise , he was featured in cartoons and comic strips , and several songs were written about him . In July , a journalist for Motion Picture Magazine wrote that " <unk> " had spread across America . As his fame grew worldwide , he became the film industry 's first international star . When the Essanay contract ended in December 1915 , Chaplin – fully aware of his popularity – requested a $ 150 @,@ 000 signing bonus from his next studio . He received several offers , including Universal , Fox , and Vitagraph , the best of which came from the Mutual Film Corporation at $ 10 @,@ 000 a week . 
 = = = = Mutual = = = = 
 A contract was negotiated with Mutual that amounted to $ 670 @,@ 000 a year , which Robinson says made Chaplin – at 26 years old – one of the highest paid people in the world . The high salary shocked the public and was widely reported in the press . John R. Freuler , the studio president , explained : " We can afford to pay Mr. Chaplin this large sum annually because the public wants Chaplin and will pay for him . " 
 Mutual gave Chaplin his own Los Angeles studio to work in , which opened in March 1916 . He added two key members to his stock company , Albert Austin and Eric Campbell , and produced a series of elaborate two @-@ reelers : The <unk> , The Fireman , The Vagabond , One A.M. and The Count . For The Pawnshop he recruited the actor Henry Bergman , who was to work with Chaplin for 30 years . Behind the Screen and The Rink completed Chaplin 's releases for 1916 . The Mutual contract stipulated that he release a two @-@ reel film every four weeks , which he had managed to achieve . With the new year , however , Chaplin began to demand more time . He made only four more films for Mutual over the first ten months of 1917 : Easy Street , The Cure , The Immigrant and The Adventurer . With their careful construction , these films are considered by Chaplin scholars to be among his finest work . Later in life , Chaplin referred to his Mutual years as the happiest period of his career . 
 Chaplin was attacked in the British media for not fighting in the First World War . He defended himself , revealing that he would fight for Britain if called and had registered for the American draft , but he was not summoned by either country . Despite this criticism Chaplin was a favourite with the troops , and his popularity continued to grow worldwide . Harper 's Weekly reported that the name of Charlie Chaplin was " a part of the common language of almost every country " , and that the Tramp image was " universally familiar " . In 1917 , professional Chaplin imitators were so widespread that he took legal action , and it was reported that nine out of ten men who attended costume parties dressed as the Tramp . The same year , a study by the Boston Society for Psychical Research concluded that Chaplin was " an American obsession " . The actress Minnie <unk> Fiske wrote that " a constantly increasing body of cultured , artistic people are beginning to regard the young English buffoon , Charles Chaplin , as an extraordinary artist , as well as a comic genius " . 
 = = = First National ( 1918 – 1922 ) = = = 
 Mutual were patient with Chaplin 's decreased rate of output , and the contract ended amicably . His primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence ; Sydney Chaplin , then his business manager , told the press , " Charlie [ must ] be allowed all the time he needs and all the money for producing [ films ] the way he wants ... It is quality , not quantity , we are after . " In June 1917 , Chaplin signed to complete eight films for First National Exhibitors ' Circuit in return for $ 1 million . He chose to build his own studio , situated on five acres of land off Sunset Boulevard , with production facilities of the highest order . It was completed in January 1918 , and Chaplin was given freedom over the making of his pictures . 
 A Dog 's Life , released April 1918 , was the first film under the new contract . In it , Chaplin demonstrated his increasing concern with story construction , and his treatment of the Tramp as " a sort of Pierrot " . The film was described by Louis Delluc as " cinema 's first total work of art " . Chaplin then embarked on the Third Liberty Bond campaign , touring the United States for one month to raise money for the Allies of the First World War . He also produced a short propaganda film , donated to the government for fund @-@ raising , called The Bond . Chaplin 's next release was war @-@ based , placing the Tramp in the trenches for Shoulder Arms . Associates warned him against making a comedy about the war but , as he later recalled : " Dangerous or not , the idea excited me . " He spent four months filming the 45 @-@ minute @-@ long picture , which was released in October 1918 with great success . 
 = = = = United Artists , Mildred Harris , and The Kid = = = = 
 After the release of Shoulder Arms , Chaplin requested more money from First National , which was refused . Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality , and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players @-@ Lasky , Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks , Mary Pickford , and D. W. Griffith to form a new distribution company – United Artists , established in January 1919 . The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry , as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control . Chaplin was eager to start with the new company , and offered to buy out his contract with First National . They declined this , and insisted that he complete the final six films he owed them . 
 Before the creation of United Artists , Chaplin married for the first time . The 17 @-@ year @-@ old actress Mildred Harris had revealed that she was pregnant with his child , and in September 1918 he married her quietly in Los Angeles to avoid controversy . Soon after , the pregnancy was found to be a false alarm . Chaplin was unhappy with the union and , feeling that marriage stunted his creativity , struggled over the production of his film Sunnyside . Harris was by then legitimately pregnant , and on 7 July 1919 , gave birth to a son . Norman Spencer Chaplin was born malformed , and died three days later . The marriage eventually ended in April 1920 , with Chaplin explaining in his autobiography that they were " <unk> <unk> " . 
 Losing a child is thought to have influenced Chaplin 's work , as he planned a film which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy . For this new venture , Chaplin also wished to do more than comedy and , according to Louvish , " make his mark on a changed world . " Filming on The Kid began in August 1919 , with four @-@ year @-@ old Jackie Coogan his co @-@ star . It occurred to Chaplin that it was turning into a large project , so to placate First National , he halted production and quickly filmed A Day 's Pleasure . The Kid was in production for nine months , until May 1920 , and at 68 minutes it was Chaplin 's longest picture to date . Dealing with issues of poverty and parent – child separation , The Kid is thought to have been influenced by Chaplin 's own childhood and was one of the earliest films to combine comedy and drama . It was released in January 1921 with instant success , and by 1924 had been screened in over 50 countries . 
 Chaplin spent five months on his next film , the two @-@ reeler The Idle Class . Following its September 1921 release , he chose to return to England for the first time in almost a decade . He then worked to fulfil his First National contract , releasing Pay Day in February 1922 . The Pilgrim – his final short film – was delayed by distribution disagreements with the studio , and released a year later .

 = = = = A Woman of Paris and The Gold Rush = = = = 
 Having fulfilled his First National contract , Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer . In November 1922 he began filming A Woman of Paris , a romantic drama about ill @-@ fated lovers . Chaplin intended it to be a star @-@ making vehicle for Edna Purviance , and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief , uncredited cameo . He wished for the film to have a realistic feel , and directed his cast to give restrained performances . In real life , he explained , " men and women try to hide their emotions rather than seek to express them " . A Woman of Paris premiered in September 1923 and was acclaimed for its subtle approach , then an innovation . The public , however , seemed to have little interest in a Chaplin film without his presence , and it was a box @-@ office disappointment . The filmmaker was hurt by this failure – he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result – and withdrew A Woman of Paris from circulation as soon as he could . 
 Chaplin returned to comedy for his next project . Setting his standards high , he told himself : " This next film must be an epic ! The Greatest ! " Inspired by a photograph of the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush , and later the story of the Donner Party of 1846 – 47 , he made what Geoffrey Macnab calls " an epic comedy out of grim subject matter . " In The Gold Rush , the Tramp is a lonely prospector fighting adversity and looking for love . With Georgia Hale as his new leading lady , Chaplin began filming the picture in February 1924 . Its elaborate production , costing almost $ 1 million , included location shooting in the Truckee mountains with 600 extras , extravagant sets , and special effects . The last scene was not shot until May 1925 , after 15 months of filming . 
 Chaplin felt The Gold Rush was the best film he had made to that point . It opened in August 1925 and became one of the highest @-@ grossing films of the silent era with a profit of $ 5 million . The comedy contains some of Chaplin 's most famous sequences , such as the Tramp eating his shoe and the " Dance of the Rolls " . Macnab has called it " the quintessential Chaplin film " . Chaplin stated , " This is the picture that I want to be remembered by " at the time of the film 's release . 
 = = = = Lita Grey and The Circus = = = = 
 While making The Gold Rush , Chaplin married for the second time . Mirroring the circumstances of his first union , Lita Grey was a teenage actress , originally set to star in the film , whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage . She was 16 and he was 35 , meaning Chaplin could have been charged with statutory rape under California law . He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924 . Their first son , Charles Spencer Chaplin , Jr . , was born on 5 May 1925 , followed by Sydney Earl Chaplin on 30 March 1926 . 
 It was an unhappy marriage , and Chaplin spent long hours at the studio to avoid seeing his wife . In November 1926 , Grey took the children and left the family home . A bitter divorce followed , in which Grey 's application – accusing Chaplin of infidelity , abuse , and of harbouring " perverted sexual desires " – was leaked to the press . Chaplin was reported to be in a state of nervous breakdown , as the story became headline news and groups formed across America calling for his films to be banned . Eager to end the case without further scandal , Chaplin 's lawyers agreed to a cash settlement of $ 600 @,@ 000 – the largest awarded by American courts at that time . His fan base was strong enough to survive the incident , and it was soon forgotten , but Chaplin was deeply affected by it . 
 Before the divorce suit was filed , Chaplin had begun work on a new film , The Circus . He built a story around the idea of walking a tightrope while besieged by monkeys , and turned the Tramp into the accidental star of a circus . Filming was suspended for 10 months while he dealt with the divorce scandal , and it was generally a trouble @-@ ridden production . Finally completed in October 1927 , The Circus was released in January 1928 to a positive reception . At the 1st Academy Awards , Chaplin was given a special trophy " For versatility and genius in acting , writing , directing and producing The Circus . Despite its success , he permanently associated the film with the stress of its production ; Chaplin omitted The Circus from his autobiography , and struggled to work on it when he recorded the score in his later years . 
 = = = = City Lights = = = = 
 By the time The Circus was released , Hollywood had witnessed the introduction of sound films . Chaplin was cynical about this new medium and the technical shortcomings it presented , believing that " talkies " lacked the artistry of silent films . He was also hesitant to change the formula that had brought him such success , and feared that giving the Tramp a voice would limit his international appeal . He therefore rejected the new Hollywood craze and began work on a new silent film . Chaplin was nonetheless anxious about this decision , and remained so throughout the film 's production . 
 When filming began at the end of 1928 , Chaplin had been working on the story for almost a year . City Lights followed the Tramp 's love for a blind flower girl ( played by Virginia Cherrill ) and his efforts to raise money for her sight @-@ saving operation . It was a challenging production that lasted 21 months , with Chaplin later confessing that he " had worked himself into a neurotic state of wanting perfection " . One advantage Chaplin found in sound technology was the opportunity to record a musical score for the film , which he composed himself . 
 Chaplin finished editing City Lights in December 1930 , by which time silent films were an anachronism . A preview before an unsuspecting public audience was not a success , but a showing for the press produced positive reviews . One journalist wrote , " Nobody in the world but Charlie Chaplin could have done it . He is the only person that has that peculiar something called ' audience appeal ' in sufficient quality to defy the popular penchant for movies that talk . " Given its general release in January 1931 , City Lights proved to be a popular and financial success – eventually grossing over $ 3 million . The British Film Institute cites it as Chaplin 's finest accomplishment , and the critic James Agee hails the closing scene as " the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies " . City Lights became Chaplin 's personal favourite of his films and remained so throughout his life . 
 = = = = Travels , Paulette Goddard , and Modern Times = = = = 
 City Lights had been a success , but Chaplin was unsure if he could make another picture without dialogue . He remained convinced that sound would not work in his films , but was also " obsessed by a depressing fear of being old @-@ fashioned . " In this state of uncertainty , early in 1931 the comedian decided to take a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months . In his autobiography , Chaplin recalled that on his return to Los Angeles , " I was confused and without plan , restless and conscious of an extreme loneliness " . He briefly considered the option of retiring and moving to China . 
 Chaplin 's loneliness was relieved when he met 21 @-@ year @-@ old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932 , and the pair began a successful relationship . He was not ready to commit to a film , however , and focussed on writing a serial about his travels ( published in Woman 's Home Companion ) . The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin , including meetings with several prominent thinkers , and he became increasingly interested in world affairs . The state of labour in America troubled him , and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels . It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film . 
 Modern Times was announced by Chaplin as " a satire on certain phases of our industrial life . " Featuring the Tramp and Goddard as they endure the Great Depression , it took ten and a half months to film . Chaplin intended to use spoken dialogue , but changed his mind during rehearsals . Like its predecessor , Modern Times employed sound effects , but almost no speaking . Chaplin 's performance of a gibberish song did , however , give the Tramp a voice for the only time on film . After recording the music , Chaplin released Modern Times in February 1936 . It was his first feature in 15 years to adopt political references and social realism , a factor that attracted considerable press coverage despite Chaplin 's attempts to downplay the issue . The film earned less at the box @-@ office than his previous features and received mixed reviews , as some viewers disliked the politicising . Today , Modern Times is seen by the British Film Institute as one of Chaplin 's " great features , " while David Robinson says it shows the filmmaker at " his unrivalled peak as a creator of visual comedy . " 
 Following the release of Modern Times , Chaplin left with Goddard for a trip to the Far East . The couple had refused to comment on the nature of their relationship , and it was not known whether they were married or not . Some time later , Chaplin revealed that they married in Canton during this trip . By 1938 the couple had drifted apart , as both focused heavily on their work , although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film , The Great Dictator . She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942 , citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year . 
 = = = Controversies and fading popularity ( 1939 – 1952 ) = = = 
 = = = = The Great Dictator = = = = 
 The 1940s saw Chaplin face a series of controversies , both in his work and in his personal life , which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in the United States . The first of these was a new boldness in expressing his political beliefs . Deeply disturbed by the surge of militaristic nationalism in 1930s world politics , Chaplin found that he could not keep these issues out of his work . Parallels between himself and Adolf Hitler had been widely noted : the pair were born four days apart , both had risen from poverty to world prominence , and Hitler wore the same toothbrush moustache as Chaplin . It was this physical resemblance that supplied the plot for Chaplin 's next film , The Great Dictator , which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism . 
 Chaplin spent two years developing the script , and began filming in September 1939 – six days after Britain declared war on Germany . He had submitted to using spoken dialogue , partly out of acceptance that he had no other choice , but also because he recognised it as a better method for delivering a political message . Making a comedy about Hitler was seen as highly controversial , but Chaplin 's financial independence allowed him to take the risk . " I was determined to go ahead , " he later wrote , " for Hitler must be laughed at . " Chaplin replaced the Tramp ( while wearing similar attire ) with " A Jewish Barber " , a reference to the Nazi party 's belief that he was Jewish . In a dual performance he also played the dictator " <unk> <unk> " , who parodied Hitler . 
 The Great Dictator spent a year in production , and was released in October 1940 . The film generated a vast amount of publicity , with a critic for The New York Times calling it " the most eagerly awaited picture of the year " , and it was one of the biggest money @-@ makers of the era . The ending was unpopular , however , and generated controversy . Chaplin concluded the film with a five @-@ minute speech in which he abandoned his barber character , looked directly into the camera , and pleaded against war and fascism . Charles J. Maland has identified this overt preaching as triggering a decline in Chaplin 's popularity , and writes , " Henceforth , no movie fan would ever be able to separate the dimension of politics from [ his ] star image " . The Great Dictator received five Academy Award nominations , including Best Picture , Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor . 
 = = = = Legal troubles and Oona O 'Neill = = = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1940s , Chaplin was involved in a series of trials that occupied most of his time and significantly affected his public image . The troubles stemmed from his affair with an aspirant actress named Joan Barry , with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942 . Barry , who displayed obsessive behaviour and was twice arrested after they separated , reappeared the following year and announced that she was pregnant with Chaplin 's child . As Chaplin denied the claim , Barry filed a paternity suit against him . 
 The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , J. Edgar Hoover , who had long been suspicious of Chaplin 's political leanings , used the opportunity to generate negative publicity about him . As part of a smear campaign to damage Chaplin 's image , the FBI named him in four indictments related to the Barry case . Most serious of these was an alleged violation of the Mann Act , which prohibits the transportation of women across state boundaries for sexual purposes . The historian Otto Friedrich has called this an " absurd prosecution " of an " ancient statute " , yet if Chaplin was found guilty , he faced 23 years in jail . Three charges lacked sufficient evidence to proceed to court , but the Mann Act trial began in March 1944 . Chaplin was acquitted two weeks later . The case was frequently headline news , with Newsweek calling it the " biggest public relations scandal since the Fatty Arbuckle murder trial in 1921 . " 
 Barry 's child , Carole Ann , was born in October 1944 , and the paternity suit went to court in February 1945 . After two arduous trials , in which the prosecuting lawyer accused him of " moral turpitude " , Chaplin was declared to be the father . Evidence from blood tests which indicated otherwise were not admissible , and the judge ordered Chaplin to pay child support until Carole Ann turned 21 . Media coverage of the paternity suit was influenced by the FBI , as information was fed to the prominent gossip columnist Hedda Hopper , and Chaplin was portrayed in an overwhelmingly critical light . 
 The controversy surrounding Chaplin increased when , two weeks after the paternity suit was filed , it was announced that he had married his newest protégée , 18 @-@ year @-@ old Oona O 'Neill – daughter of the American playwright Eugene O 'Neill . Chaplin , then 54 , had been introduced to her by a film agent seven months earlier . In his autobiography , Chaplin described meeting O 'Neill as " the happiest event of my life " , and claimed to have found " perfect love " . Chaplin 's son , Charles Jr . , reported that Oona " worshipped " his father . The couple remained married until Chaplin 's death , and had eight children over 18 years : Geraldine Leigh ( b . July 1944 ) , Michael John ( b . March 1946 ) , Josephine Hannah ( b . March 1949 ) , Victoria ( b . May 1951 ) , Eugene Anthony ( b . August 1953 ) , Jane Cecil ( b . May 1957 ) , Annette Emily ( b . December 1959 ) , and Christopher James ( b . July 1962 ) . 
 = = = = Monsieur Verdoux and communist accusations = = = = 
 Chaplin claimed that the Barry trials had " crippled [ his ] creativeness " , and it was some time before he began working again . In April 1946 , he finally began filming a project that had been in development since 1942 . Monsieur Verdoux was a black comedy , the story of a French bank clerk , Verdoux ( Chaplin ) , who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family . Chaplin 's inspiration for the project came from Orson Welles , who wanted him to star in a film about the French serial killer Henri Désiré <unk> . Chaplin decided that the concept would " make a wonderful comedy " , and paid Welles $ 5 @,@ 000 for the idea . 
 Chaplin again vocalised his political views in Monsieur Verdoux , criticising capitalism and arguing that the world encourages mass killing through wars and weapons of mass destruction . Because of this , the film met with controversy when it was released in April 1947 ; Chaplin was booed at the premiere , and there were calls for a boycott . Monsieur Verdoux was the first Chaplin release that failed both critically and commercially in the United States . It was more successful abroad , and Chaplin 's screenplay was nominated at the Academy Awards . He was proud of the film , writing in his autobiography , " Monsieur Verdoux is the cleverest and most brilliant film I have yet made . " 
 The negative reaction to Monsieur Verdoux was largely the result of changes in Chaplin 's public image . Along with damage of the Joan Barry scandal , he was publicly accused of being a communist . His political activity had heightened during World War II , when he campaigned for the opening of a Second Front to help the Soviet Union and supported various Soviet – American friendship groups . He was also friendly with several suspected communists , and attended functions given by Soviet diplomats in Los Angeles . In the political climate of 1940s America , such activities meant Chaplin was considered , as Larcher writes , " dangerously progressive and amoral . " The FBI wanted him out of the country , and early in 1947 they launched an official investigation . 
 Chaplin denied being a communist , instead calling himself a " <unk> " , but felt the government 's effort to suppress the ideology was an unacceptable infringement of civil liberties . Unwilling to be quiet about the issue , he openly protested the trials of Communist Party members and the activities of the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee . Chaplin received a subpoena to appear before HUAC , but was not called to testify . As his activities were widely reported in the press , and Cold War fears grew , questions were raised over his failure to take American citizenship . Calls were made for him to be deported ; in one extreme and widely published example , Representative John E. Rankin , who helped establish HUAC , told Congress in June 1947 : " [ Chaplin 's ] very life in Hollywood is detrimental to the moral fabric of America . [ If he is deported ] ... his loathsome pictures can be kept from before the eyes of the American youth . He should be deported and gotten rid of at once . "

 Although Chaplin remained politically active in the years following the failure of Monsieur Verdoux , his next film , about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London , was devoid of political themes . Limelight was heavily autobiographical , alluding not only to Chaplin 's childhood and the lives of his parents , but also to his loss of popularity in the United States . The cast included various members of his family , including his five oldest children and his half @-@ brother , Wheeler Dryden . 
 Filming began in November 1951 , by which time Chaplin had spent three years working on the story . He aimed for a more serious tone than any of his previous films , regularly using the word " melancholy " when explaining his plans to his co @-@ star Claire Bloom . Limelight featured a cameo appearance from Buster Keaton , whom Chaplin cast as his stage partner in a pantomime scene . This marked the only time the comedians worked together . 
 Chaplin decided to hold the world premiere of Limelight in London , since it was the setting of the film . As he left Los Angeles , he expressed a premonition that he would not be returning . At New York , he boarded the RMS Queen Elizabeth with his family on 18 September 1952 . The next day , attorney general James P. McGranery revoked Chaplin 's re @-@ entry permit and stated that he would have to submit to an interview concerning his political views and moral behaviour in order to re @-@ enter the US . Although McGranery told the press that he had " a pretty good case against Chaplin " , Maland has concluded , on the basis of the FBI files that were released in the 1980s , that the US government had no real evidence to prevent Chaplin 's re @-@ entry . It is likely that he would have gained entry if he had applied for it . However , when Chaplin received a cablegram informing him of the news , he privately decided to cut his ties with the United States : 
 Whether I re @-@ entered that unhappy country or not was of little consequence to me . I would like to have told them that the sooner I was rid of that hate @-@ beleaguered atmosphere the better , that I was fed up of America 's insults and moral pomposity ... 
 Because all of his property remained in America , Chaplin refrained from saying anything negative about the incident to the press . The scandal attracted vast attention , but Chaplin and his film were warmly received in Europe . In America the hostility towards him continued , and , although it received some positive reviews , Limelight was subjected to a wide @-@ scale boycott . Reflecting on this , Maland writes that Chaplin 's fall , from an " unprecedented " level of popularity , " may be the most dramatic in the history of stardom in America " .

 Chaplin did not attempt to return to the United States after his re @-@ entry permit was revoked , and instead sent his wife to settle his affairs . The couple decided to settle in Switzerland , and in January 1953 the family moved into their permanent home : Manoir de Ban , a 14 @-@ hectare ( 35 @-@ acre ) estate overlooking Lake Geneva in Corsier @-@ sur @-@ Vevey . Chaplin put his Beverly Hills house and studio up for sale in March , and surrendered his re @-@ entry permit in April . The next year , his wife renounced her US citizenship and became a British citizen . Chaplin severed the last of his professional ties with the United States in 1955 , when he sold the remainder of his stock in United Artists , which had been in financial difficulty since the early 1940s . 
 Chaplin remained a controversial figure throughout the 1950s , especially after he was awarded the International Peace Prize by the communist @-@ led World Peace Council , and after his meetings with Zhou Enlai and Nikita Khrushchev . He began developing his first European film , A King in New York , in 1954 . Casting himself as an exiled king who seeks asylum in the United States , Chaplin included several of his recent experiences in the screenplay . His son , Michael , was cast as a boy whose parents are targeted by the FBI , while Chaplin 's character faces accusations of communism . The political satire parodied HUAC and attacked elements of 1950s culture – including consumerism , plastic surgery , and wide @-@ screen cinema . In a review , the playwright John Osborne called it Chaplin 's " most bitter " and " most openly personal " film . 
 Chaplin founded a new production company , Attica , and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting . Filming in England proved a difficult experience , as he was used to his own Hollywood studio and familiar crew , and no longer had limitless production time . According to Robinson , this had an effect on the quality of the film . A King in New York was released in September 1957 , and received mixed reviews . Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première , and decided not to release the film in the United States . This severely limited its revenue , although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe . A King in New York was not shown in America until 1973 . 
 = = = = Final works and renewed appreciation = = = = 
 In the last two decades of his career , Chaplin concentrated on re @-@ editing and scoring his old films for re @-@ release , along with securing their ownership and distribution rights . In an interview he granted in 1959 , the year of his 70th birthday , Chaplin stated that there was still " room for the Little Man in the atomic age " . The first of these re @-@ releases was The Chaplin Revue ( 1959 ) , which included new versions of A Dog 's Life , Shoulder Arms , and The Pilgrim . 
 In America , the political atmosphere began to change and attention was once again directed to Chaplin 's films instead of his views . In July 1962 , The New York Times published an editorial stating that " we do not believe the Republic would be in danger if yesterday 's unforgotten little tramp were allowed to amble down the gangplank of a steamer or plane in an American port " . The same month , Chaplin was invested with the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the universities of Oxford and Durham . In November 1963 , the Plaza Theater in New York started a year @-@ long series of Chaplin 's films , including Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight , which gained excellent reviews from American critics . September 1964 saw the release of Chaplin 's memoirs , My Autobiography , which he had been working on since 1957 . The 500 @-@ page book , which focused on his early years and personal life , became a worldwide best @-@ seller , despite criticism over the lack of information on his film career . 
 Shortly after the publication of his memoirs , Chaplin began work on A Countess from Hong Kong ( 1967 ) , a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s . Set on an ocean liner , it starred Marlon Brando as an American ambassador and Sophia Loren as a stowaway found in his cabin . The film differed from Chaplin 's earlier productions in several aspects . It was his first to use Technicolor and the widescreen format , while he concentrated on directing and appeared on @-@ screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward . He also signed a deal with Universal Pictures and appointed his assistant , Jerome Epstein , as the producer . Chaplin was paid $ 600 @,@ 000 director 's fee as well as a percentage of the gross receipts . A Countess from Hong Kong premiered in January 1967 , to unfavourable reviews , and was a box @-@ office failure . Chaplin was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to the film , which turned out to be his last . 
 Chaplin suffered a series of minor strokes in the late 1960s , which marked the beginning of a slow decline in his health . Despite the setbacks , he was soon writing a new film script , The Freak , a story of a winged girl found in South America , which he intended as a starring vehicle for his daughter Victoria . His fragile health prevented the project from being realised . In the early 1970s , Chaplin concentrated on re @-@ releasing his old films , including The Kid and The Circus . In 1971 , he was made a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour at the Cannes Film Festival . The following year , he was honoured with a special award by the Venice Film Festival . 
 In 1972 , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences offered Chaplin an Honorary Award , which Robinson sees as a sign that America " wanted to make amends " . Chaplin was initially hesitant about accepting , but decided to return to the US for the first time in 20 years . The visit attracted a large amount of press coverage , and at the Academy Awards gala he was given a twelve @-@ minute standing ovation , the longest in the Academy 's history . Visibly emotional , Chaplin accepted his award for " the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century " . 
 Although Chaplin still had plans for future film projects , by the mid @-@ 1970s he was very frail . He experienced several further strokes , which made it difficult for him to communicate , and he had to use a wheelchair . His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography , My Life in Pictures ( 1974 ) and scoring A Woman of Paris for re @-@ release in 1976 . He also appeared in a documentary about his life , The Gentleman Tramp ( 1975 ) , directed by Richard Patterson . In the 1975 New Year Honours , Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II , though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair . 
 = = = = Death = = = = 
 By October 1977 , Chaplin 's health had declined to the point that he needed constant care . In the early morning of 25 December 1977 , Chaplin died at home after suffering a stroke in his sleep . He was 88 years old . The funeral , on 27 December , was a small and private Anglican ceremony , according to his wishes . Chaplin was interred in the Corsier @-@ sur @-@ Vevey cemetery . Among the film industry 's tributes , director René Clair wrote , " He was a monument of the cinema , of all countries and all times ... the most beautiful gift the cinema made to us . " Actor Bob Hope declared , " We were lucky to have lived in his time . " 
 On 1 March 1978 , Chaplin 's coffin was dug up and stolen from its grave by two unemployed immigrants , Roman <unk> , from Poland , and <unk> <unk> , from Bulgaria . The body was held for ransom in an attempt to extort money from Oona Chaplin . The pair were caught in a large police operation in May , and Chaplin 's coffin was found buried in a field in the nearby village of <unk> . It was re @-@ interred in the Corsier cemetery surrounded by reinforced concrete .

 Chaplin believed his first influence to be his mother , who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers @-@ by : " it was through watching her that I learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face , but also how to observe and study people . " Chaplin 's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work ; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane , where he studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno . Chaplin 's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker . Simon Louvish writes that the company was his " training ground " , and it was here that Chaplin learnt to vary the pace of his comedy . The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno , who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin 's gags . From the film industry , Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder , whose films he greatly admired . In developing the Tramp costume and persona , he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene , where tramp characters were common . 
 = = = Method = = = 
 Chaplin never spoke more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods , claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion . Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime , but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three @-@ part documentary Unknown Chaplin ( 1983 ) – has since revealed his unique working method . 
 Until he began making spoken dialogue films with The Great Dictator , Chaplin never shot from a completed script . Many of his early films began with only a vague premise – for example " Charlie enters a health spa " or " Charlie works in a pawn shop . " He then had sets constructed and worked with his stock company to improvise gags and " business " using them , almost always working the ideas out on film . As ideas were accepted and discarded , a narrative structure would emerge , frequently requiring Chaplin to reshoot an already @-@ completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted the story . From A Woman of Paris onward Chaplin began the filming process with a prepared plot , but Robinson writes that every film up to Modern Times " went through many metamorphoses and permutations before the story took its final form . " 
 Producing films in this manner meant Chaplin took longer to complete his pictures than almost any other filmmaker at the time . If he was out of ideas he often took a break from the shoot , which could last for days , while keeping the studio ready for when inspiration returned . Delaying the process further was Chaplin 's rigorous perfectionism . According to his friend Ivor Montagu , " nothing but perfection would be right " for the filmmaker . Because he personally funded his films , Chaplin was at liberty to strive for this goal and shoot as many takes as he wished . The number was often excessive , for instance 53 takes for every finished take in The Kid . For The Immigrant , a 20 minute @-@ short , Chaplin shot 40 @,@ 000 feet of film – enough for a feature @-@ length . 
 Describing his working method as " sheer perseverance to the point of madness " , Chaplin would be completely consumed by the production of a picture . Robinson writes that even in Chaplin 's later years , his work continued " to take precedence over everything and everyone else . " The combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism – which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted , all at enormous expense – often proved taxing for Chaplin who , in frustration , would lash out at his actors and crew . 
 Chaplin exercised complete control over his pictures , to the extent that he would act out the other roles for his cast , expecting them to imitate him exactly . He personally edited all of his films , trawling through the large amounts of footage to create the exact picture he wanted . As a result of his complete independence , he was identified by the film historian Andrew Sarris as one of the first auteur filmmakers . Chaplin did receive help , notably from his long @-@ time cinematographer Roland <unk> , brother Sydney Chaplin , and various assistant directors such as Harry Crocker and Charles Reisner . 
 = = = Style and themes = = = 
 While Chaplin 's comedic style is broadly defined as slapstick , it is considered restrained and intelligent , with the film historian Philip Kemp describing his work as a mix of " deft , balletic physical comedy and thoughtful , situation @-@ based gags " . Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential , with more focus on developing the viewer 's relationship to the characters . Unlike conventional slapstick comedies , Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin 's films centre on the Tramp 's attitude to the things happening to him : the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree , but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology . Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin 's " quirky mannerisms " and " serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action " are other key aspects of his comedy , while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in @-@ camera trickery are also common features . 
 Chaplin 's silent films typically follow the Tramp 's efforts to survive in a hostile world . The character lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly , but remains kind and upbeat ; defying his social position , he strives to be seen as a gentleman . As Chaplin said in 1925 , " The whole point of the Little Fellow is that no matter how down on his ass he is , no matter how well the jackals succeed in tearing him apart , he 's still a man of dignity . " The Tramp defies authority figures and " gives as good as he gets " , leading Robinson and Louvish to see him as a representative for the underprivileged – an " everyman turned heroic saviour " . <unk> notes that several of Chaplin 's films end with " the homeless and lonely Tramp [ walking ] optimistically ... into the sunset ... to continue his journey " . 
 The infusion of pathos is a well @-@ known aspect of Chaplin 's work , and Larcher notes his reputation for " [ inducing ] laughter and tears " . Sentimentality in his films come from a variety of sources , with Louvish pinpointing " personal failure , society 's strictures , economic disaster , and the elements . " Chaplin sometimes drew on tragic events when creating his films , as in the case of The Gold Rush ( 1925 ) , which was inspired by the fate of the Donner Party . Constance B. Kuriyama has identified serious underlying themes in the early comedies , such as greed ( The Gold Rush ) and loss ( The Kid ) . Chaplin also touched on controversial issues : immigration ( The Immigrant , 1917 ) ; illegitimacy ( The Kid , 1921 ) ; and drug use ( Easy Street , 1917 ) . He often explored these topics ironically , making comedy out of suffering . 
 Social commentary was a feature of Chaplin 's films from early in his career , as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor . Later , as he developed a keen interest in economics and felt obliged to publicise his views , Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films . Modern Times ( 1936 ) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions , The Great Dictator ( 1940 ) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism , Monsieur Verdoux ( 1947 ) criticised war and capitalism , and A King in New York ( 1957 ) attacked McCarthyism . 
 Several of Chaplin 's films incorporate autobiographical elements , and the psychologist Sigmund Freud believed that Chaplin " always plays only himself as he was in his dismal youth " . The Kid is thought to reflect Chaplin 's childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage , the main characters in Limelight ( 1952 ) contain elements from the lives of his parents , and A King in New York references Chaplin 's experiences of being shunned by the United States . Many of his sets , especially in street scenes , bear a strong similarity to Kennington , where he grew up . Stephen M. Weissman has argued that Chaplin 's problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother was often reflected in his female characters and the Tramp 's desire to save them . 
 Regarding the structure of Chaplin 's films , the scholar Gerald Mast sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting , rather than having a tightly unified storyline . Visually , his films are simple and economic , with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage . His approach to filming was described by the art director Eugène <unk> : " Chaplin did not think in ' artistic ' images when he was shooting . He believed that action is the main thing . The camera is there to photograph the actors " . In his autobiography , Chaplin wrote , " Simplicity is best ... pompous effects slow up action , are boring and unpleasant ... The camera should not intrude . " This approach has prompted criticism , since the 1940s , for being " old fashioned " , while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium . Kamin , however , comments that Chaplin 's comedic talent would not be enough to remain funny on screen if he did not have an " ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium " . 
 = = = Composing = = = 
 Chaplin developed a passion for music as a child , and taught himself to play the piano , violin , and cello . He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important , and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area . With the advent of sound technology , Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights ( 1931 ) . He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films , and from the late 1950s to his death , he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films . 
 As Chaplin was not a trained musician , he could not read sheet music and needed the help of professional composers , such as David <unk> , Raymond Rasch and Eric James , when creating his scores . Although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music should be given to the composers who worked with him , <unk> – who worked with Chaplin on Modern Times – stressed Chaplin 's creative position and active participation in the composing process . This process , which could take months , would start with Chaplin describing to the composer ( s ) exactly what he wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano . These tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composer ( s ) and Chaplin . According to film historian Jeffrey Vance , " although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation , the musical imperative is his , and not a note in a Chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent . " 
 Chaplin 's compositions produced three popular songs . " Smile " , composed originally for Modern Times ( 1936 ) and later set to lyrics by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons , was a hit for Nat King Cole in 1954 . For Limelight , Chaplin composed " Terry 's Theme " , which was popularised by Jimmy Young as " Eternally " ( 1952 ) . Finally , " This Is My Song " , performed by Petula Clark for A Countess from Hong Kong ( 1967 ) , reached number one on the UK and other European charts . Chaplin also received his only competitive Oscar for his composition work , as the Limelight theme won an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1973 following the film 's re @-@ release . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 In 1998 , the film critic Andrew Sarris called Chaplin " arguably the single most important artist produced by the cinema , certainly its most extraordinary performer and probably still its most universal icon " . He is described by the British Film Institute as " a towering figure in world culture " , and was included in Time magazine 's list of the " 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century " for the " laughter [ he brought ] to millions " and because he " more or less invented global recognizability and helped turn an industry into an art " . 
 The image of the Tramp has become a part of cultural history ; according to Simon Louvish , the character is recognisable to people who have never seen a Chaplin film , and in places where his films are never shown . The critic Leonard Maltin has written of the " unique " and " indelible " nature of the Tramp , and argued that no other comedian matched his " worldwide impact " . Praising the character , Richard Schickel suggests that Chaplin 's films with the Tramp contain the most " eloquent , richly comedic expressions of the human spirit " in movie history . Memorabilia connected to the character still fetches large sums in auctions : in 2006 a bowler hat and a bamboo cane that were part of the Tramp 's costume were bought for $ 140 @,@ 000 in a Los Angeles auction . 
 As a filmmaker , Chaplin is considered a pioneer and one of the most influential figures of the early twentieth century . He is often credited as one of the medium 's first artists . Film historian Mark Cousins has written that Chaplin " changed not only the imagery of cinema , but also its sociology and grammar " and claims that Chaplin was as important to the development of comedy as a genre as D.W. Griffith was to drama . He was the first to popularise feature @-@ length comedy and to slow down the pace of action , adding pathos and subtlety to it . Although his work is mostly classified as slapstick , Chaplin 's drama A Woman of Paris ( 1923 ) was a major influence on Ernst Lubitsch 's film The Marriage Circle ( 1924 ) and thus played a part in the development of " sophisticated comedy " . According to David Robinson , Chaplin 's innovations were " rapidly assimilated to become part of the common practice of film craft . " Filmmakers who cited Chaplin as an influence include Federico Fellini ( who called Chaplin " a sort of Adam , from whom we are all descended " ) , Jacques Tati ( " Without him I would never have made a film " ) , René Clair ( " He inspired practically every filmmaker " ) , Michael Powell , Billy Wilder , Vittorio De Sica , and Richard Attenborough . Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky praised Chaplin as " the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt . The films he left behind can never grow old . " 
 Chaplin also strongly influenced the work of later comedians . Marcel Marceau said he was inspired to become a mime artist after watching Chaplin , while the actor Raj Kapoor based his screen persona on the Tramp . Mark Cousins has also detected Chaplin 's comedic style in the French character Monsieur Hulot and the Italian character Totò . In other fields , Chaplin helped inspire the cartoon characters Felix the Cat and Mickey Mouse , and was an influence on the Dada art movement . As one of the founding members of United Artists , Chaplin also had a role in the development of the film industry . Gerald Mast has written that although UA never became a major company like MGM or Paramount Pictures , the idea that directors could produce their own films was " years ahead of its time " . 
 In the 21st century , several of Chaplin 's films are still regarded as classics and among the greatest ever made . The 2012 Sight & Sound poll , which compiles " top ten " ballots from film critics and directors to determine each group 's most acclaimed films , saw City Lights rank among the critics ' top 50 , Modern Times inside the top 100 , and The Great Dictator and The Gold Rush placed in the top 250 . The top 100 films as voted on by directors included Modern Times at number 22 , City Lights at number 30 , and The Gold Rush at number 91 . Every one of Chaplin 's features received a vote . In 2007 , the American Film Institute named City Lights the 11th greatest American film of all time , while The Gold Rush and Modern Times again ranked in the top 100 . Books about Chaplin continue to be published regularly , and he is a popular subject for media scholars and film archivists . Many of Chaplin 's film have had a DVD and Blu @-@ Ray release .

 Several memorials have been dedicated to Chaplin . In his home city , London , a statue of Chaplin as the Tramp , sculpted by John Doubleday and unveiled in 1981 , is located in Leicester Square . The city also includes a road named after him in central London , " Charlie Chaplin Walk " , which is the location of the BFI IMAX . The former Museum of the Moving Image held a permanent display on Chaplin , and hosted a dedicated exhibition to his life and career in 1988 . The London Film Museum hosted an exhibition called Charlie Chaplin – The Great Londoner , from 2010 until 2013 . 
 Chaplin 's final home , Manoir de Ban in Corsier @-@ sur @-@ Vevey , Switzerland , was converted into a museum and opened on 17 April 2016 , exploring his life and career . The nearby town of Vevey named a park in his honour in 1980 and erected a statue there in 1982 . In 2011 , two large murals depicting Chaplin on two 14 @-@ storey buildings were also unveiled in Vevey . Chaplin has also been honoured by the Irish town of Waterville , where he spent several summers with his family in the 1960s . A statue was erected in 1998 , and since 2011 the town has been host to the annual Charlie Chaplin Comedy Film Festival , which was founded to celebrate Chaplin 's legacy and to showcase new comic talent . 
 In other tributes , a minor planet , <unk> Chaplin – discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila <unk> in 1981 – is named after Chaplin . Throughout the 1980s , the Tramp image was used by IBM to advertise their personal computers . Chaplin 's 100th birthday anniversary in 1989 was marked with several events around the world , and on 15 April 2011 , a day before his 122nd birthday , Google celebrated him with a special Google Doodle video on its global and other country @-@ wide homepages . Many countries , spanning six continents , have honoured Chaplin with a postal stamp . 
 Chaplin 's legacy is managed on behalf of his children by the Chaplin office , located in Paris . The office represents Association Chaplin , founded by some of his children " to protect the name , image and moral rights " to his body of work , Roy Export SAS , which owns the copyright to most of his films made after 1918 , and Bubbles Incorporated S.A. , which owns the copyrights to his image and name . Their central archive is held at the archives of Montreux , Switzerland and scanned versions of its contents , including 83 @,@ 630 images , 118 scripts , 976 manuscripts , 7 @,@ 756 letters , and thousands of other documents , are available for research purposes at the Chaplin Research Centre at the <unk> di Bologna . The photographic archive , which includes approximately 10 @,@ 000 photographs from Chaplin 's life and career , is kept at the Musée de l <unk> in Lausanne , Switzerland . The British Film Institute has also established the Charles Chaplin Research Foundation , and the first international Charles Chaplin Conference was held in London in July 2005 .

 Chaplin is the subject of a biographical film , Chaplin ( 1992 ) directed by Richard Attenborough , and starring Robert Downey , Jr. in the title role . He is also a character in the period drama film The Cat 's Meow ( 2001 ) , played by Eddie Izzard , and in the made @-@ for @-@ television movie The Scarlett O 'Hara War ( 1980 ) , played by Clive Revill . A television series about Chaplin 's childhood , Young Charlie Chaplin , ran on PBS in 1989 , and was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Children 's Program . 
 Chaplin 's life has also been the subject of several stage productions . Two musicals , Little Tramp and Chaplin , were produced in the early 1990s . In 2006 , Thomas Meehan and Christopher Curtis created another musical , Limelight : The Story of Charlie Chaplin , which was first performed at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego in 2010 . It was adapted for Broadway two years later , re @-@ titled Chaplin – A Musical . Chaplin was portrayed by Robert McClure in both productions . In 2013 , two plays about Chaplin premiered in Finland : Chaplin at the Svenska <unk> , and <unk> ( The Tramp ) at the Tampere Workers ' Theatre . Chaplin has also been characterised in literary fiction , as the central character in Glen David Gold 's Sunnyside ( 2009 ) , a novel set in the First World War period . 
 = = Awards and recognition = = 
 Chaplin received many awards and honours , especially later in life . In the 1975 New Year Honours , he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire . He was also awarded honorary Doctor of Letters degrees by the University of Oxford and the University of Durham in 1962 . In 1965 he and Ingmar Bergman were joint winners of the Erasmus Prize and in 1971 he was appointed a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour by the French government . 
 From the film industry , Chaplin received a special Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1972 , and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Lincoln Center Film Society the same year . The latter has since been presented annually to filmmakers as The Chaplin Award . Chaplin was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1972 , having been previously excluded because of his political beliefs . 
 Chaplin received three Academy Awards : an Honorary Award for " versatility and genius in acting , writing , directing , and producing The Circus " in 1929 , a second Honorary Award for " the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century " in 1972 , and a Best Score award in 1973 for Limelight ( shared with Ray Rasch and Larry Russell ) . He was further nominated in the Best Actor , Best Original Screenplay , and Best Picture ( as producer ) categories for The Great Dictator , and received another Best Original Screenplay nomination for Monsieur Verdoux . 
 Six of Chaplin 's films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress : The Immigrant ( 1917 ) , The Kid ( 1921 ) , The Gold Rush ( 1925 ) , City Lights ( 1931 ) , Modern Times ( 1936 ) , and The Great Dictator ( 1940 ) .

 The Admiralty Islands campaign ( Operation Brewer ) was a series of battles in the New Guinea campaign of World War II in which the United States Army 's 1st Cavalry Division occupied the Japanese @-@ held Admiralty Islands . 
 Acting on reports from airmen that there were no signs of enemy activity and the islands might have been evacuated , General Douglas MacArthur accelerated his timetable for capturing the Admiralties and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force . The campaign began on 29 February 1944 when a force landed on Los Negros , the third @-@ largest island in the group . By using a small , isolated beach where the Japanese had not anticipated an assault , the force achieved tactical surprise , but the islands proved to be far from unoccupied . A furious battle over the islands ensued . 
 In the end , air superiority and command of the sea allowed the Allies to heavily reinforce their position on Los Negros . The 1st Cavalry Division could then overrun the islands . The campaign officially ended on 18 May 1944 . The Allied victory completed the isolation of the major Japanese base at Rabaul that was the ultimate objective of the Allied campaigns of 1942 and 1943 . A major air and naval base was developed in the Admiralty Islands that became an important launching point for the campaigns of 1944 in the Pacific .

 = = = Geography = = = 
 The Admiralty Islands lie 200 miles ( 320 km ) north east of the mainland of New Guinea and 360 miles ( 580 km ) west of Rabaul , only two degrees south of the equator . The climate is tropical , with constant high temperatures and high humidity and an annual rainfall of 154 inches ( 3 @,@ 900 mm ) . Thunderstorms are common . December to May is the north west monsoon season , with prevailing winds from that direction . 
 The largest island in the group is Manus Island , which is about 49 miles ( 79 km ) across from east to west and 16 miles ( 26 km ) wide from north to south . The interior is mountainous , with peaks rising to 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) and largely covered with thick tropical rainforest . The then largely uncharted coastline has numerous reefs . The shoreline consisted mostly of mangrove swamp . Los Negros is separated from Manus by the narrow <unk> Passage . The island contains two important harbours of its own , <unk> on the west coast , which connects with Seeadler Harbour , and Hyane on the east coast . The two are separated by a 50 @-@ yard ( 46 m ) wide sandy spit . Here , the natives built a skidway over which they could drag canoes between the two harbours . Los Negros curves horseshoe @-@ like , forming a natural breakwater for Seeadler Harbour , the remainder of which is enclosed by Manus and a series of smaller islands . The main entrance was through a 1 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) wide passage between Hauwei and Ndrilo Islands . Seeadler Harbour is about 20 miles ( 32 km ) across from east to west and 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) wide from north to south , and up to 120 feet ( 37 m ) deep .

 In July 1942 , the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a series of operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul , which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of New Guinea towards the Philippines or northward towards the main Japanese naval base at Truk . In keeping with the overall Allied grand strategy of Europe first , the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely the reduction of the threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia . By agreement among the Allied nations , in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into the South West Pacific Area , under General Douglas MacArthur , and the Pacific Ocean Areas , under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz . Rabaul fell within MacArthur 's area but the initial operations in the southern Solomon Islands came under Nimitz . The Japanese reaction was more violent than anticipated and some months passed before the Guadalcanal Campaign was brought to a successful conclusion . Meanwhile , General MacArthur 's forces — primarily Australian — fought off a series of Japanese offensives in Papua in the Kokoda Track Campaign , Battle of Milne Bay , Battle of Buna @-@ Gona , and the Battle of Wau . 
 At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943 , the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved the latest version of General MacArthur 's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul . Owing to a shortage of resources , particularly heavy bomber aircraft , the final stage of the plan , the capture of Rabaul itself , was postponed until 1944 . By July 1943 , the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul , but the navy would still need a forward fleet base . The Admiralty Islands , already a part of the Elkton plan , could serve this purpose , as they contained flat areas for airstrips , space for military installations , and Seeadler Harbour , which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force . On 6 August 1943 , the Joint Chiefs of Staff adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul , and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944 . 
 Throughout January 1944 , <unk> aircraft based in the Solomon Islands and Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) aircraft based on Kiriwina kept up a sustained air offensive against Rabaul . Under steady and relentless pressure , the Japanese air defence began to weaken , allowing a landing to be made on 15 February in the Green Islands , which lie little more than 100 miles ( 160 km ) from Rabaul . On 16 and 17 February , the US Pacific Fleet 's Task Force 58 attacked the main Japanese base at Truk . Most Japanese aircraft were recalled to defend Truk and 19 February saw the last significant interception of Allied aircraft over Rabaul . Meanwhile , on 13 February , General MacArthur had issued orders for the invasion of the Admiralty Islands , codenamed Operation Brewer , which was now scheduled for 1 April . Forces assigned included the 1st Cavalry Division ; No. 73 Wing RAAF , providing close air support ; the 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment ( EBSR ) ; the US Marines ' 1st Amphibious Tractor Battalion ; and US Naval Construction Battalions ( " Seabees " ) to build the naval base — a total of 45 @,@ 000 personnel . However , on 23 February 1944 three Fifth Air Force B @-@ 25 Mitchell bombers flew low over Los Negros . The airmen reported that there were no signs of enemy activity and the islands had been evacuated . Lieutenant General George Kenney , the commander of Allied Air Forces in the South West Pacific Area , went to MacArthur and proposed that the unoccupied islands be quickly taken by a small force . According to Kenney : " The General listened for a while , paced back and forth as I kept talking , nodded occasionally , then suddenly stopped and said : That will put the cork in the bottle . " 
 Orders went out on 24 February 1944 for a reinforced squadron of the 1st Cavalry Division to carry out a reconnaissance in force in just five days time . If the Admiralty Islands were indeed evacuated , they would be occupied and a base developed . If the enemy was unexpectedly strong , then the force could be withdrawn . General MacArthur and Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid , the commander of Allied Naval Forces in the South West Pacific Area , would be on hand to make the decision but otherwise they delegated command to Rear Admiral William Fechteler , the commander of Amphibious Group 8 of Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey 's VII Amphibious Force . To accommodate them , the light cruiser USS Phoenix was ordered to sea . At the time , she was in Brisbane , with over 300 of her crew on shore leave . Trucks with bull horns broadcast the code word recalling the crew . In order to achieve surprise , and to reach the Admiralty Islands in just five days , high speed transports ( APDs ) were required ; Landing Ships , Tank ( LSTs ) were too slow to make the required distance in the time . Only three APDs were available : USS Brooks , Humphreys and Sands . Each could accommodate 170 men . The remaining troops were carried on nine destroyers : USS Bush , Drayton , Flusser , Mahan , Reid , Smith , Stevenson , Stockton and Welles . Between them , the destroyers and APDs carried 1 @,@ 026 troops . 
 This force was commanded by Brigadier General William C. Chase , commander of the 1st Brigade , 1st Cavalry Division . It included the three rifle troops and the heavy weapons troop of the 2nd Squadron , 5th Cavalry ; a platoon from Battery B , 99th Field Artillery Battalion with two 75 mm pack howitzers ; the <unk> Anti @-@ Aircraft Machine Gun Battery ( Airborne ) ; and 29 Australians of the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit ( ANGAU ) , who were to assist in gathering intelligence and dealing with the native population , some 13 @,@ 000 of whom lived in the islands . Once the decision to remain was known , a follow @-@ up force with the rest of the 5th Cavalry and 99th Field Artillery Battalion , 40th Naval Construction Battalion , and 2 @,@ 500 measurement tons of stores would depart from Finschhafen in six Landing Ships , Tank ( LSTs ) , each towing an LCM of Company E , 592nd EBSR . When an aide expressed concern over assigning such a hazardous mission to a unit without combat experience , General MacArthur recalled how the 5th Cavalry had fought alongside his father 's troops in the campaign against Geronimo . " They 'd fight then , " he said , " and they 'll fight now . " 
 Major General Charles A. Willoughby 's G @-@ 2 ( intelligence ) section did not agree with the airmen 's assessment the islands were unoccupied . Drawing on Ultra and Allied Intelligence Bureau reports from interrogating local civilians , it reported on 15 February that there were 3 @,@ 000 Japanese troops in the Admiralty Islands . On 24 February , it revised the estimate to 4 @,@ 000 . G @-@ 2 attributed the lack of anti @-@ aircraft fire to the Japanese logistical situation , believing it was a measure to conserve ammunition . Lieutenant General Walter Krueger , the commander of U.S. Sixth Army later recalled no one at his headquarters believed the islands unoccupied . In the original plan , a team of Alamo Scouts was to have thoroughly reconnoitred the island before the landing . Krueger had a six @-@ man party of Alamo Scouts inserted on the southern coast of Los Negros by PBY under cover of a bombing raid on 27 February . The scouts reported the south coast was " lousy with Japs " .

 The Japanese defence of the Admiralties fell under the Eighth Area Army , based at Rabaul and commanded by General Hitoshi Imamura . In September 1943 , as a result of the failure to stop Allied advances in New Guinea and the Solomons , the Imperial General Headquarters ( IGHQ ) had decided to constrict Japan 's defensive perimeter in the south and central Pacific to a new line stretching from the Banda Sea to the Caroline Islands . The IGHQ charged Imamura with holding his portion of the new line , which included the Admiralties , as long as possible to allow the Japanese navy and army time to prepare " decisive " counterattacks against Allied forces . Maintaining control of the Admiralties was crucial to the Japanese defensive plans , as possession of the islands by the Allies would place the key Japanese stronghold at Truk within range of heavy bombers . Apparently not expecting the Allies to move on the Admiralties so quickly , IGHQ gave Imamura until the middle of 1944 to complete the defensive preparations for his command . At this time the largest Japanese unit in the islands was the 51st Transport Regiment , which had arrived on Los Negros in April . 
 Imamura sought reinforcements for the Admiralties in late 1943 and early 1944 . In October 1943 he requested an infantry division for the islands , but none was available . A subsequent proposal to transfer the 66th Regiment from the Palaus , where it was being rebuilt after suffering heavy losses , to the Admiralties was also unsuccessful as IGHQ believed that the Eighteenth Army had greater need for this unit . The Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) also rejected Imamura 's suggestion that a special naval landing force unit be dispatched to the islands . IGHQ agreed to deploy the 66th Regiment to the Admiralties in January 1944 to bolster the region 's defenses following the Allied landings at Arawe and Saidor in mid @-@ December and early January respectively , but this movement was cancelled after a ship carrying reinforcements for the regiment was sunk by USS Whale with heavy loss of life on the 16th of the month . Following this disaster Imamura directed the 38th Division to dispatch a battalion to the islands , and 750 men of the 2nd Battalion , 1st Independent Mixed Regiment arrived there on the night of 24 / 25 January . A subsequent attempt to ship an infantry and an artillery battalion to the Admiralties was frustrated by Allied air and submarine attacks , but 530 soldiers of the 38th Division 's 1st Battalion , 229th Infantry Regiment arrived there on the night of 2 February . Most of these troop movements were detected by Allied intelligence . 
 At the time of the Allied landing , Imperial Japanese Army forces in the Admiralties consisted of the 51st Transport Regiment under Colonel Yoshio Ezaki , who was also the overall garrison commander ; 2nd Battalion , 1st Independent Mixed Regiment ; 1st Battalion , 229th Infantry Regiment ; and elements of the IJN 's 14th Naval Base Force . Allied G @-@ 2 had identified the presence of all these units in the Admiralties , though their designation was not known in all instances . While the 1st Battalion , 229th Infantry Regiment was a veteran of several campaigns , it was short of equipment and lacked its battalion artillery guns . The 2nd Battalion , 1st Independent Mixed Regiment was led by reserve officers who had seen action in China , but most of its enlisted men were recalled reservists who had not previously been in battle . 
 The 51st Transport Regiment had constructed an airstrip on Lorengau and commenced another , known as Momote Airstrip , at the Momote Plantation on Los Negros . Lorengau was used as a staging point for aircraft moving between Rabaul and airstrips in North East New Guinea . The importance of the Admiralty Islands to the Japanese increased as the result of Allied advances in New Guinea and New Britain which blocked off other air routes . By February , both airstrips were unserviceable and the antiaircraft guns were silent in order to conserve ammunition and conceal their positions . Ezaki had ordered his men to neither move nor fire in daylight . 
 = = Battle of Los Negros = = 
 = = = Landing = = = 
 The chosen landing site was a small beach on the south shore of Hyane Harbour near the Momote airstrip . The airstrip could be seized quickly ; but the surrounding area was mangrove swamp , and the harbour entrance was only about 750 yards ( 700 m ) wide . " Since the whole operation was a gamble anyway , " Samuel Eliot Morison noted , " one might as well be consistent . " The gamble paid off . The Japanese had not anticipated a landing at this point and the bulk of their forces were concentrated to defend the beaches of Seeadler Harbour , on the other side of the island . The weather on 29 February 1944 was overcast with a low cloud ceiling that prevented most of the planned air strike . Only three B @-@ 24s and nine B @-@ 25s found the target . The naval bombardment was therefore extended for another 15 minutes . Each APD lowered four LCPRs ( Landing Craft , Personnel , <unk> ) . Each <unk> carried its maximum load of 37 men , who boarded by climbing over the APDs ' sides and down cargo nets . The unarmoured LCPRs were still used because davits had not been strengthened to carry the heavier , armoured LCVP ( Landing Craft , Vehicle , Personnel ) . 
 The first wave landed without casualties at 08 : 17 , but once the bombardment lifted the Japanese emerged from their dugouts and machine guns and shore batteries began firing . The landing craft , on returning , came under crossfire from enemy machine guns on both sides of the harbour . The fire became so heavy the second wave was forced to reverse course until the enemy fire was suppressed by destroyers . The third and fourth waves also came under fire . A correspondent from Yank , the Army Weekly described the scene : 
 As we neared the channel , the Navy men in the bow hollered to us to keep our heads down or we 'd get them blown off . We crouched lower , swearing , and waited . It came with a crack ; machine @-@ gun fire over our heads . Our light landing craft shuddered as the Navy gunners hammered back and answered with the .30 calibers mounted on both sides of the barge . As we made the turn for the beach , something solid plugged into us . " They got one of our guns or something , " one GI said . There was a splinter the size of a half dollar on the pack of the man in front of me . Up front a hole gaped in the middle of the landing ramp and there were no men where there had been four . Our barge headed back toward the destroyer that had carried us to the Admiralties . White splashes of water were plunging through the six @-@ inch gap in the wooden gate . William <unk> , S 1 / c , of Wheeling , West Virginia , ducked from his position at the starboard gun and slammed his hip against the hole to plug it . He was firing a tommy gun at the shore as fast as wounded soldiers could pass him loaded clips . The water sloshed around him , running down his legs and washing the blood of the wounded into a pink frappe . 
 Four of the twelve LCPRs had been damaged . Three were soon repaired , but they could not be risked further , for without them , the reconnaissance force could not be evacuated . The emergency plan provided for an APD to enter the harbour and take troops off from a jetty but this would clearly be a desperate measure indeed . Over the next four hours , the boats continued to make trips to the beach , but only when it was believed destroyers had suppressed enemy fire . Heavy rain made it safer by reducing visibility . The last destroyer was unloaded at 12 : 50 . By this time , the navy had lost two men dead and three wounded . 
 For the moment it was safer ashore . The cavalrymen overran the airstrip . Sporadic opposition allowed them to set up the antiaircraft machine guns on the beach , unload supplies , and patrol inland . Two soldiers were killed and three wounded . At 16 : 00 , General MacArthur and Admiral Kinkaid came ashore . The general inspected the position . A lieutenant warned him a Japanese sniper had been killed in the vicinity just a few minutes before . " That 's the best thing to do with them , " the General replied . He decided to stay , ordering Chase to hold his position until the follow @-@ up force arrived , then returned to Phoenix . Fechteler 's force departed at 17 : 29 , the transports having unloaded and most of the bombardment force having exhausted its ammunition . Bush and Stockton remained to provide on @-@ call naval fire support . 
 = = = Battle for the beachhead = = = 
 Chase pulled his troops back into a tight perimeter . There was no barbed wire , so the whole area had to be covered . The ground was hard coral , which was good for airbase construction but made it difficult to dig foxholes . The twelve .50 calibre ( <unk> ) machine guns were positioned in the front line . There was fighting throughout the night as small groups of Japanese attempted to infiltrate the position . An airdrop of ammunition was requested . A break in the weather allowed three B @-@ 25s of the 38th U.S. Bomb Group to drop supplies at 08 : 30 . Four B @-@ 17s of the 375th Troop Carrier Group each dropped three tons of supplies , including blood plasma , ammunition , hand grenades , and barbed wire . Some of the ammunition fell beyond the perimeter but for some reason men who moved out to retrieve it were not fired upon . 
 The Japanese were not expected to make another effort until dark but at around 16 : 00 a Japanese patrol was discovered that had somehow managed to infiltrate the perimeter in broad daylight and penetrate to within 35 yd ( 32 m ) of General Chase 's command post . A sniper fired on the command post , and fire was directed at the patrol . Major Julio <unk> , S @-@ 2 ( intelligence officer ) of the task force , set out with four men to silence the sniper . As his party closed in , there were a series of explosions . Three Japanese had committed suicide with hand grenades , while another had committed seppuku with his sword . Fifteen dead officers and sergeants were counted , including Captain Baba , the commander of the Japanese battalion which made the attack the preceding night . The Japanese launched another attack on the perimeter at 17 : 00 but could make little progress in the face of American firepower . 
 The next morning saw the arrival of the follow @-@ up force , six LSTs , each towing an LCM , escorted by the destroyers USS Mullany and Ammen and HMAS Warramunga and destroyer minesweepers USS Hamilton and Long . The LSTs entered Hyane Harbour and beached , coming under mortar fire as they did so . LST @-@ 202 , manned by a United States Coast Guard crew , replied with 3 in ( 76mm ) and Bofors 40 mm guns . The LSTs were unloaded over the next seven hours . In the process , ammunition , construction equipment , and stores piled up . To accommodate a proper dispersal of stores , General Chase ordered an attack to expand the perimeter . An air strike was requested . B @-@ 25s of the 345th U.S. Bomb Group were intercepted by an estimated fifteen Japanese fighters . These were driven off by eight escorting P @-@ 47 Thunderbolt fighters , which claimed eight Japanese aircraft shot down . Two B @-@ 17s of the 69th U.S. Troop Carrier Squadron on a supply dropping run were also attacked , and claimed to have shot one of their attackers down . Two of the four B @-@ 25 squadrons dropped bombs in areas occupied by American troops , two of whom were killed and four wounded before the 12th U.S. Air Liaison Party could correct the error . Both squadrons of the 5th Cavalry attacked at 15 : 00 . All objectives were taken and a new , larger defensive perimeter was prepared . The 40th Naval Construction Battalion had landed expecting to work on Momote airstrip . Instead , they were ordered to use their equipment to clear fields of fire and construct fortifications , and were given a section of the perimeter to defend . Six trenches were dug out by a bulldozer and ten men stationed in each . Their ditch digger scooped out a 300 @-@ yard ( 270 m ) trench which formed a secondary line of defence . The airstrip 's revetments were transformed into heavy machine gun posts . 
 The two destroyer minesweepers were supposed to sweep the entrance to Seeadler Harbour between Hauwei and Ndrilo Islands but fire from at least one Japanese 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) gun on Hauwei Island prevented them from entering the harbour . Captain Emile Dechaineux , commanding the destroyers supporting the forces ashore , brought Ammen , Bush , Mullany and Warramunga around and bombarded the island . The Japanese guns ceased fire but came alive again when another attempt was made to sweep the channel . Dechaineux then called off the effort , ordering the <unk> to join him . The destroyers bombarded Japanese guns covering the entrance to Hyane Harbour to allow the LSTs to leave unmolested . One LST left with between 20 and 30 truckloads of stores still aboard . The LSTs did not wish to remain after dark as a Japanese attack was expected . Dechaineux escorted them part of the way until he received an order from Admiral Barbey for Ammen , Mullany , Warramunga , and Welles to remain off Los Negros . Ammen and Mullany bombarded Hauwei Island again in the morning , setting off a couple of ammunition dumps , but still came under accurate fire from four or five guns , and Dechaineux was forced to inform Barbey that he was unable to overcome the island 's guns .
