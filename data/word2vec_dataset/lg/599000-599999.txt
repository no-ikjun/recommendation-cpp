 Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke was known for having a keen eye identifying leadership and teaching qualities ( he also gave Hall of Famers Sparky Anderson and Joe Gibbs their first managerial / head coaching positions ) , and asked West to coach and participate in player personnel decisions . In the 1976 – 77 season , West became coach of the Los Angeles Lakers . In three years , he led the Lakers and star center Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar to a 145 – 101 record , making the playoffs in all 3 seasons and reaching the Western Conference Finals once in 1977 . After his coaching stint , he worked as a scout for three years before becoming general manager of the Lakers prior to the 1982 – 83 season . NBA.com credits West in creating the great 1980s Lakers dynasty , which brought five championship rings ( 1980 , 1982 , 1985 , 1987 and 1988 ) to Los Angeles . After a slump in the early 1990s , West rebuilt the team of coach Del Harris around center Vlade Divac , forward Cedric Ceballos , and guard Nick Van Exel , which won 48 games , and went to the Western Conference Semifinals ; for turning the team around , West received his first Executive of the Year Award . By trading Vlade Divac for Kobe Bryant , signing free agent center Shaquille O 'Neal , and signing six @-@ time NBA champion Phil Jackson as a coach , West laid down the <unk> of the Lakers three @-@ peat which saw L.A. win three NBA titles from 2000 to 2002 . 
 In 2002 , West became general manager of the Memphis Grizzlies . He explained his decision with the desire for exploring something new : " After being a part of the Lakers success for so many years , I have always wondered how it would be to build a winning franchise that has not experienced much success . I want to help make a difference . " West 's Memphis stint was not as spectacular as his Los Angeles stint , but he turned a franchise which was about to be sold into a reliable playoffs team , practically making no trades but getting the maximum from the players he had available ( e.g. Pau Gasol , James Posey and Jason Williams ) and signing coach Hubie Brown , who became Coach of the Year in 2004 . West himself won his second NBA Executive of the Year Award in the same year . At age 69 , West retired as a Grizzlies general manager in 2007 and turned over managing duties to Chris Wallace , from Buckhannon , West Virginia . 
 On May 19 , 2011 , West joined the Golden State Warriors as an executive board member , reporting directly to new owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber . This role also came with an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the team .

In 1979 , West was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame , and the Lakers retired his No. 44 jersey in 1983 . In March 2008 , ESPN voted West the third greatest shooting guard of all time . As a coach , West led the Lakers into three consecutive playoff campaigns , and then went on to win seven NBA championships as a general manager , building the 1980s Lakers dynasty under coach Pat Riley and players Magic Johnson , Kareem @-@ Abdul @-@ Jabbar and James Worthy and the 2000s under coach Phil Jackson and players Shaquille O 'Neal and Kobe Bryant . 
 In the summer of 2000 , the city of Morgantown , West Virginia , and West Virginia Governor Cecil Underwood , dedicated the road outside of the West Virginia University Coliseum , " Jerry West Boulevard " . The same road is shared on the south end of Morgantown with Don Knotts Boulevard , in honor of another WVU alumnus . Also , on November 26 , 2005 , his number 44 became the first basketball number to be retired by West Virginia University and on February 17 , 2007 , a bronze statue of him was honored outside of the WVU Coliseum . On February 17 , 2011 , a Jerry West statue was unveiled outside Staples Center at the Star Plaza in Los Angeles , California . Finally , the NBA logo itself is modelled after West 's silhouette .

 West was an all @-@ around combo guard who could take the playmaking roles of a point guard and score like a shooting guard , while being equally strong on offense and on defense . He had a jump shot with a release the NBA lauded as " lightning quick " , and was known for making baskets late in the game , earning him the nickname " Mr. Clutch " . Having played forward early in his career , West was also a capable rebounder , and gifted with long arms , quick hands and strong defensive instincts , West was also once described as one of the best ball hawks , man @-@ to @-@ man defenders and shot blockers among NBA guards : when the All @-@ Defensive Teams were introduced in 1969 , West made every one of them until his career ended in 1974 . " He stole more than anybody , although they didn 't keep records on it then , " said Sharman . However , contemporaries were most impressed by West 's work ethic , obsessively practicing and shooting and rarely being satisfied with himself . 
 West 's all @-@ round game and attitude is maybe best expressed in his statistically most spectacular game : he once was credited with 44 points ( 16 of 17 shots from the field , 12 of 12 free throw attempts ) with 12 rebounds , 12 assists and ( unofficially counted ) 10 blocked shots , thus scoring a non @-@ official ultra @-@ rare quadruple double . Instead of being proud , West merely commented : " Defensively , from a team standpoint , I didn 't feel I played very well . Very rarely was I satisfied with how I played . "

 West married his college sweetheart Martha Jane Kane in April 1960 in Morgantown ; they divorced in 1976 . They have three sons , David , Mark and Michael . Jerry married his current wife Karen in 1978 . They have two sons , Ryan and Jonnie . Jonnie played guard for West 's old team , the West Virginia Mountaineers . 
 As a person , West was often described as an introverted and nervous character , but who also drew highest praise for his uncompromising work ethic . Regarding his shyness , WVU room mate Jody Gardner testified that West never dated in his entire freshman year , and Lakers coach Fred Schaus once recalled a two @-@ week period when his guard never said a word . Apart from being shy , West was always restless : Schaus described him as a " bundle of nerves " , Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy as " always on the move " , and fellow Laker and Mountaineer Rod Hundley testified that during bar visits , West would quickly squirm and demand to go elsewhere before everybody else had settled . His first wife Martha Kane recalled that her husband often had difficulties opening up to her . After a big loss , the Wests would drive home and she would try to console him , but West would say " get out " at the home porch and drive away — an experience that " killed " her as a wife . 
 Early in his career , West 's West Virginian roots made him target for some mild jeering . He spoke with a high pitched voice that became even <unk> when he became excited , so that Lakers captain Elgin Baylor dubbed West " Tweety Bird " . His Appalachian accent was so thick that one coach interrupted him and asked him to speak English . Baylor once commented : " Rumors are safe with you , Tweety Bird . You pass them on , but nobody can understand you . " 
 West was also regarded for his extreme mental toughness and his exemplary work ethic . The NBA described West as " obsessive perfectionism , unabashed confidence , and an uncompromising will to win … a level of intensity so high it could melt lead " . Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn once said : " He took a loss harder than any player I 've ever known . He would sit by himself and stare into space . A loss just ripped his guts out . " Even before his sole championship in 1972 , the Lakers held a " Jerry West Night " , and eleven @-@ time NBA champion and perennial rival Bill Russell appeared and said : " Jerry , you are , in every sense of the word , truly a champion … If I could have one wish granted , it would be that you would always be happy . " 
 In 2011 , West wrote , along with bestselling author Jonathan Coleman , a memoir entitled West by West : My Charmed , Tormented Life , and revealed during an interview on HBO 's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel , that he was the victim of physical abuse from his father as a child , and has suffered from depression ever since . The book has had tremendous critical acclaim and became an instant New York Times bestseller .

 " Anasazi " is the twenty @-@ fifth episode and season finale of the second season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on May 19 , 1995 . It was written by series creator Chris Carter based on a story he developed with lead actor David Duchovny . The episode was directed by R. W. Goodwin , and featured guest appearances by Peter Donat , Nicholas Lea , Mitch Pileggi and Floyd Red Crow Westerman .

Meanwhile , Mulder 's mental health begins to deteriorate , and a mysterious corpse is discovered on a New Mexico reservation . " Anasazi " is part of a three @-@ episode storyline , with the plot carrying on in the third season episodes " The Blessing Way " and " Paper Clip " . 
 Series creator Chris Carter worked closely with series star David Duchovny , who shares a story credit with Carter for the episode . Because the series was filmed in Vancouver , the producers painted a disused quarry in Vancouver with 1 @,@ 600 gallons of red paint and also composited in images shot in New Mexico and a blue sky in order to make the New Mexico rock quarry featured in the episode .

 In the desert near a Navajo Indian reservation in Two Grey Hills , New Mexico , a teenage boy comes across a boxcar buried in the ground . He retrieves the corpse of an alien @-@ like figure from the boxcar , which he takes back to the reservation and presents it to the residents , including Navajo elder Albert Hosteen . 
 Shortly afterward , Kenneth Soona , a computer hacker known as " The Thinker " , breaks into the Defense Department database and downloads secret files related to extraterrestrial life , putting them onto a digital tape . When the Syndicate learns of the breach , the Smoking Man tells them that he has already resolved the matter . The Lone Gunmen meet with Mulder , and tell him that Soona requests to meet with him . While Mulder is leaving his apartment building , he finds that one of his neighbors has shot her husband . 
 Soona gives the digital cassette to Mulder at a discreet meeting in a park . An excited Mulder returns to FBI headquarters , only to find that the cassette is encrypted . Scully believes the encryption is based on the Navajo language and takes the tape in order to investigate . When Skinner calls Mulder to his office to question him about the tape , Mulder physically attacks him . Scully is brought before an FBI panel led by Skinner and is questioned about Mulder 's actions . Scully is told that Mulder faces dismissal from the FBI , and that she will suffer a similar punishment if she has lied to them . 
 On Martha 's Vineyard , the Smoking Man visits Mulder 's father , Bill , and informs him of his son 's likely possession of the tape . Scully meets with a Navajo translator , who refers her to a code talker . Mulder is called away to see Bill ; when Scully arrives at his apartment , she is grazed by a bullet shot through his window . When Mulder arrives at Bill 's residence , his father prepares to reveal the truth about everything . However , Bill is shot and mortally wounded by Alex Krycek . When Mulder contacts Scully , she tells him to flee the scene . After Mulder arrives at her apartment , Scully takes his gun from him while he sleeps . 
 Scully brings the gun to the FBI for comparison against the bullet that killed Bill . When Mulder awakens , he becomes angry and suspicious towards Scully . Later returning to his building , Scully finds his water being contaminated . When Mulder arrives home , he finds Krycek there and prepares to kill him . However , Scully shoots him to prevent him from doing so , allowing Krycek to escape . Scully brings an unconscious Mulder to New Mexico and , when he awakens , reveals that his behavior was caused by a drug placed into his water supply . She introduces him to Hosteen , who has been translating the files on the digital tape . 
 Scully reveals that the tape contains information on both her and Duane Barry . Hosteen introduces Mulder to his grandson , who drives him to the buried boxcar . Just before he heads in , he is called by the Smoking Man , who is able to trace Mulder 's location through the call .

 Series creator Chris Carter noted that the episode 's creation " was the culmination of a lot of ideas . Generally , when we pitch stories to the staff everyone comments on them , and Darin Morgan called this the kitchen sink episode , because it had so much in it , he didn 't know how we would pull it off . But I 'm very proud of the script . David Duchovny and I worked quite closely on the story and he had a lot of input , and then I sat down and wrote the script " . He felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible , asking more questions than it answered . The episode tried to make similar cliffhangers as the previous season finale , with revelations such as Mulder 's father being part of the conspiracy and later killed to " prove anything could happen in The X @-@ Files " . 
 To create the New Mexico rock quarry in this episode , the producers painted a disused quarry in Vancouver with 1 @,@ 600 gallons of red paint , and also composited images shot in New Mexico and a blue sky to make it look more authentic . The painting of the quarry was achieved with a series of cranes , and required the permission of local environmental groups . To create the impression of a buried train carriage , a depression had to be blown into the ground and thirty @-@ two dump trucks worth of debris removed . Series creator Chris Carter makes a cameo appearance in this episode as one of the senior FBI agents questioning Scully . The tagline for this episode is <unk> ' <unk> ' <unk> <unk> , which means " The Truth is Out There " in Navajo .

 In a retrospective of the second season in Entertainment Weekly , " Anasazi " was rated an A , being described as " mind @-@ blowing if frustrating " , with it being noted that the episode " made fans want to fast @-@ forward through summer . " Writing the A.V. Club , Zack Handlen rated the episode an A- , noting that the episode " has a lot of really strong moments " and praising Duchovny 's acting . However , he felt that the episode marked the point at which the series ' overarching mythology would begin to lose focus , explaining that " it 's troubling that instead of answering any big issues here ... the show only gives us new directions " . Chris Carter said of the episode , " I 'm proud of the way it came together , what it did for the series , and the overwhelmingly positive response it has gotten . I 'm very pleased beginning season three with where this episode put us — which is that it posed more questions than it answered . " He later said in 2005 that the episode brought a lot of interest to the show due to the apparent death of agent Mulder . The episode , along with both other parts of the story arc , were listed concurrently as the second @-@ best episode of the series by Den of Geek 's Nina Sordi . Sordi noted that the plotline " laid the groundwork for the mythology arc for the rest of the series " , adding that it " brought much more significance to what is to come " . 
 = Manhattan = 
 Manhattan ( / <unk> / , / <unk> / ) is the most densely populated borough of New York City , its economic and administrative center , and the city 's historical birthplace . The borough is coterminous with New York County , founded on November 1 , 1683 as one of the original counties of the U.S. state of New York . The borough consists mostly of Manhattan Island , bounded by the East , Hudson , and Harlem Rivers , and also includes several small adjacent islands and Marble Hill , a small neighborhood on the U.S. mainland . 
 Manhattan is often described as the cultural and financial capital of the world and hosts the United Nations Headquarters . Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan , New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world , and Manhattan is home to the world 's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization : the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ . Many multinational media conglomerates are based in the borough . Historically documented to have been purchased by Dutch colonists from Native Americans in 1626 , for 60 guilders or about $ 24 in 1626 and US $ 1050 today . Manhattan real estate has since become among the most expensive in the world , with the value of Manhattan Island , including real estate , estimated to exceed US $ 3 trillion in 2013 ; residential property sale prices in Manhattan typically exceeded US $ 1 @,@ 400 per square foot ( $ 15 @,@ 000 / m2 ) as of 2016 . 
 Although New York County is the United States ' second @-@ smallest county by land area ( larger only than <unk> County , Hawaii ) , it is also the most densely populated U.S. county . It is also one of the most densely populated areas in the world , with a census @-@ estimated 2015 population of 1 @,@ 644 @,@ 518 living in a land area of 22 @.@ 83 square miles ( 59 @.@ 13 km2 ) , or 72 @,@ 033 residents per square mile ( 27 @,@ 812 / km2 ) , higher than the density of any individual American city . On business days , the influx of commuters increases that number to over 3 @.@ 9 million , or more than 170 @,@ 000 people per square mile ( 65 @,@ 600 / km2 ) . Manhattan has the third @-@ largest population of New York City 's five boroughs , after Brooklyn and Queens , and is the smallest borough in terms of land area . 
 Many districts and landmarks in Manhattan have become well known , as New York City received a record of nearly 60 million tourists in 2015 , and Manhattan hosts three of the world 's 10 most @-@ visited tourist attractions in 2013 : Times Square , Central Park , and Grand Central Terminal . The borough hosts many world @-@ renowned bridges , such as the Brooklyn Bridge ; skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building , one of the tallest skyscrapers in the world ; and parks , such as Central Park . There are many historically significant places in Manhattan : Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere , and the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village is considered the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement . The City of New York was founded at the southern tip of Manhattan , and the borough houses New York City Hall , the seat of the City 's Government . Numerous colleges and universities are located in Manhattan , including Columbia University , New York University , and Rockefeller University , which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name " Manhattan " derives from the word Manna @-@ <unk> , as written in the 1609 logbook of Robert <unk> , an officer on Henry Hudson 's yacht Halve Maen ( Half Moon ) . A 1610 map depicts the name as Manna @-@ <unk> , twice , on both the west and east sides of the Mauritius River ( later named the Hudson River ) . The word " Manhattan " has been translated as " island of many hills " from the Lenape language . The United States Postal Service prefers that mail addressed to Manhattan use " New York , NY " rather than " Manhattan , NY " . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Colonial era = = = 
 The area that is now Manhattan was long inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans . In 1524 , Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano – sailing in service of King Francis I of France – was the first European to visit the area that would become New York City . He entered the tidal strait now known as The Narrows aboard his ship La Dauphine and named the land around Upper New York Harbor " New Angoulême " , in reference to the family name of King Francis I that was derived from Angoulême in France ; he sailed far enough into the harbor to sight the Hudson River , which he referred to in his report to the French king as a " very big river " ; and he named the Bay of Santa Margarita – what is now Upper New York Bay – after Marguerite de Navarre , the elder sister of the king . 
 It was not until the voyage of Henry Hudson , an Englishman who worked for the Dutch East India Company , that the area was mapped . Hudson came across Manhattan Island and the native people living there in 1609 , and continued up the river that would later bear his name , the Hudson River , until he arrived at the site of present day Albany . 
 A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624 with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors Island . In 1625 , construction was started on the citadel of Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island , later called New Amsterdam ( Nieuw Amsterdam ) , in what is now Lower Manhattan . The 1625 establishment of Fort Amsterdam at the southern tip of Manhattan Island is recognized as the birth of New York City . According to a letter by Pieter Janszoon <unk> , Peter Minuit and Dutch colonists acquired Manhattan on May 24 , 1626 from unnamed Native American people , which are believed to have been <unk> Indians of the Lenape , in exchange for trade goods worth 60 guilders , often said to be worth US $ 24 , although accounting for inflation , it actually amounts to around US $ 1 @,@ 050 in 2014 . According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley , Minuit conducted the transaction with <unk> , chief of the <unk> , who were only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for the island that was actually mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks . 
 In 1647 , Peter Stuyvesant was appointed as the last Dutch Director General of the colony . New Amsterdam was formally incorporated as a city on February 2 , 1653 . In 1664 , the English conquered New Netherland and renamed it " New York " after the English Duke of York and Albany , the future King James II . The Dutch , under Director General Stuyvesant , successfully negotiated with the English to produce 24 articles of provisional transfer , which sought to retain for the extant citizens of New Netherland their previously attained liberties ( including freedom of religion ) under new colonial English rulers . 
 The Dutch Republic regained it in August 1673 with a fleet of 21 ships , renaming the city " New Orange " . New Netherland was ceded permanently to the English in November 1674 through the Treaty of Westminster , in exchange for Run Island which was the long @-@ coveted last link in the Dutch nutmeg trading monopoly in Indonesia . 
 = = = American Revolution and the early United States = = = 
 Manhattan was at the heart of the New York Campaign , a series of major battles in the early American Revolutionary War . The Continental Army was forced to abandon Manhattan after the Battle of Fort Washington on November 16 , 1776 . The city became the British political and military center of operations in North America for the remainder of the war . Manhattan was greatly damaged by the Great Fire of New York during the British military rule that followed . British occupation lasted until November 25 , 1783 , when George Washington returned to Manhattan , as the last British forces left the city . 
 From January 11 , 1785 , to the fall of 1788 , New York City was the fifth of five capitals of the United States under the Articles of Confederation , with the Continental Congress meeting at New York City Hall ( then at Fraunces Tavern ) . New York was the first capital under the newly enacted Constitution of the United States , from March 4 , 1789 , to August 12 , 1790 , at Federal Hall . Federal Hall was also the site of where the United States Supreme Court met for the first time , the United States Bill of Rights were drafted and ratified , and where the Northwest Ordinance was adopted , establishing measures for adding new states to the Union .

 New York grew as an economic center , first as a result of Alexander Hamilton 's policies and practices as the first Secretary of the Treasury and , later , with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 , which connected the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the Midwestern United States and Canada . By 1810 New York City , then confined to Manhattan , had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States . 
 Tammany Hall , a Democratic Party political machine , began to grow in influence with the support of many of the immigrant Irish , culminating in the election of the first Tammany mayor , Fernando Wood , in 1854 . Tammany Hall dominated local politics for decades . Central Park , which opened to the public in 1858 , became the first landscaped public park in an American city . 
 New York City played a complex role in the American Civil War . The city 's strong commercial ties to the American South , its growing immigrant population ( prior to then largely from Germany and Ireland ; beginning in the late 1850s waves of Italian ; and Central , and Eastern European Jews began flowing in en @-@ masse ) , anger about conscription <unk> and resentment at those who could afford to pay $ 300 to avoid service , led to resentment against Lincoln 's war policies , plus the racial element , fomented paranoia about free Blacks taking the poor immigrants ' jobs , culminated in the three @-@ day @-@ long New York Draft Riots of July 1863 . These intense war @-@ time riots are counted among the worst incidents of civil disorder in American history , with an estimated 119 participants and passersby massacred . 
 The rate of immigration from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War , and New York became the first stop for millions seeking a new life in the United States , a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty on October 28 , 1886 , a gift from the people of France . The new European immigration brought further social upheaval . In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations , the city was a hotbed of revolution ( including anarchists and communists among others ) , syndicalism , racketeering , and unionization . 
 In 1883 , the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge established a road connection to Brooklyn , across the East River . In 1874 , the western portion of the present Bronx County was transferred to New York County from Westchester County , and in 1895 the remainder of the present Bronx County was annexed . In 1898 , when New York City consolidated with three neighboring counties to form " the City of Greater New York " , Manhattan and the Bronx , though still one county , were established as two separate boroughs . On January 1 , 1914 , the New York state legislature created Bronx County , and New York County was reduced to its present boundaries .

 The construction of the New York City Subway , which opened in 1904 , helped bind the new city together , as did additional bridges to Brooklyn . In the 1920s , Manhattan experienced large arrivals of African @-@ Americans as part of the Great Migration from the southern United States , and the Harlem Renaissance , part of a larger boom time in the Prohibition era that included new skyscrapers competing for the skyline . New York City became the most populous city in the world in 1925 , overtaking London , which had reigned for a century . Manhattan 's majority white ethnic group declined from 98 @.@ 7 % in 1900 to 58 @.@ 3 % by 1990 . 
 On March 25 , 1911 , the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Greenwich Village killed 146 garment workers . The disaster eventually led to overhauls of the city 's fire department , building codes , and workplace regulations . 
 The period between the World Wars saw the election of reformist mayor Fiorello La Guardia and the fall of Tammany Hall after 80 years of political dominance . As the city 's demographics stabilized , labor unionization brought new protections and affluence to the working class , the city 's government and infrastructure underwent a dramatic overhaul under La Guardia . Despite the Great Depression , some of the world 's tallest skyscrapers were completed in Manhattan during the 1930s , including numerous Art Deco masterpieces that are still part of the city 's skyline today , most notably the Empire State Building , the Chrysler Building , and the GE Building . 
 Returning World War II veterans created a postwar economic boom , which led to the development of huge housing developments targeted at returning veterans , the largest being Peter Cooper Village @-@ Stuyvesant Town , which opened in 1947 . In 1952 , the UN relocated from its first headquarters near Queens , to the East Side of Manhattan . 
 The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous , violent demonstrations by members of the gay community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28 , 1969 , at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan . They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States . 
 In the 1970s , job losses due to industrial restructuring caused New York City , including Manhattan , to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates . While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city 's economic health in the 1980s , New York 's crime rate continued to increase through the decade and into the beginning of the 1990s . 
 The 1980s saw a rebirth of Wall Street , and Manhattan reclaimed its role at the center of the worldwide financial industry . The 1980s also saw Manhattan at the heart of the AIDS crisis , with Greenwich Village at its epicenter . The organizations Gay Men 's Health Crisis ( <unk> ) and AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ( ACT UP ) were founded to advocate on behalf of those stricken with the disease . 
 By the 1990s , crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies , improving economic opportunities , gentrification , and new residents , both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America . Murder rates that had reached 2 @,@ 245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008 , and the crack epidemic and its associated drug @-@ related violence came under greater control . The outflow of population turned around , as the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world , joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel the growth of the real estate market . Important new sectors , such as Silicon Alley , emerged in Manhattan 's economy .

 On September 11 , 2001 , two of four hijacked planes were flown into the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center , and the towers subsequently collapsed . 7 World Trade Center collapsed due to fires and structural damage caused by heavy debris falling from the collapse of the Twin Towers . The other buildings within the World Trade Center complex were damaged beyond repair and soon after demolished . The collapse of the Twin Towers caused extensive damage to other surrounding buildings and skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan , and resulted in the deaths of 2 @,@ 606 people , in addition to those on the planes . Since 2001 , most of Lower Manhattan has been restored , but there has been controversy surrounding the rebuilding . However , many rescue workers and residents of the area developed several life @-@ threatening illnesses that have led to some of their subsequent deaths . A memorial at the site was opened to the public on September 11 , 2011 , and the museum opened in 2014 . In 2014 , the new One World Trade Center , at 1 @,@ 776 feet ( 541 m ) and formerly known as the Freedom Tower , became the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere , while other skyscrapers were under construction at the site . 
 The Occupy Wall Street protests in Zuccotti Park in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan began on September 17 , 2011 , receiving global attention and spawning the Occupy movement against social and economic inequality worldwide . 
 On October 29 and 30 , 2012 , Hurricane Sandy caused extensive destruction in the borough , ravaging portions of Lower Manhattan with record @-@ high storm surge from New York Harbor , severe flooding , and high winds , causing power outages for hundreds of thousands of city residents and leading to gasoline shortages and disruption of mass transit systems . The storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the borough and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future .

 The borough consists of Manhattan Island , Marble Hill , and several small islands , including Randalls Island and Wards Island , and Roosevelt Island in the East River , and Governors Island and Liberty Island to the south in New York Harbor . 
 According to the U.S. Census Bureau , New York County has a total area of 33 @.@ 6 square miles ( 87 km2 ) , of which 22 @.@ 8 square miles ( 59 km2 ) is land and 10 @.@ 8 square miles ( 28 km2 ) ( 32 % ) is water . The northern segment of Upper Manhattan represents a geographic panhandle . Manhattan Island is 22 @.@ 7 square miles ( 59 km2 ) in area , 13 @.@ 4 miles ( 21 @.@ 6 km ) long and 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) wide , at its widest ( near 14th Street ) . 
 = = = = Manhattan Island = = = = 
 Manhattan Island is loosely divided into Downtown ( Lower Manhattan ) , Midtown ( Midtown Manhattan ) , and Uptown ( Upper Manhattan ) , with Fifth Avenue dividing Manhattan 's east and west sides . Manhattan Island is bounded by the Hudson River to the west and the East River to the east . To the north , the Harlem River divides Manhattan Island from the Bronx and the mainland United States . 
 Early in the 19th century , landfill was used to expand Lower Manhattan from the natural Hudson shoreline at Greenwich Street to West Street . When building the World Trade Center in 1968 , 1 @.@ 2 million cubic yards ( 917 @,@ 000 m ³ ) of material was excavated from the site . Rather than dumping the spoil at sea or in landfills , the fill material was used to expand the Manhattan shoreline across West Street , creating Battery Park City . The result was a 700 @-@ foot ( 210 @-@ m ) extension into the river , running six blocks or 1 @,@ 484 feet ( 452 m ) , covering 92 acres ( 37 ha ) , providing a 1 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 9 km ) riverfront esplanade and over 30 acres ( 12 ha ) of parks . 
 = = = = Marble Hill = = = = 
 One neighborhood of New York County is contiguous with the mainland . Marble Hill at one time was part of Manhattan Island , but the Harlem River Ship Canal , dug in 1895 to improve navigation on the Harlem River , separated it from the remainder of Manhattan as an island between the Bronx and the remainder of Manhattan . Before World War I , the section of the original Harlem River channel separating Marble Hill from The Bronx was filled in , and Marble Hill became part of the mainland . 
 Marble Hill is one example of how Manhattan 's land has been considerably altered by human intervention . The borough has seen substantial land reclamation along its waterfronts since Dutch colonial times , and much of the natural variation in its topography has been evened out .

 In New York Harbor there are three smaller islands : 
 Ellis Island , shared with New Jersey 
 Governors Island 
 Liberty Island 
 Other smaller islands , in the East River , include ( from north to south ) : 
 Randalls and Wards Islands , joined by landfill 
 Mill Rock 
 Roosevelt Island 
 U Thant Island ( legally Belmont Island ) 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 = = = = Bedrock = = = = 
 The bedrock underlying much of Manhattan is a mica schist known as Manhattan schist . It is a strong , competent metamorphic rock created when Pangaea formed . It is well suited for the foundations of tall buildings . In Central Park , outcrops of Manhattan Schist occur and Rat Rock is one rather large example . 
 Geologically , a predominant feature of the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near Midtown Manhattan , dips down lower between 29th Street and Canal Street , then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan . It has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and Financial District areas , and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas . However , research has shown that economic factors played a bigger part in the locations of these skyscrapers . 
 = = = = Updated seismic analysis = = = = 
 According to the United States Geological Survey , an updated analysis of seismic hazard in July 2014 revealed a " slightly lower hazard for tall buildings " in Manhattan than previously assessed . Scientists estimated this lessened risk based upon a lower likelihood than previously thought of slow shaking near New York City , which would be more likely to cause damage to taller structures from an earthquake in the vicinity of the city .

 = = = = Neighborhoods = = = = 
 Manhattan 's many neighborhoods are not named according to any particular convention . Some are geographical ( the Upper East Side ) , or ethnically descriptive ( Little Italy ) . Others are acronyms , such as TriBeCa ( for " <unk> <unk> <unk> Street " ) or SoHo ( " <unk> of <unk> " ) , or the far more recent vintages <unk> ( " <unk> of Little <unk> " ) . and <unk> ( " <unk> of <unk> Square Park " ) . Harlem is a name from the Dutch colonial era after Haarlem , a city in the Netherlands . Alphabet City comprises Avenues A , B , C , and D , to which its name refers . Some have simple folkloric names , such as Hell 's Kitchen , alongside their more official but lesser used title ( in this case , Clinton ) . 
 Some neighborhoods , such as SoHo , are commercial and known for upscale shopping . Others , such as Greenwich Village , the Lower East Side , Alphabet City and the East Village , have long been associated with the Bohemian subculture . Chelsea is a neighborhood with a large gay population , and recently a center of New York 's art industry and nightlife . Washington Heights is a vibrant neighborhood of immigrants from the Dominican Republic . Chinatown has a dense population of people of Chinese descent . <unk> is roughly bounded by 5th and 6th Avenues , between 31st and 36th Streets . Rose Hill features a growing number of Indian restaurants and spice shops along a stretch of Lexington Avenue between 25th and 30th Streets which has become known as Curry Hill . 
 In Manhattan , uptown means north ( more precisely north @-@ northeast , which is the direction the island and its street grid system is oriented ) and downtown means south ( south @-@ southwest ) . This usage differs from that of most American cities , where downtown refers to the central business district . Manhattan has two central business districts , the Financial District at the southern tip of the island , and Midtown Manhattan . The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and downtown to the southern portion below 14th Street , with Midtown covering the area in between , though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation . 
 Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island and acts as the demarcation line for east / west designations ( e.g. , East 27th Street , West 42nd Street ) ; street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue , at a rate of 100 per block on most streets . South of Waverly Place , Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east / west demarcation line . Though the grid does start with 1st Street , just north of Houston Street ( the southernmost street divided in west and east portions ; pronounced <unk> @-@ stin ) , the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street , where nearly all east @-@ west streets are numerically identified , which increase from south to north to 220th Street , the highest numbered street on the island . Streets in Midtown are usually one way with a few exceptions ( 14th , 23rd , 34th , and 42nd for example ) . The rule of thumb is that odd @-@ numbered streets run west , while even @-@ numbered streets run east . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Under the Köppen climate classification , using the 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) coldest month ( January ) isotherm , New York City including Manhattan itself experiences a humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ) , and located at around 40 ° N latitude , is the northernmost major city on the North American continent with this categorization . Winters are cold and damp , and prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the moderating effects of the Atlantic Ocean ; yet the Atlantic and the partial shielding from colder air by the Appalachians keep the city warmer in the winter than inland North American cities at similar or lesser latitudes , such as Pittsburgh , Cincinnati , and Indianapolis , helping to moderate the amount of snow , which averages 25 inches ( 64 cm ) each year . Spring and fall in New York City are mild , while summer is very warm and humid , with temperatures of 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) or higher recorded from 18 to 25 days on average during the season . The city 's long @-@ term climate patterns are affected by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation , a 70 @-@ year @-@ long warming and cooling cycle in the Atlantic that influences the frequency and severity of hurricanes and coastal storms in the region . Central Park is the location of record for the borough 's climatic data . 
 Temperature records have been set as high as 106 ° F ( 41 ° C ) on July 9 , 1936 , and as low as − 15 ° F ( − 26 ° C ) on February 9 , 1934 . 
 Summer evening temperatures are elevated by the urban heat island effect , which causes heat absorbed during the day to be radiated back at night , raising temperatures by as much as 7 ° F ( 4 ° C ) when winds are slow .

 = = = Architectural history = = = 
 The skyscraper , which has shaped Manhattan 's distinctive skyline , has been closely associated with New York City 's identity since the end of the 19th century . From 1890 to 1973 , the world 's tallest building was in Manhattan ( with a gap between 1901 and 1908 , when the title was held by Philadelphia City Hall ) , with nine different buildings holding the title . The New York World Building on Park Row , was the first to take the title in 1890 , standing 309 feet ( 94 m ) until 1955 , when it was demolished to construct a new ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge . The nearby Park Row Building , with its 29 stories standing 391 feet ( 119 m ) high took the title in 1899 . The 41 @-@ story Singer Building , constructed in 1908 as the headquarters of the eponymous sewing machine manufacturer , stood 612 feet ( 187 m ) high until 1967 , when it became the tallest building ever demolished . The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower , standing 700 feet ( 210 m ) at the foot of Madison Avenue , wrested the title in 1909 , with a tower reminiscent of St Mark 's Campanile in Venice . The Woolworth Building , and its distinctive Gothic architecture , took the title in 1913 , topping off at 792 feet ( 241 m ) . 
 The Roaring Twenties saw a race to the sky , with three separate buildings pursuing the world 's tallest title in the span of a year . As the stock market soared in the days before the Wall Street Crash of 1929 , two developers publicly competed for the crown . At 927 feet ( 283 m ) , 40 Wall Street , completed in May 1930 in an astonishing eleven months as the headquarters of the Bank of Manhattan , seemed to have secured the title . At Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street , auto executive Walter Chrysler and his architect William Van Alen developed plans to build the structure 's trademark 185 @-@ foot ( 56 m ) high spire in secret , pushing the Chrysler Building to 1 @,@ 046 feet ( 319 m ) and making it the tallest in the world when it was completed in 1929 . Both buildings were soon surpassed , with the May 1931 completion of the 102 @-@ story Empire State Building with its Art Deco tower soaring 1 @,@ 250 feet ( 380 m ) to the top of the building . The 203 @-@ foot ( 62 m ) high pinnacle was later added bringing the total height of the building to 1 @,@ 453 ft ( 443 m ) . 
 The former Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were located in Lower Manhattan . At 1 @,@ 368 and 1 @,@ 362 feet ( 417 and 415 m ) , the 110 @-@ story buildings were the world 's tallest from 1972 , until they were surpassed by the construction of the Willis Tower in 1974 ( formerly known as the Sears Tower , located in Chicago ) . One World Trade Center , a replacement for the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center , is currently the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere . 
 In 1961 , the Pennsylvania Railroad unveiled plans to tear down the old Penn Station and replace it with a new Madison Square Garden and office building complex . Organized protests were aimed at preserving the McKim , Mead & White @-@ designed structure completed in 1910 , widely considered a masterpiece of the Beaux @-@ Arts style and one of the architectural jewels of New York City . Despite these efforts , demolition of the structure began in October 1963 . The loss of Penn Station — called " an act of irresponsible public vandalism " by historian Lewis Mumford — led directly to the enactment in 1965 of a local law establishing the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission , which is responsible for preserving the " city 's historic , aesthetic , and cultural heritage " . The historic preservation movement triggered by Penn Station 's demise has been credited with the retention of some one million structures nationwide , including nearly 1 @,@ 000 in New York City .

 Central Park is bordered on the north by West 110th Street , on the west by Eighth Avenue , on the south by West 59th Street , and on the east by Fifth Avenue . Along the park 's borders , these streets are usually referred to as Central Park North , Central Park West , and Central Park South , respectively ( Fifth Avenue retains its name along the eastern border ) . The park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux . The 843 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 41 km2 ) park offers extensive walking tracks , two ice @-@ skating rinks , a wildlife sanctuary , and grassy areas used for various sporting pursuits , as well as playgrounds for children . The park is a popular oasis for migrating birds , and thus is popular with bird watchers . The 6 @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) road circling the park is popular with joggers , bicyclists and inline skaters , especially on weekends and in the evenings after 7 : 00 pm , when automobile traffic is banned . While much of the park looks natural , it is almost entirely landscaped and contains several artificial lakes . The construction of Central Park in the 1850s was one of the era 's most massive public works projects . Some 20 @,@ 000 workers crafted the topography to create the English @-@ style pastoral landscape Olmsted and Vaux sought to create .

 Manhattan has been the scene of many important American cultural movements . In 1912 , about 20 @,@ 000 workers , a quarter of them women , marched upon Washington Square Park to commemorate the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire , which killed 146 workers on March 25 , 1911 . Many of the women wore fitted tucked @-@ front blouses like those manufactured by the Triangle Shirtwaist Company , a clothing style that became the working woman 's uniform and a symbol of women 's liberation , reflecting the alliance of labor and suffrage movements . 
 The Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s established the African @-@ American literary canon in the United States . Manhattan 's vibrant visual art scene in the 1950s and 1960s was a center of the American pop art movement , which gave birth to such giants as Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein . Perhaps no other artist is as associated with the downtown pop art movement of the late 1970s as Andy Warhol , who socialized at clubs like Serendipity 3 and Studio 54 . 
 Broadway theatre is often considered the highest professional form of theatre in the United States . Plays and musicals are staged in one of the 39 larger professional theatres with at least 500 seats , almost all in and around Times Square .

 Manhattan is the borough most closely associated with New York City by non @-@ residents ; even some natives of New York City 's boroughs outside Manhattan will describe a trip to Manhattan as " going to the city " . 
 The borough has a place in several American idioms . The phrase a New York minute is meant to convey a very short time , sometimes in hyperbolic form , as in " perhaps faster than you would believe is possible " . It refers to the rapid pace of life in Manhattan . The term " melting pot " was first popularly coined to describe the densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side in Israel <unk> 's play The Melting Pot , which was an adaptation of William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet set by <unk> in New York City in 1908 . The iconic Flatiron Building is said to have been the source of the phrase " 23 <unk> " or scram , from what cops would shout at men who tried to get glimpses of women 's dresses being blown up by the winds created by the triangular building . The " Big Apple " dates back to the 1920s , when a reporter heard the term used by New Orleans <unk> to refer to New York City 's racetracks and named his racing column " Around The Big Apple . " Jazz musicians adopted the term to refer to the city as the world 's jazz capital , and a 1970s ad campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau helped popularize the term .

 Manhattan is home to the NBA 's New York Knicks , the NHL 's New York Rangers , and the WNBA 's New York Liberty , who all play their home games at Madison Square Garden , the only major professional sports arena in the borough . The New York Jets proposed a West Side Stadium for their home field , but the proposal was eventually defeated in June 2005 , leaving them at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford , New Jersey . 
 Today , Manhattan is the only borough in New York City that does not have a professional baseball franchise . The Bronx has the Yankees ( American League ) and Queens has the Mets ( National League ) of Major League Baseball . The Minor League Baseball Brooklyn Cyclones play in Brooklyn , while the Staten Island Yankees play in Staten Island . Yet three of the four major league teams to play in New York City played in Manhattan . The New York Giants played in the various incarnations of the Polo Grounds at 155th Street and Eighth Avenue from their inception in 1883 — except for 1889 , when they split their time between Jersey City and Staten Island , and when they played in Hilltop Park in 1911 — until they headed west with the Brooklyn Dodgers after the 1957 season . The New York Yankees began their franchise as the Highlanders , named for Hilltop Park , where they played from their creation in 1903 until 1912 . The team moved to the Polo Grounds with the 1913 season , where they were officially christened the New York Yankees , remaining there until they moved across the Harlem River in 1923 to Yankee Stadium . The New York Mets played in the Polo Grounds in 1962 and 1963 , their first two seasons , before Shea Stadium was completed in 1964 . After the Mets departed , the Polo Grounds was demolished in April 1964 , replaced by public housing . 
 The first national college @-@ level basketball championship , the National Invitation Tournament , was held in New York in 1938 and remains in the city . The New York Knicks started play in 1946 as one of the National Basketball Association 's original teams , playing their first home games at the 69th Regiment Armory , before making Madison Square Garden their permanent home . The New York Liberty of the WNBA have shared the Garden with the Knicks since their creation in 1997 as one of the league 's original eight teams . Rucker Park in Harlem is a playground court , famed for its <unk> style of play , where many NBA athletes have played in the summer league . 
 Though both of New York City 's football teams play today across the Hudson River in MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford , New Jersey , both teams started out playing in the Polo Grounds . The New York Giants played side @-@ by @-@ side with their baseball namesakes from the time they entered the National Football League in 1925 , until crossing over to Yankee Stadium in 1956 . The New York Jets , originally known as the Titans , started out in 1960 at the Polo Grounds , staying there for four seasons before joining the Mets in Queens in 1964 . 
 The New York Rangers of the National Hockey League have played in the various locations of Madison Square Garden since their founding in the 1926 – 1927 season . The Rangers were predated by the New York Americans , who started play in the Garden the previous season , lasting until the team folded after the 1941 – 1942 NHL season , a season it played in the Garden as the Brooklyn Americans . 
 The New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League played their home games at Downing Stadium for two seasons , starting in 1974 . In 1975 , the team signed Pelé , officially recorded by FIFA as the world 's greatest soccer player , to a $ 4 @.@ 5 million contract , drawing a capacity crowd of 22 @,@ 500 to watch him lead the team to a 2 – 0 victory . The playing pitch and facilities at Downing Stadium were in dreadful condition though and as the team 's popularity grew they too left for Yankee Stadium , and then Giants Stadium . The stadium was demolished in 2002 to make way for the $ 45 million , 4 @,@ 754 @-@ seat Icahn Stadium , which includes an Olympic @-@ standard 400 @-@ meter running track and , as part of Pele 's and the Cosmos ' legacy , includes a FIFA @-@ approved floodlit soccer stadium that hosts matches between the 48 youth teams of a Manhattan soccer club . 
 = = Government = = 
 Since New York City 's consolidation in 1898 , Manhattan has been governed by the New York City Charter , which has provided for a strong mayor @-@ council system since its revision in 1989 . The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education , correctional institutions , libraries , public safety , recreational facilities , sanitation , water supply , and welfare services in Manhattan . 
 The office of Borough President was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority . Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the New York City Board of Estimate , which was responsible for creating and approving the city 's budget and proposals for land use . In 1989 the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional because Brooklyn , the most populous borough , had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island , the least populous borough , a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to the high court 's 1964 " one man , one vote " decision . 
 Since 1990 , the largely powerless Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies , the City Council , the New York state government , and corporations . Manhattan 's current Borough President is Gale Brewer , elected as a Democrat in November 2013 with 82 @.@ 9 % of the vote . Brewer replaced Scott Stringer , who went on to become New York City Comptroller . 
 Cyrus Vance , a Democrat , has been the District Attorney of New York County since 2010 . Manhattan has ten City Council members , the third largest contingent among the five boroughs . It also has twelve administrative districts , each served by a local Community Board . Community Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates for local residents . As the host of the UN , the borough is home to the world 's largest international consular corps , comprising 105 consulates , consulates general and honorary consulates . It is also the home of New York City Hall , the seat of New York City government housing the Mayor of New York City and the New York City Council . The mayor 's staff and thirteen municipal agencies are located in the nearby Manhattan Municipal Building , completed in 1916 , one of the largest governmental buildings in the world .

 The Democratic Party holds most public offices . Registered Republicans are a minority in the borough , only constituting approximately 12 % of the electorate . Registered Republicans are more than 20 % of the electorate only in the neighborhoods of the Upper East Side and the Financial District . The Democrats hold 66 @.@ 1 % of those registered in a party . 21 @.@ 9 % of the voters were unaffiliated ( independents ) . 
 Manhattan is divided between three congressional districts , all of which are represented by Democrats . 
 Jerrold Nadler represents the 8th district , based on the West Side , which covers most of the Upper West Side , Hell 's Kitchen , Chelsea , Greenwich Village , Chinatown , Tribeca and Battery Park City , as well as some sections of Southwest Brooklyn . 
 Carolyn B. Maloney represents the 14th district , the so @-@ called " Silk Stocking " district that was the political base for Teddy Roosevelt and John Lindsay . It covers most of the Upper East Side , Yorkville , Gramercy Park , Roosevelt Island and most of the Lower East Side and the East Village , as well as portions of western Queens . 
 Nydia Velázquez of the Brooklyn / Queens @-@ based 12th district , represents a few heavily Puerto Rican sections of the Lower East Side , including Avenues C and D of Alphabet City . 
 No Republican has won the presidential election in Manhattan since 1924 , when Calvin Coolidge won a plurality of the New York County vote over Democrat John W. Davis , 41 @.@ 20 % – 39 @.@ 55 % . Warren G. Harding was the most recent Republican presidential candidate to win a majority of the Manhattan vote , with 59 @.@ 22 % of the 1920 vote . In the 2004 presidential election , Democrat John Kerry received 82 @.@ 1 % of the vote in Manhattan and Republican George W. Bush received 16 @.@ 7 % . The borough is the most important source of funding for presidential campaigns in the United States ; in 2004 , it was home to six of the top seven ZIP codes in the nation for political contributions . The top ZIP code , <unk> on the Upper East Side , generated the most money for the United States presidential election for all presidential candidates , including both Kerry and Bush during the 2004 election .

 Starting in the mid @-@ 19th century , the United States became a magnet for immigrants seeking to escape poverty in their home countries . After arriving in New York , many new arrivals ended up living in squalor in the slums of the Five Points neighborhood , an area between Broadway and the Bowery , northeast of New York City Hall . By the 1820s , the area was home to many gambling dens and brothels , and was known as a dangerous place to go . In 1842 , Charles Dickens visited the area and was appalled at the horrendous living conditions he had seen . The area was so notorious that it even caught the attention of Abraham Lincoln , who visited the area before his Cooper Union speech in 1860 . The predominantly Irish Five Points Gang was one of the country 's first major organized crime entities . 
 As Italian immigration grew in the early 20th century many joined ethnic gangs , including Al Capone , who got his start in crime with the Five Points Gang . The Mafia ( also known as Cosa Nostra ) first developed in the mid @-@ 19th century in Sicily and spread to the East Coast of the United States during the late 19th century following waves of Sicilian and Southern Italian emigration . Lucky Luciano established Cosa Nostra in Manhattan , forming alliances with other criminal enterprises , including the Jewish mob , led by Meyer Lansky , the leading Jewish gangster of that period . From 1920 – 1933 , Prohibition helped create a thriving black market in liquor , upon which the Mafia was quick to capitalize . 
 As in the whole of New York City , Manhattan experienced a sharp increase in crime during the 1960s and 1970s . Since 1990 , crime in Manhattan has plummeted in all categories tracked by the <unk> profile . A borough that saw 503 murders in 1990 has seen a drop of nearly 88 % to 62 in 2008 . Robbery and burglary are down by more than 80 % during the period , and auto theft has been reduced by more than 93 % . In the seven major crime categories tracked by the system , overall crime has declined by more than 75 % since 1990 , and year @-@ to @-@ date statistics through May 2009 show continuing declines . Based on 2005 data , New York City has the lowest crime rate among the ten largest cities in the United States . 
 = = Housing = = 
 During Manhattan 's early history , wood construction and poor access to water supplies left the city vulnerable to fires . In 1776 , shortly after the Continental Army evacuated Manhattan and left it to the British , a massive fire broke out destroying one @-@ third of the city and some 500 houses . 
 The rise of immigration near the turn of the 20th century left major portions of Manhattan , especially the Lower East Side , densely packed with recent arrivals , crammed into unhealthy and unsanitary housing . <unk> were usually five @-@ stories high , constructed on the then @-@ typical <unk> lots , with " cockroach landlords " exploiting the new immigrants . By 1929 , stricter fire codes and the increased use of elevators in residential buildings , were the impetus behind a new housing code that effectively ended the tenement as a form of new construction , though many tenement buildings survive today on the East Side of the borough . 
 Manhattan offers a wide array of public and private housing options . There were 852 @,@ 575 housing units in 2013 at an average density of 37 @,@ 345 per square mile ( 14 @,@ 419 / km ² ) . As of 2003 , only 20 @.@ 3 % of Manhattan residents lived in owner @-@ occupied housing , the second @-@ lowest rate of all counties in the nation , behind the Bronx . Although the city of New York has the highest average cost for rent in the United States , it simultaneously hosts a higher average of income per capita . Because of this , rent is a lower percentage of annual income than in several other American cities . 
 As of 2012 , Manhattan 's real estate market for luxury housing was among the most expensive in the world .

 Manhattan is unique in the U.S. for intense use of public transportation and lack of private car ownership . While 88 % of Americans nationwide drive to their jobs , with only 5 % using public transport , mass transit is the dominant form of travel for residents of Manhattan , with 72 % of borough residents using public transport to get to work , while only 18 % drove . According to the 2000 United States Census , 77 @.@ 5 % of Manhattan households do not own a car . 
 In 2008 , Mayor Bloomberg proposed a congestion pricing system to regulate entering Manhattan south of 60th Street . The state legislature rejected the proposal in June 2008 . 
 The New York City Subway , the largest subway system in the world by number of stations , is the primary means of travel within the city , linking every borough except Staten Island . There are 148 subway stations in Manhattan and four under construction , out of the 469 stations . A second subway , the Port Authority Trans @-@ Hudson ( PATH ) system , connects six stations in Manhattan to northern New Jersey . Passengers pay fares with pay @-@ per @-@ ride MetroCards , which are valid on all city buses and subways , as well as on PATH trains . There are 7 @-@ day and 30 @-@ day MetroCards that allow unlimited trips on all subways ( except PATH ) and MTA bus routes ( except for express buses ) . The PATH <unk> is being phased out , having been replaced by the <unk> . The MTA is testing " smart card " payment systems to replace the MetroCard . Commuter rail services operating to and from Manhattan are the Long Island Rail Road ( which connects Manhattan and other New York City boroughs to Long Island ) , the Metro @-@ North Railroad ( which connects Manhattan to Upstate New York and Southwestern Connecticut ) and NJ Transit trains to various points in New Jersey . <unk> @-@ dollar heavy @-@ rail transit projects under construction in Manhattan include the Second Avenue Subway , the East Side Access project , and the World Trade Center Transportation Hub .

 MTA New York City Transit offers a wide variety of local buses within Manhattan under the brand New York City Bus . An extensive network of express bus routes serves commuters and other travelers heading into Manhattan . The bus system served 784 million passengers citywide in 2011 , placing the bus system 's ridership as the highest in the nation , and more than double the ridership of the second @-@ place Los Angeles system . 
 The Roosevelt Island Tramway , one of two commuter cable car systems in North America , whisks commuters between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan in less than five minutes , and has been serving the island since 1978 . ( The other system in North America is the Portland Aerial Tram . ) The Staten Island Ferry , which runs 24 hours a day , 365 days a year , annually carries over 21 million passengers on the 5 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 4 km ) run between Manhattan and Staten Island .

 The Commissioners ' Plan of 1811 called for twelve numbered avenues running north and south roughly parallel to the shore of the Hudson River , each 100 feet ( 30 m ) wide , with First Avenue on the east side and Twelfth Avenue on the west side . There are several intermittent avenues east of First Avenue , including four additional lettered avenues running from Avenue A eastward to Avenue D in an area now known as Alphabet City in Manhattan 's East Village . The numbered streets in Manhattan run east @-@ west , and are generally 60 feet ( 18 m ) wide , with about 200 feet ( 61 m ) between each pair of streets . With each combined street and block adding up to about 260 feet ( 79 m ) , there are almost exactly 20 blocks per mile . The typical block in Manhattan is 250 by 600 feet ( 76 by 183 m ) . 
 According to the original Commissioner 's Plan , there were 155 numbered crosstown streets , but later the grid was extended up to the northernmost corner of Manhattan , where the last numbered street is 220th Street ( Manhattan ) . Moreover , the numbering system continues even in The Bronx , north of Manhattan , despite the fact that the grid plan is not so regular there , and the last numbered street is 263rd Street . Fifteen crosstown streets were designated as 100 feet ( 30 m ) wide , including 34th , 42nd , 57th and 125th Streets , which became some of the borough 's most significant transportation and shopping venues . Broadway is the most notable of many exceptions to the grid , starting at Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan and continuing north into the Bronx at Manhattan 's northern tip . In much of Midtown Manhattan , Broadway runs at a diagonal to the grid , creating major named intersections at Union Square ( Park Avenue South / Fourth Avenue and 14th Street ) , Madison Square ( Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street ) , Herald Square ( Sixth Avenue and 34th Street ) , Times Square ( Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street ) , and Columbus Circle ( Eighth Avenue / Central Park West and 59th Street ) . 
 " Crosstown traffic " refers primarily to vehicular traffic between Manhattan 's East Side and Manhattan 's West Side . The trip is notoriously frustrating for drivers because of heavy congestion on narrow local streets laid out by the Commissioners ' Plan of 1811 , absence of express roads other than the Trans @-@ Manhattan Expressway at the far north end of Manhattan Island , and only 4 crosstown roads for travel through Central Park , which is between 59th Street and 110th Street . Proposals in the mid @-@ 1900s to build express roads through the city 's densest neighborhoods , namely the Mid @-@ Manhattan Expressway and Lower Manhattan Expressway , did not go forward . The congestion makes Manhattan 's crosstown buses the perennial " winners " of the " Pokey Awards " for slowest service in New York City . 
 Another consequence of the strict grid plan of most of Manhattan , and the grid 's skew of approximately 28 @.@ 9 degrees , is a phenomenon sometimes referred to as <unk> ( by analogy with Stonehenge ) . On separate occasions in late May and early July , the sunset is aligned with the street grid lines , with the result that the sun is visible at or near the western horizon from street level . A similar phenomenon occurs with the sunrise in January and December . 
 The FDR Drive and Harlem River Drive , both designed by controversial New York master planner Robert Moses , comprise a single , long limited @-@ access parkway skirting the east side of Manhattan along the East River and Harlem River south of Dyckman Street . The Henry Hudson Parkway is the corresponding parkway on the West Side north of 57th Street .

 Being primarily an island , Manhattan is linked to New York City 's outer boroughs by numerous bridges , of various sizes . Manhattan has fixed highway connections with New Jersey to its west by way of the George Washington Bridge , the Holland Tunnel , and the Lincoln Tunnel , and to three of the four other New York City boroughs — the Bronx to the northeast , and Brooklyn and Queens ( both on Long Island ) to the east and south . Its only direct connection with the fifth New York City borough , Staten Island , is the Staten Island Ferry across New York Harbor , which is free of charge . The ferry terminal is located near Battery Park at Manhattan 's southern tip . It is also possible to travel on land to Staten Island by way of Brooklyn , via the Verrazano @-@ Narrows Bridge . 
 The George Washington Bridge , the world 's busiest motor vehicle bridge , connects Washington Heights , in Upper Manhattan , to Bergen County , in New Jersey . There are numerous bridges to the Bronx across the Harlem River , and five of those ( listed north to south ) — the Triborough ( known officially as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge ) , Ed Koch Queensboro ( also known as the 59th Street Bridge ) , Williamsburg , Manhattan , and Brooklyn Bridges — connect Manhattan to Long Island . 
 Several tunnels also link Manhattan Island to New York City 's outer boroughs and New Jersey . The Lincoln Tunnel , which carries 120 @,@ 000 vehicles a day under the Hudson River between New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan , is the busiest vehicular tunnel in the world . The tunnel was built instead of a bridge to allow unfettered passage of large passenger and cargo ships that sail through New York Harbor and up the Hudson River to Manhattan 's piers . The Holland Tunnel , connecting Lower Manhattan to Jersey City , New Jersey , was the world 's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel . The Queens @-@ Midtown Tunnel , built to relieve congestion on the bridges connecting Manhattan with Queens and Brooklyn , was the largest non @-@ federal project in its time when it was completed in 1940 ; President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first person to drive through it . The Brooklyn – Battery Tunnel runs underneath Battery Park and connects the Financial District at the southern tip of Manhattan to Red Hook in Brooklyn .

 Manhattan has three public heliports : the East 34th Street Heliport ( also known as the Atlantic <unk> ) at East 34th Street , owned by New York City and run by the New York City Economic Development Corporation ( " NYCEDC " ) ) ; the Port Authority Downtown Manhattan / Wall Street Heliport , owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and run by the NYCEDC ; and the West 30th Street Heliport , a privately owned heliport that is owned by the Hudson River Park Trust . US Helicopter offered regularly scheduled helicopter service connecting the Downtown Manhattan Heliport with John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey , before going out of business in 2009 . 
 = = = Utilities = = = 
 Gas and electric service is provided by Consolidated Edison to all of Manhattan . Con Edison 's electric business traces its roots back to Thomas Edison 's Edison Electric Illuminating Company , the first investor @-@ owned electric utility . The company started service on September 4 , 1882 , using one generator to provide 110 volts direct current ( DC ) to 59 customers with 800 light bulbs , in a one @-@ square @-@ mile area of Lower Manhattan from his Pearl Street Station . Con Edison operates the world 's largest district steam system , which consists of 105 miles ( 169 km ) of steam pipes , providing steam for heating , hot water , and air conditioning by some 1 @,@ 800 Manhattan customers . Cable service is provided by Time Warner Cable and telephone service is provided by Verizon Communications , although AT & T is available as well . 
 Manhattan , surrounded by two brackish rivers , had a limited supply of fresh water . To satisfy the growing population , the city of New York acquired land in Westchester County and constructed the old Croton Aqueduct system , which went into service in 1842 and was superseded by the new Croton Aqueduct , which opened in 1890 , but this was interrupted in 2008 for the construction since underway of a US $ 3 @.@ 2 billion water purification plant that can supply an estimated 290 million gallons daily when completed , representing almost a 20 % addition to the city 's availability of water , with this addition going to Manhattan and the Bronx . Water comes to Manhattan through New York City Water Tunnel No. 1 , Tunnel No. 2 , and Tunnel No. 3 , completed in 1917 , 1936 , and ( Manhattan 's supply ) 2013 , respectively . 
 Manhattan witnessed the doubling of the natural gas supply delivered to the borough when a new gas pipeline opened on November 1 , 2013 . 
 The New York City Department of Sanitation is responsible for garbage removal . The bulk of the city 's trash ultimately is disposed at mega @-@ dumps in Pennsylvania , Virginia , South Carolina and Ohio ( via transfer stations in New Jersey , Brooklyn and Queens ) since the 2001 closure of the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island . A small amount of trash processed at transfer sites in New Jersey is sometimes incinerated at waste @-@ to @-@ energy facilities . Like New York City , New Jersey and much of Greater New York relies on exporting its trash to far @-@ flung areas . 
 New York City has the largest clean @-@ air diesel @-@ hybrid and compressed natural gas bus fleet , which also operates in Manhattan , in the country . It also has some of the first hybrid taxis , most of which operate in Manhattan .

 = Institutions of the European Union = 
 The institutions of the European Union are the seven principal decision making bodies of the European Union . They are , as listed in Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union : the European Parliament , the European Council , the Council of the European Union , the European Commission , the Court of Justice of the European Union , the European Central Bank and the Court of Auditors . Institutions are different from agencies of the European Union . 
 = = History = = 
 Most EU institutions were created with the establishment of the European Community in 1958 . Much change since then has been in the context the shifting of the power balance away from the Council and towards the Parliament . The role of the Commission has often been to mediate between the two or tip the balance . However the Commission is becoming more accountable to the Parliament : in 1999 it forced the resignation of the Santer Commission and forced a reshuffle of the proposed Barroso Commission in 2004 . The development of the institutions , with incremental changes from treaties and agreements , is testament to the evolution of the Union 's structures without one clear " master plan " . Some such as Tom Reid of the Washington Post said of the institutions that " nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU " . 
 = = = Under the Treaty of Paris = = = 
 The first institutions were created at the start of the 1950s with the creation of the ECSC , based on the Schuman declaration , between six states . The ECSC was designed to bring the markets of coal and steel , the materials needed to wage war , under the control of a supranational authority with the aim of encouraging peace and economic development . It established the first institutions . At its core was an independent executive called the " High Authority " with supranational powers over the Community . The laws made by the Authority would be observed by a Court of Justice in order to ensure they were upheld and to arbitrate . 
 During the negotiations , two supervisory institutions were put forward to counterbalance the power of the High Authority . The " Common Assembly " proposed by Jean Monnet to act as a monitor , counterweight and to add democratic legitimacy was composed of 78 national parliamentarians . The second was the Council of Ministers , pushed by the smaller states also to add an intergovernmental element and harmonise national polices with those of the authority . 
 = = = Establishment and changes = = = 
 In 1957 the Treaties of Rome established two , similar , communities creating a common market ( European Economic Community ) and promoting atomic energy co @-@ operation ( Euratom ) . The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament , however they had a separate Council and High Authority , which was called the Commission in these Communities . The reason for this is the different relationship between the Commission and Council . At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities , giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive . 
 The three communities were later merged in 1967 , by the Merger Treaty , into the European Communities . The institutions were carried over from the European Economic Community ( making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor of the current Commission ) . Under the Treaties of Rome , the Common Assembly ( which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly , and then the European Parliament ) was supposed to become elected . However this was delayed by the Council until 1979 . Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties . The Maastricht Treaty also gave further powers to the Council by giving it a key role in the two new pillars of the EU which were based on intergovernmental principles . 
 The 2009 Lisbon Treaty brought nearly all policy areas ( including the budget ) under the codecision procedure ( renamed " ordinary legislative procedure " ) , hence increasing the power of the Parliament . The rules for the distribution of seats in the parliament were also changed to a formula system . The High Representative merged with the European Commissioner for External Relations and joined the Commission . The appointment of the Commission President became dependent upon the last EU elections . The Council of Ministers adopted more qualified majority voting and the European Council was made a distinct institution with a permanent president . The Court of Justice had some minor renaming and adjustments . In addition , the central bank became a full institution . 
 = = Overview = = 
 = = List = = 
 There are three political institutions which hold the executive and legislative power of the Union . The Council of the European Union represents governments , the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest . Essentially , the Council of the European Union , Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the Commission . The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Parliament and the Council of the European Union , where in most cases both must give their assent . Although the exact nature of this depends upon the legislative procedure in use , once it is approved and signed by both bodies it becomes law . The Commission 's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day @-@ to @-@ day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply . According to the 2014 edition of The Official Directory of the European Union , women account for 33 % of higher @-@ ranking officials . 
 = = = European Parliament = = = 
 The European Parliament ( EP ) shares the legislative and budgetary authority of the Union with the Council of the European Union ( not to be confused with the European Council ) . Its 751 members are elected every five years by universal suffrage and sit according to political allegiance . They represent nearly 500 million citizens ( the world 's second largest democratic electorate ) and form the only directly elected body in the Union . Despite forming one of the two legislative chambers of the Union , it has weaker powers than the Council in some sensitive areas , and does not have legislative initiative . It does , however , have powers over the Commission which the Council does not . It has been said that its democratic nature and growing powers have made it one of the most powerful legislatures in the world . 
 The Parliament 's President ( its speaker ) is Martin Schulz ( S & D / PES ) , who was elected from the Parliament 's members in 2012 . 
 = = = European Council = = = 
 The European Council is the group of heads of state or government of the EU member states . It meets four times a year to define the Union 's policy agenda and give impetus to integration . The President of the European Council is the person responsible for chairing and driving forward the work of the institution , which has been described as the highest political body of the European Union . 
 The current president is Donald Tusk . 
 = = = Council = = = 
 The Council of the European Union ( informally known as the Council of Ministers or just the Council ) is a body holding legislative and some limited executive powers and is thus the main decision making body of the Union . Its Presidency rotates between the states every six months , but every three Presidencies now cooperate on a common programme . This body is separate from the European Council , which is a similar body , but is composed of national leaders . 
 The Council is composed of twenty @-@ eight national ministers ( one per state ) . However the Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic . For example , if agriculture is being discussed , the Council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture . They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems . Votes are taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population . In these various forms they share the legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament , and also lead the Common Foreign and Security Policy . 
 The presidency has been held by Slovenia since July 1st , 2016 . 
 = = = Commission = = = 
 The European Commission ( EC ) is the executive arm of the Union . It is a body composed of one appointee from each state , currently twenty @-@ eight , but is designed to be independent of national interests . The body is responsible for drafting all law of the European Union and has a near monopoly on proposing new laws ( bills ) . It also deals with the day @-@ to @-@ day running of the Union and has the duty of upholding the law and treaties ( in this role it is known as the " Guardian of the Treaties " ) . 
 The Commission is led by a President who is nominated by the Council ( in practice the European Council ) and approved by Parliament . The remaining 27 Commissioners are nominated by member @-@ states , in consultation with the President , and have their portfolios assigned by the President . The Council then adopts this list of nominee @-@ Commissioners . The Council ’ s adoption of the Commission is not an area which requires the decision to be unanimous , their acceptance is arrived at according to the rules for qualified majority voting . The European Parliament then interviews and casts its vote upon the Commissioners . The interviews of individual nominees are conducted separately , in contrast to Parliament ’ s vote of approval which must be cast on the Commission as a whole without the ability to accept or reject individual Commissioners . Once approval has been obtained from the Parliament the Commissioners can take office . The current President is Jean @-@ Claude Juncker ( EPP ) ; his commission was elected in 2014 . 
 = = = Court of Justice of the European Union = = = 
 The Court of Justice of the European Union ( <unk> ) is the EU 's judicial branch . It is responsible for interpreting EU law and treaties . It comprises the main chamber : Court of Justice , the General Court and the Civil Service Tribunal . 
 The <unk> is located in Luxembourg . 
 = = = European Central Bank = = = 
 The European Central Bank ( ECB ) is the central bank for the eurozone ( the states which have adopted the euro ) and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability . 
 It is at the centre of the European System of Central Banks which comprises all EU national banks . The bank is governed by a board of national bank governors and a President . 
 The ECB is located in Frankfurt . 
 The current president is Mario Draghi . 
 = = = Court of Auditors = = = 
 The European Court of Auditors , despite its name , has no judicial powers . It ensures that taxpayer funds from the budget of the European Union have been correctly spent . The court provides an audit report for each financial year to the Council and Parliament . The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission 's handling of the budget . The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti @-@ fraud actions . 
 The Court of Auditors was set up in 1975 . It was created as an independent institution due to the sensitivity of the issue of fraud in the Union ( the anti @-@ fraud agency , OLAF , is also built on its independence ) . It is composed of one member from each state appointed by the Council every six years . Every three years one of them is elected as the president of the court , who is currently Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira . 
 = = Acts and procedures = = 
 There are a number of types of legislation which can be passed . The strongest is a regulation , an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety . Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve . They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them . A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person / group and is directly applicable . Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non @-@ binding declarations . 
 The ordinary legislative procedure is used in nearly all policy areas and provides an equal footing between the two bodies . Under the procedure , the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council . They then send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a " common position " . That proposal may either be approved or further amendments may be tabled by the Parliament . If the Council does not approve those , then a " Conciliation Committee " is formed . The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a common position . Once a position is agreed , it has to be approved by Parliament again by an absolute majority . There are other special procedures used in sensitive areas which reduce the power of Parliament . 
 = = Comparisons = = 
 While the EU 's system of governance is largely unique , elements can be compared to other models . One general observation on the nature of the distribution of powers would be that the EU resembles the federalism of Germany . There , powers are predominantly shared ( states can exercise federal powers where the federation has not already exercised them ) between the levels of government , and the states participate strongly with decision making at the federal level . This is in contrast with other federations , for example the United States , where powers are clearly divided between the levels of government , and the states have little say in federal decision making . 
 The EU 's institutional set up is also somewhat similar to the government of Switzerland ( which , although in Europe , is not an EU member state ) . The Swiss consensus @-@ driven system is seen as successfully uniting a state divided by language and religion , although the EU was not directly modelled on the Swiss system despite bearing a number of similarities . The European Commission has similarities to the Swiss Federal Council in that both have all @-@ party representation and are appointed on the basis of nationality rather than popularity . The President of the Federal Council rotates between its members each year , in a fashion similar to that of the EU 's Council Presidency . Due to this system of presidency Swiss leaders , like those of the EU , are relatively unknown with national politics viewed as somewhat technocratic resulting in low voter turnout , in a similar fashion to that of the European Parliament . Other parallels include the jealously guarded powers of states , the considerable level of translation and the choice of a lesser city as the capital . 
 Furthermore , executive power in the EU isn 't concentrated in a single institution . It becomes clearer under the Lisbon Treaty with the division of the European Council as a distinct institution with a fixed President . This arrangement has been compared to the dual executive system found in the French republic where there is a President ( the Council President ) and Prime Minister ( the Commission President ) . However , unlike the French model , the Council President does not hold formal powers such as the ability to directly appoint and sack the other , or the ability to dissolve Parliament . Hence while the Council President may have prestige , it would lack power and while the Commission President would have power , it would lack the prestige of the former . 
 The nature of the European Parliament is better compared with the United States House of Representatives than with the national parliaments of the European Union . This is notable in terms of the committees being of greater size and power , political parties being very decentralised and it being separated from the executive branch ( most national governments operate under a parliamentary system ) . A difference from all other parliaments is the absence of a Parliamentary legislative initiative . However , given that in most national parliaments initiatives not backed by the executive rarely succeed the value of this difference is in question . Equally , its independence and power means that the European Parliament has an unusually high success rate for its amendments in comparison to national parliaments ; 80 % average and 30 % for controversial proposals . 
 The composition of the council can only be compared with the quite unique and unusual composition of the German upper house , the Bundesrat . Membership of the Bundesrat is limited to members of the governments of the states of Germany and can be recalled by those governments in the same manner as the EU 's Council . They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat and if their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments ( who are solely responsible for their appointment ) or they cease to sit in their state government . Hence they also are not elected at the same time and the body as a whole cannot be dissolved like most parliaments . As government representatives , members do not vote as individual members but in state blocks , rather than political alignment , to their state governments ' agreed line . Each state has unequal voting powers based on population , with an absolute majority required for decisions . Likewise , the presidency rotates equally between members , though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council . However , unlike the EU 's Council , the Bundesrat does not vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed . They both bear similar criticisms , because of the interference , of executives in the legislative process . 
 = = Locations = = 
 The institutions are not concentrated in a single capital city : instead , their headquarters are spread across four cities , Brussels , Luxembourg , Strasbourg and Frankfurt . The current arrangement was approved in 1992 and attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam . The treaty states that the Commission and Council would be based in Brussels , the Courts in Luxembourg and the Parliament in Strasbourg . However some departments of the Commission and meetings of the Council take place in Luxembourg , while the Parliament has its committees and some sessions in Brussels and its secretariat in Luxembourg . Of the new institutions , the Central Bank is based in Frankfurt while the European Council is based in Brussels ( but has some extraordinary meetings elsewhere ) . 
 Brussels ' hosting of institutions has made it a major centre for the EU . Together with NATO it has attracted more journalists and ambassadors than Washington D.C. However the three @-@ city agreement has been criticised , notably concerning the Parliament due to the large number of people that move between the cities . The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200 million euro and 20 @,@ 268 tonnes of carbon dioxide . Brussels is preferred by some due to the presence of other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity . 
 = People v. Aguilar = 
 People v. Aguilar , 2 <unk> 321 ( Ill . 2013 ) , was an Illinois Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Aggravated Unlawful Use of a Weapon ( AUUF ) statute violated the right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment . The Court stated that this was because the statute amounted to a wholesale statutory ban on the exercise of a personal right that was specifically named in and guaranteed by the United States Constitution , as construed by the United States Supreme Court . A conviction for Unlawful Possession of a Firearm ( UPF ) was proper because the possession of handguns by minors was conduct that fell outside the scope of the Second Amendment 's protection . 
 In 2008 , Alberto Aguilar , then 17 , was arrested and charged with AUUF and UPF . After being convicted and sentenced to probation by the trial court , he appealed , arguing that both statutes were unconstitutional infringements of his Second Amendment rights . The Illinois Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction , and he appealed that ruling to the Illinois Supreme Court . While Aguilar 's appeal was pending , the Federal Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that the AUUF statute was unconstitutional . 
 When the matter was decided by the Illinois Supreme Court , they agreed with the Seventh Circuit and declared the AUUF law unconstitutional , but upheld the constitutionality of the UPF law .

 Illinois was the last state in the nation to allow concealed carry of a handgun . Prior to 2013 , Illinois prohibited the carry of a firearm in a loaded condition , other than at one 's own property . If the firearm was loaded and not in a locked case , or if it was otherwise available for immediate use , it was a felony offense called Aggravated Unlawful Use of a Weapon ( AUUF ) . Illinois courts had uniformly upheld the constitutionally of the statute prior to 2008 . The state also had a law called Unlawful Possession of a Firearm ( UPF ) , which prohibited anyone under the age of 18 from possessing a firearm . Additionally , the City of Chicago had enacted strict gun control laws prohibiting the possession of any handgun that had not been registered prior to 1982 , when the law took effect . 
 On June 26 , 2008 , exactly two weeks after Aguilar 's arrest , the U.S. Supreme Court decided District of Columbia v. Heller . In Heller , the Court ruled that a law of the District of Columbia which had the effect of banning handguns in the city violated the Second Amendment and was unconstitutional . The Court said that the fundamental right protected by the Second Amendment was the right to self @-@ defense ; however since the District of Columbia was a federal jurisdiction , it was not clear that this applied to the individual states .

 On June 12 , 2008 , Chicago Police Officer Thomas Harris was in a surveillance position in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago and observed a group of male teenagers creating a disturbance and throwing bottles at cars .

The other officers made contact with the teens and Officer John Dolan saw Aguilar drop a gun onto the ground . Aguilar , then 17 , was arrested . The officers noted that the handgun had three rounds loaded in it and that the serial number was filed off .

 Aguilar was tried for AUUF and UPF at the Circuit Court for Cook County . The officers testified that Aguilar had the gun and had dropped it , while Aguilar claimed that he never had a gun , but was waiting for his mother to pick him up when officers came running into the back yard and tackled him . Aguilar 's testimony was corroborated by Romero Diaz , who stated that Aguilar did not have a gun . Judge Charles P. Burns determined that the officers were more credible and found Aguilar guilty on both counts , sentencing him to 24 months probation on the AUUF charge ; he did not pass sentence on the UPF charge .

 Aguilar then appealed his conviction , arguing that the AUUF statute violated the Second Amendment and was unconstitutional . The Court of Appeals , evaluating Heller , found that Heller only protected the right to possess a handgun in the home . The court also evaluated McDonald and found that while it applied the Second Amendment to the states , it also only applied to handguns possessed in the home . The court , using an intermediate scrutiny test , determined that the Illinois statute was substantially related to an important governmental objective to protect the public from gun violence . The court affirmed the conviction .

 In 2008 , shortly after the Heller decision , three lawsuits were filed in Illinois , challenging the constitutionally of handgun bans in Chicago and Oak Park . All three cases were consolidated and heard in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois , and were dismissed based on earlier U.S. Supreme Court rulings that the Second Amendment did not apply to the states . The cases were appealed to the Seventh Circuit , which affirmed based on the same reasoning . The U.S. Supreme Court reversed that decision , holding that the Second Amendment was applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment , and clarified that " self @-@ defense was ' the central component of the right itself .

 = = = = Moore v. Madigan = = = = 
 In 2011 , two federal lawsuits were filed in the Southern District of Illinois and the Central District of Illinois . In both cases , the plaintiffs claimed that AUUF statute violated the Second Amendment in that it did not allow any method for a citizen to bear arms outside the home . Mary Shepard argued that the statutes were facially unconstitutional , while Michael Moore argued that the statutes were unconstitutional as applied . In both cases , the judges granted the state 's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim , holding that the Second Amendment only protected the right to possess arms in the home . Both Moore and Shepard appealed their cases to the Seventh Circuit , where the cases were consolidated . 
 The Seventh Circuit found that Illinois law did violate the Constitution in that there was no method for a person to carry a weapon for self @-@ defense outside of the home . The court stated that the district courts had read Heller and McDonald too narrowly — that the right protected was self @-@ defense , and there was as great if not greater need outside the home . The court rejected the state 's argument that strict gun regulation lowered crime , noting that the evidence did not support that . The decisions of the district courts were reversed and the cases remanded to those courts with instructions to declare the Illinois law unconstitutional , issuing a permanent injunction against the law 's enforcement . The court then stayed the order for 180 days to give the Illinois legislature an opportunity to amend the law to make it constitutional .

 In January 2013 the Illinois Legislature began to look at enacting legislation to address the Moore decision . Lt.

On May 31 , 2013 , the state house passed a shall @-@ issue bill by a vote of 89 – 28 , after state senate passed it by a vote of 45 – 12 . Both had veto @-@ proof margins .

 On appeal , Aguilar again argued that the AUUF statute was unconstitutional on its face . Aguilar also made the argument that the UPF statute was unconstitutional , since at the time the Second Amendment was adopted , 16- and 17 @-@ year @-@ olds could lawfully bear arms . 
 The state argued that Aguilar lacked standing to contest the constitutionality of the statute . The state claimed that since Aguilar denied having committing the act that the statute prohibited , he could not contest the constitutionality of it . 
 = = = Opinion of the court = = = 
 Justice Robert R. Thomas delivered the opinion of a unanimous court . Thomas first disposed of the standing argument by the state , noting that Aguilar was not challenging the statute as applied , but was arguing that the statute was facially unconstitutional since it did not provide for any person to legally bear arms . Since anyone could challenge the constitutionality of a statute when they were charged with violating it , even without admitting the underlying conduct , the state 's argument was without merit . 
 Thomas then evaluated the constitutionality of the AUUF statute , noting that the Heller court had " concluded that the second amendment ' guarantee [ s ] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation . . . . ' " He noted that McDonald reiterated that self @-@ defense was at the core of the right . He analyzed what other courts in Illinois had done , noting that they had all focused on the ruling in Heller that the right existed in the home , and that they had held the AUUF statute constitutional since it affected conduct outside of the home . Thomas then compared this to the ruling by the Seventh Circuit in Moore and concluded that their ruling was correct , that the AUUF statute did in fact infringe on the rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment . Since the statute was unconstitutional , Aguilar 's conviction must be reversed . 
 Thomas rejected the argument on the unconstitutionality of the UPF statute , noting that all courts that had addressed this issue had found that persons under 21 could be barred from possessing firearms . The conviction for UPF was affirmed , and the case was remanded .

 Following the decision , Cook County prosecutors stated that they would drop charges against some of the pending cases for AUUF , but that only those with valid Illinois Firearms Owner Identification cards would have the charges dropped . By September 16 , 2013 , the first case had been dismissed in Cook County . A number of law enforcement <unk> , such as the Springfield Police and the Sangamon Sheriff 's Office , made a plea to the public to not immediately begin to carry concealed handguns . Some prosecutors have already announced that they do not intend to prosecute these cases . 
 = Optical properties of carbon nanotubes = 
 Within materials science , the optical properties of carbon nanotubes refer specifically to the absorption , photoluminescence ( fluorescence ) , and Raman spectroscopy of carbon nanotubes . Spectroscopic methods offer the possibility of quick and non @-@ destructive characterization of relatively large amounts of carbon nanotubes . There is a strong demand for such characterization from the industrial point of view : numerous parameters of the nanotube synthesis can be changed , intentionally or unintentionally , to alter the nanotube quality . As shown below , optical absorption , photoluminescence and Raman <unk> allow quick and reliable characterization of this " nanotube quality " in terms of non @-@ tubular carbon content , structure ( chirality ) of the produced nanotubes , and structural defects . Those features determine nearly any other properties such as optical , mechanical , and electrical properties . 
 Carbon nanotubes are unique " one @-@ dimensional systems " which can be envisioned as rolled single sheets of graphite ( or more precisely graphene ) . This rolling can be done at different angles and curvatures resulting in different nanotube properties . The diameter typically varies in the range 0 @.@ 4 – 40 nm ( i.e. " only " ~ 100 times ) , but the length can vary ~ 10 @,@ 000 times , reaching 55 @.@ 5 cm . The nanotube aspect ratio , or the length @-@ to @-@ diameter ratio , can be as high as 132 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 : 1 , which is unequalled by any other material . Consequently , all the properties of the carbon nanotubes relative to those of typical semiconductors are extremely anisotropic ( directionally dependent ) and tunable . 
 Whereas mechanical , electrical and electrochemical ( <unk> ) properties of the carbon nanotubes are well established and have immediate applications , the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear . The aforementioned <unk> of properties is potentially useful in optics and photonics . In particular , light @-@ emitting diodes ( LEDs ) and photo @-@ detectors based on a single nanotube have been produced in the lab . Their unique feature is not the efficiency , which is yet relatively low , but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light and the possibility of its fine tuning through the nanotube structure . In addition , bolometer and optoelectronic memory devices have been realised on ensembles of single @-@ walled carbon nanotubes . 
 = = Terminology = = 
 This article uses the following abbreviations : 
 Carbon nanotube ( CNT ) 
 Single wall carbon nanotube ( SWCNT ) 
 <unk> carbon nanotube ( <unk> ) 
 However , C is often omitted in scientific literature , so NT , SWNT and <unk> are more commonly used . Also , " wall " is often exchanged with " walled " . 
 = = Electronic structure of carbon nanotube = = 
 A single @-@ wall carbon nanotube can be imagined as graphene sheet rolled at a certain " chiral " angle with respect to a plane perpendicular to the tube 's long axis . Consequently , SWCNT can be defined by its diameter and chiral angle . The chiral angle can range from 0 to 30 degrees . 
 However , more conveniently , a pair of indices ( n , m ) is used instead . The indices refer to equally long unit vectors at 60 ° angles to each other across a single 6 @-@ member carbon ring . Taking the origin as carbon number 1 , the a1 unit vector may be considered the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 3 , and the a2 unit vector is then the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 5 . ( See the upper right corner of the diagram at right . ) To visualize a CNT with indices ( n , m ) , draw n a1 unit vectors across the graphene sheet , then draw m a2 unit vectors at a 60 ° angle to the a1 vectors , then add the vectors together . The line representing the sum of the vectors will define the circumference of the CNT along the plane perpendicular to its long axis , connecting one end to the other . In the diagram at right , Ch is a ( 4 , 2 ) vector : the sum of 4 unit vectors from the origin directly to the right , then 2 unit vectors at a 60 ° angle down and to the right . 
 Tubes having n 
 = m ( chiral angle = 
 30 ° ) are called " armchair " and those with m 
 = 0 ( chiral angle = 
 0 ° ) " zigzag " . Those indices uniquely determine whether CNT is a metal , semimetal or semiconductor , as well as its band gap : when | m – n | 
 = 3k ( k is integer ) , the tube is metallic ; but if | m – n | = 
 3k ± 1 , the tube is semiconducting . The nanotube diameter d is related to m and n as 
 <formula> 
 In this equation , a = 0 @.@ 246 nm is the magnitude of either unit vector a1 or a2 . 
 The situation in multi @-@ wall CNTs is complicated as their properties are determined by contribution of all individual shells ; those shells have different structures , and , because of the synthesis , are usually more defective than SWCNTs . Therefore , optical properties of <unk> will not be considered here . 
 = = Van Hove singularities = = 
 Optical properties of carbon nanotubes derive from electronic transitions within one @-@ dimensional density of states ( DOS ) . A typical feature of one @-@ dimensional crystals is that their DOS is not a continuous function of energy , but it descends gradually and then increases in a discontinuous spike . In contrast , three @-@ dimensional materials have continuous DOS . The sharp peaks found in one @-@ dimensional materials are called Van Hove singularities . 
 Van Hove singularities result in the following remarkable optical properties of carbon nanotubes : 
 Optical transitions occur between the v1 − c1 , v2 − c2 , etc . , states of semiconducting or metallic nanotubes and are traditionally labeled as S11 , S22 , M11 , etc . , or , if the " conductivity " of the tube is unknown or unimportant , as E11 , E22 , etc . Crossover transitions c1 − v2 , c2 − v1 , etc . , are dipole @-@ forbidden and thus are extremely weak , but they were possibly observed using cross @-@ polarized optical geometry . 
 The energies between the Van Hove singularities depend on the nanotube structure . Thus by varying this structure , one can tune the optoelectronic properties of carbon nanotube . Such fine tuning has been experimentally demonstrated using UV illumination of polymer @-@ dispersed CNTs . 
 Optical transitions are rather sharp ( ~ 10 meV ) and strong . Consequently , it is relatively easy to selectively excite nanotubes having certain ( n , m ) indices , as well as to detect optical signals from individual nanotubes . 
 = = Kataura plot = = 
 The band structure of carbon nanotubes having certain ( n , m ) indexes can be easily calculated . A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura to rationalize experimental findings . A Kataura plot relates the nanotube diameter and its bandgap energies for all nanotubes in a diameter range . The oscillating shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects the intrinsic strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the ( n , m ) index rather than on its diameter . For example , ( 10 , 1 ) and ( 8 , 3 ) tubes have almost the same diameter , but very different properties : the former is a metal , but the latter is a semiconductor . 
 = = Optical absorption = = 
 Optical absorption in carbon nanotubes differs from absorption in conventional 3D materials by presence of sharp peaks ( 1D nanotubes ) instead of an absorption threshold followed by an absorption increase ( most 3D solids ) . Absorption in nanotubes originates from electronic transitions from the v2 to c2 ( energy E22 ) or v1 to c1 ( E11 ) levels , etc . The transitions are relatively sharp and can be used to identify nanotube types . Note that the sharpness deteriorates with increasing energy , and that many nanotubes have very similar E22 or E11 energies , and thus significant overlap occurs in absorption spectra . This overlap is avoided in photoluminescence mapping measurements ( see below ) , which instead of a combination of overlapped transitions identifies individual ( E22 , E11 ) pairs . 
 Interactions between nanotubes , such as bundling , broaden optical lines . While bundling strongly affects photoluminescence , it has much weaker effect on optical absorption and Raman scattering . Consequently , sample preparation for the latter two techniques is relatively simple . 
 Optical absorption is routinely used to quantify quality of the carbon nanotube powders . 
 The spectrum is analyzed in terms of intensities of nanotube @-@ related peaks , background and pi @-@ carbon peak ; the latter two mostly originate from non @-@ nanotube carbon in contaminated samples . However , it has been recently shown that by aggregating nearly single chirality semiconducting nanotubes into closely packed Van der Waals bundles the absorption background can be attributed to free carrier transition originating from intertube charge transfer . 
 = = = Carbon nanotubes as a black body = = = 
 An ideal black body should have emissivity or absorbance of 1 @.@ 0 , which is difficult to attain in practice , especially in a wide spectral range . Vertically aligned " forests " of single @-@ wall carbon nanotubes can have <unk> of 0 @.@ 98 – 0 @.@ 99 from the far @-@ ultraviolet ( 200 nm ) to far @-@ infrared ( 200 μm ) wavelengths . 
 These SWNT forests ( <unk> ) were grown by the super @-@ growth CVD method to about 10 μm height . Two factors could contribute to strong light absorption by these structures : ( i ) a distribution of CNT <unk> resulted in various <unk> for individual CNTs . Thus a compound material was formed with broadband absorption . ( ii ) Light might be trapped in those forests due to multiple reflections . 
 = = Luminescence = = 
 = = = Photoluminescence ( Fluorescence ) = = = 
 <unk> single @-@ walled carbon nanotubes emit near @-@ infrared light upon <unk> , described interchangeably as fluorescence or photoluminescence ( PL ) . The excitation of PL usually occurs as follows : an electron in a nanotube absorbs excitation light via S22 transition , creating an electron @-@ hole pair ( exciton ) . Both electron and hole rapidly relax ( via phonon @-@ assisted processes ) from c2 to c1 and from v2 to v1 states , respectively . Then they recombine through a c1 − v1 transition resulting in light emission . 
 No <unk> luminescence can be produced in metallic tubes . Their electrons can be excited , thus resulting in optical absorption , but the holes are immediately filled by other electrons out of the many available in the metal . Therefore , no excitons are produced . 
 = = = Salient properties = = = 
 Photoluminescence from SWCNT , as well as optical absorption and Raman scattering , is linearly polarized along the tube axis . This allows monitoring of the SWCNTs orientation without direct microscopic observation . 
 PL is quick : relaxation typically occurs within 100 <unk> . 
 PL efficiency was first found to be low ( ~ 0 @.@ 01 % ) , but later studies measured much higher quantum yields . By improving the structural quality and isolation of nanotubes , emission efficiency increased . A quantum yield of 1 % was reported in nanotubes sorted by diameter and length through gradient centrifugation , and it was further increased to 20 % by optimizing the procedure of isolating individual nanotubes in solution . 
 The spectral range of PL is rather wide . Emission wavelength can vary between 0 @.@ 8 and 2 @.@ 1 micrometers depending on the nanotube structure . 
 <unk> are apparently delocalized over several nanotubes in single chirality bundles as the photoluminescence spectrum displays a splitting consistent with intertube exciton tunneling . 
 Interaction between nanotubes or between a nanotube and another material may quench or increase PL . No PL is observed in multi @-@ walled carbon nanotubes . PL from double @-@ wall carbon nanotubes strongly depends on the preparation method : CVD grown <unk> show emission both from inner and outer shells . However , <unk> produced by encapsulating fullerenes into SWCNTs and annealing show PL only from the outer shells . Isolated SWCNTs lying on the substrate show extremely weak PL which has been detected in few studies only . Detachment of the tubes from the substrate drastically increases PL . 
 Position of the ( S22 , S11 ) PL peaks depends slightly ( within 2 % ) on the nanotube environment ( air , dispersant , etc . ) . However , the shift depends on the ( n , m ) index , and thus the whole PL map not only shifts , but also warps upon changing the CNT medium . 
 = = = Applications = = = 
 Photoluminescence is used for characterization purposes to measure the quantities of semiconducting nanotube species in a sample . <unk> are isolated ( dispersed ) using an appropriate chemical agent ( " dispersant " ) to reduce the intertube quenching . Then PL is measured , scanning both the excitation and emission energies and thereby producing a PL map . The ovals in the map define ( S22 , S11 ) pairs , which unique identify ( n , m ) index of a tube . The data of Weisman and <unk> are conventionally used for the identification . 
 <unk> fluorescence has been investigated for the purposes of imaging and sensing in biomedical applications . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Optical properties , including the PL efficiency , can be modified by encapsulating organic dyes ( carotene , lycopene , etc . ) inside the tubes . Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT . Thus potentially , optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it . Besides , encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions . For example , Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL ( efficiency close to 100 % ) . However , encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL , thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> ( CL ) — light emission excited by electron beam — is a process commonly observed in TV screens . An electron beam can be finely focused and scanned across the studied material . This technique is widely used to study defects in semiconductors and nanostructures with nanometer @-@ scale spatial resolution . It would be beneficial to apply this technique to carbon nanotubes . However , no reliable CL , i.e. sharp peaks assignable to certain ( n , m ) indices , has been detected from carbon nanotubes yet . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 If appropriate electrical contacts are attached to a nanotube , electron @-@ hole pairs ( excitons ) can be generated by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts . Subsequent exciton recombination results in <unk> ( EL ) . <unk> devices have been produced from single nanotubes and their macroscopic assemblies . Recombination appears to proceed via triplet @-@ triplet annihilation giving distinct peaks corresponding to E11 and E22 transitions . 
 = = Raman scattering = = 
 Raman spectroscopy has good spatial resolution ( ~ 0 @.@ 5 micrometers ) and sensitivity ( single nanotubes ) ; it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative . Consequently , Raman spectroscopy is probably the most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization . Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant , i.e. , only those tubes are probed which have one of the <unk> equal to the exciting laser energy . Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum , as discussed below . 
 Similar to photoluminescence mapping , the energy of the excitation light can be scanned in Raman measurements , thus producing Raman maps . Those maps also contain oval @-@ shaped features uniquely identifying ( n , m ) indices . Contrary to PL , Raman mapping detects not only semiconducting but also metallic tubes , and it is less sensitive to nanotube bundling than PL . However , requirement of a tunable laser and a dedicated spectrometer is a strong technical impediment . 
 = = = Radial breathing mode = = = 
 Radial breathing mode ( RBM ) corresponds to radial expansion @-@ contraction of the nanotube . Therefore , its frequency νRBM ( in cm − 1 ) depends on the nanotube diameter d as , νRBM = A / d + B ( where A and B are constants dependent on the environment in which the nanotube is present . For example , B = 0 for individual nanotubes . ) ( in nanometers ) and can be estimated as νRBM 
 = 234 / d + 10 for SWNT or νRBM = 
 248 / d for <unk> , which is very useful in deducing the CNT diameter from the RBM position . Typical RBM range is 100 – 350 cm − 1 . If RBM intensity is particularly strong , its weak second overtone can be observed at double frequency . 
 = = = Bundling mode = = = 
 The bundling mode is a special form of RBM supposedly originating from collective vibration in a bundle of SWCNTs . 
 = = = G mode = = = 
 Another very important mode is the G mode ( G from graphite ) . This mode corresponds to planar vibrations of carbon atoms and is present in most graphite @-@ like materials . G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite ( 1580 cm − 1 ) and is split into several peaks . The splitting pattern and intensity depend on the tube structure and excitation energy ; they can be used , though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode , to estimate the tube diameter and whether the tube is metallic or semiconducting . 
 = = = D mode = = = 
 D mode is present in all graphite @-@ like carbons and originates from structural defects . Therefore , the ratio of the G / D modes is conventionally used to quantify the structural quality of carbon nanotubes . High @-@ quality nanotubes have this ratio significantly higher than 100 . At a lower functionalisation of the nanotube , the G / D ratio remains almost unchanged . This ratio gives an idea of the functionalisation of a nanotube . 
 = = = G ' mode = = = 
 The name of this mode is misleading : it is given because in graphite , this mode is usually the second strongest after the G mode . However , it is actually the second overtone of the defect @-@ induced D mode ( and thus should logically be named D ' ) . Its intensity is stronger than that of the D mode due to different selection rules . In particular , D mode is forbidden in the ideal nanotube and requires a structural defect , providing a phonon of certain angular momentum , to be induced . In contrast , G ' mode involves a " self @-@ annihilating " pair of phonons and thus does not require defects . The spectral position of G ' mode depends on diameter , so it can be used roughly to estimate the SWCNT diameter . In particular , G ' mode is a doublet in double @-@ wall carbon nanotubes , but the doublet is often unresolved due to line broadening . 
 Other overtones , such as a combination of RBM + G mode at ~ 1750 cm − 1 , are frequently seen in CNT Raman spectra . However , they are less important and are not considered here . 
 = = = Anti @-@ Stokes scattering = = = 
 All the above Raman modes can be observed both as Stokes and anti @-@ Stokes scattering . As mentioned above , Raman scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature , i.e. only tubes whose band gap energy is similar to the laser energy are excited . The difference between those two energies , and thus the band gap of individual tubes , can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the Stokes / anti @-@ Stokes lines . This estimate however relies on the temperature factor ( Boltzmann factor ) , which is often miscalculated – a focused laser beam is used in the measurement , which can locally heat the nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample . 
 = = Rayleigh scattering = = 
 Carbon nanotubes have very large aspect ratio , i.e. , their length is much larger than their diameter . Consequently , as expected from the classical electromagnetic theory , elastic light scattering ( or Rayleigh scattering ) by straight CNTs has anisotropic angular dependence , and from its spectrum , the band gaps of individual nanotubes can be deduced . 
 Another manifestation of Rayleigh scattering is the " antenna effect " , an array of nanotubes standing on a substrate has specific angular and spectral distributions of reflected light , and both those distributions depend on the nanotube length . 
 = St Dona 's Church , Llanddona = 
 St Dona 's Church , Llanddona is a small 19th @-@ century parish church in the village of Llanddona , in Anglesey , north Wales . The first church on this site was built in 610 . The present building on the site dates from 1873 , and was designed by the rector at the time . It reuses earlier material including a decorated 15th @-@ century doorway and a 17th @-@ century bell . 
 The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , and is one of seven churches in a combined parish . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " , in particular because it is regarded as " a simple late 19th @-@ century essay in Gothic revival " . 
 = = History and location = = 
 St Dona 's Church is on a steep hill near the coast on the eastern side of Anglesey , about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the village of Llanddona itself . The village takes its name from its parish church : the Welsh word llan originally meant " enclosure " and then " church " , and " – <unk> " is a modified form of the saint 's name . St Dona 's is surrounded by a churchyard , entered through a lychgate dated 1906 which bears a memorial to Henry Stanley , 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley , " Patron and Benefactor of this church " . 
 According to the 19th @-@ century Anglesey historian Angharad Llwyd , a church was built here in 610 , dedicated to St Dona , who lived on the sea shore nearby . The presence of a church here was recorded in the Norwich Taxation of 1254 . Repairs were carried out in the 1840s : one 19th @-@ century writer , Samuel Lewis , recorded that the internal state of St Dona 's was " wretched in the extreme " until the rural dean at the time put it " into a state of creditable repair " . In 1873 , the rector ( Peter Jones ) had the church entirely rebuilt to his own design . 
 St Dona 's is still in use for worship and belongs to the Church in Wales . It is one of seven churches in the combined benefice of Beaumaris with Llanddona and Llaniestyn . It is within the deanery of Tindaethwy and Menai , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2012 , the rector is the Reverend Neil <unk> . 
 = = Architecture and fittings = = 
 St Dona 's is built of rubble masonry , dressed with freestone . The roof is made from slate , and has a bellcote made from stone at the west end . There is a stone cross finial at the east end of the roof . The church is entered through a porch on the south side which leads to a doorway dating from the 15th century . The rounded doorway is decorated with figures of a bird , a dog and a human face on the left , and a cherub on the right . Inside , the nave is separated from the chancel by a step , and the sanctuary is itself raised one step above the chancel . The roof timbers can be seen from inside . The window at the east end has three lights ( vertical sections separated by mullions ) topped with ogee curves , and is set within a pointed arch with an external hoodmould . It contains stained glass added in 1963 , depicting Christ with sea in the background ( centre ) , St <unk> ( left ) and St Dona ( right ) ; above them are images of a lion , dove , lamb and eagle . A stone bearing the date 1566 has been set upside down into the wall above the east window . The other windows are plain and smaller , with one or two lights . The glass in the other windows has been described as " unusual opaque leaded glass " . 
 The fittings are from the late 19th century , although the octagonal font ( made of gritstone ) is of uncertain date , possibly 14th century . The bell is dated 1647 . A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire recorded the presence of an 18th @-@ century communion table , an Elizabethan cover @-@ paten dated 1574 , and a silver cup dated 1769 – 1772 .

 St Dona 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building – the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " . It was given this status on 30 January 1968 , and has been listed because it is " a simple late 19th @-@ century essay in Gothic revival " . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes that " its simple character " is " appropriate to its scale and site " . A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region described St Dona 's as " drably rebuilt " . 
 = Gerald Ratner Athletics Center = 
 The Gerald Ratner Athletics Center is a $ 51 million athletics facility within the University of Chicago campus in the Hyde Park community area on the South Side of Chicago , Illinois in the United States . The building was named after University of Chicago alumnus , Gerald Ratner . The architect of this suspension structure that is supported by masts , cables and counterweights was César Pelli , who is best known as the architect of the Petronas Towers . 
 The Ratner Athletics Center was approved for use in September 2003 . The facility includes , among other things : a competition gymnasium , a multilevel fitness facility , an Olympic @-@ sized swimming pool , a multipurpose dance studio , meeting room space , and athletic department offices . It serves as home to several of the university 's athletic teams and has hosted numerous National Collegiate Athletic Association Division III regional and University Athletic Association conference championship events . 
 Located at the southwest corner of Ellis Avenue and 55th Street , the Ratner Center has an award @-@ winning design that substitutes a complex external mast and counterweight system for interior support devices to allow for large open @-@ space areas inside the building . Cesar Pelli & Associates Inc. was credited as the design architect and OWP / P was the architect of record . 
 = = History = = 
 A ceremonial groundbreaking was held for the Ratner Center on October 28 , 2000 . The Ratner Center opened to the public on September 29 , 2003 , although it was not officially dedicated until homecoming weekend on October 11 . The building , which represented a collaboration between Cesar Pelli & Associates and Chicago 's OWP / P , was the first new athletic facility on the University of Chicago campus in 68 years . It was a part of a $ 500 million University @-@ wide capital improvement plan that occurred between 1999 and 2005 . Part of the plan included the Pelli @-@ designed parking structure across the street from the Athletics Center . The parking structure is named the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center Parking Structure . The athletic center is known for its innovative asymmetrically supported cable @-@ stayed structural system and S @-@ shaped roofs . It is composed of a masted building to the north containing the Myers @-@ McLoraine Swimming Pool , a masted building to the south containing the gymnasia , and a central building containing the Bernard DelGiorno fitness center . 
 Ratner , <unk> , ’ 35 , J.D. , ’ 37 , contributed $ 15 million toward the $ 51 million cost . He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate and played for the baseball team during the time that the University participated in the Big Ten Conference . After graduating with a law degree , Order of the Coif , he eventually founded his own law firm Gould & Ratner in 1949 . Helen Myers McLoraine , also an alumnus from the 1930s , contributed in excess of $ 5 million to fund the swimming pool . Bernard DelGiorno — a gymnast with many degrees from the university : AB ’ 54 , AB ’ 55 , MBA ’ 55 — has made numerous donations including a $ 5 million one in 2006 to fund athletic facilities as well as other infrastructure on campus . DelGiorno worked in industrial relations and personnel at a steel plant before becoming a stockbroker for Paine Webber , which became a part of UBS Financial Services .

 The building features the 50 @-@ metre ( 55 yd ) x 25 @-@ yard ( 23 m ) Myers @-@ McLoraine Swimming Pool , which can be configured with up to 20 lanes in the 25 @-@ yard dimension and nine lanes in the 50 @-@ meter dimension . The pool 's configuration is flexible with a moveable bulkhead which allows for simultaneous activities . It also has a pair of one @-@ meter diving boards . The pool depth ranges from 4 to 13 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 to 4 @.@ 1 m ) in the shallow end and the diving well , respectively . The 24 @,@ 700 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 2 @,@ 295 m2 ) competition natatorium features seating for 350 spectators .

The Myers @-@ McLoraine Swimming Pool was the site of the 2005 University Athletic Association Swimming and Diving Championship . It also hosted swimming at the 2006 Gay Games . 
 The center is available to University and hospital faculty , staff , alumni , and retirees as well as their spouses and children on a paid membership basis and registered students for free . As of 2010 , the University of Chicago is one of the few remaining universities in the United States to have a swimming requirement for its undergraduate degree program . Aside from the military service academies and a few of the Ivy League schools only a half dozen Universities had such a requirement as of 2006 . The swimming pool is the location of the administration of the two @-@ lap requirement . The facilities memberships are available to students as well as University and hospital faculty , staff , alumni and retirees , as well as spouses and children . Registered students ' memberships are free . 
 The building is complemented at the University by its predecessors the Henry Crown Field House and the modern incarnation of Stagg Field , which will continue to augment the athletic facilities needs of the campus patrons . Features of the indoor Henry Crown Field House include a 200 @-@ meter indoor running track ; racquetball , handball and squash courts ; multipurpose courts ; a multipurpose room ; and cardiovascular and weight training equipment . The Stagg Field outdoor complex includes a 400 @-@ meter track , eight tennis courts , and fields for baseball , softball , American football and soccer .

 The construction employed 2 @,@ 000 short tons ( 1 @,@ 814 t ; 1 @,@ 786 long tons ) of steel . The 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 907 @,@ 185 kg ) roof of the gym is supported by a pair of 125 @-@ foot ( 38 m ) steel masts . The pool 's roof is supported by three masts . Each mast is composed of three 18 @-@ inch ( 46 cm ) diameter steel hollow structural sections ( HSS ) filled with high @-@ strength concrete that are arranged in a tapered tied @-@ column configuration . 
 The German @-@ import masts are united by 120 high @-@ strength steel cables that total approximately 6 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 981 m ) in length . They are inclined at a 10 degree angle from vertical . Each tapered composite mast that supports the flattened S @-@ shaped roof girders is supported by 15 splaying cables ; 9 fore @-@ stay cables and 6 <unk> cables . During construction , the masts were filled with 10 @,@ 000 pounds per square inch ( 69 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 Pa ) cast @-@ in @-@ place concrete using innovative pumping techniques . 
 Concrete counterweights totaling 2 @,@ 500 cubic yards ( 1 @,@ 911 m3 ) — with some as large as 50 by 25 by 13 feet ( 15 @.@ 2 by 7 @.@ 6 by 4 @.@ 0 m ) — counteract the weight of the roof from below the ground . The masts and counterweights are likened as external form @-@ giving elements to flying buttresses in gothic architecture , which predominates the campus ' architecture . The building is said to interpret gothic architecture through structural expressionism . The exterior support design made the interior space more receptive to open natural lighting and more accommodating for free movement . 
 The roof design incorporated multi @-@ level splayed cables so that the structural roof members could form a 33 @-@ inch ( 83 @.@ 8 cm ) deep uniformly curved roof plane . The roof members are curved and shallow . They support 7 2 @-@ inch ( 5 @.@ 1 cm ) thick 25 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) metal roof deck spans between the roof girders . The <unk> girders are cold bent with reverse curves to multiple radii . The curved roof planes are suspended from German “ full @-@ lock ” steel cables and include three outer layers of interlocking Z @-@ shaped wires designed to minimize water infiltration and corrosion . 
 The engineering of the masts was complicated because stability was so important to the overall design success of the suspension structure . Mast displacements could significantly alter cable length and tension and redistribute loads through the superstructure contrary to design . The key to successful design was control of the foundation settlement . The sites natural underlying subsurface conditions were stiff silty clay below a medium dense sand layer , which was determined to be too accommodating to settlement to host the structure . Ground improvement , consisting of triple @-@ fluid jet grouting , was performed to reduce the compressibility of the silty clay , stiffen the sand deposit and provide a desirable shallow foundation system . This site marked the first time that these geotechnical ground improvement techniques were employed .

 = No Me Queda Más = 
 " No Me Queda Más " ( English : " There 's Nothing Left for Me " ) is a song by American recording artist Selena for her fourth studio album , Amor Prohibido ( 1994 ) . It was released as the third single from the album in October 1994 by EMI Latin . " No Me Queda Más " was written by Ricky Vela , while production was handled by Selena 's brother A.B. Quintanilla . A downtempo mariachi and pop ballad , " No Me Queda Más " portrays the ranchera storyline of a woman in agony after the end of a relationship . Its lyrics express an unrequited love , with the singer saying their love was the best and most important time for her even though he now is done with it . 
 " No Me Queda Más " , praised by music critics for its emotive nature , was one of the most successful singles of Selena 's career . It topped the United States Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart for seven non @-@ consecutive weeks , her third successive number @-@ one song . It was Selena 's first number @-@ one track on the US Regional Mexican Airplay chart , and became the most successful US Latin single of 1995 . It has been ranked the ninth @-@ best Tejano recording by Billboard magazine and the eleventh @-@ best Hot Latin Songs chart single in 2011 . 
 A music video for " No Me Queda Más " was shot in San Antonio 's Amtrak station . It received the Music Video of the Year award at the Billboard Latin Music Awards , whilst the recording received two Broadcast Music honors including Song of the Year . Many musicians have since recorded cover versions , including Mexican singer Pepe Aguilar , American salsa singer Tito Nieves , and Mexican pop group Palomo . The Palomo version peaked at number six on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart , while Nieves ' version reached number seven on the US Tropical Songs chart .

After Suzette 's September 1993 marriage , Vela wrote " No Me Queda Más " and it was given to Selena to record for Amor Prohibido . Although the song was originally planned to be recorded as a mariachi track , EMI Latin president Jose Behar believed that a mariachi recording would not appeal to the popular market . Following this , the group gave it to Argentine arranger Bebu Silvetti to rework into a pop @-@ style track , and Behar asked Silvetti to " sweeten " the song to boost its airplay and chart performance . The result enhanced Selena 's pop @-@ radio success . Behar said in a Billboard interview that the song was " internalized " without affecting the originality of its recording . In a 2002 interview , Selena 's brother A.B. Quintanilla , said that during a recording session he had asked Selena to record the song for a fifth time . The singer replied , " What you got there is what you got " and left to go shopping : " Now looking back , she really did a beautiful job when recording the song , she had so much passion . The song became a classic . That 's what I can remember from one of the beautiful memories I have of Amor Prohibido . "

 " Master Cat , or The <unk> Cat " ( Italian : Il <unk> con gli <unk> ; French : Le Maître chat ou le Chat <unk> ) , commonly known in English as " Puss in Boots " , is a European literary fairy tale about a cat who uses trickery and deceit to gain power , wealth , and the hand of a princess in marriage for his penniless and low @-@ born master . The oldest record of written history dates from Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola , who included it in his The Facetious Nights of Straparola ( c . 1550 – 53 ) in XIV – XV . Another version was published in 1634 , by Giambattista Basile with the title Cagliuso . The tale was written in French at the close of the seventeenth century by Charles Perrault ( 1628 – 1703 ) , a retired civil servant and member of the Académie française . The tale appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript two years before its 1697 publication by Barbin in a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault called Histoires ou contes du temps passé . The book was an instant success and remains popular . 
 Perrault 's Histoires has had considerable impact on world culture . The original Italian title of the first edition was Costantino Fortunato , but was later known as Il <unk> con gli <unk> ( lit . The cat with the boots ) ; the French title was " Histoires ou contes du temps passé , avec des <unk> " with the subtitle " Les Contes de ma mère l 'Oye " ( " Stories or Fairy Tales from Past Times with Morals " , subtitled " Mother Goose Tales " ) . The frontispiece to the earliest English editions depicts an old woman telling tales to a group of children beneath a placard inscribed " MOTHER <unk> 'S <unk> " and is credited with launching the Mother Goose legend in the English @-@ speaking world . " Puss in Boots " has provided inspiration for composers , choreographers , and other artists over the centuries . The cat appears in the third act pas de <unk> of Tchaikovsky 's ballet The Sleeping Beauty , for example , and makes appearances in other media . Puss in Boots is a popular pantomime in the UK . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The tale opens with the third and youngest son of a miller receiving his inheritance — a cat . At first , the youngest son laments , as the eldest brother gains the mill , and the middle brother gets the mules . The feline is no ordinary cat , however , but one who requests and receives a pair of boots . Determined to make his master 's fortune , the cat bags a rabbit in the forest and presents it to the king as a gift from his master , the fictional Marquis of Carabas . The cat continues making gifts of game to the king for several months . 
 One day , the king decides to take a drive with his daughter . The cat persuades his master to remove his clothes and enter the river which their carriage passes . The cat disposes of his master 's clothing beneath a rock . As the royal coach nears , the cat begins calling for help in great distress . When the king stops to investigate , the cat tells him that his master the Marquis has been bathing in the river and robbed of his clothing . The king has the young man brought from the river , dressed in a splendid suit of clothes , and seated in the coach with his daughter , who falls in love with him at once . 
 The cat hurries ahead of the coach , ordering the country folk along the road to tell the king that the land belongs to the " Marquis of Carabas " , saying that if they do not he will cut them into mincemeat . The cat then happens upon a castle inhabited by an ogre who is capable of transforming himself into a number of creatures . The ogre displays his ability by changing into a lion , frightening the cat , who then tricks the ogre into changing into a mouse . The cat then pounces upon the mouse and devours it . The king arrives at the castle that formerly belonged to the ogre , and , impressed with the bogus Marquis and his estate , gives the lad the princess in marriage . Thereafter , the cat enjoys life as a great lord who runs after mice only for his own amusement . 
 The tale is followed immediately by two morals : " one stresses the importance of possessing <unk> and savoir faire while the other extols the virtues of dress , countenance , and youth to win the heart of a princess . " The Italian translation by Carlo Collodi notes that the tale gives useful advice if you happen to be a cat or a Marquis of Carabas . 
 This is the theme in France , but other versions of this theme exist in Asia , Africa , and South America . 
 = = Background = = 
 Perrault 's " The Master <unk> , or Puss in Boots " is the most renowned tale in all of Western folklore of the animal as helper . However , the trickster cat was not Perrault 's invention . Centuries before the publication of Perrault 's tale , <unk> , a Kashmir Brahmin , assembled a vast collection of Indian folk tales called <unk> Sarit <unk> ( lit . " The ocean of the streams of stories " ) that featured stock fairy tale characters and trappings such as invincible swords , vessels that replenish their contents , and helpful animals . In the Panchatantra ( lit . " Five Principles " ) , a collection of Hindu tales from the fifth century A.D. , a tale follows a cat who fares much less well than Perrault 's Puss as he attempts to make his fortune in a king 's palace . 
 In 1553 , " Costantino Fortunato " , a tale similar to " Le Maître Chat " , was published in Venice in Giovanni Francesco Straparola 's Le <unk> <unk> ( lit . The Facetious Nights ) , the first European storybook to include fairy tales . In Straparola 's tale however , the poor young man is the son of a Bohemian woman , the cat is a fairy in disguise , the princess is named <unk> , and the castle belongs not to an ogre but to a lord who conveniently perishes in an accident . The poor young man eventually becomes King of Bohemia . An edition of Straparola was published in France in 1560 . The abundance of oral versions after Straparola 's tale may indicate an oral source to the tale ; it also is possible Straparola invented the story . 
 In 1634 , another tale with a trickster cat as hero was published in Giambattista Basile 's collection <unk> although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault 's lifetime . In Basile , the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso ( sometimes Cagliuso ) whose fortunes are achieved in a manner similar to Perrault 's Puss . However , the tale ends with Cagliuso , in gratitude to the cat , promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death . Three days later , the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw it out the window . The cat leaps up , demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life . The cat then rushes away , leaving his master to fend for himself . In another rendition , the cat performs acts of bravery , then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats . 
 It is likely that Perrault was aware of the Straparola tale , since ' Facetious Nights ' was translated into French in the C16 and from thence passed into the oral tradition .

 The oldest record of written history was published in Venice by the Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola in his The Facetious Nights of Straparola ( c . 1550 @-@ 53 ) in XIV @-@ XV . His original title was Costantino Fortunato ( lit . Lucky Costantino ) . 
 Le Maître Chat , ou le Chat <unk> was later published by Barbin in Paris in January 1697 in a collection of tales called Histoires ou contes du temps passé . The collection included " La Belle au bois dormant " ( " The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood " ) , " Le petit chaperon rouge " ( " Little Red Riding Hood " ) , " La Barbe bleue " ( " Blue Beard " ) , " Les <unk> " ( " The Enchanted Ones " , or " Diamonds and Toads " ) , " Cendrillon , ou la petite <unk> de <unk> " ( " Cinderella , or The Little Glass Slipper " ) , " Riquet à la Houppe " ( " Riquet with the Tuft " ) , and " Le Petit <unk> " ( " Hop o ' My Thumb " ) . The book displayed a frontispiece depicting an old woman telling tales to a group of three children beneath a placard inscribed " <unk> DE MA <unk> <unk> " ( Tales of Mother Goose ) . The book was an instant success . 
 Le Maître Chat first was translated into English as " The Master Cat , or Puss in Boots " by Robert <unk> in 1729 and published in London for J. Pote and R. Montagu with its original companion tales in Histories , or Tales of Past Times , By M. Perrault . The book was advertised in June 1729 as being " very entertaining and instructive for children " . A frontispiece similar to that of the first French edition appeared in the English edition launching the Mother Goose legend in the English @-@ speaking world . <unk> 's translation has been described as " faithful and straightforward , conveying attractively the concision , liveliness and gently ironic tone of Perrault 's prose , which itself emulated the direct approach of oral narrative in its elegant simplicity . " Since that publication , the tale has been translated into various languages and published around the world . 
 = = Question of authorship = = 
 Perrault 's son Pierre Darmancour was assumed to have been responsible for the authorship of Histoires with the evidence cited being the book 's dedication to Élisabeth Charlotte d 'Orléans , the youngest niece of Louis XIV , which was signed " P. Darmancour " . Perrault senior , however , long was known to have been interested in contes de <unk> or contes de ma mère l <unk> , and in 1693 published a versification of " Les <unk> <unk> " and , in 1694 , a tale with a Cinderella theme called " Peau d <unk> " . Further , a handwritten and illustrated manuscript of five of the tales ( including Le Maistre Chat ou le Chat <unk> ) existed two years before the tale 's 1697 Paris publication . Pierre Darmancour was sixteen or seventeen years old at the time the manuscript was prepared and , as scholars Iona and Peter Opie note , quite unlikely to have been interested in recording fairy tales . Darmancour , who became a soldier , showed no literary inclinations , and , when he died in 1700 , his obituary made no mention of any connection with the tales . However , when Perrault senior died in 1703 , the newspaper alluded to his being responsible for " La Belle au bois dormant " , which the paper had published in 1696 . 
 = = Adaptations = = 
 Perrault 's tale has been adapted to various media over the centuries . Ludwig Tieck published a dramatic satire based on the tale , called Der <unk> Kater , and , in 1812 , the Brothers Grimm inserted a version of the tale into their Kinder- und <unk> . In ballet , Puss appears in the third act of Tchaikovsky 's The Sleeping Beauty in a pas de <unk> with The White Cat . In film and television , Walt Disney produced an animated black and white silent short based on the tale in 1922 . It was also adapted into a manga by the famous Japanese writer and director Hayao Miyazaki in 1969 , and in the mid @-@ 1980s , Puss in Boots was televised as an episode of Faerie Tale Theatre with Ben Vereen and Gregory Hines in the cast . Another version from the Cannon Movie Tales series features Christopher Walken as Puss , who in this adaptation is a cat who turns into a human when wearing the boots . Another adaptation of the character with little relation to the story was in the Pokémon anime episode " Like a Meowth to a Flame , " where a Meowth owned by the character Tyson wore boots , a hat , and a neckerchief . DreamWorks Animation released the animated feature Puss in Boots , with Antonio Banderas reprising his voice @-@ over role from the Shrek films , on November 4 , 2011 . This new film 's story bears no similarities to the book . The cat food named Puss n Boots is owned by <unk> USA LLC and is available in the USA and Canada . 
 = = Commentaries = = 
 Jacques <unk> and Henry Pettit note in their introduction to The Authentic Mother Goose : Fairy Tales and Nursery Rhymes that the main motif of " Puss in Boots " is the animal as helper and that the tale " carries atavistic memories of the familiar totem animal as the father protector of the tribe found everywhere by missionaries and anthropologists . " They also note that the title is original with Perrault as are the boots ; no tale prior to Perrault 's features a cat wearing boots . 
 Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie observe that " the tale is unusual in that the hero little deserves his good fortune , that is if his poverty , his being a third child , and his unquestioning acceptance of the cat 's sinful instructions , are not nowadays looked upon as virtues . " The cat should be acclaimed the prince of ' con ' artists , they declare , as few swindlers have been so successful before or since . The success of Histoires is attributed to seemingly contradictory and incompatible reasons . While the literary skill employed in the telling of the tales has been recognized universally , it appears the tales were set down in great part as the author heard them told . The evidence for that assessment lies first in the simplicity of the tales , then in the use of words that were , in Perrault 's era , considered populaire and du bas peuple , and finally , in the appearance of vestigial passages that now are superfluous to the plot , do not illuminate the narrative , and thus , are passages the Opies believe a literary artist would have rejected in the process of creating a work of art . One such vestigial passage is Puss 's boots ; his insistence upon the footwear is explained nowhere in the tale , it is not developed , nor is it referred to after its first mention except in an aside . 
 According to the Opies , Perrault 's great achievement was accepting fairy tales at " their own level . " He neither recounted them with impatience nor mockery , and without feeling that they needed any aggrandisement such as a frame story — although he must have felt it useful to end with a rhyming <unk> . Perrault would be revered today as the father of folklore if he had taken the time to record where he obtained his tales , when , and under what circumstances . 
 Bruno Bettelheim remarks that " the more simple and straightforward a good character in a fairy tale , the easier it is for a child to identify with it and to reject the bad other . " The child identifies with a good hero because the hero 's condition makes a positive appeal to him . If the character is a very good person , then the child is likely to want to be good too . <unk> tales , however , show no polarization or juxtaposition of good and bad persons because amoral tales such as " Puss in Boots " build character , not by offering choices between good and bad , but by giving the child hope that even the <unk> can survive . Morality is of little concern in these tales , but rather , an assurance is provided that one can survive and succeed in life . Small children can do little on their own and may give up in disappointment and despair with their attempts . Fairy stories , however , give great dignity to the smallest achievements ( such as befriending an animal or being befriended by an animal , as in " Puss in Boots " ) and that such ordinary events may lead to great things . Fairy stories encourage children to believe and trust that their small , real achievements are important although perhaps not recognized at the moment . 
 In Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion Jack Zipes notes that Perrault " sought to portray ideal types to reinforce the standards of the civilizing process set by upper @-@ class French society " . A composite portrait of Perrault 's heroines , for example , reveals the author 's idealized female of upper @-@ class society is graceful , beautiful , polite , industrious , well groomed , reserved , patient , and even somewhat stupid because for Perrault , intelligence in womankind would be threatening . Therefore , Perrault 's composite heroine passively waits for " the right man " to come along , recognize her virtues , and make her his wife . He acts , she waits . If his seventeenth century heroines demonstrate any characteristics , it is submissiveness . 
 A composite of Perrault 's male heroes , however , indicates the opposite of his heroines : his male characters are not particularly handsome , but they are active , brave , ambitious , and deft , and they use their wit , intelligence , and great civility to work their way up the social ladder and to achieve their goals . In this case of course , it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills . Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage , the male @-@ centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men . The virtues of Perrault 's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault , who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century . 
 According to fairy and folk tale researcher and commentator Jack Zipes , Puss is " the epitome of the educated <unk> secretary who serves his master with complete devotion and diligence . " The cat has enough wit and manners to impress the king , the intelligence to defeat the ogre , and the skill to arrange a royal marriage for his low @-@ born master . Puss 's career is capped by his elevation to grand seigneur and the tale is followed by a double moral : " one stresses the importance of possessing <unk> et savoir faire while the other extols the virtues of dress , countenance , and youth to win the heart of a princess . " 
 The renowned illustrator of Dickens ' novels and stories , George Cruikshank , was shocked that parents would allow their children to read " Puss in Boots " and declared : " As it stood the tale was a succession of successful falsehoods — a clever lesson in lying ! — a system of imposture rewarded with the greatest worldly advantages . " 
 Another critic , Maria Tatar , notes that there is little to admire in Puss — he threatens , flatters , deceives , and steals in order to promote his master . She further observes that Puss has been viewed as a " linguistic virtuoso " , a creature who has mastered the arts of persuasion and rhetoric to acquire power and wealth . " Puss in Boots " has successfully supplanted its antecedents by Straparola and Basile and the tale has altered the shapes of many older oral trickster cat tales where they still are found . The morals Perrault attached to the tales are either at odds with the narrative , or beside the point . The first moral tells the reader that hard work and ingenuity are preferable to inherited wealth , but the moral is belied by the poor miller 's son who neither works nor uses his wit to gain worldly advantage , but marries into it through trickery performed by the cat . The second moral stresses womankind 's vulnerability to external appearances : fine clothes and a pleasant visage are enough to win their hearts . In an aside , Tatar suggests that if the tale has any redeeming meaning , " it has something to do with inspiring respect for those domestic creatures that hunt mice and look out for their masters . " Briggs does assert that cats were a form of fairy in their own right having something akin to a fairy court and their own set of magical powers . Still , it is rare in Europe 's fairy tales for a cat to be so closely involved with human affairs . According to Jacob Grimm , Puss shares many of the features that a household fairy or deity would have including a desire for boots which could represent seven @-@ league boots . This may mean that the story of " Puss and Boots " originally represented the tale of a family deity aiding an impoverished family member . 
 Stefan Zweig , in his 1939 novel , <unk> des Herzens , references Puss in Boots ' procession through a rich and varied countryside with his master and drives home his metaphor with a mention of Seven League Boots .

During the localization , numerous alterations to names and cultural references were made to preserve the effect through translation , but some Japanese cultural references were altered or removed . 
 The release of the game in Japan was accompanied by merchandise such as character costumes and accessories . The North American package of the game was released with a CD with selected music from the game , and , unlike Persona 3 , the European package also contained a soundtrack CD . The music , as with the previous game , was composed primarily by Shoji Meguro . He was joined this time by <unk> Hirata , who performed vocals on various songs , including the theme song " Pursuing My True Self " . The game was positively received by critics and developed into a full franchise . Various manga and light novel adaptations and spin @-@ offs have been produced . A television anime adaptation by AIC ASTA , titled Persona 4 : The Animation , aired in Japan between October 2011 and March 2012 , with an anime adaptation of Persona 4 Golden , produced by A @-@ 1 Pictures , airing as of July 2014 . The game has also spawned two fighting game sequels , Persona 4 Arena and Persona 4 Arena Ultimax , and a rhythm game , Persona 4 : Dancing All Night . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Persona 4 blends traditional RPG gameplay with simulation elements . The player controls the game 's protagonist , a teenage boy who is named by the player , who comes to the town of Inaba for a year . Gameplay is divided between the real world of Inaba , where the protagonist carries out his daily life , and the mysterious " TV World " , where various dungeons filled with monsters known as Shadows await . With the exception of scripted events , such as plot progression or special events , players can choose to spend their day how they like , be it participating in various real world activities , such as joining school clubs , taking part @-@ time jobs , or reading books , or exploring the TV World 's dungeons to gain experience and items . Days are broken up into various times of day , the most reoccurring being " After School / Daytime " and " Evening " , with most activities causing time to move on . Certain activities are limited depending on the time of day , days of the week , and the weather , with most evening activities unavailable if the player visits the TV World that day . Furthermore , some activities and dialogue choices may be limited by the protagonist 's five attributes ; Understanding , Diligence , Courage , Knowledge , and Expression , which can be increased by performing certain activities that build them . Whilst the player is free to choose how to spend their time , if they fail to rescue someone who is trapped in the TV World by the time fog appears in town , which takes place after several days of consecutive rain , the game will end , forcing the player to return to a week prior . As the game progresses , the protagonist forms friendships with other characters known as " Social Links " , which are each represented by one of the Major Arcana . As these bonds strengthen , the Social Links increase in Rank , which grant bonuses when creating new Personas in the Velvet Room . Additionally , strengthening Social Links with the main party members grant them additional abilities , such as the ability to perform a follow @-@ up attack or an additional ability for their Persona . 
 = = = Personas = = = 
 The main focus of the game revolves around Personas , avatars projected from one 's inner self that resemble mythological figures and represent the façades worn by individuals to face life 's hardships . Each Persona possesses its own skills , as well as strengths and weaknesses to certain attributes . As Personas gain experience from battle and level up , that Persona can learn new skills , which include offensive or support abilities used in battle , or passive skills that grant the character benefits . Each Persona can carry up to eight skills at a time , with older skills needing to be forgotten in order to learn new ones . Whilst each of the main party members have their own unique Persona , which transforms into a stronger form after maxing out their Social Link , the protagonist has the " Wild Card " ability to wield multiple Personas , which he can switch between during battle to access different movesets . The player can earn new Personas from Shuffle Time , with the protagonist able to carry more Personas as he levels up . Outside of the dungeons , the player can visit the Velvet Room , where players can create new Personas , or summon previously acquired Personas for a fee . New Personas are created by fusing two or more monsters to create a new one , which receives some of the skills passed down from its material monsters . The level of Personas that can be created are limited by the protagonist 's current level . If the player has built up a Social Link relating to a particular Arcana , then a Persona relating to that Arcana will receive a bonus upon creation . 
 = = = Combat = = = 
 Inside the TV World , the player assembles a party , consisting of the protagonist and up to three other characters , to explore randomly generated dungeons , each tailored around a victim who had been kidnapped . On each floor of a dungeon , the player may find roaming Shadows , as well as treasure chests containing items and equipment . Players progress through the dungeon by finding the stairs somewhere on each floor to progress to the next , eventually reaching the final floor where a boss enemy awaits . The player enters battle upon coming into contact with a Shadow . The player can gain an advantage by attacking the Shadow from behind , whilst being attacked from behind themselves will give the enemy an advantage . Similar to the Press Turn system used in other Shin Megami Tensei games , battles are turn @-@ based with characters fighting enemies using their equipped weapons , items , or the special skills of their Personas . Aside from the protagonist , who is controlled directly , the other characters can either be given direct commands or be assigned ' Tactics ' which alter their battle AI . If the protagonist loses all of his HP , the game ends , returning players to the title screen . 
 Offensive abilities carry several attributes , including Physical , Fire , Ice , Wind , Electricity , Light , Dark and Almighty . As well as various enemies carrying different attributes , player characters may also have strengths or weaknesses against certain attacks depending on their Persona or equipment . By exploiting an enemy 's weakness or performing a critical attack , the player can knock them over , granting the attacking character an additional move , whilst the enemy may also be granted an additional move if they target a player character 's weakness . If the player knocks all of the enemies down , they may be granted the opportunity to perform an " All @-@ Out Attack " , in which all the players rush the downed enemies to inflict heavy damage . Following a battle , players gain experience points , money , and items from their battle . Sometimes after a battle , the player may participate in a mini @-@ game known as " Shuffle Time " , which can grant player various bonuses or new Personas .

 = = = Setting and characters = = = 
 Persona 4 takes place in the fictional , rural Japanese town of Inaba , which lies among floodplains and has its own high school and shopping districts . Unexplained murders have taken place in the small town , where bodies are found dangling from television antennas and their cause of death unknown . At the same time , rumor has begun to spread that watching a switched @-@ off television set on rainy midnights will reveal a person 's soulmate . The game also follows the main characters into the TV World , a fog @-@ shrouded realm filled with monsters called Shadows , which can only be accessed through TV sets . 
 The protagonist is a high school student who has recently moved from a large city to Inaba , where he is to live and attend school for a year . At school , he quickly becomes friends with Yosuke Hanamura , the somewhat @-@ clumsy son of the manager of the local Junes megastore ; Chie <unk> , an energetic girl with a strong interest in martial arts ; and Yukiko Amagi , a calm and refined girl who helps out at her family 's inn . A few days into the game , the protagonist , Yosuke , and Chie follow the " Midnight Channel " rumor , which leads them to discover the TV World and meet Teddie , a friendly creature that appears as a hollow bear costume . Using Personas , the students form an Investigation Team to investigate the connection between the TV world and the murders , and possibly capture the culprit . As the game progresses , the group gains new members , including : Kanji Tatsumi , a male delinquent who has a talent for feminine hobbies ; Rise Kujikawa , a former teen idol trying to find her identity who moves to Inaba as a transfer student ; and Naoto Shirogane , a young female detective investigating the case with the local police who wears masculine clothing and presents herself as male due to fear of rejection . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 On April 11 , 2011 , the protagonist arrives in Inaba to live with the <unk> , consisting of his uncle Ryotaro and his cousin Nanako , for one year , as his parents are working abroad . Just after his arrival , a TV announcer is found dead , her body hanging from an antenna ; Saki Konishi , the high school student who had discovered the body , is later found dead herself , hung upside @-@ down from a telephone pole . After the protagonist and his friends accidentally enter the TV world , they encounter Teddie , who helps them travel freely between the TV and real worlds . They awaken their Persona abilities , realizing that the murders stem from attacks by Shadows , beings native to the TV world created from repressed emotions , and are able to rescue several would @-@ be victims . Yosuke , Chie , Yukiko , Kanji , Rise , and Teddie one by one come to accept the parts of their psyches they rejected , which manifest as giant Shadows in the TV world , allowing them to wield Personas whilst each joins the group in turn . Mitsuo Kubo , a student from another high school who disappears following the death of <unk> Morooka , the protagonist 's foul @-@ mouthed homeroom teacher , claims credit for the murders ; it is eventually learned that Kubo only killed Morooka and played no part in the other murders , having murdered Morooka simply to gain credit for the other murders . Naoto Shirogane , a nationally @-@ renowned " Detective Prince " investigating the case , is also rescued and gains a Persona , and joins the group who learn that " he " is actually a girl who assumed a male identity to avoid the police 's sexism . 
 Events come to a head when Ryotaro Dojima mistakenly accuses the protagonist of being involved in the murders . Nanako is kidnapped during the protagonist 's interrogation , leading Ryotaro to engage in a vehicular pursuit with the culprit . The chase ends as they both crash ; the kidnapper escapes with Nanako through a television set in his truck , and the gravely @-@ injured Ryotaro entrusts her rescue to the group . The group tracks them down within the TV world ; the culprit , Taro Namatame , becomes a god @-@ like monster — <unk> @-@ <unk> — which attacks them but is defeated , and both he and Nanako are taken to the Inaba hospital . When Nanako appears to die , the group furiously confronts Namatame ; as the protagonist , the player must help the others realize that Namatame is not the killer by pointing out the lack of a proper motive , and subsequently work to determine that Ryotaro 's assistant , Tohru Adachi , is the true killer . Failure to do so ends the game with the party unable to solve the case ; Nanako either remaining dead , or reviving but remaining hospitalised ; and the recurring fog permanently setting in , the last of which will eventually lead to humanity 's demise . 
 Having identified the culprit as Adachi , the party chases and locates him within the TV world . Adachi explains that his actions were out of both boredom and the belief that humanity is better off believing what it wants ; his claims are dismissed by the party as the rantings of a madman . After fighting Adachi , he is possessed by <unk> @-@ <unk> , the Japanese God of Fog , who reveals that the fog is harmful to people and will eventually cause humanity to fall into a permanent state of ignorance and transform into Shadows . Upon his defeat , he agrees to lift the fog , congratulating the party on their resolve . Defeated , the wounded Adachi agrees to assume responsibility for his actions and turns himself in . The game moves forward to the day before the protagonist must travel home . If the player returns to the Dojima residence , the game ends with the party sending the protagonist off as he departs Inaba . Alternatively , should the player be able to identify the unexplained cause of the Midnight Channel and attempt to resolve this plot element , the protagonist meets with the party , and together they decide to end the case for good . 
 The protagonist confronts the gas station attendant encountered at the start of the game , who reveals herself to be the Japanese goddess Izanami , the " conductor " behind the game 's events . The cause of the recurring fog is established as an attempt to create a world of illusion by merging the TV world with the human world , all for the " sake " of humanity . The group tracks Izanami down within the TV world and battle her , but is at first unable to win ; the defeated protagonist is given strength by the bonds he has forged with those around him , and with this power awakens a new Persona — Izanagi @-@ no @-@ Okami — which he uses to defeat Izanami . In doing so , the fog in each world is lifted , and the TV world is restored to its original form . The game ends with the party sending the protagonist off the following day , and a post @-@ credits scene depicts the group resolving to remain friends forever , as the protagonist examines a photo of the party . 
 = = Development = = 
 According to the game director Katsura Hashino , while " ideas [ had been ] thrown around earlier " , development on Persona 4 in Japan did not begin until after the release of Persona 3 . The development team consisted of the team from Persona 3 and new hires which included fans of Persona 3 . Atlus intended to improve both the gameplay and story elements of Persona 3 for the new game , to ensure it was not seen as a " retread " of its predecessor . Hashino said that " to accomplish that , we tried to give the players of Persona 4 a definite goal and a sense of purpose that would keep motivating them as they played through the game . The murder mystery plot was our way of doing that . " The plot of Persona 4 was " greatly inspired " , according to Hashino , by mystery novelists such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , Agatha Christie and <unk> <unk> . Persona 4 was officially unveiled in the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu in March 2008 . An article in the issue detailed the game 's murder mystery premise , rural setting , and new weather forecast system . The game 's North American release date was announced at the 2008 Anime Expo in Los Angeles , California . Atlus would not make an add @-@ on disc or epilogue for Persona 4 , as had been done with the Persona 3 FES . Persona 4 allowed players full control of characters in battle . This was due to negative comments from players about most of the player team in Persona 3 being controlled by the game 's AI . The amount of data the team ended up incorporating around school life , character relationships and spoke character dialogue was so large that there were fears it would not fit onto a single disc . The anime cutscenes were produced by Studio Hibari . 
 The design of Inaba is based on a town on the outskirts of Mount Fuji . Its rural design was a source of conflict between Persona 4 's developers , as " each staff member had their own image of a rural town " , according to director Katsura Hashino . The entire staff went " location hunting " to determine Inaba 's design . Inaba does not represent " a country town that has tourist attractions " , but rather a non @-@ notable , " ' nowhere ' place " . Hashino described the town as being " for better or for worse ... a run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill town " . Unlike other role @-@ playing games , which may have large worlds for the player to explore , Persona 4 mostly takes place in Inaba . This reduced development costs , and enabled Atlus " to expand other portions of the game " in return . A central setting also allows players to " sympathize with the daily life that passes in the game " . To prevent the setting from becoming stale , the development team established a set number of in @-@ game events to be created to " keep the game exciting " . The choice of Japanese mythical figures for the characters ' Personas as opposed to the Graeco @-@ Roman deities used in earlier games was directly inspired by the new setting . The appearances of Personas were based on the characters ' personalities . The design team had a good deal of creating freedom , as while Japanese deities has well @-@ defined character traits , their appearances were generally little known . The Shadows were created by Hashino without much outside consultation , although he had help from female staff for female Shadow selves . 
 Despite living in the countryside , Persona 4 characters were designed to look and sound " normal " and like " modern high @-@ schoolers " , according to lead editor Nich Maragos . Initially , he wrote the game 's cast as being " more rural than was really called for " . " The characters aren 't really hicks ... They just happen to live in a place that 's not a major metropolitan area . " While interviewing members of Persona 4 's development team , 1UP.com editor Andrew Fitch noted that the characters from the city — Yosuke and the protagonist — have " more stylish " hair than the other characters . Art director Shigenori Soejima used hair styles to differentiate between characters from the city versus the country . " With Yosuke in particular , I gave him accessories , such as headphones and a bicycle , to make it more obvious that he was from the city . " 
 = = = Localization = = = 
 As with Persona 3 , the localization of Persona 4 was handled by Yu Namba and Nich Maragos of Atlus USA . In addition , there were four translators and two further editors . The Social Links were divided equally between the translators and editors . During localization of the game , character 's names were altered for the international audience for familiarity , including Kuma being renamed Teddie . A similar change was done for Rise Kujikawa 's stage name , " <unk> " ( <unk> , <unk> ) in Japan to " <unk> " . <unk> also explained the change from " Community " ( <unk> , <unk> ) to " Social Link " , regarding the gameplay mechanic , as " community " has a different meaning in English , whereas Igor in his speeches often refers to " society " and " bonds " . Names were also altered for pun and other linguistic effect including dungeon items ' names such as the Kae Rail ( <unk> , <unk> ) becoming the " <unk> @-@ M " , as the item 's use of returning the player to the entrance was taken to be " go home " and changing Junes 's slogan from " Everyday Young Life ! Junes ! " ( <unk> ・ <unk> ！ <unk> ！ , <unk> <unk> Raifu ! <unk> ! , with " Junes " coming from the French Jeunesse for youth ) to " Everyday 's great at your Junes " , and eliminating some Japanese cultural references that would not transfer , such as the reference to Kosuke <unk> . There were also some issues regarding the translation of the names of Yukiko , Kanji and Rise 's dungeons , as the English names were made to fit the original Japanese graphics , and the " Void Quest " dungeon 's graphics were specifically made to harken back to the NES . He also remarked on how popular the interpretations of Kanji 's Shadow were in the west , and how it did not change how the character was seen by the other audience . A different change was the fact the main characters in the English dub referred to others members of the cast on a first @-@ name basis , while the Japanese version differed in this regard . For the dub , the editors sometimes switched between first @-@ name and last @-@ name referral for dramatic effect . 
 Atlus 's senior project manager Masaru <unk> commented it was decided that " Shin Megami Tensei " was to be kept in the title of Persona 3 and Persona 4 , as it was believed that they were part of the same series as Shin Megami Tensei : Nocturne ; however , the " Shin Megami Tensei " title was omitted from both Persona 4 Golden and Persona 4 Arena , as it would have been much too long . Similarly , Persona 4 : The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena and Persona 4 : The Golden were shortened to the previously stated titles . As with Persona 3 , the honorifics used in the Japanese voice track were retained in the English dub , despite proving contentions among series fans . This was done as part of an intended trend to remain faithful to the original source material . The pronunciations of honorifics , along with the sounds of names , were a point that was carefully considered by the localization team and it took a while for the English cast to get used to them . A member of the English dub that also appeared in Persona 3 was Yuri Lowenthal . Though he had dubbed characters in Persona 3 , Namba wanted him to have a larger part . His role as Yosuke ended up featuring 1000 more lines of dialogue than the other major characters . Important roles for the localization team were Teddie and Rise , as they would be the party 's supports . Another element in the English script was that the use of swear words was increased over Persona 3 : the first draft featured very strong language which was cut as it did not seem suited . The character Kanji was given a lot of swearing in his dialogue , due to his volatile nature . The use of swearing was carefully considered depending on the emotional situation . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The soundtrack was primarily composed and directed by Shoji Meguro . The soundtrack features songs with vocals by <unk> Hirata , whom Meguro felt was able to meet the range of emotion needed for the soundtrack , with the lyrics being written by Reiko Tanaka . Meguro was given a rough outline of the game 's plot and worked on the music in the same manner and simultaneously with the development of the story and spoken dialog , starting with the overall shape of the songs and eventually working on the finer details . According to Meguro , the songs " Pursuing My True Self " and " Reach Out to the Truth " were composed to reflect the inner conflicts of the game 's main characters ; the former song , used as the opening theme , helped to set an understanding of the characters ' conflicts , while the latter , used in battle sequences , emphasized the " strength of these characters to work through their internal struggles . " The " Aria of the Soul " theme used in the Velvet Room , a concept common to all the Persona games , remained relatively unchanged , with Meguro believing " the shape of the song had been well @-@ defined " from previous games . Composers Atsushi Kitajoh and Ryota Koduka also contributed music for the game . Kitajoh , who had previously written music for Atlus with <unk> VI and Trauma Center : New Blood , contributed four themes to Persona 4 , while Koduka wrote the " Theme of Junes " . 
 Persona 4 's two @-@ disc soundtrack was released in Japan by Aniplex on July 23 , 2008 . The soundtrack was also released in North America . The side A of the soundtrack is the bonus disc packaged with each game , while side B of the soundtrack was part of Amazon.com 's exclusive Persona 4 Social Link Expansion Pack . Similarly to Persona 3 , a " Reincarnation " album , titled Never More , was released in Japan on October 26 , 2011 , featuring full length cuts of the game 's vocal tracks and extended mixes of some of the instrumental tracks . Never More made it to the top of both the Oricon Weekly Album Charts and Billboard 's Japan Top Albums chart for the week of its release , selling nearly 27 @,@ 000 copies .

It was originally planned by Atlus to be a PlayStation Portable title , similar to Persona 3 Portable , which would have required removing some of the features of the PlayStation 2 game . However , the Vita provided sufficient resources that allowed Atlus to expand the game . It is an expanded version of the PlayStation 2 title , adding new features and story elements to the game .

 Persona 4 received critical acclaim from game critics upon release . Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb described it as " one of the best times I 've had with video games , whether I was playing by myself or watching someone else play it . " Famitsu pointed out that while " there isn 't much new from the last game " , it favored the changes over the battle system , where the pacing " is quick so it doesn 't get to be a pain " , and the ability to control party members " makes play that much easier " . IGN on the other hand noted that " the pacing can be somewhat off " , and " some things feel repurposed or unaffected from previous games " , while praising the game as an " evolution of the RPG series , and an instant classic " . It also noted that the soundtrack can be " a bit repetitive " . RPGFan 's Ryan Mattich recommended Persona 4 as " one of the best RPG experiences of the year " , noting that " among the cookie @-@ cutter sequels and half @-@ hearted remakes " , the game is " a near flawless example of the perfect balance between ' falling back on what works ' and ' pushing the genre forward ' . " 1UP.com 's Andrew Fitch summarized Persona 4 as " some of this decade 's finest RPG epics " , although the reviewer criticized its " slight loading issues " and the time spent " waiting for the plot to advance " . GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9 @.@ 3 , stating it 's an exception to the rule of the Japanese role @-@ playing genre , and that it stands out of any other JRPG , including its predecessor , Persona 3 . Wired pointed out that while the graphics are not up to par with those of the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 , " the clever art style makes up for that " . It also praised the game 's soundtrack as " excellent , especially the battle music " . 
 The game 's setting garnered mixed reactions . IGN labeled Persona 4 as " a murder mystery set against the backdrop of familiar Persona 3 elements " , and while this element adds " an interesting twist " to the dungeon crawl and social simulation gameplay , it also causes the plot to " slow down or suffer " . Hyper 's Tim Henderson commended the game for " willfully embellish [ ing ] absurd urban legends and other ideas with such assured consistency that the resulting whole is <unk> [ y ] coherent " . However , he criticized it for the narrative 's sluggish pace and for how he felt the game is " lacking in elaborate set @-@ pieces " . 1UP.com called Persona 4 a " stylish murder mystery " , the comparison given being a " small @-@ town Scooby @-@ Doo " adventure . 
 The game is also noted for its " significant portion of the story revolving around sexual themes " , as quoted from RPGFan 's Ryan Mattich . One of the playable characters given attention by reviewers is Kanji , who is considered to be one of the first characters in a mainstream video game to struggle with their sexual orientation , and Atlus has been commended for the inclusion of that character . Atlus USA has stated that they left Kanji 's sexual preferences ambiguous and up to the player ; however , there has been no word from developer Atlus Japan concerning the matter . According to Dr. Antonia Levi , author of Samurai from Outer Space : Understanding Japanese Animation , the questioning of Kanji 's sexuality in the script is a " comment on homosexuality in a greater Japanese social context " , in which " the notion of ' coming out ' is seen as undesirable ... as it necessarily involves adopting a confrontational stance against mainstream lifestyles and values " . Brenda Brathwaite , author of Sex in Video Games , thought it " would have been amazing if they would have made a concrete statement that [ Kanji ] is gay " , but was otherwise " thrilled " with the treatment of the character and the game 's representation of his " inner struggles and interactions with friends " .

 Persona 4 was awarded the " PlayStation 2 Game Prize " in the Famitsu Awards 2008 , voted by readers of Famitsu . It was also recognized by the Computer Entertainment Supplier 's Association as one of the recipients for the " Games of the Year Award of Excellence " in the Japan Game Awards 2009 . The game was given the award for its " high quality of work " , " excellent story , automatically generated dungeons and impressive background music " . In 2013 , GamesRadar ranked it fifth " best videogame stories ever " , saying its " greatest strength comes from pacing " . In 2015 , GamesRadar named Persona 4 Golden the 53rd best game ever on its " The 100 best games ever " list . In that same year , USgamer placed the game fifth on its " The 15 Best Games Since 2000 " list . 
 = Devika Rani = 
 Devika Rani Chaudhuri , usually known as Devika Rani ( 30 March 1908 – 9 March 1994 ) , was an actress in Indian films who was active during the 1930s and 1940s . Widely acknowledged as the first lady of Indian cinema , Devika Rani had a successful film career that spanned 10 years . 
 Devika Rani 's early years were mostly spent in London where she studied architecture , and started her career as a textile engineer . In 1928 , she met Himanshu Rai , an Indian film @-@ producer , who persuaded her to join his production crew . She assisted in costumes design and art direction for Rai 's film A Throw of Dice ( 1929 ) . The two married in 1929 , and went to Germany where Devika Rani learned different aspects of film @-@ making in the UFA Studios in Berlin . Rai then cast her in the 1933 talkie Karma in which her performance received critical acclaim . Returning to India , the couple established their production studio Bombay Talkies in 1934 . They produced many women @-@ centric films throughout the decade , with Devika Rani portraying lead roles in most of them . Her on @-@ screen pairing with Ashok Kumar became popular in India . 
 Following Rai 's death in 1940 , Devika Rani took over the control of the studio and produced several films . At the peak of her career she retired from films , and in 1945 she married Russian painter Svetoslav Roerich , leading thereafter life of a recluse . Her persona and roles in films were often considered socially unconventional . Her awards include the <unk> ( 1958 ) , Dadasaheb Phalke Award ( 1970 ) and the Soviet Land Nehru Award ( 1990 ) . 
 = = Family and background = = 
 Devika Rani was born into a Bengali family in Waltair near Visakhapatnam in present @-@ day Andhra Pradesh . Her father , Col. Manmatha Nath Chaudhuri , was the first Indian Surgeon @-@ General of Madras Presidency . Her paternal uncles were Ashutosh Chaudhuri , Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court , the prominent Kolkata @-@ based barrister <unk> Chandra Chaudhuri and the Bengali writer <unk> Chaudhuri . 
 Devika Rani was related through both her parents to the poet and Nobel Laureate Rabindranath <unk> 's mother , Leela Devi Chaudhuri , was the daughter of Indumati Devi Chattopadhyay , whose mother <unk> Devi Gangopadhyay was the eldest sister of the Nobel laureate . In other words , Devika 's paternal and maternal grandmothers were first cousins to each other , being the daughters of two sisters of Rabindranath Tagore . 
 Devika Rani 's childhood was mostly spent in England ; at the age of nine she moved to the country where she was enrolled in a boarding school . After completing her schooling in the early 1920s , she got an admission from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art ( RADA ) and the Royal Academy of Music in London to study acting and music . She followed that with a course in architecture , textile and decor design , and apprenticed under Elizabeth Arden . Upon completion , Devika Rani started her career as textile engineer . 
 = = Himanshu Rai = = 
 In 1928 Devika Rani first met her future husband , Himanshu Rai . Rai , an Indian barrister @-@ turned @-@ film maker , was in London preparing to shoot his forthcoming film A Throw of Dice . Rai was impressed with Devika 's " exceptional skills " and invited her to join the production team of the film , although not as an actress . She readily agreed , and traveled to India with Himanshu Rai for this assignment , assisting him in areas such as costume designing and art direction . The two also traveled to Germany for the post @-@ production work , where she had occasion to observe the film @-@ making techniques of the German film industry , specifically of G. W. Pabst and Fritz Lang . Inspired by their methods of film @-@ making , she enrolled for a film @-@ making course at Universum Film AG studio in Berlin . Devika Rani learnt various aspects of film @-@ making and additionally also took a special course in film acting . 
 In 1929 , shortly after the release of A Throw of Dice , Devika Rani and Himanshu Rai were married . Around this time , they both acted in a play together , for which they received many accolades in Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries . During this time she was also trained in the production unit of Max Reinhardt , an Austrian theatre director .

 Devika and Himanshu Rai returned to India , where Himanshu produced a film titled Karma ( 1933 ) . The film was his first talkie , and like his previous films , it was a joint production between people from India , Germany and the United Kingdom . Rai , who played the lead role , decided to cast Devika Rani as the female lead , thus marking her acting debut . Karma is credited as having been the first English language talkie made by an Indian . It was one of the earliest Indian films to feature a kissing scene . The kissing scene , involving Himanshu Rai and Devika Rani , lasted for about four minutes , and eighty years later , this stands as the record for duration of a kissing scene in Indian cinema as of 2014 . Devika Rani also sang a song in the film , a bi @-@ lingual song in English and Hindi . This song is said to be Bollywood 's first English song . 
 Made simultaneously in both English and Hindi , Karma premiered in London in May 1933 . Alongside a special screening for the Royal family at Windsor , the film was well received throughout Europe . Devika Rani 's performance was internationally acclaimed as she won " rave reviews " in the London media . A critic from The Daily Telegraph noted Devika Rani for her " beauty " and " charm " while also crediting her to be a " potential star of the first magnitude " . Following the release of the film , she was invited by the B.B.C. to enact a role in their first ever television broadcast in Britain in 1933 . She also inaugurated the company 's first short wave radio transmission to India . In spite of its success in England , Karma did not interest Indian audiences and turned out be a failure in India when it was released in Hindi as Nagin Ki Ragini in early 1934 . However , the film received good critical response and helped Devika Rani establish herself as a leading actress in Indian cinema . Indian independence activist and poet Sarojini Naidu called her a " lovely and gifted little lady " .

 After the critical success of Karma , the couple returned to India in 1934 . Although the Hindi version of the film , released in India in 1934 , flopped without a trace , Himanshu Rai had established the required networks in Europe , and was able to start a film studio named Bombay Talkies , partnering with Niranjan Pal , a Bengali playwright and screenwriter who he had met previously in London , and Franz Osten , who directed several of Rai 's films . 
 Upon inception , Bombay Talkies was one of the " best @-@ equipped " film studios in the country . The studio would serve as a launch pad for future actors including Ashok Kumar , Leela <unk> , Dilip Kumar , Raj Kapoor , Madhubala and Mumtaz . The studio 's first film Jawani Ki Hawa ( 1935 ) , a crime thriller , starring Devika Rani and Najm @-@ ul @-@ Hassan , was shot fully on a train . 
 = = = Elopement = = = 
 Najm @-@ ul @-@ Hassan was also Devika 's co @-@ star in the studio 's next venture , Jeevan Naiya . The two co @-@ stars developed a romantic relationship , and during the shooting schedule of Jeevan Naiya , Devika , a married Hindu woman , eloped with Hassan , a married Muslim man . Himanshu was both enraged and distraught . Since the leading pair were absent , production was stalled . A significant portion of the movie had been shot and a large sum of money , which had been taken as credit from <unk> , had been spent . The studio therefore suffered severe financial losses and a loss of credit among bankers in the city while the runaway couple made merry . 
 Sashadhar Mukherjee , an assistant sound @-@ engineer at the studio , had a brotherly bond with Devika Rani because both of them were Bengalis and spoke that language with each other . He established contact with the runaway couple and managed to convince Devika Rani to return to her husband . In the India of that era , divorce was legally almost impossible and women who eloped were regarded as no better than whores and were shunned by their own families . In her heart of hearts , Devika Rani knew that she could not secure a divorce or marry Hassan under any circumstances . She negotiated with her husband through the auspices of Sashadhar Mukherjee , seeking the separation of her finances from those of her husband as a condition for her return . Henceforth , she would be paid separately for working in his films , but he would be required to single @-@ handedly pay the household expenses for the home in which both of them would live . Himanshu agreed to this , in order to save face in society and to prevent his studio from going bankrupt . Devika Rani returned to her marital home . However , things would never be the same between husband and wife again , and it is said that thenceforth , their relationship was largely confined to work and little or no intimacy transpired between them after this episode . 
 Despite the additional expense involved in re @-@ shooting many portions of the film , Himanshu Rai replaced Najm @-@ ul @-@ Hassan with Ashok Kumar , who was the brother of Sashadhar Mukherjee 's wife , as the hero of Jeevan Naiya . This marked the debut , improbable as it may seem , of Ashok Kumar 's five @-@ decade @-@ long career in Hindi films . Najm @-@ ul @-@ Hassan was dismissed from his job at Bombay Talkies ( this was the period in which actors and actresses were paid regular monthly salaries by one specific film studio and could not work in any other studio ) . His reputation as a dangerous cad established , he could not find work in any other studio . His career was ruined and he sank into obscurity . 
 = = = Golden era of Bombay Talkies = = = 
 <unk> Kanya ( 1936 ) , the studio 's next production was a tragedy drama that had Devika Rani and Ashok Kumar portraying the roles of an untouchable girl and a Brahmin boy who fall in love . The film is considered a " landmark " in Indian cinema as it challenged the caste system in the country . The casting of Devika Rani was considered a mismatch as her looks did not match the role of a poor untouchable girl by virtue of her " upper @-@ class upbringing " . However , her pairing with Ashok Kumar became popular and they went on to star in as many as ten films together with most of them being Bombay Talkies productions . 
 In the 1930s , Bombay Talkies produced several women @-@ centric films with Devika Rani playing the lead role in all of them . In majority of the films produced by the studio , she was paired opposite Ashok Kumar , who was " overshadowed " by her . Jeevan Prabhat , released in 1937 , saw a role @-@ reversal between Devika Rani and Ashok Kumar — she played a higher @-@ caste Brahmin woman who is mistaken by society of having an extra @-@ marital affair with an untouchable man . Her next release Izzat ( 1937 ) , based on Romeo and Juliet , was set in the medieval period and depicted two lovers belonging to enemy clans of a Maratha empire . Nirmala , released in the following year , dealt with the plight of a child @-@ less woman who is told by an astrologer to abandon her husband to ensure successful pregnancy . In <unk> , her second release of the year , she played a Rajput princess . Durga , her only release in 1939 , was a romantic drama that told the story of an orphaned girl and a village doctor , played by Ashok Kumar . 
 = = = Widowhood and studio decline = = = 
 Following the death of Rai in 1940 , there was a rift between two parties of the Bombay Talkies led by Mukherjee and <unk> Chakravarty . Devika Rani assumed principal responsibility and took over the studio along with Mukherjee . In 1941 , she produced and acted in <unk> co @-@ starring Ashok Kumar . In the subsequent years , she produced two successful films under the studio — Basant and Kismet — both starring Ashok Kumar . Kismet ( 1943 ) contained anti @-@ British messages ( India was under British rule at that time ) and turned out to be a " record @-@ breaking " film . Devika Rani made her last film appearance in Hamari Baat ( 1943 ) , which had Raj Kapoor playing a small role . She handpicked newcomer Dilip Kumar for a role in <unk> <unk> ( 1944 ) , produced by her on behalf of the studio . An internal politics that arose in the studio led prominent personalities including Mukherjee and Ashok Kumar to part ways with her and set up a new studio called Filmistan . Due to lack of support and interest , Devika Rani decided to quit the film industry . In an interview to journalist Raju <unk> , she mentioned that her idea of not willing to compromise on " artistic values " of film @-@ making as one of the major reasons for her quitting the industry . 
 = = Roerich and retirement = = 
 Following her retirement from films , Devika Rani married Russian painter Svetoslav Roerich , son of Russian artist Nicholas Roerich , in 1945 . After marriage , the couple moved to Manali , Himachal Pradesh where they got acquainted with the Nehru family . During her stay in Manali , Devika Rani made a few documentaries on wildlife . After staying in Manali for some years , they moved to Bangalore , Karnataka , and settled there managing an export company . The couple bought a 450 acres ( 1 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 m2 ) estate on the outskirts of the city and led a solitary life for the rest of their lives . She died of bronchitis on 9 March 1994 — a year after Roerich died — in Bangalore . At her funeral , Devika Rani was given full state honors . Following her death , the estate was on litigation for many years as the couple had no legal claimants ; Devika Rani remained childless throughout her life . In August 2011 , the Government of Karnataka acquired the estate after the Supreme Court of India passed the verdict in favour of them . 
 = = Persona and legacy = = 
 Devika Rani was called the first lady of Indian cinema . She is credited for being one of the earliest personalities who took the position of Indian cinema to global standards . Her films were mostly tragic romantic dramas that contained social themes . The roles played by her in films of Bombay Talkies usually involved in romantic relationship with men who were unusual for the social norms prevailing in the society at that time , mainly for their caste background or community identity . Devika Rani was highly influenced by the German cinema by virtue of her training at the UFA Studios ; Although she was influenced by German actress Marlene Dietrich , her acting style was compared to Greta Garbo , thus leading to Devika Rani being named the " Indian Garbo " . Devika Rani 's attire , both in films and sometimes in real life , were considered " risque " at that time . In his book Bless You Bollywood ! : A tribute to Hindi Cinema on completing 100 years , Tilak Rishi mentions that Devika Rani was known as the " Dragon Lady " for her " smoking , drinking , cursing and hot temper " . 
 In 1958 , the Government of India honoured Devika Rani with a Padma Shri , the country 's fourth highest civilian honour . She became the first ever recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award , the country 's highest award for films , when it was instituted in 1969 . In 1990 , Soviet Russia honoured her with the " Soviet Land Nehru Award " . A postage stamp commemorating her was released by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology in February 2011 .

 = Dark shyshark = 
 The dark shyshark or pretty Happy ( Haploblepharus pictus ) is a species of catshark , belonging to the family Scyliorhinidae , endemic to the temperate waters off southern Namibia and western South Africa . It is benthic in nature and inhabits shallow , inshore waters and favors rocky reefs and kelp forests . Growing to 60 cm ( 24 in ) long , this small , stocky shark has a wide , flattened head with a rounded snout and a large flap of skin extending from before the nostrils to the mouth . Its dorsal coloration is extremely variable and may feature black @-@ edged orange to blackish saddles and / or white spots on a light brown to nearly black background . 
 When threatened , the dark shyshark curls into a ring with its tail covering its eyes , hence the name " shyshark " . It preys mainly on small crustaceans , bony fishes , and molluscs . Reproduction is oviparous and proceeds throughout the year . Females lay two egg cases at a time , which hatch after 6 – 10 months . This harmless species is of little commercial significance due to its small size . It is frequently caught by recreational fishers and persecuted as a pest . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the dark shyshark under Least Concern , as it is common and does not appear to be substantially threatened by fishing or habitat degradation . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 German physicians and biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle originally described the dark shyshark in their 1838 – 41 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen , based on five specimens caught off the Cape of Good Hope and deposited in the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden , The Netherlands . Because of the shark 's ornate coloration , they gave it the specific epithet <unk> from the Latin for " painted " . Originally placed in the now @-@ obsolete genus Scyllium , subsequent authors moved this species to the genus Haploblepharus , coined by American zoologist Samuel Garman in 1913 . 
 The dark shyshark was often regarded to be the same as the puffadder shyshark ( H. edwardsii ) until 1975 , with the publication of A.J. Bass , Jeanette D <unk> , and Nat <unk> 's review of southern African sharks . It continues to be confused for the other three shyshark species because of its extremely variable coloration . The common name " pretty Happy " ( " Happy " refers to the genus name Haploblepharus ) was recently introduced to the public as an easily remembered alternative to the colloquial names " shyshark " and " doughnut " , which can apply to several species and have confounded research efforts . Brett Human 's 2006 phylogenetic analysis , based on three mitochondrial DNA genes , found that the dark shyshark and the brown shyshark ( H. fuscus ) are sister species , and that the two make up the more derived clade within the genus . 
 = = Description = = 
 Reaching no more than 60 cm ( 24 in ) long , the dark shyshark differs from other shysharks in that it is slender @-@ bodied when juvenile and stocky @-@ bodied when adult . Its head is short , wide , and flattened , with a bluntly rounded snout and very large nostrils . The anterior rims of the nostrils bear greatly enlarged lobes of skin , which are fused into a single flap that reaches the mouth ; the flap conceals the nasal excurrent openings and a pair of grooves that run between them and the mouth . The large , horizontally oval eyes are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) , and have strong ridges beneath . The mouth is short but wide and bears furrows at the corners extending onto both jaws . There are 45 – 83 upper and 47 – 75 lower tooth rows ; each tooth has a long central cusp flanked by a pair of smaller cusplets . The five pairs of gill slits are located fairly high on the body . 
 The two dorsal fins are of nearly equal size and placed far back on the body , with the first originating over the latter third of the pelvic fin bases and the second over the latter half of the anal fin base . The pectoral and pelvic fins are broad and rounded ; the males have stout claspers . The pelvic and anal fins are about as large as the dorsal fins . The broad caudal fin comprises about a fifth of the total body length and has a strong notch near the tip of the upper lobe and an indistinct lower lobe . The skin is thick and covered by well @-@ calcified arrowhead @-@ shaped dermal denticles . The coloration of the dark shyshark is highly variable , and particular individuals can resemble any of the other shyshark species . The background color ranges from light brown to reddish to grayish to almost black above , transitioning abruptly to white or cream below , sometimes with dark blotches beneath the paired fins . There may be 6 – 8 orange , brown , or blackish variably shaped saddles along the back and tail , edged more or less obviously in black . There may also be white spots within or within and between the saddles . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The range of the dark shyshark is restricted to the coastal waters of southern Africa , from north of Lüderitz in southern Namibia to east of the Storms River mouth in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa . It is abundant , particularly west of Cape Agulhas . This species is a bottom @-@ dweller found close inshore , from the intertidal zone to a depth of 35 m ( 115 ft ) . It prefers rocky reefs and kelp forests , but also presumably traverses sandy flats in between patches of more suitable habitat . As this shark is not known to travel long distances , there is likely subpopulation differentiation across parts of its range . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The dark shyshark is a generalist predator whose main food sources are , in descending order of importance , small benthic crustaceans , bony fishes , and molluscs . Larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans . Polychaete worms and echinoderms are also taken on occasion , and algae may be swallowed incidentally . This species is preyed upon by the broadnose sevengill shark ( Notorynchus cepedianus ) , and potentially also other large fishes and marine mammals . When threatened , it adopts a characteristic defense posture in which it curls into a ring with its tail over its eyes ; this behavior likely makes the shark harder to swallow and is the origin of the common names " shyshark " and " doughnut " . In captivity , the whelks Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria have been documented piercing the egg cases of this species and extracting the yolk . A known parasite of the dark shyshark is the trypanosome Trypanosoma <unk> , which infests the blood . 
 Like other members of its genus , the dark shyshark is oviparous ; adult females have a single functional ovary and two functional oviducts . There appears to be no distinct breeding season and reproduction occurs year @-@ round . Females produce mature eggs two at a time , one per oviduct . The eggs are enclosed in purse @-@ shaped capsules measuring 5 @.@ 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) long and 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) across ; each capsule is plain amber to dark brown in color and bears thin , coiled tendrils at the four corners . In one observation of an egg that hatched after 104 days , the developing embryo had external gill filaments until it was 50 days old , and completely absorbed its yolk sac shortly before hatching . Eggs in nature typically hatch in 6 – 10 months , with the newly hatched shark measuring 10 – 12 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) long . Both sexes grow at approximately the same rate , reaching sexual maturity at around 15 years of age . Mature males and females range from 40 – 57 cm ( 16 – 22 in ) and 36 – 60 cm ( 14 – 24 in ) long respectively . The maximum lifespan is 25 years . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The dark shyshark poses no danger to humans and is too small to be of commercial importance . Many are hooked by sport fishers casting from the shore , who regard the shark as a pest and often kill it . It may also be caught by subsistence fishers and in lobster traps and bottom trawls , though not in substantial quantities . This shark occasionally finds its way into the aquarium trade , though there is no direct fishing for this purpose . As the dark shyshark remains common and does not seem heavily threatened by human activity , it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . Its small range does raise concerns that an increase in regional fishing pressure or habitat degradation could impact the entire population .
