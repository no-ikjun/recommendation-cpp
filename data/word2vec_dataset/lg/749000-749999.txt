 = Make It Happen ( Mariah Carey song ) = 
 " Make It Happen " is a song by American singer @-@ songwriter Mariah Carey . Written and produced by Carey and C + C Music Factory 's David Cole and Robert Clivillés , it was released on April 4 , 1992 , by Columbia Records as the third single from her second studio album , Emotions ( 1991 ) . The <unk> , R & B- , and dance @-@ influenced track incorporates traces of gospel in its bridge and crescendo . Described by author Chris Nickson as Carey 's most personal and inspirational song ( up until " Hero " ) , it tells of her personal struggles prior to her rise to fame , and how her faith in God helped sustain her . 
 The song was praised by music critics , many of whom applauded Carey 's incorporation of several musical genres , as well as the song 's personalized lyrical content . Aside from its critical acceptance , " Make It Happen " was successful in the United States , but charted weakly internationally compared to her previous singles . It peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and finished at number 42 on Billboard 's Year @-@ End Chart . The song reached number 7 in Canada and the top 40 in the United Kingdom and Australia , but did not reach the top 50 in the Netherlands and Germany . 
 The song 's music video was filmed in a cathedral @-@ like church . A benefit event inside , titled " Save Our Church " , features Carey as the main performer , leading a choir in song as she sings to the constant cheering and applause of the crowd . Aside from the video 's message of prayer and religion , the video features men and women of different backgrounds . Carey included the song on the set lists of all of her concert tours throughout her career , and the track was included on her compilation albums Greatest Hits ( 2001 ) , Playlist : The Very Best of Mariah Carey ( 2010 ) , and The Essential Mariah Carey ( 2012 ) .

 As a child , Carey lived with her mother Patricia in a small apartment on Long Island , New York . They were poor and had to move several times as Patricia found different jobs . As a result , Carey frequently transferred into different schools , and at the age of seventeen , she moved into a small Manhattan studio with other young women to pursue a career in music . She had already begun working on her demo tape with Ben Margulies , a classmate at her school in Huntington , Long Island . During this period , she lived a lifestyle of poverty , often sharing a box of spaghetti with her five roommates and wearing torn shoes . She held several jobs , while juggling school , writing , and recording music . 
 After graduating from high school , Carey invested more time into her music while working sporadically at different jobs . She began working for Puerto Rican singer Brenda K. Starr as a background singer , hoping to find new opportunities and meet important record executives along the way . At a gala for Sony executives , Starr gave a copy of Carey 's demo tape to Tommy Mottola , CEO of Columbia Records . Mottola was sufficiently impressed with the tape to sign Carey to the label . Two years later in 1991 , Carey was well under way writing and recording material for her second studio album , Emotions ( 1991 ) . During the months spent conceptualizing the album , Carey decided to write a song that would illustrate her lifestyle prior to her success . She felt listeners ' hearing her rags @-@ to @-@ riches story might inspire them to pursue their dreams . As a result , Carey wrote what was described by author Chris Nickson as her " most inspirational song " ( up until " Hero " ) , titled " Make It Happen " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Following the success of her self @-@ titled debut album , Carey desired to pen her personal struggles prior to her signing with Columbia . She hoped to give her fans an idea of what her life two years prior and to instill relief or inspiration in them . In the song , Carey sings " Not more than three short years ago / I was abandoned and alone / Without a penny to my name / So very young and so afraid / No proper shoes upon my feet / Sometimes I couldn 't even eat / I often cried myself to sleep . " Later in the song , Carey sings " But still I had to keep on going / I struggled and I prayed / And finally found my way , " retelling how her faith helped guide her until her career blossomed and expressing to listeners the importance of finding and connecting with God . Author Chris Nickson wrote the following regarding the song , its lyrics and composition : 
 That wasn 't just a faith in herself and her talent , but also the ability to let herself go , to pray to God , and to trust in what would happen . These were , by far , her most inspiring words to date , letting others know that no matter what they were doing , no matter how difficult things were , with help they would win through . Musically , the piece had a restrained dance beat , very <unk> , that owed a little more to gospel , with a chorus - sung by Mariah , Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from the verse to repeat and drive and its very positive message home . 
 " Make It Happen " is a dance track that draws influence from pop , R & B , gospel , and dance @-@ pop genres ; its tempo is 108 beats per minute . The song was written and produced by Carey and C + C Music Factory 's David Cole and Robert Clivillés , and it was released as the third and final single from her second studio album , Emotions . It employs several musical instruments , including the piano , guitar , bass , organ , and tambourine . Additionally , Carey incorporated a church choir into the track 's bridge , which , according to Nickson , helped the song become even more of an anthem . The song is set in common time and is composed in the key of D major . Carey 's vocal range spans from the low @-@ note of C3 to the high @-@ note of G5 , while the song 's chorus follows a chord progression of Gsus2 – G – G / F ♯ – Em7 – G / D – C – G / B – Am7 .

 " Make It Happen " has received acclaim from music critics , many of whom complimented its uplifting lyrical content . Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine named the song one of his top two picks from Emotions , while Jon Pareles from The New York Times called it an " uplifting pop @-@ gospel homily " . Steve Morse of The Boston Globe wrote : " [ Its ] positive message also soars through a gospel rearrangement . After hearing it , we understand why [ Carey named ] gospel star Shirley Caesar ... such a strong influence " . In a different review of the album , Morse called " Make It Happen " " glorious " and described it as " a clear slice of spiritual autobiography " . In a review for Carey 's Greatest Hits in December 2001 , Devon Powers from PopMatters called the song 's lyrics " power through prayer " and described some of its vocals as having " churchy overtones " . Rob Tannenbaum from Rolling Stone described the track as " a teary tale of how she kept her religious faith despite hard times " , while complimenting its " overheated [ vocal ] growling . " Chicago Tribune editor Jan DeKnock called it " upbeat " and " inspirational " , while Mellisa A. Jacque from the St. Petersburg Times wrote " Carey evokes a deep @-@ felt strength and love for life , and the music has a jazzy feel in its sparsity " . Chicago Sun @-@ Times critic Michael Corcoran called it a " so @-@ so composition " and described it as a " zombie dance @-@ pop " production , though he said the song was salvaged by Carey 's " stunning vocals " . 
 = = = Copyright lawsuit = = = 
 Carey , Cole , Clivillés and Sony Music Entertainment were sued in June 1994 by songwriter Kevin McCord , who accused the party of incorporating significant musical elements from his 1979 song , " I Want to Thank You " , into " Make It Happen " . McCord said , " If you listen to the chords at the beginning of the song , the similarity is obvious . It 's the exact same chords in a different key " ; he also noted lyrical similarities . Carey 's side initially claimed McCord had no standing to sue , but McCord 's attorney showed the song 's copyright owners had transferred their legal interest in " I Want to Thank You " to McCord " in an effort to adjudicate their claims " . Though a Carey spokesperson maintained the copyright infringement allegations were false , McCord said he had turned down settlement offers from Carey 's camp . McCord eventually accepted a settlement offer of about US $ 500 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Chart performance = = 
 Carey 's debut album sold over 15 million copies globally and produced four chart @-@ topping singles on the Billboard Hot 100 . Although " Emotions " became Carey 's fifth chart @-@ topping single in the US , sales for the album , Emotions , stalled . As sales of Emotions continued to plummet , Columbia released " Make It Happen " as the third worldwide single from the album . Following a strong promotional boost for the song , it only peaked at number 5 on the Hot 100 , becoming Carey 's lowest charting US single to that point . It remained in the top 40 for 16 weeks and was ranked at number 42 on Billboard 's 1992 Year @-@ End Chart . On the February 22 , 1992 , issue of RPM , " Make It Happen " debuted at number 97 on the Canadian singles chart . On May 16 , the song reached its peak position of number 7 , staying in the singles chart for 19 weeks . 
 The song 's charting throughout Australia and Europe was weak in comparison to Carey 's previous singles . On the May 10 , 1992 , Australian Singles Chart , " Make It Happen " debuted at number 45 . The following week , it rose to its peak of number 35 , and spent five weeks within the chart . Similarly , in the Netherlands , the song attained a peak of 59 and spent only five weeks in the Dutch Top 100 . The song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 20 on the week ending April 18 , 1992 . The following week , the song rose three spots to its peak position and charted for five weeks . " Make It Happen " was awarded a BMI Pop Award in 1992 . 
 = = Music video = = 
 The music video for " Make It Happen " was directed by Marcus Nispel and features Carey performing at a closing church . A benefit being depicted within , titled " Save Our Church " , involves several other churchgoers who have congregated there to raise money through song . As the video begins , inspectors enter the building , searching the premises prior to its closing . Soon after , however , Carey makes her way to the stage with a few background singers and is soon joined inside the edifice by swarming groups of religious individuals . As she begins playing the song , an additional choir forms on the small stage with several small children on the upper tiers . Several musicians enter the room as the video progresses . 
 Towards the video 's climax , the crowd cheers Carey and begin clapping and chanting praises . Nispel said he added additional raw sounds , such as cheers , praises , and shouts , into the video in order make it feel like a " real , live experience " . In his biography of Carey , Nickson noted the inclusion of men , women , and children of different races and ages : " The video tried to incorporate and further the song 's image of religious belief and racial equality . The audience , as they filled into the dusty and deserted building , was made up of the widest cross section possible : old and young ( with a strong emphasis on the children ) , <unk> and disabled , all races and color . " 
 = = Live performances = = 
 Carey has performed " Make It Happen " on live television , during charity appearances , and on numerous concert tours . Her first live performance of the song was an acoustic version on the television show MTV Unplugged in 1992 , which was later released on the EP entitled MTV Unplugged ( 1992 ) . Carey 's performance was recorded on March 16 , 1992 , at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens , New York . The show featured several musicians , back @-@ up vocalists , and a crew of ten just for the filming and recording . The show was directed by Larry Jordan , who had previously worked with Carey on the music video set for " Someday " . Nickson felt the song was superior to the studio version , due to its stripped performance and vocals : 
 The roughness of this version succeeded in a way the recorded version on ' Emotions ' could never manage . In the sterile atmosphere of a studio , where perfection , technology , and overdubbing were the rules , spontaneity had no place . On the stage , it was valued , and this performance had it . Everyone pushed everyone just a little further , to create something wonderful , and judging by the response , the audience realized it , as did Mariah when the song was finished . It was a rare moment , one that true performers strive for and don 't find often enough to satisfy themselves . 
 Carey performed " Make It Happen " at an intimate concert at Proctor Theatre in New York on July 15 , 1993 . The concert was released as the home video Here Is Mariah Carey ( 1993 ) . At the VH1 Divas taping in 1998 , Carey was the opening performer of the event , and after " My All " , her single at the time , she followed with " Make It Happen " . As during the usual live performances of the song , a gospel choir accompanied her . On July 2 , 2005 , a benefit concert was held in Hyde Park , London , titled Live 8 . The televised event was watched by over 9 @.@ 6 million Britons and attended by over 200 @,@ 000 . Carey performed a three song set list , opening with " Make It Happen " followed by " Hero " and " We Belong Together " , featuring a live choir of African children during the first two songs . On April 12 , 2005 , Carey performed the song as part of a three @-@ song concert for Good Morning America , drawing the biggest crowd in Times Square since December 2004 . Following a live rendition of " It 's Like That " with Jermaine Dupri , Carey was joined on stage by several male and female vocalists , all wearing white gowns and serving as a gospel choir . Similarly , on October 2 , 2009 , Carey played a four @-@ song set list at Rockefeller Center for a taping of The Today Show . " Make It Happen " was performed with a church choir and children 's quartet . 
 Aside from the televised appearances and charity events , " Make It Happen " was featured on the set lists of several of Carey 's world tours . The song was routinely performed on the Music Box Tour and the Daydream World Tour in 1993 and early @-@ mid 1996 , respectively . During her first show at Japan 's Tokyo Dome on March 7 , 1996 , Carey performed the song alongside a twenty @-@ five person choir and several additional musicians and background vocalists . " Make It Happen " was featured on Carey 's Butterfly World Tour in early 1998 , during which she was joined on stage by several choir members and musicians . Similarly , two years later , the song was placed as the ninth song on the set list during select dates of her Rainbow World Tour . Similar set @-@ ups were featured for her following Charmbracelet World Tour and The Adventures of Mimi Tour , where church choirs were brought out for the song , in addition to additional background vocalists and musicians . In the Angels Advocate Tour , the song served as a dancer 's interlude ; Carey entered during the bridge of the song . On September 26 , 2010 , during the song 's performance in a show in Singapore for that tour , Carey slipped on stage , and the small slip was blamed on Carey 's US $ 10 @,@ 000 heels . She asked her assistant to remove them and completed the concert barefoot .

 = Phaeacius = 
 Phaeacius is a spider genus of the family Salticidae ( jumping spiders ) , found in sub @-@ tropical China and between India and the Malay Peninsula , including Sri Lanka , Sumatra and the Philippines . Although other spiders can jump , salticids including Phaeacius have significantly better vision than other spiders , and their main eyes are more acute in daylight than a cat 's and 10 times more acute than a dragonfly 's . The main eyes focus accurately on an object at distances from approximately 2 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) to infinity , and in practice can see up to about 75 centimetres ( 30 in ) . 
 While most jumping spiders are active hunters , Phaeacius is unusually sedentary , generally resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs , tree barks , pieces of wood or any other solid surface , where it is very well camouflaged . Its preferred prey is moths and other insects , and jumping spiders . Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius , or even over its body , but if the insect moves between the spider 's first pair of legs , Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey . Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach , especially if without prey for a week or more . Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary , and moves away if it touches one accidentally . It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs , but cannot escape from very sticky webs . 
 The closest relatives of Phaeacius are in the genus Holcolaetis , and the next closest genera are Portia and Spartaeus . 
 = = Body structure = = 
 Spiders are chelicerates , which differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into only two tagmata , the cephalothorax and abdomen . Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular carapace . : 51 All spiders ' abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen . The cephalothorax and abdomen are joined by a small , cylindrical pedicel , which allows the abdomen to move while spinning silk . : 571 – 574 While most jumping spiders do not build webs to catch prey , they use silk for other purposes , including moulting and laying eggs . : 495 
 The whole body of Phaeacius is 7 @.@ 5 to 11 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 30 to 0 @.@ 45 in ) long , and notably flattened , including the carapace , while the carapaces of some other groups are raised . : 495 The <unk> of Phaeacius ′ is relatively long , and the highest point is a little behind the last pair of eyes . : 204 , 206 @-@ 208 Phaeacius is very well camouflaged ; for example , P. <unk> has a body with dull grey and brown markings that resemble the surface of tree trunks in the rainforest . 
 Jumping spiders generally have large forelegs and short , powerful back legs , and can leap up to 50 times their own length by powerfully extending the third or fourth pairs of legs . : 578 : 495 In spiders and other chelicerates , there is only one pair of appendages before the mouth , and in spiders these are modified into fangs that inject poison into the prey . Behind the mouth is a pair of pedipalps ( " palps " for short ) , and those of male spiders are quite large and are used for displaying and mating . 
 = = Senses = = 
 Jumping spiders have eight eyes , the two large ones in the centre @-@ and @-@ front position ( the anterior @-@ median eyes , also called " principal eyes " : 51 ) providing acute vision and housed in tubes in the head . The other six are secondary eyes , positioned along the sides of the carapace and acting mainly as movement detectors . : 16 While the middle pair of secondary eyes in most jumping spiders are small , those of Phaeacius and other members of the sub @-@ family Spartaeinae are almost as large as the other secondary eyes . Although other spiders can jump , salticids including Phaeacius have significantly better vision than other spiders , : 521 and their main eyes are more acute in daylight than a cat 's and 10 times more acute than a dragonfly 's . The main eyes focus accurately on an object at distances from approximately 2 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) to infinity , : 51 and in practice can see up to about 75 centimetres ( 30 in ) . : 53 
 Spiders , like other arthropods , have sensors , often modified setae ( bristles ) , protruding through their cuticle ( " skin " ) for smell , taste , touch and vibration . : 532 – 533 Unlike insects , spiders and other chelicerates do not have antennae . 
 = = Movement and being undetected = = 
 While most jumping spiders walk quickly , in a stop @-@ go gait and jumping over obstacles , the movements of Phaeacius are very unusual . Phaeacius usually uses a " flattened posture " head @-@ down on a vertical surface , with the body , legs and palps pressed against the surface , the hindmost legs upwards and the other legs downwards , : 496 – 497 and its markings and flattened body make it easily hidden against the bark of a tree trunk . Its habit of walking with its body and legs flattened against a surface helps Phaeacius to be unobtrusive . 
 = = Feeding and defence = = 
 While almost all jumping spiders are predators , mostly preying on insects , on other spiders , and on other arthropods , Phaeacius does not use the usual hunting tactics . : 502 Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day , so that they maximise their chances of a catch , and jump on their prey and then bite it . Unlike most jumping spiders , Phaeacius and other <unk> do not leap on prey , but lunge from about half the predator 's body length away . 
 Phaeacius is unusually sedentary for a jumping spider , generally resting in the flattened pose for hours or days on logs , pieces of wood or any other solid surface , : 502 and captures particular types of prey more often when the predator matches this background . Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius , or even over its body or legs . However , if the insect moves between the spider 's first pair of legs , Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly , driving its body upward 2 to 3 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 079 to 0 @.@ 118 in ) and forward about half the length of its body . The lunge ends with the spider 's fangs in the prey and often with the foremost two pairs of legs forming a basket over the prey . When the prey stops struggling , Phaeacius resumes the flattened pose and then feeds . : 502 
 However , Phaeacius can adopt other , more active approaches , with different gaits for each . If an insect remains almost stationary while Phaeacius is in the flattened pose and facing the insect , the spider may step slowly forward to its prey , rocking and keeping its flattened pose . To rock , Phaeacius moves about half a body length forward then , without pausing , smoothly back almost to the previous position . It performs about 10 cycles of those movements , progressing by 1 to 2 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 039 to 0 @.@ 079 in ) per cycle , and then rests . : 502 – 504 This rocking motion may disguise Phaeacius as shadows on the tree trunk . : 514 – 515 The insect occasionally keeps stationary until Phaeacius reaches within about half a body length and then lunges . : 502 – 504 
 When hunting other jumping spiders and when the background matches its coloration , Phaeacius uses " insinuation " , in which it waits , sometimes up to an hour , while a jumping spider moves around nearby , and then Phaeacius suddenly turns up to 180 ° toward the prey and then resumes the flattened pose . Phaeacius then moves a few millimetres toward the prey and resumes the flattened pose . If the prey moves away , Phaeacius continues the insinuation manoeuvre , but if the prey moves toward it , Phaeacius lunges . Other jumping spiders show no awareness of a flattened Phaeacius on a matching background , and apparently survive by luck . : 502 – 504 When the background does not matches Phaeacius ′ coloration , other jumping spiders recognise Phaeacius as a threat . 
 Sometimes , especially if without prey for a week or more , Phaeacius may approach insects faster , from 50 to 100 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 9 in ) away , and if necessary turning round to face the prey . Often Phaeacius then adopts the flattened pose after the turn , but sometimes it walks faster than usual and , without pausing , lunges from about half its body length . : 502 – 504 
 In a test on a background matching its own coloration , Phaeacius was most successful against other salticids and then against moths , and was also successful against flies and hunting spiders . On a non @-@ matching background , Phaeacius was most successful against moths . 
 Phaeacius does not try to eat other spiders ' eggs , does not enter webs voluntarily , and moves away if it touches one accidentally . It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs , but cannot escape from very sticky webs . : 502 This behaviour is quite different from that of its close relative , Portia , which hunts actively and can enter any type of web to catch spiders and their eggs . : 491 
 When disturbed , some jumping spiders usually run away quickly and leap if chased . Phaeacius stays in its flattened posture unless harassed , when it runs quickly for about 100 to 300 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 to 11 @.@ 8 in ) and then adopts the flattened posture , and finally walks away about 10 minutes later . : 499 – 500 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 Before courtship , male spiders spin a small web and ejaculate on to it , and then store the semen in reservoirs on his pedipalps , : 581 – 583 which are larger than those of females . : 572 – 573 Phaeacius spins a flimsy silken , horizontal or vertical platform , about twice the spider 's length in diameter , to moult and lay eggs , but not at other times . After the moult , Phaeacius leaves the discarded exuvia hanging from the platform . A female 's egg sac is placed in a shallow cavity on the surface of a log . : 495 
 = = Taxonomy and distribution = = 
 Phaeacius is a spider genus of the Salticidae family ( jumping spiders ) . Phaeacius is in the subfamily Spartaeinae , which is thought to be primitive . : 491 Molecular phylogeny , a technique that compares the DNA of organisms to reconstruct the tree of life , indicates that Phaeacius is a member of the clade Spartaeinae , that Spartaeinae is basal ( quite similar to the ancestors of all jumping spiders ) , and that Phaeacius ′ s closest relative is the genus Holcolaetis , and that the next closest are Portia and Spartaeus . : 53 
 The genus is found in sub @-@ tropical China and between India and Malaya , including Sri Lanka , Sumatra and the Philippines .

 = Førde Airport , Øyrane = 
 Førde Airport , Øyrane ( IATA : FDE , ICAO : <unk> ; Norwegian : Førde lufthavn , Øyrane ) was a regional airport located at Øyrane in Førde , Norway . The municipal airport first opened as a water aerodrome , receiving a runway in 1970 . Scheduled services started the following year , with Widerøe providing flights to Bergen with the de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 6 Twin Otter . In addition , Førdefly and Airlift operated general aviation services from the airport . Førde Airport , Øyrane was located in the middle of an industrial area and had severe safety shortcomings , such as lacking an instrument landing system and had a control tower without sight of the entire runway . Øyrane was therefore replaced with Førde Airport , Bringeland in 1986 . 
 = = History = = 
 Large @-@ scale construction of airports in Norway started in the 1950s , largely funded by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) . Bergen Airport , Flesland opened in 1955 , followed by Ålesund Airport , Vigra in 1958 . The first plans for an airport in Sunnfjord were launched by Engineer Arne <unk> , who proposed building an airfield in Florø and having Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap operate to it using the Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer . Construction started in 1956 , but was halted after the airline could not guarantee operations during winter . 
 A committee , led by Erik Himle and later Preben Munthe , was appointed in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway . The Sud Aviation Caravelle was about to the phased into use on the main domestic routes and the committee recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners , including one airport in Florø . Widerøe came with an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead , which could be served using short take @-@ off and landing aircraft , which were being developed at the time . Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower cost than larger airports , but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate . Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal . The political rationale was that , despite that the total operating costs would rise , it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population . 
 The regional airports only received a simple terminal and a 800 @-@ meter ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) runway . The first such airports were opened in Helgeland in 1968 . Førde was declared as a " center of growth " in 1965 , which resulted in a series of public agencies and industrial enterprises being built in the town . The selection of Førde was tied to its central location within Sogn og Fjordane , as it was within a two @-@ hour drive from nearly the entire county . Immediately after the appointment , the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway started establishing an industrial facility at Øyrane . An industrial park opened 1968 , which included a shipyard . The surplus earthwork from dredging the port facilities was used to fill in land for a runway . The process went so quickly that the municipal council had not made a formal decision to build the airport before the groundwork was completed . 
 Andreas Hjelmeland established Førdefly in 1966 as the second airline based in Sogn og Fjordane . Førdefly never received a concession to operate scheduled services ; instead it flew a daily charter flight to Bergen Airport . The airline established a water aerodrome at Øyrane at the mouth of the river <unk> . The aerodrome had a passenger and freight terminal , a quay , a hangar and a control tower . The municipality received permission from the Ministry of Transport and Communications in mid 1970 to operate a municipal airport , and chose to use the terminal facilities operated by Førdefly . Construction of the runway cost 1 @.@ 3 million Norwegian krone and the first aircraft landed on the strip on 14 July 1970 . Scheduled services commenced on 1 July 1971 , the same day as Florø Airport , <unk> Airport , <unk> and Ørsta @-@ Volda Airport , <unk> opened . 
 From before the airport was built it was evident that the location was not well suited , and planning of an alternative location for the airport began in 1968 . The main concern was that the airport lacked an instrument landing system and could thus only be used during daylight and good weather . The first alternative location proposal was for <unk> , but was discarded by the Civil Aviation Administration because of the poor weather conditions . Later proposals were <unk> and then <unk> on the Sognefjord . By 1972 , the CAA had concluded that there probably was not a suitable location for an airport near Førde and recommended that the town instead by served by Florø Airport , located 70 kilometers ( 43 mi ) away . 
 Bringelandsåsen , located 16 kilometers ( 10 mi ) south of town , in the neighboring municipality of Gaular , was proposed by the CAA in 1974 . Plans were developed , and in 1983 the Ministry of Transport and Communications recommended that Øyrane be closed and replaced with an all @-@ new airport at Bringeland . Construction started in 1985 and the new airport opened on 31 August 1986 , taking over all scheduled traffic . The helicopter operator Airlift was established in 1986 and was based at Øyrane until 1988 , when it also moved to Bringeland . The terminal building at Øyrane remains , including the control tower and wharfs , although the runway and taxiway have been demolished to make way for industry . A small part of the runway close to the marina remains as a parking lot . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 Førde Airport , Øyrane was located in the industrial area Øyrane , immediately west of the town center of Førde . The terminal facilities were located on the shore of the river of <unk> and consisted of a control tower , a passenger terminal , a hangar for Førdefly and a wharf used by the seaplanes . The airport was owned by Førde Municipality . It consisted of a single 790 @-@ by @-@ 30 @-@ meter ( 2 @,@ 592 by 98 ft ) asphalt runway aligned 14 – 32 and with a 85 @-@ meter ( 279 ft ) <unk> on each end . The runway length was limited by the fjord to the north and by National Road 5 to the south . From the northern end of the runway , a taxiway ran due south about 400 meters ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) to the terminal . 
 The airport had very poor operating conditions . Whenever an aircraft was to land , the cranes at the shipyard had to be moved to allow sufficient clearance . Conversely , the airport could not be used when ships were launched . The industrial buildings were located just next to the taxiway . The control tower was located such that it did not have visual sight of the entire runway . The surrounding terrain , consisting of deep fjords , mountains and a town , made it impossible to install an instrument landing system . This again meant that the airport could only be served during daylight . The airport never received a permanent operating license .

 Øyrane was served by Widerøe , which held the permission to operate all subsidized routes on the regional network . Widerøe served the airport with its fleet of 19 @-@ passenger de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 6 Twin Otter aircraft and provided flights to Bergen Airport , Flesland in multi @-@ legged flights which included other towns in Sogn og Fjordane . Airlift and Førdefly were also based at the airport for periods , although neither operated any scheduled services . 
 = Me Against the World = 
 Me Against the World is the third studio album by American hip hop artist 2Pac . It was released March 14 , 1995 on the Interscope Records label . It was his impending prison sentence , troubles with the police and Shakur being poor , which many believe might have contributed to Shakur 's artistic reemergence on record , as his material is believed by Steve Huey of AllMusic to have become markedly more " confessional " , " reflective " , and " soul @-@ baring " . 
 Me Against the World , released while Shakur was imprisoned , made an immediate impact on the charts , debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 . This made Shakur the first artist to have an album debut at number one on Billboard 200 while serving time in prison . The album served as one of Shakur 's most positively reviewed albums , with many calling it the magnum opus of his career , and is considered one of the greatest and most influential hip hop albums of all @-@ time . Me Against the World won best rap album at the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards .

 In 1993 , Tupac Shakur was already a success in the hip hop industry , with two gold @-@ certified singles that reached the top twenty on the pop charts ( " I Get Around " , " Keep Ya Head Up " ) , and a platinum @-@ selling sophomore album that would peak just inside the top twenty @-@ five of the Billboard 200 ( Strictly 4 My <unk> ) . However , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old artist had a series of incidents and charges of breaking the law . In the summer of 1993 , Shakur was charged for assaulting director Allen Hughes while filming Menace II Society ; Shakur was later sentenced to fifteen days in jail . Later , in October 1993 , Shakur was charged with shooting two off @-@ duty police officers in Atlanta , though the charges would eventually be dismissed . In November , Shakur and two members of his entourage were charged with sexually assaulting a female fan , for which , 2Pac was the main person who was found guilty of sexual assault charges , including sodomy , in which he was sentenced to 1 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 5 years in Clinton Correctional Facility and Rikers ' Island , a maximum state penitentiary . According to Shakur , the album was made to show the hip hop audience his respect for the art form . Lyrically , Shakur intentionally tried to make the album more personal and reflective than his previous efforts . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 The musical production on the album was considered by several music critics to be the best on any of Shakur 's albums up to that point in his career . Steve " Flash " Juon at RapReviews gave the production on the album a perfect 10 of 10 rating , particularly praising tracks like " So Many Tears " and " Temptations " . Jon Pareles of the New York Times remarked that the production had a " fatalistic calm , in a commercial mold " . He compared the album 's production and synthesized hooks to that of Dr. Dre 's G @-@ funk style , stating that " while 2Pac doesn 't sing , other voices do , providing smooth melody " . James Bernard at Entertainment Weekly was not quite as enthusiastic about the album 's production , remarking that Shakur 's " vocals are buried deep in the mix . That 's a shame — if they were more in @-@ your @-@ face , the lackluster beats might be less noticeable . " The album 's recording sessions took place at ten different studios , while it was mastered at Bernie Grundman Mastering . Although the album was originally released on Interscope . Amaru Entertainment , the label owned by Shakur 's mother Afeni Shakur , has since released the album twice . 
 = = Lyrical Themes = = 
 It was like a blues record . It was down @-@ home . It was all my fears , all the things I just couldn 't sleep about . Everybody thought I was living so well and doing so good that I wanted to explain it . And it took a whole album to get it all out . I get to tell my innermost , darkest secrets I tell my own personal problems . 
 Some of the album 's main themes concern the loss of innocence , paranoia , and occasional self @-@ loathing . Much attention is paid to subjects such as the pain of urban survival . Not all of the music deals with such extremely bleak subject matter , however . Some tracks , such as " Old School " , lean more to the nostalgic , though somewhat bittersweet side in Shakur 's remembrance of his youth and the early days of hip hop music . The album is also well known for the more sensitive tracks " Dear Mama " and " Can U Get Away " , which are both directed towards and reveal Shakur 's devotion to the women he loves . On " Dear Mama " , Shakur pays tribute to and expresses his undying affection for his own mother , continuously reminding her that though his actions might sometimes seem to state otherwise , " you are appreciated " . On the track " Can U Get Away " , Shakur attempts to impress a woman who has managed to gain his affections , away from the woman 's abusive relationship . Four of the most eerie and revered tracks on the album are " If I Die 2Nite " , " Lord Knows " " Outlaw " which directly references the shooting that Tupac went through before it happened , and " Fuck The World " . Throughout the entirety of the album Shakur employs various poetical deliveries , ranging from alliteration ( " If I Die 2Nite " ) , to the use of paired couplets ( " Lord Knows " ) . 
 = = Singles = = 
 " Dear Mama " was released as the album 's first single in February 1995 , along with the track " Old School " as the B @-@ side . " Dear Mama " would be the album 's most successful single , topping the Hot Rap Singles chart , and peaking at the ninth spot on the Billboard Hot 100 . The single was certified platinum in July 1995 , and later placed at number 51 on the year @-@ end charts . 
 The second single , " So Many Tears " , was released in June , four months after the first single . The single would reach the number six spot on the Hot Rap Singles chart , and the 44th on the Billboard Hot 100 . 
 " Temptations " , released in August , was the third and final single from the album . The single would be the least successful of the three released , but still did fairly well on the charts , reaching number 68 on the Billboard Hot 100 , 35 on the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Singles & Tracks , and 13 on the Hot Rap Singles charts .

 In a contemporary review , Cheo H. Coker at Rolling Stone called the album Shakur 's best and said it was " by and large a work of pain , anger and burning desperation — [ it ] is the first time 2Pac has taken the conflicting forces tugging at his psyche head @-@ on " . Jon Pareles , writing in The New York Times , called Shakur the " St. Augustine of gangster rap " due to his ambivalence towards the behavior and nature of the gangster lifestyle . In a negative review , Robert Christgau of The Village Voice felt that Shakur is " witless " when dealing with fundamental hip hop themes of persecution and accused him of " self @-@ pity " : " The subtext of his persecution complex is his self @-@ regard " . " This may be the first hip @-@ hop blues LP , " observed Matt Hall in Select . " Not so much in the music , although the harp blasts owe more to Howlin ' Wolf than Tupac 's previous two solo efforts , but more with Shakur 's vocals , which are at once rebellious and resigned . . . . Me Against the World is a statement of intent , a note from the depths of America , and a fine , thoughtful LP . " 
 <unk> Abdul @-@ Adil of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times stated that " 2Pac 's latest also mixes toughness and tenderness . Desperation follows raw anger on " Fuck the World " and " It Ain 't Easy , " but most tracks confess frailties beneath the rapper 's tough exterior . " Dear Mama " is a tear @-@ jerking tribute to his mother ' " Lord Knows " discloses desperate considerations of suicide , and " So Many Tears " ponders a merciless world that wrecks young lives . 2Pac even includes a sorrowful " shout @-@ out " to Robert <unk> , the Chicago teenager whose brief life ended in a brutal shooting . After earlier releases that lacked focus and consistency , 2Pac finally presents a polished project of self @-@ examination and social commentary . It 's ironic that it arrives as his sentence begins . "

 In a retrospective review , AllMusic editor Steve Huey dubbed the album " [ Shakur 's ] most thematically consistent , least self @-@ contradicting work " , and stated , " it may not be his definitive album , but it just might be his best " . Steve " Flash " Juon of <unk> seemed to feel differently , remarking that the album " is not only the quintessential Shakur album , but one of the most important rap albums released in the 1990s as a whole " . Rap / Hip @-@ Hop Expert Henry Adaso from <unk> named it the 2nd best rap album from 1995 and then stating " Me Against The World was 2Pac at his very best : no excessive thug <unk> , no name @-@ inscribed lyrical missiles aimed at New York rivals . In fact , he stops to pay homage to rap pioneers on " Old School , " irrespective of region . " 
 On MTV 's Greatest Rappers of All Time list , Me Against the World was listed as one of 2Pac 's " certified classic " albums , along with <unk> Now , All Eyez On Me and The Don Killuminati : The 7 Day Theory . " One of the best five rap albums ever , " remarked Mojo , after Shakur 's death .

 = Benjamin Morrell = 
 Benjamin Morrell ( July 5 , 1795 – 1838 or 1839 ? ) was an American sea captain , explorer and trader who made a number of voyages , mainly to the Atlantic , the Southern Ocean and the Pacific Islands . In a ghost @-@ written memoir , A Narrative of Four Voyages , which describes his sea @-@ going life between 1823 and 1832 , Morrell included numerous claims of discovery and achievement , many of which have been disputed by geographers and historians , and in some cases have been proved false . He ended his career as a fugitive , having wrecked his ship and misappropriated parts of the salvaged cargo . 
 Morrell had an eventful early career , running away to sea at the age of 17 and being twice captured and imprisoned by the British during the War of 1812 . He subsequently sailed before the mast for several years before being appointed as chief mate , and later as captain , of the New York sealer Wasp . In 1823 he took Wasp for an extended voyage into subantarctic waters , and on his return made unsubstantiated claims to have travelled beyond 70 ° S and to have sighted new coastlines in the area now known as the Weddell Sea . His subsequent voyages mainly centered on the Pacific , where he attempted to develop trading relations with the indigenous populations . Although Morrell wrote of the enormous potential wealth to be obtained from the Pacific trade , his endeavours were , in the main , commercially unprofitable . 
 Despite his reputation among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy , Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who , while questioning his general reliability , maintain that not all his life was fraud and exaggeration . They believe that aside from the bombast and boastful tone of the account that carries his name , there is evidence that he carried out useful work , such his discovery of large @-@ scale guano deposits which led to the development of a full @-@ scale industry . He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839 , in Mozambique ; there is , however , evidence to suggest that this death might have been staged , and that he lived on in exile , possibly in South America . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Morrell was born at Rye , in Westchester County , New York , on July 5 , 1795 . He grew up in Stonington , Connecticut , where his father , also named Benjamin , was employed as a shipbuilder . Morrell , after minimal schooling , ran away to sea at the age of 17 " without taking leave of any member of my family , or intimating my purpose to a single soul " . During the War of 1812 , which broke out while he was at sea , he was twice captured by the British ; on his first voyage his ship , carrying a cargo of flour , was intercepted off St John 's , Newfoundland , and Morrell was detained for eight months . His second voyage landed him in Dartmoor prison , England , for two years . After his release Morrell continued his seafaring career , sailing before the mast as an ordinary seaman since his lack of education prevented him advancing to officer rank . A sympathetic captain , Josiah Macy , taught him what he needed to know to qualify as an officer , and in 1821 he was appointed chief mate on the sealer Wasp , under Captain Robert Johnson . 
 Wasp was bound for the South Shetland Islands , which had been discovered three years earlier by the British Captain William Smith . Morrell , who had evidently heard stories of these islands , was keen to go there . On the ensuing voyage he was involved in a series of " remarkable adventures " which included a narrow escape from drowning , then being lost at sea in a small boat during a gale that swept him 50 nautical miles ( 58 mi ; 93 km ) from the ship , and leading efforts to extricate Wasp when she became trapped in the ice . On the day following his return to New York , Morrell was appointed captain of Wasp , while Johnson took over the schooner Henry . The two ships were jointly commissioned to return to the South Seas for sealing , trading and exploration , and " to ascertain the practicality , under favourable circumstances , of penetrating to the South Pole . "

 Wasp and Henry sailed from New York on June 21 , 1822 , and remained together as far as the Falkland Islands . They then separated , Wasp travelling east in search of sealing grounds . Morrell 's account of the next few months of the voyage , in Antarctic and subantarctic waters , is controversial . His claims of distances , latitudes and discoveries have been challenged as inaccurate or impossible , giving substance to his reputation among his contemporaries for untruth , and leading to much criticism by later writers . 
 = = = = Antarctic waters = = = = 
 Morrell 's journal indicates that Wasp reached South Georgia on November 20 , and then sailed eastwards towards the isolated Bouvet Island , which lies approximately midway between Southern Africa and the Antarctic continent and is known as the world 's remotest island . It had been discovered in 1739 by the French navigator Jean @-@ Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier , but his plotting of its position was inaccurate ; Captain James Cook , in 1772 , had been unable to find it and had assumed its nonexistence . It had not been seen again until 1808 , when the British sealing captains James Lindsay and Thomas Hopper reached it and recorded its correct position , though they were unable to land . Morrell , by his own account , found the island without difficulty — with " improbable ease " , in the words of historian William Mills — before landing and hunting seals there . In his subsequent lengthy description , Morrell does not mention the island 's most obvious physical feature , its permanent ice cover . This has caused some commentators to doubt whether he actually visited the island . 
 After leaving Bouvet Island Wasp continued eastward , reaching the Kerguelen Islands on December 31 , 1822 , where she remained for 11 days . The voyage then evidently continued to the south and east until February 1 , 1823 , when Morrell records his position as 65 ° 52'S , 118 ° <unk> . Here , Morrell says he took advantage of an eleven @-@ knot breeze and turned the ship , to begin a passage westward . Apart from one undated position at 69 ° 11'S , 48 ° <unk> , Morrell 's journal is silent until February 23 , when he records crossing the Greenwich ( 0 ° ) meridian . Historians have doubted whether such a long passage from 118 ° E , about 3 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 000 mi ; 6 @,@ 500 km ) , could have been made so quickly in ice @-@ strewn waters and against the prevailing winds . Although some writers , including former Royal Navy navigator Rupert Gould , have argued that Morrell 's claims as to speed and distance are plausible , Morrell 's undated interim latitude was later shown to be well inside the Antarctic mainland territory of Enderby Land . Gould , writing in 1928 before the continental boundaries of this sector of Antarctica were known , based his support for Morrell on the premise that Enderby Land was an island with a sea channel south of it . He added : " If at some future date Enderby Land is found to form part of the Antarctic continent , Morrell 's most inveterate champions will , perforce , have to throw up the sponge . " 
 According to Morrell , Wasp reached the South Sandwich Islands on February 28 . His presence there is corroborated by his descriptions of the harbour on Thule Island , confirmed by the early 20th century expeditions . In the next phase of the voyage Morrell records that he took Wasp southwards and , the sea being remarkably clear of ice , reached a latitude of 70 ° 14'S before turning north on March 14 as fuel for the ship 's stoves was running out . This journey , if Morrell 's account is true , made him the first American sea @-@ captain to penetrate the Antarctic Circle . He believed , he says , that but for this deficiency he could have " made a glorious advance directly to the South Pole , or to 85 ° without the least doubt " . Some credence to his claimed southern latitude is provided by James Weddell 's voyage on a similar track , a month earlier , which reached 74 ° 15'S before retreating . The words used by Weddell to express his belief that the South Pole lay in open water are replicated by Morrell , whose account was written nine years after the event . Thus it is suggested by geographer Paul Simpson @-@ Housley that Morrell may have plagiarised Weddell 's experiences , since Weddell 's account had been published in 1827 . 
 = = = = New South Greenland = = = = 
 Morrell 's account describes how on the day after turning north from his southernmost point , a large tract of land was sighted in the region of 67 ° <unk> , 44 ° <unk> . Morrell refers to this land as " New South Greenland " , and records that during the next few days Wasp explored more than 300 nautical miles ( 350 mi ; 560 km ) of coast . Morrell provided vivid descriptions of the land 's features , with observations of its abundant wildlife . No such land exists ; other appearances of land at or near this bearing , reported during the 1842 expedition of Sir James Clark Ross , have likewise proved imaginary . In 1917 the Scottish explorer William Speirs Bruce wrote that the existence of land in this area " should not be rejected until absolutely disproved . " By this time both Wilhelm Filchner and Ernest Shackleton , in their respective ice @-@ bound ships , had drifted close to the plotted positions of New South Greenland and reported no sign of it . It has been suggested that what Morrell saw was actually the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula , some 400 nautical miles ( 460 mi ; 740 km ) further west from his sighting . This would require a navigational error of at least 10 ° , and a complete revision of Morrell 's timeline after leaving the South Sandwich Islands . Assuming that Morrell did not invent the experience , a possible explanation is that he witnessed a superior mirage . 
 = = = = Pacific and home = = = = 
 On March 19 Morrell " bade farewell to the cheerless shores of New South Greenland " , and sailed away from the Antarctic never to return . The remaining stages of the voyage are uncontroversial , involving a year @-@ long cruise in the Pacific Ocean . This took Wasp to the Galápagos Islands and also to the island of Más a Tierra where , a century earlier , the Scottish seaman Alexander Selkirk had been marooned , providing the inspiration for the Robinson Crusoe story . Wasp returned to New York in May 1824 . There , he found that his wife whom he had married in 1819 , not named in any accounts of Morrell 's life or career , and his two small children , likewise unnamed , had all died . He quickly married his 15 @-@ year @-@ old cousin , Abigail Jane Wood ( " Abby " ) . 
 = = = Second voyage : North and South Pacific = = = 
 For his second voyage Morrell took charge of a new ship , Tartar , which sailed from New York on July 19 , 1824 for the Pacific Ocean . In the next two years Tartar first explored the American coastline from the Straits of Magellan to Cape Blanco ( now in Oregon ) . He then sailed westward to the islands of Hawaii , known at that time as the Sandwich Islands , where Captain James Cook had met his death nearly 40 years earlier . Thereafter Tartar returned to the American coast and tracked slowly southwards back to the Straits of Magellan . 
 Among the events witnessed and recorded in Morrell 's journal were the siege of Callao , the main port of Peru , by Simón Bolívar 's liberators , and a spectacular volcanic eruption on Fernandina Island in the Galápagos archipelago , which Tartar visited during February 1825 . Fernandina , then known as Narborough Island , exploded on February 14 . In Morrell 's words " The heavens appeared to be one blaze of fire , intermingling with millions of falling stars and meteors ; while the flames shot upward from the peak of Narborough to the height of at least two thousand feet . " Morrell reports that the air temperature reached 123 ° F ( 51 ° C ) , and as Tartar approached the river of lava flowing into the sea , the water temperature rose to 150 ° F ( 66 ° C ) . Some of the crew collapsed in the heat . 
 Morrell also records how a hunting trip ashore in California led to a skirmish with the locals which turned into a full @-@ scale battle ending , he says , with seventeen natives dead and seven of Tartar 's men wounded . Morrell claims that he was among the casualties , with an arrow in his thigh . Of a visit to San Francisco Morrell writes : " The inhabitants are principally Mexicans and Spaniards who are very indolent and consequently very filthy . " After revisiting the Galapagos Islands and gathering a harvest of fur seal and terrapin , Tartar began a slow journey home on October 13 , 1825 . As they left the Pacific Morrell claimed to have personally inspected and identified every danger existing along the American Pacific coast . Tartar finally reached New York Harbour on May 8 , 1826 with a main cargo of 6 @,@ 000 fur seals . This haul did not please Morrell 's employers , who had evidently expected rather more . " The reception I met from my owners was cold and repulsive " , he wrote . " The Tartar did not return home laden with silver and gold , and therefore my toils and dangers counted for nothing " . 
 = = = Third voyage : West African coast = = = 
 In 1828 Morrell was engaged by Messrs. Christian Bergh & Co. to take command of the schooner Antarctic ( named , he claims , in honour of his earlier Antarctic achievements ) . Antarctic left New York on June 25 , 1828 , bound for Western Africa . During the following months Morrell carried out an extensive survey of the African coast between the Cape of Good Hope and Benguela , and led several short excursions inland . He was impressed by the commercial potential of this coast , recording that " many kinds of skins may be procured about here , including those of the leopard , fox , bullock , together with ostrich feathers and valuable minerals " . At <unk> Island he discovered huge deposits of guano , 25 feet thick . In the face of such opportunity he records his belief that a $ 30 @,@ 000 investment would produce in two years a profit " from ten to fifteen hundred per cent . " 
 During the voyage Morrell experienced several encounters with the slave trade , first at the Cape Verde Islands , then a centre for the trade because of its geographical position in relation to the Americas , Europe and Africa . He found the slaves ' conditions wretched , but was impressed by their passion for music which , he thought , " can alleviate even the pangs caused by the galling fetters of slavery " . Later in the voyage he witnessed what he describes as " horrid barbarity " , including the spectacle of two women slaves in their death agonies as a result of floggings . A lengthy soliloquy in his journal on the evils of slavery concludes : " [ T ] he root , the source , the foundation of the evil is the ignorance and superstition of the poor negroes themselves " . On June 8 , 1829 , Morrell wrote in his journal : " The voyage had been prosperous beyond our expectations , and any further stay on the African coast would have been a waste of time and money " . He arrived in New York on July 14 . 
 = = = Fourth voyage : South Seas and Pacific Ocean = = = 
 According to Morrell , Antarctic 's owners were unanimous that he should make another voyage with the ship , and in September 1829 Antarctic left New York , bound for the South Atlantic and Pacific in search of seals . At her own insistence , and against Morrell 's and the owners ' advice , his wife Abby accompanied him . By January 1830 Antarctic had reached the Auckland Islands , south of New Zealand , where Morrell had hoped for a rich harvest of seal , but found the waters empty . He sailed north for Manila in the Philippines , hoping to find a commercial cargo there , and arrived in March 1830 . No such cargo was available , but Morrell was persuaded by the American consul , George Hubbell , that a potentially profitable enterprise would be to collect sea cucumbers ( otherwise known as " Bêche @-@ du @-@ mer " ) , plentifully available in the islands now known as Micronesia . These could then be taken to China where they were much prized . 
 Hubbell would not permit Antarctic to sail with Abby on board ; possibly he had designs on her . Morrell sailed from Manila without her , and initially had little luck in finding sea cucumbers in any quantity . Eventually Antarctic reached the Carteret Islands , a small atoll which now forms part of Papua New Guinea , and found sea cucumbers in abundance . Morrell set up camp on one of the islands , where he faced a hostile reception from the population , who were nevertheless intrigued by their first sight of metal . There were thefts of tools ; Morrell responded by holding several chiefs as hostages , at which the islanders mounted a full @-@ scale attack on Morrell 's shore base . Fourteen crew members were killed ; <unk> was forced to make a hasty withdrawal , leaving much equipment behind . 
 Morrell retreated to Manila , planning retaliation . He hired a large number of <unk> to augment his crew , and with a help of a loan from the British consul , adapted Antarctica and fitted her with guns and cannons . The ship , with Abby now on board , returned to the Carteret Islands and attacked with gunfire . After a series of such assaults and heavy casualties , the population sued for peace . This enabled Morrell to occupy one of the islands in exchange for cutlery , trinkets , tools and other metal artefacts . The peace was temporary ; Morrell 's shore camp was continually harassed by the population . Finally , Morrell decided to abandon the enterprise , citing the " <unk> vindictiveness and incessant hostilities " of the native population . 
 On November 13 , 1830 , while returning to Manila , Antarctica anchored off the coast of the island of <unk> ( in today 's West New Britain Province ) . A flotilla of native canoes approached the ship , full of apparently well @-@ armed and aggressive islanders . After his experiences at Carteret Island , Morrell took no chances and ordered his crew to fire . The small craft were shattered ; many died , while others manage to regain the shore . One man , who had clung to Antarctic 's rudder , was hauled on board as a prisoner . The crew named him " Sunday " — his actual name was Dako . An account of this engagement was entered into the ship 's log by John Keeler , the ship 's young navigator . Just over a week later , on November 22 , a skirmish in the <unk> Islands brought Morrell another captive , whom the crew named " Monday " ( his true name was never discovered ) . With two native prisoners , but little else to show from this venture , Antarctic returned to Manila in mid @-@ December . 
 By now desperate for some profitable activity , Morrell made some money by displaying Dako and Monday to a fascinated public . The only maritime opportunity available was to take a cargo to Cádiz , which he was obliged to accept . He left Manila on January 13 , 1831 , taking his captives with him . When Antarctic reached Cádiz five months later the port was under quarantine and closed . He was forced to discharge the cargo in Bordeaux , where Dako and Monday , rumored in the town to be cannibals , again attracted great curiosity . Antarctic finally reached New York on August 27 , 1831 ; despite his lack of commercial success , Morrell remained upbeat about future prospects in the Pacific . " I could , with only a modest share of patronage ... open a new avenue of trade more lucrative than any that our country has ever yet enjoyed , and further , it would be in my power , and mine alone , to secure the monopoly for any term I pleased . " In the final paragraph of his account of the Morrell records that his wife 's father , her aunt and her aunt 's child had all died during his absence , as had one of Morrell 's cousins and her husband .

 When he returned to New York after his profitless fourth voyage , Morrell was heavily in debt and in urgent need of funds . Newspapers showed great interest in the story of the voyage , and Morrell was keen to cash in . Within a few days of his arrival he had organised a stage show , entitled " Two Cannibals of the Islands of the South Pacific " . This spectacle , embellished with accounts of the massacre at Carteret Island and other dramatic inclusions , played to large crowds at New York 's Rubens Peale museum . In October 1831 Morrell took the show on a tour , which began in Albany on October 10 . Among those who visited the show was the 12 @-@ year @-@ old Herman Melville , the future author of Moby @-@ Dick , who may have based the character of Queequeg on his memory of Dako . The tour proceeded to Philadelphia , Baltimore and finally Washington DC , before ending in January 1832 , at which point Morrell returned the show to Peale 's . 
 Morrell 's second projected source of funds was his account of his voyages , which the firm of J. and J. Harper were willing to publish . They engaged an experienced writer and dramatist , Samuel Woodworth , to make sense of Morrell 's notes and sea journals , although Woodworth 's role as ghost writer was not made public . Abby Morrell 's journals received similar treatment from another established author , Samuel Knapp . His book was published in December 1832 , hers early in 1833 . Morrell 's was very successful and sold well ; the New York Mirror found it " a highly interesting and instructive work " , with " stirring adventures and much geographical and nautical information " . France 's leading explorer Jules Dumont d 'Urville was complimentary , acknowledging Morrell as " courageous , skilled and dedicated " ; the explorer and journalist Jeremiah Reynolds , on the other hand , observed that the account contained more poetry than truth . Abby 's book attracted less attention . It purported to be written to promote " the amelioration of the condition of the American seaman " , a subject in which she had not otherwise evinced interest . Woodworth exploited the public 's curiosity by preparing a stage play , The Cannibals , which opened at the Bowery Theatre , New York , in March 1833 and had a lengthy and successful run . Morrell 's ghosted account was one of the sources used by Edgar Allan Poe in his novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym . 
 = = = Return to the Pacific = = = 
 With the restoration of his fortunes and his new @-@ found fame , Morrell began plans for a further Pacific voyage , intending to return Dako and Monday to their islands and exploit further trading opportunities . Having lobbied unsuccessfully for Congressional funding , Morrell eventually found backers who secured a converted brigantine , Margaret Oakley , in which he set sail from New York on March 9 , 1834 . Among the crew was Samuel Woodworth 's 18 @-@ year @-@ old son Selim Woodworth , whose journals and letters provided a record of the voyage . Monday was not with them ; he had died a year previously . 
 Margaret Oakley took the westerly route to the Pacific , across the Atlantic to the Cape Verde Islands , then south to the Cape of Good Hope and across the Indian Ocean , arriving in the vicinity of Dako 's home islands in November 1834 . Dako was received rapturously by his people , as one who had returned from the dead . Morrell remained in the area for several months , exploring and collecting artefacts , before departing in April 1835 for Port Jackson ( Sydney Harbour ) in Australia for repairs and repainting . By June , Morrell was back among the Pacific islands , where he took his final leave of Dako . After a fruitless interval prospecting for gold on the New Guinea mainland , Morrell took the ship to Canton in China , where he found a valuable cargo for New York on which he anticipated a profit of $ 100 @,@ 000 . 
 After leaving Canton on November 14 , Margaret Oakley was delayed in Singapore by bad weather , where some of the cargo was sold to pay for repairs . The ship left Singapore on December 31 , 1835 , and was seen off Mauritius in early February 1836 , but then disappeared . She was given up for lost with all her crew before , months later , news arrived in Mauritius that she had been wrecked on the coast of Madagascar . The crew was rescued , although much of the ship 's cargo was lost in the wreck , and more was used to pay off the rescuers and other of Morrell 's debts . When representatives of the insurers arrived in Madagascar to assess the loss , they discovered that Morrell had departed , taking part of the remaining cargo with him . He found his way to South Africa , where he boarded a British ship , Rio Packet , bound for London . Outside US jurisdiction , he was beyond the reach of the American authorities , who equated his actions with piracy . 
 = = = Final years and death = = = 
 In London early in 1837 , Morrell attempted to convert some of the purloined cargo into cash , but word of his activities had spread , and the proceeds were immediately confiscated by agents acting for Margaret Oakley 's insurers . His reputation as a probable fraud prevented him from finding new employment ; he sought work with the shipping firm of Enderby Brothers , but Charles Enderby said that " he had heard so much of [ Morrell ] that he did not think fit to enter into any engagement with him . " Thwarted in London , Morrell turned his attention to France . He had heard that d 'Urville was organising an expedition to the Antarctic , and on June 20 , 1837 , wrote to the French Geographical Society in Paris to offer his services : " I will engage to place the Proud Banner of France ten degrees nearer the Pole than any other Banner has ever been planted , providing I can obtain the command of a Small schooner ... properly manned and equipped " . His offer was declined ; Morrell was by now regarded as a fraud in France as well as in Britain and America . 
 It is not known how Morrell supported himself during his months in London ; it is possible that Abby sent him funds from America . Somehow , in the autumn of 1837 he made his way to Havana in Cuba , after which his movements are unclear . It appears that he eventually obtained command of a vessel , possibly the Christine , and that he sailed in September 1838 , probably planning a return to the Pacific . He got no further than Mozambique on the East African coast ; his ship was wrecked , and Morrell was stranded ashore . He is reported to have died , either of fever or during an insurrection , in late 1838 or early 1839 . This story is complicated by an alternative account indicating that Christine was wrecked a year later , early in 1840 , although whether Morrell was alive and in command by that date is unrecorded . Christine was known as a slave ship , which raises the possibility that in his final years Morrell was engaged with the slave trade . Fairhead suggests an alternative hypothesis : that Morrell staged his death in Mozambique , to evade Margaret Oakley 's insurers . In this scenario he may have escaped to South America and lived out his days there . A letter dated August 11 , 1843 , to the editor of The New York Commercial Advertiser and signed " Morrell " could , Fairhead maintains , only have been written by someone with intimate knowledge of the Oakley voyage . Fairhead offers no explanation why Morrell , if alive , should break his silence other than : " Perhaps , like many criminals , he could not resist flaunting himself " . 
 There is little documented history for Abby Morrell after 1838 : two records , respectively dated 1841 and 1850 , place her in New York , but details of her life and eventual death are unknown . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 Despite Morrell 's exposure as a fraud , following the Margaret Oakley debacle , his contemporaries did not uniformly denounce him . To some , he was " the biggest liar in the Pacific " , while d 'Urville , who had earlier warmly praised Morrell 's Four Voyages account , turned on the American and accused him of fabricating many of his supposed discoveries . However , Jeremiah Reynolds , who had expressed scepticism over the narrative , included Morrell 's Pacific discoveries in his report to Congress A Report in relation to islands , reefs , and shoals in the Pacific Ocean . This , says Simpson @-@ Housley , was surely a compliment to the otherwise disgraced navigator . 
 Later commentators and historians have tended to assess his career with a degree of sympathy . Hugh Robert Mill of the Royal Geographical Society , writing in 1905 , considered that a man may be ignorant and boastful , yet still do solid work . Mill thought Morrell " intolerably vain , and as great a braggart as any hero of autobiographical romance " , but still found the narrative itself " most entertaining " . Rupert Gould , writing in 1928 , thought that Morrell may have been boastful and self @-@ aggrandizing , but that did not make him a deliberate liar . Gould points to the accurate information provided by Morrell on the discovery of the guano deposits on <unk> Island , which laid the foundations of a flourishing industry . 
 William Mills , a much more recent commentator , echoes the view that " something may be salvaged from Morrell 's account , although much of it must be discarded " . In regard to the Antarctic discoveries , which are Mills 's particular concern , he points out that these are given no special emphasis . Morrell does not seem to regard the Antarctic expedition as particularly remarkable , and the discovery of " New South Greenland " is not claimed by Morrell himself but is credited to Captain Johnson in 1821 . In the preface to his Four Voyages book , Morrell admits that he incorporated the experiences of others into his account . Paul Simpson @-@ Housley suggests that as well as adapting Weddell 's narrative as his own experience , Morrell may have taken the details of his 1823 visit to Bouvet Island from the records of an 1825 visit by Captain George Norris , 
 As a reminder of Morrell 's brief Antarctic exploits , Morrell Island , at 59 ° 27'S , 27 ° <unk> , is an alternative name for Thule Island in the Southern Thule sub @-@ group of the South Sandwich Islands . During his Pacific travels Morrell encountered groups of islands that were not on his charts , treated them as new discoveries and named them after various New York acquaintances – Westervelt , Bergh , Livingstone , <unk> . One was named " Young William Group " after Morrell 's infant son . None of these names appear in modern maps , although the " Livingstone Group " has been identified with <unk> Atoll , and " Bergh 's Group " with the Chuuk Islands .

 = Ring Line ( Oslo ) = 
 The Ring Line ( Norwegian : T @-@ <unk> or <unk> ) is the newest rapid transit line of the Oslo Metro of Oslo , Norway . It connects to the Sognsvann Line in the west and the Grorud Line in the east ; along with these two lines and the Common Tunnel , the Ring Line creates a loop serving both the city centre and Nordre Aker borough . The 5 @.@ 0 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) -long line has three stations : Nydalen , Storo and Sinsen . Four @-@ fifths of the line runs within two tunnels , with the 1 @.@ 0 @-@ kilometer ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) section between Storo and Sinsen , including both stations , being the only at @-@ grade part . The line connects to the Grorud Line north of Carl Berners plass and with the Sognsvann Line north of Ullevål stadion . 
 Planning for the line began in the late 1980s , and the city council approved the line 1997 . Construction started in 2000 ; Nydalen and Storo opened on 20 August 2003 , and Sinsen opened on 20 August 2006 . The line cost NOK 1 @,@ 348 million to build and was financed through Oslo Package 2 . The Ring Line is served by lines 4 , 5 and 6 of the metro , operated by Sporveien T @-@ banen on contract with the Ruter transport authority . All lines operate each fifteen minutes . Nydalen and Storo are such located that trains in either direction use the same time along the loop , effectively giving a five @-@ minute headway to the city centre . After the opening of the line , the areas around the stations have had increased urban redevelopment . The infrastructure is owned and maintained by the municipal company Sporveien . 
 = = History = = 
 By the 1960s , Oslo had a rapid transit network that branched out north @-@ east and north @-@ west from the city centre . In 1987 , the western and eastern network were connected , and through @-@ trains started operating between the two networks from 1993 . Plans to make a second connection through the borough of Nordre Aker were launched by politicians in the 1980s . It was argued that this was cheaper than building roads , with the per @-@ kilometre price being about a quarter of that for motorways . Some politicians also saw the Ring Line as an opportunity to close all parts of the Oslo Tramway , except the <unk> and Lilleaker Line . Oslo Sporveier , the contemporary operator of the metro , started planning the line during the late 1980s . The plans would take advantage of the Gjøvik Line 's right @-@ of @-@ way between Storo and Sinsen , while the section from Storo to Tåsen would have to be built in a tunnel . 
 A projection for the line was presented in 1991 by Oslo Sporveier , where daily ridership was estimated to be 54 @,@ 000 passengers . The plans included a possibility for the high @-@ speed Gardermoen Line , that would be built to Oslo Airport , Gardermoen , to have a stop at Storo . This was later discarded when it was instead chosen to be built via Lillestrøm . There were also ideas to run trains from the Hoved Line from Lillestrøm to Grefsen Station via the Alnabru – Grefsen Line , located adjacent to Storo , that would allow the central parts of Groruddalen to connect with the Ring Line and Nordre Aker . When the operating company ordered new T2000 trains for the Holmenkoll Line , the design allowed future versions to have dual current systems , to handle both the 750 volts on the metro network ( from a third rail and overhead wire ) , and the 15 kV 16 2 ⁄ 3 Hz AC system of the main railways . This would allow the Ring Line to share the physical track with the Gjøvik Line on the section from Storo to Sinsen . The new <unk> were seen as a preparation for the Ring Line , and were optimised for higher speeds than the old stock , being capable of operating at 100 kilometres per hour ( 62 mph ) . At the same time , the Sognsvann Line was being upgraded to full metro standard , like the eastern part of the metro had , and would lose the overhead wires and get longer platforms . 
 In 1992 , the tram division of Oslo Sporveier launched an alternative Ring Line that would have been built as a light rail , using in part the existing tramway . In the west , it would follow the Sinsen Line via Sinsen to Storo . A new line would have to be built from Storo to Tåsen . The line would then use the existing Sognsvann Line to Majorstuen , where it would connect to the tramway and follow the Frogner Line into the city , via a new Vika Line through Aker Brygge . This alternative would cost NOK 61 million to build , compared to NOK 470 million estimated for the rapid transit solution . Named the Light Rail Ring ( Norwegian : <unk> ) , it would have 38 stops instead of 16 stops , and a travel time of 34 minutes instead of 22 minutes . Annual operating costs for the light rail solution would be NOK 57 @.@ 5 million , compared to 43 @.@ 9 million for the rapid transit solution . 
 Between 1994 and 1998 , there was local political debate about how Rikshospitalet , that was moving to Gaustad , should be served by public transport . The state wanted to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway to the new hospital , while many local politicians wanted to use the rapid transit . Since the Ring Line would increase traffic on the <unk> Line , moving the line was considered to better serve the hospital . In 1998 , an agreement was reached whereby the light rail line would be built , and a new station for transfer from the metro would open at Forskningsparken . 
 A detailed proposal was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996 . It became clear that Berg would not be served by the Ring Line . Many neighbours to the route of the Sognsvann Line complained about this proposal , stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel . They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at @-@ grade in densely populated areas , while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen . To compensate , Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line . Also , the Norwegian Public Roads Administration protested to the plans , and stated that funding should be allocated to upgrading Ring 3 to six lanes before public transport investments were made in the area . 
 The city council voted in favour of building the Ring Line on 25 June 1997 , against the votes of the Progress Party . However , the decision did not include how the line would be financed , and the politicians stated that they were hoping that the state would use national road funds to finance the project . This was partially ensured in December , when a political agreement was reached for Oslo Package 2 , a financing plan for investments in public transport in Oslo and Akershus between 2002 and 2011 . 
 In December 1999 , a disagreement arose between the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the city ; the city would not except the government 's promise to finance part of the line . Both Minister of Transport and Communications , Dag Jostein <unk> from the Christian Democratic Party and Oslo City Commissioner of Transport and the Environment , <unk> <unk> @-@ Jensen from the Conservative Party , agreed upon the distribution of funding from the city and state , and both wanted construction to start as soon as possible . The city council did not accept the guarantees from the state until March 2000 . Construction started in June , with the Agency for Road and Transport of the municipality responsible for construction . The city would pay NOK 224 million , while the state would pay NOK 673 million . 
 The first section opened from Ullevål stadion via Nydalen to Storo on 20 August 2003 , costing NOK 590 million . With the opening , line 4 was extended from Ullevål stadion to Storo . Nydalen had grown up as an urban redevelopment area after the local industry had been abandoned in the 1980s , where 14 @,@ 800 jobs had been located by 2004 . On 20 August 2006 , the final section opened , from Storo via Sinsen to Carl Berners plass , with the whole project costing NOK 1 @,@ 348 million . 
 A report published by the city in 2007 declared the line a success and stated that all goals for the line had been exceeded . A survey conducted by the city in 2003 and 2007 showed that the Ring Line had a significant impact on the use of public transport in the area . Total public transport usage increased from 28 to 45 % ; use for commuting increased from 35 to 61 % . At the Norwegian School of Management ( BI ) , 85 % of the students used public transport . The Ring Line reduced the estimated number of daily car trips by 10 @,@ 000 , and generated 11 @,@ 000 more daily public transport trips . In 2007 , daily passenger numbers at the stations were <unk> for Nydalen , 3630 for Storo and 2300 at Sinsen . The line allowed travel time from the Nydalen and Storo to the city centre to be halved , and travel time from Nydalen to the city center is faster by metro than by taxi . 
 = = Route = = 
 The 5 @.@ 0 @-@ kilometer ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) Ring Line branches off from the Sognsvann Line after Ullevål stadion , just before Berg . It immediately enters a tunnel that runs via Nydalen to Storo . The station at Storo is just outside the entrance to the tunnel . From Storo to Sinsen , the tracks are laid parallel to the Gjøvik Line of the mainland railway . Also the Sinsen Line of the Oslo Tramway and the Ring 3 motorway follow the same corridor between the two stations . The section between Ullevål stadion and Storo is 3 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 1 mi ) , while the section from Storo to Carl Berners plass is 1 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 1 mi ) . Of these , 4 @.@ 0 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) are in tunnels . 
 The Nydalen district , formerly an industrial area , has since undergone urban redevelopment . The immediate vicinity of the station includes several large workplaces . In 2005 , BI , with 8000 students and faculty , moved into a new campus across the street from Nydalen Station . Nydalen is the only underground station on the Ring Line . The escalators leading down to the platform features The Tunnel of Light , an artistic presentation of sound and colour around the passengers as they ascend from or to descend to the station . The artwork contains 1800 lights and 44 speakers . Nydalen also serves as a bus hub . 
 Storo opened as a tram station as part of the Grünerløkka – Torshov Line on 28 November 1902 . It is located about 200 meters from Grefsen Station of the Gjøvik Line . The Norwegian National Rail Administration is planning to move the station platform so there can be direct transfer between NSB Gjøvikbanen 's commuter rail services , and the metro . Storo functions as a bus and tram hub ; it serves line 11 and 12 on the Grünerløkka – <unk> and Kjelsås Line , and line 13 on the Sinsen Line . 
 Sinsen opened on 20 August 2006 , three years after the two other stations . The station is located close to , but not adjacent , to the tram stop <unk> on the Sinsen Line ( tram no . 17 ) . Located at the interchange between Ring 3 and Trondheimsveien , it also serves as a bus hub . 
 The Løren Line is a proposed connection which would connect the Ring and Grorud Line . It would split from the Ring Line south of Sinsen , and run part in tunnel and part at @-@ grade until it connects to the Grorud Line west of <unk> . In the tunnel section the new station , Løren , would be built . The day section would run parallel to part of the mainline Alnabru – Grefsen Line . The line will allow metro trains to run directly from the Grorud Line to the Ring Line , and thus pass from east to west without passing through the packed Common Tunnel . It is part of the political compromise Oslo Package 3 , and estimated to be completed by 2017 . 
 = = Service = = 
 When operating a full circle route , trains start through the Common Tunnel . If running clockwise , they pass through all the common stations ( Tøyen , Grønland , Jernbanetorget , Stortinget , Nationaltheatret and Majorstuen ) . They head north on the Sognsvann Line , stopping at Blindern , Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion . The Ring Line proper then splits off , and the trains serve Nydalen , Storo and Sinsen , before Carl Berners plass on the Grorud Line . After that , the trains again enter the Common Tunnel at Tøyen . 
 Lines 3 , 4 and 6 operate on the Ring Line , each with a 15 @-@ minute headway . Line 3 and 6 operates on the west side of the line , with line 3 terminating at Storo and line 4 operating on the east side . Between Nydalen and Storo , lines 4 and 6 swap numbers . From the city centre , line 4 comes from the Lambertseter Line , line 3 from the Østensjø Line and line 6 from the Sognsvann Line . After line 4 and 6 have run through the loop , they continue though the city again before heading to the terminal destination . Travel time from Nydalen and Storo stations is about the same , independent of which direction on the Ring Line travellers choose . Passengers heading for the city centre can therefore take the first train that comes , independent of which direction it is heading , thus giving Nydalen and Storo a five @-@ minute headway service to the city centre . The trains are operated by Sporveien T @-@ banen , a subsidiary of Sporveien , on contract with the public transport authority Ruter . 
 Transfer to the Kolsås- , <unk> and Holmenkoll Line is available at Majorstuen ; transfer to the <unk> , <unk> and Furuset Line is available at Tøyen and transfer to the Grorud Line is available at Carl Berners plass . Transfer to Oslo Central Station , which serves all trains in Eastern Norway , is available at Jernbanetorget . Most west @-@ bound trains can also be reached at Nationaltheatret , and trains along the Gjøvik line can be reached at Grefsen Station , that is close , but not adjacent , to Storo . The Oslo Tramway can be reached from several stations . In the city centre , transfer to all lines is possible at Jernbanetorget ; all lines but no . 12 can also be reached at either Stortinget or Nationaltheatret . Lines 11 , 12 and 19 all terminate at Majorstuen ; lines 17 and 18 run via Forskningsparken ; lines 11 , 12 and 13 can be reached at Storo ; and line 17 runs past Carl Berners plass . 
 = Battle of Roatán = 
 The Battle of Roatán ( sometimes spelled " Rattan " ) was an American War of Independence battle fought on March 16 , 1782 , between British and Spanish forces for control of Roatán , an island off the Caribbean coast of present @-@ day Honduras . 
 A Spanish expeditionary force under Matías de Gálvez , the Captain General of Spanish Guatemala , gained control of the British @-@ held island after bombarding its main defences . The British garrison surrendered the next day . The Spanish evacuated the captured soldiers , 135 civilians and 300 slaves , and destroyed their settlement , which they claimed had been used as a base for piracy and privateering . 
 The assault was part of a larger plan by Gálvez to eliminate British influence in Central America . Although he met with temporary successes , the British were able to maintain a colonial presence in the area . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the entry of Spain into the American War of Independence in 1779 , both Spain and Great Britain contested territories in Central America . Although most of the territory was part of the Spanish Captaincy General of Guatemala , the British had established logging rights on the southern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula ( present @-@ day Belize ) , and had established informal settlements ( lacking formal colonial authority ) on the Mosquito Coast of present @-@ day Honduras and Nicaragua . Guatemalan Governor Matías de Gálvez had moved quickly when the declaration of war arrived , seizing St. George 's Caye , one of the principal British island settlements off the Yucatan coast . Many of the British fled that occupation to the island of Roatán , another British @-@ controlled island about 40 miles ( 64 km ) off the Honduran coast . British commander Edward Marcus Despard used Roatán as a base for guerilla @-@ style operations to extend and maintain British influence on the Mosquito Coast , and for privateering operations against Spanish shipping . ( Sources do not indicate whether Despard was present on Roatán at the time of the Spanish attack ; if he was , he was probably not captured , since he continued to be active in the area . Stephens suggests that he was on Jamaica at the time . ) 
 Gálvez , who had been ordered by King Charles to " dislocate the English from their hidden settlements on the Gulf of Honduras " , began planning offensive operations against the British mainland settlements as early as 1780 , after the British abandoned their failed expedition into Nicaragua . He raised as many as 15 @,@ 000 militia , and received financial and logistical support from many parts of the Spanish colonial empire in the Americas . For logistical and diplomatic reasons , no operations were launched until after the American victory at Yorktown in October 1781 . The British loss opened the possibility that the British would be able to deploy troops to Central America to better defend the area . Gálvez ' plans called for assaults on the British presence in the Bay Islands ( principally Roatán ) , followed by a sweep along the coast to eliminate the British from the mainland . Troops from central Guatemala were staged in early 1782 at Trujillo for the assault on Roatán , while additional forces moved overland from Nicaragua , Honduras , and Salvador toward the principal British settlement of Black River . 
 Gálvez arrived at Trujillo on March 8 to organise the assault on Roatán . Leaving a force of 600 at Trujillo to further harass the British and their partisan allies , he embarked another 600 troops onto transports , and sailed for Roatán on March 12 , escorted by three frigates ( Santa Matilde , the Santa Cecilia , and the Antiope ) and a number of smaller armed naval vessels , under the command of Commodore Enrique Macdonell . 
 The British residents of Roatán were aware of the ongoing Spanish military activities . The main settlement , New Port Royal , was defended by Forts Dalling and Despard , which mounted 20 guns . The island 's white non @-@ slave population was however quite small . In 1781 they appealed to the British commander at Bluefields for support , but he was only able to send additional weapons , which did not add significantly to the island 's defenses . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The Spanish fleet arrived off Roatán early on March 13 , and , after its defenders fired several ineffectual cannon shots , anchored out of range while Gálvez sent a party in to request the surrender of the island 's defenders . The defenders asked for six hours to consider their options , which Gálvez granted . After that time had elapsed , the defenders indicated that they were prepared to stand their ground , and refused to surrender . Immediate attack was not possible due to high winds and rough seas , so Gálvez then held council , and a plan of attack was formulated . 
 At about 10 : 15 am on March 16 , Spanish guns opened up against Forts Dalling and Despard , which guarded the mouth of New Port Royal 's harbour . By 1 : 00 pm the British guns there had been silenced , and Major General Gabriel <unk> began landing troops . After the two forts were secured , the Spanish warships entered the harbour and began raking the town with cannon fire , while British artillery fired back from positions in the hills above the town . This exchange continued until sunset , at which point the British defenders capitulated . The Spanish had two killed and four wounded in the battle , while only two slaves were wounded on the other side .

 Terms of surrender were agreed the next day . Gálvez and his men remained on the island for several days , collecting weapons , rounding up slaves that had run away , destroying all the buildings and agriculture on the island , as well as burning many of the ships in the harbour , which they assumed to be used in smuggling and other illicit trade . The Spanish left the island on March 23 , carrying as prisoners of war 81 British soldiers , 300 slaves , and 135 British civilians . The prisoners were sent to Havana , where the slaves were auctioned off and the others held until they could be exchanged . 
 Gálvez was able to only temporarily partially eliminate British influences in the area . He followed up his success at Roatán with the capture of Black River in early April , but any attempt to advance further bogged down . James Lawrie , the commander at Black River , and Edward Marcus Despard successfully recaptured Black River , and were able to hold it until the end of the war .

 In 1975 Spain , a young girl named Laura is given up for adoption . Years later , adult Laura ( Rueda ) returns to the closed orphanage , accompanied by her husband , Carlos ( Cayo ) , and their seven @-@ year @-@ old adopted son , Simón ( Príncep ) . She plans to reopen the orphanage as a facility for disabled children . Simón claims to see a boy named Tomás ( Óscar Casas ) . He befriends Tomás and draws pictures of him as a child wearing a sack mask . Social worker Benigna Escobedo ( Montserrat <unk> ) informs Laura that Simón 's adoption file indicates that Simón is HIV positive . Incensed at Benigna 's intrusion , Laura asks her to leave . She later finds Benigna in the orphanage 's coal shed , but Benigna flees the scene . Later , Simón teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish . Clues lead the two to Simón 's adoption file . Simón becomes angry , and says that his new friend told him that Laura is not his biological mother and that he is going to die soon . 
 During a party at the orphanage , Laura and Simón argue , and Simón hides from her . While looking for him , she encounters a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside . Escaping , she finds that Simón is missing and she is unable to find him . That night Laura hears several loud crashes . Police psychologist Pilar ( Mabel Rivera ) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted Simón . 
 Six months later , Simón is still missing . Searching in a Spanish city , Laura spots Benigna who is then struck and killed by a car . The police find evidence that Benigna once worked at the orphanage , and that she had a son named Tomás who was interned there . The children stole a mask that Tomás wore to conceal his deformed face . Embarrassed , Tomás hid in a local sea cave and was subsequently drowned . His death occurred weeks after Laura was adopted . 
 Laura asks for the assistance of a medium named Aurora ( Geraldine Chaplin ) in the search for Simón . Aurora conducts a seance during which she claims to see the ghosts of the orphans crying for help . Laura discovers the remains of the orphans she grew up with in the orphanage . They were killed by Tomás ' mother Benigna who wanted revenge on the children that were not blamed for the death of her son . She stored their remains in the orphanage 's coal shed . Unable to cope with the situation , Carlos leaves the orphanage . 
 Laura recreates the original orphanage layout and attempts to contact the children 's spirits by playing a version of Peek Behind the Curtain . The spirits lead her to the door of a hidden underground room . Inside is Simón 's corpse , wearing Tomás 's mask . Laura finally realizes what happened : while searching for Simón the night he disappeared , Laura moved pieces of construction scaffolding , blocking the entrance to the secret room . The crashes that night were caused by Simón trying to get out . He fell and broke his neck . 
 Laura takes an overdose of sleeping pills . Dying , she begs to be with Simón again and the children 's spirits appear , with Simón among them . Simón tells Laura that his wish was for her to stay and take care of the orphans . Sometime later , Carlos visits a memorial to Laura , Simón and the orphans . Carlos returns to the orphans ' old bedroom and finds a medallion that he had given to Laura . He turns to look as the door opens , and he smiles .

 The first draft of the script of The Orphanage was written by Sergio G. Sánchez in 1996 . Sánchez was not sure why he chose to write a genre film for the screenplay , as he explains , " I ended up writing a film in the style of those I liked as a kid , movies like Poltergeist , The Omen , and Rosemary 's Baby which I ruined on the first VCR we owned at home . " Sánchez revealed the literary influences underlying his writing of the script , such as The Turn of the Screw and Peter Pan . Sánchez originally wanted to direct the script but he was repeatedly turned down by various Spanish production companies . While Sánchez was working on the short film <unk> in 2004 , he met with director Juan Antonio Bayona and offered him the script to direct . Bayona accepted the opportunity because he felt that a fantasy themed script like that of The Orphanage would allow him freedom as a director , saying the fantasy genre was a great tool for learning as it " allows manipulation of space and time as we wish or the use of certain camera moves with an immediate efficiency " . 
 Bayona cut parts of the script , including the outcome of the other orphanage children , because he wanted to focus on the character of Laura and what happens to her . To create the film as he wanted , Bayona had to double both the film 's budget and the amount of filming time . To accomplish this , Bayona received help from fellow film director Guillermo del Toro , whom he had met at Festival de Cine de Sitges when del Toro was presenting his film Cronos ( 1993 ) . Del Toro offered to co @-@ produce the film as soon as he learned about it . For the rest of his crew , Bayona worked with his regular team that he worked with on commercials and music videos . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 During casting discussions between Bayona and del Toro , Bayona expressed a desire to see Belén Rueda in the lead . Bayona admired her after seeing her performance as Julia in Alejandro <unk> 's The Sea Inside . Del Toro appreciated this choice , as he admired her as an actress and liked that Bayona was casting her against type . Bayona asked Rueda to watch The Innocents and Close Encounters of the Third Kind to prepare for the role . Another actress Bayona desired for the film was Geraldine Chaplin in the role of Aurora , the medium . Bayona stated that he wanted the film to have " the mood of 70s Spanish cinema and Geraldine starred in one of the best movies of that decade , Carlos Saura 's The Secret of Anna , as the ghost of the mother . It made sense to have her play the medium . " Bayona was nervous about filming with Chaplin . To break that tension , on the first day of shooting with her Bayona hid under a bed during a scene which required Chaplin to portray Anna kneeling down near it in the dark , and he grabbed Chaplin 's leg when she did so . Anna 's scream in the film is Chaplin 's actual frightened scream as Bayona grabbed her . Roger Príncep 's test @-@ screening was one of the first for the role of Simón . Bayona test @-@ screened over four @-@ hundred children during two months before making his choice to cast <unk> . Edgar Vivar was cast in role of <unk> ; Bayona knew him through his work on the Mexican television series El Chavo and sent him an invitation for the role through e @-@ mail . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Production on The Orphanage began on May 15 , 2006 in <unk> , Asturias . This location was chosen due to the area 's diverse natural settings that include beaches , caves , cliffs , forests , a small village , and the <unk> Manor where the orphanage scenes take place . The orphanage was an old colonial house from the end of the nineteenth century . Bayona wanted to use certain cinematographic techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house , so several parts of the house were reconstructed in sound stages . After four weeks in <unk> , the team moved to Barcelona to finish up the last ten weeks of filming in sound stages , making over 80 % of the film there . Bayona showed the films La <unk> and The Innocents to his director of photography on the film , to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films .

 The Orphanage premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 20 , 2007 . The film was positively received with a ten @-@ minute ovation from the audience . The film 's Spanish debut took place at the Sitges Film Festival on October 4 , 2007 where it opened the festival . The Orphanage had a wide release in Spain on October 11 , 2007 and was immensely successful in Spain after an $ 8 @.@ 3 million four @-@ day launch from 350 screens . The film was the second highest @-@ grossing debut ever for a Spanish film and was the biggest opening of the year , making it even larger than the worldwide success of the Spanish @-@ Mexican film Pan 's Labyrinth . It opened in limited release in the United States on December 28 , 2007 and had a wide release on January 11 , 2008 . It opened in Mexico on January 25 , 2008 and earned over $ 11 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 at the box office . 
 In Spain , the film was nominated for 14 Goya Awards , including Best Picture and ended up winning awards for Best Art Direction , Best Director of Production , Best Makeup and Hair , Best New Director , Best Screenplay – Original , Best Sound Mixing , and Best Special Effects . The Orphanage was chosen by the Spanish Academy of Films as Spain 's nominee for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film , but ultimately did not end up as one of the five final nominees in that category . The Orphanage was picked up by Picturehouse at the Berlin Film Festival for American distribution .

 = = = Remake = = = 
 In 2007 , New Line Cinema bought the rights to produce an English @-@ language remake with Guillermo del Toro as producer . On remakes , director Bayona noted that " The Americans have all the money in the world but can 't do anything , while we can do whatever we want but don 't have the money " and " The American industry doesn 't take chances , that 's why they make remakes of movies that were already big hits " . On August 4 , 2009 , Larry Fessenden was announced as the director of the American remake . Fessenden was later announced that he will not be involved with directing the remake , stating " Working on the script with Guillermo was a very exciting experience , but then I got into a casting miasma and that 's where the thing is ; I think they 're gonna do it another way , actually . So I think I 'm out of it . Hopefully they 'll still use my script , but I 'm not sure I 'm directing it anymore " . In January 2010 , Mark Pellington replaced Larry Fessenden as director of the project . 
 On August 5 , 2011 , Guillermo del Toro stated that the remake would reflect his original vision for the film , and that it had been planned even when the first version was in production . " Even when we produced the Spanish movie , I had intended to remake it because we had a very different screenplay that , because of money and time , got turned into the movie you saw – which is great , but there was this other structure for the original script that I wanted to try . So even before we shot the first film it was an economic decision , a pre @-@ existing creative decision , to change it . " Del Toro also praised the new film 's director . " We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I 'm a big fan of his The Mothman Prophecies and his video work – and we are out to actors , so we 're hoping to get things going soon . " On August 30 , 2011 , it was reported that American actress Amy Adams was in talks to star as Laura , the main character , who was played by Belén Rueda in the original film . It was also stated that the current incarnation of the remake screenplay had been written by Larry Fessenden and Sergio G. Sánchez , the sole writer of the original film .

 The Orphanage was received very well by American critics on its original release . The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 87 % of critics had given the film positive reviews , based upon a sample of 168 . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film has received an average score of 74 , based on 33 reviews . Critics praised the film for its lack of cheap scares . Film critic for the Chicago Sun Times Roger Ebert approved of the film claiming it to be " deliberately aimed at viewers with developed attention spans . It lingers to create atmosphere , a sense of place , a sympathy with the characters , instead of rushing into cheap thrills " . Bill Goodykoontz of the Arizona Republic echoed this statement noting , " Bayona never lets The Orphanage descend into cheap horror . The scares here are expertly done and , placed in the context of Laura 's state of mind , well @-@ earned , perhaps even explainable ( or not ) . " Peter Howell of the Toronto Star wrote , " The year 's best horror picture is also one of the simplest . The Orphanage makes little if any use of digital tricks to present its numerous terrors . " The casting of Chaplin and Rueda was praised while the role of Carlos was called dull . Goodykoontz noted the role of Carlos , saying " Cayo is rather pedestrian as Carlos , but he isn 't given that much to do " . Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune shared this opinion saying , " Rueda has a great pair of peepers for this assignment . When she looks one way and then the other , while skulking through the hallways of her childhood home , every nerve @-@ wracking <unk> ? registers , and how . Cayo is pretty dull by comparison , but Chaplin certainly is not . " Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail praised Rueda stating , " The strongest appeal of the film is the brooding , intense performance by Spanish actress , Belen Rueda . " 
 A negative review came from Lacey of The Globe and Mail , who felt that at " [ the film 's ] core , it seems intended as a sympathetic drama of a bereaved mother , who may have slipped into madness . What 's even more disquieting is the persistent undercurrent of exploitation – the mixture of grief and jarring shock effects and the pitiless use of a disfigured child as a source of horror . " A.O. Scott of The New York Times claimed the film to be a " diverting , overwrought ghost story " and that it " relies on basic and durable horror movie techniques " . Jack Matthews of New York Daily News found the ending of the film to be one of the worst of the season , but praised the acting of Belén Rueda . 
 The Orphanage listed as one of the top 10 best films of 2007 by several critics , including Lawrence Toppman of the Charlotte Observer , Marc Doyle of Metacritic and Tasha Robinson of The AV Club . Anthony Lane of The New Yorker included the film on his top ten list of 2008 . In the early 2010s , Time Out conducted a poll with several authors , directors , actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films . The Orphanage placed at number 76 on their top 100 list .

 = Russian battleship Oryol = 
 Oryol ( Russian : <unk> ) was a Borodino @-@ class battleship built for the Russian Imperial Navy in the first decade of the 20th century . The ship was completed a few months before the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War in February 1904 and was assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron sent to the Far East six months later to break the Japanese blockade of Port Arthur . The Japanese captured the port while the squadron was in transit and their destination was changed to Vladivostok . Oryol was badly damaged during the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905 and surrendered to the Japanese who put her into service under the name of Iwami ( Japanese : <unk> ) . 
 Reconstructed by the Japanese in 1905 – 1907 , Iwami was reclassified by the Imperial Japanese Navy as a coastal defence ship in 1912 . She participated in the Battle of Tsingtao at the beginning of World War I and supported the Japanese troops that landed in Siberia in 1918 during the Russian Civil War . Iwami was used as a training ship beginning in September 1921 . The ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and sunk as a target ship in 1924 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The five Borodino @-@ class predreadnought battleships were the centerpiece of Tsar Nicholas II 's naval building program , " For the Needs of the Far East " , that was intended to defend his newly leased warm @-@ water port at Port Arthur , China . He had obtained the lease after the Triple Intervention by France , Russia , and Germany forced Japan to return it to China after the Japanese victory in the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 . The Russian lease was seen as adding insult to injury by the Japanese and confirmed that the two countries were on a collision course over their spheres of influence in Korea and China . 
 One of the first battleships ordered as part of the program was the French @-@ designed and built Tsesarevich and the Imperial Russian Navy also purchased a license to build more ships in domestic shipyards . The Borodinos were derived from the design of Tsesarevich , enlarged to suit Russian equipment , but with significantly thinner armor to reduce weight . Oryol was 397 feet ( 121 @.@ 0 m ) long overall , had a beam of 76 feet 1 inch ( 23 @.@ 19 m ) and a draft of around 29 feet 2 inches ( 8 @.@ 9 m ) at deep load . Designed to displace 13 @,@ 516 long tons ( 13 @,@ 733 t ) , she was more than 600 long tons ( 610 t ) overweight and actually displaced 14 @,@ 151 long tons ( 14 @,@ 378 t ) . This caused a problem during her sister 's sea trials on 6 October 1903 when Imperator Aleksandr III made a high @-@ speed turn that caused her to heel 15 ° and submerged the embrasures for the 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns . The ship 's crew consisted of 28 officers and 826 enlisted men . Her design was based on that of the Tsesarevich , modified to suit Russian machinery . 
 The ship was powered by two four @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines using steam generated by 20 Belleville boilers . The engines were rated at 15 @,@ 800 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 800 kW ) and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . Oryol 's engines , however , only achieved 14 @,@ 176 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 571 kW ) during her official machinery trials on 10 September 1904 , although the ship was able to reach her designed speed . She carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 370 t ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 2 @,@ 590 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 800 km ; 2 @,@ 980 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ship 's main battery consisted of four 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one forward and one aft of the superstructure . The secondary armament consisted of 12 Canet 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns , mounted in twin @-@ gun turrets . A number of smaller guns were carried for defence against torpedo boats . These included twenty 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) QF guns and twenty 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns . She was also armed with four 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , one each at the bow and stern above water and two submerged on the broadside . Oryol 's waterline armor belt consisted of Krupp armor and was 5 @.@ 7 – 7 @.@ 64 inches ( 145 – 194 mm ) thick . The armor of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 10 in ( 254 mm ) and her deck ranged from 1 to 2 inches ( 25 to 51 mm ) in thickness . She had anti @-@ torpedo bulkheads 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick . 
 = = Service = = 
 Construction began on Oryol ( Eagle ) on 7 November 1899 at the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg . The ship was laid down on 1 June 1900 and launched on 19 July 1901 . While fitting out in Kronstadt in May 1904 in preparation for the installation of her armor , some temporary sheathing was removed that allowed water to enter and sank the ship five days later . The water was pumped out and the ship refloated without incident . She was completed in October 1904 at the cost of 13 @,@ 404 @,@ 000 rubles . 
 On 15 October 1904 , Oryol set sail for Port Arthur from Libau along with the other vessels of the Second Pacific Squadron , under the overall command of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky . Rozhestvensky led his squadron down the Atlantic coast of Africa , rounding the Cape of Good Hope , and reached the island of Nosy Be off the north @-@ west coast of Madagascar on 9 January 1905 where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements . The squadron sailed for Camranh Bay , French Indochina , on 16 March and reached it almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the 3rd Pacific Squadron , commanded by Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov . The latter ships reached Camranh Bay on 9 May and the combined force sailed for Vladivostok on 14 May . With all of the additional coal and other supplies loaded for the lengthy voyage , the ship was 1 @,@ 785 long tons ( 1 @,@ 814 t ) overweight ; most of which was stored high in the ship and reduced her stability . The most important aspect of this , however , was that the additional weight completely submerged the ship 's main armor belt . 
 Rozhestvensky decided to take the most direct route to Vladivostok using the Tsushima Strait and was intercepted by the Japanese battlefleet under the command of Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō on 27 May 1905 . At the beginning of the battle , Oryol was the last ship in line of the 1st Division , which consisted of all four Borodino @-@ class battleships under Rozhestvensky 's direct command . The ship fired the first shots of the Battle of Tsushima when the ship 's captain , Nikolay Yung , ordered her to open fire at a Japanese cruiser that was shadowing the Russian formation at a range of 9 @,@ 000 meters ( 9 @,@ 800 yd ) . Rozhestvensky had not given any pre @-@ battle instructions to the fleet covering this situation , but he ordered Yung to cease fire after 30 rounds had been fired without effect . 
 Oryol was not heavily engaged during the early part of the battle , but she was set on fire by Japanese shells during this time . About an hour after the battle began , the Japanese cruiser Chihaya fired two torpedoes at a ship that may have been Oryol , although both torpedoes missed . The Russian formation had become disordered during the early part of the battle and Oryol was second in line after her sister Borodino by 16 : 00 . The Japanese battleships generally concentrated their fire on Borodino during this time and sank her around 19 : 30 . Oryol was hit a number of times as well , but was not seriously damaged . 
 Oryol took the lead after Borodino was sunk ; she was joined by Nebogatov 's Second Division after Tōgō ordered the Japanese battleships to disengage in the gathering darkness . Nebogatov assumed command of the remains of the fleet and they continued towards Vladivostok . The ships were discovered by the Japanese early the following morning and attacked by Tōgō 's battleships around 10 : 00 . The faster Japanese ships stayed beyond the range at which Nebogatov 's ships could effectively reply and he decided to surrender his ships at 10 : 30 as he could neither return fire nor close the range . The ship was formally stricken from the Navy List on 13 September 1905 . 
 During the battle , Oryol was probably hit by five 12 @-@ inch , two 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) , nine 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) , thirty @-@ nine 6 @-@ inch shells , and 21 smaller rounds or fragments . Although the ship had many large holes in the unarmored portions of her side , she was only moderately damaged as all of the four ( one 12 @-@ inch and three 6 @-@ inch ) shells that hit her side armor failed to penetrate . The left gun of her forward 12 @-@ inch turret had been struck by an 8 @-@ inch shell that broke off its muzzle and another 8 @-@ inch shell struck the roof of the rear 12 @-@ inch turret and forced it down , which limited the maximum elevation of the left gun . Two 6 @-@ inch gun turrets had been jammed by hits from 8 @-@ inch shells and one of them had been burnt out by an ammunition fire . Another turret had been damaged by a 12 @-@ inch shell that struck its supporting tube . Splinters from two 6 @-@ inch shells entered the conning tower and wounded Yung badly enough that he later died of his wounds . Casualties totaled 43 crewmen killed and approximately 80 wounded . 
 = = Japanese career as Iwami = = 
 As Oryol followed the First Division of the Combined Fleet back to Japan after the battle , she developed a list to starboard and her engines began to fail . Escorted ( and occasionally towed ) by the battleship Asahi and the armored cruiser Asama , she was diverted to Maizuru Naval Arsenal for emergency repairs that lasted until 29 July . While under repair , she was renamed Iwami on 6 June , after the eponymous province , now part of Shimane prefecture . 
 The Japanese substantially rebuilt Iwami at Kure Naval Arsenal and officially recommissioned her into the Imperial Japanese Navy on 2 November 1907 . To reduce her top weight , her funnels were shortened , her fighting tops removed , and her superstructure reduced in height . Her twin six @-@ inch gun turrets were removed and replaced by half a dozen eight @-@ inch guns on pedestal mounts that were protected by gun shields . The fore and aft eight @-@ inch guns were repositioned one deck lower , on the same level as the midships guns , and the midships 75 @-@ millimeter gun positions were plated over . The 75 @-@ millimeter guns were replaced by sixteen Japanese @-@ built QF 12 @-@ pounder , 12 cwt guns and two submerged broadside 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament . Her boilers were replaced by an unknown number of Japanese @-@ built Miyabara water @-@ tube boilers . These changes reduced her displacement to approximately 13 @,@ 500 long tons ( 13 @,@ 700 t ) and her crew now totaled 806 officers and crewmen . 
 Iwami was assigned to the 1st Fleet on 26 November 1907 although she participated in the 1908 naval maneuvers as part of the 2nd Fleet before rejoining the 1st Fleet the following year . On 1 September 1912 , the ship was reclassified as a second @-@ class coastal defense ship . Shortly after the start of World War I in 1914 , Iwami was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet , formed from captured Russian ships . The division blockaded the port and bombarded German defenses during the Siege of Tsingtao in August – November 1914 . In 1915 Iwami was a guardship at Kure , but she did participate in that year 's naval maneuvers and subsequent fleet review . 
 She was assigned to the 5th Division of the 3rd Fleet on 7 January 1918 as its flagship and landed a company of marines in Vladivostok five days later at the start of the Japanese intervention in Siberia during the Russian Civil War . Iwami returned to Kure on 9 September and was subsequently relieved from her assignment with the 3rd Fleet . The ship was assigned to defend Kamchatka from 24 September 1920 to 30 June 1921 and was based in Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk . She was reclassified as a first @-@ class coast defense ship in September 1921 and was used as a training ship . In accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty , Japan agreed to scrap Iwami . She was disarmed in April 1922 and used as a depot ship until she was struck on 1 September . Iwami moored to the west of the island of <unk> near the mouth of Tokyo Bay and used as a target by aircraft of the Yokosuka Naval Air Group from 5 – 8 July , finally sinking on 10 July 1924 . 
 = Giant mouse lemur = 
 The giant mouse lemurs ( members of the genus Mirza ) are a genus of strepsirrhine primates . Two species have been formally described ; the northern giant mouse lemur ( Mirza zaza ) and Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur ( Mirza coquereli ) . Like all other lemurs , they are native to Madagascar , where they are found in the western dry deciduous forests and further to the north in the Sambirano valley and Sahamalaza Peninsula . First described in 1867 as a single species , they were grouped with mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs . In 1870 , British zoologist John Edward Gray assigned them to their own genus , Mirza . The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s , which followed the revival of the genus by American paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall in 1982 . In 2005 , the northern population was declared a new species , and in 2010 , the World Wide Fund for Nature announced that a southwestern population might also be a new species . 
 Giant mouse lemurs are about three times larger than mouse lemurs , weighing approximately 300 g ( 11 oz ) , and have a long , bushy tail . They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within Cheirogaleidae , a family of small , nocturnal lemurs . Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests during the day and forage alone at night for fruit , tree gum , insects , and small vertebrates . Unlike many other cheirogaleids , they do not enter a state of torpor during the dry season . The northern species is generally more social than the southern species , particularly when nesting , though males and females may form pair bonds . The northern species also has the largest testicle size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year @-@ round instead of seasonally . Home ranges often overlap , with related females living closely together while males disperse . Giant mouse lemurs are vocal , although they also scent mark using saliva , urine , and secretions from the anogenital scent gland . 
 Predators of giant mouse lemurs include the Madagascar buzzard , Madagascar owl , fossa , and the narrow @-@ striped mongoose . Giant mouse lemurs reproduce once a year , with two offspring born after a 90 @-@ day gestation . Babies are initially left in the nest while the mother forages , but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby . In captivity , giant mouse lemurs will breed year @-@ round . Their lifespan in the wild is thought to be five to six years . Both species are listed as endangered due to habitat destruction and hunting . Like all lemurs , they are protected under CITES Appendix I , which prohibits commercial trade . Despite breeding easily , they are rarely kept in captivity . The Duke Lemur Center coordinated the captive breeding of an imported collection of the northern species , which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62 individuals by 1989 , but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The first species of giant mouse lemur was described by the French naturalist Alfred Grandidier in 1867 based on seven individuals he had collected near Morondava in southwestern Madagascar . Of these seven specimens , the lectotype was selected in 1939 as MNHN 1867 – 603 , an adult skull and skin . Naming the species after the French entomologist Charles Coquerel , Grandidier placed Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur ( M. coquereli ) with the dwarf lemurs in the genus Cheirogaleus ( which he spelled <unk> ) as C. coquereli . He selected this generic assignment based on similarities with fork @-@ marked lemurs ( Phaner ) , which he considered to also be members of Cheirogaleus . The following year , the German naturalist Hermann Schlegel and Dutch naturalist François Pollen independently described the same species and coincidentally gave it the same specific name , coquereli , basing theirs on an individual from around the Bay of Ampasindava in northern Madagascar . Unlike Grandidier , they placed their specimen in the genus Microcebus ( mouse lemurs ) ; however , these authors also listed all Cheirogaleus under Microcebus and based the classification of their species on similarities with the greater dwarf lemur ( M. <unk> , now C. major ) . 
 In 1870 , the British zoologist John Edward Gray placed Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur into its own genus , Mirza . This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists Ernst Schwarz , Guillaume Grandidier , and others , who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in Microcebus . British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill also favored this view in 1953 , noting that despite its larger size ( comparable to Cheirogaleus ) , its first upper premolar was proportionally small as in Microcebus . In 1977 , French zoologist Jean @-@ Jacques Petter also favored the Microcebus classification , despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur and the other members of the genus . 
 The genus Mirza was resurrected in 1982 by American paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall to represent an intermediate branch between Microcebus and Cheirogaleus , citing the Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur 's significantly larger size than the largest Microcebus and locomotor behavior more closely aligned with Cheirogaleus . Adoption of Mirza was slow , though in 1994 it was used in the first edition of Lemurs of Madagascar by Conservation International . In 1993 , primatologist Colin Groves initially favored the Microcebus classification in the second edition of Mammal Species of the World , but began supporting the resurrection of Mirza in 2001 . In 1991 , prior to adopting Mirza , Groves was the first to use the common name " giant mouse lemur " . Prior to that , they were popularly referred to as " Coquerel 's mouse lemur " . 
 In 2005 , Peter M. Kappeler and Christian Roos described a new species of giant mouse lemur , the northern giant mouse lemur ( M. zaza ) . Their studies compared the morphology , behavioral ecology , and mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences of specimens from both Kirindy Forest in central @-@ western Madagascar and around Ambato in northwestern Madagascar , part of the Sambirano valley . Their study demonstrated distinct differences in size , sociality , and breeding , as well as sufficient genetic distance to merit specific distinction between the northern and central @-@ western populations . Because Grandidier 's description was based on a southern specimen , they named the northern population as a new species . 
 The World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) announced in 2010 that a biodiversity study from 2009 in the gallery forest of Ranobe near Toliara in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown to science , and possibly a new species . They noted a significant difference in coloration between the two known species and the specimen they observed . However , further testing was required to confirm the discovery . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The etymology of Mirza puzzled researchers for many years . Gray often created mysterious and unexplained taxonomic names — a trend not only continued with his description of Mirza in 1870 , but also with the genera Phaner ( fork @-@ marked lemurs ) and Azema ( for M. rufus , now a synonym for Microcebus ) , both of which were described in the same publication . In 1904 , American zoologist Theodore Sherman Palmer attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa , but could not definitively explain these three genera . For Mirza , Palmer only noted that it derived from the Persian title <unk> ( " prince " ) , a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel , Jelle Zijlstra , and Groves in 2012 . However , because the reference to Persian princes might have come from Arabian Nights , a popular piece of literature at the time , Dunkel et al. also searched the general literature published around 1870 . The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy The Palace of Truth by W. S. Gilbert , which premiered in London on 19 November 1870 , nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray 's manuscript ( also published in London ) . The comedy featured characters bearing all three names : King Phanor ( sic ) , Mirza , and Azema . The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 Based on studies using morphology , immunology , repetitive DNA , SINE analysis , multilocus phylogenetic tests , and mitochondrial genes ( mtDNA ) , giant mouse lemurs are most closely related to mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae , and together they form a clade with the hairy @-@ eared dwarf lemur ( Allocebus ) . Both dwarf lemurs and fork @-@ marked lemurs are more distantly related , with fork @-@ marked lemurs being either a sister group of all cheirogaleids , or more closely related to sportive lemurs ( Lepilemur ) . 
 Although Mirza , Microcebus , and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae , the three lineages are thought to have diverged during a narrow window of time , so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research . All three are thought to have diverged at least 20 mya ( million years ago ) , although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24 @.@ 2 mya . Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2 @.@ 1 mya . 
 = = Description = = 
 Though giant mouse lemurs are relatively small cheirogaleids , they are more than three times larger than the smallest members of the family , the mouse lemurs . Their body weight averages 300 g ( 11 oz ) . At around 300 mm ( 12 in ) , their bushy and long tail is longer than their head @-@ body length , which averages 233 mm ( 9 @.@ 2 in ) . Their forelimbs are shorter than the hind limbs ( with an intermembral index of 70 ) , a trait shared with mouse lemurs . The skull is similar to that of dwarf and mouse lemurs , and the auditory bullae are small . 
 Like other cheirogaleids , the dental formula for giant mouse lemurs is 2 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 @.@ 32 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 @.@ 3 × 2 = 36 ; on each side of the mouth , top and bottom , there are two incisors , one canine , three premolars , and three molars — a total of 36 teeth . Their upper teeth converge towards the front of the mouth , but are straighter than those in mouse lemurs . The first upper premolar ( P2 ) is relatively small , but nearly as tall as the next premolar ( P3 ) . Unlike mouse lemurs and more like dwarf lemurs , giant mouse lemurs have a prominent anterior lower premolar ( P2 ) . Also more aligned with dwarf lemurs , the first two upper molars ( M1 – 2 ) have a more anterior hypocone that sits opposite the metacone , compared to the mouse lemurs ' more posterior hypocone , which is presumably a symplesiomorphic ( ancestral ) trait . Also on M1 and M2 , the cingulum ( a crest or ridge on the tongue side ) comprises two small cuspules . In all other dental characteristics , giant mouse lemurs are noticeably similar to both dwarf and mouse lemurs . 
 Giant mouse lemurs have two pairs of mammae , one on the chest ( pectoral ) and one on the abdomen ( abdominal ) . Their fur is typically grayish @-@ brown on the dorsal ( back ) side and more gray in color on the ventral ( front ) side . The tail is typically black @-@ tipped . The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color , along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs . This population also has a red tail , which darkens at the end . Vibrissae are found above the eyes ( superciliary ) , above the mouth ( buccal ) , under the lower jaw ( genal ) , near the top of the jaw ( interramal ) , and on the wrist ( carpal ) . Like mouse lemurs , the ears are large and membranous . 
 Ear size is one differentiating factor between the northern giant mouse lemur and Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur , with the former having shorter , rounded ears , while the latter has relatively large ears . The northern giant mouse lemur is generally larger and also has a shorter tail and shorter canine teeth . This species also has the largest testicles relative to body size of any living primate , with an average volume of 15 @.@ 48 cm3 ( 0 @.@ 945 cu in ) , corresponding to 5 @.@ 5 % of its body weight . If human males had comparably sized testes , they would weigh 4 kg ( 8 @.@ 8 lb ) and be the size of a grapefruit . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur has a spotty distribution across western Madagascar 's dry deciduous forests due to the forest fragmentation throughout the region . The dry forests in this lowland region vary in elevation from sea level to 700 m ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) . The range of this species is divided into northern and southern subpopulations , which are separated by several hundred kilometers . Both historical and current populations between these ranges are uncertain . The southern region is bound by the Onilahy River in the south and the <unk> River in the north , while the northern population is found in the northwestern corner of the island at <unk> de Namoroka National Park . They are most commonly found in forests near rivers and ponds . 
 The northern giant mouse lemur is found in isolated forest patches along the northwest coast in both the more humid Sambirano valley and Sahamalaza Peninsula , as well as the Ampasindava Peninsula . Its range extends from the <unk> River in the south to the <unk> River in the north . The new population reported by the WWF in 2010 is found in the gallery forests of Ranobe near Toliara in southwestern Madagascar . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 Giant mouse lemurs were first studied in the wild by Petter and colleagues in 1971 . His observations were secondary to his primary research interest , the fork @-@ marked lemurs north of Morondava . Both northern and southern populations were studied intermittently between 1978 and 1981 , and in 1993 , long @-@ term social and genetic studies began in Kirindy Forest . Behavioral studies of captive individuals have also been performed at the Duke Lemur Center ( DLC ) in Durham , North Carolina during the 1990s . 
 = = = Population density and territory = = = 
 Before the recognition of more than one species , differences in population density were noted between southern forests like Kirindy and northern forests near Ambanja . Later , it was recognized that Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur was found in lower densities than the northern giant mouse lemur . The former range between 30 and 210 individuals per square kilometer ( 250 acres ) , with lower densities in open areas of the forest , while the latter has been recorded with 385 to 1 @,@ 086 individuals per km2 . However , in the case of the northern giant mouse lemur , populations were found in more isolated forest fragments and it is thought that their consumption of introduced cashew and mango help sustain these higher populations . 
 According to studies of Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur , home ranges of both sexes vary from 1 to 4 hectares ( 2 to 10 acres ) with frequent overlap , particularly on the periphery of their range . Individuals most heavily use and aggressively defend a smaller core area within their range . Individuals can have up to eight neighbors . Home ranges of males tend to overlap with those of both females and other males , and typically expand to four times the size during the mating season . Female home ranges show no variability in size , and can remain stable for years . At Kirindy Forest , genetic studies showed that the home ranges of related females tend to clump closely together , while unrelated males may overlap their range , suggesting male dispersal and migration is responsible for gene flow . 
 = = = Activity patterns = = = 
 Both species are strictly nocturnal , leaving their nests around sunset to stretch and self @-@ groom for a few minutes . Both species typically forage between 5 and 10 m ( 16 and 33 ft ) above the forest floor , though Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur has been observed on the ground . They primarily move by quadrupedal running and occasionally leaping between branches , and use the same feeding postures as mouse lemurs , such as clinging to tree trunks . When moving through the trees , giant mouse lemurs scurry rapidly like mouse lemurs , unlike dwarf lemurs , which use more deliberate movement . Slow movements are usually seen in lower , denser foliage when hunting for insects , while more rapid motion and leaping is typically seen at moderate heights of 2 – 5 m ( 6 @.@ 6 – 16 ft ) . Surveillance of the home range involves slower movements in lighter foliage near the tops of large trees , while movements along the border of a home range is more rapid and occurs at a lower height . Similar movement patterns have been observed in captivity as well . 
 Giant mouse lemurs begin foraging moments before the sun disappears , occasionally participate in social activities during the last half of the night , and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise . Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early , sometime during the second half of the night . During the first half of the night , giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more , usually at the expense of social activities , but not feeding time . Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low . Unlike many other cheirogaleids , they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor . 
 = = = Nesting = = = 
 Both species sleep in round nests up to 50 cm ( 20 in ) across made of interlaced lianas , branches , leaves , and twigs gathered from nearby trees and woven using the mouth and hands . Nests are typically between 2 and 10 m ( 6 @.@ 6 and 33 ft ) above the ground in the fork of large tree branches or surrounded by dense lianas . Trees covered in thick lianas as well as trees with year @-@ round leaf cover ( e.g. Euphorbiaceae ) are favored for nest construction , though large bare trees may be used by building the nest higher . In addition to nesting in dense lianas , individual giant mouse lemurs will rotate between 10 and 12 nests every few days to avoid predators . Only females have been observed building nests in the wild , though males , females , and young have been observed building nests in captivity . Multiple nests are sometimes built in the same tree or in nearby trees and are shared by neighboring giant mouse lemurs , fork @-@ marked lemurs , and the introduced black rat ( Rattus rattus ) . Unlike most other nocturnal lemurs , giant mouse lemurs do not appear to sleep in tree holes . 
 = = = Social structure = = = 
 Both species usually are solitary foragers , although the northern giant mouse lemur tends to be the most social , possibly due to its higher population density . Up to eight ( typically four ) adult males , adult females , and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest , whereas Coquerel 's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally , except when females share their nest with their offspring . Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact , and according to radio @-@ tracking and direct observations at <unk> near Kirindy , they form pair bonds , sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season . However , most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas , often involving chases and other agonistic behavior , and only rarely social grooming . During the mating season , males act aggressively towards one another , pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head . 
 Giant mouse lemurs use at least eight vocalizations , the most common of which are contact calls , which sound like " hum " or a " <unk> " and are used when moving and when meeting familiar individuals . A " mother @-@ infant meeting call " used at dawn before returning to the nest consists of short , modulated whistles . Both males and females have distinct single note calls used in territorial behavior ; the female call sounds like " <unk> " and the male call is a short , loud whistle . Both sexes use an alarm call , which sounds like a " croak " , and an agonistic call , which consists of repeated " tisk @-@ tisk @-@ tisk " sounds . Females exhibit a " waking call sequence " , sometimes referred to as " loud calls " , which start when foraging commences and then switch to quieter " hon " calls possibly to indicate their position to their neighbors . A long " sexual call sequence " consisting of soft whistle and several modulated , hoarse " <unk> " calls is used by both sexes during estrus . Studies of captive individuals have found other vocalizations , but their purpose has not been determined . The northern giant mouse lemur appears to be the most vocal of the two species . Although vocalizations are the primary form of social communication , they also scent mark using saliva , urine , and secretions from the anogenital scent gland on small branches and other objects . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Reproduction starts in November for Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest ; the estrous cycle runs approximately 22 days , while estrus lasts only a day or less . The mating season in this southern population is limited to a few weeks , whereas the northern giant mouse lemur is thought to breed throughout the year , a trend seen in only two other species of lemur : the aye @-@ aye ( Daubentonia madagascariensis ) and the red @-@ bellied lemur ( Eulemur rubriventer ) . The northern giant mouse lemur had been observed breeding year @-@ round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed , but at the time this population was thought to be Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur . 
 One to three offspring ( typically two ) are born after 90 days of gestation , weighing approximately 12 g ( 0 @.@ 42 oz ) . Because they are poorly developed , they initially remain in their mother 's nest for up to three weeks , being transported by mouth between nests . Once they have grown sufficiently , typically after three weeks , the mother will park her offspring in vegetation while she forages nearby . After a month , the young begin to participate in social play and grooming with their mother , and between the first and second month , young males begin to exhibit early sexual behaviors ( including mounting , neck biting , and pelvic thrusting ) . By the third month , the young forage independently , though they maintain vocal contact with their mother and use a small part of her range . 
 Females start reproducing after ten months , while males develop functional testicles by their second mating season . Testicle size in the northern giant mouse lemur does not appear to fluctuate by season , and is so large relative to the animal 's body mass that it is the highest among all primates . This emphasis on sperm production in males , as well as the use of copulatory plugs , suggests a mating system best described as polygynandrous where males use scramble competition ( roaming widely to find many females ) . In contrast , male Coquerel 's giant mouse lemurs appear to fight for access to females ( contest competition ) during their breeding season . Males disperse from their natal range , and the age at which they leave varies from two years to several . Females reproduce every year , although postpartum estrus has been observed in captivity . In the wild , the lifespan of giant mouse lemurs is thought to rarely exceed five or six years , though in captivity they can live up to 15 years . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Both species are omnivorous , eating fruit , flowers , buds , insect excretions , tree gums , large insects , spiders , frogs , chameleons , snakes , small birds , and eggs . Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur is thought to opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an individual was found with a half @-@ eaten gray mouse lemur ( M. murinus ) in a trap . During June and July , at the peak of the dry season , this species relies on sugary excretions from the larvae of hemipteran and cochineal insects as well as tree gums . The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony . During this time of year , feeding on insect secretions can account for 60 % of feeding activity . In contrast , the northern giant mouse lemur relies on cashew fruits during the dry season . 
 Giant mouse lemurs are often sympatric with mouse lemurs , such as M. murinus , though they are typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker , taller gallery forests . At the Marosalaza forest ( north of Morondava ) , Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs ( mouse lemurs , sportive lemurs , dwarf lemurs , and fork @-@ marked lemurs ) , but manages niche differentiation by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season . 
 Diurnal birds of prey such as the Madagascar buzzard ( Buteo brachypterus ) are their most significant predators . Other documented predators of giant mouse lemurs include the fossa ( Cryptoprocta ferox ) , Madagascar owl ( Asio madagascariensis ) , and the narrow @-@ striped mongoose ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 In 2012 , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) assessed both Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur and the northern giant mouse lemur as endangered . Prior to that , both species had been listed as vulnerable . Populations of both species are in decline due to habitat destruction , primarily for slash @-@ and @-@ burn agriculture and charcoal production . Also , they are both hunted for bushmeat . The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area , <unk> @-@ Ranobe , which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co @-@ managed by the WWF . Its forests were not included in the protected area due to existing concessions for mining activities . 
 As with all lemurs , giant mouse lemurs were first protected in 1969 when they were listed as " Class A " of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources . This prohibited hunting and capture without authorization , which would only be given for scientific purposes or the national interest . In 1973 , they were also protected under CITES Appendix I , which strictly regulates their trade and forbids commercial trade . Although enforcement is patchy , they are also protected under Malagasy law . 
 Giant mouse lemurs are rarely kept in captivity , though they breed easily . In 1989 , the Duke Lemur Center held more than 70 % of the captive population ( 45 of 62 individuals ) . At the time , the DLC was coordinating a captive breeding program for Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur , and all individuals kept at American facilities were descended from six individuals imported by the DLC in 1982 from the region around Ambanja . As of 2009 , the International Species Information System ( ISIS ) recorded only six remaining individuals registered in the United States and Europe , all reclassified as northern giant mouse lemurs and considered a non @-@ breeding population ; and in 2015 , only a single female remained on record . 
 = French cruiser Dupuy de Lôme = 
 Dupuy de Lôme was an armoured cruiser built for the French Navy ( Marine Nationale ) during the late 1880s and 1890s . She is considered by some to be the world 's first armoured cruiser and was intended to attack enemy merchant ships . The ship was named after the naval architect Henri Dupuy de Lôme . Dupuy de Lôme 's completion was delayed by almost two years by problems with her boilers , but she was finally commissioned in 1895 and assigned to the Northern Squadron ( Escadre du Nord ) , based at Brest , for most of her career . The ship made a number of visits to foreign ports before she began a lengthy reconstruction in 1902 . By the time this was completed in 1906 , the cruiser was regarded as obsolete and Dupuy de Lôme was placed in reserve , aside from one assignment in Morocco . 
 The ship was sold to the Peruvian Navy in 1912 , but they never paid the last two installments and the ship remained inactive at Brest during World War I. The French agreed to take the ship back in 1917 , keeping the money already paid , and they sold her in 1918 to a Belgian shipping company that converted her into a freighter . Renamed Péruvier , the ship 's engines broke down and she had to be towed to her destination where part of her cargo of coal was discovered to be on fire during her maiden voyage as a merchant vessel in 1920 . Deemed uneconomical to repair , Péruvier was towed to Antwerp and later scrapped in 1923 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Dupuy de Lôme was designed to fill the commerce @-@ raiding strategy of the Jeune École . Considered by some the first true armoured cruiser , she was superior to existing British and Italian protected cruisers , especially in her relatively thick steel armour . She could control the engagement range with her superior speed and her heavy armament of quick @-@ firing guns , all of which were mounted in gun turrets , in marked contrast to her intended opponents who mounted their guns in lightly protected casemates or pivot mounts . 
 The ship measured 114 metres ( 374 ft 0 in ) between perpendiculars , with a beam of 15 @.@ 7 metres ( 51 ft 6 in ) . Dupuy de Lôme had a mean draught of 7 @.@ 07 metres ( 23 ft 2 in ) and displaced 6 @,@ 301 tonnes ( 6 @,@ 201 long tons ) at normal load . At deep load , she displaced 6 @,@ 682 tonnes ( 6 @,@ 576 long tons ) and had a metacentric height of only 0 @.@ 695 metres ( 2 ft 3 @.@ 4 in ) . This gave the ship a long , slow roll and made her an uncertain gunnery platform . Her long , cut @-@ away bow resembled a spur @-@ type ram , but was not armoured . It was reduced in profile to reduce blast damage when the forward guns were fired . Dupuy de Lôme was fitted with two large military masts . 
 She had three triple @-@ expansion steam engines , a vertical type for the centre shaft and horizontal types for the outboard shafts . Each engine drove a single propeller shaft , with propellers 4 @.@ 2 metres ( 13 ft 9 in ) in diameter on the outboard shaft and a 4 @.@ 4 @-@ metre ( 14 ft 5 in ) propeller on the centre shaft . Steam for the engines was provided by 11 <unk> fire @-@ tube boilers and they were rated at a total of 14 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 10 @,@ 000 kW ) . The ship had a designed speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) , but during sea trials on 2 April 1895 the engines only produced 13 @,@ 186 metric horsepower ( 9 @,@ 698 kW ) that gave a maximum speed of 19 @.@ 73 knots ( 36 @.@ 54 km / h ; 22 @.@ 70 mph ) . Dupuy de Lôme carried up to 1 @,@ 080 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 060 long tons ; 1 @,@ 190 short tons ) of coal and could steam for 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 400 km ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 12 @.@ 5 knots ( 23 @.@ 2 km / h ; 14 @.@ 4 mph ) . 
 Dupuy de Lôme 's main armament consisted of two 45 @-@ calibre Canon de 194 mm Modèle 1887 guns that were mounted in single gun turrets , one on each broadside amidships . Her secondary armament comprised six 45 @-@ calibre Canon de 164 mm Modèle 1887 guns , three each in single gun turrets at the bow and stern . The three turrets at the stern were all on the upper deck and could interfere with each other . For anti @-@ torpedo boat defence , she carried ten 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) and four 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns . She was also armed with four 450 @-@ millimetre ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) pivoting torpedo tubes ; two mounted on each broadside above water . 
 The whole side of the ship was protected by 100 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) of steel armour , from the bottom edge of the protective deck 1 @.@ 38 metres ( 4 ft 6 in ) below the waterline to the edge of the weather deck . The curved protective deck had a total thickness of 30 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) and did not rise above the ship 's waterline . Protecting the boiler rooms , engine rooms , and magazines below it was a splinter deck 8 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) thick . The space between the protective and splinter decks could be filled with coal to increase the effective thickness of the ship 's armour . It was very cramped there and the coal was very difficult to access . A watertight internal cofferdam , filled with cellulose , ran the length of Dupuy de Lôme from the protective deck to a height of 1 metre ( 3 ft 3 in ) above the waterline . Below the protective deck the ship was divided by 13 watertight transverse bulkheads with three more above the protective deck . The ship 's conning tower was protected by 125 mm ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) and her turrets by 100 mm of armour .

 Dupuy de Lôme was laid down at the Brest shipyard on 4 July 1888 and she was launched on 27 October 1890 . A number of her forged steel armour plates proved to be defective during tests as the metallurgical techniques to harden it were still under development , but most plates were accepted anyway . The ship was commissioned for preliminary sea trials on 1 April 1892 and one boiler tube burst on 20 June , burning 16 men . The necessary modifications to fix the problem delayed the ship 's completion by almost a year . Further testing in October 1893 , showed that Dupuy de Lôme 's engines could only attain 10 @,@ 180 metric horsepower ( 7 @,@ 490 kW ) during a 24 @-@ hour trial and that the boilers were structurally unsound . The manufacturer agreed to replace them , but the necessary work delayed the ship 's completion by another year . She was commissioned again for a new set of sea trials on 15 November 1894 and proved reasonably satisfactory . 
 Dupuy de Lôme was finally commissioned on 15 May 1895 and was assigned to the Northern Squadron , based on the Atlantic coast . She represented France , together with the ironclad Hoche and the cruiser Surcouf , during the opening ceremony for the Kiel Canal the following month . She made port visits in Spain in June 1896 and escorted the Russian Imperial yacht into Cherbourg when Nicholas II of Russia began a state visit on 5 October . The ship escorted the President of France , Félix Faure , when he visited Russia in April 1897 . Bilge keels were fitted during a brief refit that began in October and effectively reduced the ship 's roll by half . In June 1899 , Dupuy de Lôme visited ports in Spain and Portugal and she represented France at Spithead during Queen Victoria 's funeral in January – February 1901 . 
 The ship began an extensive reconstruction in 1902 at Brest , with the installation of 20 new Guyot – du @-@ Temple water @-@ tube boilers , that took four years to complete . The boilers had an operating pressure of 11 @.@ 25 kg / cm2 ( 1 @,@ 103 kPa ; 160 psi ) and they required that a third funnel be added which necessitated extensive structural modifications . The rear military mast was replaced by a simple pole mast and sea trials in July 1906 showed that the ship could only attain 18 @.@ 27 knots ( 33 @.@ 84 km / h ; 21 @.@ 02 mph ) from 12 @,@ 887 metric horsepower ( 9 @,@ 478 kW ) . Dupuy de Lôme was placed in reserve after completing her refit in October 1906 and was not recommissioned until September 1908 for service on the Moroccan station . By this time many of the ship 's plates were rusting and her entire water distribution system had to be dismantled for cleaning in 1909 . Later that year , she was placed into reserve again and deemed uneconomical to repair . Dupuy de Lôme was decommissioned on 20 March 1910 , but the final decision to strike her from the Navy List was not made until 20 February 1911 . 
 Prompted by the rumoured purchase of the small Italian protected cruiser Umbria by Ecuador in 1910 , Peru offered to buy a French armoured cruiser . A price of three million francs was agreed upon , to be paid in three instalments , and Peru agreed to reimburse France for the costs of repairing Dupuy de Lôme . These repairs were completed by 6 March 1912 and the ship was formally transferred to the Peruvian Navy and renamed Commandante Aguirre after the first instalment was paid . After Umbria was bought by Haiti instead of Ecuador , the Peruvians lost interest in completing the purchase and the ship was left in the care of the French in October 1914 . Proposals to use her during World War I were rejected as she was thought to be too obsolete to be worth refitting . On 17 January 1917 the ship was officially returned to France and the money already paid was put against the cost to repair Commandante Aguirre . Any money in excess of the estimated 400 @,@ 000 francs that her scrapping would bring would be turned over to Peru . 
 In October 1918 , she was sold to the Belgian firm of Lloyd Royal Belge ( <unk> ) and converted to a freighter under the name Péruvier by Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde . A conventional bow was built up over her pseudo @-@ ram and the space was used to accommodate her crew . The two outboard engines , their associated boilers and propeller shafts were removed as were the two forward funnels . The ship 's side and deck armour was removed wherever it did not compromise structural strength . Péruvier was delivered in December 1919 and she began her first voyage carrying 5 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 4 @,@ 900 long tons ) of coal from Cardiff to Rio de Janeiro on 20 January 1920 . Engine repairs had to be made at Falmouth the next day and were not completed until 14 February . Her engine broke down again in the mid @-@ Atlantic and she was towed to Las Palmas by a Spanish merchantman . Arriving there on 20 March , she was towed by another <unk> ship to Pernambuco . After her arrival there on 1 June , the coal in her No. 3 hold was found to be on fire . This was not extinguished until 19 June and the ship remained in harbour until 14 October . Péruvier was towed to Antwerp , arriving on 18 November , and lay idle there until she was sold for scrap . On 4 March 1923 , she was towed to the shipbreakers in Flushing . 
 = The Kingston Trio = 
 The Kingston Trio is an American folk and pop music group that helped launch the folk revival of the late 1950s to late 1960s . The group started as a San Francisco Bay Area nightclub act with an original lineup of Dave Guard , Bob Shane , and Nick Reynolds . It rose to international popularity , fueled by unprecedented sales of 33 ⅓ rpm long @-@ playing record albums ( LPs ) , and helped to alter the direction of popular music in the U.S. 
 The Kingston Trio was one of the most prominent groups of the era 's pop @-@ folk boom that started in 1958 with the release of their first album and its hit recording of " Tom Dooley " , which sold over three million copies as a single . The Trio released nineteen albums that made Billboard 's Top 100 , fourteen of which ranked in the top 10 , and five of which hit the number 1 spot . Four of the group 's LPs charted among the 10 top @-@ selling albums for five weeks in November and December 1959 , a record unmatched for more than 50 years , and the group still ranks after half a century in the all @-@ time lists of many of Billboard 's cumulative charts , including those for most weeks with a number 1 album , most total weeks charting an album , most number 1 albums , most consecutive number 1 albums , and most top ten albums . 
 In 1961 , the Trio was described as " the most envied , the most imitated , and the most successful singing group , folk or otherwise , in all show business " and " the undisputed kings of the <unk> rage by every yardstick . " Music historian Richie Unterberger characterized their impact as " phenomenal popularity " , and the Kingston Trio 's massive record sales in its early days made acoustic folk music commercially viable , paving the way for singer @-@ songwriter , folk rock , and Americana artists who followed in their wake .

 Dave Guard and Bob Shane had been friends since junior high school at the Punahou School in Honolulu , Hawaii where both had learned to play ukulele in required music classes . They had developed an interest in and admiration for native Hawaiian slack key guitarists like Gabby <unk> . While in Punahou 's secondary school , Shane taught first himself and then Guard the rudiments of the six @-@ string guitar , and the two began performing at parties and in school shows doing an eclectic mix of Tahitian , Hawaiian , and calypso songs . 
 After graduating from high school in 1952 , Guard enrolled at Stanford University in Palo Alto , California , while Shane matriculated at nearby Menlo College . At Menlo , Shane became friends with Nick Reynolds , a native San <unk> with an extensive knowledge of folk and calypso songs — in part from his guitar @-@ playing father , a career officer in the U.S. Navy . Reynolds was also able to create and sing tenor harmonies , a skill derived in part from family singalongs , and could play both guitar and bongo and conga drums . Shane and Reynolds performed at fraternity parties and <unk> for a time , and eventually Shane introduced Reynolds to Guard . The three began performing at campus and neighborhood hangouts , sometimes as a trio but with an aggregation of friends that could swell their ranks to as many as six or seven , according to Reynolds . They usually billed themselves under the name of " Dave Guard and the <unk> " . None of the three at that time had any serious aspirations to enter professional show business , however , and Shane returned to Hawaii following his graduation in late 1956 to work in the family sporting goods business . 
 Still in the Bay Area , Guard and Reynolds had organized themselves somewhat more formally into an entity named " The Kingston Quartet " with friends bassist Joe Gannon and vocalist Barbara Bogue , though as before they were often joined in their performances by other friends . At one engagement at Redwood City 's Cracked Pot beer garden , they met a young San Francisco publicist named Frank Werber , who had heard of them from a local entertainment reporter . Werber liked the group 's raw energy but did not consider them refined enough to want to represent them as an agent or manager at that point , though he left his telephone number with Guard . Some weeks later ( and following a brief period in which Reynolds was temporarily replaced in the quartet by Don MacArthur ) , Guard and Reynolds invited Werber to a performance of the group at the Italian Village Restaurant in San Francisco , where Werber was so impressed by the group 's progress that he agreed to manage them provided they replace Gannon , in whose professional potential Werber had no faith . Bogue left with Gannon , and Guard , Reynolds , and Werber invited Shane to rejoin the now more formally organized band . Shane , who had been performing part @-@ time as a solo act at night in Honolulu , readily assented and returned to the mainland in early March 1957 . 
 The four drew up a contract as equal partners in Werber 's office in San Francisco , deciding first on the name " Kingston Trio " because it evoked , through its association with Kingston , Jamaica , the calypso music popular at the time , and second on the uniform of three @-@ quarter @-@ length sleeved vertically striped shirts that the group hoped would help their target audience of college students to identify with them . 
 = = Era of peak success , 1957 – 61 = = 
 Werber imposed a stern training regimen on Guard , Shane , and Reynolds , rehearsing them for six to eight hours a day for several months , sending them to prominent San Francisco vocal coach Judy Davis to help them learn to preserve their voices , and working on the group 's carefully prepared but apparently spontaneous banter between songs . At the same time , the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso , folk , and foreign language songs , suggested by all three of the musicians though usually arranged by Guard with some harmonies created by Reynolds . 
 The first major break for The Kingston Trio came in late June 1957 when comedian Phyllis Diller canceled a week @-@ long engagement at The Purple Onion club in San Francisco . When Werber persuaded the club 's owner to give the untested Trio a chance , Guard sent out five hundred postcards to everyone that the three musicians knew in the Bay Area and Werber plastered the city with handbills announcing the engagement . When the crowds came , the Trio had been well prepared by months of work , and they achieved such local popularity that the initial week 's engagement stretched to six months . Werber built upon this initial success , booking a national club tour in early 1958 for the Trio that included engagements at such prominent night spots as Mister Kelly 's in Chicago , the Village Vanguard in New York , Storyville in Boston , and finally a return to San Francisco and its showcase nightclub , the Hungry i , in June of that year . 
 At the same time , Werber was attempting to leverage the Trio 's popularity as a club act into a recording contract . Both Dot Records and Liberty Records expressed some interest , but each proposed to record the Trio on 45 rpm ( revolutions per minute ) singles only , whereas Werber and the Trio members both felt that 33 ⅓ rpm albums had more potential for the group 's music . Through Jimmy <unk> , agent for Bob Hope who had seen and liked the group at The Purple Onion , Werber contacted Capitol Records , which dispatched prominent producer <unk> Gilmore to San Francisco to evaluate the Trio 's commercial potential . On Gilmore 's strong recommendation , Capitol signed the Kingston Trio to an exclusive seven @-@ year deal . 
 The group 's first album , Capitol <unk> The Kingston Trio , was recorded over a three @-@ day period in February 1958 and released in June that year , just as the Trio was beginning its engagement at the Hungry i . Gilmore had made two important supervisory decisions as producer — first , to add the same kind of " bottom " to the Trio 's sound that he had heard in live performance and consequently recruiting Purple Onion house bassist Buzz Wheeler to play on the album , and second to record the group 's songs without the secondary orchestral accompaniment that was nearly universal ( even for folk @-@ styled records ) at the time . The song selections on the first album reflected the repertoire that the musicians had been working on for two years — re @-@ imagined traditional songs inspired by The Weavers like " Santy Anno " and " Bay of Mexico , " calypso @-@ flavored tunes reminiscent of the hugely popular Harry Belafonte recordings of the time such as " <unk> " and " Sloop John B " , and a mix of both foreign language and contemporary songwriter numbers , including Terry Gilkyson 's " Fast Freight " and " Scotch and Soda " , whose authorship remains unknown as of 2015 . 
 The album sold moderately well — including on @-@ site sales at the Hungry i during the Kingston Trio 's engagement there through the summer — but it was DJs Paul Colburn and Bill Terry at station <unk> in Salt Lake City whose enthusiasm for a single cut on the record spurred the next development in the group 's history . Colburn began playing " Tom Dooley " extensively on his show , prompting a rush of album sales in the Salt Lake area by fans who wanted to listen to the song , as yet unavailable as a single record . Colburn called other DJs around the country urging them to do the same , and national response to the song was so strong that a reluctant Capitol Records finally released the tune as a 45rpm single on August 8 , 1958 ; it reached the number 1 spot on the Billboard chart by late November , sold a million copies by Christmas , and was awarded a gold record on January 21 , 1959 . " Tom Dooley " also spurred the debut album to a number 1 position on the charts and helped the band earn a second gold record for the LP , which remained charted on Billboard 's weekly reports for 195 weeks . 
 The success of the album and the single earned the Kingston Trio a Grammy award for Best Country & Western Performance for " Tom Dooley " at the awards ' inaugural ceremony in 1959 . At the time , no folk music category existed in the Grammy 's scheme . The next year , largely as a result of The Kingston Trio and " Tom Dooley " , the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences instituted a folk category and the Trio won the first Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording for its second studio album At Large . 
 This was the beginning of a remarkable three @-@ year run for the Trio in which their first five studio albums achieved number 1 chart status and were awarded gold records . By 1961 , the group had sold more than eight million records , earning in excess of US $ 25 million for Capitol , roughly US $ 200 million in 2015 dollars . The Kingston Trio was responsible for 15 percent of Capitol 's total sales when Capitol also recorded among many other popular artists Frank Sinatra and Nat " King " Cole , both of whom were also producing high @-@ charting profitable albums . One indication of the Kingston Trio 's popularity during this era was that for five consecutive weeks in November and December 1959 , four Kingston Trio albums ranked in the top ten of Billboard 's Top LPs chart , an accomplishment unmatched by any artist before or since . The Trio also charted several single records during this time , made numerous television appearances , and played upwards of 200 engagements per year . 
 = = Change and a second phase , 1961 – 67 = = 
 Despite the Kingston Trio 's nearly unprecedented success in record sales , by early 1961 a rift developed and deepened between Guard on one side and Shane and Reynolds on the other . Guard had been referred to in the press and on the albums ' liner notes as the " acknowledged leader " of the group , a description never wholly endorsed by Shane and Reynolds , who felt themselves equal contributors to the group 's repertoire and success . Guard wanted Shane and Reynolds to follow his lead and learn more of the technical aspects of music and to redirect the group 's song selections , in part because of the withering criticism that the group had been getting from more traditional folk performers for the Trio 's smoother and more commercial versions of folk songs and for the money @-@ making copyrights that the Kingston group had secured for their arrangements of public domain songs . Shane and Reynolds felt that the formula for song selection and performance that they had painstakingly developed and rehearsed still served them well . 
 Furthermore , over $ 100 @,@ 000 appeared to be missing from the Trio 's publishing royalties ( an accounting error eventually rectified ) and that created an additional irritant to both sides : to Guard because he regarded it as inexcusable carelessness and to Shane and Reynolds because it highlighted what they perceived as Guard 's propensity to claim individual copyright for some of the group 's songs , including " Tom Dooley " ( though Guard eventually lost a suit over copyright for that number to Alan Lomax , Frank Warner , and Frank Proffitt ) and " Scotch and Soda " . 
 The situation became intolerable for all concerned , and Dave Guard resigned from the Kingston Trio in April 1961 , though pledging to fulfill group commitments through November of that year . Shane , Reynolds , and Werber bought out Guard 's interest in the partnership for $ 300 @,@ 000 to be paid over a number of years and moved to replace him immediately . The remaining Trio partners settled quickly on John Stewart , a 21 @-@ year @-@ old member of the Cumberland Three , one of the myriad of groups that sprang up hoping to imitate the Kingston Trio 's success . Stewart was already well @-@ acquainted with Reynolds and Shane , having sold two of his early songwriting efforts to the Trio , and he was a proficient guitarist , banjoist , and singer who seemed to the partners to be perfectly positioned to replace Guard . Stewart began rehearsing and recording with the group nearly immediately , commencing public appearances with the Trio in September 1961 . 
 According to Shane , " We did nearly as well with John as we did with Dave . " Six of the group 's next seven albums between 1961 and 1963 continued to place in Billboard 's Top Ten and several of the group 's most successful singles , including " Where Have All the Flowers Gone ? " and " Greenback Dollar " , charted as well . 
 Beginning in 1964 , however , the Kingston Trio 's dominance in record sales and in concert bookings began to wane , due partly to the number and popularity of the aforementioned imitators in the pop @-@ folk world but also to the rise of other major commercial folk groups like Peter , Paul and Mary whose music had a decidedly more political bent than the Trio 's . In addition , the British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles , who were signed by EMI / Capitol just as the Trio 's seven @-@ year contract was running out , depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly , and Capitol did not make a serious effort to re @-@ sign the group . Werber secured a generous signing bonus from Decca Records , and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio 's first decade were released by that label . Without the production facilities of Capitol , however , and the expertise of <unk> Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott , the Decca releases lacked the aural brilliance of the Capitol albums , and none of the four sold especially well . 
 By 1966 , Reynolds had grown weary of touring and Stewart wanted to strike out on his own as a singer @-@ songwriter , so the three musicians and Werber developed an exit strategy of playing as many dates as possible for a year with an endpoint determined to be a final two @-@ week engagement at the Hungry i in June 1967 . The group followed this strategy successfully , and on June 17 , 1967 , the Kingston Trio ceased to be an actively performing band . 
 = = Hiatus and the New Kingston Trio , 1967 – 1976 = = 
 Following the Hungry i engagement , Reynolds moved to Port Orford , Oregon and pursued interests in ranching , business , and race cars for the next twenty years . Stewart commenced a long and distinguished career as a singer @-@ songwriter , composing hit songs like " Daydream Believer " for The Monkees and " Runaway Train " for Rosanne Cash . He recorded more than 40 albums of his own , most notably the landmark California Bloodlines , and found chart success in the top forty with " Midnight Wind " , " Lost Her in the Sun " , and " Gold " , the latter reaching number 5 in 1979 . 
 Bob Shane decided to stay in entertainment , and he experimented with solo work . He recorded several singles , including a well @-@ received but under @-@ marketed version of the song " Honey " that later became a million @-@ seller for Bobby Goldsboro , and with different configurations with other folk @-@ oriented performers . Though finances were not an immediate concern — the Kingston Trio partners Werber , Shane and Reynolds still owned an office building , a restaurant , other commercial real estate , and a variety of other lucrative investments — Shane wanted to return to a group environment and in 1969 secured permission from his partners to use the mutually owned group name for another band , with Reynolds and Werber insisting only that Shane 's group be musically as accomplished as its predecessors and that Shane append " new " to the band 's title . 
 Shane agreed and organized two troupes under the name of " The New Kingston Trio " . The first consisted of guitarist Pat <unk> and banjoist Jim Connor in addition to Shane and lasted from 1969 to 1973 , the second including guitarist Roger Gambill and banjoist Bill Zorn from 1973 until 1976 . Shane tried to create a repertoire for these groups that included both the older and expected Kingston Trio standards like " Tom Dooley " and " <unk> " but that would also feature more contemporary songs as well , including country and novelty tunes . The attempt did not meet with any significant success . The only full @-@ length album released by either group was The World Needs a Melody in 1973 ( though 25 years later <unk> Records issued The Lost Masters 1969 – 1972 , a compilation of previously unreleased tracks from the Shane @-@ <unk> @-@ Connor years ) , and its sales were negligible . Though both troupes of the New Kingston Trio made a limited number of other recordings and several television appearances , neither generated very much interest from fans or the public at large . 
 = = The third phase , 1976 – present = = 
 In 1976 , Bill Zorn left the New Kingston Trio to work as a solo performer and record producer in London . Shane and Gambill replaced him with George Grove , a professionally trained singer and instrumentalist from North Carolina who had been working in Nashville as a studio musician . 
 The same year , Shane secured from Werber and Reynolds the unencumbered rights to use the band 's original name of the Kingston Trio without the appended " new " in exchange for relinquishing his interest in the still @-@ profitable corporation , whose holdings included copyrights and licensing rights to many of the original Trio 's songs . Since 1976 , the various troupes headed and owned by Shane have performed and recorded simply as the Kingston Trio . 
 The Shane @-@ Gambill @-@ Grove Kingston Trio existed from 1976 through 1985 , when Gambill died unexpectedly from a heart ailment at the age of 45 . The nine years of this configuration was to that point the longest period of time that any three musicians had worked together as the Kingston Trio , and the group released two albums of largely original material . 
 It was during this period as well that PBS producers JoAnne Young and Paul Surratt approached Shane and the other principals of the original group with the idea of arranging a reunion concert that would be taped and used as a fundraiser for the network . Agreement was reached , and on November 7 , 1981 , Dave Guard , Nick Reynolds , and John Stewart joined the Shane @-@ Gambill @-@ Grove Trio and guest performers Mary Travers of Peter , Paul and Mary , Tom Smothers of the Smothers Brothers , and Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac at the Magic Mountain amusement park north of Los Angeles for a show billed as " The Kingston Trio And Friends Reunion . " The different configurations of the Trio took turns performing sets of the group 's best @-@ known songs with all the artists joining onstage for a finale . 
 More than twenty years had passed since Dave Guard had left the group , but residual tension surfaced between Guard and Shane in an article in the Wall Street Journal that appeared in March 1982 following the national broadcast of the taped show . Guard implicitly disparaged Shane 's current group , and Shane asserted a distaste for performing again with Guard , who had spent the intervening decades living and performing in Australia , touring sporadically as a soloist , and writing about and teaching music . Despite the unpleasantness , Shane and Guard reconciled to a large degree ( even to the point of planning a possible reunion tour ) prior to Guard 's death at age 56 from lymphoma nine years later in March 1991 . 
 Following the 1985 death of Roger Gambill , Kingston Trio personnel changed several times , though Shane and Grove remained constants . Bob Haworth , a veteran folk performer who had worked as a member of The Brothers Four for many years , initially replaced Gambill from 1985 through 1988 and again from 1999 through 2005 . In 1988 , original member Nick Reynolds rejoined the band until his final retirement in 1999 . When heart disease forced Bob Shane 's retirement from touring in March 2004 , he was replaced by former New Kingston Trio member Bill Zorn . A year later , following Haworth 's departure , Grove and Zorn were joined by Rick Dougherty , who had performed for a time with Zorn as second @-@ generation members of another popular folk group from the 1960s , The Limeliters . 
 Both the Grove – Zorn – Haworth and Grove – Zorn – Dougherty troupes of the Kingston Trio have released original CDs and DVDs , and the latter configuration continues to tour extensively under the direction of the only surviving original member Bob Shane , now sole owner of the band . Capitol Records , Decca Records , Collector 's Choice Music , and Folk Era Records have released and continue to release compilations of older albums as well as previously unreleased tapes of both studio and live recordings from the Kingston Trio 's first ten years .

 = = = Initial criticism = = = 
 Almost from its inception , the Kingston Trio found itself at odds with the traditional music community . Urban folk musicians of the time ( to whom Bob Dylan referred in Rolling Stone as " the left @-@ wing puritans that seemed to have a hold on the folk @-@ music community " ) frequently associated folk music with leftist politics and were contemptuous of the Trio 's deliberate political neutrality . Peter Dreier of Occidental College observed that " Purists often derided the Kingston Trio for watering down folk songs in order to make them commercially popular and for remaining on the political sidelines during the protest movements of the 1960s . " A series of scathing articles appeared over several years in Sing Out ! magazine , a publication that combined articles on traditional folk music with political activism . Its editor Irwin Silber referred to " the sallow slickness of the Kingston Trio " and in an article in the spring 1959 issue Ron Radosh said that the Trio brought " good folk music to the level of the worst in Tin Pan Alley music " and referred to them as " prostitutes of the art who gain their status as folk artists because they use guitars and banjos . " Following the Trio 's performance at the premier Newport Folk Festival in 1959 , folk music critic Mark Morris wrote : " What connection these frenetic <unk> showmen have with a folk festival eludes me ... except that it is mainly folk songs that they choose to <unk> . " 
 Frank Proffitt , the Appalachian musician whose version of " Tom Dooley " the Trio rearranged , watched their performance of his song on a television show and wrote in reaction , " They <unk> and <unk> . Then they came out with ' This time tomorrow , reckon where I ’ ll be / If it hadn 't a ' been for Grayson / I 'd a been in Tennessee . ' I began to feel <unk> sick . Like I ’ d lost a loved one . Tears came to my eyes . I went out and bawled on the ridge . " Proffitt had learned the song from his father and his grandmother , who had known Tom Dula and Laura Foster , the killer and the victim in the actual 1866 murder related in the song . Both Proffitt and fellow North Carolina musician Doc Watson sang the older version of the tune , which had " a lively mocking tempo ... that retained some of the <unk> and moral squalor of an actual murder , " according to folk historian Robert Cantwell , who also notes that the Kingston Trio 's version of the song left out several verses from the traditional lyric . The slower , harmonized Trio version of the Dooley song and other traditional numbers struck Proffitt as a betrayal of " the strange mysterious workings which has made Tom Dooly [ sic ] live ... " As recently as 2006 , folk traditionalist and influential banjo master Billy <unk> remarked : " I hear and see very little respect for the folk genre " in their music and described the Trio 's repertoire as " a mishmash of twisted arrangements that not only obscure the true beauty of the folk songs from which they derive , but give them a meaning they never had . " 
 However , Trio members never claimed to be folksingers and were never comfortable with the label . The liner notes for the group 's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that " We are not folksingers in the accepted sense of the word . " Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine : " We are not students of folk music ; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in . " Nick Reynolds added in the same article : " We don 't collect old songs in the sense that the academic cats do ... We get new tunes to look over every day . Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that 's good . " Bob Shane remarked years later : " To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place . We never called ourselves folksingers ... We did folk @-@ oriented material , but we did it amid all kinds of other stuff . But they didn 't know what to call us with our instruments , so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom . " 
 = = = 21st @-@ century perspectives = = = 
 Over the years , the Kingston Trio expanded its song selection beyond the rearranged traditional numbers , calypso songs , and Broadway show tunes that had appeared on its first several albums . In an obituary for Nick Reynolds ( d . October 1 , 2008 ) , Spencer Leigh wrote in Britain 's Sunday Independent : 
 Looking at their repertoire now , it is apparent that the Kingston Trio was far more adventurous than is generally supposed . They introduced " It Was A Very Good Year " in 1961 , later a standard for Frank Sinatra , and they were one of the first to spot the potential of English language versions of Jacques Brel 's songs by recording " Seasons in the Sun " in 1963 . They encouraged young songwriters including Hoyt Axton ( " Greenback Dollar " ) , Rod <unk> ( " Ally Ally Oxen Free " , " The World I Used to Know " ) and Billy Edd Wheeler ( " Reverend Mr Black " ) . Best of all , in 1962 they introduced listeners to one of the most poignant songs ever written , the anti @-@ war ballad " Where Have All The Flowers Gone ? " by Pete Seeger , formerly with the Weavers . 
 Further , Peter Dreier points out that " the group deserves credit for helping to launch the folk boom that brought recognition to older <unk> and radicals like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger , and for paving the way for newcomers like Joan Baez , Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs , who were well known for their progressive political views and topical songs . By the time these younger folk singers arrived on the scene , the political climate had changed enough to provide a wide audience for protest music . " The passage of time may well have made the controversy moot . Writing in the British daily The Guardian , again in an obituary for Reynolds , Ken Hunt asserted that " [ the Kingston Trio ] helped to turn untold numbers of people on to folk music ... [ T ] hey put the boom in folk boom . The Kingston Trio carried the torch overseas , most notably with their international hit of 1958 , Tom Dooley . They were the greatest of the bands to emerge after the McCarthy @-@ era blacklisting of folk musicians and breathed new air into the genre . "

 The Kingston Trio 's influence on the development of American popular music has been considerable . According to music critic Bruce Eder writing for <unk> : 
 In the history of popular music , there are a relative handful of performers who have redefined the content of the music at critical points in history — people whose music left the landscape , and definition of popular music , altered completely . The Kingston Trio were one such group , transforming folk music into a hot commodity and creating a demand — where none had existed before — for young men ( sometimes with women ) strumming acoustic guitars and banjos and singing folk songs and folk @-@ like novelty songs in harmony . On a purely commercial level , from 1957 until 1963 , the Kingston Trio were the most vital and popular folk group in the world , and folk music was sufficiently popular as to make that a significant statement . Equally important , the original trio — Dave Guard , Nick Reynolds , and Bob Shane — in tandem with other , similar early acts such as the Limeliters , spearheaded a boom in the popularity of folk music that suddenly made the latter important to millions of listeners who previously had ignored it . 
 Discussing his earliest musical influences in a 2001 Rolling Stone interview , Bob Dylan remembered : 
 There were other folk @-@ music records , commercial folk @-@ music records , like those by the Kingston Trio . I never really was an elitist . Personally , I liked the Kingston Trio . I could see the picture ... the Kingston Trio were probably the best commercial group going , and they seemed to know what they were doing . 
 In his autobiography Chronicles , Dylan added : " I liked The Kingston Trio . Even though their style was polished and collegiate , I liked most of their stuff anyway . " 
 In February of 1982 , Chicago Tribune writer Eric Zorn praised the Kingston Trio 's impact on the popular music industry , claiming that " for almost five years , they overshadowed all other pop groups in America . " He also noted that " five of their first six albums hit No. 1 on the charts , " and that they " so changed the course of popular music that their impact is largely felt to this day . " 
 Jac Holzman , co @-@ founder of the originally folk @-@ based Elektra Records , remarked that his formerly struggling company 's new @-@ found prosperity in the late 1950s resulted from " The Kingston Trio which has the ability to capture the interest of a large number of people who have never been conscious of folk music before . In this respect , the Kingston Trio has put us on the map . " Even some staunch traditionalists from both the urban and rural folk music communities had an affinity for the Kingstons ' polished commercial versions of older songs . In her memoir And A Voice To Sing With , singer and activist Joan Baez recalled that " Traveling across the country with my mother and sisters , we heard the commercial songs of the budding folk boom for the first time , the Kingston Trio 's ' Tom Dooley ' and ' Scotch and Soda . ' Before I turned into a snob and learned to look down upon all commercial folk music as bastardized and unholy , I loved the Kingston Trio . When I became one of the leading practitioners of ' pure folk , ' I still loved them ... " <unk> " Doc " Watson of North Carolina , one of the most respected and influential musicians performing traditional music , remarked , " I ’ ll tell you who pointed all our noses in the right direction , even the traditional performers . They got us interested in trying to put the good stuff out there — the Kingston Trio . They got me interested in it ! "

 The C.F. Martin & Company guitar manufacturers has attributed the dramatic rise in demand for its instruments in the early 1960s in large part to the Kingston Trio 's use of their guitars , featured prominently and without compensation on nearly all of their album covers . A Martin company press release in 2007 announcing a fourth Kingston Trio commemorative model guitar stated that 
 ... The Kingston Trio changed everything about popular music — and the entire acoustic guitar industry along with it ... It was the rise of The Kingston Trio that really established Martin as " America 's Guitar " ... The Kingston Trio wasn 't just a musical group . It was a phenomenon , as influential in its time as The Beatles would become in theirs . 
 Satirist Tom Lehrer has acknowledged the Trio 's pioneering of college concerts , observing that before the Kingstons " there was no real concert circuit ... The Kingston Trio started all that , " and in Time magazine , critic Richard Corliss asserted , " In my youth , they changed pop music , and me with it . "

 = Speed Racer ( film ) = 
 Speed Racer is a 2008 American sports action @-@ comedy film based on the Japanese anime and manga series of the same name by Tatsunoko Productions . The film was written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers , [ n 1 ] and stars Emile Hirsch , Christina Ricci , John Goodman , Susan Sarandon , Matthew Fox , Benno <unk> , Hiroyuki Sanada , Rain and Richard Roundtree . The plot revolves around Speed Racer , an 18 @-@ year @-@ old automobile racer who follows his apparently deceased brother 's career . His choice to remain loyal to his family and their company Racer Motors causes difficulties after he refuses a contract offered by E.P. Arnold Royalton , the owner of Royalton Industries . 
 The film had been in development since 1992 , changing actors , writers and directors until 2006 , when producer Joel Silver and the Wachowskis collaborated to begin production on Speed Racer as a family film . Speed Racer was shot between early June and late August 2007 in and around Potsdam and Berlin , at an estimated budget of $ 120 million . The film score was composed by Michael Giacchino , and the film 's soundtrack , which contains the sound effects and theme song from the original series , was released on May 6 , 2008 . 
 Speed Racer premiered on April 26 , 2008 at the Nokia Theater , and was released in regular theaters in North America on May 9 , 2008 . Although it grossed over $ 93 million , it was considered a box office bomb due to its production cost . It was subsequently nominated in multiple categories at the Teen Choice Awards , and was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Awards . The film was criticized for its storyline , characters and dialogue but received praise for its capacity to entertain the target audience and the performance of its cast . Speed Racer also divided critics over its use of special effects . The film received mostly negative reviews by the time of its release . Years later , however , commentators called it a cult and underrated film . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Speed Racer is an 18 @-@ year @-@ old whose life and love has always been automobile racing . His parents Pops and Mom run the independent Racer Motors , in which his brother Spritle , mechanic Sparky , and girlfriend Trixie are also involved . As a child Speed idolized his record @-@ setting older brother , Rex Racer , who was killed while racing in the Casa Cristo 5000 , a deadly cross @-@ country racing rally . Now embarking on his own career , Speed Racer is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill behind the wheel of his brother 's cars , the Mach 5 and his own Formula One car the Mach 6 , but remains primarily interested in the art of the race and the well @-@ being of his family . 
 E.P. Arnold Royalton , owner of conglomerate Royalton Industries , offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle in exchange for signing to race with him . Speed is tempted but declines due to his father 's distrust of power @-@ hungry corporations . Angered , Royalton reveals that for many years the key races have been fixed by corporate interests , including Royalton himself , to gain profits . Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for intellectual property infringement . Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector , head of a corporate crimes division . Racer Taejo Togokahn says that he has evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked Racer X agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000 . Taejo says that a win could substantially raise the stock price of his family 's racing business , blocking a Royalton @-@ arranged buyout . Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family , and Inspector Detector 's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally . 
 After they drive together and work naturally as a team , Speed begins to suspect that Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise . His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him . With the help of his family and Trixie , Speed defeats many brutal racers who have been bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him , and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race . However , Taejo 's arrangement is revealed to be a sham , as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family 's company so that they could profit from Royalton 's buyout . An angry Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother , and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex . Racer X removes his mask , revealing an unfamiliar face , and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead . Speed returns home , where Taejo 's sister Horuko Togokahn gives him Taejo 's automatic invitation to the Grand Prix , which Taejo had rejected . The Racer family bands together and builds the new Mach 6 in 32 hours . 
 Speed enters the Grand Prix against great odds : Royalton has placed a bounty on his head that the other drivers are eager to collect , and he is pitted against future Hall of Fame driver Jack " Cannonball " Taylor . Speed overcomes a slow start to catch up with Taylor , who uses a cheating device called a <unk> to latch the Mach 6 to his own car . Speed uses his jump jacks to expose the device to video cameras , causing Taylor to crash . Speed wins the race , having successfully exposed Royalton 's crimes . While Racer X watches it is revealed in a flashback montage that he really is Rex , who has faked his death and undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance as part of his plan to save his family and the sport of racing . He chooses not to reveal his identity to his family , declaring that he must live with his decision . The Racer family celebrates Speed 's victory as Speed and Trixie kiss , and Royalton is sent to jail .

In June 1995 , Johnny Depp was cast into the lead role for Speed Racer , with production slated to begin the coming October , with filming to take place in California and Arizona . The following August , Depp requested time off to the studio for personal business , delaying production . However , due to an overly high budget , the same August , director Julien Temple left the project . Depp , without a director , also departed from the project . The studio considered director Gus Van Sant as a replacement for Temple , though it would not grant writing privileges to Van Sant . In December 1997 , the studio briefly hired Alfonso Cuarón as director . In the various incarnations of the project , screenwriters Marc Levin , Jennifer <unk> , J. J. Abrams , and Patrick Read Johnson had been hired to write scripts . 
 In September 2000 , Warner Bros. and producer Lauren Shuler Donner hired writer @-@ director Hype Williams to take the helm of the project .

Visual effects designer John Gaeta , who won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for the Wachowskis ' The Matrix , was brought in to help conceive making Speed Racer into a live @-@ action adaptation . Production was set to begin in summer 2007 in European locations for a summer 2008 release . In November 2006 , the release date for it was set for May 23 , 2008 .

The AHA representative also reported that " toward the end of filming , during a training session in the presence of the American Humane Representative , the trainer , in an uncontrolled impulse , hit the chimpanzee . " The AHA Film Unit referred to this abuse as " completely inexcusable and unacceptable behavior in the use of any animal . " The AHA has rated Speed Racer " <unk> " chiefly because of this incident , with AHA noting " the aforementioned training incident tarnishes the excellent work of the rest of production " and that it " has no method of separating the actions of one individual in the employ of a production from the production as a whole .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes ranked Speed Racer as " rotten " , with 39 % of its selected critics giving the film positive reviews , based on 208 reviews with an average rating of 5 @.@ 1 / 10 . The website 's consensus reads , " [ The Wachowskis ] have overloaded Speed Racer with headache @-@ inducing special effects , and neglected to develop a coherent storyline . " At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film has received an average score of 37 out of 100 , which indicates " generally unfavorable reviews " , based on 37 reviews . 
 Writing for The Hollywood Reporter , Kirk Honeycutt called Speed Racer 's visual effects " stellar " , but stated it " proudly denies entry into its ultra @-@ bright world to all but gamers , fanboys and anime enthusiasts " . He criticized that story and character were " tossed aside " towards the " wearying " races . Todd McCarthy of Variety noted the target audience should be amused , but others might think the film " a cinematic pile @-@ up " , citing its implausibility and the lack of identifiable peril in the driving sequences . While noted viewers interested in CGI would appreciate it , McCarthy said the frame sometimes resembled " a kindergartner 's art class collage " . He had praise for the cinematography , the musical score , and the cast . Anime News Network 's Zac Bertschy also praised the cast , while saying the story is " as anyone would expect " , adding " the characters are all cardboard archetypes with Saturday Morning dialogue . " Speed Racer " sets out to honor and refresh a youthful enthusiasm from the past and winds up smothering the fun in self @-@ conscious grandiosity " , declared The New York Times 's A. O. Scott . 
 Glenn Kenny of Premiere criticized the film 's time @-@ shifting narrative and multiple storylines , saying it " yields heretofore <unk> of levels of narrative incoherence " . Kenny praised the film 's look , saying the " <unk> @-@ <unk> " that others had criticised was " precisely the point " . He remarked the movie inspires even more thinking than The Matrix because of its " blatantly anti @-@ capitalist storylines " . Similarly , The New Yorker 's Anthony Lane said the film could still end up " bleached of fun " due to the theme mooted in The Matrix that all of us are being controlled . In Speed Racer , Lane argues , this comes in the form of villain Royalton , who " vows to crush [ Speed ] with ' the unassailable might of money . ' " He concluded some people may call it entertaining , but he " felt [ it ] like Pop fascism " . Jim Emerson , editor at the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , wrote that Speed Racer " is a manufactured widget , a packaged commodity that capitalizes on an anthropomorphized cartoon of Capitalist Evil in order to sell itself and its ancillary products " . It was said to be " the most tiresome piece of CGI ( Computer Generated Idiocy [ sic ] ) " of the " past couple of years " at the time of film 's release by Philip French , a The Guardian critic . 
 Conversely , IGN 's Todd Gilchrist gave a positive review , stating that Speed Racer " is not merely the best film that it could be , it 's pretty much exactly what it should be : full of exciting , brilliantly @-@ conceived races , primary @-@ color characterizations and an irresistible sense of fun " . He called Speed Racer " a masterpiece of its kind " , praising " the special effects extravaganza " and " the moment when the Wachowskis went from wunderkind directors to true auteurs " . Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune described Speed Racer as " buoyant pop entertainment and noted the Wachowskis respected " the themes of honor , dishonor , family loyalty and Visigoth @-@ inspired barbarism behind the wheel " of the original work . The cast is praised as being " earnest " and " gently playful " . However , he stated that " it sags in its midsection " with unnecessary dialogue . Although it was said to be among the worst films of the year by Rebecca Murray of About.com , she included Speed Racer on her list of " Top 10 Action Movies of 2008 " , stating " the action sequences are definitely eye @-@ catching . " Time magazine included Speed Racer on its list of " The All @-@ Time 25 Best Sports Movies " and " Top 10 Movies of 2008 " . It said " Not every avant @-@ garde FX masterpiece receives instant audience validation " , described the film as " a rich , cartoonish dream : non @-@ stop Op art , and a triumph of virtual virtuosity . " 
 However , in later years , the film has appeared periodically on lists of underrated films or cult films . Speed Racer was elected the third most underrated film of the 2000s by Den of Geek 's <unk> Horton , which called it " a game @-@ changing film which redefined and <unk> the film form as we know it . " Nick Hyman , writing for Metacritic , included the film on its list of " movies that critics got wrong " calling it " a cult classic in the making " . It was described as " nearly unmatched [ ... ] insofar as action / adventure / family films go " by Alejandro <unk> from JoBlo.com , while Slate 's Chris Wade named it " an underrated masterpiece , " stating " they [ the Wachowskis ] made a brilliant visual cartoon that dares to ask that you take it seriously . " Annalee Newitz of io9 analyzed the ten reasons why she believes the film to be an " unsung masterpiece " ; among them , the visuals , the humor , and even its political themes . Tor.com 's Dexter Palmer considered the possibility that the film is a " misunderstood art film " , highlighting its color scheme that is a " pleasure " and the fact it does not try to seem real . Palmer lauded it because he does not think films must imitate reality , and ultimately said it is " an extreme reminder of what films , and especially fantasy and science fiction films , can place on screen " and that it is " a refreshing change of pace " in film industry .

 In rural Georgia , former Sheriff deputy Rick Grimes ( Andrew Lincoln ) stops his vehicle near an abandoned and ransacked convenience store in search of gasoline . He spots a little girl walking around and attempts to help her , but she turns around , revealing herself to be a zombie . The child charges at Rick , forcing him to shoot her . 
 Weeks earlier , before the apocalypse , Rick , along with his long @-@ time partner and childhood friend Shane Walsh ( Jon Bernthal ) , are called to a high speed pursuit . After the car crashes during the chase , two men emerge from the wreck and are shot dead on the scene . Rick is shot in the abdomen but recovers quickly due to his bulletproof vest . A third man then emerges from the vehicle and shoots Rick in the upper back while he talks to Shane , leaving him seriously wounded and in a coma . 
 Rick eventually regains consciousness in a seemingly abandoned hospital . In a nearby park he encounters a severely deteriorated zombie with nothing left of her lower body but trailing bones and organs . Shaken , he returns to his home to look for his family . Unable to find any sign of them , he sits outside and is suddenly hit in the head with a shovel by a young man — Duane Jones ( Adrian Kali Turner ) — who initially mistakes him for a zombie but is stopped by his father , Morgan Jones ( Lennie James ) . 
 After deciding Rick is not a threat , Morgan frees him and shares what information he has regarding the zombie apocalypse ( and the zombies , which are formally known as " walkers " ) . When Morgan and Duane tell Rick about a refugee center in Atlanta , Rick decides to head there , but Morgan and Duane choose to stay behind . Rick gives Morgan a rifle and a walkie @-@ talkie from the police station and promises to broadcast every morning at dawn to check @-@ in with him . Before he leaves , Rick finds fellow police officer Leon Basset ( <unk> Edwards ) — now a zombie — and shoots him in the head to destroy the brain which is how he 's been told is the only way to permanently kill the zombies . Rick and Morgan then part ways from the Police Station . Rick goes on his journey to see if his family is still alive out there somewhere , and Morgan goes back to the house to maintain his and his sons safety . Upon returning to the house , Morgan goes to the top floor of his house , where he looks through old family photos before shooting several zombies . As he hoped , the noise attracts more walkers , including his dead wife , but Morgan finds himself unable to shoot her and breaks down in tears . In the mean time , Rick goes back to the park where the " Bicycle Girl " was once he exited the hospital , but she has seemingly crawled away . Rick walks through the park to find her , and upon walking to her , and kneels down and says " I 'm sorry this happened to you . " He then draws his gun , points , and pulls the trigger . Rick finds this hard to do , as he still hasn 't grasped the fact that the world he knew is completely gone , and that the world is run by the dead now . After putting her out of her misery , he stands up , and leaves the park . 
 En route to Atlanta , Rick sends out a broadcast via his radio . The transmissions are received by a camp located just outside the city , but due to the bad signal , they lose contact quickly and are unable to warn him of the situation in the city . Among the campers are : Rick 's partner Shane , his wife Lori ( Sarah Wayne Callies ) , and his son Carl ( Chandler Riggs ) . Rick 's police cruiser later runs out of gas . Unable to find gas , he abandons his car and continues on foot ( this is about where the very beginning flashback took place ) . He approaches a farmhouse , where the occupants died in an apparent suicide . Rick finds a horse , which is still alive and well , nearby and rides it to Atlanta , carrying a sack of guns from the police armory . 
 Rick arrives in Atlanta and finds the city looking like an abandoned war @-@ zone . He searches the streets on horseback , finding a demolished military blockade . Rick hears a helicopter pass overhead and tries to follow it , but rides straight into a horde of walkers . The undead swarm Rick 's horse , toppling Rick and making him drop the sack of guns . While many of the zombies swarm around the horse , tearing it apart and eating it , Rick scrambles underneath an abandoned tank . With zombies crawling after him on both sides , Rick shoots several of them , then places the gun to his temple . Looking up , he sees an open hatch underneath the tank and crawls inside . The walkers surround the tank as Rick seals himself inside . Inside , Rick has to shoot an undead tank crewman ( Samuel Witwer ) , but the echo of the shot <unk> Rick . After opening the top hatch to let the sound escape , he re @-@ seals the hatch , locking himself safely inside . A voice comes over the radio , sarcastically saying : " Hey you . Dumbass . Yeah , you in the tank . Cozy in there ? " The episode ends with an overshot of zombies swarming around the tank and the fallen horse .

 Robert Kirkman claimed that he had considered the idea of a television series , but never actively pursued it . When Darabont became interested , Kirkman called it " extremely flattering " and went on to say that " he definitely cares about the original source material , and you can tell that in the way he 's adapting it . " In his interview , Kirkman exclaimed that it was " an extreme validation of the work " , and continued by expressing that " never in a million years could [ he ] have thought that if Walking Dead were to ever be adapted that everything would be going this well . " 
 The Walking Dead institutes elements from George A. Romero 's horror film Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 ) . Darabont admitted to becoming a fan of the film at age fourteen . He insisted that the film has a " weird vibe " , comparing it to that of pornography . He continued : " It had this marvelously attractive , disreputable draw [ ... ] I loved it immediately . " Darabont recalled walking into a comic book store in Burbank , California and seeing The Walking Dead on the shelf in 2005 . 
 Darabont described the process of developing the series and setting it up at a network as " four years of frustration " . He first initiated a deal with NBC to own copyrights to The Walking Dead , but was later declined . " They were very excited about the idea of doing a zombie show until I handed them a zombie script where zombies were actually doing zombie shit , " he stated . Darabont credited Hurd with finally getting the series on AMC . " Gale was tremendously instrumental in jump @-@ starting it at a point where it felt like it was languishing , " he asserted . " I 'd gotten turned down enough times , which is no reflection on the material , but no matter what you 're trying to sell in Hollywood , you 're Willy Loman and it 's Death of a Salesman . You 're out there trying to sell shit that nobody wants . Even if it 's good shit . " 
 Hurd recalled that she had heard of the comic before , and upon reading it , felt that it would be great for film . She stated : " When I first read the book , I thought , ' This would be a great film , ' and boy was I wrong . It 's a much better TV series . Fast forward , I knew that Frank had initially developed it for NBC , which to me seemed like an odd pairing for this . Then I heard it wasn 't going forward at NBC so I talked to Frank . " On January 20 , 2010 , AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot with Darabont and Hurd acting as executive producers ; the former wrote the script and directed the episode . The entire series was pre @-@ ordered based on the strength of the source material , the television scripts , and Darabont 's involvement . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Darabont wrote a 60 @-@ page pilot script for " Days Gone Bye " . His initial script for the episode was split in half and embellished . Darabont explained that he did this to " slow the narrative down and dig into the characters more deeply , so it 's not just plot @-@ driven , event @-@ driven stuff . You really want to drag these characters into the equation . " Darabont felt that instituting visual maneuvers would increase the surreal atmosphere of a scene . Upon reading the script , Kirkman thought that producers were consistent with his comic , adding that they could possibly improve his initial work . " Reading that pilot was just a revelation . It 's extremely faithful . There are things that are so much like the comic , I can 't really remember the nuance of what 's different and what 's not from the comic . He 's definitely being more faithful than I expected , and everything that he 's changing is brilliant . I couldn 't be happier . I think the fans of the book are going to just love it . " The episode shares its name with volume one of the comic book series .

 The principal photography produced a high demand for extras as zombies . In an interview with MTV News , special effects artist Greg Nicotero stated that while anyone was welcome to audition , the producers of the show were looking specifically for people who possessed exceptional height and thin features . Casting for extras took approximately three days . Once accepted , the extras would be sent to " zombie school " for training and preparing for filming . Nicotero stated that " it was interesting because I initially thought my experience with zombie movies is you just let them do whatever they want to do . George [ Romero ] always said , ' You show 50 people one movement , then you have 50 people doing all the same thing . ' So we sort of just lined them up and said , ' Let 's see what your zombie walk would look like , ' and then they would do it and we would say , ' Try this or try that . ' You know , sort of fine tuning everybody . " Alongside with Darabont , Nicotero had previously collaborated with Romero on several occasions , and looked at the structure of the zombies in his films for inspiration . " It 's not that I 'm against [ fast zombies ] . It 's just not what I grew up with . It 's interesting , too , because a couple takes we did , where a couple of the zombies kind of broke into a run , and after one take Frank 's like , ' Did they run too fast ? They shouldn 't be running . Slow them down . ' This is trying to be creepy and moody and , you know , you 're building up all this kind of scary tension . " 
 In April 2010 , The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Jon Bernthal and Andrew Lincoln were chosen by producers for the main cast of the series . Bernthal was to portray Shane Walsh , while Lincoln provided the role of Rick Grimes , the central character of The Walking Dead . While Hurd didn 't expect to cast Lincoln , Kirkman was ecstatic with his acting , evaluating him as an " amazing find " . In his interview with Dread Central , Kirkman added that " writing Rick Grimes month after month in the comic series , I had no idea he was an actual living , breathing human being , and yet , here he is . I couldn 't be more thrilled with how this show is coming together . " Although he was initially shocked upon hearing of The Walking Dead , Lincoln thought the episode 's script was well @-@ written . " I read it and thought it was well written , and I put myself on tape just for one scene . I didn 't know who was involved at this point . " The succeeding day , his agent called him about the development of the pilot . Lincoln described the moment as " kind of like a dream list " . He later communicated with Darabont via Skype ; " We spoke for about 40 minutes about his ideas for the project , about what I liked about Episode One and then he asked would I fly over to come and test . " Lincoln flew to Darabont 's home , where he viewed " Days Gone Bye " in his garage . He opined that was " brilliant " and " very intimate " . 
 Bernthal was extremely comfortable with his character on set . " The second he opened his mouth and started reading the scene , I knew it was him , " he said . " There was no question . I saw Frank and I knew it . He 's the guy . He 's a wonderful actor , and he 's going to kill it in this role . " Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead . He reminisced that he reacted so " organically " to the script that he " didn 't want to be colored by anything else . When I did read the comic , I was shocked . Look , I 'm not going to sit here and regret . One of the great things about doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself , to not let where you 're going color where you are . " The pilot episode 's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through ; He felt that this script overshadowed the others . " [ It was ] pilot season , and I read everything that was out there . I still remember the day that I got this script . I told my agent that I 'd be thrilled to be an extra in this , it 's so good . It just blew the rest of them right out of the water . " 
 Shortly after the announcement , Sarah Wayne Callies was approached to play the role of Rick 's wife Lori Grimes , the lead female . The following month , Laurie Holden claimed the role of Andrea ; Holden had previously worked with Darabont in the science @-@ fiction horror film The Mist ( 2007 ) . Other actors garnering roles in the main cast include Steven Yeun , Chandler Riggs , and Jeffrey DeMunn . " Days Gone Bye " featured guest appearances from actors and actresses such as Emma Bell ( Amy ) , Andrea 's younger sister . Bell would later become part of the main cast as a recurring character . Lennie James played Morgan , and Jim Coleman guest performed Lam Kendal . Samuel Witwer , who had collaborated with Darabont in The Mist ( 2007 ) , appeared as a dying soldier .

 The producers chose to film in Atlanta because of its proximity to <unk> , Kentucky , Kirkman 's hometown and the setting of the his comic 's first issue . " At the beginning they talk about how some of the people in neighboring states would have gone to larger cities so they could fortify them and protect the population . " Kirkman had considered other cities , particularly New York City , Miami , and Chicago . Hurd had previously filmed in the city for Lifetime . Darabont felt that Atlanta offered the essentials ; " Atlanta and Georgia all @-@ told is proving to be brilliant for us in terms of what it has to offer , in terms of what the story needed , in terms of the variety of locations — it really is a fantastic place to shoot . " Prior to filming , Kirkman toured with Darabont around the central business district . He stated , " I tagged along on a location @-@ scouting expedition , and that was pretty fun — watching Frank Darabont walking through the streets of Atlanta as if he owned the entire city , daring cars to hit him . That was a lot of fun . " Darabont ventured onto the middle of a street to grasp a perfect shot , oblivious to oncoming traffic . 
 Atlanta 's climate was cited as a potential issue that would hinder production . Darabont recalled that he found it difficult to adjust to the sweltering heat , adding that he " never had clothes stick to me like this in my life " . Lincoln retorted that it was " becoming a running joke that people arrive on set ready for the day and then they are battered and beaten up by the weather . " Despite such assertions , he opined that it added to the episode 's overall emotion . " There 's a lot of hard @-@ earned sweat on camera . It 's not comfortable and it 's not pleasant , but it 's as you would imagine it would be trying to survive in this world . " 
 Principal photography took place in the city on May 15 , 2010 , after AMC had officially ordered the production of six episodes for the series . Filming took place over two months , ending in early July . Locations were set up in various spots within the central business district , particularly in the Fairlie @-@ Poplar District . The season premiere was shot completely in anamorphic format on 16 mm film . David Tattersall was the director of photography , while production design was headed by Greg Melton and Alex Hajdu . The special effects team included veteran makeup designer Gregory Nicotero , special effects coordinator Darrell Pritchett , and visual effects supervisors Sam Nicholson and Jason Sperling . 
 Computer @-@ generated imagery was used in much of " Days Gone Bye " , particularly when Rick encounters a legless walker . " The woman was wearing basically blue stockings and then everything was cleaned out . There is an alarming amount of CGI in the pilot episode and in the whole show , and you would never know it , " articulated Robert Kirkman . Kirkman felt that Stargate Studios , which was chosen by producers to edit the pilot episode , did a splendid job . He stated : " There 's a shot where Rick is riding off on the horse and his hat actually blew off , and they really liked that shot , and so they had Stargate go in and digitally put the hat back on his head . "

 The show 's website released a motion comic based on the first issue of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr . The site also posted a making @-@ of documentary , and other behind @-@ the @-@ scenes videos and interviews . In the documentary , Kirkman as well as artist Charlie Adlard expressed pleasure that the show is faithful to the comic and remark on the similarities between the actors and the comic 's original character drawings . Several scenes were screened July 23 , 2010 as part of the 2010 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International . Hurd asserted that " [ they ] really are doing six one @-@ hour movies " , and Darabont insisted that the series would closely reflect the development in the comics . " The path is a very strong template . But we 're going to take every interesting detour we feel like taking . As long as were staying on the path of what Robert has done , I don 't see any reason not to . If they have patience we 'll eventually catch up to what Robert is doing . " 
 The Walking Dead debuted during the same week in 120 countries . " Days Gone Bye " premiered in Hong Kong on TVB Pearl on August 30 , 2011 , while it expanded in international markets during the first week of November . Two weeks prior to its official US premiere , the contents of the episode leaked online . As part of an expansive campaign to advertise and heighten anticipation for the premiere , international broadcasting affiliates of AMC and Fox coordinated a worldwide zombie invasion event days prior to the US premiere . The event occurred in twenty six cities worldwide , in select locations including the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City , Lincoln Memorial in Washington , D.C. , Palace of Westminster in London , Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul , Acropolis of Athens in Athens , and the Museo del Prado in Madrid . The campaign events commenced in Hong Kong and Taipei , and culminated in Los Angeles .

 Romance is an underlying theme in " Days Gone Bye " . After returning from the hospital , Grimes unsuccessfully looks for signs of his family . Determined to find them , he travels to Atlanta , which is imagined to be a haven because of its proximity to the CDC . Kirkman said of the developing storyline : 
 Well , I didn ’ t know how long the comic book series was going to last . I hoped that it would become a success and survive for years and years . But at that time in my career , it was very early , I had had a lot of books canceled , just because of poor sales . So early on in the book I would move past storylines very quickly . I set up this love triangle and I resolved that story and moved along within the first [ few ] issues . But there 's a lot of story potential to mine there . One of the things that the TV show is able to do is to look at the comic book series with hindsight and go , ' This would probably be something that we could explore more . ' And that 's what we 're going to be doing . So we 'll be seeing a lot more of the Lori @-@ Shane @-@ Rick love triangle . 
 The scene in which Grimes regains consciousness and investigates his situation is reminiscent of the British horror films The Day of the Triffids ( 1962 ) and 28 Days Later ( 2002 ) . Kirkman insisted that the similarities especially with 28 Days Later was coincidental . " I saw 28 Days Later shortly before the first issue of Walking Dead was released , " he stated . " That first issue came out in October of 2003 and 28 Days Later was released in the States in June of 2003 . So we were working on our second issue by the time I saw it . It was going to be a matter of somehow trying to <unk> the entire first issue , because it was a very similar coma opening . I made a decision — which I pretty much regret at this point — I said , ' You know what ? It 's so different [ from that point on ] , I will probably never hear anything about this . ' And I was wrong . "

" Senior Vice President Joel <unk> ascribed that much of its success came from the storytelling presented in the episode ; " The Walking Dead is that rare piece of programming that works on so many levels . It is legitimately great storytelling that is not only highly entertaining , but incredibly thought provoking as well .

 " Days Gone Bye " was critically acclaimed . Sebastian Liver of Der Tagesspiegel insisted that the episode was setting new standards , and elaborated that it illuminates even during its timid moments . Mike Ryan of Vanity Fair reflected parallel sentiments , calling it the " best new television show of the year . " Ryan felt that the series would broaden the audience of the horror genre , as well as attract new fans . " Finally , a horror show on television for people who hate horror . It 's not that The Walking Dead isn 't scary or doesn 't contain gratuitous amounts of gore [ ... ] but , where other horror projects opt for camp , The Walking Dead grounds itself in reality . " Writing for The Atlantic , Scott Meslow affirmed that The Walking Dead was " as dark , intelligent , and uncompromising as any of AMC 's other dramas . " 
 St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch 's Gail Pennington appraised " Days Gone Bye " as " genuinely terrifying " , adding that despite being too gruesome for her tastes , it was " too engrossing not to watch . " Pennington commended the character development in the episode , stating that Darabont " finds time for the human tragedy of the situation . " In an A- grade review , Boston Herald journalist Mark Perigard said that the pilot episode was a " suspenseful thriller " , while Robert Bianco of USA Today avouched that it was " one killer of a zombie show . " The Wall Street Journal writer Nancy deWolf Smith felt that " Days Gone Bye " contained a cinematic quality to it ; " The pilot episode [ is ] so good that it has hooked even a zombie hater like me . " Steve West of Cinema Blend praised the episode , calling it " the best pilot since Lost 's introduction " and " a brilliant examination of what makes us human . " Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club gave the episode an ' A- ' grade , and described it as a " stunning debut " . 
 Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said that the installment was " fully dynamic and engaging " . " The Walking Dead is a promising human story built over a sea of grunting corpses . It 's a scare @-@ fest at points [ ... ] and it 's definitely extremely bloody , as zombie guts splatter all over the place like chunky borscht . The 90 @-@ minute premiere is a gory Halloween horror event , for sure . " Liz Kelly and Jen Chaney of The Washington Post reacted positively to the series premiere , deeming it as a " chilling show " , and exclaiming that it had a " very real sense that the world can go completely mad , and stay that way for good . " Kris King of Starpulse said that it was " a welcome reprieve from the camp @-@ laden world of zombie culture . " Josh Jackson of Paste gave the episode an 8 @.@ 8 out of 10 .

The survivors are terrific characters , and the gore is enough for any lunatic to love . " 
 Critics were polarized over Andrew Lincoln 's performance . Despite citing that his accent was " dodgy " , Pierce lauded Lincoln 's acting . " his body language and expression here is totally different now than when we saw him before , " he opined . " He 's a fast learner . " Gilbert referred to his accent as " spotty " , while Goldman professed that Lincoln fit into character very well ; " For much of the pilot , he 's on his own and exudes a lot of believable , shocked emotion , as Rick tries to process what he is seeing . Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter felt that Lincoln 's performance was one of the episode 's drawbacks . He wrote : " One drawback in [ The Walking Dead ] is that Lincoln plays his emotion a little too close to his deputy 's badge . We 're told – by him – that all he wants to do is find his wife and kid . His belief that they still are alive is the emotional drive of the story , but there 's not enough deep pain that seeps up to coat the dialogue Lincoln delivers . "

 = Han van Meegeren = 
 Henricus Antonius " Han " van Meegeren ( Dutch pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> vɑn <unk> ( n ) ] ; 10 October 1889 – 30 December 1947 ) was a Dutch painter and portraitist and is considered to be one of the most ingenious art forgers of the 20th century . 
 As a child , van Meegeren developed an enthusiasm for the paintings of the Dutch Golden Age , and later set out to become an artist himself . Art critics , however , decried his work as tired and derivative , and van Meegeren felt that they had destroyed his career . Thereupon , he decided to prove his talent to the critics by forging paintings of some of the world 's most famous artists , including Frans Hals , Pieter de Hooch , Gerard ter Borch , and Johannes Vermeer . He so well replicated the styles and colours of the artists that the best art critics and experts of the time regarded his paintings as genuine and sometimes exquisite . His most successful forgery was Supper at Emmaus , created in 1937 while living in the south of France . This painting was hailed as a real Vermeer by famous art experts such as Abraham Bredius . Bredius acclaimed it as " the masterpiece of Johannes Vermeer of Delft " and wrote of the " wonderful moment " of being " confronted with a hitherto unknown painting by a great master " . 
 During World War II , wealthy Dutchmen wanted to prevent a sellout of Dutch art to Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party , and they avidly bought van Meegeren 's forgeries , thinking them the work of the masters . Nevertheless , a falsified " Vermeer " ended up in the possession of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring . Following the war , the forgery was discovered in Göring 's possession , and van Meegeren was arrested on 29 May 1945 as a collaborator , as officials believed that he had sold Dutch cultural property to the Nazis . This would have been an act of treason , the punishment for which was death , so van Meegeren confessed to the less serious charge of forgery instead . He was convicted on falsification and fraud charges on 12 November 1947 , after a brief but highly publicized trial , and was sentenced to a modest punishment of one year in prison . He did not serve out his sentence , however ; he died 30 December 1947 , in the Valerius Clinic in Amsterdam , after two heart attacks . 
 It is estimated that van Meegeren duped buyers , including the government of the Netherlands , out of the equivalent of more than thirty million dollars in 1967 's money . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Han ( a diminutive version of Henri or Henricus ) van Meegeren was born in 1889 as the third of five children of middle @-@ class Roman Catholic parents in the provincial city of Deventer . He was the son of Augusta Louisa Henrietta Camps and Hendrikus Johannes van Meegeren , a French and history teacher at the <unk> ( training college for schoolteachers ) in the city of Deventer . 
 Early on , Han felt neglected and misunderstood by his father , as the elder van Meegeren strictly forbade his artistic development and constantly derided him . He was often forced by his father to write a hundred times , " I know nothing , I am nothing , I am capable of nothing . " While attending the Higher Burger School , he met teacher and painter <unk> Korteling ( 1853 – 1930 ) who became his mentor . Korteling had been inspired by Johannes Vermeer and showed the young van Meegeren how Vermeer had manufactured and mixed his colours . Korteling had rejected the Impressionist movement and other modern trends as decadent , degenerate art , and his strong personal influence probably later led van Meegeren to rebuff contemporary styles and paint exclusively in the style of the Dutch Golden Age . 
 Van Meegeren 's father did not share his son ’ s love of art ; instead , he encouraged Han to study architecture . In 1907 , van Meegeren , compelled by his father 's demands , left home to study at the Technische <unk> ( Delft Technical College ) in Delft , the hometown of Johannes Vermeer . He received drawing and painting lessons , as well . He easily passed his preliminary examinations but , because he did not wish to become an architect , he never took the <unk> ( final ) examination . He nevertheless proved to be an apt architect and designed the clubhouse for his rowing club DDS in Delft ( see image ) . This building still exists . 
 In 1913 , van Meegeren gave up his architecture studies and concentrated on drawing and painting at the art school in The Hague . On 8 January 1913 , he received the prestigious Gold Medal from the Technical University in Delft for his Study of the Interior of the Church of Saint Lawrence ( <unk> ) in Rotterdam . The award was given every five years to an art student who created the best work , and was accompanied by a gold medal . 
 On 18 April 1912 , van Meegeren married fellow art student Anna de <unk> who was expecting their first child . The couple went to live with Anna ’ s grandmother in Rijswijk . Their son Jacques Henri Emil was born on 26 August 1912 in Rijswijk . Jacques van Meegeren also became a painter ; he died on 26 October 1977 in Amsterdam . 
 = = Career as a legitimate painter = = 
 In the summer of 1914 , van Meegeren moved his family to Scheveningen . That year , he completed the diploma examination at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague . The diploma allowed him to teach , and he took a position as the assistant to Professor <unk> , the Professor of Drawing and Art History , for the small monthly salary of 75 guldens . In March 1915 , his daughter Pauline was born , later called Inez . To supplement his income , Han sketched posters and painted pictures for the commercial art trade , generally Christmas cards , still @-@ life , landscapes , and portraits . Many of these paintings are quite valuable today . 
 Van Meegeren showed his first paintings publicly in The Hague , where they were exhibited from April to May 1917 at the <unk> Pictura . In December 1919 , he was accepted as a select member to the <unk> <unk> , an exclusive society of writers and painters who met weekly on the premises of the <unk> . He painted the tame roe deer belonging to Princess Juliana in his studio at The Hague , opposite the Royal Palace Huis ten Bosch . He made many sketches and drawings of the deer , and painted <unk> ( The fawn ) in 1921 , which became quite popular in the Netherlands . He undertook numerous journeys to Belgium , France , Italy , and England , and acquired a name for himself as a talented portraitist . He earned stately fees through commissions from English and American socialites who spent their winter vacations on the Côte d 'Azur . His clients were impressed by his understanding of the 17th @-@ century techniques of the Dutch masters . Throughout his life , van Meegeren signed his own paintings with his own signature . 
 By all accounts , infidelity was responsible for the breakup of van Meegeren ’ s marriage to Anna de <unk> ; they were divorced on 19 July 1923 . Anna left with the children and moved to Paris where van Meegeren visited his children from time to time . He now dedicated himself to portraiture and began producing forgeries to increase his income . 
 He married actress Johanna Theresia <unk> in Woerden in 1928 , with whom he had been living for the past three years . Jo was also known under her stage name of Jo van <unk> , and she had previously been married to art critic and journalist Dr. C H. de Boer ( Karel de Boer ) . She brought their daughter Viola into the van Meegeren household .

 In the Netherlands , Han van Meegeren had become a well @-@ known painter . <unk> ( 1921 ) and <unk> ( 1928 ) were particularly popular . His first legitimate copies were painted in 1923 – his Laughing Cavalier and Happy Smoker – both in the style of Frans Hals . By 1928 , the similarity of van Meegeren ’ s paintings to those of the old masters began to draw the reproach of Dutch art critics , who were more interested in Cubist , Surrealist , and other movements . It was said that van Meegeren ’ s gift was in imitation and that his talent was limited , outside of copying other artists ' work . One critic wrote that he was " a gifted technician who has made a sort of composite facsimile of the Renaissance school , he has every virtue except originality . " In response to these comments , van Meegeren published a series of aggressive articles in the monthly magazine De <unk> ( " The Game Cock " ) . He raged against the art community together with journalist Jan <unk> between April 1928 and March 1930 , and lost any sympathy with the critics in the process . 
 Van Meegeren felt that his genius had been misjudged , and he set out to prove to the art critics that he could not only copy the style of the Dutch masters in his paintings , but produce a work of art so magnificent that it would rival the works of master painters . He moved with Jo to the South of France and began preparations for this ultimate forgery , which took him six years , from 1932 to 1937 . In a series of early exercises , he forged works by Frans Hals , Pieter de Hooch , Gerard ter Borch , and Johannes Vermeer . Finally , he chose to forge a painting by Vermeer as his masterpiece . Vermeer had not been particularly well @-@ known until the beginning of the twentieth century ; his works were both extremely valuable and scarce — only about 35 had survived . 
 Van Meegeren delved into the biographies of the old masters , studying their lives , occupations , trademark techniques , and catalogues . In October 1932 , famous art connoisseur and Rembrandt expert Dr. Abraham Bredius published an article about a recently discovered Vermeer which he described as a painting of a Man and Woman at a Spinet . The painting was later sold to Amsterdam banker Dr. Fritz <unk> . 
 = = = Inventing the " perfect forgery " = = = 
 In 1932 , van Meegeren moved to the village of Roquebrune @-@ Cap @-@ Martin with his wife . There he rented a furnished mansion called " Primavera " and set out to define the chemical and technical procedures that would be necessary to create his perfect forgeries . He bought authentic 17th century canvases and mixed his own paints from raw materials ( such as lapis lazuli , white lead , indigo , and cinnabar ) using old formulas to ensure that they were authentic . In addition , he created his own badger @-@ hair paintbrushes similar to those that Vermeer was known to have used . He came up with a scheme of using phenol formaldehyde ( Bakelite ) to cause the paints to harden after application , making the paintings appear as if they were 300 years old . After completing a painting , van Meegeren would bake it at 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) to 120 ° C ( 248 ° F ) to harden the paint , and then roll it over a cylinder to increase the cracks . Later , he would wash the painting in black India ink to fill in the cracks . 
 It took van Meegeren six years to work out his techniques , but ultimately he was pleased with his work on both artistic and deceptive levels . Two of these trial paintings were " Vermeers " : Lady Reading Music , after Vermeer ’ s Woman in Blue Reading a Letter at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam ; and Lady Playing Music , after Vermeer ’ s Woman with a Lute near a Window hanging in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City . Van Meegeren did not sell these paintings ; both are now at the Rijksmuseum . 
 Following a journey to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin , van Meegeren painted The Supper at Emmaus using the ultramarine blues and yellows preferred by Johannes Vermeer and other Dutch Golden Age painters . The experts assumed that Vermeer had studied in Italy , so van Meegeren used The Supper at Emmaus by Michelangelo <unk> da Caravaggio located at Italy ’ s <unk> di <unk> as a model . He had always wanted to walk in the steps of the masters , and he felt that his forgery was a fine work in its own right . He gave it to his friend , attorney C. A. Boon , telling him that it was a genuine Vermeer , and asked him to show it to Dr. Abraham Bredius in Monaco . Bredius examined the forgery in September 1937 and he accepted it as a genuine Vermeer and praised it highly . 
 The painting was purchased by The Rembrandt Society for <unk> ( € 235 @.@ 000 or about € 4 @.@ 640 @.@ 000 today ) , with the aid of wealthy shipowner Willem van der Vorm , and donated to the Museum <unk> Van Beuningen in Rotterdam . In 1938 , the piece was highlighted in a special exhibition at the Rotterdam museum , along with 450 Dutch masterpieces dating from 1400 – 1800 . A. <unk> wrote in the " Magazine for [ the ] History of Art " , " In the rather isolated area in which the Vermeer picture hung , it was as quiet as in a chapel . The feeling of the consecration overflows on the visitors , although the picture has no ties to ritual or church . " 
 In the summer of 1938 , van Meegeren moved to Nice , using the proceeds from the sale of The Supper at Emmaus to buy a 12 @-@ bedroom estate at Les <unk> de Cimiez . On the walls of the estate hung several genuine Old Masters . Two of his better forgeries were made here , Interior with <unk> and Interior with Drinkers , both displaying the signature of Pieter de Hooch . During his time in Nice , he painted his Last Supper I in the style of Vermeer . 
 He returned to the Netherlands in September 1939 as the Second World War threatened . He remained at a hotel in Amsterdam for several months and moved to the village of Laren in 1940 . Throughout 1941 , van Meegeren issued his designs , which he published in 1942 as a large and luxurious book entitled Han van Meegeren : <unk> I ( Drawings nr I ) . He also created several forgeries during this time , including The Head of Christ , The Last Supper II , The Blessing of Jacob , The Adulteress , and The Washing of the Feet — all in the manner of Vermeer . On 18 December 1943 , he divorced his wife , but this was only a formality ; the couple remained together , but a large share of his capital was transferred to her accounts as a safeguard against the uncertainties of the war . 
 In December 1943 , the van <unk> moved to Amsterdam where they took up residence in the exclusive Keizersgracht 321 . His forgeries had earned him between 5 @.@ 5 and 7 @.@ 5 million guilders ( or about $ 25 – 30 million today ) . He used this money to purchase a large amount of real estate , jewelry , and works of art , and to further his luxurious lifestyle . In a 1946 interview , he told Marie Louise <unk> de la <unk> that he owned 52 houses and 15 country houses around Laren , among them <unk> , beautiful mansions along the famous Amsterdam canals .

 During the German occupation of the Netherlands , one of van Meegeren ’ s agents sold the Vermeer forgery Christ with the Adulteress to Nazi banker and art dealer Alois Miedl in 1942 . Experts could probably have identified it as a forgery ; as van Meegeren 's health declined , so did the quality of his work . He chain @-@ smoked , drank heavily , and became addicted to morphine @-@ laced sleeping pills . Fortunately for van Meegeren , there were no genuine Vermeers available for comparison , since most museum collections were in protective storage as a prevention against war damage . Miedl then sold it to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring for 1 @.@ 65 million guilders ( $ 625 @,@ 000 or $ 7 million today ) . 
 Göring showcased the Vermeer forgery at his residence in Carinhall ( about 65 kilometers north of Berlin ) . On 25 August 1943 , Göring hid his collection of looted artwork , including Christ with the Adulteress , in an Austrian salt mine , along with 6 @,@ 750 other pieces of artwork looted by the Nazis . On 17 May 1945 , Allied forces entered the salt mine where Captain Harry Anderson discovered the previously unknown " Vermeer " . 
 In May 1945 , the Allied forces questioned banker and art dealer Alois Miedl regarding the newly discovered Vermeer . Based on Miedl 's confession , the painting was traced back to van Meegeren . On 29 May 1945 , he was arrested and charged with fraud and aiding and abetting the enemy . He was remanded to <unk> prison as an alleged Nazi collaborator and plunderer of Dutch cultural property , threatened by the authorities with the death penalty . He labored over his predicament , but eventually confessed to forging paintings attributed to Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch . He exclaimed , " The painting in Göring ’ s hands is not , as you assume , a Vermeer of Delft , but a Van Meegeren ! I painted the picture ! " It took some time to verify this and he was detained for several months in the Headquarters of the Military Command at <unk> 468 in Amsterdam . He painted his last forgery between July and December 1945 in the presence of reporters and court @-@ appointed witnesses : Jesus among the Doctors , also called Young Christ in the Temple in the style of Vermeer . After the trial painting was finished , he was transferred to the fortress prison <unk> . Van Meegeren was released from prison in January or February 1946 . 
 = = Trial and prison sentence = = 
 The trial of Han van Meegeren began on 29 October 1947 in Room 4 of the Regional Court in Amsterdam . The collaboration charges had been dropped , since the expert panel had found that the " Vermeer " sold to Hermann Göring had been a forgery and was , therefore , not the cultural property of the Netherlands . Public prosecutor H. A. <unk> brought charges of forgery and fraud and demanded a sentence of two years in prison . 
 The court commissioned an international group of experts to address the authenticity of van Meegeren 's paintings . The commission included curators , professors , and doctors from the Netherlands , Belgium , and England , and was led by the director of the chemical laboratory at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium , Paul B. Coremans . The commission examined the eight Vermeer and Frans Hals paintings which van Meegeren had identified as forgeries . With the help of the commission , Dr. Coremans was able to determine the chemical composition of van Meegeren 's paints . He found that van Meegeren had prepared the paints by using the <unk> resins Bakelite and <unk> as paint <unk> . A bottle with exactly that ingredient had been found in van Meegeren 's studio . This chemical component was introduced and manufactured in the 20th century , proving that the " Vermeers " and " Frans <unk> " examined by the commission were in fact made by van Meegeren . The commission 's other findings suggested that the dust in the craquelure was too homogeneous to be of natural origin . The matter found in the craquelure appeared to come from India ink , which had accumulated even in areas that natural dirt or dust would never have reached . The paint had become so hard that alcohol , strong acids , and bases did not attack the surface , a clear indication that the surface had not been formed in a natural manner . The craquelure on the surface did not always match that in the ground layer , which would certainly have been the case with a natural craquelure . Thus , the test results obtained by the commission appeared to confirm that the works were forgeries created by van Meegeren , but their authenticity continued to be debated by some of the experts until 1967 and 1977 , when new investigative techniques were used to analyze the paintings ( see below ) . 
 On 12 November 1947 , the Fourth Chamber of the Amsterdam Regional Court found Han van Meegeren guilty of forgery and fraud , and sentenced him to a minimal one year in prison . 
 = = Death = = 
 While waiting to be moved to prison , van Meegeren returned to his house at 321 Keizersgracht , where his health continued to decline . During this last month of his life , he strolled freely around his neighborhood . 
 Van Meegeren suffered a heart attack on 26 November 1947 , the last day to appeal the ruling , and was rushed to the <unk> hospital in Amsterdam . While at the hospital , he suffered a second heart attack on 29 December , and was pronounced dead at 5 : 00 pm on 30 December 1947 at the age of 58 . His family and several hundred of his friends attended his funeral at the <unk> Westerveld Crematorium chapel . In 1948 , his urn was buried in the general cemetery in the village of <unk> ( municipality of Deventer ) . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After his death , the court ruled that Van Meegeren ’ s estate be auctioned and the proceeds from his property and the sale of his counterfeits be used to refund the buyers of his works and to pay income taxes on the sale of his paintings . Van Meegeren filed for bankruptcy in December 1945 . On 5 and 6 September 1950 , the furniture and other possessions in his Amsterdam house at Keizersgracht 321 were auctioned by order of the court , along with 738 other pieces of furniture and works of art , including numerous paintings by old and new masters from his private collection . The house was auctioned separately on 4 September , estimated to be worth 65 @,@ 000 guilders . The proceeds of the sale together with the house amounted to 123 @,@ 000 guilders . Van Meegeren ’ s unsigned The Last Supper I was bought for 2 @,@ 300 guilders , while Jesus among the Doctors ( which van Meegeren had painted while in detention ) sold for 3 @,@ 000 guilders ( about $ 800 or about $ 7 @,@ 000 today . ) Today the painting hangs in a Johannesburg church . The sale of the entire estate amounted to 242 @,@ 000 guilders ( $ 60 @,@ 000 , or about $ 500 @,@ 000 today ) . 
 Throughout his trial and bankruptcy , Van Meegeren maintained that his second wife Jo had nothing to do with the creation and sale of his forgeries . A large part of his considerable wealth had been transferred to her when they were divorced during the war and the money would have been confiscated if she had been ruled to be an accomplice . Van Meegeren told the same story to all authors , journalists , and biographers : " Jo didn ’ t know " , and apparently most believed him . Some biographers believe , however , that Jo must have known the truth . Her involvement was never proven and she was able to keep her substantial capital . Jo outlived her husband by many years , always in great luxury , until her death at the age of 91 . 
 = = = M. Jean Decoen 's objection = = = 
 M. Jean Decoen , a Brussels art expert and restorer , stated in his 1951 book that he believed The Supper at Emmaus and The Last Supper II to be genuine Vermeers . Decoen went on to state that conclusions of Dr. Paul Coremans 's panel of experts were wrong and that the paintings should again be examined . Daniel George van Beuningen was the buyer of The Last Supper II , Interior with Drinkers , and The Head of Christ , and he demanded that Dr. Paul Coremans publicly admit that he had erred in his analysis . Coremans refused and van Beuningen sued him , alleging that Coremans ’ s wrongful branding of The Last Supper II diminished the value of his " Vermeer " and asking for compensation of £ 500 @,@ 000 ( about $ 1 @.@ 3 million or about $ 10 million today ) . The trial was set for 2 June 1955 but was delayed owing to van Beuningen 's death on 29 May 1955 . Approximately seven months later , the court heard the case on behalf of van Beuningen 's heirs . The court found in favour of Coremans , and the findings of his commission were upheld . 
 = = = Further investigations = = = 
 In 1967 , the Artists Material Center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh examined several of the " Vermeers " in their collection , under the direction of Robert Feller and Bernard <unk> . The examination confirmed that several of their paintings were in fact created using materials invented in the 20th century . They concluded that the " Vermeers " in their possession were modern and could thus be Van Meegeren forgeries . This confirmed the findings of the 1946 Coremans commission , and refuted the claims made by M. Jean Decoen . The test results obtained by the Carnegie Mellon team are summarized below . 
 Han van Meegeren knew that white lead was used during Vermeer ’ s time , but of course he had to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade , which had changed significantly since the 17th century . During Vermeer ’ s time , Dutch lead was mined from deposits located in the Low Countries ; however , by the 19th century , most lead was imported from Australia and the Americas , and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and in the content of trace elements found in the ores . Dutch white lead was extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony , while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony , as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process . 
 Forgeries in which modern lead or white lead pigment has been used can be recognized by using a technique called Pb ( Lead ) <unk> @-@ Dating . Pb @-@ 210 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of lead that is part of the uranium @-@ 238 Radioactive decay series , and has a half life of 22 @.@ 3 years . To determine the amount of Pb @-@ 210 , the alpha radiation emitted by another element , polonium @-@ 210 ( Po @-@ 210 ) , is measured . Thus it is possible to estimate the age of a painting , within a few years ' span , by extrapolating the Pb @-@ 210 content present in the paint used to create the painting . 
 The white lead in the painting The Supper at Emmaus had polonium @-@ 210 values of 8 @.@ 5 ± 1 @.@ 4 and radium @-@ 226 ( part of the uranium @-@ 238 radioactive decay series ) values of 0 @.@ 8 ± 0 @.@ 3 . In contrast , the white lead found in Dutch paintings from 1600 – 1660 had polonium @-@ 210 values of 0 @.@ 23 ± 0 @.@ 27 and radium @-@ 226 values of 0 @.@ 40 ± 0 @.@ 47 . 
 In 1977 , another investigation was undertaken by the States forensic labs of the Netherlands using up @-@ to @-@ date techniques , including gas chromatography , to formally confirm the origin of six van Meegeren forgeries that had been alleged to be genuine Vermeers , including the Emmaus and the Last Supper . The conclusions of the 1946 commission were again reaffirmed and upheld by the Dutch judicial system . 
 In 1998 , A & E ran a program called <unk> , Schemes & Scoundrels highlighting Van Meegeren 's life and art forgeries , many of which had been confiscated as Nazi loot . The program was hosted by skeptic James Randi and also featured the stories of Victor Lustig and Soapy Smith . 
 In July 2011 , the BBC TV programme Fake or Fortune investigated a copy of Dirck van <unk> 's The Procuress owned by the Courtauld Institute . Opinion had been divided as to whether it was a 17th @-@ century studio work or a van Meegeren fake . The programme used chemical analysis of the paint to show that it contained bakelite and thus confirmed that the painting was a 20th @-@ century fake .

 Van Meegeren played different roles , some of which were shrouded in fraudulent intentions , as he sought to fulfill his goal of besting his critics . Han ’ s father was said to have once told him , " You are a cheat and always will be . " On the other hand , his brothers and sisters perceived him as loyal , generous , and affectionate , and he was always loving and helpful to his own children . The question " what was his character " cannot be answered unequivocally . Indeed , recent works question many of the existing assumptions about van Meegeren and the motivations for his career in forgery . With Han van Meegeren , everything was double @-@ edged , and his character presents itself as fragments rather than unity . In 2008 , Harvard @-@ trained art historian Jonathan Lopez had become fluent in Dutch and published ' The Man who made Vermeers , <unk> the legend of master Forger Han Van Meegeren ' . His extensive research confirmed that van Meegeren started to make forgeries , not so much by feeling misunderstood and undervalued by art critics as for the income that it generated , income which he needed to support his addictions and promiscuity . Lopez confirmed the veracity of Jan <unk> 's article in ' De <unk> ' in which <unk> reported that the book ' <unk> 1 ' by van Van Meegeren was in Hitler 's library , signed by the artist and dedicated to the Führer . 
 Van Meegeren continued to paint after he was released from prison , signing his works with his own name . His new @-@ found popularity ensured quick sales of his new paintings , often selling at prices that were many times higher than before he had been unmasked as a forger . Van Meegeren also told the news media that he had " an offer from a Manhattan gallery to come to the U.S. and paint portraits ' in the 17th century manner ' at $ 6 @,@ 000 a throw . " 
 A Dutch opinion poll conducted in October 1947 placed Han van Meegeren ’ s popularity second in the nation , behind only the Prime Minister 's and slightly ahead of Prince <unk> , the husband of Princess Juliana . The Dutch people viewed Van Meegeren as a cunning trickster who had successfully fooled the Dutch art experts and , more importantly , Hermann Göring himself . In fact , according to a contemporary account , Göring was informed that his " Vermeer " was actually a forgery and " [ Göring ] looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world " . Lopez indicates that Han van Meegeren 's defense during his trial in Amsterdam was a masterpiece of trickery , forging his own personality into a true Dutchman eager to trick his critics and also the Dutch people by pretending that he sold Christ and the Adulteress , a fake Vermeer , to Göring because he wanted to teach the Nazi a lesson . Van Meegeren remains one of the most ingenious art counterfeiters of the 20th century . After his trial , however , he declared , " My triumph as a counterfeiter was my defeat as [ a ] creative artist . "

 It is possible that other fakes hang in art collections all over the world , probably in the style of 17th @-@ century Dutch masters , including works in the style of Frans Hals and the school of Hals , Pieter de Hooch , and Gerard ter Borch . Jacques van Meegeren suggested that his father had created a number of other forgeries , during interviews with journalists regarding discussions with his father . Some of these paintings include : 
 Boy with a Little Dog and The <unk> after Frans Hals . The Frans Hals catalogue by Frans L. M. <unk> mentions four paintings by this name attributed to Frans Hals or the " school of Frans Hals " . One of these could easily be by van Meegeren . 
 A counterpart to Vermeer ’ s Girl with a Pearl Earring . A painting called Smiling Girl hangs in the National Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. ( bequest Andrew W. Mellon ) that could fit with Jacques ’ description and has been recognized by the museum as a fake . It was attributed to Theo van <unk> , friend and partner of van Meegeren , but may have been painted by van Meegeren .
