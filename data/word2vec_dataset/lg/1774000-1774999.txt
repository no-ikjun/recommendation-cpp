 Prior to the 1961 Act , the areas trustees could invest in were based on the Trustee Act 1925 , which set up a " Statutory Lists " system . The list contained only those investments available at the Post Office , along with land . It did not take into account the deprecation of currency or inflation , meaning that if the trustees invested in stocks and shares they were at risk of losing money simply because of the falling value of the pound sterling . As a result , even though the income from a trust might remain nominally constant , the real value of that income could be much reduced over the lifetime of the trust . This was recognised by lawyers , who had been advising their clients to structure trusts in such a way as to allow their trustees to invest in wider areas than the Statutory Lists . In 1952 the report of the Nathan Committee advocated reform , and the government published a White Paper on " Government Policy on Charitable Trusts in England and Wales " in 1955 , which proposed a reform of the Statutory Lists system . This came about under the Variation of Trusts Act 1958 , which allowed trustees to apply to the courts to widen their investment powers , a process that was expensive and slow . 
 A statement in the House of Lords on 13 May 1959 promised further reform , and a detailed White Paper was published in December . In November 1960 a Bill based on that report was introduced in the House of Lords , where it was much scrutinised by solicitors and barristers ( particularly at the Committee stage ) owing to its complexity . The Bill received its royal assent on 3 August 1961 , and passed into law as the Trustee Investments Act 1961 . 
 = = Act = = 
 The Act replaced the old Statutory Lists system of investments with two sets of " narrow range " investments and a set of " wide range " investments , both covered in the first Schedule of the Act . The first set of " narrow range " investments included Defence Bonds , National Savings Certificates and similar " small " investments , which could be bought at a Post Office and did not require the trustee to seek advice before investing . The second set included debentures in certain British companies and gilt @-@ edged securities , with the trustee expected to seek written advice from a person he believed was qualified to give it before investing . " Wide range " investments included unit trusts and shares in certain British companies , and shares in building societies . 
 If trustees wished to invest in " wide range " investments , they were required to have the trust fund valued and divided into two parts – three quarters of the value in one part , and a quarter in the other . The quarter was to be invested in " wide range " investments , while the remainder was restricted to " narrow range " investments . The valuation had to be done by " a person reasonably believed by the trustee to be qualified to make it " . This division of funds was permanent , and the quarter and three quarters became distinct units . The permanence of the division was the Act 's most controversial section . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Act was considered a bad one , since it required a " very conservative investment policy for trustees " . The powers given to investment trustees were restrictive and narrow , and the trustees were expected to go through expensive and complicated procedures to exercise them . The Act was criticised almost immediately for its complexity and <unk> . A 1997 paper by the Law Commission called it " overly cautious and restrictive " , and suggested that some trusts were underperforming because of the difficulty of complying with the Act 's provisions . The Trustee Act 2000 repealed most of the 1961 Act and now serves as the principal piece of guidance on trustee investments .

 The Dirty Picture is a 2011 Indian biographical drama film inspired by the life of Silk Smitha , a South Indian actress noted for her erotic roles . The filmmakers have clarified that the story is not officially or literally based on Smitha alone , but on many of her Southern contemporaries such as Disco Shanti . It also resembles the personal lives of other women in popular culture , including Hollywood actress and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe . The film was directed by Milan Luthria and co @-@ produced by Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor , after Ekta came up with the idea and asked screenwriter Rajat Aroraa to pen a story based on it .

She is insulted by the casting director for being unattractive and useless after trying to get a role in a film . Determined to convince him she spontaneously grabs the role of a side dancer . However , she dances with whips and using erotic movements which annoys the film 's director , Abraham ( Emraan Hashmi ) . He edits out Reshma 's entire dance sequence from the film . The film fails at the box office much to the dismay of the producer Selva Ganesh ( Rajesh Sharma ) , who later offers Reshma a song in his upcoming film , and suggests that she now be referred to as " Silk " . 
 At the first shoot " Silk " dances with Suryakanth ( Naseeruddin Shah ) , her childhood idol . Silk seduces him by offering a long @-@ term sexual relationship . Meanwhile , Abraham proposes a new film to Selva Ganesh and is keen to cast Suryakanth .

 Ekta Kapoor launched the film with director Milan Luthria soon after their collaboration Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai became a hit . She said that The Dirty Picture would be India 's answer to the Academy Award nominated film Boogie Nights . Later in a press conference , Kapoor clarified that neither of Balaji 's forthcoming films , Ragini MMS nor The Dirty Picture , were " porn films " as they had been made out to be . 
 Kapoor has gone on record to add , " I would be surprised if I don 't get unbelievable critical acclaim for The Dirty Picture and a national award for my actress , Vidya Balan . The film has one of the most well @-@ written scripts I have come across and a lot of youngsters in my office have looked at it with great admiration . " She also pointed out that the purpose of the film was neither to justify nor criticise Smitha 's life , but for the audience to live her life . Additionally , all actors , including Balan and Shah attended workshops for almost two months before filming could begin , in order to familiarise themselves with the body language of their characters . 
 When screenwriter Rajat Aroraa initially started working , taking cues from producer Kapoor , the scope of the film was much smaller , primarily looking back to the soft @-@ pornography scene of the 1980s . But gradually as work progressed , the scope widened to include the controversial romances of Smitha through a fictionalised biopic . While researching for the film , director Luthria and screenwriter Aroraa found little material in film magazines of that period , as " women like Silk Smitha were often ignored by film magazines , except for gossip column mentions " . Thus they derived many of the details of her life from anecdotes and party gossips , and then fictionalised them . Apart from depicting the pomp of the Telugu / Tamil film industry , the screenplay also takes up issues such as money management by actors , " their string of broken relationships " , and the way they " led lonely lives and met with tragic ends " . For inspiration , instead of looking at South Indian films of the period , the team turned to the work of mainstream Bollywood directors like Manmohan Desai , Vijay Anand , Raj Kapoor , Feroz Khan and G.P. Sippy ; and in order to put the global soft @-@ porn industry in context , the team looked into Boogie Nights ( 1997 ) and The People vs. Larry Flynt ( 1996 ) . The final script became a " fictionalised , women @-@ oriented , generalised perspective on the 1980s film industry " . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 After initial talks with actresses Kangana Ranaut and Bipasha Basu fell through , Vidya Balan was offered the lead role . When Balan was narrated the script and shown sketches of what she needed to wear for the portrayal , she felt uncomfortable . Luthria added , " We couldn 't have found anyone better than Vidya for this role . It 's a casting that very few would think is viable because it is going to be nothing like Vidya has done before . But I am confident she will push the envelope as far as she can " . 
 Regarding the criticism that Balan 's character might evoke , Luthria clarified , " I wanted Vidya to know that what she 's doing is not crass or crude but can be shown aesthetically in a sensual manner with a touch of class . What her character does , is not cheap . " As a reference point , he also asked Balan to study ' similar themed ' films such as Burlesque and Chicago . Balan also underwent salsa training to fine @-@ tune herself with Smitha 's languid body language . 
 Next , Naseeruddin Shah was cast as an ageing South Indian superstar with " hideous wigs , dark glasses and painted @-@ on mustaches " . He also performed a " fast dance number " in the film , a full 22 years after he last did it in the song " <unk> <unk> " from <unk> ( 1989 ) . Regarding his character , Ekta Kapoor stated , " This role requires him to play to the gallery , provoke claps , laughs , and whistles and I know he can pull it off because Naseer is the Shah of all actors " , while Luthria added , " Expect a man who unabashedly enjoys the flesh of women " . 
 Tusshar Kapoor and Emraan Hashmi were next cast in lead roles . While it was known that Tusshar Kapoor would play the role of a script @-@ writer and Smitha 's love interest , the nature of Hashmi 's role was unknown for a while . The casting received praise from trade pundits , with Taran Adarsh commenting , " Known for engaging in interesting and unconventional casting in all its previous releases , Balaji has again tackled the unheard of , by casting Emraan Hashmi and Vidya Balan – two of the most successful stars of today – opposite each other in The Dirty Picture . The perfect combination of mass and class promises to make this controversial film yet another winner from the Balaji stable . "

 Filming was to begin on 21 May 2011 ; a week after the release of Kapoor 's Ragini MMS . But due to certain production delays , it began a week later . Balan , being a religious person , organised a puja on the sets before principal photography could begin . 
 The first leg of filming took place at Mumbai 's Film City where an elaborate set re @-@ creating Chennai ( then Madras ) of the 80s , was set up . The second schedule was shot in Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad . The song ' Ishq <unk> ' was shot at Bidar fort in Bidar , Karnataka . Filming was completed in September , before venturing into post @-@ production , ahead of the December release . Director Luthria wanted to depict a sense of discomfort between the film 's two lead characters , Balan and Hashmi , a " meeting of two completely different worlds " . So he didn 't allow them to interact and get comfortable with each other during film workshops ahead of the shoot . Since he considered them " the unlikeliest pair to come together " , he brought them together right into the shoot filming an important scene , where they had to insult each other . Though he was initially anxious , it all turned out well and he was surprised by the resulting chemistry .

 As a part of the film promotion , actors Vidya Balan , Tusshar Kapoor and Emraan Hashmi made appearances on the popular TV show Bigg Boss ( Season 5 ) aired on Colors on 26 November 2011 .

 Kane 's former youth coach Alex <unk> has said of him : 
 When he first came into the under @-@ 18s as a 15 year old , he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly . He moved slightly awkwardly , he was a bit cumbersome . But look closer , he had a lot of ability , a great technique . I think he surprised people how good he was . Tactically he was very flexible . He often played in midfield . I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder . 
 While a teenager , Kane initially struggled in Tottenham 's academy , as partially due to his date of birth in July , he was not as physically developed as other players , nor was he as quick . However , he gained the respect of coaches with his technique and desire for self @-@ improvement . 
 When profiling Kane in February 2013 , Talksport said that he was best as a second striker , despite also having ability as a centre forward or in a wide position . They wrote that he preferred to place his shots , although he could also score from distance . The report also noted that he had good pace , but was weak in the air and had not scored on his loan at Norwich . Initially a back @-@ up to £ 26 million Spanish import Roberto Soldado and frequently loaned out , Kane was eventually made Tottenham 's starting forward by manager Mauricio Pochettino . 
 = = = Analysis = = = 
 Former Tottenham manager David Pleat described Kane as an " old @-@ fashioned traditional centre @-@ forward " . Clive Allen , who coached him at Tottenham , stated that " one thing I 'd say about him , which unfortunately you don 't say about a lot of young footballers , is that he had a passion for the game . He loves football , he loves playing , he loves scoring goals " . His former Tottenham under @-@ 21 coach Les Ferdinand likened Kane 's movement to their former forward Teddy Sheringham , and the power and accuracy of his shots to Alan Shearer . 
 Kane 's style of play has been compared to that of former Tottenham forward Jürgen Klinsmann , a comparison Kane called flattering in February 2015 . In March 2015 , Football Association chairman Greg Dyke named Kane as the benchmark for clubs producing young English players . Shearer said that month that the three best strikers playing in the league were Kane , Diego Costa and Sergio Agüero . In November 2015 , a writer for the Daily Mail theorised that Kane could be the striker in a spine of Tottenham players in the England team , alongside Eric Dier and Dele Alli . 
 After Tottenham 's victory over Chelsea in January 2015 , blogger Chris Miller wrote " Nobody thought he was the guy who was going to give that performance against Chelsea " . In February 2015 , BBC Sport wrote that Kane was best as a lone striker , with his " hold @-@ up play and close control " making him apt in other positions as well . Also that month , Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy said that the England team should be built around Kane , stating " I 'm struggling to see a weakness in the lad 's game " .

 = Sebastian Shaw ( actor ) = 
 Sebastian Lewis Shaw ( 29 May 1905 – 23 December 1994 ) was an English actor , director , novelist , playwright and poet . During his 65 @-@ year career , he appeared in dozens of stage performances and more than 40 film and television productions . 
 Shaw was born and brought up in Holt , Norfolk , and made his acting debut at age eight at a London theatre . He studied acting at Gresham 's School and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art . Although he worked primarily on the London stage , he made his Broadway debut in 1929 , when he played one of the two murderers in Rope 's End . He appeared in his first film , Caste , in 1930 and quickly began to create a name for himself in films . He described himself as a " rotten actor " as a youth and said his success was primarily due to his good looks . He claimed to mature as a performer only after returning from service in the Royal Air Force during World War II . 
 Shaw was particularly known for his performances in productions of Shakespeare plays which were considered daring and ahead of their time . In 1966 , he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company , where he remained for a decade and delivered some of his most acclaimed performances . He also wrote several poems and a novel , The Christening , in 1975 . He is also known for his brief but important performance in Return of the Jedi , the original third installment in the Star Wars franchise , in which he portrayed an unmasked Darth Vader and Anakin Skywalker 's ghost in the original version of the film . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Shaw was one of three children born to Dr. Geoffrey Shaw , the music master at Gresham 's School , a Norfolk independent boarding school , where Shaw began his education . His uncle , Martin Shaw , was a composer of church music , and his family 's love of music heavily influenced Shaw 's career path . Shaw made his acting debut at age eight on the London stage as one of the juvenile band in The <unk> Bird at the Royal Court Theatre in Chelsea on New Year 's Day of 1914 . During his time at Gresham 's , he also played Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew , his first of many performances from the works of William Shakespeare ; schoolmate W. H. Auden , who would go on to become a highly regarded poet , portrayed Katherina in the play opposite him . After Gresham 's , Shaw planned to become a painter and spent two years at the Slade School of Fine Art before switching his interests to acting ; regarding the change , his father informed him , " I wondered when you would come to your senses . " He earned a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in Bloomsbury , London . Actor Charles Laughton enrolled in the Academy at the same time as Shaw , who later said his first impression of Laughton was " a poor fat boy " . Although Shaw and his fellow students initially felt pity for Laughton , they were quickly impressed with his talent . 
 Shaw appeared in regional theatres in Bristol , Liverpool and Hull . In 1925 , he performed in London as the Archangel in The Sign of the Sun , and played first Lewis Dodd and then the Major in separate productions of The Constant Nymph . He received instruction in verse speaking under famed theatre director William Bridges @-@ Adams in the Stratford Festival Company at Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon , where he played some of his early Shakespeare roles , including Romeo in Romeo and Juliet , Ferdinand in The Tempest and Prince Hal in Henry IV in 1926 . He was criticised for the audacity he displayed in the latter role . When Prince Hal takes on his kingship and rejects the self @-@ indulgent character Falstaff , convention of the day called for Prince Hal to change from a jovial drinking partner to an arrogant snob , but Shaw saw the view as simple @-@ minded and contradictory toward Shakespeare 's script . Instead , he displayed inward regrets about leaving Falstaff and accepting the new responsibilities . The interpretation was criticised at the time but , years later , became the standard approach to the character . 
 Shaw made his Broadway debut in 1929 , when he played the murderer Wyndham Brandon in Patrick Hamilton 's stage thriller , Rope 's End . In 1929 , he married Margaret Delamere and lived with her in the Albany , an apartment complex off of Piccadilly in London . The two would eventually have a daughter together named Drusilla ( born 1932 ) . He returned to the works of William Shakespeare in 1931 , playing Claudio in Measure for Measure at London 's Fortune Playhouse . In 1932 he once again played Romeo at the Embassy Theatre . Other works around this period included productions of Ivor Novello 's Sunshine Sisters in 1933 , Double Door alongside actress Sybil Thorndike in 1934 , J.M. Barrie 's A Kiss for Cinderella in 1937 , and Robert Morley 's Goodness , How Sad in 1938 . 
 The first film Shaw appeared in was Caste in 1930 . He soon began to make a name for himself in films such as Brewster 's Millions in 1935 , Men Are Not Gods in 1936 and Farewell Again in 1937 . He was making about £ 300 a week during this stage of his career , a significant sum higher than the salary of the British Prime Minister of the time . He brought what the Daily Telegraph described as a " smooth villainy " to the role of Frank Sutton in The Squeaker in 1937 , while in 1939 he played the hero Cmdr. David Blacklock alongside Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson in The Spy in Black , Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger 's first collaboration . Shaw described himself as a film buff and called Academy Award @-@ winning actor Spencer Tracy his " great god of all screen actors " ; he was so impressed by Tracy 's technique that he claimed to become depressed while watching his films because Tracy made acting look simple , while Shaw claimed to find it so difficult to master himself . 
 = = World War II and post @-@ war career = = 
 When World War II broke out , Shaw took a break from acting and joined the Royal Air Force . He was commissioned as an Acting @-@ Pilot Officer on probation in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch on 25 April 1941 and over the next three months was promoted to Pilot Officer on probation , then Flying Officer and then Flight Lieutenant . According to his obituary in the Guardian , he saw little action in the service and was told the only chance he would have to fly would be as a rear gunner . Some of his fellow airmen hounded Shaw for autographs while others mocked his posh accent , to which he retaliated with an excellent and unflattering imitation of their less refined speech . He continued to hold a Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve commission after the war until he resigned the commission on 10 February 1954 ; he was permitted to retain his rank . 
 Immediately upon returning to London after the war , Shaw lost his Albany flat and his acting contract , and essentially had to restart his acting career . Although he made 20 films before the war and had already begun to develop a reputation as a strong leading man , in later years he would describe himself as " a rotten actor " in the 1930s who landed roles based mainly on his good looks . He used the phrase " a piece of cinema beefcake " to describe himself as an actor during that period . He felt that after his return home from military service , he learned to act properly and began to mature as a performer . Shaw 's Royal Air Force experience was put to good use when he played a pilot in Journey Together , the 1946 RAF training film in which actor Edward G. Robinson coached actor Richard Attenborough in the rudiments of flying . 
 In 1945 , Shaw returned to the Embassy Theatre to direct Fyodor Dostoevsky 's The Gambler . Significant theatre roles that decade included Hercules in The Thracian Horses at the Lyric Theatre , Hammersmith in 1946 , Mr. Hern @-@ Lawrence in Florida Scott @-@ Maxwell 's experimental I Said to Myself at the Mercury Theatre , Notting Hill Gate in 1947 , Sir James Kirkham in His Excellency at Prince 's Theatre in 1950 , and Filmer <unk> , MP , in Arthur Wing Pinero 's His House In Order at New Theatre in 1951 . In 1956 , he played the title role in the first British production of Hugo von <unk> 's Everyman . That same year , he wrote the lyrics to his father 's ballad @-@ opera , All at Sea , which played at the Royal College of Music . In 1957 , he played Lucifer in Brother Lucifer in Shrewsbury , Shropshire , and a sinister Venetian agent in Jonathan Griffin 's The Hidden King in Edinburgh . 
 As Shaw grew older , his reputation as a dramatic actor grew stronger , and he became known for a sharp intelligence and dignified style . Although his good looks diminished , reviewers felt that he used his florid and weatherbeaten face well in evoking grandeur and self @-@ assuredness in such roles as generals , priests and his familiar Shakespearean parts . In 1956 , his wife Margaret Delamere died ; she was survived by their daughter Drusilla . Shaw began a romantic relationship in the mid @-@ 1950s with Joan Ingpen , the well @-@ known classical music and opera talent agent who had previously represented him . The two were romantically involved , to the point that she took his surname , until Shaw 's death . During the 1980s , however , Shaw also had a brief relationship with Harriet Ravenscroft , the mother of the disc jockey John Peel , whom he met while performing at Ludlow Castle at Ludlow . He split his time between Ingpen and Ravenscroft on a four @-@ day rotating basis to which both women consented . Although Peel got along with Shaw and said he made his mother happy , he said he did not feel comfortable with the arrangement . He felt it disrupted his mother 's friendships and prospects for a more stable relationship . 
 In 1965 , British theatre director William Gaskill was named artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre , where he hoped to re @-@ establish a repertoire . He approached Shaw , who had made his acting début at the Royal Court Theatre as a youth , and Shaw agreed to return . There he delivered several performances over the next year , including General Conrad von <unk> in John Osborne 's A Patriot for Me ; various roles in Ann Jellicoe 's Shelley ; Sir Francis Harker in N.F. Simpson 's The Cresta Run and Pte <unk> in John Arden 's Serjeant Musgrave 's Dance .

 In 1966 , Shaw joined the Royal Shakespeare Company , where he spent the next decade of his career and eventually became an associate artist . He mostly appeared in Shakespeare plays , including the title role in Cymbeline , Edmund of Langley in Richard II , the King in All 's Well That Ends Well , Ulysses in Troilus and Cressida , and Leonato in Much Ado About Nothing . The Times described his performance in the title role of Cymbeline as " awe @-@ inspiring " , and The Independent described his performance as Polonius in Hamlet as " unrivalled in his complacency and sense of circumstance " . The Telegraph described his performance of Gloucester in King Lear as " doleful " and his performance of Duncan in Macbeth as " decent " . Many of the company 's Shakespearean productions at the time were considered interpretive and modern , which drew criticism from some traditionalists , but Shaw defended the experimental nature of the shows and rejected the notion that plays should be restricted to preconceived interpretations . 
 During his time with the company , he also demonstrated what the Daily Telegraph called a " crusty charm " as Sir Oblong Fitz Oblong in Robert Bolt 's children 's play The <unk> of Baron <unk> . He was also noted as possessing a gift for dry comedy during this period of his acting career , exemplified by his roles in Maxim Gorky 's plays Enemies and <unk> . He demonstrated a particular knack for Russian comedy in Jonathan Miller 's productions of the Anton Chekhov plays Three Sisters and Ivanov . 
 In 1978 , Shaw earned acclaim for his performance as a judge in the stage debut of Whose Life Is It Anyway ? at the Mermaid Theatre . The production won Laurence Olivier Awards for Best Play and Best Actor ( Tom Conti ) . Although 73 years old , Shaw did not let his age slow down his career . During the run of this production a mugger tried to steal his money , but Shaw chased him down , tackled him and recovered his property . Later that year , he was painted in the nude by his nephew , Brian Ocean . During his later years , Shaw suffered a physical disability that made him tremble , which had a negative impact on his television roles , particularly when handling cups or trays of drinks . One of his later television appearances was in The Old Curiosity Shop , a 1979 mini @-@ series based on the novel by Charles Dickens . Around this time , he also voiced the part of Squire <unk> in a radio production of The Adventures of Harry Richmond , which the Daily Telegraph said was " remembered with affection " . He lent his voice to several radio performances , both Shakespearean and modern , including protagonist John Tanner in the five @-@ hour Man and Superman by George Bernard Shaw . 
 = = Writing career = = 
 Shaw wrote Take a Life , his first play , in 1961 . He directed a production of the show at London 's Mermaid Theatre , where he also played the lead role of the Detective . That same year he played two lead roles in George Bernard Shaw plays at the Dublin Theatre Festival : Mrs. Warren 's Profession and Candida . Around this time , he also wrote an outline for a television comedy series about four girls sharing a flat , inspired by his real @-@ life daughter , who was in her early twenties and living in a flat with other girls her age . The series was submitted to the Granada Television company , which expressed interest in the show and said it was one of two under consideration for television . The company ultimately chose the other show , the long @-@ running British soap opera Coronation Street . 
 Shaw agreed to take certain roles only on the condition that he have complete freedom to rewrite his dialogue . When he appeared in It Happened Here , a 1966 World War II film , he wrote many of his own lines , which the filmmakers later said " gave his dialogue an individual slant which enhanced his performance " . He also helped in other aspects of the filmmaking , including casting ; he introduced the filmmakers to Fiona Leland , who would be cast as Shaw 's wife in It Happened Here . He wrote other plays , including The Ship 's Bell , The Cliff Walk , The Glass Maze and Cul de Sac . He also wrote Poems , a collection of his personal poetry , which saw a limited print of 300 editions by publisher Exeter University . 
 Shaw wrote The Christening , his only novel , in 1975 . It centres around Miles Madgwick , who believes that he is bisexual but is too timid to find out through physical intercourse , so he instead describes his most intimate thoughts in his diary . He then meets a married woman named Alice and her son , Rodney ; he comes to identify with Rodney 's childhood innocence , and in Alice sees a symbol both of his mother and a heterosexual lover . Alice starts to tire of her husband and grow fonder of Madgwick , who experiences mixed emotions in his continued interactions with her and Rodney . One night , Rodney stays overnight at Madgwick 's house and , when he takes the boy home in a taxicab , the driver observes their strange behaviour and accuses Madgwick of being a pederast . When Alice asks Madgwick to become the godfather to her new child , the driver threatens to expose Madgwick , creating a conflict between losing his first feelings of intimacy with others or facing humiliation and ridicule at the driver 's exposure . 
 A description in the book cover flap reads , " In this tender , sensitive and blackly comic novel , Sebastian Shaw , the distinguished Shakespearean actor , explores areas of sexual and emotional encounter that are rarely seen and , unfortunately , too rarely understood . " Shaw originally planned to call the novel The Godfather , but later said he was glad he did not due to the popularity of Mario Puzo 's book of that name . He was said to have been working on another novel shortly after The Christening was completed , but no others were ever published . 
 = = Return of the Jedi = = 
 In 1982 , Shaw was chosen for the small but crucial role of redeemed Anakin Skywalker in Return of the Jedi , the third and final film in the original Star Wars trilogy . Although David Prowse played the costumed scenes and James Earl Jones voiced Darth Vader , just as they had in the first two films , Shaw was cast in a single scene with Mark Hamill , during the moment aboard Death Star II when Luke Skywalker unmasks his dying father . Since the scene was unquestionably the emotional climax of the film , the casting crew sought an experienced actor for the role . 
 When Shaw arrived at the set for filming , he ran into his friend Ian McDiarmid , the actor playing Emperor Palpatine . When McDiarmid asked him what he was doing there , Shaw responded , " I don 't know , dear boy , I think it 's something to do with science @-@ fiction . " His presence during the filming was kept secret from all but the minimum cast and crew , and Shaw was contractually obliged not to discuss any film secrets with anyone , even his family . The unmasking scene , directed by Richard Marquand , was filmed in one day and required only a few takes , with no alteration from the original dialogue . When the film was re @-@ released on DVD in 2004 , a few changes were made : the unmasking scene with Hamill remained mostly the same , but Shaw 's eyebrows were digitally removed to tie in with the injuries Anakin Skywalker suffers at the end of Revenge of the Sith . Shaw 's eyes were also digitally coloured to look like those of Hayden Christensen , the actor who played Anakin in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith . 
 Star Wars creator George Lucas personally directed Shaw for his appearance in the final scene of the film , in which he is a Force Ghost of Anakin . Shaw 's image in this scene was replaced with that of Christensen in the 2004 release . This last attempt to tie the prequel and original trilogies together proved to be possibly the most controversial change in the Star Wars re @-@ releases . 
 Although Shaw 's unmasking scene lasted only two minutes and seven seconds and included just 24 words of dialogue spoken by Shaw , he received more fan mail and autograph requests from Return of the Jedi than he had for any role in the rest of his career . He later reflected that he very much enjoyed his experience filming for Return of the Jedi and expressed particular surprise that an action figure was made of him from the film . 
 = = Later career and death = = 
 Shaw remained active in his later years ; along with fellow Royal Shakespeare Company actors Ian Richardson , John Nettles , Martin Best and Ann Firbank , he engaged in discussions and workshops with acting teachers and students in the early 1980s . Although appearances in films became far less common in his later career , he received much acclaim for his performance as the Cold War spy Sharp in Clare Peploe 's High Season at the New York Film Festival in 1987 ; The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune said Shaw played the role with " endearing , sweet gravity " . One of his last performances was in the Christmas season of 1988 and 1989 , when he played the wizard in a stage production of The Wizard of Oz at the Barbican Centre . The Times said audiences were " delighted to recognise his honeyed threats from behind the great carapace that disguised the Wizard of Oz " . Shaw became an honorary life @-@ member at the Garrick Club , which included such past members as writers Charles Dickens , J.M. Barrie , Kingsley Amis and A.A. Milne ; artists Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais ; and composer Edward Elgar . 
 Shaw died of natural causes on 23 December 1994 at age 89 in Brighton , Sussex , England . A memorial service was held 15 February 1995 at St Paul 's , Covent Garden , commonly known as the Actors ' Church due to its long association with the theatre community . Actors Ian Richardson and Ben Kingsley read works by William Shakespeare , stage actress Estelle Kohler read How Do I Love Thee ? by Victorian poetess Elizabeth Barrett Browning , actress Sheila Allen read Life by Welsh poet George Herbert and actor Kenneth Branagh read from the works of Canon Henry Scott Holland . One of Shaw 's own poems , Gemini , was also read . Baritone Stephen Varcoe sang Wie bist du meine Königin by Johannes Brahms , accompanied by Graham Johnson on the piano , and guitarist Martin Best performed and sang his composition of Ariel 's Songs from The Tempest . Shaw was survived by his partner Joan Ingpen , daughter Drusilla MacLeod , sisters Susan Bonner @-@ Morgan and Penelope Harness , and sister @-@ in @-@ law Olga Young .

 = 1850 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1850 Atlantic hurricane season was the most recent season excluded from the scope of the official Atlantic hurricane database . Although meteorological records are sparse and generally incomplete , they indicate that three significant tropical cyclones affected land , each causing some degree of damage . The first system struck North Carolina on July 18 , causing significant damage before battering the Mid @-@ Atlantic states with high tides , strong winds , and heavy rainfall . Torrential rainfall caused river flooding from Baltimore to Philadelphia , particularly along the Schuylkill River , which took the lives of 20 people in various incidents . Strong winds damaged property and public facilities in and around New York City , and damaging floods extended into central and northern New England . Crops and railroad infrastructure suffered throughout the entire region . 
 On August 22 , a strong hurricane impacted Havana , Cuba , destroying fruit trees and disrupting shipping , before making landfall on the Florida Panhandle with an enormous storm surge . Coastal flooding was severe around Apalachicola , and as the storm moved inland , it generated destructive winds across the southeastern United States . Abundant precipitation fell from Georgia through Virginia , causing extensive flooding ; one river swelled over 20 feet ( 6 m ) above its normal height . The storm blew down crops and trees along its course , and toppled a large railroad bridge near Halifax , North Carolina . Offshore , a pilot boat collided with a larger ship in the rough seas and sank . Considered the worst storm in nearly 30 years in the tidewater region of Virginia , the cyclone briefly reentered the Atlantic off New Jersey before making landfall over New England . Strong winds and moderate to heavy rains plagued much of New England on August 24 and 25 . 
 On September 7 and 8 , a hurricane brushed the coastline from New York to Cape Cod with gusty winds and appreciable rainfall , and left many ships in distress . The system later struck Atlantic Canada , likely causing " great loss of property and lives " , though damage reports were limited . Fragmented records exist of other hurricanes , including two which remained over open seas in early September and the middle of October . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 Attempts to catalog Atlantic hurricanes in the first half of the 19th century began as early as 1855 , when Andrés Poey compiled information on just over 400 tropical cyclones from 1493 to 1855 . However , Poey listed only three of the five or more hurricanes that developed in 1850 . In his 1963 book , Early American Hurricanes , 1492 – 1870 , weather researcher David M. Ludlum discusses , in greater detail , three significant tropical cyclones that impacted the United States in 1850 . Unusually , all three heavily impacted the northeastern states ; Ludlum compares the season to 1954 , in which three major tropical systems impacted the Eastern Seaboard . More traditional hurricane targets , such as Florida , were spared the brunt of seasonal tropical cyclone activity in 1850 , while the atmosphere farther north was abnormally tropical . Newark , New Jersey , had its warmest — and one of its rainiest — summers on record at the time , owing to frequent nearby hurricanes and the influx of tropical air . Meteorological reports pertinent to the season were largely lost in a Smithsonian Institution fire in 1856 , limiting what is known about hurricane activity in 1850 . As the season falls outside the scope of the Atlantic hurricane database ( 1851 onward ) and its associated reanalysis project , records are regarded as incomplete . Extant accounts of the storms in 1850 are chiefly based on private weather records and press reports , and only approximate storm tracks are known . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Mid @-@ July = = = 
 The first documented hurricane in 1850 originated in the Caribbean Sea , where it wrecked dozens of ships along the Windward Islands on July 11 and 12 . On July 18 , the storm struck North Carolina from the south as a hurricane of at least Category 1 intensity ( on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ) and proceeded northward . Although the exact point of landfall is unknown , the system is believed to have moved ashore south of Cape Hatteras . Ships just off the state 's coast battled three days of hurricane conditions from July 15 to July 18 . Onshore , " great damage " occurred from Wilmington to Elizabeth City . 
 Intense wave action churned the Chesapeake Bay , while storm @-@ heightened tides up to 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) above normal flooded wharves and coastal communities . The Baltimore area endured persistent gale @-@ force winds accompanied by torrential rainfall . As streams and rivers swelled above their banks , cellars and streets became inundated by floodwaters . Many trees were blown down and numerous poorly built or unfinished buildings were destroyed . The storm cut telegraph communications between Baltimore and surrounding areas . In the countryside , low @-@ lying hay fields were flooded and most of the corn crop was decimated . At Bladensburg , Maryland , a train station and locomotive were washed into an adjacent flooded waterway . Arrivals of ships into port were delayed by the storm , which one captain held to be the worst he had ever observed , and some vessels incurred extensive damage . 
 The storm 's effects quickly spread northward . Winds at Philadelphia began to increase in the morning on July 18 , becoming severe by the evening hours . Air pressure fell to 993 millibars ( 29 @.@ 3 inHg ) early on July 19 as the hurricane 's center passed to the west , and the city received more than 4 inches ( 100 mm ) of rainfall . The storm wrought significant damage throughout the city , including to trees , signs , and structures . A number of houses were demolished , and many more — including a large brick building near Rittenhouse Square — suffered damage . Major freshwater flooding was observed in the area , especially along the Schuylkill River , which rapidly rose to its highest level since 1838 . A large quantity of lumber was swept away , and several docks were submerged . Their " worst apprehensions realized " , hundreds of residents worked hurriedly to mitigate damage from the flooding . Bridges over the river at Phoenixville were washed away , resulting in the deaths of four individuals . A lock of a dam upstream of Phoenixville gave way , destroying a boat and killing its occupants . Four men and a child reportedly drowned on the river 's banks near Conshohocken . Railways were covered with up to 3 feet of water in low @-@ lying spots . Numerous small craft capsized on the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers . Overall , 20 people died in various storm @-@ related tragedies along the Schuylkill . 
 The hurricane took a heavy toll on agriculture in the Mid @-@ Atlantic states . Rampant flooding outside Philadelphia destroyed fruit orchards , and in nearby Burlington , New Jersey , strong winds and heavy rainfall inflicted significant damage to crops on the night of July 18 , leaving entire fields of corn blown down . The Delaware River burst its banks at Burlington , inundating nearby lowlands . Notable flooding also took place along the Lehigh River . Telegraph lines north of Philadelphia were crippled , limiting communications in the storm 's aftermath . Throughout the region , downed trees blocked railways . 
 Hurricane @-@ force gusts buffeted Newark , New Jersey , and rainfall exceeded a weather observer 's rain gauge capacity of 4 @.@ 75 in ( 121 mm ) . Strong winds imperiled New York City late on July 18 into the next morning ; there was widespread tree damage , with branches and leaves littering the ground , and many specimens uprooted or snapped . The storm ruined awnings and tore metal roofs off several buildings . Some ships in New York Harbor were ripped from their anchors and blown aground ; further east , multiple coaster vessels were wrecked along the coast of Long Island . The winds and storm tides destroyed bath houses and other facilities at Coney Island . 
 As the storm tracked northward through central New York State , it produced high southeasterly winds and heavy rainfall across most of New England . At Fort Trumbull along the coast of Connecticut , heavy rainfall starting early on July 19 accumulated to 3 @.@ 24 in ( 82 mm ) . At Hartford , flooding caused about $ 100 @,@ 000 ( 1850 USD ) in losses . <unk> winds peaked at tropical storm @-@ force . Damage to property and crops was confined to western New England , leaving areas such as eastern Massachusetts unscathed . Less substantial rain was reported at Providence , amounting to 1 in ( 25 mm ) . The rain shield extended into far @-@ northern New England , producing 5 in ( 130 mm ) of precipitation at Montpelier , Vermont , and 3 @.@ 23 in ( 82 mm ) at Burlington . The resultant flooding was in some cases the greatest in recent memory . 
 = = = Late August = = = 
 A tropical system first observed near Barbados on August 16 proceeded to affect the Windward Islands before yielding hurricane conditions at Ponce , Puerto Rico , on August 20 . Two days later , the hurricane tracked over western Cuba , causing severe weather conditions around Havana . The storm destroyed large swaths of banana and plantain trees , and all vessels in Havana Harbor dragged anchors at the height of the hurricane . 
 The storm moved north over the eastern Gulf of Mexico , striking the Florida Panhandle between Pensacola and Panama City on August 23 . Extremely high tides bombarded the Apalachicola area , resulting in extensive coastal flooding . The hurricane destroyed wharves and left many ships damaged or foundered . Sea water intrusion inundated warehouses and streets in Apalachicola , and one street was made impassable by strewn debris and fallen trees . Farther east , a bridge over the Wakulla River was washed away by raging floodwaters . A long period of high winds was reported at the state 's capital city of Tallahassee . The storm produced some strong winds in interior Georgia on its way to the Carolinas . The destruction of homes , crops , and trees was reported from Griffin through Augusta . Adverse conditions extended westward to Montgomery , Alabama , where the night of August 23 was marked by high winds and heavy rainfall . 
 <unk> gales had a large impact on shipping interests off North Carolina . Several vessels were imperiled ; in one case a pilot boat capsized after colliding with another ship . In light of this incident , the hurricane is listed in the National Hurricane Center 's contemporary compilation of tropical cyclones that " may have " caused at least 25 fatalities . The storm grounded the schooner H. <unk> near Cape Fear . 
 Gales were reported from Savannah , Georgia , to Wilmington , North Carolina . Near Halifax , North Carolina , the winds toppled a railroad bridge about 450 ft ( 140 m ) long and 60 ft ( 20 m ) high . The storm also ravaged farmland in the area , destroying crops , fences , trees , and structures , and injuring several people . Much damage was reported in the Raleigh area , and many trees in New Bern suffered at least some limb breakage ; several large trees were fully uprooted . The local corn crop — already diminished from the July hurricane — was judged completely lost , though property damage was negligible . Offshore winds from the storm created a negative storm surge on the Neuse River , leaving docks dry for a time . Torrential rains over a large area from Georgia to Virginia triggered severe river flooding . The Dan River , which flows through North Carolina and Virginia , swelled 20 ft ( 6 m ) , amplified to 40 ft ( 12 m ) above normal in narrow channels . In the Carolinas , mills , dams , and roads were washed out , and losses in central North Carolina alone totaled an estimated $ 7 million . 
 Gale @-@ force winds lashed the tidewater region of Virginia in what was considered the worst storm on the lower Chesapeake Bay since the 1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane . A ship called the Osceola lost its wheelhouse to the winds , while onshore , the storm razed crops and a few small structures such as barns and outhouses . Affecting many of the same areas as the July hurricane , the cyclone downed trees in and around Baltimore and caused street flooding in Washington , D.C. , where a railroad bridge was swept away . The storm began to influence the weather at Philadelphia on the night of August 24 . Strong winds out of the north and northeast at Philadelphia and Newark , New Jersey , suggest the center moved off the New Jersey coast and reemerged into the Atlantic . In addition to the gales , more than 3 in ( 75 mm ) of rain fell on Newark on August 25 . 
 Winds at New London , Connecticut , and Providence , Rhode Island , veered from southeast to south , then west , so the storm center likely tracked somewhere over Connecticut . The storm adversely affected shipping on the Long Island Sound , and heavy rain fell across much of New England . Fort Trumbull recorded 4 @.@ 43 in ( 113 mm ) of rain , while 2 @.@ 5 in ( 64 mm ) fell at Providence ; the deluge triggered flash flooding , though few details are known about the extent of the damage . 
 = = = Early September = = = 
 The third and final widely documented hurricane to affect the U.S. East Coast in 1850 remained predominately offshore , but still impacted ships and coastal cities on September 7 and 8 . A vessel about 140 mi ( 230 km ) east of Atlantic City , New Jersey , intercepted the hurricane 's center and recorded a pressure of 988 mbar ( 29 @.@ 18 inHg ) on the night of September 7 . Numerous ships near the Delaware coast were stricken . Gusty winds snapped tree branches in New York City , while Newark received 2 @.@ 6 in ( 66 mm ) of rain as the hurricane brushed the region . The system probably continued toward the northeast , passing south of Nantucket , Massachusetts . There , gale @-@ force winds initially blew out of the southeast before shifting to north midday on September 8 . Similarly , Cape Cod experienced blustery conditions accompanied by heavy rainfall , though damage in eastern New England was generally inconsequential . Providence , Rhode Island , received 2 in ( 51 mm ) of rain . 
 The storm later affected the Canadian Maritimes , causing heavy disruption in Nova Scotia . Downed telegraph wires in the region delayed damage reports until repairs were completed . The cyclone " undoubtedly caused great loss of property and lives along the coast " , according to a report from the telegraph office at Halifax . 
 = = = Other storms = = = 
 A strong squall swept across Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas on June 27 . High winds ripped a ship from its anchor and drove it aground , and at least one other vessel suffered structural damage . Although it is included in the Weather Prediction Center 's publication , Texas Hurricane History , little is known about the nature of the storm . 
 Shipping data indicates a hurricane formed near Cape Verde on September 2 and tracked northward into the northeastern Atlantic over the next week . Andrés Poey listed this system as two distinct cyclones , later confirmed by Chenoweth ( 2006 ) to be a single storm . 
 A final hurricane is believed to have existed over the central Atlantic in mid @-@ October , moving from near 24 @.@ 5 ° N , 47 ° W to 25 @.@ 5 ° N , 41 ° W over the course of four days .

 Edward Jovanovski ( born June 26 , 1976 ) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman . He was born in Windsor , Ontario , and is of Macedonian descent . 
 Jovanovski played major junior ice hockey for two seasons with the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) , earning First All @-@ Star , Second All @-@ Star and All @-@ Rookie Team honours . He was then selected first overall in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft by the Florida Panthers . During his rookie NHL season , he earned All @-@ Rookie Team honours and helped the Panthers advance to the Stanley Cup Finals , where they lost to the Colorado Avalanche . After three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half seasons in Florida , Jovanovski was traded to the Vancouver Canucks in a seven @-@ player deal involving Pavel Bure . During his tenure with Vancouver , he was awarded the Babe Pratt Trophy as the team 's best defenceman three consecutive years . He also led the club 's defencemen in scoring four consecutive years . In July 2006 , Jovanovski became an unrestricted free agent and signed with the Phoenix Coyotes . He led the team 's defencemen in scoring during his first three years with the club . Known as a two @-@ way defenceman , he has recorded three 40 @-@ point and one 50 @-@ point season in the NHL . 
 Internationally , Jovanovski plays for the Canadian national team . A one @-@ time Winter Olympian , he won a gold medal at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City . At the under @-@ 20 level , he won gold at the 1995 World Junior Championship . He went on to play in four Men 's World Championships , winning silver in 2005 and 2008 . He also represented Canada at the 2004 World Cup , playing in one game due to injury in the championship @-@ winning tournament .

 After playing bantam and Junior B in his hometown of Windsor , Jovanovski joined the Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) with the Windsor Spitfires . In his rookie season with the Spitfires , Jovanovski led all team defencemen in scoring , with 50 points in 62 games . In addition to being voted as the Emms Division 's top <unk> by League coaches , he was named to the OHL 's All @-@ Rookie and Second All @-@ Star Teams . That off @-@ season , Jovanovski was selected first overall by the Florida Panthers in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft . He admitted to being surprised at the top selection , as he had not been ranked first at any point in his draft @-@ eligible season . Czech prospect Radek Bonk was ranked first overall by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau , but Panthers President Bill Torrey preferred to select a defenceman over a forward . 
 Following the Draft , the 1994 – 95 NHL season was suspended for three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half months due to a labour dispute between NHL players and owners . Consequently , Jovanovski remained in junior for the beginning of the 1994 – 95 OHL season . When NHL was set to resume play in January 1995 , it was speculated that the Panthers might sign Jovanovski and call him up to the NHL . However , then @-@ Panthers General Manager Bryan Murray announced that Jovanovski would remain with Windsor , citing that he would likely not receive much playing time with the club . He averaged approximately 40 minutes per game with Windsor that season , scoring 23 goals and 65 points over 50 contests . He also added nine points in nine playoff games before Windsor was eliminated . Jovanovski was named to the OHL First All @-@ Star Team . 
 While still with the Spitfires , Jovanovski was charged with sexual assault , along with two of his teammates . The charges were eventually dropped after his lawyer threatened the alleged victim with a lawsuit . 
 = = = Florida Panthers ( 1995 – 1999 ) = = = 
 Following his second major junior season , Jovanovski signed a four @-@ year , $ 5 @.@ 7 million contract with the Panthers in June 1995 . Playing with the club during the subsequent pre @-@ season , he broke his right hand during a fight with Hartford Whalers forward Brendan Shanahan . The injury caused him to miss the first 11 games of the season . After recovering , he scored his first career NHL goal against the Whalers on December 2 , 1995 , a game @-@ winner in a 5 – 3 victory . He finished his rookie season with 10 goals and 21 points over 70 games . During the regular season , he was encouraged by Panthers management to play more conservatively than he was used to in the OHL , focusing on defensive positioning . 
 Ranking fourth in the Eastern Conference going into the 1996 playoffs , Jovanovski helped the Panthers advance to the Stanley Cup Finals . He scored his first career Stanley Cup playoff goal in Game 2 of the first round against Boston Bruins goaltender Craig Billington . Facing the Colorado Avalanche in the Finals , the Panthers were defeated in four @-@ straight games . Jovanovski contributed a goal and nine points in 22 post @-@ season games . It would be his only Stanley Cup Finals appearance . In the off @-@ season , he was named to the NHL All @-@ Rookie Team . He was also nominated for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the League 's rookie of the year , alongside Chicago Blackhawks forward Éric Dazé and Ottawa Senators forward Daniel Alfredsson , who ultimately won the award . 
 On November 23 , 1996 , Jovanovski received a three @-@ game suspension from the NHL without pay . In a game against the Dallas Stars the previous night , he illegally left the penalty box ready to fight any opposing players during a break in play . Later in the season , he suffered a knee injury during a game against the Edmonton Oilers in January 1997 , sidelining him for several weeks . The following month , he was involved in an on @-@ ice altercation with San Jose Sharks forward Bernie Nicholls , resulting in a two @-@ game suspension and the maximum $ 1 @,@ 000 fine for Nicholls for intent to injure . The accumulated injuries and suspensions caused Jovanovski to miss 21 games in his second NHL season . He scored seven goals and 23 points over 61 contests . 
 In 1997 – 98 , Jovanovski appeared in 81 games , recording nine goals and 23 points . With his contract set to expire following the 1998 – 99 season , Jovanovski was beginning to be seen as a disappointment in Florida , failing to improve on his successful rookie year . 
 = = = Vancouver Canucks ( 1999 – 2006 ) = = = 
 On January 17 , 1999 , after three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half seasons with the Panthers , Jovanovski was traded in a seven @-@ player deal to the Vancouver Canucks . He was sent with Dave Gagner , Mike Brown , Kevin Weekes and a first @-@ round draft pick in 2000 ( Nathan Smith ) in exchange for Pavel Bure , Bret Hedican , Brad Ference and a third @-@ round pick in 2000 ( Robert Fried ) . Joining the Canucks in the midst of a rebuilding period for the franchise , Jovanovski quickly established himself as a top defenceman in Vancouver 's lineup . His ability to join the rush as a defenceman complemented the Canucks ' up @-@ tempo style of play . 
 A month following his trade , Jovanovski suffered a broken foot while blocking a shot in a game against the New Jersey Devils on February 9 , 1999 . Later in the season , he was involved in an altercation with Montreal Canadiens forward Shayne Corson . After being high @-@ sticked in the face by Corson , the two players were sent off the ice , at which point Corson entered the Canucks ' dressing room to verbally confront Jovanovski . According to Corson , the feud stemmed from comments Jovanovski had said about his family . As a result of entering the Canucks ' dressing room , the Canadiens forward was later suspended five games by the NHL , in addition to one game for the high @-@ sticking infraction . In 31 games with the Canucks that season , Jovanovski recorded two goals and 11 points . Combined with his games played with the Panthers , he totalled 27 points in 72 games . 
 In his first full season with Vancouver , Jovanovski tallied five goals and 26 points ( first among team defencemen ) over 75 games . He also ranked second among team defencemen in average ice time per game , behind only Mattias Öhlund . The following season , in 2000 – 01 , he led all team defencemen with 12 goals and 47 points over 79 games . He was then named to his first of three consecutive NHL All @-@ Star Games in 2001 .

 = Beauty and the Beast ( 1991 film ) = 
 Beauty and the Beast is a 1991 American animated musical romantic fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures . The 30th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series and the third in the Disney Renaissance period , it is based on the French fairy tale of the same name by Jeanne @-@ Marie Leprince de Beaumont , who was also credited in the English version as well as in the French version , and ideas from the 1946 French film directed by Jean Cocteau . Beauty and the Beast focuses on the relationship between the Beast ( Robby Benson ) , a prince who is magically transformed into a monster as punishment for his arrogance , and Belle ( Paige O 'Hara ) , a beautiful young woman whom he imprisons in his castle . To become a prince again , Beast must win her love in return otherwise he remains a monster forever . The film also features the voices of Richard White , Jerry Orbach , David Ogden Stiers , and Angela Lansbury . 
 Walt Disney first attempted unsuccessfully to adapt Beauty and the Beast into an animated feature film during the 1930s and 1950s . Following the success of The Little Mermaid ( 1989 ) , Disney decided to adapt the fairy tale , which Richard Purdum originally conceived as a non @-@ musical . Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg eventually discontinued the idea and ordered that the film be a musical similar to The Little Mermaid instead . Beauty and the Beast was directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise , with a screenplay by Linda Woolverton story first credited to Roger Allers . Lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken wrote the film 's songs . Ashman , who additionally served as an executive producer on the film , died of AIDS @-@ related complications eight months before the film 's release , and the film was dedicated to his memory . 
 Beauty and the Beast premiered as an unfinished film at the New York Film Festival on September 29 , 1991 , followed by its theatrical release as a completed film at the El Capitan Theatre on November 22 . The film was a box office success , grossing $ 425 million worldwide . Beauty and the Beast received positive reviews ; it won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and became the first animated film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture . It won the Academy Award for Best Original Score and Best Original Song for its title song . In 2002 , Beauty and the Beast was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant " . 
 In April 1994 , Beauty and the Beast became Disney 's first animated film to be adapted into a Broadway musical . The success of the film spawned two direct @-@ to @-@ video follow @-@ ups : Beauty and the Beast : The Enchanted Christmas ( 1997 ) and Beauty and the Beast : Belle 's Magical World ( 1998 ) . This was followed by a spin @-@ off television series , Sing Me a Story with Belle . An IMAX version was released in 2002 that included " Human Again " , a new five @-@ minute musical sequence . After the success of the 3 @-@ D re @-@ release of The Lion King , the film was reissued in 3 @-@ D in 2012 . In 2014 , it was announced that a live @-@ action remake was in the works , and is scheduled for release in March 2017 .

 = = Voice cast = = 
 Paige O 'Hara as Belle – A bibliophilic and beautiful young girl who seeks adventure , and offers her own freedom to the Beast in return for her father 's . In their effort to enhance the character from the original story , the filmmakers felt that Belle should be " unaware " of her own beauty and made her " a little odd . " Wise recalls casting O 'Hara because of a " unique tone " she had , " a little bit of Judy Garland , " after whose appearance Belle was modeled . James Baxter and Mark Henn served as the supervising animators for Belle . 
 Robby Benson as The Beast – A young prince who is transformed into a beast by a beautiful enchantress as punishment for his arrogance . He has the head structure and horns of an American bison , the arms and body of a bear , the ears of a deer , the eyebrows of a gorilla , the jaws , teeth , and mane of a lion , the tusks of a wild boar and the legs and tail of a wolf . Chris Sanders , one of the film 's storyboard artists , drafted the designs for the Beast and came up with designs based on birds , insects , and fish before coming up with something close to the final design . Glen Keane , supervising animator for the Beast , refined the design by going to the zoo and studying the animals on which the Beast was based . Benson commented , " There 's a rage and torment in this character I 've never been asked to use before . " The filmmakers commented that " everybody was big fee @-@ fi @-@ fo @-@ fum and gravelly " while Benson 's voice had the " big voice and the warm , accessible side " and that " you could hear the prince beneath the fur . " 
 Richard White as Gaston – A vain hunter who vies for Belle 's hand in marriage and is determined not to let anyone else win her heart . Gaston 's supervising animator , Andreas Deja , was pressed by Jeffrey Katzenberg to make Gaston handsome in contrast to the traditional appearance of a Disney villain , an assignment he found difficult at first . In the beginning , Gaston is depicted as more of a narcissist than a villain , but later he leads all the villagers to kill the beast , enraged that Belle would love a Beast more than him . 
 Jerry Orbach as Lumière – The kind @-@ hearted but rebellious maître d 'hôtel of the Beast 's castle , who has been transformed into a candlestick . He has a habit of disobeying his master 's strict rules , sometimes causing tension between them , but the Beast often turns to him for advice . He is depicted as flirtatious , as he is frequently seen with the Featherduster and immediately takes a liking to Belle . A running gag throughout the movie is Lumière burning Cogsworth . Nik Ranieri served as the supervising animator for Lumière . 
 David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth – The head of the household staff and Lumière 's best friend , who has been transformed into a clock . He is extremely loyal to the Beast so as to save himself and anyone else any trouble , often leading to friction between himself and Lumière . Will Finn served as the supervising animator for Cogsworth . Stiers also narrates the prologue . 
 Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts – The castle cook , turned into a teapot , who takes a motherly attitude toward Belle . The filmmakers went through several names for Mrs. Potts , such as " Mrs. <unk> , " before Ashman suggested the use of simple and concise names for the household objects . David Pruiksma served as the supervising animator for Mrs. Potts . 
 Bradley Michael Pierce as Chip – Mrs. Potts ' son , who has been turned into a teacup . Originally intended to have only one line , the filmmakers were impressed with Pierce 's performance and expanded the character 's role significantly , eschewing a mute Music Box character . Pruiksma also served as the supervising animator for Chip . 
 Rex Everhart as Maurice – Belle 's inventor father . The citizens call him crazy , but his loyal daughter believes he will be famous one day . Ruben A. Aquino served as the supervising animator for Maurice .

 Hal Smith as Philippe – Belle 's Belgian horse . Russ Edmonds served as the supervising animator for Philippe . 
 Jo Anne Worley as the Wardrobe – The castle 's authority over fashion , and a former opera singer , who has been turned into a wardrobe . The character of Wardrobe was introduced by visual development person Sue C. Nichols to the then entirely male cast of servants , and was originally a more integral character named " Madame <unk> . " Wardrobe is known as " Madame de la Grande <unk> " ( Madame Big Mouth ) in the stage adaptation of the film , and is the only major enchanted object character we do not see the human form of in the film . Tony Anselmo served as the supervising animator for the Wardrobe . 
 Mary Kay Bergman and Kath Soucie as the <unk> – A trio of village maidens who constantly fawn over Gaston , known as the " Silly Girls " in the stage adaptation .

 After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 , Walt Disney sought out other stories to adapt into feature films , with Beauty and the Beast being among the stories he considered . Attempts to develop the Beauty and the Beast story into a film were made in the 1930s and 1950s , but were ultimately given up because it " proved to be a challenge " for the story team . Peter M. Nichols states Disney may later have been discouraged by Jean Cocteau having already done his version . 
 Decades later , during the production of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1987 , the Disney studio resurrected Beauty and the Beast as a project for the satellite animation studio it had set up in London , England to work on Roger Rabbit . Richard Williams , who had directed the animated portions of Roger Rabbit , was approached to direct , but declined in favor of continuing work on his long @-@ gestating project The Thief and the Cobbler . In his place , Williams recommended his colleague , English animation director Richard Purdum , and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non @-@ musical version of Beauty and the Beast set in 19th century France . At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner , Beauty and the Beast became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter . This was an unusual production move for an animated film , which is traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in scripted form . Linda Woolverton wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began , and worked with the story team to retool and develop the film . 
 = = = Script rewrite and <unk> = = = 
 Upon seeing the initial storyboard reels in 1989 , Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered that the film be scrapped and started over from scratch . A few months after starting anew , Purdum resigned as director . The studio had approached Ron Clements and John Musker to direct the film but turned down the offer saying they were " tired " after just having finished directing Disney 's recent success The Little Mermaid . Disney then hired first @-@ time feature directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale . Wise and Trousdale had previously directed the animated sections of Cranium Command , a short film for a Disney EPCOT theme park attraction . In addition , Katzenberg asked songwriters Howard Ashman and Alan Menken , who had written the song score for The Little Mermaid to turn Beauty and the Beast into a Broadway @-@ style musical film in the same vein as Mermaid . Ashman , who at the time had learned he was dying of complications from AIDS , had been working with Disney on a pet project of his , Aladdin , and only reluctantly agreed to join the struggling production team . To accommodate Ashman 's failing health , pre @-@ production of Beauty and the Beast was moved from London to the Residence Inn in Fishkill , New York , close to Ashman 's New York City home . Here , Ashman and Menken joined Wise , Trousdale , Hahn , and Woolverton in retooling the film 's script . Since the original story had only two major characters , the filmmakers enhanced them , added new characters in the form of enchanted household items who " add warmth and comedy to a gloomy story " and guide the audience through the film , and added a " real villain " in the form of Gaston . 
 These ideas were somewhat similar to elements of the 1946 French film version of Beauty and the Beast , which introduced the character of <unk> , an oafish suitor somewhat similar to Gaston as well as inanimate objects coming to life in the Beast 's castle . The animated objects were , however , given distinct personalities in the Disney version . By early 1990 , Katzenberg had approved the revised script , and storyboarding began again . The production flew story artists back and forth between California and New York for storyboard approvals from Ashman , though the team was not told the reason why . 
 = = = Casting and recording = = = 
 Disney had originally considered casting Jodi Benson from The Little Mermaid as Belle . They eventually decided upon Broadway actress and singer Paige O 'Hara in favor of having a heroine who sounded " more like a woman than a girl " . According to co @-@ director Kirk Wise , O 'Hara was given the role because she " had a unique quality , a tone she would hit that made her special " , reminiscent to that of American actress and singer Judy Garland . O 'Hara , who , after reading about the film in The New York Times , competed for the role against 500 hopefuls , believes the fact that lyricist Howard Ashman admired her cast recording of the musical Show Boat proved integral in her being cast . 
 = = = Animation = = = 
 Production of Beauty and the Beast was to be completed on a compressed timeline of two years rather than the traditional four @-@ year Disney Feature Animation production schedule ; this was due to the loss of production time spent developing the earlier Purdum version of the film . Most of the production was done at the main Feature Animation studio , housed in the Air Way facility in Glendale , California . A smaller team at the Disney @-@ MGM Studios theme park in Lake Buena Vista , Florida assisted the California team on several scenes , particularly the " Be Our Guest " number . 
 Beauty and the Beast was the second film , after The Rescuers Down Under , produced using CAPS ( Computer Animation Production System ) , a digital scanning , ink , paint , and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar . The software allowed for a wider range of colors , as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters , techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s . CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects : placing characters and / or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards / away from the camera on the Z @-@ axis to give the illusion of depth , as well as altering the focus of each layer . 
 In addition , CAPS allowed easier combination of hand @-@ drawn art with computer @-@ generated imagery , which before had to be plotted to animation paper and then <unk> and painted traditionally . This technique was put to significant use during the " Beauty and the Beast " waltz sequence , in which Belle and Beast dance through a computer @-@ generated ballroom as the camera dollies around them in simulated 3D space . The filmmakers had originally decided against the use of computers in favor of traditional animation , but later , when the technology had improved , decided it could be used for the one scene in the ballroom . The success of the ballroom sequence helped convince studio executives to further invest in computer animation . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Ashman and Menken wrote the Beauty song score during the pre @-@ production process in Fishkill , the opening operetta @-@ styled " Belle " being their first composition for the film . Other songs included " Be Our Guest , " sung ( in its original version ) to Maurice by the objects when he becomes the first visitor to eat at the castle in a decade , " Gaston , " a solo for the swaggering villain , " Human Again , " a song describing Belle and Beast 's growing love from the objects ' perspective , the love ballad " Beauty and the Beast , " and the climactic " The Mob Song . " As story and song development came to a close , full production began in Burbank while voice and song recording began in New York City . The Beauty songs were mostly recorded live with the orchestra and the voice cast performing simultaneously rather than overdubbed separately , in order to give the songs a cast album @-@ like " energy " the filmmakers and songwriters desired . 
 During the course of production , many changes were made to the structure of the film , necessitating the replacement and re @-@ purposing of songs . After screening a mostly animated version of the " Be Our Guest " sequence , story artist Bruce Woodside suggested that the objects should be singing the song to Belle rather than her father . Wise and Trousdale agreed , and the sequence and song were retooled to replace Maurice with Belle . The film 's title song went through a noted bit of uncertainty during production . Originally conceived as a rock @-@ oriented song , it was changed to a slow , romantic ballad . Howard Ashman and Alan Menken asked Angela Lansbury to perform the song , but she didn 't think her voice was suited for the melody . When she voiced her doubts , Menken and Ashman asked her for at least one take , and told her to perform the song as she saw fit . Lansbury reportedly reduced everyone in the studio to tears with her rendition , nailing the song in the one take asked of her . This version went on to win the Oscar for Best Original Song . " Human Again " was dropped from the film before animation began , as its lyrics caused story problems about the timeline over which the story takes place . This required Ashman and Menken to write a new song in its place . " Something There , " in which Belle and Beast sing ( via voiceover ) of their growing fondness for each other , was composed late in production and inserted into the script in place of " Human Again . " 
 Menken would later revise " Human Again " for inclusion in the 1994 Broadway stage version of Beauty and the Beast , and another revised version of the song was added to the film itself in a new sequence created for the film 's Special Edition re @-@ release in 2002 . Ashman died of AIDS @-@ related complications on March 14 , 1991 , eight months prior to the release of the film . He never saw the finished film , though he did get to see it in its unfinished format . Ashman 's work on Aladdin was completed by another lyricist , Tim Rice . Before Ashman 's death , members of the film 's production team visited him after the film 's well @-@ received first screening , with Don Hahn commenting that " the film would be a great success . Who 'd have thought it ? " , to which Ashman replied with " I would . " A tribute to the lyricist was included at the end of the credits crawl : " To our friend , Howard , who gave a mermaid her voice , and a beast his soul . We will be forever grateful . Howard Ashman : 1950 – 1991 . " A pop version of the " Beauty and the Beast " theme , performed by Céline Dion and Peabo Bryson over the end credits , was released as a commercial single from the film 's soundtrack , supported with a music video . The Dion / Bryson version of " Beauty and the Beast " became an international pop hit and performed considerably well on charts around the world . The song became Dion 's second single to land within the top @-@ 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 , peaking at number nine . The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary chart . In Canada , " Beauty and the Beast " peaked at number two . Outside of North America , the song peaked within the top ten in New Zealand and the United Kingdom , while peaking within the top twenty in Australia , Netherlands and Ireland . The song sold over a million copies worldwide . This version of the song was also nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year at the Grammys , and it won the Grammy for Dion and Bryson for Best Pop Duo / Group Vocal Performance .

 In a first @-@ time accomplishment for The Walt Disney Company , an unfinished version of Beauty and the Beast was shown at the New York Film Festival on September 29 , 1991 . The film was deemed a " work in progress " because roughly only 70 % of the animation had been completed ; storyboards and pencil tests were used in replacement of the remaining 30 % . Additionally , certain segments of the film that had already been finished were reverted to previous stages of completion . At the end of the screening , Beauty and the Beast received a 10 @-@ minute long standing ovation from the film festival audience . The completed film would also be screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival . The finished film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on November 13 , 1991 , and went into wide release through Walt Disney Pictures on November 22 .

 Review aggregation Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 93 % with an average of 8 @.@ 4 based on reviews from 103 critics . The website 's general consensus reads , " Enchanting , sweepingly romantic , and featuring plenty of wonderful musical numbers , Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney 's most elegant animated offerings . " CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare " A + " grade . 
 Awarding the film a perfect score of four stars , Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times compared Beauty and the Beast positively to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio , writing , " Beauty and the Beast reaches back to an older and healthier Hollywood tradition in which the best writers , musicians and filmmakers are gathered for a project on the assumption that a family audience deserves great entertainment , too . " In 2001 Ebert again gave the IMAX re @-@ release a full 4 out of 4 stars . James Berardinelli of ReelViews rated the film similarly while hailing it as " the finest animated movie ever made " , writing , " Beauty and the Beast attains a nearly @-@ perfect mix of romance , music , invention , and animation . " The use of computer animation , particularly in the ballroom sequence , was singled out in several reviews as one of the film 's highlights . Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review , calling the film " A delightfully satisfying modern fable , a near @-@ masterpiece that draws on the sublime traditions of the past while remaining completely in sync with the sensibility of its time . " Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a positive review , saying " It is a surprise , in a time of sequels and retreads , that the new film is so fresh and altogether triumphant in its own right . " Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars , saying " Beauty and the Beast is certainly adequate holiday entertainment for children and their more indulgent parents ..... But the film has little of the technical facility , vivid characterization and emotional impact of Disney past . " 
 Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film four out of five stars , saying " It 's not an especially scary movie , but right from the start , you can tell that this Beauty and the Beast has a beauty of a bite . " John Hartl of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four , saying " It 's exceptionally difficult to make an audience care for animated characters unless they 're mermaids or anthropomorphized animals or insects , yet the Disney animators , with a big assist from the vocal talents of a superb cast , have pulled it off . " Gene Siskel also of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars , saying " Beauty and the Beast is one of the <unk> most entertaining films for both adults and children . " Michael Sragow of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review , saying " It 's got storytelling vigor and clarity , bright , eclectic animation , and a frisky musical wit . " Eric <unk> writes in his book Animating Culture that the studio was trying to make up for earlier gender stereotypes with this film . <unk> also states that , in the way it has been viewed as bringing together traditional fairy tales and feminism as well as computer and traditional animation , the film 's " greatness could be proved in terms of technology narrative or even politics " . 
 Animation historian Michael Barrier wrote that Belle " becomes a sort of intellectual less by actually reading books , it seems , than by hanging out with them " , but says that the film comes closer than other " Disney @-@ studio " films to " accepting challenges of the kind that the finest Walt Disney features met " . David Whitley writes in The Idea of Nature in Disney Animation that Belle is different from earlier Disney heroines in that she is mostly free from the burdens of domestic housework , although her role is somewhat undefined in the same way that " contemporary culture now requires most adolescent girls to contribute little in the way of domestic work before they leave home and have to take on the fraught , multiple responsibilities of the working mother " . Whitley also notes other themes and modern influences , such as the film 's critical view of Gaston 's chauvinism and attitude towards nature , the cyborg @-@ like servants , and the father 's role as an inventor rather than a merchant . IGN named Beauty and the Beast as the greatest animated film of all time , directly ahead of WALL @-@ E , The Incredibles , Toy Story 2 , and The Iron Giant .

 According to an article in The Houston Chronicle , " The catalyst for Disney 's braving the stage was an article by The New York Times theater critic Frank Rich that praised Beauty and the Beast as 1991 's best musical .... Theatre Under The Stars executive director Frank Young had been trying to get Disney interested in a stage version of Beauty about the same time Eisner and Katzenberg were mulling over Rich 's column . But Young couldn 't seem to get in touch with the right person in the Disney empire . Nothing happened till the Disney execs started to pursue the project from their end .... When they asked George Ives , the head of Actors Equity on the West Coast , which Los Angeles theater would be the best venue for launching a new musical , Ives said the best theater for that purpose would be TUTS . Not long after that , Disney 's Don Frantz and Bettina Buckley contacted Young , and the partnership was under way .

 = Henry VIII of England = 
 Henry VIII ( 28 June 1491 – 28 January 1547 ) was King of England from 21 April 1509 until his death . He was the first English King of Ireland , and continued the nominal claim by English monarchs to the Kingdom of France . Henry was the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty , succeeding his father , Henry VII . 
 Henry is known for his consequential role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church , besides his six marriages and many extramarital affairs , as well as his effort to obtain an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon , which led to conflict with the Pope . His disagreements with the Pope led Henry to separate the Church of England from papal authority , with himself as king and as the Supreme Head of the Church of England ; the disputes also led to the Dissolution of the Monasteries . His principal dispute was with papal authority rather than with doctrinal matters , and he remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings despite his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church . Henry oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . He is also well known for a long personal rivalry with both Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , with whom he frequently warred . 
 Domestically , Henry is known for his radical changes to the English Constitution , ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings to England . Besides asserting the sovereign 's supremacy over the Church of England , thus initiating the English Reformation , he greatly expanded royal power . Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent , and those accused were often executed without a formal trial , by means of bills of attainder . He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers , some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour . People such as Thomas Wolsey , Thomas More , Thomas Cromwell , Richard Rich , and Thomas Cranmer figured prominently in Henry 's administration . He was an extravagant <unk> and used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament to convert money into royal revenue that was formerly paid to Rome . Despite the influx of money from these sources , Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly continental wars . 
 His contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive , educated , and accomplished king , and he has been described as " one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne " . Besides ruling with considerable power , he was also an author and composer . His desire to provide England with a male heir stemmed partly from personal vanity and partly from his belief that a daughter would be unable to consolidate Tudor power and maintain the fragile peace that existed following the Wars of the Roses . This led to the two things for which Henry is most remembered : his six marriages and his break with the Pope ( who would not allow an annulment of Henry 's first marriage ) . As he aged , Henry became severely obese and his health suffered , contributing to his death in 1547 . He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful , egotistical , harsh , and insecure king . He was succeeded by his son Edward VI . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Born 28 June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich , London , Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York . Of the young Henry 's six siblings , only three – Arthur , Prince of Wales ; Margaret ; and Mary – survived infancy . He was baptised by Richard Fox , the Bishop of Exeter , at a church of the Observant Franciscans close to the palace . In 1493 , at the age of two , Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports . He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three , and was inducted into the Order of the Bath soon after . The day after the ceremony he was created Duke of York and a month or so later made Warden of the Scottish Marches . In May 1495 , he was appointed to the Order of the Garter . Henry was given a first @-@ rate education from leading tutors , becoming fluent in Latin and French , and learning at least some Italian . Not much is known about his early life – save for his appointments – because he was not expected to become king . In November 1501 , Henry also played a considerable part in the ceremonies surrounding the marriage of his brother , Prince Arthur , to Catherine of Aragon , the youngest surviving child of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile . As Duke of York , Henry used the arms of his father as king , differenced by a label of three points ermine . 
 In 1502 , Arthur died at the age of 15 of sweating sickness , just 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine . Arthur 's death thrust all his duties upon his younger brother , the 10 @-@ year @-@ old Henry . After a little debate , Henry became the new Duke of Cornwall in October 1502 , and the new Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in February 1503 . Henry VII gave the boy few tasks . Young Henry was strictly supervised and did not appear in public . As a result , the young Henry would later ascend the throne " untrained in the exacting art of kingship . " 
 Henry VII renewed his efforts to seal a marital alliance between England and Spain , by offering his second son in marriage to Arthur 's widow Catherine . Both Isabella and Henry VII were keen on the idea , which had arisen very shortly after Arthur 's death . On 23 June 1503 , a treaty was signed for their marriage , and they were betrothed two days later . A papal dispensation was only needed for the " impediment of public honesty " if the marriage had not been consummated as Catherine and her <unk> claimed , but Henry VII and the Spanish ambassador set out instead to obtain a dispensation for " affinity " , which took account of the possibility of consummation . The young Henry 's age , only eleven , prevented cohabitation . Isabella 's death in 1504 , and the ensuing problems of succession in Castile , complicated matters . Her father preferred her to stay in England , but Henry VII 's relations with Ferdinand had deteriorated . Catherine was therefore left in limbo for some time , culminating in Prince Henry 's rejection of the marriage as soon he was able , at the age of 14 . Ferdinand 's solution was to make his daughter ambassador , allowing her to stay in England indefinitely . Devout , she began to believe that it was God 's will that she marry the prince despite his opposition .

Soon after his father 's burial on 10 May , Henry suddenly declared that he would indeed marry Catherine , leaving unresolved several issues concerning the papal dispensation and a missing part of the marriage portion . The new king maintained that it had been his father 's dying wish that he marry Catherine . Whether or not this was true , it was certainly convenient . Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I had been attempting to marry his granddaughter ( and Catherine 's niece ) Eleanor to Henry ; she had now been jilted . Henry 's wedding to Catherine was kept low @-@ key and was held at the friar 's church in Greenwich on 11 June 1509 . On 23 June 1509 , Henry led the now 23 @-@ year @-@ old Catherine from the Tower of London to Westminster Abbey for their coronation , which took place the following day . It was a grand affair : the king 's passage was lined with tapestries and laid with fine cloth . Following the ceremony , there was a grand banquet in Westminster Hall . As Catherine wrote to her father , " our time is spent in continuous festival " . 
 Two days after Henry 's coronation , he arrested his father 's two most unpopular ministers , Sir Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley . They were charged with high treason and were executed in 1510 . Historian Ian Crofton has maintained that such executions would become Henry 's primary tactic for dealing with those who stood in his way ; the two executions were certainly not the last . Henry also returned to the public some of the money supposedly extorted by the two ministers . By contrast , Henry 's view of the House of York – potential rival claimants for the throne – was more moderate than his father 's had been . Several who had been imprisoned by his father , including the Marquess of Dorset , were pardoned . Others ( most notably Edmund de la Pole ) went unreconciled ; de la Pole was eventually beheaded in 1513 , an execution prompted by his brother Richard siding against the king . 
 Soon after , Catherine conceived , but the child , a girl , was stillborn on 31 January 1510 . About four months later , Catherine again became pregnant . On New Year 's Day 1511 , the child – Henry – was born . After the grief of losing their first child , the couple were pleased to have a boy and there were festivities to celebrate , including a jousting tournament . However , the child died seven weeks later . Catherine had two stillborn sons in 1514 and 1515 , but gave birth in February 1516 to a girl , Mary . Relations between Henry and Catherine had been strained , but they eased slightly after Mary 's birth . 
 Although Henry 's marriage to Catherine has since been described as " unusually good " , it is known that Henry took mistresses . It was revealed in 1510 that Henry had been conducting an affair with one of the sisters of Edward Stafford , 3rd Duke of Buckingham , either Elizabeth or Anne Hastings , Countess of Huntingdon . The most significant mistress for about three years , starting in 1516 , was Elizabeth Blount . Blount is one of only two completely undisputed mistresses , few for a virile young king . Exactly how many Henry had is disputed : David Loades believes Henry had mistresses " only to a very limited extent " , whilst Alison Weir believes there were numerous other affairs . Catherine did not protest , and in 1518 fell pregnant again with another girl , who was also stillborn . Blount gave birth in June 1519 to Henry 's illegitimate son , Henry FitzRoy . The young boy was made Duke of Richmond in June 1525 in what some thought was one step on the path to his eventual legitimisation . In 1533 , FitzRoy married Mary Howard , but died childless three years later . At the time of Richmond 's death in June 1536 , Parliament was enacting the Second Succession Act , which could have allowed him to become king . 
 = = France and the Habsburgs = = 
 In 1510 , France , with a fragile alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in the League of Cambrai , was winning a war against Venice . Henry renewed his father 's friendship with Louis XII of France , an issue that divided his council . Certainly war with the combined might of the two powers would have been exceedingly difficult . Shortly thereafter , however , Henry also signed a pact with Ferdinand . After the creation of the anti @-@ French Holy League by Pope Julius II in October 1511 , Henry , following Ferdinand 's lead , brought England into the League . An initial joint Anglo @-@ Spanish attack on Aquitaine was planned for the spring to recover it for England . It appeared to be the start of making Henry 's dreams of ruling France a reality . The attack , following a formal declaration of war in April 1512 , was not led by Henry personally and was a considerable failure ; Ferdinand used it simply to further his own ends , and it strained the Anglo @-@ Spanish alliance . Nevertheless , the French were pushed out of Italy soon after , and the alliance survived , with both parties keen to win further victories over the French . Henry then pulled off a diplomatic coup by convincing the Emperor to join the Holy League . Remarkably , Henry had also secured the promised title of " Most Christian King of France " , and possibly coronation by the Pope himself in Paris , if only Louis could be defeated . 
 On 30 June 1513 , Henry invaded France , and his troops defeated a French army at the Battle of the Spurs – a relatively minor result , but one which was seized on by the English for propaganda purposes . Soon after , the English took Thérouanne and handed it over to Maximillian ; Tournai , a more significant settlement , followed . Henry had led the army personally , complete with large entourage . His absence from the country , however , had prompted his brother @-@ in @-@ law , James IV of Scotland , to invade England at the behest of Louis . Nevertheless , the English army , overseen by Queen Catherine , decisively defeated the Scots at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513 . Among the dead was the Scottish king , thus ending Scotland 's brief involvement in the war . These campaigns had given Henry a taste of the military success he so desired . However , despite initial indications that he would pursue a 1514 campaign , Henry decided against such a move . He had been supporting Ferdinand and Maximilian financially during the campaign but had got back little ; England 's own coffers were now empty . With the replacement of Julius by Pope Leo X , who was inclined to negotiate for peace with France , Henry signed his own treaty with Louis : his sister Mary would become Louis ' wife , having previously been pledged to the younger Charles , and peace was secured for eight years , a remarkably long time . 
 Following the deaths of his grandfathers , Ferdinand and Maximilian , in 1516 and 1519 respectively , Charles of Austria ascended the thrones of both Spain and the Holy Roman Empire . Likewise , Francis I became king of France on Louis ' death in 1515 , leaving three relatively young rulers and an opportunity for a clean slate . Cardinal Thomas Wolsey 's careful diplomacy had resulted in the Treaty of London in 1518 , aimed at uniting the kingdoms of western Europe in the wake of a new Ottoman threat , and it seemed that peace might be secured . Henry met Francis I on 7 June 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold near Calais for a fortnight of lavish entertainment . Both hoped for friendly relations in place of the wars of the previous decade . The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of a renewal of the Treaty of London , however , and conflict was inevitable . Henry had more in common with Charles , whom he met once before and once after Francis . Charles brought the Empire into war with France in 1521 ; Henry offered to mediate , but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles . He still clung to his previous aim of restoring English lands in France , but also to securing an alliance with Burgundy and the continuing support of Charles . A small English attack in the north of France made up little ground . Charles defeated and captured Francis at Pavia , and could dictate peace ; but he believed he owed Henry nothing . Sensing this , Henry decided to take England out of the war before his ally , signing the Treaty of the More on 30 August 1525 . 
 = = Annulment from Catherine = = 
 During his first marriage to Catherine of Aragon , Henry conducted an affair with Mary Boleyn , Catherine 's lady @-@ in @-@ waiting . There has been speculation that Mary 's two children , Henry and Catherine Carey , were fathered by Henry , but this has never been proved and the King never acknowledged them as he did Henry FitzRoy . In 1525 , as Henry grew more impatient with Catherine 's inability to produce the male heir he desired , he became enamoured of Mary 's sister , Anne , then a charismatic young woman of 25 in the Queen 's entourage . Anne , however , resisted his attempts to seduce her , and refused to become his mistress as her sister Mary Boleyn had . It was in this context that Henry considered his three options for finding a dynastic successor and hence resolving what came to be described at court as the King 's " great matter " . These options were legitimising Henry FitzRoy , which would take the intervention of the pope and would be open to challenge ; marrying off Mary as soon as possible and hoping for a grandson to inherit directly , but Mary was considered unlikely to conceive before Henry 's death ; or somehow rejecting Catherine and marrying someone else of child @-@ bearing age . Probably seeing the possibility of marrying Anne , the third was ultimately the most attractive possibility to the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Henry , and it soon became the King 's absorbing desire to annul his marriage to the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old Catherine . It was a decision that would see Henry reject papal authority and initiate the English Reformation . 
 Henry 's precise motivations and intentions over the coming years are not widely agreed on . Henry himself , at least in the early part of his reign , was a devout and well @-@ informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication <unk> Septem <unk> ( " Defence of the Seven Sacraments " ) earned him the title of Fidei Defensor ( Defender of the Faith ) from Pope Leo X. The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy , albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms . It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage . Certainly , by 1527 he had convinced himself that in marrying Catherine , his brother 's wife , he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20 : 21 , an impediment the Pope had never had ( he now believed ) the authority to dispense with . It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled , forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack . In going public , all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet were lost . Henry sent his secretary , William Knight , to appeal directly to the Holy See by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull . Knight was unsuccessful ; the Pope could not be misled so easily . 
 Other missions concentrated on arranging an ecclesiastical court to meet in England , with a representative from Clement VII . Though Clement agreed to the creation of such a court , he never had any intention of empowering his legate , Lorenzo Campeggio , to decide in Henry 's favour . This bias was perhaps the result of pressure from Charles V , Catherine 's nephew , though it is not clear how far this influenced either Campeggio or the Pope . After less than two months of hearing evidence , Clement called the case back to Rome in July 1529 , from which it was clear that it would never re @-@ emerge . With the chance for an annulment lost and England 's place in Europe forfeit , Wolsey bore the blame . He was charged with praemunire in October 1529 and his fall from grace was " sudden and total " . Briefly reconciled with Henry ( and officially pardoned ) in the first half of 1530 , he was charged once more in November 1530 , this time for treason , but died while awaiting trial . After a short period in which Henry took government upon his own shoulders , Sir Thomas More took on the role of Lord Chancellor and chief minister . Intelligent and able , but also a devout Catholic and opponent of the annulment , More initially cooperated with the king 's new policy , denouncing Wolsey in Parliament . 
 A year later , Catherine was banished from court , and her rooms were given to Anne . Anne was an unusually educated and intellectual woman for her time , and was keenly absorbed and engaged with the ideas of the Protestant Reformers , though the extent to which she herself was a committed Protestant is much debated . When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died , Anne 's influence and the need to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position . This was approved by the Pope , unaware of the King 's nascent plans for the Church . 
 = = Marriage to Anne Boleyn = = 
 In the winter of 1532 , Henry met with Francis I at Calais and enlisted the support of the French king for his new marriage . Immediately upon returning to Dover in England , Henry , now 41 , and Anne , now 32 , went through a secret wedding service . She soon became pregnant , and there was a second wedding service in London on 25 January 1533 . On 23 May 1533 , Cranmer , sitting in judgment at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of the king 's marriage to Catherine of Aragon , declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void . Five days later , on 28 May 1533 , Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be valid . Catherine was formally stripped of her title as queen , becoming instead " princess dowager " as the widow of Arthur . In her place , Anne was crowned queen consort on 1 June 1533 . The queen gave birth to a daughter slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533 . The child was christened Elizabeth , in honour of Henry 's mother , Elizabeth of York . 
 Following the marriage , there was a period of consolidation taking the form of a series of statutes of the Reformation Parliament aimed at finding solutions to any remaining issues , whilst protecting the new reforms from challenge , convincing the public of their legitimacy , and exposing and dealing with opponents . Although the canon law was dealt with at length by Cranmer and others , these acts were advanced by Thomas Cromwell , Thomas Audley and the Duke of Norfolk and indeed by Henry himself . With this process complete , in May 1532 More resigned as Lord Chancellor , leaving Cromwell as Henry 's chief minister . With the Act of Succession 1533 , Catherine 's daughter , Mary , was declared illegitimate ; Henry 's marriage to Anne was declared legitimate ; and Anne 's issue was decided to be next in the line of succession . With the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 , Parliament also recognised the King 's status as head of the church in England and , with the Act in Restraint of Appeals in 1532 , abolished the right of appeal to Rome . It was only then that Pope Clement took the step of excommunicating Henry and Thomas Cranmer , although the excommunication was not made official until some time later . 
 The king and queen were not pleased with married life . The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection , but Anne refused to play the submissive role expected of her . The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover made her too independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and it made her many enemies . For his part , Henry disliked Anne 's constant irritability and violent temper . After a false pregnancy or miscarriage in 1534 , he saw her failure to give him a son as a betrayal . As early as Christmas 1534 , Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the chances of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine . Henry is traditionally believed to have had an affair with Margaret ( " Madge " ) Shelton in 1535 , although historian Antonia Fraser argues that Henry in fact had an affair with her sister Mary Shelton . 
 Opposition to Henry 's religious policies was quickly suppressed in England . A number of dissenting monks , including the first Carthusian Martyrs , were executed and many more pilloried . The most prominent resisters included John Fisher , Bishop of Rochester , and Sir Thomas More , both of whom refused to take the oath to the King . Neither Henry nor Cromwell sought to have the men executed ; rather , they hoped that the two might change their minds and save themselves . Fisher openly rejected Henry as supreme head of the Church , but More was careful to avoid openly breaking the Treason Act , which ( unlike later acts ) did not forbid mere silence . Both men were subsequently convicted of high treason , however – More on the evidence of a single conversation with Richard Rich , the Solicitor General . Both were duly executed in the summer of 1535 . 
 These <unk> , as well as the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act of 1536 , in turn contributed to more general resistance to Henry 's reforms , most notably in the Pilgrimage of Grace , a large uprising in northern England in October 1536 . Some 20 @,@ 000 to 40 @,@ 000 rebels were led by Robert Aske , together with parts of the northern nobility . Henry VIII promised the rebels he would pardon them and thanked them for raising the issues . Aske told the rebels they had been successful and they could disperse and go home . Henry saw the rebels as traitors and did not feel obliged to keep his promises with them , so when further violence occurred after Henry 's offer of a pardon he was quick to break his promise of clemency . The leaders , including Aske , were arrested and executed for treason . In total , about 200 rebels were executed , and the disturbances ended . 
 = = Execution of Anne Boleyn = = 
 On 8 January 1536 news reached the king and the queen that Catherine of Aragon had died . Henry called for public displays of joy regarding Catherine 's death . The queen was pregnant again , and she was aware of the consequences if she failed to give birth to a son . Later that month , the King was unhorsed in a tournament and was badly injured and it seemed for a time that the king 's life was in danger . When news of this accident reached the queen , she was sent into shock and miscarried a male child that was about 15 weeks old , on the day of Catherine 's funeral , 29 January 1536 . For most observers , this personal loss was the beginning of the end of the royal marriage . Given the king 's desperate desire for a son , the sequence of Anne 's pregnancies has attracted much interest . Author Mike Ashley speculated that Anne had two stillborn children after Elizabeth 's birth and before the birth of the male child she miscarried in 1536 . Most sources attest only to the birth of Elizabeth in September 1533 , a possible miscarriage in the summer of 1534 , and the miscarriage of a male child , of almost four months gestation , in January 1536 . 
 Although the Boleyn family still held important positions on the Privy Council , Anne had many enemies , including the Duke of Suffolk . Even her own uncle , the Duke of Norfolk , had come to resent her attitude to her power . The <unk> preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally , and the King 's favour had swung towards the latter ( partly because of Cromwell ) , damaging the family 's influence . Also opposed to Anne were supporters of reconciliation with Princess Mary ( among them the former supporters of Catherine ) , who had reached maturity . A second annulment was now a real possibility , although it is commonly believed that it was Cromwell 's anti @-@ Boleyn influence that led opponents to look for a way of having her executed . 
 Anne 's downfall came shortly after she had recovered from her final miscarriage . Whether it was primarily the result of allegations of conspiracy , adultery , or witchcraft remains a matter of debate among historians . Early signs of a fall from grace included the King 's new mistress , the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Jane Seymour , being moved into new quarters , and Anne 's brother , George Boleyn , being refused the Order of the Garter , which was instead given to Nicholas Carew . Between 30 April and 2 May , five men , including Anne 's brother , were arrested on charges of treasonable adultery and accused of having sexual relationships with the queen . Anne was also arrested , accused of treasonous adultery and incest . Although the evidence against them was unconvincing , the accused were found guilty and condemned to death . George Boleyn and the other accused men were executed on 17 May 1536 . At 8 am on 19 May 1536 , Anne , age 36 , was executed on Tower Green . 
 = = Marriage to Jane Seymour ; domestic and foreign affairs = = 
 The day after Anne 's execution in 1536 the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Henry became engaged to Seymour , who had been one of the Queen 's ladies @-@ in @-@ waiting . They were married ten days later . On 12 October 1537 , Jane gave birth to a son , Prince Edward , the future Edward VI . The birth was difficult , and the queen died on 24 October 1537 from an infection and was buried in Windsor . The euphoria that had accompanied Edward 's birth became sorrow , but it was only over time that Henry came to long for his wife . At the time , Henry recovered quickly from the shock . Measures were immediately put in place to find another wife for Henry , which , at the insistence of Cromwell and the court , were focused on the European continent . 
 With Charles V distracted by the internal politics of his many kingdoms and external threats , and Henry and Francis on relatively good terms , domestic and not foreign policy issues had been Henry 's priority in the first half of the 1530s . In 1536 , for example , Henry granted his assent to the Laws in Wales Act 1535 , which legally annexed Wales , uniting England and Wales into a single nation . This was followed by the Second Succession Act ( the Act of Succession 1536 ) , which declared Henry 's children by Jane to be next in the line of succession and declared both Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate , thus excluding them from the throne . The king was also granted the power to further determine the line of succession in his will , should he have no further issue . However , when Charles and Francis made peace in January 1539 , Henry became increasingly paranoid , perhaps as a result of receiving a constant list of threats to the kingdom ( real or imaginary , minor , or serious ) supplied by Cromwell in his role as spymaster . Enriched by the dissolution of the monasteries , Henry used some of his financial reserves to build a series of coastal defences and set some aside for use in the event of a Franco @-@ German invasion . 
 = = Marriage to Anne of Cleves = = 
 Having considered the matter , Cromwell , now Earl of Essex , suggested Anne , the 25 @-@ year @-@ old sister of the Duke of Cleves , who was seen as an important ally in case of a Roman Catholic attack on England , for the duke fell between Lutheranism and Catholicism . Hans Holbein the Younger was dispatched to Cleves to paint a portrait of Anne for the king . Despite speculation that Holbein painted her in an overly flattering light , it is more likely that the portrait was accurate ; Holbein remained in favour at court . After seeing Holbein 's portrait , and urged on by the complimentary description of Anne given by his courtiers , the 49 @-@ year @-@ old king agreed to wed Anne . However , it was not long before Henry wished to annul the marriage so he could marry another . Anne did not argue , and confirmed that the marriage had never been consummated . Anne 's previous betrothal to the Duke of Lorraine 's son provided further grounds for the annulment . The marriage was subsequently dissolved , and Anne received the title of " The King 's Sister " , two houses and a generous allowance . It was soon clear that Henry had fallen for the 17 @-@ year @-@ old Catherine Howard , the Duke of Norfolk 's niece , the politics of which worried Cromwell , for Norfolk was a political opponent . 
 Shortly after , the religious reformers ( and protégés of Cromwell ) Robert Barnes , William Jerome and Thomas Garret were burned as heretics . Cromwell , meanwhile , fell out of favour although it is unclear exactly why , for there is little evidence of differences of domestic or foreign policy . Despite his role , he was never formally accused of being responsible for Henry 's failed marriage . Cromwell was now surrounded by enemies at court , with Norfolk also able to draw on his niece 's position . Cromwell was charged with treason , selling export licences , granting passports , and drawing up commissions without permission , and may also have been blamed for the failure of the foreign policy that accompanied the attempted marriage to Anne . He was subsequently attainted and beheaded . 
 = = Marriage to Catherine Howard = = 
 On 28 July 1540 ( the same day Cromwell was executed ) , Henry married the young Catherine Howard , a first cousin and lady @-@ in @-@ waiting of Anne Boleyn . He was absolutely delighted with his new queen , and awarded her the lands of Cromwell and a vast array of jewellery . Soon after the marriage , however , Queen Catherine had an affair with the courtier Thomas Culpeper . She also employed Francis Dereham , who had previously been informally engaged to her and had an affair with her prior to her marriage , as her secretary . The court was informed of her affair with Dereham whilst Henry was away ; they dispatched Thomas Cranmer to investigate , who brought evidence of Queen Catherine 's previous affair with Dereham to the king 's notice . Though Henry originally refused to believe the allegations , Dereham confessed . It took another meeting of the council , however , before Henry believed the accusations against Dereham and went into a rage , blaming the council before consoling himself in hunting . When questioned , the queen could have admitted a prior contract to marry Dereham , which would have made her subsequent marriage to Henry invalid , but she instead claimed that Dereham had forced her to enter into an adulterous relationship . Dereham , meanwhile , exposed Queen Catherine 's relationship with Culpeper . Culpeper and Dereham were both executed , and Catherine too was beheaded on 13 February 1542 . 
 = = Shrines destroyed and monasteries dissolved = = 
 In 1538 , the chief minister T. Cromwell pursued an extensive campaign against what is termed " idolatry " by the followers of the old religion , culminating in September with the dismantling of the shrine of St. Thomas Becket at Canterbury . As a consequence , the king was excommunicated by the Pope Paul III on 17 December of the same year . In 1540 , Henry sanctioned the complete destruction of shrines to saints . In 1542 , England 's remaining monasteries were all dissolved , and their property transferred to the Crown . Abbots and priors lost their seats in the House of Lords ; only archbishops and bishops remained . Consequently , the Lords Spiritual – as members of the clergy with seats in the House of Lords were known – were for the first time outnumbered by the Lords Temporal . 
 = = Second invasion of France and the " Rough Wooing " of Scotland = = 
 The 1539 alliance between Francis and Charles had soured , eventually degenerating into renewed war . With Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn dead , relations between Charles and Henry improved considerably , and Henry concluded a secret alliance with the Emperor and decided to enter the Italian War in favour of his new ally . An invasion of France was planned for 1543 . In preparation for it , Henry moved to eliminate the potential threat of Scotland under the youthful James V. Victory would continue the Reformation in Scotland , which was still Catholic , and Henry hoped to unite the crowns of England and Scotland by marriage of James ' daughter , the future Mary , Queen of Scots , to his son Edward . Henry made war on Scotland for several years in pursuit of this goal , a campaign dubbed by Victorian chroniclers as " the Rough Wooing " . 
 The Scots were defeated at Battle of Solway Moss on 24 November 1542 , and James died on 15 December . The Scottish Regent Arran agreed to the marriage in the Treaty of Greenwich on 1 July 1543 . 
 Despite the success with Scotland , Henry hesitated to invade France , annoying Charles . Henry finally went to France in June 1544 with a two @-@ pronged attack . One force under Norfolk ineffectively besieged Montreuil . The other , under Suffolk , laid siege to Boulogne . Henry later took personal command , and Boulogne fell on 18 September 1544 . However , Henry had refused Charles ' request to march against Paris . Charles ' own campaign fizzled , and he made peace with France that same day . Henry was left alone against France , unable to make peace . Francis attempted to invade England in the summer of 1545 , but reached only the Isle of Wight before being repulsed . Out of money , France and England signed the Treaty of Camp on 7 June 1546 . Henry secured Boulogne for eight years . The city was then to be returned to France for 2 million crowns ( £ 750 @,@ 000 ) . Henry needed the money ; the 1544 campaign had cost £ 650 @,@ 000 , and England was once again bankrupt . 
 Meanwhile , though Henry still clung to the Treaty of Greenwich , the Scots repudiated it in December 1543 . Henry launched another war on Scotland , sending an army to burn Edinburgh and lay waste to the country . The Scots would not submit , though . Defeat at Ancrum Moor prompted a second invasion force . This war was nominally ended by the Treaty of Camp , although unrest continued in Scotland , including French and English interventions , up to Henry 's death . 
 = = Marriage to Catherine Parr = = 
 Henry married his last wife , the wealthy widow Catherine Parr , in July 1543 . A reformer at heart , she argued with Henry over religion . Ultimately , Henry remained committed to an idiosyncratic mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism ; the reactionary mood which had gained ground following the fall of Cromwell had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it . Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters Mary and Elizabeth . In 1543 , an Act of Parliament put the daughters back in the line of succession after Edward , Prince of Wales . The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will . 
 = = Physical decline = = 
 Late in life , Henry became obese , with a waist measurement of 54 inches ( 140 cm ) , and had to be moved about with the help of mechanical inventions . He was covered with painful , pus @-@ filled boils and possibly suffered from gout . His obesity and other medical problems can be traced from the jousting accident in 1536 , in which he suffered a leg wound . The accident re @-@ opened and aggravated a previous injury he had sustained years earlier , to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat . The wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated , thus preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed . The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry 's mood swings , which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament . 
 The theory that Henry suffered from syphilis has been dismissed by most historians . A more recent theory suggests that Henry 's medical symptoms are characteristic of untreated type 2 diabetes . Alternatively , his wives ' pattern of pregnancies and his mental deterioration have led some to suggest that the king may have been Kell positive and suffered from McLeod syndrome . According to another study , Henry VIII 's history and body morphology may have been the result of traumatic brain injury after his 1536 jousting accident , which in turn led to a neuroendocrine cause of his obesity . This analysis identifies growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) as the source for his increased <unk> but also significant behavioural changes noted in his later years , including his multiple marriages . 
 = = Death and burial = = 
 Henry 's obesity hastened his death at the age of 55 , which occurred on 28 January 1547 in the Palace of Whitehall , on what would have been his father 's 90th birthday . He allegedly uttered his last words : " Monks ! Monks ! Monks ! " perhaps in reference to the monks he caused to be evicted during the Dissolution of the Monasteries . 
 On 14 February 1547 Henry 's coffin lay overnight at Syon Monastery , en route for burial in St George 's Chapel , Windsor . Twelve years before in 1535 a Franciscan friar named William Peyto ( or Peto , <unk> ) ( died 1558 or 1559 ) , had preached before the King at Greenwich Palace " that God 's judgements were ready to fall upon his head and that dogs would lick his blood , as they had done to Ahab " , whose infamy rests upon 1 Kings 16 : 33 : " And Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him " . The prophecy was said to have been fulfilled during this night at Syon , when some " corrupted matter of a bloody colour " fell from the coffin to the floor . 
 Henry VIII was interred in St George 's Chapel in Windsor Castle , next to Jane Seymour . Over a hundred years later , King Charles I ( 1625 – 1649 ) was buried in the same vault . 
 = = Succession = = 
 After his death , Henry 's only legitimate son , Edward , inherited the Crown , becoming Edward VI ( 1547 – 1553 ) . Since Edward was then only nine years old , he could not exercise actual power . Rather , Henry 's will designated 16 executors to serve on a council of regency until Edward reached the age of 18 . The executors chose Edward Seymour , 1st Earl of Hertford , Jane Seymour 's elder brother , to be Lord Protector of the Realm . If Edward went childless , the throne was to pass to Mary , Henry VIII 's daughter by Catherine of Aragon , and her heirs . If Mary 's issue failed , the crown was to go to Elizabeth , Henry 's daughter by Anne Boleyn , and her heirs . Finally , if Elizabeth 's line became extinct , the crown was to be inherited by the descendants of Henry VIII 's deceased younger sister , Queen Mary of France , the Greys . The descendants of Henry 's sister Margaret – the Stuarts , rulers of Scotland – were thereby excluded from the succession . This final provision failed when James VI of Scotland became James I of England upon Elizabeth 's death . 
 = = Public image = = 
 Henry cultivated the image of a Renaissance man , and his court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess , epitomised by the Field of the Cloth of Gold . He scouted the country for choirboys , taking some directly from Wolsey 's choir , and introduced Renaissance music into court . Musicians included Benedict de <unk> , Richard Sampson , Ambrose Lupo , and Venetian organist Dionisio Memo . 
 Henry himself kept a considerable collection of instruments ; he was skilled on the lute , could play the organ , and was a talented player of the virginals . He could also sight read music and sing well . He was an accomplished musician , author , and poet ; his best known piece of music is " Pastime with Good Company " ( " The <unk> Ballade " ) . He is often reputed to have written " Greensleeves " but probably did not . 
 He was an avid gambler and dice player , and excelled at sports , especially jousting , hunting , and real tennis . He was known for his strong defence of conventional Christian piety . The King was involved in the original construction and improvement of several significant buildings , including Nonsuch Palace , King 's College Chapel , Cambridge and Westminster Abbey in London . Many of the existing buildings Henry improved were properties confiscated from Wolsey , such as Christ Church , Oxford ; Hampton Court Palace ; the Palace of Whitehall ; and Trinity College , Cambridge . 
 Henry was an intellectual . The first English king with a modern humanist education , he read and wrote English , French and Latin , and was thoroughly at home in his well @-@ stocked library . He personally annotated many books and wrote and published one of his own . To promote the public support for the reformation of the church , Henry had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared . For example , Richard Sampson 's Oratio ( 1534 ) was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome . At the popular level , theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices : the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils , while the glorious king was hailed as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith . Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power . 
 A large well @-@ built athlete ( over 6 feet [ 1 @.@ 8 m ] tall and strong and broad in proportion ) , Henry excelled at jousting and hunting . More than pastimes , they were political devices that served multiple goals , from enhancing his athletic royal image to impressing foreign emissaries and rulers , to conveying Henry 's ability to suppress any rebellion . Thus he arranged a jousting tournament at Greenwich in 1517 , where he wore gilded armour , gilded horse trappings , and outfits of velvet , satin and cloth of gold dripping with pearls and jewels . It suitably impressed foreign ambassadors , one of whom wrote home that , " The wealth and civilisation of the world are here , and those who call the English barbarians appear to me to render themselves such " . Henry finally retired from jousting in 1536 after a heavy fall from his horse left him unconscious for two hours , but he continued to sponsor two lavish tournaments a year . He then started adding weight and lost the trim , athletic figure that had made him so handsome ; Henry 's courtiers began dressing in heavily padded clothes to emulate – and flatter – their increasingly stout monarch . Towards the end of his reign his health rapidly declined . 
 = = Government = = 
 The power of Tudor monarchs , including Henry , was ' whole ' and ' entire ' , ruling , as they claimed , by the grace of God alone . The crown could also rely on the exclusive use of those functions that constituted the royal prerogative . These included acts of diplomacy ( including royal marriages ) , declarations of war , management of the coinage , the issue of royal pardons and the power to summon and dissolve parliament as and when required . Nevertheless , as evident during Henry 's break with Rome , the monarch worked within established limits , whether legal or financial , that forced him to work closely with both the nobility and parliament ( representing the gentry ) . In practice , Tudor monarchs used patronage to maintain a royal court that included formal institutions such as the Privy Council as well as more informal advisers and confidants . Both the rise and fall of court nobles could be swift : although the often @-@ quoted figure of 72 @,@ 000 executions during his reign is inflated , Henry did undoubtedly execute at will , burning or beheading two of his wives , twenty peers , four leading public servants , six close attendants and friends , one cardinal ( John Fisher ) and numerous abbots . Among those who were in favour at any given point in Henry 's reign , one could usually be identified as a chief minister , though one of the enduring debates in the historiography of the period has been the extent to which those chief ministers controlled Henry rather than vice versa . In particular , historian G. R. Elton has argued that one such minister , Thomas Cromwell , led a " Tudor revolution in government " quite independent of the king , whom Elton presented as an opportunistic , essentially lazy participant in the nitty @-@ gritty of politics . Where Henry did intervene personally in the running of the country , Elton argued , he mostly did so to its detriment . The prominence and influence of faction in Henry 's court is similarly discussed in the context of at least five episodes of Henry 's reign , including the downfall of Anne Boleyn . 
 From 1514 to 1529 , however , it was Thomas Wolsey ( 1473 – 1530 ) , a cardinal of the established Church , who oversaw domestic and foreign policy for the young king from his position as Lord Chancellor . Wolsey centralised the national government and extended the jurisdiction of the conciliar courts , particularly the Star Chamber . The Star Chamber 's overall structure remained unchanged , but Wolsey used it to provide for much @-@ needed reform of the criminal law . The power of the court itself did not outlive Wolsey , however , since no serious administrative reform was undertaken and its role was eventually devolved to the localities . Wolsey helped fill the gap left by Henry 's declining participation in government ( particularly in comparison to his father ) but did so mostly by imposing himself in the King 's place . His use of these courts to pursue personal grievances , and particularly to treat delinquents as if mere examples of a whole class worthy of punishment , angered the rich , who were annoyed as well by his enormous wealth and ostentatious living . Following Wolsey 's downfall , Henry took full control of his government , although at court numerous complex factions continued to try to ruin and destroy each other . 
 Thomas Cromwell ( c . 1485 – 1540 ) also came to define Henry 's government . Returning to England from the continent in 1514 or 1515 , he soon entered Wolsey 's service . He turned to law , also picking up a good knowledge of the Bible , and was admitted to Gray 's Inn in 1524 . He became Wolsey 's " man of all work " . Cromwell , driven in part by his religious beliefs , attempted to reform the body politic of the English government through discussion and consent , and through the vehicle of continuity and not outward change . He was seen by many people as the man they wanted to bring about their shared aims , including Thomas Audley . By 1531 , Cromwell and those associated with him were already responsible for the drafting of much legislation . Cromwell 's first office was that of the master of the King 's jewels in 1532 , from which he began to invigorate the government finances . By this point , Cromwell 's power as an efficient administrator in a Council full of politicians exceeded what Wolsey had achieved . Cromwell did much work through his many offices to remove the tasks of government from the Royal Household ( and ideologically from the personal body of the King ) and into a public state . He did so , however , in a haphazard fashion that left several remnants , not least because he needed to retain Henry 's support , his own power , and the possibility of actually achieving the plan he set out . Cromwell made the various income streams put in place by Henry VII more formal and assigned largely autonomous bodies for their administration . The role of the King 's Council was transferred to a reformed Privy Council , much smaller and more efficient than its predecessor . A difference emerged between the financial health of the king , and that of the country , although Cromwell 's fall undermined much of his bureaucracy , which required his hand to keep order among the many new bodies and prevent profligate spending which strained relations as well as finances . Cromwell 's reforms ground to a halt in 1539 , the initiative lost , and he failed to secure the passage of an enabling act , the Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539 . He too was executed , on 28 July 1540 . 
 = = = Finances = = = 
 Henry inherited a vast fortune and a prosperous economy from his father Henry VII who had been frugal and careful with money . This fortune was estimated to £ 1 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 ( £ 375 million by today 's standards ) . However , by comparison , the reign of Henry was a near @-@ disaster in financial terms . Although he further augmented his royal treasury through the seizure of church lands , Henry 's heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy . 
 Much of this wealth was spent by Henry on maintaining his court and household , including many of the building works he undertook on royal palaces . Henry hung 2 @,@ 000 tapestries in his palaces by comparison , James V of Scotland hung just 200 . He took pride in showing off his collection of weapons , which included exotic archery equipment , 2 @,@ 250 pieces of land ordnance and 6 @,@ 500 handguns . Tudor monarchs had to fund all the expenses of government out of their own income . This income came from the Crown lands that Henry owned as well as from customs duties like tonnage and poundage , granted by parliament to the king for life . During Henry 's reign the revenues of the Crown remained constant ( around £ 100 @,@ 000 ) , but were eroded by inflation and rising prices brought about by war . Indeed , it was war and Henry 's dynastic ambitions in Europe that meant that the surplus he had inherited from his father was exhausted by the mid @-@ 1520s . Whereas Henry VII had not involved Parliament in his affairs very much , Henry VIII had to turn to Parliament during his reign for money , in particular for grants of subsidies to fund his wars . The Dissolution of the Monasteries provided a means to replenish the treasury and as a result the Crown took possession of monastic lands worth £ 120 @,@ 000 ( £ 36 million ) a year . The Crown had profited a small amount in 1526 when Wolsey had put England onto a gold , rather than silver , standard , and had debased the currency slightly . Cromwell debased the currency more significantly , starting in Ireland in 1540 . The English pound halved in value against the Flemish pound between 1540 and 1551 as a result . The nominal profit made was significant , helping to bring income and expenditure together , but it had a catastrophic effect on the overall economy of the country . In part , it helped to bring about a period of very high inflation from 1544 onwards . 
 = = = Reformation = = = 
 Henry is generally credited with initiating the English Reformation – the process of transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one – though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed , and the precise narrative not widely agreed . Certainly , in 1527 , Henry , until then an observant and well @-@ informed Catholic , appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine . No annulment was immediately forthcoming , the result in part of Charles V 's control of the Papacy . The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry 's rejection of papal supremacy ( which he had previously defended ) , though as historian A. F. Pollard has argued , even if Henry had not needed an annulment , Henry may have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons . 
 In any case , between 1532 and 1537 , Henry instituted a number of statutes that dealt with the relationship between king and pope and hence the structure of the nascent Church of England . These included the Statute in Restraint of Appeals ( passed 1533 ) , which extended the charge of praemunire against all who introduced papal bulls into England , potentially exposing them to the death penalty if found guilty . Other acts included the Supplication against the Ordinaries and the Submission of the Clergy , which recognised Royal Supremacy over the church . The Ecclesiastical Appointments Act 1534 required the clergy to elect bishops nominated by the Sovereign . The Act of Supremacy in 1534 declared that the King was " the only Supreme Head in Earth of the Church of England " and the <unk> Act 1534 made it high treason , punishable by death , to refuse the Oath of Supremacy acknowledging the King as such . Similarly , following the passage of the Act of Succession 1533 , all adults in the Kingdom were required to acknowledge the Act 's provisions ( declaring Henry 's marriage to Anne legitimate and his marriage to Catherine illegitimate ) by oath ; those who refused were subject to imprisonment for life , and any publisher or printer of any literature alleging that the marriage to Anne was invalid subject to the death penalty . Finally , the Peter 's Pence Act was passed , and it reiterated that England had " no superior under God , but only your Grace " and that Henry 's " imperial crown " had been diminished by " the unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and exactions " of the Pope . The King had much support from the Church under Cranmer . 
 Henry , to Thomas Cromwell 's annoyance , insisted on parliamentary time to discuss questions of faith , which he achieved through the Duke of Norfolk . This led to the passing of the Act of Six Articles , whereby six major questions were all answered by asserting the religious orthodoxy , thus restraining the reform movement in England . It was followed by the beginnings of a reformed liturgy and of the Book of Common Prayer , which would take until 1549 to complete . The victory won by religious conservatives did not convert into much change in personnel , however , and Cranmer remained in his position . Overall , the rest of Henry 's reign saw a subtle movement away from religious orthodoxy , helped in part by the deaths of prominent figures from before the break with Rome , especially the executions of Thomas More and John Fisher in 1535 for refusing to renounce papal authority . Henry established a new political theology of obedience to the crown that was continued for the next decade . It reflected Martin Luther 's new interpretation of the fourth commandment ( " Honour thy father and mother " ) , brought to England by William Tyndale . The founding of royal authority on the Ten Commandments was another important shift : reformers within the Church utilised the Commandments ' emphasis on faith and the word of God , while conservatives emphasised the need for dedication to God and doing good . The reformers ' efforts lay behind the publication of the Great Bible in 1539 in English . Protestant Reformers still faced persecution , particularly over objections to Henry 's annulment . Many fled abroad , including the influential Tyndale , who was eventually executed and his body burned at Henry 's behest . 
 When taxes once payable to Rome were transferred to the Crown , Cromwell saw the need to assess the taxable value of the Church 's extensive holdings as they stood in 1535 . The result was an extensive compendium , the Valor Ecclesiasticus . In September of the same year , Cromwell commissioned a more general visitation of religious institutions , to be undertaken by four appointee visitors . The visitation focussed almost exclusively on the country 's religious houses , with largely negative conclusions . In addition to reporting back to Cromwell , the visitors made the lives of the monks more difficult by enforcing strict behavioural standards . The result was to encourage self @-@ dissolution . In any case , the evidence gathered by Cromwell led swiftly to the beginning of the state @-@ enforced dissolution of the monasteries with all religious houses worth less than £ 200 vested by statute in the crown in January 1536 . After a short pause , surviving religious houses were transferred one by one to the Crown and onto new owners , and the dissolution confirmed by a further statute in 1539 . By January 1540 no such houses remained : some 800 had been dissolved . The process had been efficient , with minimal resistance , and brought the crown some £ 90 @,@ 000 a year . The extent to which the dissolution of all houses was planned from the start is debated by historians ; there is some evidence that major houses were originally intended only to be reformed . Cromwell 's actions transferred a fifth of England 's landed wealth to new hands . The programme was designed primarily to create a landed gentry beholden to the crown , which would use the lands much more efficiently . Although little opposition to the supremacy could be found in England 's religious houses , they had links to the international church and were an obstacle to further religious reform . 
 Response to the reforms was mixed . The religious houses had been the only support of the impoverished , and the reforms alienated much of the population outside London , helping to provoke the great northern rising of 1536 – 1537 , known as the Pilgrimage of Grace . Elsewhere the changes were accepted and welcomed , and those who clung to Catholic rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy . They would re @-@ emerge in the reign of Henry 's daughter Mary ( 1553 – 1558 ) . 
 = = = Military = = = 
 Apart from permanent garrisons at Berwick , Calais , and Carlisle , England 's standing army numbered only a few hundred men . This was increased only slightly by Henry . Henry 's invasion force of 1513 , some 30 @,@ 000 men , was composed of <unk> and longbowmen , at a time when the other European nations were moving to hand guns and pikemen . The difference in capability was at this stage not significant , however , and Henry 's forces had new armour and weaponry . They were also supported by battlefield artillery , a relatively new invention , and several large and expensive siege guns . The invasion force of 1544 was similarly well @-@ equipped and organised , although command on the battlefield was laid with the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk , which in the case of the latter produced disastrous results at Montreuil . 
 Henry is traditionally cited as one of the founders of the Royal Navy . Technologically , Henry invested in large cannon for his warships , an idea that had taken hold in other countries , to replace the smaller serpentines in use . He also flirted with designing ships personally – although his contribution to larger vessels , if any , is not known , it is believed that he influenced the design of rowbarges and similar galleys . Henry was also responsible for the creation of a permanent navy , with the supporting anchorages and dockyards . Tactically , Henry 's reign saw the Navy move away from boarding tactics to employ gunnery instead . The Navy was enlarged up to fifty ships ( the Mary Rose was one of them ) , and Henry was responsible for the establishment of the " council for marine causes " to specifically oversee all the maintenance and operation of the Navy , becoming the basis for the later Admiralty . 
 Henry 's break with Rome incurred the threat of a large @-@ scale French or Spanish invasion . To guard against this , in 1538 , he began to build a chain of expensive , state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art defences , along Britain 's southern and eastern coasts from Kent to Cornwall , largely built of material gained from the demolition of the monasteries . These were known as Henry VIII 's Device Forts . He also strengthened existing coastal defence fortresses such as Dover Castle and , at Dover , Moat Bulwark and <unk> Fort , which he personally visited for a few months to supervise . Wolsey had many years before conducted the censuses required for an overhaul of the system of militia , but no reform came of it . Under Cromwell , in 1538 – 9 , the shire musters were overhauled , but Cromwell 's work served most to demonstrate quite how inadequate they were in organisation . The building works , including that at Berwick , along with the reform of the militias and musters , were eventually finished under Queen Mary . 
 = = = Ireland = = = 
 At the beginning of Henry 's reign , Ireland was effectively divided into three zones : the Pale , where English rule was unchallenged ; Leinster and Munster , the so @-@ called " obedient land " of Anglo @-@ Irish peers ; and the Gaelic Connaught and Ulster , with merely nominal English rule . Until 1513 , Henry continued the policy of his father , to allow Irish lords to rule in the king 's name and accept steep divisions between the communities . However , upon the death of the 8th Earl of Kildare , governor of Ireland , fractious Irish politics combined with a more ambitious Henry to cause trouble . When Thomas Butler , 7th Earl of Ormond died , Henry recognised one successor for Ormond 's English , Welsh and Scottish lands , whilst in Ireland another took control . Kildare 's successor , the 9th Earl , was replaced as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by Thomas Howard , Earl of Surrey in 1520 . Surrey 's ambitious aims were costly , but ineffective ; English rule became trapped between winning the Irish lords over with diplomacy , as favoured by Henry and Wolsey , and a sweeping military occupation as proposed by Surrey . Surrey was recalled in 1521 , with Piers Butler – one of claimants to the Earldom of Ormond – appointed in his place . Butler proved unable to control opposition , including that of Kildare . Kildare was appointed chief governor in 1524 , resuming his dispute with Butler , which had before been in a lull . Meanwhile , the Earl of Desmond , an Anglo @-@ Irish peer , had turned his support to Richard de la Pole as pretender to the English throne ; when in 1528 Kildare failed to take suitable actions against him , Kildare was once again removed from his post . 
 The Desmond situation was resolved on his death in 1529 , which was followed by a period of uncertainty . This was effectively ended with the appointment of Henry FitzRoy , Duke of Richmond and the king 's son , as lord lieutenant . Richmond had never before visited Ireland , his appointment a break with past policy . For a time it looked as if peace might be restored with the return of Kildare to Ireland to manage the tribes , but the effect was limited and the Irish parliament soon rendered ineffective . Ireland began to receive the attention of Cromwell , who had supporters of Ormond and Desmond promoted . Kildare , on the other hand , was summoned to London ; after some hesitation , he departed for London in 1534 , where he would face charges of treason . His son , Thomas , Lord Offaly was more forthright , denouncing the king and leading a " Catholic crusade " against the king , who was by this time mired in marital problems . Offaly had the Archbishop of Dublin murdered , and besieged Dublin . Offaly led a mixture of Pale gentry and Irish tribes , although he failed to secure the support of Lord Darcy , a sympathiser , or Charles V. What was effectively a civil war was ended with the intervention of 2 @,@ 000 English troops – a large army by Irish standards – and the execution of Offaly ( his father was already dead ) and his uncles . 
 Although the Offaly revolt was followed by a determination to rule Ireland more closely , Henry was wary of drawn @-@ out conflict with the tribes , and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace , their land protected from English expansion . The man to lead this effort was Sir Antony St Leger , as Lord Deputy of Ireland , who would remain into the post past Henry 's death . Until the break with Rome , it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere fiefdom to the English king , so in 1541 Henry asserted England 's claim to the Kingdom of Ireland free from the Papal overlordship . This change did , however , also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion : the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King , before being returned as fiefdoms . The incentive to comply with Henry 's request was an accompanying barony , and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords , which was to run in parallel with England 's . The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement , because the chieftain did not have the required rights ; this made progress tortuous , and the plan was abandoned in 1543 , not to be replaced . 
 = = Historiography = = 
 The complexities and sheer scale of Henry 's legacy ensured that , in the words of Betteridge and Freeman , " throughout the centuries [ since his death ] , Henry has been praised and reviled , but he has never been ignored " . A particular focus of modern historiography has been the extent to which the events of Henry 's life ( including his marriages , foreign policy and religious changes ) were the result of his own initiative and , if they were , whether they were the result of opportunism or of a principled undertaking by Henry . The traditional interpretation of those events was provided by historian A.F. Pollard , who in 1902 presented his own , largely positive , view of the king , " laud [ ing him ] as the king and statesman who , whatever his personal failings , led England down the road to parliamentary democracy and empire " . Pollard 's interpretation , which was broadly comparable to 17th century publications of Lord Herbert of Cherbury and his contemporaries , remained the dominant interpretation of Henry 's life until the publication of the doctoral thesis of G. R. Elton in 1953 . That thesis , entitled " The Tudor Revolution in Government " , maintained Pollard 's positive interpretation of the Henrician period as a whole , but reinterpreted Henry himself as a follower rather than a leader . For Elton , it was Cromwell and not Henry who undertook the changes in government – Henry was shrewd , but lacked the vision to follow a complex plan through . Henry was little more , in other words , than an " ego @-@ centric monstrosity " whose reign " owed its successes and virtues to better and greater men about him ; most of its horrors and failures sprang more directly from [ the king ] " . 
 Although the central tenets of Elton 's thesis have now been all but abandoned , it has consistently provided the starting point for much later work , including that of J. J. Scarisbrick , his student . Scarisbrick largely kept Elton 's regard for Cromwell 's abilities , but returned agency to Henry , who Scarisbrick considered to have ultimately directed and shaped policy . For Scarisbrick , Henry was a formidable , captivating man who " wore regality with a splendid conviction " . The effect of endowing Henry with this ability , however , was largely negative in Scarisbrick 's eyes : to Scarisbrick the Henrician period was one of upheaval and destruction and those in charge worthy of blame more than praise . Even among more recent biographers , including David Loades , David Starkey and John Guy , there has ultimately been little consensus on the extent to which Henry was responsible for the changes he oversaw or the correct assessment of those he did bring about . 
 This lack of clarity about Henry 's control over events has contributed to the variation in the qualities ascribed to him : religious conservative or dangerous radical ; lover of beauty or brutal destroyer of priceless artefacts ; friend and patron or betrayer of those around him ; chivalry incarnate or ruthless chauvinist . One traditional approach , favoured by Starkey and others , is to divide Henry 's reign into two halves , the first Henry being dominated by positive qualities ( politically inclusive , pious , athletic but also intellectual ) who presided over a period of stability and calm , and the latter a " hulking tyrant " who presided over a period of dramatic , sometimes whimsical , change . Other writers have tried to merge Henry 's disparate personality into a single whole ; Lacey Baldwin Smith , for example , considered him an egotistical borderline neurotic given to great fits of temper and deep and dangerous suspicions , with a mechanical and conventional , but deeply held piety , and having at best a mediocre intellect . 
 = = Style and arms = = 
 Many changes were made to the royal style during his reign . Henry originally used the style " Henry the Eighth , by the Grace of God , King of England , France and Lord of Ireland " . In 1521 , pursuant to a grant from Pope Leo X rewarding Henry for his Defence of the Seven Sacraments , the royal style became " Henry the Eighth , by the Grace of God , King of England and France , Defender of the Faith and Lord of Ireland " . Following Henry 's excommunication , Pope Paul III rescinded the grant of the title " Defender of the Faith " , but an Act of Parliament declared that it remained valid ; and it continues in royal usage to the present day . Henry 's motto was " Coeur Loyal " ( " true heart " ) , and he had this embroidered on his clothes in the form of a heart symbol and with the word " loyal " . His emblem was the Tudor rose and the Beaufort portcullis . As king , Henry 's arms were the same as those used by his predecessors since Henry IV : Quarterly , Azure three fleurs @-@ de @-@ lys Or ( for France ) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or ( for England ) . 
 In 1535 , Henry added the " supremacy phrase " to the royal style , which became " Henry the Eighth , by the Grace of God , King of England and France , Defender of the Faith , Lord of Ireland and of the Church of England in Earth Supreme Head " . In 1536 , the phrase " of the Church of England " changed to " of the Church of England and also of Ireland " . In 1541 , Henry had the Irish Parliament change the title " Lord of Ireland " to " King of Ireland " with the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 , after being advised that many Irish people regarded the Pope as the true head of their country , with the Lord acting as a mere representative . The reason the Irish regarded the Pope as their overlord was that Ireland had originally been given to King Henry II of England by Pope Adrian IV in the 12th century as a feudal territory under papal overlordship . The meeting of Irish Parliament that proclaimed Henry VIII as King of Ireland was the first meeting attended by the Gaelic Irish chieftains as well as the Anglo @-@ Irish aristocrats . The style " Henry the Eighth , by the Grace of God , King of England , France and Ireland , Defender of the Faith and of the Church of England and also of Ireland in Earth Supreme Head " remained in use until the end of Henry 's reign .

 = Felix Mendelssohn = 
 Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy ( German : [ ˈjaːkɔp <unk> <unk> <unk> ̩ <unk> <unk> ] ; 3 February 1809 – 4 November 1847 ) , born and widely known as Felix Mendelssohn , was a German composer , pianist , organist and conductor of the early Romantic period . 
 A grandson of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn , Felix Mendelssohn was born into a prominent Jewish family . He was brought up without religion until the age of seven , when he was baptised as a Reformed Christian . Mendelssohn was recognised early as a musical prodigy , but his parents were cautious and did not seek to capitalise on his talent . 
 Mendelssohn enjoyed early success in Germany , where he also revived interest in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach , and in his travels throughout Europe . He was particularly well received in Britain as a composer , conductor and soloist , and his ten visits there – during which many of his major works were premiered – form an important part of his adult career . His essentially conservative musical tastes , however , set him apart from many of his more adventurous musical contemporaries such as Franz Liszt , Richard Wagner and Hector Berlioz . The Leipzig Conservatoire ( now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig ) , which he founded , became a bastion of this anti @-@ radical outlook . 
 Mendelssohn wrote symphonies , concerti , oratorios , piano music and chamber music . His best @-@ known works include his Overture and incidental music for A Midsummer Night 's Dream , the Italian Symphony , the Scottish Symphony , the overture The Hebrides , his mature Violin Concerto , and his String Octet . His Songs Without Words are his most famous solo piano compositions . After a long period of relative denigration due to changing musical tastes and antisemitism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , his creative originality has now been recognised and re @-@ evaluated . He is now among the most popular composers of the Romantic era . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Childhood = = = 
 Felix Mendelssohn was born on 3 February 1809 , in Hamburg , at the time an independent city @-@ state , in the same house where , a year later , the dedicatee and first performer of his Violin Concerto , Ferdinand David , was to be born . Mendelssohn 's father was the banker Abraham Mendelssohn , the son of the German Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn . His mother was Lea Salomon , a member of the <unk> family and a sister of Jakob Salomon Bartholdy . Mendelssohn was the second of four children ; his older sister Fanny also displayed exceptional and precocious musical talent . 
 The family moved to Berlin in 1811 , leaving Hamburg in disguise fearing French revenge for the Mendelssohn bank 's role in breaking Napoleon 's Continental System blockade . Abraham and Lea Mendelssohn sought to give their children – Fanny , Felix , Paul and Rebecka – the best education possible . Fanny became a well @-@ known pianist and amateur composer ; originally Abraham had thought that she , rather than Felix , would be the more musical . However , at that time , it was not considered proper , by either Abraham or Felix , for a woman to have a career in music , so Fanny remained an active but non @-@ professional musician . Abraham was also disinclined to allow Felix to follow a musical career until it became clear that he seriously intended to dedicate himself to it . 
 Mendelssohn grew up in an intellectual environment . Frequent visitors to the salon organised by his parents at the family 's home in Berlin included artists , musicians and scientists , amongst them Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt , and the mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet ( whom Mendelssohn 's sister Rebecka would later marry ) . Sarah Rothenburg wrote of the household that " Europe came to their living room " . 
 = = = Surname = = = 
 Abraham Mendelssohn renounced the Jewish religion ; he and his wife deliberately decided not to have Felix circumcised , in contravention of the Jewish tradition . Felix and his siblings were first brought up without religious education , and were baptised by a Reformed Church minister in 1816 , at which time Felix was given the additional names Jakob Ludwig . Abraham and his wife Lea were themselves baptised in 1822 , formally adopting the surname Mendelssohn Bartholdy ( which they had used since 1812 ) for themselves and their children . The name Bartholdy was added at the suggestion of Lea 's brother , Jakob Salomon Bartholdy , who had inherited a property of this name in <unk> and adopted it as his own surname . In an 1829 letter to Felix , Abraham explained that adopting the Bartholdy name was meant to demonstrate a decisive break with the traditions of his father Moses : " There can no more be a Christian Mendelssohn than there can be a Jewish Confucius " . On embarking on his musical career , Felix did not entirely drop the name Mendelssohn as Abraham requested , but in deference to his father signed his letters and had his visiting cards printed using the form ' Mendelssohn Bartholdy ' . In 1829 , his sister Fanny wrote to him of " Bartholdy [ ... ] this name that we all dislike " .

 Like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart before him , Mendelssohn was regarded as a child prodigy . He began taking piano lessons from his mother when he was six , and at seven was tutored by Marie Bigot in Paris . After the family moved to Berlin , all four Mendelssohn children studied piano with Ludwig Berger , who was himself a former student of Muzio Clementi . From at least May 1819 Felix ( and his sister Fanny ) studied counterpoint and composition with Carl Friedrich Zelter in Berlin . This was an important influence on his future career . Zelter had almost certainly been recommended as a teacher by his aunt Sarah Levy , who had been a pupil of W. F. Bach and a patron of C. P. E. Bach . Sarah Levy was a talented keyboard player in her own right , often playing with Zelter 's orchestra at the Sing @-@ Akademie zu Berlin , of which she and the Mendelssohn family were leading patrons . Sarah had formed an important collection of Bach family manuscripts which she bequeathed to the <unk> ; Zelter , whose tastes in music were conservative , was also an admirer of the Bach tradition . This undoubtedly played a significant part in forming Felix Mendelssohn 's musical tastes . His works show his study of Baroque and early classical music . His fugues and chorales especially reflect a tonal clarity and use of counterpoint reminiscent of Johann Sebastian Bach , by whose music he was deeply influenced . 
 = = = = Early maturity = = = = 
 Mendelssohn probably made his first public concert appearance at age 9 , when he participated in a chamber music concert accompanying a horn duo . He was also a prolific composer from an early age . As an adolescent , his works were often performed at home with a private orchestra for the associates of his wealthy parents amongst the intellectual elite of Berlin . Between the ages of 12 and 14 , Mendelssohn wrote 12 string symphonies for such concerts . These works were ignored for over a century , but are now recorded and occasionally played in concerts . He wrote his first published work , a piano quartet , by the time he was 13 . It was probably Abraham Mendelssohn who procured the publication of Mendelssohn 's early piano quartet by the house of Schlesinger . In 1824 , the 15 @-@ year @-@ old wrote his first symphony for full orchestra ( in C minor , Op. 11 ) . 
 At age 16 Mendelssohn wrote his String Octet in E @-@ flat major , the first work which showed the full power of his genius . This Octet and his Overture to Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream , which he wrote a year later in 1826 , are the best @-@ known of his early works . ( He later also wrote incidental music for the play , including the famous Wedding March , in 1842 ) . The Overture is perhaps the earliest example of a concert overture – that is , a piece not written deliberately to accompany a staged performance , but to evoke a literary theme in performance on a concert platform ; this was a genre which became a popular form in musical Romanticism . 
 In 1824 Mendelssohn studied under the composer and piano virtuoso Ignaz Moscheles , who however confessed in his diaries that he had little to teach him . Moscheles became a close colleague and lifelong friend . The year 1827 saw the premiere – and sole performance in his lifetime – of Mendelssohn 's opera , Die Hochzeit des Camacho . The failure of this production left him disinclined to venture into the genre again . 
 Besides music , Mendelssohn 's education included art , literature , languages , and philosophy . He had a particular interest in classical literature and translated Terence 's Andria for his tutor Heyse in 1825 ; Heyse was impressed and had it published in 1826 as a work of " his pupil , F * * * * " [ i.e. " Felix " ( asterisks as provided in original text ) ] . This translation also qualified Mendelssohn to study at the Humboldt University of Berlin , where from 1826 to 1829 he attended lectures on aesthetics by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel , on history by Eduard Gans and on geography by Carl Ritter . 
 = = = = Meeting Goethe and conducting Bach = = = = 
 In 1821 Zelter introduced Mendelssohn to his friend and correspondent , the elderly Johann Wolfgang von Goethe , who was greatly impressed by the child , leading to perhaps the earliest confirmed comparison with Mozart in the following conversation between Goethe and Zelter : 
 " Musical prodigies ... are probably no longer so rare ; but what this little man can do in <unk> and playing at sight borders the miraculous , and I could not have believed it possible at so early an age . " " And yet you heard Mozart in his seventh year at Frankfurt ? " said Zelter . " Yes " , answered Goethe , " ... but what your pupil already accomplishes , bears the same relation to the Mozart of that time that the cultivated talk of a grown @-@ up person bears to the prattle of a child . " 
 Mendelssohn was invited to meet Goethe on several later occasions , and set a number of Goethe 's poems to music . His other compositions inspired by Goethe include the overture Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage , ( Op. 27 , 1828 ) and the cantata Die erste Walpurgisnacht ( The First Walpurgis Night , Op. 60 , 1832 ) . 
 In 1829 , with the backing of Zelter and the assistance of actor Eduard Devrient , Mendelssohn arranged and conducted a performance in Berlin of Bach 's St Matthew Passion . Four years previously his grandmother , Bella Salomon , had given him a copy of the manuscript of this ( by then all @-@ but @-@ forgotten ) masterpiece . The orchestra and choir for the performance were provided by the Berlin <unk> . The success of this performance , one of the very few since Bach 's death and the first ever outside of Leipzig , was the central event in the revival of J. S. Bach 's music in Germany and , eventually , throughout Europe . It earned Mendelssohn widespread acclaim at the age of 20 . It also led to one of the few references which Mendelssohn made to his origins : " To think that it took an actor and a Jew 's son to revive the greatest Christian music for the world ! " 
 Over the next few years Mendelssohn traveled widely , including making his first visit to England in 1829 , and also visiting amongst other places Vienna , Florence , Milan , Rome and Naples , in all of which he met with local and visiting musicians and artists . These years proved the germination for some of his most famous works , including the Hebrides Overture and the Scottish and Italian symphonies .

 On Zelter 's death in 1832 , Mendelssohn had hopes of succeeding him as conductor of the Sing @-@ Akademie zu Berlin . However , at a vote in January 1833 he was defeated for the post by the less distinguished Carl Friedrich <unk> . This may have been because of Mendelssohn 's youth , and fear of possible innovations ; it was also suspected by some to be attributable to his Jewish ancestry . Following this rebuff , Mendelssohn divided most of his professional time over the next few years between Britain and Düsseldorf , where he was appointed musical director ( his first paid post as a musician ) in 1833 . 
 In the spring of that year Mendelssohn directed the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Düsseldorf , beginning with a performance of Handel 's oratorio Israel in Egypt prepared from the original score which he had found in London . This precipitated a Handel revival in Germany , similar to the reawakened interest in J. S. Bach following his performance of the St Matthew Passion . Mendelssohn worked with dramatist Karl Immermann to improve local theatre standards , and made his first appearance as an opera conductor in Immermann 's production of Mozart 's Don Giovanni at the end of 1833 , where he took umbrage at the audience 's protests about the cost of tickets . His frustration at his everyday duties in Düsseldorf , and the city 's provincialism , led him to resign his position at the end of 1834 . He had offers from both Munich and Leipzig for important musical posts , and decided in 1835 to accept the latter . 
 = = = = Leipzig and Berlin = = = = 
 In 1835 Mendelssohn was named conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra . He chose this position although he had also been offered direction of the opera house in Munich and the editorship of the prestigious music journal , the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung . Mendelssohn concentrated on developing the musical life of Leipzig , working with the orchestra , the opera house , the Choir of St. Thomas Church , and the city 's other choral and musical institutions . Mendelssohn 's concerts included , in addition to many of his own works , three series of " historical concerts " and a number of works by his contemporaries . He was deluged by offers of music from rising composers and would @-@ be composers ; amongst these was Richard Wagner , who submitted his early Symphony , which to Wagner 's disgust Mendelssohn lost or mislaid . Mendelssohn also revived interest in Franz Schubert . Robert Schumann discovered the manuscript of Schubert 's 9th Symphony and sent it to Mendelssohn , who promptly premiered it in Leipzig on 21 March 1839 , more than a decade after Schubert 's death . 
 A landmark event during Mendelssohn 's Leipzig years was the premiere of his oratorio St. Paul , given at the Lower Rhenish Festival in Düsseldorf in 1836 , shortly after the death of the composer 's father , which much affected him ; Felix wrote that he would " never cease to endeavour to gain his approval [ ... ] although I can no longer enjoy it " . St. Paul seemed to many of Mendelssohn 's contemporaries to be his finest work , and sealed his European reputation . 
 When Friedrich Wilhelm IV came to the Prussian throne in 1840 with ambitions to develop Berlin as a cultural centre ( including the establishment of a music school , and reform of music for the church ) , the obvious choice to head these reforms was Mendelssohn . He was however reluctant to undertake the task , especially in the light of his existing strong position in Leipzig . Mendelssohn did however spend some time in Berlin , writing some church music , and , at the King 's request , music for productions of Sophocles 's Antigone ( 1841 ) and Oedipus at Colonus ( 1845 ) , Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream ( 1843 ) and Racine 's <unk> ( 1845 ) . But the funds for the school never materialised , and various of the court 's promises to Mendelssohn regarding finances , title , and concert programming were broken . He was therefore not displeased to have the excuse to return to Leipzig . 
 In 1843 Mendelssohn founded a major music school – the Leipzig Conservatory , now the Hochschule für Musik und Theater " Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy " or ( in its own English self @-@ designation ) the Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy University of Music and Theatre – where he persuaded Ignaz Moscheles and Robert Schumann to join him . Other prominent musicians , including string players Ferdinand David and Joseph Joachim and music theorist Moritz Hauptmann , also became staff members . After Mendelssohn 's death in 1847 , his <unk> tradition was carried on when Moscheles succeeded him as head of the Conservatory . 
 = = = = Mendelssohn in Britain = = = = 
 In 1829 Mendelssohn paid his first visit to Britain , where his former teacher Ignaz Moscheles , already settled in London , introduced him to influential musical circles . In the summer he visited Edinburgh , where he met among others the composer John Thomson , whom he later recommended to be Professor of Music at Edinburgh University . On his eighth visit in the summer of 1844 , he conducted five of the Philharmonic concerts in London , and wrote : 
 [ N ] ever before was anything like this season – we never went to bed before half @-@ past one , every hour of every day was filled with engagements three weeks beforehand , and I got through more music in two months than in all the rest of the year . 
 On subsequent visits he met Queen Victoria and her musical husband Prince Albert , who both greatly admired his music . 
 In the course of ten visits to Britain during his life , totalling about 20 months , Mendelssohn won a strong following , sufficient for him to make a deep impression on British musical life . He composed and performed , and he edited for British publishers the first critical editions of oratorios of Handel and of the organ music of J. S. Bach . Scotland inspired two of his most famous works : the overture The Hebrides ( also known as Fingal 's Cave ) ; and the Scottish Symphony ( Symphony No. 3 ) . 
 Mendelssohn also worked closely with his protégé , the British composer and pianist William Sterndale Bennett ( whom he had first heard in London in 1833 when Bennett was 17 ) , both in London and Leipzig , where Bennett appeared throughout the 1836 / 1837 season . Mendelssohn 's oratorio Elijah was commissioned by and premiered at the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival on 26 August 1846 , composed to a German text translated into English by William Bartholomew , who authored and translated many of Mendelssohn 's works during his time in England . On his last visit to Britain in 1847 , Mendelssohn was the soloist in Beethoven 's Piano Concerto No. 4 and conducted his own Scottish Symphony with the Philharmonic Orchestra before the Queen and Prince Albert . 
 = = = = Death = = = = 
 Mendelssohn suffered from poor health in the final years of his life , probably aggravated by nervous problems and overwork . A final tour of England left him exhausted and ill from a hectic schedule . The death of his sister Fanny on 14 May 1847 caused him great distress . Less than six months later , on 4 November , Mendelssohn himself died in Leipzig after a series of strokes . He was 38 . His grandfather Moses , his sister Fanny and both his parents had died from similar <unk> . Felix 's funeral was held at the Paulinerkirche , Leipzig , and he was buried at the <unk> I in Berlin @-@ Kreuzberg . The pallbearers included Moscheles , Schumann and Niels Gade . Mendelssohn had once described death , in a letter to a stranger , as a place " where it is to be hoped there is still music , but no more sorrow or <unk> " . 
 = = = Personal life = = = 
 = = = = Personality = = = = 
 Although the image was cultivated , especially after his death in the detailed family memoirs by his nephew Sebastian Hensel , of a man always equable , happy and placid in temperament , this was misleading . The nickname " discontented Polish count " was given to Mendelssohn because of his aloofness , and he referred to the epithet in his letters . Mendelssohn was frequently given to alarming fits of temper which occasionally led to collapse . On one occasion in the 1830s , when his wishes had been crossed , " his excitement was increased so fearfully ... that when the family was assembled ... he began to talk incoherently , and in English , to the great terror of them all . The stern voice of his father at last checked the wild torrent of words ; they took him to bed , and a profound sleep of twelve hours restored him to his normal state " . Such fits may be related to his early death . 
 Mendelssohn was a fine and enthusiastic artist in pencil and watercolour , a skill which he used throughout his life for his own amusement and that of his friends . His enormous correspondence shows that he could also be a witty writer in German and English – sometimes accompanied by humorous sketches and cartoons in the text . 
 = = = = Religion = = = = 
 On 21 March 1816 , at the age of seven years , Mendelssohn was baptised with his brother and sisters in a home ceremony by Johann Jakob Stegemann , minister of the Evangelical congregation of Berlin 's Jerusalem Church and New Church . Although Mendelssohn was a conforming ( if not over @-@ zealous ) Christian as a member of the Reformed Church , he was both conscious and proud of his Jewish ancestry and notably of his connection with his grandfather Moses Mendelssohn . He was the prime mover in proposing to the publisher Heinrich Brockhaus a complete edition of Moses 's works , which continued with the support of his uncle Joseph Mendelssohn . Mendelssohn was notably reluctant , either in his letters or conversation , to comment on his innermost beliefs ; his friend Devrient wrote that " [ his ] deep convictions were never uttered in intercourse with the world ; only in rare and intimate moments did they ever appear , and then only in the slightest and most humorous allusions " . Thus for example in a letter to his sister Rebecka , Mendelssohn rebukes her complaint about an unpleasant relative : " What do you mean by saying you are not hostile to Jews ? I hope this was a joke [ ... ] It is really sweet of you that you do not despise your family , isn 't it ? " Some modern scholars have devoted considerable energy to demonstrate either that Mendelssohn was deeply sympathetic to his ancestors ' Jewish beliefs , or that he was hostile to this and sincere in his Christian beliefs . 
 = = = = Mendelssohn and his contemporaries = = = = 
 Throughout his life Mendelssohn was wary of the more radical musical developments undertaken by some of his contemporaries . He was generally on friendly , if sometimes somewhat cool , terms with the likes of Hector Berlioz , Franz Liszt , and Giacomo Meyerbeer , but in his letters expresses his frank disapproval of their works , for example writing of Liszt that his compositions were " inferior to his playing , and [ … ] only calculated for virtuosos " ; of Berlioz 's overture Les francs @-@ <unk> " the orchestration is such a frightful muddle [ ... ] that one ought to wash one 's hands after handling one of his scores " ; and of Meyerbeer 's opera Robert le diable " I consider it ignoble " , calling its villain Bertram " a poor devil " . When his friend the composer Ferdinand Hiller suggested in conversation to Mendelssohn that he looked rather like Meyerbeer – they were actually distant cousins , both descendants of Rabbi Moses Isserlis – Mendelssohn was so upset that he immediately went to get a haircut to differentiate himself . 
 In particular , Mendelssohn seems to have regarded Paris and its music with the greatest of suspicion and an almost puritanical distaste . Attempts made during his visit there to interest him in Saint @-@ <unk> ended in embarrassing scenes . 
 It is significant that the only musician with whom he remained a close personal friend , Ignaz Moscheles , was of an older generation and equally conservative in outlook . Moscheles preserved this outlook at the Leipzig Conservatory until his own death in 1870 . 
 = = = = Marriage and children = = = = 
 Mendelssohn married Cécile Charlotte Sophie <unk> ( 10 October 1817 – 25 September 1853 ) , the daughter of a French Reformed Church clergyman , on 28 March 1837 . The couple had five children : Carl , Marie , Paul , Lili and Felix . The second youngest child , Felix August , contracted measles in 1844 and was left with his health impaired ; he died in 1851 . The eldest , Carl Mendelssohn Bartholdy ( 7 February 1838 – 23 February 1897 ) , became a distinguished historian , and professor of history at Heidelberg and Freiburg universities , dying in 1897 in a psychiatric institution in Freiburg . Paul Mendelssohn Bartholdy ( 1841 – 1880 ) was a noted chemist and pioneered the manufacture of aniline dye . Marie married Victor Benecke and lived in London . Lili married Adolph Wach , later Professor of Law at Leipzig University . The family papers inherited by Marie and Lili 's children form the basis of the extensive collection of Mendelssohn manuscripts , including the so @-@ called ' Green Books ' of his correspondence , now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University . 
 Cécile Mendelssohn Bartholdy died less than six years after her husband , on 25 September 1853 . 
 = = = = Jenny Lind = = = = 
 In general Mendelssohn 's personal life seems to have been fairly conventional compared to those of his contemporaries Wagner , Berlioz , and Schumann – except for his relationship with Swedish soprano Jenny Lind , whom he met in October 1844 , and with whom , it was rumoured , he became emotionally involved . Papers confirming this were alleged to exist , although their contents had not been made public . In 2013 George <unk> confirmed in the Journal of the Royal Musical Association that " The Committee of the Mendelssohn Scholarship Foundation possesses material indicating that Mendelssohn wrote passionate love letters to Jenny Lind entreating her to join him in an adulterous relationship and threatening suicide as a means of exerting pressure upon her , and that these letters were destroyed on being discovered after her death . " 
 Mendelssohn met and worked with Lind many times , and started an opera , Lorelei , for her , based on the legend of the Lorelei Rhine maidens ; the opera was unfinished at his death . He is said to have tailored the aria " Hear Ye Israel " in his oratorio Elijah to Lind 's voice , although she did not sing this part until after his death , at a concert in December 1848 . In 1847 Mendelssohn attended a London performance of Meyerbeer 's Robert le diable – an opera which musically he despised – in order to hear Lind 's British debut , in the role of Alice . The music critic Henry Chorley , who was with him , wrote " I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn , whose enjoyment of Mdlle . Lind 's talent was unlimited , turned round and looked at me , as if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind . His attachment to Mlle. Lind 's genius as a singer was unbounded , as was his desire for her success " . 
 Upon Mendelssohn 's death Lind wrote , " [ He was ] the only person who brought fulfillment to my spirit , and almost as soon as I found him I lost him again " . In 1849 she established the Mendelssohn Scholarship Foundation , which makes an award to a British resident young composer every two years in Mendelssohn 's memory . The first winner of the scholarship was Arthur Sullivan , then aged 14 , in 1856 . In 1869 Lind erected a plaque in Mendelssohn 's memory at his birthplace in Hamburg .

 Richard Taruskin writes that , although Mendelssohn produced works of extraordinary mastery at a very early age , 
 he never outgrew his precocious youthful style . [ ... ] He remained stylistically conservative [ ... ] feeling no need to attract attention with a display of ' revolutionary ' novelty . Throughout his short career he remained comfortably faithful to the musical status quo – that is , the " classical " forms , as they were already thought of by his time . His version of romanticism , already evident in his earliest works , consisted in musical " <unk> " of a fairly conventional , objective nature ( though exquisitely wrought ) . 
 In this way he differed substantially from contemporaries such as Wagner and Berlioz , and even from Schumann and Chopin . The absence of real stylistic ' development ' during Mendelssohn 's career makes it appropriate to consider his works by genre , rather than in order of composition . 
 = = = = Early works = = = = 
 The young Mendelssohn was greatly influenced in his childhood by the music of Bach , Beethoven , and Mozart , traces of whom can be seen in the 12 early string symphonies , which were mainly written for performance in the Mendelssohn household and not published or publicly performed until long after his death . He wrote these from 1821 to 1823 , when he was between the ages of 12 and 14 . 
 Mendelssohn 's first published works were his three piano quartets , ( 1822 – 1825 ; Op. 1 in C minor , Op. 2 in F minor and Op. 3 in B minor ) ; but his capacities are especially revealed in a group of works of his early maturity : 
 the String Octet ( 1825 ) 
 the Overture A Midsummer Night 's Dream ( 1826 ) , which in its finished form also owes much to the influence of Adolf Bernhard Marx , at the time a close friend of Mendelssohn . 
 the two early quartets : Op. 12 ( 1829 ) and Op. 13 ( 1827 ) , which both show a remarkable grasp of the techniques and ideas of Beethoven 's last quartets that Mendelssohn had been closely studying 
 These four works show an intuitive grasp of form , harmony , counterpoint , colour , and compositional technique , which justify claims frequently made that Mendelssohn 's precocity exceeded even that of Mozart in its intellectual grasp . 
 = = = = Symphonies = = = = 
 Mendelssohn 's mature symphonies are numbered approximately in the order that they were published , rather than the order in which they were composed . The order of actual composition is : 1 , 5 , 4 , 2 , 3 . The placement of No. 3 in this sequence is problematic because he worked on it for over a decade , starting sketches for it soon after beginning work on No. 5 , but completing it after both Nos. 5 and 4 . 
 The Symphony No. 1 in C minor for full @-@ scale orchestra was written in 1824 , when Mendelssohn was aged 15 . This work is experimental , showing the influences of Beethoven and Carl Maria von Weber . Mendelssohn conducted this symphony on his first visit to London in 1829 , with the orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic Society . For the third movement he substituted an orchestration of the Scherzo from his Octet . In this form the piece was a success , and laid the foundations of his British reputation . 
 During 1829 and 1830 Mendelssohn wrote his Symphony No. 5 , known as the Reformation . It celebrated the 300th anniversary of the Lutheran Church . Mendelssohn remained dissatisfied with the work and did not allow publication of the score . 
 The Scottish Symphony ( Symphony No. 3 in A minor ) was written and revised intermittently between 1829 ( when Mendelssohn noted down the opening theme during a visit to Holyrood Palace ) and 1842 , when it was given its premiere in Leipzig , the last of his symphonies to be performed in public . This piece evokes Scotland 's atmosphere in the ethos of Romanticism , but does not employ any identified Scottish folk melodies . 
 Mendelssohn 's travels in Italy inspired him to write the Symphony No. 4 in A major , known as the Italian Symphony . He conducted the premiere in 1833 , but did not allow the score to be published during his lifetime , as he continually sought to rewrite it . 
 Mendelssohn wrote the symphony @-@ cantata Lobgesang ( Hymn of Praise ) in B @-@ flat major , posthumously named Symphony No. 2 , to mark the celebrations in Leipzig of the 400th anniversary of the invention of the printing press ; the first performance took place on 25 June 1840 . 
 = = = = Other orchestral music = = = = 
 Mendelssohn wrote the concert Hebrides Overture ( Fingal 's Cave ) in 1830 , inspired by visits to Scotland around the end of the 1820s . He visited Fingal 's Cave , on the Hebridean isle of Staffa , as part of his Grand Tour of Europe , and was so impressed that he scribbled the opening theme of the overture on the spot , including it in a letter he wrote home the same evening . 
 Throughout his career he wrote a number of other concert overtures . Those most frequently played today include an overture to Ruy Blas , commissioned for a charity performance of Victor Hugo 's drama , which Mendelssohn hated ; Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage ( <unk> und <unk> <unk> ) , inspired by a pair of poems by Goethe ; and The Fair Melusine . 
 The incidental music to A Midsummer Night 's Dream ( Op. 61 ) , including the well @-@ known Wedding March , was written in 1843 , seventeen years after the overture . 
 = = = = Opera = = = = 
 Mendelssohn wrote some <unk> for family performance in his youth . His opera Die beiden <unk> ( The Two Nephews ) was rehearsed for him on his 15th birthday . 1829 saw Die Heimkehr aus der <unk> ( Son and Stranger or Return of the <unk> ) , a comedy of mistaken identity written in honor of his parents ' silver anniversary and unpublished during his lifetime . In 1825 he wrote a more sophisticated work , Die Hochzeit des Camacho ( Camacho 's Wedding ) , based on an episode in Don Quixote , for public consumption . It was produced in Berlin in 1827 , but coolly received . Mendelssohn left the theatre before the conclusion of the first performance , and subsequent performances were cancelled . 
 Although he never abandoned the idea of composing a full opera , and considered many subjects – including that of the Nibelung saga later adapted by Wagner – he never wrote more than a few pages of sketches for any project . In Mendelssohn 's last years the opera manager Benjamin Lumley tried to contract him to write an opera from Shakespeare 's The Tempest on a libretto by Eugène Scribe , and even announced it as forthcoming in 1847 , the year of Mendelssohn 's death . The libretto was eventually set by Fromental Halévy . At his death Mendelssohn left some sketches for an opera on the story of the Lorelei . 
 = = = = Concertos = = = = 
 The Violin Concerto in E minor , Op. 64 ( 1844 ) , written for Ferdinand David , has become one of the most popular of all of Mendelssohn 's compositions . David , who had worked closely with Mendelssohn during the piece 's preparation , gave the premiere of the concerto on his <unk> violin . 
 Mendelssohn also wrote a lesser @-@ known , early concerto for violin and strings in D minor ( 1822 ) ; four piano concertos ( " no . 0 " in A minor , 1822 ; 1 in G minor , Op. 25 , 1831 ; 2 in D minor , Op. 40 , 1837 ; and 3 in E minor , Op. <unk> . , a fragment from 1844 ) ; two concertos for two pianos and orchestra , E major ( MWV <unk> ) , which he wrote at 15 , and A @-@ flat major ( MWV O6 ) , at 17 ; and another double concerto , for violin and piano ( 1823 ) . In addition , there are several single @-@ movement works for soloist and orchestra . Those for piano are the Rondo Brillante , Op. 29 , of 1834 ; the Capriccio Brillante , Op. 22 , of 1832 ; and the Serenade and Allegro <unk> Op. 43 , of 1838 . He also wrote two <unk> ( <unk> ) , Opp . 113 and 114 , originally for clarinet , basset horn and piano ; Op. 113 was orchestrated by the composer . 
 = = = = Chamber music = = = = 
 Mendelssohn 's mature output contains numerous chamber works , many of which display an emotional intensity lacking in some of his larger works . In particular , his String Quartet No. 6 , the last of his string quartets and his last major work – written following the death of his sister Fanny – is both powerful and eloquent . Other mature works include two other string quintets ; sonatas for the clarinet , cello , viola and violin ; and two piano trios . For the Piano Trio No. 1 in D minor , Mendelssohn uncharacteristically took the advice of his fellow composer , Ferdinand Hiller , and rewrote the piano part in a more romantic , " <unk> " style , considerably heightening its effect . 
 = = = = Choral works = = = = 
 Mendelssohn 's two large biblical oratorios , St Paul in 1836 and Elijah in 1846 , are greatly influenced by Bach . His unfinished oratorio , Christus , consists of a recitative , a chorus " There Shall a Star Come out of Jacob , " and a male trio ; the chorus is sometimes performed . 
 <unk> different is the more overtly romantic Die erste Walpurgisnacht ( The First Walpurgis Night ) , a setting for chorus and orchestra of a ballad by Goethe describing pagan rituals of the Druids in the Harz mountains in the early days of Christianity . This remarkable score has been seen by the scholar Heinz @-@ Klaus Metzger as a " Jewish protest against the domination of Christianity " . 
 Mendelssohn also wrote many smaller @-@ scale sacred works for unaccompanied choir and for choir with organ . Most are written in or translated into English , and remain highly popular . Amongst the most famous is Hear My Prayer , whose second half contains " O for the Wings of a Dove , " which became extremely popular as a separate item . The piece is written for full choir , organ , and a treble or soprano soloist who has many challenging and extended solo passages . As such , it is a particular favourite for choirboys in churches and cathedrals and has frequently been recorded as a treble solo . Mendelssohn 's biographer Todd comments " The very popularity of the anthem in England [ ... ] later exposed it to charges of superficiality from those contemptuous of Victorian mores " . 
 The hymn tune Mendelssohn – an adaptation by William Hayman Cummings of a melody from Mendelssohn 's cantata <unk> ( Festive Hymn ) – is the standard tune for Charles Wesley 's popular hymn Hark ! The Herald Angels Sing . This extract from an originally secular 1840s composition , which Mendelssohn felt unsuited to sacred music , is ubiquitous at Christmas . 
 = = = = Songs = = = = 
 Mendelssohn wrote many songs , both for solo voice and for duet , with piano . Many of these are simple , or slightly modified , strophic settings . Some , including Auf <unk> des <unk> ( On Wings of Song ) , became popular . Nine of Mendelssohn 's songs , including Auf <unk> des <unk> and Neue Liebe ( New Love , set to a poem by Heinrich Heine ) were transcribed for piano solo , in a virtuoso style , by Franz Liszt . 
 A number of songs written by Mendelssohn 's sister Fanny originally appeared under her brother 's name ; this may have been partly due to the prejudice of the family , and partly to her own retiring nature . 
 = = = = Piano music = = = = 
 Mendelssohn 's Songs Without Words ( Lieder ohne Worte ) , eight cycles each containing six lyric pieces ( two published posthumously ) , remain his most famous solo piano compositions . They became standard parlour recital items even during the composer 's lifetime , and their overwhelming popularity has itself caused many critics to underrate their musical value . Other composers who were inspired to produce similar pieces of their own , included Charles @-@ Valentin Alkan ( his five sets of Chants , each ending with a <unk> ) , Anton Rubinstein , Ignaz Moscheles , and Edvard Grieg . 
 Other notable piano pieces by Mendelssohn include his Variations <unk> , Op. 54 ( 1841 ) , the Rondo Capriccioso , the set of six Preludes and Fugues , Op. 35 ( written between 1832 and 1837 ) , and the Seven Characteristic Pieces , Op. 7 ( 1827 ) . 
 = = = = Organ music = = = = 
 Mendelssohn played the organ and composed for it from the age of 11 to his death . His primary organ works are the Three Preludes and Fugues , Op. 37 ( 1837 ) , and the Six Sonatas , Op. 65 ( 1845 ) , of which Eric Werner wrote " next to Bach 's works , Mendelssohn 's Organ Sonatas belong to the required repertory of all organists " . 
 = = = Performer = = = 
 Mendelssohn was renowned during his lifetime as a keyboard performer , both on the piano and on the organ . One of his obituarists noted : 
 First and chiefest we esteem his pianoforte @-@ playing , with its amazing elasticity of touch , rapidity , and power ; next his scientific and vigorous organ playing [ ... ] his triumphs on these instruments are fresh in public recollection . 
 In his concerts and recitals Mendelssohn performed both his own works and those of his predecessor German composers , notably works of Weber , Beethoven and ( on the organ ) J.S. Bach . 
 Both in private and public performances , Mendelssohn was also renowned for his improvisations . On one occasion in London , when asked by the soprano Maria Malibran after a recital to <unk> , he created a piece which included the melodies of all the songs she had sung . The music publisher Victor Novello who was present remarked ' He has done some things that seem to me impossible , even after I have heard them done . ' At another recital in 1837 , where Mendelssohn played the piano for a singer , Robert Schumann ignored the soprano and wrote ' Mendelssohn accompanied like a God ' . 
 = = = Conductor = = = 
 Mendelssohn was a noted conductor , both of his own works and of other composers . At his London debut in 1829 , he was noted for his innovatory use of a baton ( then a great novelty ) . But his novelty also extended to taking great care over tempo , dynamics and the orchestral players themselves – both rebuking them when they were recalcitrant and praising them when they satisfied him . It was his success at conducting at the Lower Rhine music festival of 1836 that led to him taking his first paid professional position as director at Düsseldorf . Amongst those who appreciated Mendelssohn 's conducting was Hector Berlioz , who in 1843 , invited to Leipzig , exchanged batons with Mendelssohn , writing " When the Great Spirit sends us to hunt in the land of souls , may our warriors hang our tomahawks side by side at the door of the council chamber " . At Leipzig , Mendelssohn led the Gewandhaus orchestra to great heights ; although concentrating on the great composers of the past ( already becoming canonised as the ' classics ' ) he also included new music by Schumann , Berlioz , Gade and many others ( including of course his own music ) . One critic who was not impressed however was Richard Wagner ; he accused Mendelssohn of using tempos in his performances of Beethoven symphonies that were far too fast . 
 = = = Editor = = = 
 Mendelssohn 's interest in baroque music was not limited to the Bach St Matthew Passion which he had revived in 1829 . He was concerned in preparing and editing such music , whether for performance or for publication , to be as close as possible to the original intentions of the composers , including wherever possible a close study of early editions and manuscripts . This could lead him into conflict with publishers ; for instance , his edition of Handel 's oratorio Israel in Egypt for the London Handel Society ( 1845 ) evoked an often contentious correspondence , with Mendelssohn refusing for example to add dynamics where not given by Handel , or to add parts for trombones . Mendelssohn also edited a number of Bach 's works for organ , and apparently discussed with Robert Schumann the possibility of producing a complete Bach edition . 
 = = = Teacher = = = 
 Although Mendelssohn attributed great importance to musical education , and made a substantial commitment to the Conservatoire he founded in Leipzig , he did not greatly enjoy teaching and undertook only a very few private pupils ; these he took only if he believed they had notable qualities or potential . Amongst such students were composer William Sterndale Bennett , the pianist Camille @-@ Marie Stamaty , the violinist and composer Julius <unk> , and Walther von Goethe ( grandson of the poet ) . At the Leipzig Conservatoire Mendelssohn taught classes in composition and ensemble playing .

 = = = The first century = = = 
 In the immediate wake of Mendelssohn 's death , he was mourned both in Germany and England . However , the conservative strain in Mendelssohn , which set him apart from some of his more flamboyant contemporaries , bred a corollary condescension amongst some of them toward his music . Mendelssohn 's relations with Berlioz , Liszt and others had been uneasy and equivocal . Listeners who had raised questions about Mendelssohn 's talent included Heinrich Heine , who wrote in 1836 after hearing the oratorio St. Paul that his work was " characterized by a great , strict , very serious seriousness , a determined , almost importunate tendency to follow classical models , the finest , cleverest calculation , sharp intelligence and , finally , complete lack of naïveté . But is there in art any originality of genius without naïveté ? " 
 Such criticism of Mendelssohn for his very ability – which could be characterised negatively as facility – was taken to further lengths by Richard Wagner . Mendelssohn 's success , his popularity and his Jewish origins irked Wagner sufficiently to damn Mendelssohn with faint praise , three years after his death , in an anti @-@ Jewish pamphlet Das Judenthum in der Musik : 
 [ Mendelssohn ] has shown us that a Jew may have the <unk> store of specific talents , may own the finest and most varied culture , the highest and tenderest sense of honour – yet without all these pre @-@ eminences helping him , were it but one single time , to call forth in us that deep , that heart @-@ searching effect which we await from art [ ... ] The <unk> and the whimsicality of our present musical style has been [ ... ] pushed to its utmost pitch by Mendelssohn 's endeavour to speak out a vague , an almost <unk> Content as interestingly and <unk> as possible . 
 This was the start of a movement to downgrade Mendelssohn 's status as a composer which lasted almost a century , the echoes of which still survive today in critiques of Mendelssohn 's supposed mediocrity . 
 The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche expressed consistent admiration for Mendelssohn 's music , in contrast to his general scorn for " Teutonic " Romanticism : 
 At any rate , the whole music of romanticism [ e.g. Schumann and Wagner ] ... was second @-@ rate music from the very start , and real musicians took little notice of it . Things were different with Felix Mendelssohn , that halcyon master who , thanks to his easier , purer , happier soul , was quickly honored and just as quickly forgotten , as a lovely incident in German music . 
 Some readers , however , have interpreted Nietzsche 's characterization of Mendelssohn as a ' lovely incident ' as condescending . 
 In the 20th century the Nazi regime and its <unk> cited Mendelssohn 's Jewish origin in banning performance and publication of his works , even asking Nazi @-@ approved composers to rewrite incidental music for A Midsummer Night 's Dream ( Carl Orff obliged ) . Under the Nazis , " Mendelssohn was presented as a dangerous ' accident ' of music history , who played a decisive role in rendering German music in the 19th century ' degenerate ' . " The German Mendelssohn Scholarship for students at the Leipzig Conservatoire was discontinued in 1934 ( and not revived until 1963 ) . The monument dedicated to Mendelssohn erected in Leipzig in 1892 was removed by the Nazis in 1936 . A replacement was erected in 2008 . His grave however remained unmolested during the National Socialist years . 
 Mendelssohn 's reputation in England remained high throughout the 19th century . Prince Albert inscribed ( in German ) , a libretto for the oratorio Elijah in 1847 : 
 To the noble artist who , surrounded by the Baal @-@ worship of false art , has been able , like a second Elijah , through genius and study , to remain true to the service of true art . 
 In 1851 an adulatory novel by the teenaged Elizabeth Sara Sheppard was published , entitled Charles <unk> . The book features as its leading character Mendelssohn , as the " Chevalier <unk> " , and remained in print for nearly 80 years . In 1854 Queen Victoria requested that the Crystal Palace include a statue of Mendelssohn when it was rebuilt . Mendelssohn 's Wedding March from A Midsummer Night 's Dream was played at the wedding of Queen Victoria 's daughter , Princess Victoria , The Princess Royal , to Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia in 1858 , and it remains popular at marriage ceremonies . Mendelssohn 's sacred choral music , particularly the smaller @-@ scale works , remains popular in the choral tradition of the Church of England . However many critics , including Bernard Shaw , began to condemn Mendelssohn 's music for its association with Victorian cultural insularity ; Shaw in particular complained of the composer 's " kid @-@ glove gentility , his conventional sentimentality , and his despicable oratorio @-@ mongering " . In the 1950s the scholar Wilfrid Mellers complained of Mendelssohn 's " spurious religiosity which reflected the element of unconscious humbug in our morality " . 
 A contrasting opinion came from the pianist and composer Ferruccio Busoni , who considered Mendelssohn " a master of undisputed greatness " and " an heir of Mozart " . Busoni and other pianists such as Anton Rubinstein and Charles @-@ Valentin Alkan all regularly included Mendelssohn 's piano works in their recitals . 
 = = = Modern opinions = = = 
 Charles Rosen in a chapter on Mendelssohn in his 1995 book The Romantic Generation both praises and criticizes the composer , calling him a " genius " with a " profound " comprehension of Beethoven and " the greatest child prodigy the history of Western music has ever known " . Although Rosen feels that in his later years , without losing his craft or genius , the composer " renounced ... his daring " , he calls Mendelssohn 's relatively late Violin Concerto in E minor " the most successful synthesis of the Classical concerto tradition and the Romantic virtuoso form " . Rosen calls the Fugue in E minor ( later included in Mendelssohn 's Op. 35 for piano ) a " masterpiece " ; but in the same paragraph calls Mendelssohn " the inventor of religious kitsch in music " . 
 Such opinions are evidence of how a more nuanced appreciation of Mendelssohn 's work has developed over the last 50 years , together with the publication of a number of modern biographies placing his achievements in context . Mercer @-@ Taylor comments on the irony that " this broad @-@ based reevaluation of Mendelssohn 's music is made possible , in part , by a general disintegration of the idea of a musical canon " , an idea which Mendelssohn " as a conductor , pianist and scholar " had done so much to establish .
