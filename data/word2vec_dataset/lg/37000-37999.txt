 John Baldwin was born in Branford , Connecticut on 13 October 1799 to Joseph Baldwin and Rosanna Malley . His mother was a well @-@ educated woman , as well as intensely religious . She attempted to become a student at Yale University , but was not allowed because she was a woman . Due to this , John resolved to make no distinction between races or sexes should he ever found a school . His father enlisted in the Continental Army during the American Revolution as a private and left as a captain . When John turned eighteen , he joined the Methodist Church . As a student at a private school , he paid his way by chopping firewood , ringing the bell , and building fires . Afterwards , he became a teacher in Fishkill , New York , Maryland , and Litchfield , Connecticut . As a teacher in Maryland , his stance on slavery , as well as black people as a whole , was revealed . A mulatto boy was sent to his school daily as a servant for his master 's son . Baldwin began to teach them in common . When the student 's father found out about this , he demanded Baldwin not teach him any more , to which he replied , " I do not charge anything for teaching him " and continued to teach him .

 After marrying Mary Chappel on January 31 , 1828 , they moved to Middleburg Township in Cuyahoga County , Ohio in April of that year . It was there that Baldwin joined forces with James <unk> , a disciple of Josiah Holbrook who wanted to found a lyceum village . In the village , which was founded in 1837 and situated just north of his farm , Baldwin ran the Lyceum Village School for five years until June 1842 , when it went bankrupt . However , one day while walking home , he had an impulse to take a new route across the river on his farm . He noticed a grouping of exposed rocks , which would make superior grindstones . This was the beginning of the Berea grindstone industry . Baldwin shipped his grindstones to Cleveland by ox carts . After the Big Four Railroad was built from Cleveland to Cincinnati , Baldwin built a railroad which would connect his quarries to the Big Four Depot . It was then that Baldwin and the others of the Lyceum Village tried to think of a name for their new town . After <unk> proposed Tabor , John Baldwin suggested Berea , citing Acts 17 : 10 – 11 . After a coin flip , Berea was chosen .

 In 1843 , Baldwin noticed that the Norwalk Seminary , located in Norwalk , Ohio , was dissolving due to lack of funds . He approached Thomas Thompson , who was the elder of the Norwalk District ( which included Cleveland and Berea ) , and asked him to visit Berea . At Baldwin 's Old Red House , an agreement was made where Baldwin would create a campus on his farm similar to the Norwalk Seminary . Baldwin Institute officially opened on April 9 , 1846 . It was meant to open in 1845 , but the process was delayed until the completion of a building on Baldwin 's farm , which was erected by Baldwin himself , made of stone quarried on his farm and brick made of clay . The institute was open to people of all races , male or female , as Baldwin wanted . It became Baldwin University and was given a charter in 1855 . The university later became Baldwin – Wallace College in 1913 . 
 = = = Life in Kansas = = = 
 At age fifty @-@ eight , Baldwin desired to satisfy his nature of being a pioneer again by moving to Kansas , which was at that time a territory . He arrived as the brunt of the fighting in the territory was ending . Upon his arrival , he founded Baldwin City and built the first college building in the territory , which became the foundation for Baker University . He was in Kansas only for a short time when tragedy struck . On August 30 , 1858 , John 's son Milton died unexpectedly after having been sick for only three days . Within a couple years , he laid out a town , built a grist mill and a saw mill , and he turned over the town and college to the Methodist Conference and returned to Berea , although he continued to finance it .

 In 1867 , Baldwin purchased the Darby plantation in Louisiana , a plantation of about 1 @,@ 700 acres ( 6 @.@ 9 km2 ) . At the age of eighty , Baldwin learned of the situation in India ; there were large numbers of Europeans in India who could not get a proper education . The Baldwin High School for Boys and the Baldwin High School for Girls were then built in 1880 . John Baldwin died at his home in Baldwin , Louisiana on Sunday , December 28 , 1884 , at 10 A.M. Baldwin 's family even left their legacy on the campus long after Baldwin 's death . A person of historical significance to the university 's history is Philura Gould Baldwin . Philura Gould Baldwin graduated in 1886 and was the granddaughter of John Baldwin . Philura started the school 's first library by collecting and cataloging books . Beyond this , Philura suggested the traditional colors of brown and gold for the school colors . These were also the school colors for Baldwin University , which still stand today . Philura died from consumption at age 26 ( b . November 28 , 1865 ; d . March 3 , 1892 ) . The Baldwin family donated funds for a library that was dedicated in her memory in June 1894 . The Philura Gould Baldwin Library was eventually made part of the <unk> Center in the 1900s .

 John Baldwin was a person whose views seemed to run counter to the conventional customs of the time . Despite his accomplishments , he never wrote a book , held public office , or even kept books . Although he was not an abolitionist by definition , he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals , as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender . His parents taught him to fear God , and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously , to being kind to the poor , and to joining the Methodist Church . 
 = Steve Nash = 
 Stephen John Nash , OC , <unk> ( born February 7 , 1974 ) , is a Canadian retired professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . He was an eight @-@ time NBA All @-@ Star and a seven @-@ time All @-@ NBA selection . Twice , Nash was named the NBA Most Valuable Player while playing for the Phoenix Suns . He currently serves as general manager of the Canadian national team and as a player development consultant for the Golden State Warriors . 
 After a successful high school basketball career in British Columbia , Nash earned a scholarship to Santa Clara University in California . In his four seasons with the Broncos , the team made three NCAA Tournament appearances , and he was twice named the West Coast Conference ( WCC ) Player of the Year . Nash graduated from Santa Clara as the team 's all @-@ time leader in assists and was taken as the 15th pick in the 1996 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns . He made minimal impact and was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in 1998 . By his third season with the Mavericks , he was voted to his first NBA All @-@ Star Game and had earned his first All @-@ NBA selection . Together with Dirk Nowitzki and Michael Finley , Nash led the Mavericks to the Western Conference Finals the following season . He became a free agent after the 2003 – 04 season and returned to the Phoenix Suns . 
 In the 2004 – 05 season , Nash led the Suns to the Western Conference Finals and was named the league 's MVP . He was named MVP again in the 2005 – 06 season and was runner @-@ up for a third consecutive MVP to Nowitzki in 2006 – 07 . Named by ESPN in 2006 as the ninth greatest point guard of all time , Nash led the league in assists and free @-@ throw percentage at various points in his career . He is also ranked as one of the top players in NBA league history in three @-@ point shooting , free @-@ throw shooting , total assists , and assists per game . 
 Nash has been honoured for his contributions to various philanthropic causes . In 2006 , he was named by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world . He was appointed to the Order of Canada in 2007 and invested to the order in 2016 , and was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws by the University of Victoria in 2008 . 
 Nash has been a co @-@ owner of the Vancouver Whitecaps FC of Major League Soccer ( MLS ) since the team entered the league in 2011 . In 2012 , he was named general manager of the Canadian men 's national basketball team , for whom he played from 1991 to 2003 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Nash was born in Johannesburg , South Africa , to a Welsh mother , Jean , and English father , John , on 7 February 1974 . His family moved to Regina , Saskatchewan when he was 18 months old , before settling in Victoria , British Columbia . He therefore holds British as well as Canadian citizenship . Before the family settled in Canada , his father played professional soccer in various parts of the world . Nash often played soccer and ice hockey with his younger brother Martin , and did not start playing basketball until he was 12 or 13 years old . In grade eight , however , he told his mother that one day he would play in the NBA and would become a star . He was neighbour to future NHL stars Russ and Geoff Courtnall , who used to babysit him and played soccer coached by Nash 's father . 
 = = High school career = = 
 Nash originally attended Mount Douglas Secondary School in Saanich , British Columbia , but after his grades began to drop , his parents decided to enroll him at St. Michaels University School , a private boarding school in Victoria . There , he starred in basketball , soccer , and rugby union . While playing basketball during his senior season , Nash averaged 21 @.@ 3 points , 11 @.@ 2 assists , and 9 @.@ 1 rebounds per game . In the 1991 – 92 season , he led his team in his final year to the British Columbia AAA provincial championship title , and was named the province 's Player of the Year . 
 = = College career = = 
 Although Nash 's high school coach , Ian Hyde @-@ Lay , sent letters of inquiry and highlight reels on Nash 's behalf to over 30 American universities , Nash was not recruited by any university , until Santa Clara coach Dick Davey requested video footage of the young guard . After watching Nash in person , Davey said he " was nervous as hell just hoping that no one else would see him . It didn 't take a Nobel Prize winner to figure out this guy 's pretty good . It was just a case of hoping that none of the big names came around . " However , Davey also told Nash that he was " the worst defensive player " he had ever seen . 
 Nash was awarded a scholarship by Santa Clara for the 1992 – 93 season . At that time , it had been five years since the Broncos appeared in the NCAA tournament . That changed when Nash led the Broncos to a WCC Tournament title and an upset win over the No. 2 seeded Arizona in the first round of the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . In that game , Nash scored six straight free throws in the last 30 seconds of the contest . Although Santa Clara was defeated by Temple in the next round , the 1992 – 93 campaign was considered a successful one . However , the Broncos failed to sustain the momentum the following season , and only managed a 5 – 7 record in the conference . The team rebounded in the 1994 – 95 season , with Nash being named Conference Player of the Year and the Broncos topping the WCC . Featuring the league leader for scoring and assists in Nash , the Broncos returned to the NCAA tournament , but they were defeated by Mississippi State . After the season , Nash contemplated turning professional , and decided against it when he learned that he would probably not be considered as a first @-@ round pick in the 1995 NBA Draft . 
 In the 1995 – 96 season , Nash began attracting the attention of the national media and professional scouts . He had spent the summer before that honing his skills , playing with the Canadian national team and working out with the likes of established NBA players Jason Kidd and Gary Payton . Santa Clara again captured the WCC title , and for the second consecutive year , Nash was named Conference Player of the Year , the first Bronco to do so since Kurt Rambis . He scored 28 points in leading the No. 10 seed Broncos to a first round upset win over No. 7 seed Maryland , but then the Broncos were eliminated by Kansas . Nash 's performances ensured that he earned an honourable mention All @-@ America as a senior by The Associated Press and the USBWA . He also finished his career as Santa Clara 's all @-@ time leader in career assists ( 510 ) , free @-@ throw percentage ( <unk> ) , and made and attempted three @-@ pointers ( 263 – 656 ) . He remains third on the school 's all @-@ time scoring list ( 1 @,@ 689 ) , and holds Santa Clara 's single @-@ season free @-@ throw percentage record ( <unk> ) . In September 2006 , Nash had his jersey ( # 11 ) retired , becoming the first Santa Clara student @-@ athlete to receive that honour .

 After graduating with a degree in sociology , Nash was selected 15th overall by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 1996 NBA draft . Upon hearing the draft announcement , Suns fans booed in disapproval of the relatively unknown player . This was because despite his impressive college accomplishments , Nash had not played in one of the major college conferences . A major influence in Phoenix 's choice was assistant coach Donnie Nelson , who met Nash back in high school as he was coached by Nelson 's friend Ken Shields , and would eventually befriend the player as he played in Santa Clara . During his first two seasons in the NBA , Nash played a supporting role behind NBA star point guards Kevin Johnson , Sam Cassell , and later , Jason Kidd . Both Johnson and Cassell had NBA Finals experience , while Kidd was the second overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and already an All @-@ Star when he arrived at Phoenix . 
 In his rookie season , Nash only managed 10 @.@ 5 minutes a game , but in his second season , his playing time increased significantly and he was even ranked 13th in the league for three @-@ point field @-@ goal percentage . Nevertheless , the Canadian 's tenure with the Suns did not last . Nelson had just taken a job as assistant general manager of the Dallas Mavericks under his father , Don Nelson , and convinced him to acquire the under @-@ utilised Nash . Following the 1998 NBA Draft , Nash was traded from the Suns to the Mavericks in exchange for Martin <unk> , Bubba Wells , the draft rights to Pat Garrity and a first @-@ round draft pick ( who later turned out to be future Phoenix team @-@ mate Shawn Marion ) . 
 = = = Dallas Mavericks ( 1998 – 2004 ) = = = 
 It was in Dallas that Nash established himself as a formidable point guard , beginning a decade as one of the game 's top players . During his first year as a Maverick ( the lockout @-@ shortened 1998 – 99 season ) he started in all 40 games he played in , and averaged 7 @.@ 9 points , 2 @.@ 9 rebounds and 5 @.@ 5 assists per game . The 19 – 31 Mavericks failed to make the playoffs but in the 1999 – 2000 season , the team 's prospects improved considerably . Nash missed 25 mid @-@ season games due to an ankle injury , but came back to record six double @-@ doubles in the last month of play . He finished the season with averages of 8 @.@ 6 points and 4 @.@ 9 assists per game . More importantly for the team , second @-@ year teammate and friend Dirk Nowitzki was blossoming quickly into a top player , veteran Michael Finley was having an All @-@ Star @-@ calibre year , and the team 's new owner , billionaire Mark Cuban , was bringing new energy and excitement to the franchise . Nash now had a supportive environment in which he could thrive . 
 In the 2000 – 01 season , Nash averaged 15 @.@ 6 points and 7 @.@ 3 assists per game in a breakout season . With Nash directing the team 's offense , Nowitzki and Finley playing at their best , and the acquisition of All @-@ Star Juwan Howard complementing the high @-@ scoring trio , the Mavericks earned a playoff berth for the first time in more than a decade . Dallas lost in the Western Conference Semifinals four games to one to the San Antonio Spurs , but it marked the beginning of a memorable run for Nash and the Mavericks . In the 2001 – 02 season , Nash posted career @-@ highs of 17 @.@ 9 points and 7 @.@ 7 assists per game and earned a spot in the NBA All @-@ Star Game and on the All @-@ NBA Third Team . He was now an All @-@ Star , increasingly appearing in television commercials and , with Finley and Nowitzki , a part of the Dallas Mavericks " Big Three . " Dallas earned another trip to the playoffs but lost again in the Semifinals to the Sacramento Kings four games to one . 
 Nash closely replicated his previous season 's performance in the 2002 – 03 season , averaging 17 @.@ 7 points and 7 @.@ 3 assists per game , again earning All @-@ Star and All @-@ NBA Third Team honours . Nowitzki and Nash led the Mavericks from a 14 @-@ game winning streak to open the season all the way to the Western Conference Finals , where they lost to the eventual NBA champions , the San Antonio Spurs four games to two . It was only the second Conference Finals appearance in the franchise 's history . The 2003 – 04 season saw an offensively boosted Mavericks roster ( with the acquisitions of Antoine Walker and Antawn Jamison ) but a dip in Nash 's scoring contributions . As a result , he was not selected for the All @-@ Star and All @-@ NBA team rosters even though he achieved new career highs in assists per game ( 8 @.@ 8 ) and free @-@ throw accuracy ( 91 @.@ 6 % ) . In the playoffs , the fifth @-@ seeded Dallas failed to make progress yet again as the Sacramento Kings saw them off four games to one . 
 After the 2003 – 04 season , Nash became a free agent . He attempted to negotiate a long @-@ term contract with Cuban , who was paying Walker , Finley , Nowitzki and Jamison nearly $ 50 million in combined salaries that season . Cuban wanted to build his franchise around the younger Nowitzki and did not want to risk signing the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Nash to a long @-@ term deal , and offered Nash a four @-@ year deal worth about $ 9 million annually , with a fifth year partially guaranteed . The Phoenix Suns on the other hand offered the point guard a six @-@ year , $ 63 million contract . Nash was reluctant to leave Dallas and returned to Cuban to see if he would match the deal ; Cuban did not , and Nash signed with the Suns for the 2004 – 05 season . The Canadian would go on to win two League MVP awards with Phoenix , and on a 14 June 2006 appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman , Cuban wondered out loud , " ... you know Steve 's a great guy and I love him to death , but why couldn 't he play like an MVP for us ? " 
 = = = Return to Phoenix ( 2004 – 2012 ) = = = 
 Nash joined a Suns team which had emerging young players in Shawn Marion , Joe Johnson and Amar 'e Stoudemire . In the season before Nash arrived , the Suns had recorded a 29 – 53 win – loss record , and they were projected to have another poor season . Head coach Mike D 'Antoni favoured an up @-@ tempo style of basketball ; this required smaller and more athletic players with the capability to outrun and outshoot their opponents . Nash 's familiarity with this style combined with the athleticism of his teammates produced an NBA @-@ best 62 – 20 record and a points @-@ per @-@ game average of 110 @.@ 4 , the highest in a decade . The catalyst of this turnaround , Nash averaged 11 @.@ 5 assists per game while making 50 @.@ 2 % of his field goals and 43 @.@ 1 % of his three @-@ pointers in the regular season . He edged Shaquille O 'Neal to win the 2004 – 05 NBA MVP award , becoming the first Canadian to earn the honour , as well as the third point guard ever to be named MVP , along with Magic Johnson and Bob Cousy . In the playoffs , Phoenix swept the Memphis Grizzlies in four games before meeting the Dallas Mavericks in the second round . Nash led the Suns to a 4 – 2 series win , and the Suns reached the Western Conference finals for the first time since 1993 , but lost to the eventual NBA Champions and arch @-@ rival , the San Antonio Spurs , in five games . 
 The next season , Stoudemire suffered a serious knee injury , and Johnson and Quentin Richardson were traded away . The Suns were not expected to repeat their successful 2005 season , but with Nash directing the same high @-@ tempo offence , the team compiled a respectable 54 – 28 record and won the division title . The Suns were again the highest @-@ scoring team in the league with seven players averaging double figures in points per game , and Nash was voted for the first time to start for the 2006 Western All @-@ Star team . Having recorded career highs in points ( 18 @.@ 8 ) , rebounds ( 4 @.@ 2 ) , field goal percentage ( .512 ) and free @-@ throw percentage ( a league @-@ leading .921 ) , and leading the league with 10 @.@ 5 assists per game , Nash was named the league MVP for the second year in a row . In the first round of the playoffs , Phoenix overcame a 3 – 1 deficit against the Los Angeles Lakers and won the series 4 – 3 . The Los Angeles Clippers were their Conference Semifinals opponents , and the Suns again needed seven games to clinch the series . For the second year in a row however , the Suns bowed out in the Conference Finals , this time to Nash 's former team , Dallas . 
 In the 2006 – 07 season , Nash had another stellar campaign , averaging 18 @.@ 6 points and a career @-@ high 11 @.@ 6 assists per game while becoming the first person since Magic Johnson in 1990 – 91 to average 18 points and 11 assists per game during the regular season . Nash received the most votes for first @-@ team All @-@ NBA and was joined by teammate Stoudemire ; the two were the first teammates to make the first team since Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O 'Neal in 2003 – 04 . Nash received 129 first @-@ place votes and 645 total points from the panel of 129 media members . He narrowly missed being MVP a third consecutive time , coming in second with 44 first place votes to 83 for Dirk Nowitzki . In the playoffs , the Suns eliminated the Lakers in five games before losing 4 – 2 to the Spurs in the Conference Semifinals . 
 Nash played in 81 regular @-@ season games during the 2007 – 08 season ; in this campaign , the Western Conference was especially competitive and he led the Suns to 55 wins and the sixth seed for the 2008 NBA Playoffs . Although there was a dip in his regular @-@ season output , Nash 's shooting remained sharp ; the accuracy of his shooting was on par with his 2005 – 06 MVP campaign ( shooting at least 50 % from the field , 40 % from the three @-@ point arc , and 90 % from the free throw line ) . On 31 January 2008 , he collected his All @-@ Star stripes for the sixth time in his career . However , Nash continued to experience agony in the playoffs . Despite a mid @-@ season trade that sent Shawn Marion to the Miami Heat and brought four @-@ time NBA champion Shaquille O 'Neal to the team , the Suns were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs for the third time in four years . In the deciding Game 5 , Nash was perceived to have suffered from " elimination @-@ game jitters " , and turned over the ball twice in the final two minutes of what was a tight contest . Nevertheless , Nash was later named to the All @-@ NBA Second Team for the 2007 – 08 season . 
 Before the 2008 – 09 season began , coach D 'Antoni was replaced by Terry Porter , who preferred a more defensive @-@ oriented style of basketball . The Suns had difficulties adapting to this new system , and even a December trade involving sending stalwarts Raja Bell and Boris Diaw to the Charlotte Bobcats for athletic swingman Jason Richardson saw the team continue to struggle . Porter was then replaced by Alvin Gentry in February after a 28 – 23 record , but the Suns were unable to secure the final seed for the playoffs , resulting in Nash missing the playoffs for the first time since he returned to Phoenix for his second stint . 
 Nash and the Suns opened the 2009 – 10 season with a series of strong performances , going 8 – 1 in their first nine games ( a franchise @-@ best since 1980 – 81 ) , with Nash producing two 20 @-@ assists games . On 21 January 2010 , Nash was named as the starting point guard for the West for the 2010 NBA All @-@ Star Game . With him operating at the point , the Suns were the highest @-@ scoring team in the league for the fifth season in a row , and were seeded third in the conference for the playoffs with 54 wins . Behind solid performances by Richardson and veteran Grant Hill , the Suns defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 4 – 2 in the first round of the playoffs , and swept the Spurs 4 – 0 in the second round . The Suns met the defending champions , Los Angeles Lakers , in the Conference Finals . After losing the first two games , Phoenix won the next two to tie the series . A Ron Artest buzzer @-@ beater in Game 5 pushed the Lakers one game closer to the Finals , and Kobe Bryant 's 37 points in Game 6 completed the defeat of the Suns . 
 The Suns underwent two major roster changes in the 2010 – 11 season . During the pre @-@ season , Stoudemire left for New York , while longtime teammate Leandro Barbosa was traded for Hedo Türkoğlu . Josh Childress and Hakim Warrick were also recruited to join the Suns . Not long after the season began , Türkoğlu , Richardson , and Earl Clark were traded to Orlando for Vince Carter , Marcin <unk> , and Mickaël <unk> , while rising star Goran <unk> was traded to the Houston Rockets for Aaron Brooks . The Suns had difficulty being even a .500 team , and for the second time since Nash returned to Phoenix , the Suns failed to make the playoffs . 
 In February 2012 , Nash was named to his eighth All @-@ Star Game . At the time , he was leading the NBA in assists per game . On 21 April 2012 , Nash passed Oscar Robertson for career assists versus the Denver Nuggets . Despite his stellar play the Suns missed the playoffs for the second consecutive time . He finished the season averaging 12 @.@ 5 points and 10 @.@ 7 assists per game on 53 @.@ 2 % shooting from the field ( tying his career high ) . 
 = = = Los Angeles Lakers ( 2012 – 2015 ) = = = 
 On July 11 , 2012 , the Los Angeles Lakers acquired Nash in a sign @-@ and @-@ trade deal with Phoenix . Nash also considered signing with New York or Toronto , but he decided that Los Angeles was the best fit for him and his family . Nash switched his jersey number , as his customary No. 13 was retired by Los Angeles in honour of Wilt Chamberlain . Nash , an avid soccer fan , chose No. 10 to pay homage to Glenn Hoddle , Zinedine Zidane and other soccer playmakers who wore the number . Entering his 17th NBA season , Nash came to the Lakers with concerns over his defense and the health of his back . 
 In the second game of the 2012 – 13 season , Nash suffered a non @-@ displaced fracture in his left leg after a collision with Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers . He was expected to miss at least one week , but was out of the lineup for close to seven weeks . He was reunited with D 'Antoni , who took over as Lakers coach after Mike Brown was fired after a 1 – 4 start . On 22 December , Nash returned against the Golden State Warriors , helping the Lakers win their first overtime game of the season , 118 – 115 , scoring 12 points with 9 assists in 41 minutes of play . The Lakers won three of the first four games after Nash returned . However , they lost their next four , including a 125 – 112 loss to Houston on 8 January 2013 , when Nash assisted on an Antawn Jamison jumper to become the fifth player in NBA history to reach 10 @,@ 000 career assists . 
 Kobe Bryant was moved to defend the opponent 's primary ball handler , freeing Nash from unfavourable matchups . Nash also struggled with Dwight Howard to run the pick and roll , a play that D 'Antoni had expected would be a staple for the Lakers . D 'Antoni moved Nash off the ball and made him more of a spot @-@ up shooter , while Bryant became the primary facilitator on offense . Nash missed the last eight games of the season with a right hip injury that also caused nerve damage in his right hamstring . The team qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed , but were swept 4 – 0 by San Antonio in the first round . Nash missed the last two games of the series after recurring issues with his hip and hamstring . In what he called arguably " the most frustrating " season of his career , Nash missed a career @-@ high 32 games in the regular season , and averaged his fewest assists ( 6 @.@ 7 ) since 1999 – 2000 , when he was a part @-@ time starter with Dallas . 
 During 2013 – 14 season , Nash continued to suffer nerve problems stemming from his leg injury the prior season . In November , he was sidelined for an estimated minimum of two weeks due to nerve root irritation . Nash returned on February 4 , 2014 , shooting 3 @-@ for @-@ 6 for 7 points . On February 7 , 2014 , his 40th birthday , he scored a season @-@ high 19 points in a victory over the Philadelphia 76ers . On March 13 , Nash was ruled out for the remainder of the season by D 'Antoni . He was suffering from a recurrence of nerve problems stemming from an earlier collision to his left leg with Chicago 's Kirk Hinrich , and the Lakers wanted to give Kendall Marshall and Jordan Farmar more playing time . However , Nash returned on March 21 after a groin injury to Farmar that was expected to sideline him a minimum of two weeks . 
 In July 2014 , Nash announced that the 2014 – 15 season would be his last . During the preseason , he experienced back pain , and further aggravated his back while lifting luggage . On 23 October , less than a week before the start of what would have been the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Nash 's 19th year in the NBA , he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury . Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back . Nash on injuring his back : " Being on the court this season has been my top priority , and it is disappointing to not be able to do that right now . I work very hard to stay healthy , and unfortunately my recent setback makes performing at full capacity difficult . I will continue to support my team during this period of rest and will focus on my long @-@ term health . " 
 = = Retirement and consulting duties = = 
 Nash announced his retirement from playing on March 21 , 2015 . Before the announcement , the Cleveland Cavaliers had said to Nash 's agent that they were interested in him as a backup for Kyrie Irving if Nash asked for a buyout . Nash refused it , due to both his health concerns and wanting to retire as a Laker in gratitude for the opportunity given by the club . Nash was later on approached by another former team of his , the Dallas Mavericks , to have one last season with them instead , but he declined due to his aforementioned health concerns . 
 On September 25 , 2015 , it was confirmed that Nash would take on part @-@ time consulting duties for the Golden State Warriors . 
 = = International career = = 
 In the early 1990s , Nash was cut from the Canadian junior national team by head coach Ken <unk> , father of future NBA player Kelly <unk> . At age 17 , he was the youngest member of Team Canada at the 1991 World University Games , where the team won a silver medal . 
 In 1993 , while in college , he played for the senior national team at the Tournament of the Americas and competed in the Canada Games ( for the British Columbia team ) and World University Games . He won a bronze medal at the Canada Games and won a silver medal at the World University Games , losing to Team USA in a closely contested final , which included players such as Michael Finley and Damon Stoudamire . 
 At the 1999 Tournament of the Americas , Nash led Canada to the silver medal , qualifying the team for the Olympics for the first time in 12 years ; he was named tournament MVP . Nash captained Canada at the 2000 Sydney Olympics . He led Canada to win their round robin group with a victory over Spain and a stunning 83 – 75 win over favoured Yugoslavia when he scored 26 points with eight rebounds and eight assists . Canada was eliminated in the quarterfinals with a five @-@ point loss to France and Nash left the court in tears . Nash expressed disappointment with the result , saying " It hurts a lot . I feel like I let everybody down . We could have been in the championship game . We were good enough . " Nevertheless , he did see a possible silver lining , saying " Hopefully kids [ in Canada ] will be inspired to play — that 's what I really hope . " A victory in its final game of the tournament , a placement game against Russia , enabled Canada to salvage seventh place . Nash 's Olympic performance propelled him to stardom in Canada and he finished fifth in voting for the 2000 Lionel Conacher Award , which is handed out to the Canadian male athlete of the year . 
 Nash again led Team Canada during qualifying for the 2004 Summer Olympics at the FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in San Juan , Puerto Rico . He led the tournament in assists and was named tournament MVP , but Canada finished fourth , missing out on the three Olympic spots available . That was the last time Nash played for Canada ; he was reportedly upset about the firing of head coach Jay Triano in 2004 . In December 2007 , he said , " In my mind right now , I 'm not going to play for Canada any more . " 
 On May 8 , 2012 , Nash became General Manager of the Canadian senior national team . Three months later , he rehired Triano as head coach .

 Nash is most noted for his playmaking , ball @-@ handling skills and shooting . He led the league in assists for five years , averaging 11 @.@ 5 assists per game in 2004 – 05 , 10 @.@ 5 in 2005 – 06 , 11 @.@ 6 in 2006 – 07 , 11 @.@ 0 in 2009 – 10 and 11 @.@ 4 in 2010 – 11 and won the 2005 and 2010 NBA All @-@ Star Skills Contests . As of the end of 2012 – 13 season , he had a 90 @.@ 4 % career free @-@ throw shooting average ( best in NBA history ) and a 42 @.@ 8 % career three @-@ point shooting average ( eighth @-@ best in league history ) , and ranked as one of the top 10 players in league history in total assists , assists per game , and three @-@ point field goals made . In addition , he is ranked second ( starting from 1986 – 87 ) in regular season point @-@ assist double doubles . In the 2005 – 06 season , Nash became the fourth player in NBA history to shoot 50 % or better from the field , 40 % from three @-@ point range ( 43 @.@ 9 ) , and 90 % from the line , joining Larry Bird , Reggie Miller , and Mark Price in the 50 – 40 – 90 Club . Nash would repeat this feat three more times in the 2007 – 08 , 2008 – 09 and 2009 – 10 campaigns . Nash ( four times ) and Larry Bird ( two times ) are the only players to have accomplished this feat more than once . A two @-@ time NBA MVP , Nash is only the second point guard ( along with Magic Johnson ) to win the MVP award multiple times and the third guard in NBA history to earn back @-@ to @-@ back MVPs ( joining Johnson and Michael Jordan ) . Only ten other NBA players have won back @-@ to @-@ back MVP awards : Johnson , Jordan , Bill Russell , Wilt Chamberlain , Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar , Moses Malone , Larry Bird , Tim Duncan , LeBron James , and Stephen Curry . On 11 May 2006 , ESPN.com rated Nash as the 9th @-@ best point guard of all time , and in a survey by nba.com in 2007 , Nash received 85 % of the votes by the league 's general managers as best point guard in the league . In a similar survey in 2009 , Nash was rated as the best passer of the ball and the player possessing the best basketball IQ . Commenting on Nash losing out to former teammate Dirk Nowitzki for the 2007 NBA MVP , Boston Celtics centre and Hall of Famer Russell stated : " I think , on the world stage , he 's one of our great athletes in all sports ... I 'm a big fan . The two MVPs he got , he deserved . Part of the reason that he 's so good and so effective is that the guys like playing with him . He creates an atmosphere where they win games . " 
 In terms of specific skills , Nash was particularly effective playing the pick and roll , notably with Nowitzki when he was with the Mavericks and later with the Suns ' Amar 'e Stoudemire and Shawn Marion . When Nash returned to Phoenix in 2004 , he helped the Suns improve from a 29 – 53 record in 2003 – 04 to 62 – 20 in 2004 – 05 , reaching the Conference Finals for the first time in 11 years , earning him his first MVP award . The next season , he led the Suns into the Conference Finals , despite the injuries of all three big men ( Stoudemire , Kurt Thomas and Brian Grant ) ; further , Nash was responsible for seven of his teammates attaining career @-@ highs in season scoring . With Nash operating at the point , between the 2005 – 06 and 2009 – 10 seasons , the Suns led the league in field goal percentage .

 = U.S. Route 80 in California = 
 U.S. Route 80 ( US 80 ) was a U.S. highway in California that continued east across the country to Georgia . The western terminus was in San Diego , California , and US 80 continued east through the city on several different alignments through the years . The highway went through the Cuyamaca Mountains , encountering many switchbacks , before descending to El Centro . After passing through the sand dunes , the highway crossed the Colorado River into Yuma , Arizona . 
 The highway replaced a 1912 plank road across much of Imperial County . The winding two @-@ lane road through the Cuyamaca Mountains was one of the factors that led to a four @-@ hour journey from San Diego to El Centro . During the 1930s , the road was realigned through the mountains , but several curves remained . In the 1950s , work began on constructing what would become Interstate 8 ( I @-@ 8 ) to replace the old highway in San Diego to bypass the cities of San Diego , La Mesa , and El Cajon . This started with the construction of the Alvarado Canyon road as well as Mission Valley Road through the San Diego area , as well as construction a replacement for the old highway across the Viejas Grade . The construction continued across the rest of the route through the next two decades . US 80 was gradually decommissioned after 1964 as I @-@ 8 , through San Diego and Imperial counties , was completed . In 2006 , the highway was designated by the California State Legislature as Historic U.S. Route 80 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 There were multiple alignments through the downtown San Diego area . The route as of 1928 began at Broadway ( US 101 ) and ran along 4th Avenue north to University Avenue in the Hillcrest district , then went east on University Avenue . By 1933 , the routing had shifted to use Park Boulevard south of University Avenue into downtown , to end at Market Street ; the city council voted that July to use University Avenue west of Park Boulevard to connect to US 101 , to obtain federal funding for improving that road . The next year , the Point Loma highway was referred to as the western terminus of US 80 by E.E. Wallace , a district highway engineer . Nevertheless , the state @-@ produced highway maps from the next few years did not reflect the change , or this choice of the western terminus . 
 In the early days of World War II , some maps showed the western terminus of US 80 at the Cabrillo National Monument on Point Loma , running north on Catalina Boulevard , north then east on Cañon Street , northeast on Rosecrans Street , southeast on Lytton Street , east on Barnett Avenue , south on Pacific Highway ( US 101 ) and finally east on Market Street , before continuing north along Park Boulevard to El Cajon Boulevard . US 395 ran concurrently along the route from downtown San Diego to the intersection with Fairmount Avenue . By 1942 , the US 395 concurrency had been removed . With the completion of the Cabrillo Freeway , between 1946 and 1948 , US 80 shifted from Park Boulevard to 11th Avenue north onto the new freeway before continuing east onto El Cajon Boulevard towards La Mesa . The final San Diego alignment , with signs to be placed in 1954 , moved the western terminus to the intersection with US 101 where it traveled east on what was known as Camino del Rio and Alvarado Canyon Road , and then continuing on the Mission Valley road towards La Mesa . According to Caltrans district engineer Jacob Dekema , during the 1950s , the parts of Camino Del Rio and Rosecrans Street from Lytton Street and Rosecrans Street to Pacific Highway were considered a part of US 80 . 
 East of San Diego , US 80 followed the path of El Cajon Boulevard through La Mesa and then onto Main Street near downtown El Cajon before heading towards the Mountain Springs grade . The route was realigned from Arnold Way onto Alpine Boulevard as it passed through Alpine and the Viejas Indian Reservation , before entering the Laguna Mountains and the Cleveland National Forest on the alignment used by I @-@ 8 . At Laguna Junction , a cafe for travelers existed from 1916 until when the building was taken down to provide land for the interchange with I @-@ 8 . A section of old US 80 — with the first few miles signed as SR 79 — continues to serve as access to the communities of Descanso , <unk> and Pine Valley ; SR 79 intersected US 80 east of Descanso . At the time , the Ellis Wayside Rest provided a rest area for travelers ; later , the state recognized it as a historic site . Exiting the national forest , US 80 continued in a southeasterly direction towards Live Oak Springs and Boulevard , intersecting with the eastern terminus of SR 94 . US 80 then came close to the Mexican border as it curved around the Jacumba Mountains and into the hot spring town of Jacumba . East of there , US 80 passed by the Desert View Tower . 
 US 80 then descended rapidly into Imperial County along the In @-@ Ko @-@ Pah Gorge just west of Coyote Wells and Ocotillo before entering the city limits of El Centro . East of El Centro , US 80 again continued into Holtville . US 80 cut a southeasterly trajectory , running parallel and very close to the Mexican border , and traversing the Algodones Dunes and the Colorado Desert . It finally reached Winterhaven before crossing the Colorado River into Yuma , Arizona . Almost the entire length of the former US 80 within Imperial County has since been designated County Route S80 .

 Route 12 was added to the state highway system in 1909 from San Diego to El Centro , and Route 27 was added from El Centro to Yuma in 1915 . Before a highway was constructed through the Imperial San Dunes , travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach Yuma . The first route through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together . The road was completed by October 1912 , and portions were still visible into the 2010s . The Ocean @-@ to @-@ Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915 , and a new plank road was opened that year which became state @-@ maintained in 1917 , and used a foundation of wooden rails , with the planks bound together by steel , as opposed to simple planks that were fastened to rails . However , traffic congestion and dusty conditions made travel along the plank road difficult . The delay in constructing a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California . 
 A stagecoach road existed into the 19th century that passed through the mountains east of San Diego . Construction was discussed as early as 1911 , with The San Diego Union and Daily Bee saying that it " will be one of the best in the system . " Well before the freeway was constructed , the automobile road through the mountains east of San Diego was narrow and wound through the mountains ; it was officially dedicated in 1912 . This trip was known to take up to four hours , and frequently resulted in the radiator boiling over , flat tires , or broken fan belts ; recent inclement weather would result in cars becoming mired in the mud . But meanwhile , Colonel Ed Fletcher declared the road a " success " , and indicated his belief that a concrete road from San Diego to Yuma would soon follow , responding to criticism that a road from Los Angeles to Brawley should have been built . 
 US 80 was designated on November 11 , 1926 , along with the rest of the U.S. Routes . The asphalt road was constructed through the valley as the main east – west route , and was open by 1927 . Another road was constructed in the early 1930s , to remove curves and widen the lanes . The result was a two @-@ lane road that still had many switchbacks , with one popularly known as " Dead Man 's Curve " . Planning for this new alignment was underway in 1932 , and much of the work was to be located at the Viejas Grade , and at the segment just west of Alpine . Paving continued on US 80 into 1934 , just west of the sand dunes . 
 Meanwhile , Imperial County businessmen hoped to promote the use of this road over the route from Phoenix to Los Angeles , to increase tourism . Eventually , US 80 did become the most used road into Southern California from the east , but by 1947 , the Highway 80 Associated was formed to increase the traffic on the road , since the war and advertising by other cities had caused it to fall again . Four years later , US 80 was reported to be the most used transcontinental highway , and there was a 40 percent increase in the out @-@ of @-@ state cars that traveled through the state inspection station at Yuma during the first three months of that year . But in 1954 , there were reports that traffic had decreased , because the road to Phoenix , Arizona from Lordsburg , New Mexico had improved . 
 = = = Early freeway development = = = 
 Starting in 1932 , county and state officials proposed rerouting US 80 away from what is now La Mesa Boulevard . Although the city raised concerns about the proposal , due to the shift in transportation design towards " free @-@ access highways " where vehicles could travel up to 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) , and the success of the Arroyo Seco Parkway in Los Angeles , the La Mesa Scout newspaper withdrew their objections to the construction . In the meantime , parts of El Cajon Boulevard through downtown El Cajon were widened in 1935 . Federal funds were allocated for rerouting US 80 in 1940 ; by then , La Mesa Boulevard had been designated as a U.S. 80 Business Route , and El Cajon Boulevard then carried the US 80 designation to San Diego . But in 1947 , the San Diego Highway Development Association criticized the proliferation of traffic signals and businesses on El Cajon Boulevard , during the discussion of how to resolve traffic issues on US 101 through Oceanside . 
 World War II stalled most freeway projects in the San Diego area . Plans were developed by 1946 for a freeway through Alvarado Canyon that would connect with the Cabrillo Freeway . Funding was obtained by 1949 for the 5 @.@ 4 miles ( 8 @.@ 7 km ) portion between 70th Street and Lake Murray Boulevard , and <unk> Avenue . The first portion of the Alvarado Canyon Highway , the first freeway thorough La Mesa , was opened in early 1950 . Reports indicated that this decreased the time to travel from La Mesa to San Diego by a factor of two , with 7 @,@ 000 trips on the route each day . That same year , the San Diego city manager expressed concerns at the Highway Commission meeting about shifting US 80 away from El Cajon Boulevard to the Alvarado Canyon and Mission Valley Road route , due to the potential loss of commerce for businesses located near the current route . 
 In 1948 , the Highway 80 Chamber of Commerce president complained that funds were being prioritized for US 395 construction , instead of on US 80 . In September , the county supervisors approved the Mission Valley road as a limited access highway , but held off on processing the results from surveying . The next month , $ 1 million was allocated to the realignment of the Viejas grade , namely , increasing the radius of the curves from 300 feet ( 91 m ) to 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) , as well as limiting the grade to 4 percent . By 1949 , the project was under way , with prisoners contributing to the labor force , and was projected to include a tunnel as well as several crossings of the Sweetwater River . A longer 34 miles ( 55 km ) tunnel through the Cuyamaca Mountains was also proposed that year , which would have been the longest in the world . But by 1950 , work on the Viejas grade had stalled , due to the prison labor camp being shut down ; efforts were then made to start work again . More funds were allocated by the State Highway Commission a few months later , and the work was to be put out for bid to complete the project . 
 Meanwhile , construction continued on the western part of the US 80 freeway . On August 27 , 1951 , the final link in the new freeway between Point Loma and La Mesa was dedicated . The next year , planning continued for the possibility of a freeway bypass of El Cajon that would connect to the existing US 80 freeway . However , many El Cajon Boulevard motel owners raised objections over the reassigning of the US 80 designation to the new freeway , as it would potentially harm business . In response , the Highway Development Association proposed designating El Cajon Boulevard as a business route . But in order to obtain funding for the construction , the new route would have to be added to the state highway system by the California State Legislature , or be designated as US 80 . Later , a Freeway 80 Association was formed to encourage public support for the construction of the bypass of El Cajon , and the conversion of the Alvarado Canyon and Mission Valley roads into a freeway . Following the city of San Diego council and county approval , the California State Assembly transportation committee heard complaints from citizens claiming that they had not been adequately notified about the plans for US 80 or SR 94 , or given enough time to provide input . 
 In Imperial County , discussion regarding rerouting US 80 south of the city of Holtville began in August 1953 . The next year , the state director of public works announced that the route would be rebuilt to the south for 7 miles ( 11 km ) as a freeway . In February 1954 , the California Highway Commission declared that both the Alvarado Canyon and Mission Valley roads , as well as the new Holtville alignment , were to be part of US 80 ; an alignment was also chosen for the part of the highway that passed through El Cajon . A $ 934 @,@ 211 contract was given out to construct the Holtville portion in April . Contrary to the recommendation of the California Senate Interim Committee on Highways to study constructing the freeway to replace US 80 on a new alignment , San Diego County officials decided to pursue upgrading the existing road to become a freeway . Another route through the Lyons Valley was considered as an alternative . The Highway Development Association proposed adding grade @-@ separated interchanges on the routing of US 80 through San Diego , as well as reconstructing the interchange with the Cabrillo Freeway , as well as finishing the work on the Viejas Grade and through the mountains . That year , according to Caltrans , the interchange with US 395 was the busiest in the county . 
 = = = Interstate Highway System = = = 
 In April 1955 , a Caltrans official announced that US 80 would be built as a freeway for its entire length in California , as it was to be included in the Interstate Highway System . In the meantime , while plans moved further along on US 101 , the mayor of San Diego asked the California Highway Commission to keep the US 80 project on track . However , the construction was put on hold because of lower traffic levels on US 80 , compared to other local highways . State Assemblyman <unk> raised the issue in the Assembly Highway subcommittee in December , stating that the construction of the freeway would help the economy and the Port of San Diego . State Senator Collier went even further and blamed the delay on San Diego County officials , in addition to linking the delay to damaging the program to develop the port . The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956 , at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 2 million , and was in use until 1978 , when the I @-@ 8 bridge was built . 
 Finally , in May 1957 , bids opened for the part of US 80 between Grossmont Boulevard in La Mesa and Chase Avenue in El Cajon , that would connect to the new SR 67 freeway . Groundbreaking took place on June 10 , and the project was to cost $ 3 @.@ 6 million . The rebuilding of the Cabrillo Freeway interchange became a priority due to the availability of federal funding , and due to the traffic problems encountered with having ramps entering from both the left and the right . In July , the Highway Development Association decided to formally raise the issue of the incomplete highway survey through Imperial County at the next California Highway Commission meeting . In 1958 , federal funds were allocated to construct US 80 from Taylor Street to Fairmount Avenue as an eight @-@ lane freeway , and from there to 70th Street as a divided highway . In August , the state announced that there were four proposed routes for US 80 through the mountains , including one with a tunnel . A contract was later awarded to construct the freeway from Taylor Street to the Cabrillo Freeway at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 2 million . In November , Caltrans announced that the Walker Canyon route had been chosen for US 80 , which would allow for the route to be constructed in stages , as well as being the least expensive alternative . 
 By the end of the year , plans were being made for construction of the freeway between Flume Drive east of El Cajon and Laguna Junction , and the portion of the freeway from Fairmount Avenue to Lake Murray Boulevard was contracted for $ 2 @.@ 6 million . In January 1960 , the Taylor Street to Cabrillo Freeway portions were under construction , including the interchange at the latter , and were scheduled to be complete by October , while the Cabrillo Freeway to <unk> Avenue portion was up for bid ; the next month , the contract was awarded for $ 4 @.@ 6 million , with interchanges to be constructed at Texas Street and Ward Road to replace traffic signals . In July , the new I @-@ 8 designation for the road was announced , and plans to post signs were made . Another contract for the portion from Grossmont Summit near Chase Avenue to Ballantyne Avenue was awarded for $ 2 @.@ 7 million in November . 
 But in 1960 , Jacob Dekema , the district highway engineer , stated that due to lower traffic on US 80 , the completion of the freeway through the mountains would be delayed until at least 1971 . Construction of the section of US 80 from Magnolia Avenue to Third Street was contracted for $ 2 @.@ 7 million in April . That year , work continued on the freeway , and in August , only one traffic signal was left on the highway west of El Cajon , at Ward Road . In August , Dekema announced that bids for the portion between Lake Murray Boulevard and Third Street would be opened the following month ; once that was completed , the entire freeway west of El Cajon would be complete . Eastbound lanes between US 395 and Fairmount Avenue opened on November 23 . 
 The portion from the Grossmont summit to Magnolia Avenue and SR 67 was completed in April 1961 . By August , the entirety of the freeway west of El Cajon was complete , with the exception of the portions from near Lake Murray Boulevard to near La Mesa Boulevard for $ 3 @.@ 1 million , as well as between Magnolia Avenue and the El Cajon eastern city limits for $ 2 @.@ 7 million . In addition to this , the part of the freeway from near Grays Well to Ogilby Road in Imperial County was also being constructed for $ 2 @.@ 3 million . The 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) freeway portion east of Magnolia Avenue that connected with the undivided US 80 opened on September 6 . The final section in La Mesa was completed in April 1962 . Construction started on the Mountain Springs portion of US 80 in September 1962 . That year , US 80 west of the Cabrillo Freeway interchange was declared to be the busiest road in the City of San Diego , at 71 @,@ 000 daily vehicles . 
 US 80 was removed from the state highway system in the 1964 state highway renumbering when I @-@ 80 was designated ; I @-@ 8 assumed the routing from San Diego to El Centro and Yuma . However , US 80 signs were posted for several years afterward on the remaining portions of the original asphalt road that had not been bypassed by the freeway . The AASHO formally recognized California 's requested elimination of US 80 by 1969 . Gradually , the route was removed from Arizona , New Mexico and part of Texas between 1977 and 1991 . After the freeway was built , the population of Jacumba went from 400 to 200 , and many businesses closed or relocated . However , the population began to increase after a few years , and residents began commuting to jobs in El Centro and San Diego . Following a campaign from the local Old Highway 80 Committee and endorsement from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors , the California State Legislature passed a resolution allowing for the route to be designated and signed as a state historic route , Historic U.S. Route 80 , in 2006 .

 Harmy 's Despecialized Edition is a series of fan edits of the first three films in the George Lucas @-@ created Star Wars franchise : Star Wars , The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi . The edits were created by a team of Star Wars fans led by Petr " Harmy " Harmáček , an English teacher from Plzeň , Czech Republic . The original Star Wars trilogy was released theatrically by 20th Century Fox for Lucasfilm between 1977 and 1983 . Subsequent releases on home media , such as the 1997 " Special Edition " releases , introduced significant changes to the films , including additional scenes and new computer @-@ generated imagery – these changes were met with a mixed response from critics . As of 2014 , the films are no longer widely available in their original theatrical releases . 
 Harmáček felt that altering the films in this way constituted " an act of cultural vandalism " , and in 2010 was inspired to create his own series of fan edits that restored the theatrical releases in high @-@ definition . With no experience in professional film editing , he taught himself as he went , using programs such as <unk> and Adobe After Effects . Taking the 1993 LaserDisc releases as a guide and a majority of source material from the 2011 Blu @-@ ray releases , Harmáček and a team of eight other fans constructed the edits over many thousands of hours of work . In 2011 , one year after the project had begun , the first version of Harmy 's Despecialized Edition was published online . Updated versions have been created in the years that followed . 
 As a fan edit , Harmy 's Despecialized Edition cannot be legally bought or sold , and is " to be shared among legal owners of the officially available releases only " .

 The original Star Wars trilogy was a Lucasfilm production released theatrically by 20th Century Fox between 1977 and 1983 , and was subsequently released on home media during the 1980s and 1990s . The films were distributed by CBS / Fox Video on several formats , such as VHS , Betamax and LaserDisc . In 1997 , to coincide with the 20th anniversary of Star Wars , Lucas rereleased new cuts of the trilogy to theaters , naming them the " Special Editions " . The Special Editions made a number of changes to the original releases , including additions such as enhanced digital effects , previously unreleased scenes , and entirely new CGI sequences . 
 Reaction to the new cuts was mixed , with commentators criticising unnecessary additions such as a computer @-@ generated Jabba the Hutt in the first film and a new musical number in Return of the Jedi ; an alteration involving the bounty hunter Greedo shooting at Han Solo drew significant ire . Further changes to the series were added to the 2004 DVD and the 2011 Blu @-@ ray releases – these changes also drew criticism . The final release of the original cuts was in 2006 , when unrestored masters used for the 1993 LaserDisc were added as a bonus feature to a limited run of DVDs under the name George 's Original <unk> Trilogy ( GOUT ) . In 2010 , Lucas stated that bringing the original cuts to Blu @-@ ray would be a " very , very expensive " process ; as of 2014 , the films are only widely available in their altered versions . 
 As a result of these changes , a group of fans met on various Internet forums to construct higher quality cuts as fan edits by using the available home media and blending the Special Edition DVDs with the LaserDisc transfers . One such edit for The Empire Strikes Back was created by Star Wars fan <unk> .

 Petr Harmáček ( known online by the alias " Harmy " ) had watched a dubbed version of the original cut of Star Wars at the age of six , and had then seen the Special Editions of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi on their 1997 release . Although initially admiring them , he became disappointed when he learnt how much the films had been changed retroactively ; he argued that replacing the original effects with re @-@ composited digital effects was " an act of cultural vandalism " . A fan of the original trilogy , he had written his undergraduate thesis on their cultural impact . After seeing a trailer for <unk> 's cut of The Empire Strikes Back , Harmáček was inspired to create a version of the film that " undid " the post @-@ 1977 changes and restored the theatrical releases in high @-@ definition . He described his motivation as : " I wanted to be able to show people who haven 't seen Star Wars yet , like my little brother or my girlfriend , the original , Oscar @-@ winning version , but I didn 't want to have to show it to them in bad quality .

 = Sense and Sensibility ( 2008 miniseries ) = 
 Sense and Sensibility is a 2008 British television drama adaptation of Jane Austen 's 1811 novel Sense and Sensibility . The screenplay was written by Andrew Davies , who revealed that the aim of the series was to make viewers forget Ang Lee 's 1995 film Sense and Sensibility . The series was " more overtly sexual " than previous Austen adaptations , and Davies included scenes featuring a seduction and a duel that were absent from the feature film . Sense and Sensibility was directed by John Alexander and produced by Anne <unk> . Hattie Morahan and Charity Wakefield star as Elinor and Marianne Dashwood , two sisters who go on " a voyage of burgeoning sexual and romantic discovery " . 
 The series was shot on location in the English counties of Berkshire , Surrey , Buckinghamshire and Devon for two months from April 2007 . Sense and Sensibility was co @-@ produced by the BBC and American studio WGBH Boston . It was aired in three parts from 1 January 2008 in the United Kingdom and attracted an average of 6 million viewers per episode .

 When Henry Dashwood ( Simon Williams ) dies , he leaves his entire fortune and his home , Norland Park , to his son John ( Mark Gatiss ) . John promises that he will provide for his stepmother , Mrs. Dashwood ( Janet McTeer ) , and half @-@ sisters Elinor ( Hattie Morahan ) , Marianne ( Charity Wakefield ) , and Margaret ( Lucy Boynton ) . However , John 's wife , Fanny ( Claire Skinner ) , convinces him to give the family a smaller inheritance than he had intended . Fanny 's brother , Edward Ferrars ( Dan Stevens ) , comes to visit , and he quickly befriends Elinor . While Mrs. Dashwood hopes they will become engaged , Fanny informs her that his mother will not approve the match . Mrs. Dashwood receives a letter from her cousin , Sir John Middleton ( Mark Williams ) , offering her a small cottage house on his estate , Barton Park in Devonshire . She and her daughters decide to leave Norland immediately . 
 During a welcome dinner at Barton Park , Sir John introduces the Dashwoods to his wife , Lady Middleton ( Rosanna Lavelle ) ; her mother , Mrs. Jennings ( Linda Bassett ) ; and their family friend , Colonel Brandon ( David Morrissey ) . Brandon instantly falls in love with Marianne , but she believes he is too old for her . While out walking with Margaret , Marianne falls and twists her ankle . She is rescued by a young man , who carries her back to the cottage . He introduces himself as John Willoughby ( Dominic Cooper ) , and states that he will return to check on Marianne the following day . Brandon also comes to visit , but upon seeing Willoughby , he quickly departs . Willoughby and Marianne grow close through their mutual love of poetry , and he later takes a lock of her hair . Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor begin to speculate on whether they have become secretly engaged .

Willoughby requests a private audience with both Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne , leading them both to expect that he will propose . However , Willoughby reveals that his aunt is sending him on business to London , and he may not be able to return to Devonshire for at least a year . Shortly after Willoughby 's departure , Edward comes to visit , and the Dashwoods notice that he appears to be unhappy and distant . Mrs. Jennings ' nieces , Lucy ( Anna Madeley ) and Anne Steele ( Daisy Haggard ) , come to Barton Park . When Lucy learns that the Dashwoods are acquainted with the Ferrars , Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been secretly engaged for four years , news that devastates Elinor .

 On 5 October 2005 , a reporter for the BBC News revealed that writer Andrew Davies was planning to adapt Jane Austen 's Sense and Sensibility into a major television drama due to be broadcast on the BBC in two years . Davies commented , " When they are great stories , you keep on coming back to them and doing them in different ways with different people at different lengths . " Davies explained that his script was in the early stages and that no actors had yet been cast . The writer later expressed his delight at adapting the novel during an interview with Paul Carey from the Western Mail , calling Austen his " favourite novelist " . He also admitted that due to the acclaim he received for his adaptation of Pride and Prejudice , there was pressure on him to get Sense and Sensibility right . Davies later stated that the aim of the miniseries was to make viewers forget about Ang Lee 's 1995 film adaptation of the novel . 
 The opening episode of Sense and Sensibility features the moment Willoughby seduces Eliza , a young schoolgirl . Davies told Carey and Claire Hill from the Western Mail that he wanted " to do justice " to Willoughby 's back story , saying that it is " quite interesting and steamy stuff like a lot of underage sex that goes on and is just talked about . I want to put it on the screen . " Davies elaborated on this further in an interview with The Independent 's Peter Chapman , saying that the seduction and abandonment of a schoolgirl in the novel needed dramatising . He believed readers " hardly notice " the moment , which he felt was very important . The writer noted that the series was " more overtly sexual " than previous adaptations of Austen 's works and added , " The novel is as much about sex and money as social conventions . " Davies also included a duel between Colonel Brandon and Willoughby in his screenplay , an event that was absent from Lee 's film adaptation of the novel . 
 Davies believed that Lee 's film did not overcome " the problem of the guys who get the girls not seeming quite good enough " , and set out to try to find a way of making them into heroes in his script . He said that Austen should have made the reader feel that Edward was worthy of Elinor and explained how Marianne falls in love with Colonel Brandon , after having her heart broken by Willoughby . The writer increased the male roles , so they could be turned into stronger characters . Davies told Hill that the team " worked very hard " on the men . Brandon is seen rescuing people and doing a lot of fast horse riding , while Edward was given a wood @-@ chopping scene where he vents his frustrations about his engagement . Davies also made the Dashwood sisters younger and " more vulnerable " than how they were portrayed in Lee 's film . Hattie Morahan , who portrayed Elinor in the drama , stated , " We are trying to play the story as it was written . In the novel the girls are 19 and 17 , so these romantic relationships are real rites of passage for them . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Davies commented that he would have liked to have been in charge of the casting . He revealed that he had initially objected to Hattie Morahan being cast in the role of the eldest Dashwood sister , Elinor . However , he was glad that his objections were ignored , because he fell in love with her performance . Morahan told The Daily Telegraph 's Jasper Rees that she deliberately chose not to watch the 1995 film adaptation of Sense and Sensibility or think about Emma Thompson 's portrayal of the character . She explained that she had not " [ b ] ecause you would go mad . It would distort your work . I thought , it 'll be original by virtue of the fact that it 's me doing it and there is only one me . " 
 Charity Wakefield successfully auditioned for the role of Marianne Dashwood . The actress revealed , " Marianne is the embodiment of youth and hope . I was so excited to be offered the part because I felt that it was a role which I could really attack . I understand her character and feel that we have lots in common . " Dan Stevens was chosen to play Edward Ferrars , Elinor 's love interest . The actor revealed to a BBC journalist that he had really wanted the part and was excited by the challenge of the character . Stevens became ill with tonsillitis during the shoot , and quipped that there are very few shots of him in full health still in the series . 
 David Morrissey portrayed Colonel Brandon . The actor was sent the script by his agent , and he initially questioned whether another Austen adaptation was needed . However , he then read the script and thought it was " just brilliant " , especially as Davies had added more scenes featuring the male characters . Dominic Cooper took on the role of John Willoughby , Brandon 's rival for Marianne 's affections . Describing his character , Cooper said " The way I tried to persuade myself he wasn 't too bad was that he 's a 25 @-@ year @-@ old young guy and he genuinely falls in love with Marianne – he 's not just doing it for one moment in time . " Cooper said that he had fun working on the project . 
 Janet McTeer and Lucy Boynton were cast as Mrs Dashwood and Margaret Dashwood respectively . Mark Gatiss portrayed John Dashwood ; his casting was revealed in June 2007 . Claire Skinner received the role of John 's wife , Fanny , while Mark Williams was cast as Sir John Middleton . Linda Bassett and Jean Marsh were given the roles of Mrs Jennings and Mrs Ferrars respectively . Robert Bianco from USA Today commented that both women were " wonderfully cast " . Actresses Anna Madeley and Daisy Haggard portrayed Lucy Steele and her sister Anne , a character who was omitted from the 1995 film . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Sense and Sensibility was shot entirely on location within England , mostly in the counties of Berkshire , Surrey , Buckinghamshire , and Devon . Filming began in April 2007 and lasted until early June . Blackpool Mill , a fifteenth @-@ century cottage in north Devon , was turned into Barton Cottage , the home of the Dashwood girls . The art director for the series , James <unk> , had walked past the cottage in 2006 and thought it would be an ideal setting for a film . He was later sent back to the cottage by the location manager for Sense and Sensibility , and he decided the place would be right for the production . The owners of Blackpool Mill , Sir Hugh and Lady <unk> , were contacted in February 2007 by the BBC who inquired about the possibility of filming there . Caroline Gammell from The Daily Telegraph reported that " camera crews , production assistants , directors and actors swarmed over Blackpool Mill , turning the rustic four @-@ bedroom home into the romantic hub of Jane Austen 's novel . Set designers took the cottage more firmly into the 19th century , adding a porch at the front as well as dormer windows , fake shutters and an extra chimney . " The interior of cottage was " a little scruffy " for Mrs Dashwood 's status , so scenes featuring the inside of the cottage were filmed in a studio . Filming took place at the cottage over eight days in May . 
 Wakefield revealed that it rained constantly during filming , often soaking the cast and crew . However , the bad weather led to Davies writing in a scene featuring Edward in a wet shirt chopping logs in the rain , which rivalled the famous lake scene in Pride and Prejudice . Cooper told The Birmingham Post 's Georgina Rodgers that the bad weather affected his first scene , in which Willoughby carries an injured Marianne home . He explained that the scene was shot on a vertical slope with a rain machine , as the natural rain does not show up on camera . His cloak also kept getting caught under his foot , which made picking up Wakefield even harder . Cooper added , " I couldn 't move and I just kept falling head over heels . " Wrotham Park served as the exterior to Norland , the Dashwood family 's home . Ham House in Richmond was used for Norland 's interior shots , while the grounds were used for exterior scenes . The National Trust was asked not to cut the grass for several weeks before filming began . Ham House also doubled for Cleveland . <unk> Park was chosen for the exterior shots of Sir John Middleton 's home , Barton Park . The library doubled for Colonel Brandon 's own , while the entrance was used for scenes featuring a gathering of guests for a day out . The Oak Room was also used for the scenes involving Marianne , after she falls sick . Other filming locations included Dorney Court , Hall Barn , Lincoln 's Inn and Clovelly Pier . 
 = = = Costumes and make @-@ up = = = 
 The costume designer for Sense and Sensibility was Michele Clapton . She and assistant costume designer Alex Fordham undertook a large amount of research looking for inspiration . They spent hours looking at paintings and books from the time period , while also visiting art galleries and the Victoria and Albert Museum . During an interview for the drama 's BBC Online website , Fordham revealed that they tried to find references from every area , including eighteenth @-@ century cartoons . Clapton stated that the team wanted to make a lot of the costumes , rather than re @-@ use what was already available from other productions . To get the sense of colour that they wanted , they had to dye and create a lot of the pieces . The wardrobe team worked closely with the make @-@ up department and the production designer . After their first meeting , they came up with a colour palette for the whole show . Clapton chose to give Elinor and Marianne contrasting wardrobes . The " flighty " and " artistic " Marianne wears strong colours compared to Elinor , who has a different personality and complexion . Fordham revealed that with Marianne being younger and a " wild child " , her wardrobe contains a lot of Buttercup yellows , which suited Wakefield 's complexion and her character 's freshness . 
 Willoughby 's wardrobe was designed to reflect his " poetic " and " fashionable " nature , while Fordham believed Edward was more suited to the eighteenth @-@ century rural colours . With Colonel Brandon being a stronger character , his costumes were half way between the two . His clothes were designed to be out of date and firm , using more heathers instead of the rural colours . The production had an emphasis on youth and passion , which Clapton incorporated into her work . The designer said , " Ten years ago , female characters in 19th @-@ century dramas would all have their hair done in very precise ringlets , all neat and perfect just like in the portraits . Now we 're trying to achieve a more believable , natural look , especially when the Dashwoods are at home . " She added that the director had wanted the characters to " feel more human . " Morrissey commented that the period costumes were " slightly uncomfortable " for modern life , but as soon as the cast were riding horses or walking across fields , they realised why they were made that way . He added , " When you 're dancing , they 're quite restrictive , but that 's quite good for posture – posture was different then , and that 's important . But they give you a feel for the character which is really an advantage to you as an actor . " 
 Karen Hartley @-@ Thomas was the hair and make @-@ up designer for the production . She began prepping a couple of months before filming began , and she met with the director and producer early on to discuss the whole look of the film . Like the costumers , she read books and went to art galleries during her research . The female characters in Sense and Sensibility wear a " no make @-@ up look " because in the time period in which the film is set , only the lower classes would have worn white and pink make @-@ up . The Dashwood sisters wore no mascara and only a little corrective and blush . Hartley @-@ Thomas also used very little make @-@ up on the men , as she does not like them looking made up . Discussing the hair , Hartley @-@ Thomas said " Elinor 's hair is always quite neat and done , where Marianne , being a freer character and more rebellious , she has lots of different looks and lots of wild looks with the hair loose . " She also explained that some of the male actors wore wigs because the men in those days would have had a lot more volume to their hair , whereas the modern styles tend to be shorter and <unk> . John Dashwood and his son were given red hair , as Hartley @-@ Thomas wanted them to stand out amongst the more natural colours of the other male characters .

 Sense and Sensibility received mostly positive reviews from critics . However , the Jane Austen Society criticised it for being " too raunchy " and accused Davies of " degrading fine English literature " , after he included a seduction scene in the opening episode . The chairman of the society , Patrick Stokes , stated , " <unk> this story up says more about the BBC than Jane Austen . It is lowering itself by degrading fine English literature in the battle for ratings . While it is good that it draws people 's attention to her works , there is not a lot you can do if someone makes a hash of it . " A BBC spokesman believed the drama was not overtly sexual and stated that they had received no complaints about it , though they did get several calls from viewers expressing their appreciation for the series . 
 Melinda Houston , writing for The Age , called Sense and Sensibility " a gorgeous adaptation of her most frivolous work " and added , " It 's all beautifully made , beautifully cast , and the script snaps and crackles . Maybe Eleanor isn 't quite as flawed as originally drawn but that 's unlikely to detract from your enjoyment . " Lenny Ann Low from The Sydney Morning Herald stated , " The locations , costumes and acting are excellent , with a particularly striking use of light – cold and grey skies foretelling doom through to rich candlelight signalling new passions . " The New York Times critic Ginia Bellafante said , " There 's nothing glaringly wrong with this new Sense and Sensibility , the last in Masterpiece 's winter @-@ long homage to Austen ; it is both lush and tidy . But it alters the emotional chemistry , and the result is an adaptation that feels more arid than Mr. Lee 's effort . " 
 Nancy Banks @-@ Smith from The Guardian called Sense and Sensibility " a charmingly domestic and spontaneous treatment of the story " , adding that it had become " a younger sister " of Lee 's 1995 film . Variety 's Brian Lowry commented , " this latest Sense & Sensibility has done a splendid job casting its various roles , despite an inevitable wattage deficit compared with the most recent theatrical version . Davies and director John Alexander have also taken some liberties by crafting scenes of the men together ( something Austen herself never did ) – having the steely Brandon , for example , pull Willoughby aside to question his intentions toward Marianne . Featuring a top @-@ drawer cast , the filmmakers create several delicate moments – from Willoughby 's elegant seduction of Marianne to the stoic Elinor 's pining for the elusive Edward who , as played by Stevens , adorably stammers in a Hugh Grant @-@ like way . " 
 Serena Davies from The Daily Telegraph praised the first episode , calling it " faithful to the spirit of the book " and stating that the series " deftly stepped out of the shadows of two formidable predecessors : Ang Lee 's gorgeous 1995 film version of the novel , and scriptwriter Andrew Davies 's own masterpiece , Pride and Prejudice . " Davies enjoyed Morahan 's " luminous " performance as Elinor , as well as Williams and Morrissey 's turns as Sir John and Colonel Brandon respectively , although she thought the opening scene was " misconceived " . Davies ' colleague , James Walton , proclaimed , " In the end , this Sense and Sensibility was perhaps brilliantly competent rather than <unk> brilliant . Nevertheless , it still proved easily good enough to get the costume @-@ drama year off to a hugely enjoyable start . "

 The crew of Sense and Sensibility garnered several award nominations for their work on the drama . At the 14th Shanghai Television Festival , the series was nominated for Magnolia Award for Best Television Film or Miniseries , Alexander won the Best Television Film Director award , while Morahan won Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Film for her turn as Elinor Dashwood . Davies was nominated in the Writer 's Award category at the 35th Broadcasting Press Guild Awards for his screenplay , and Clapton received a nomination for Outstanding Costume Design for a Television Movie or Mini @-@ Series at the Costume Designers Guild Awards . For his work on the score , Phipps earned nominations for a BAFTA Television Craft Award for Best Original Television Music and a Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Miniseries , Movie or Special .

 = Marble Madness = 
 Marble Madness is an arcade video game designed by Mark Cerny and published by Atari Games in 1984 . The player uses a trackball to guide an onscreen marble through six obstacle @-@ filled courses within a time limit . Marble Madness was Atari 's first game to use the Atari System 1 hardware and to be programmed in the C programming language . It was also one of the first games to use true stereo sound ; previous games used either monaural sound or simulated stereo . 
 Cerny drew inspiration from miniature golf , racing games , and artwork by M. C. Escher . He applied a minimalist approach in designing the appearance of the game 's courses and enemies . 
 Marble Madness was commercially successful . The game was ported to numerous platforms and inspired the development of other games . A sequel was developed and planned for release in 1991 , but canceled when location testing showed the game could not compete with other titles . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Marble Madness is an isometric platform game in which the player manipulates an onscreen marble from a third @-@ person perspective . The player controls the marble 's movements with a trackball , though most home versions use game controllers with directional pads . The aim of the game is for the player to complete six maze @-@ like , isometric race courses before a set amount of time expires . With the exception of the first race , any time left on the clock at the end of a race is carried over to the next one , and the player is granted a set amount of additional time as well . The game allows two players to compete against each other , awarding bonus points and extra time to the winner of each race ; both players have separate clocks . 
 As the game progresses , the courses become increasingly difficult and introduce more enemies and obstacles . Each course has a distinct visual theme . For example , the first race ( titled " Practice " ) is a simple course that is much shorter than the others , while the fifth race ( named " Silly " ) features polka @-@ dot patterns and is oriented in a direction opposite that of the other courses . 
 = = Development = = 
 Marble Madness was developed by Atari Games , with Mark Cerny as the lead designer and Bob Flanagan as the software engineer . Both Cerny and Flanagan handled programming the game . It uses the Atari System 1 hardware , an interchangeable system of circuit boards , control panels , and artwork . The game features pixel graphics on a 19 inch <unk> <unk> model CRT monitor , and uses a Motorola <unk> central processing unit ( CPU ) with a MOS Technology 6502 subsystem to control the audio and coin operations . Marble Madness was Atari 's first game to use an FM sound chip produced by Yamaha , which is similar to a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer and creates the music in real time so that it is in synchronization with the game 's on @-@ screen action . The game 's music was composed by Brad Fuller and Hal Canon who spent a few months becoming familiar with the capabilities of the sound chip . 
 Cerny and Flanagan first collaborated on a video game based on Michael Jackson 's Thriller . The project was canceled and the two began working on an idea of Cerny 's that eventually became Marble Madness . Development lasted 10 months . Following the North American video game crash of 1983 , video game development within Atari focused on providing a distinctive experience through the use of a unique control system and by emphasizing a simultaneous two @-@ player mode . Cerny designed Marble Madness in accordance with these company goals . He was first inspired by miniature golf and captivated by the idea that a play field 's contours influenced the ball 's path . Cerny began testing various ideas using Atari 's digital art system . After deciding to use an isometric grid , Cerny began developing the game 's concept . His initial idea involved hitting a ball in a way similar to miniature golf , but Atari was unenthusiastic . Cerny next thought of racing games and planned for races on long tracks against an opponent . Technology limitations at the time were unable to handle the in @-@ game physics necessary for the idea , and Cerny switched the game 's objective to a race against time . 
 The development toolkit for the Motorola CPU included a compiler for the C programming language , which the two programmers were familiar with . After Atari had conducted performance evaluations , it approved usage of the language . Cerny and Flanagan 's decision to program Marble Madness in the C language had positive and negative consequences . Atari games had previously been programmed in assembly language . The C language was easier to program , but was less efficient , so the game operates at the slower speed of 30 Hz instead of the normal 60 Hz frequency of arcade games at the time . Cerny decided to use a trackball system ( marketed by Atari as Trak @-@ Ball ) to give the game a unique control system , and he chose a motorized trackball for faster spinning and braking when the in @-@ game ball traveled downhill and uphill , respectively . As it was building the prototypes , Atari 's design department informed Cerny that the motorized trackball 's design had an inherent flaw — one of the four supports had poor contact with the ball — and the use of a regular trackball was more feasible . Additionally , Cerny had anticipated the use of powerful custom chips that would allow RAM @-@ based sprites to be animated by the CPU , but the available hardware was a less @-@ advanced system using ROM @-@ based , static sprites . 
 These technical limitations forced Cerny to simplify the overall designs . Inspired by M. C. Escher , he designed abstract landscapes for the courses . In retrospect , Cerny partly attributed the designs to his limited artistic skills . He was a fan of the 3D graphics used in Battlezone and I , Robot , but felt that the visuals lacked definition and wanted to create a game with " solid and clean " 3D graphics . Unlike most other arcade games of the time , the course images were not drawn on the pixel level . Instead , Cerny defined the elevation of every point in the course , and stored this information in a heightmap array . The course graphics were then created by a ray tracing program that traced the path of light rays , using the heightmap to determine the appearance of the course on screen . This format also allowed Cerny to create shadows and use spatial anti @-@ aliasing , a technique that provided the graphics with a smoother appearance . Cerny 's course generator allowed him more time to experiment with the level designs . When deciding what elements to include in a course , practicality was a big factor ; elements that would not work or would not appear as intended were omitted , such as an elastic barricade or a teeter @-@ <unk> scale . Other ideas dropped from the designs were breakable glass supports , black hole traps , and bumps and obstacles built into the course that chased the marble . 
 Cerny 's personal interests changed throughout the project , leading to the inclusion of new ideas absent from the original design documents . The game 's enemy characters were designed by Cerny and Sam Comstock , who also animated them . Enemies had to be small in size due to technical limitations . Cerny and Comstock purposely omitted faces to give them unique designs and create a minimalistic appearance similar to the courses . Atari 's management , however , suggested that the marble should have a smiley face to create an identified character , similar to Pac @-@ Man . As a compromise , the cabinet 's artwork depicts traces of a smiley face on the marbles . Flanagan programmed a three @-@ dimensional physics model to dictate the marble 's motions and an interpreted script for enemy behavior . As Marble Madness neared completion , the feedback from Atari 's in @-@ house focus testing was positive . In retrospect , Cerny wished he had included more courses to give the game greater longevity , but extra courses would have required more time and increased hardware costs . Atari was experiencing severe financial troubles at the time and could not extend the game 's development period as it would have left their production factory idle . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Marble Madness was commercially successful following its December 1984 release and was positively received by critics . Around 4 @,@ 000 cabinets were sold , and it soon became the highest @-@ earning game in arcades . However , the game consistently fell from this ranking during its seventh week in arcades that Atari tracked the game 's success . Cerny attributed the six @-@ week arcade life to Marble Madness 's short gameplay length . He believed that players lost interest after mastering it and moved on to other games . The arcade cabinets have since become fairly rare . Stan <unk> holds the official world record of 187 @,@ 880 points . 
 Bruce Webster of BYTE wrote that the graphics of the Amiga version of Marble Madness in December 1986 " are really amazing " . While criticizing the lack of a pause function or a top scores list , he stated that it " is definitely worth having if you own an Amiga " . Many reviewers felt that the high level of skill required to play the game was part of its appeal . In 2008 , Levi Buchanan of IGN listed Marble Madness as one of several titles in his " dream arcade " , citing the game 's difficulty and the fond memories he had playing it . Author John Sellers wrote that difficulty was a major reason that players were attracted . Other engaging factors included the graphics , visual design , and the soundtrack . Retro Gamer 's Craig Grannell , in referring to the game as one of the most distinctive arcade games ever made , praised its visuals as " pure and timeless " . In 2008 , Guinness World Records listed it as the number seventy @-@ nine arcade game in technical , creative , and cultural impact . Marble Madness was one of the first games to use true stereo sound and have a recognizable musical score . British composer Paul Weir commented that the music had character and helped give the game a unique identity . A common complaint about the arcade cabinet was that the track ball controls frequently broke from repeated use . 
 Marble Madness inspired other games that feature similar gameplay based on navigating a ball through progressively more difficult courses ; such games are often described in terms that relate them to Marble Madness . Melbourne House 's Gyroscope and Electric Dreams Software 's Spindizzy were the first such games ; both met with a good reception . In 1990 , Rare released Snake Rattle ' n ' Roll , which incorporated elements similar to Marble Madness . The Super Monkey Ball series uses similar gameplay based on rolling a ball , but adds other features such as minigames and monkey characters . Archer Maclean 's Mercury also contains many elements similar to Marble Madness , but with minor variations , including the ability to change color , added hazards , and that the player controls a blob of liquid mercury rather than a marble . 
 = = = Ports and unreleased sequel = = = 
 Beginning in 1986 , the game was ported to numerous platforms with different companies handling the conversions ; several home versions were published by Electronic Arts , Tiger Electronics released handheld and tabletop LCD versions of the game , and it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System by Rare . Early versions featured simplified graphics , and the different ports were met with mixed reception . John Harris of Gamasutra thought the arcade 's popularity fueled the sales of the home versions , while Thomas Hanley of ScrewAttack commented that most versions were not as enjoyable without a track ball . Grannell echoed similar statements about the controls and added that many had poor visuals and collision detection . He listed the Amiga , Game Boy , and Sega Mega Drive ports as the better conversions , and the Sinclair ZX Spectrum , PC , and Game Boy Advance versions among the worst . Compute ! writers called the Amiga version 's graphics and gameplay " arcade @-@ quality " . Editors for Computer Gaming World stated that the Amiga version was superior to the arcade original , while the Commodore version had an extra level not present in other versions . Dragon 's three reviewers — Hartley , Patricia , and Kirk Lesser — praised the Apple IIGS port , calling it a " must have " title for arcade fans . MegaTech reviewers rated the Sega Mega Drive release a favorable 73 % . In 2003 , Marble Madness was included in the multi @-@ platform title Midway Arcade Treasures , a compilation of classic games developed by Williams Electronics , Midway Games , and Atari Games . Electronic Arts released a mobile phone port in 2010 that includes additional levels with different themes and new items that augment the gameplay . Marble Madness was also included in the 2012 multi @-@ platform compilation Midway Arcade Origins . A port of the game is also playable in Lego Dimensions via an Arcade Dock in the level " Prime Time " . 
 An arcade sequel titled Marble Man : Marble Madness II was planned for release in 1991 , though Cerny was uninvolved in the development . Development was led by Bob Flanagan who designed the game based on what he felt made Marble Madness a success in the home console market . Because the market 's demographic was a younger audience , Flanagan wanted to make the sequel more accessible and introduced , ball like a superhero ( a.k.a. Marble Man ) . Marble Man expanded on the gameplay of the original game by featuring new abilities for the marble such as Heli , Cloak , <unk> , and Crusher , included pinball minigames between sets of levels , and allowed up to three players to traverse isometric courses . Its final wave is called " King of the Mountain " . Flanagan intended to address the short length of the first game and , with the help of Mike Hally , developed seventeen courses . 
 Atari created prototypes for location testing , but the game did not fare well against more popular titles at the time such as Street Fighter II . Atari assumed the track balls accounted for the poor reception and commissioned a second model with joystick controls . Because the new models were met with the same poor reception , production was halted and the focus shifted to Guardians of the ' Hood , a beat ' em up game . The prototypes that were produced have since become collector items . 
 = Adolf Eichmann = 
 Otto Adolf Eichmann ( pronounced [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ̯ <unk> ] ; 19 March 1906 – 1 June 1962 ) was a German Nazi SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer ( lieutenant colonel ) and one of the major organisers of the Holocaust . Eichmann was tasked by SS @-@ Obergruppenführer ( general / lieutenant general ) Reinhard Heydrich with facilitating and managing the logistics of mass deportation of Jews to ghettos and extermination camps in German @-@ occupied Eastern Europe during World War II . In 1960 , he was captured in Argentina by Mossad , Israel 's intelligence service . Following a widely publicised trial in Israel , he was found guilty of war crimes and hanged in 1962 . 
 After an unremarkable school career , Eichmann briefly worked for his father 's mining company in Austria , where the family had moved in 1914 . He worked as a travelling oil salesman beginning in 1927 , and joined the Nazi Party and SS in 1932 . After returning to Germany in 1933 , he joined the Sicherheitsdienst ( SD ; Security Service ) , where he was appointed head of the department responsible for Jewish affairs — especially emigration , which the Nazis encouraged through violence and economic pressure . After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , Eichmann and his staff arranged for Jews to be concentrated into ghettos in major cities with the expectation they would be transported farther east or overseas . Eichmann drew up plans for a Jewish reservation , first at Nisko in south @-@ east Poland and later in Madagascar , but neither of these plans were ever carried out . 
 As the Nazis began the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 , their Jewish policy changed from emigration to extermination . To co @-@ ordinate planning for the genocide , Heydrich hosted the regime 's administrative leaders at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942 . Eichmann collected information for Heydrich , attended the conference , and prepared the minutes . Eichmann and his staff became responsible for Jewish deportations to extermination camps , where the victims were gassed . After Germany invaded Hungary in March 1944 , Eichmann oversaw the deportation of much of that country 's Jewish population . Most of the victims were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp , where 75 to 90 per cent were murdered upon arrival . By the time the transports were stopped in July 1944 , 437 @,@ 000 of Hungary 's 725 @,@ 000 Jews had been killed . Historian Richard J. Evans estimates that between 5 @.@ 5 and 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis . Eichmann said towards the end of the war that he would " leap laughing into the grave because the feeling that he had five million people on his conscience would be for him a source of extraordinary satisfaction . " 
 After Germany 's defeat in 1945 , Eichmann fled to Austria . He lived there until 1950 , when he moved to Argentina using false papers . Information collected by the Mossad , Israel 's intelligence agency , confirmed Eichmann 's location in 1960 . A team of Mossad and Shin Bet agents captured Eichmann and brought him to Israel to stand trial on 15 criminal charges , including war crimes , crimes against humanity and crimes against the Jewish people . Found guilty on many of these charges , he was sentenced to death by hanging and executed on 1 June 1962 . The trial was widely followed in the media and was later the subject of several books , including Hannah Arendt 's work Eichmann in Jerusalem , in which Arendt coined the phrase " the banality of evil " to describe Eichmann . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Otto Adolf Eichmann , the eldest of five children , was born in 1906 to a Calvinist Protestant family in Solingen , Germany . His parents were Adolf Karl Eichmann , a bookkeeper , and Maria ( née <unk> ) , a housewife . The elder Adolf moved to Linz , Austria , in 1913 to take a position as commercial manager for the Linz Tramway and Electrical Company , and the rest of the family followed a year later . After the death of Maria in 1916 , Eichmann 's father married Maria <unk> , a devout Protestant with two sons . 
 Eichmann attended the Kaiser Franz Joseph <unk> ( state secondary school ) in Linz , the same high school Adolf Hitler had attended some 17 years before . He played the violin and participated in sports and clubs , including a Wandervogel woodcraft and scouting group that included some older boys who were members of various right @-@ wing militias . His poor school performance resulted in his father withdrawing him from the Realschule and enrolling him in the Höhere <unk> für <unk> , Maschinenbau und <unk> vocational college . He left without attaining a degree and joined his father 's new enterprise , the <unk> Mining Company , where he worked for several months . From 1925 to 1927 he worked as a sales clerk for the <unk> <unk> AG radio company . Next , between 1927 and early 1933 , Eichmann worked in Upper Austria and Salzburg as district agent for the Vacuum Oil Company AG . 
 During this time , he joined the <unk> , the youth section of Hermann <unk> 's right @-@ wing veterans movement , and began reading newspapers published by the Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) . The party platform included removal of the Weimar Republic in Germany , rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , radical antisemitism , and anti @-@ Bolshevism . They promised a strong central government , increased Lebensraum ( living space ) for Germanic peoples , formation of a national community based on race , and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews , who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights . 
 = = Early career = = 
 On the advice of family friend and local Schutzstaffel ( SS ; protection squadron ) leader Ernst Kaltenbrunner , Eichmann joined the Austrian branch of the NSDAP , member number 889 @,@ 895 . He joined the Nazi Party on 1 April 1932 , and his membership in the SS was confirmed seven months later ( SS member number 45 @,@ 326 ) . His regiment was SS @-@ Standarte 37 , responsible for guarding the party headquarters in Linz and protecting party speakers at rallies , which would often become violent . Eichmann pursued party activities in Linz on weekends while continuing in his position at Vacuum Oil in Salzburg . 
 A few months after the Nazi seizure of power in Germany in January 1933 , Eichmann lost his job due to staffing cutbacks at Vacuum Oil . The Nazi Party was banned in Austria around the same time . These events were factors in Eichmann 's decision to return to Germany . 
 Like many other National Socialists fleeing Austria in the spring of 1933 , Eichmann left for Passau , where he joined Andreas Bolek at his headquarters . After he attended a training programme at the SS depot in <unk> in August , Eichmann returned to the Passau border in September , where he was assigned to lead an eight @-@ man SS liaison team to guide Austrian National Socialists into Germany and smuggle propaganda material from there into Austria . In late December , when this unit was dissolved , Eichmann was promoted to SS @-@ Scharführer ( squad leader , equivalent to corporal ) . Eichmann 's battalion of the Deutschland Regiment was quartered at barracks next door to Dachau concentration camp . 
 By 1934 , Eichmann requested transfer to the Sicherheitsdienst ( SD ; Security Service ) of the SS , to escape the " monotony " of military training and service at Dachau . Eichmann was accepted into the SD and assigned to the sub @-@ office on Freemasons , organising seized ritual objects for a proposed museum . After about six months , Eichmann was invited by Leopold von <unk> to join his Jewish Department , Section II / 112 of the SD , at its Berlin headquarters . Eichmann 's transfer was granted in November 1934 . He later came to consider this as his big break . He was assigned to study and prepare reports on the Zionist movement and various Jewish organisations . He even learned a smattering of Hebrew and Yiddish , gaining a reputation as a specialist in Zionist and Jewish matters . On 21 March 1935 Eichmann married Veronika ( Vera ) Liebl ( 1909 – 93 ) . The couple had four sons : Klaus ( b . 1936 in Berlin ) , Horst Adolf ( b . 1940 in Vienna ) , Dieter Helmut ( b . 1942 in Prague ) and Ricardo Francisco ( b . 1955 in Buenos Aires ) . Eichmann was promoted to SS @-@ <unk> ( head squad leader ) in 1936 and was commissioned as an SS @-@ Untersturmführer ( second lieutenant ) the following year . 
 Nazi Germany used violence and economic pressure to encourage Jews to leave Germany of their own volition ; around 250 @,@ 000 of the country 's 437 @,@ 000 Jews emigrated between 1933 and 1939 . Eichmann travelled to British Mandatory Palestine with his superior Herbert Hagen in 1937 to assess the possibility of Germany 's Jews voluntarily emigrating to that country , disembarking with forged press credentials at Haifa , whence they travelled to Cairo in Egypt . There they met <unk> <unk> , an agent of the Haganah , with whom they were unable to strike a deal . <unk> suggested that more Jews should be allowed to leave under the terms of the Haavara Agreement , but Hagen refused , surmising that a strong Jewish presence in Palestine might lead to their founding an independent state , which would run contrary to Reich policy . Eichmann and Hagen attempted to return to Palestine a few days later , but were denied entry after the British authorities refused them the required visas . They prepared a report on their visit , which was published in 1982 . 
 In 1938 , Eichmann was posted to Vienna to help organise Jewish emigration from Austria , which had just been integrated into the Reich through the Anschluss . Jewish community organisations were placed under supervision of the SD and tasked with encouraging and facilitating Jewish emigration . Funding came from money seized from other Jewish people and organisations , as well as donations from overseas , which were placed under SD control . Eichmann was promoted to SS @-@ Obersturmführer ( first lieutenant ) in July 1938 , and appointed to the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna , created in August . By the time he left Vienna in May 1939 , nearly 100 @,@ 000 Jews had left Austria legally , and many more had been smuggled out to Palestine and elsewhere .

 = = = Transition from emigration to deportation = = = 
 Within weeks of the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 , Nazi policy toward the Jews changed from voluntary emigration to forced deportation . After discussions with Hitler in the preceding weeks , on 21 September SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich , head of the SD , advised his staff that Jews were to be collected into cities in Poland with good rail links to facilitate their expulsion from territories controlled by Germany , starting with areas that had been incorporated into the Reich . He announced plans to create a reservation in the General Government ( the portion of Poland not incorporated into the Reich ) , where Jews and others deemed undesirable would await further deportation . On 27 September 1939 the SD and Sicherheitspolizei ( comprising the Gestapo and Kripo police agencies ) were combined into the new SS @-@ Reichssicherheitshauptamt ( RSHA ; Reich Main Security Office ) , which was placed under Heydrich 's control . 
 After a posting in Prague to assist in setting up an emigration office there , Eichmann was transferred to Berlin in October 1939 to command the Central Office for Jewish Emigration for the entire Reich under Heinrich Müller , head of the Gestapo . He was immediately assigned to organise the deportation of 70 @,@ 000 to 80 @,@ 000 Jews from Ostrava district in Moravia and Katowice district in the recently annexed portion of Poland . On his own initiative , Eichmann also laid plans to deport Jews from Vienna . Under the Nisko Plan , Eichmann chose Nisko as the location for a new transit camp where Jews would be temporarily housed before being deported elsewhere . In the last week of October 1939 , 4 @,@ 700 Jews were sent to the area by train and were essentially left to fend for themselves in an open meadow with no water and little food . Barracks were planned but never completed . Many of the deportees were driven by the SS into Soviet @-@ occupied territory and others were eventually placed in a nearby labour camp . The operation soon was called off , partly because Hitler decided the required trains were better used for military purposes for the time being . Meanwhile , as part of Hitler 's long @-@ range resettlement plans , hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans were being transported into the annexed territories , and ethnic Poles and Jews were being moved further east , particularly into the General Government . 
 On 19 December 1939 , Eichmann was assigned to head RSHA Referat IV B4 ( RSHA Sub @-@ Department IV @-@ B4 ) , tasked with overseeing Jewish affairs and evacuation . Heydrich announced Eichmann to be his " special expert " , in charge of arranging for all deportations into occupied Poland . The job entailed co @-@ ordinating with police agencies for the physical removal of the Jews , dealing with their confiscated property , and arranging financing and transport . Within a few days of his appointment , Eichmann formulated a plan to deport 600 @,@ 000 Jews into the General Government . The plan was stymied by Hans Frank , governor @-@ general of the occupied territories , who was disinclined to accept the deportees as to do so would have a negative impact on economic development and his ultimate goal of Germanisation of the region . In his role as minister responsible for the Four Year Plan , on 24 March 1940 Hermann Göring forbade any further transports into the General Government unless cleared first by himself or Frank . Transports continued , but at a much slower pace than originally envisioned . From the start of the war until April 1941 , around 63 @,@ 000 Jews were transported into the General Government . On many of the trains in this period , up to a third of the deportees died in transit . While Eichmann claimed at his trial to be upset by the appalling conditions on the trains and in the transit camps , his correspondence and documents of the period show that his primary concern was to achieve the deportations economically and with minimal disruption to Germany 's ongoing military operations . 
 Jews were concentrated into ghettos in major cities with the expectation that at some point they would be transported further east or even overseas . <unk> conditions in the ghettos — severe overcrowding , poor sanitation , and a lack of food — resulted in a high death rate . On 15 August 1940 , Eichmann released a memorandum titled Reichssicherheitshauptamt : <unk> Projekt ( Reich Main Security Office : Madagascar Project ) , calling for the resettlement to Madagascar of a million Jews per year for four years . When Germany failed to defeat the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain , the invasion of Britain was postponed indefinitely . As Britain still controlled the Atlantic and her merchant fleet would not be at Germany 's disposal for use in evacuations , planning for the Madagascar proposal stalled . Hitler continued to mention the Plan until February 1942 , when the idea was permanently shelved . 
 = = = Wannsee Conference = = = 
 From the start of the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 , Einsatzgruppen ( task forces ) followed the army into conquered areas and rounded up and killed Jews , Comintern officials , and ranking members of the Communist Party . Eichmann was one of the officials who received regular detailed reports of their activities . On 31 July , Göring gave Heydrich written authorisation to prepare and submit a plan for a " total solution of the Jewish question " in all territories under German control and to co @-@ ordinate the participation of all involved government organisations . The Generalplan Ost ( General Plan for the East ) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia , for use as slave labour or to be murdered . 
 Eichmann stated at his later interrogations that Heydrich told him in mid @-@ September that Hitler had ordered that all Jews in German @-@ controlled Europe were to be killed . The initial plan was to implement Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union . However , with the entry of the United States into the war in December and the German failure in the Battle of Moscow , Hitler decided that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war , which now had no end in sight . Around this time , Eichmann was promoted to SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer ( lieutenant colonel ) , the highest rank he achieved . 
 To co @-@ ordinate planning for the proposed genocide , Heydrich hosted the Wannsee Conference , which brought together administrative leaders of the Nazi regime on 20 January 1942 . In preparation for the conference , Eichmann drafted for Heydrich a list of the numbers of Jews in various European countries and prepared statistics on emigration . Eichmann attended the conference , oversaw the stenographer who took the minutes , and prepared the official distributed record of the meeting . In his covering letter , Heydrich specified that Eichmann would act as his liaison with the departments involved . Under Eichmann 's supervision , large @-@ scale deportations began almost immediately to extermination camps at Bełżec , Sobibor , Treblinka and elsewhere . The genocide was code @-@ named Operation Reinhard in honour of Heydrich , who died in Prague in early June from wounds suffered in an assassination attempt . Kaltenbrunner succeeded him as head of the RSHA . 
 Eichmann did not make policy , but acted in an operational capacity . Specific deportation orders came from Himmler . Eichmann 's office was responsible for collecting information on the Jews in each area , organising the seizure of their property , and arranging for and scheduling trains . His department was in constant contact with the Foreign Office , as Jews of conquered nations such as France could not as easily be stripped of their possessions and deported to their deaths . Eichmann held regular meetings in his Berlin offices with his department members working in the field and travelled extensively to visit concentration camps and ghettos . His wife , who disliked Berlin , resided in Prague with the children . Eichmann initially visited them weekly , but as time went on his visits tapered off to once a month . 
 = = = Hungary = = = 
 Germany invaded Hungary on 19 March 1944 . Eichmann arrived the same day , and was soon joined by top members of his staff and five or six hundred members of the SD , SS , and Sicherheitspolizei ( SiPo ; security police ) . Hitler 's appointment of a Hungarian government more amenable to the Nazis meant that the Hungarian Jews , who had remained essentially unharmed until that point , would now be deported to Auschwitz to serve as forced labour or be gassed . Eichmann toured northeastern Hungary in the last week of April and visited Auschwitz in May to assess the preparations . Round @-@ ups began on 16 April , and from 14 May , four trains of 3 @,@ 000 Jews per day left Hungary and travelled to the camp at Auschwitz II @-@ Birkenau , arriving along a newly built spur line that terminated a few hundred metres away from the gas chambers . Only between 10 and 25 per cent of the people on each train were chosen as forced labourers ; the rest were killed within hours of arrival . Under international pressure , the Hungarian government halted deportations on 6 July 1944 , by which time over 437 @,@ 000 of Hungary 's 725 @,@ 000 Jews had died . In spite of the orders to stop , Eichmann personally made arrangements for additional trains of victims to be sent to Auschwitz on 17 and 19 July . 
 In a series of meetings beginning on 25 April , Eichmann met with Joel Brand , a Hungarian Jew and member of the Relief and Rescue Committee ( RRC ) . Eichmann later testified that Berlin had authorised him to allow emigration of a million Jews in exchange for 10 @,@ 000 trucks equipped to handle the wintry conditions on the Eastern Front . Nothing came of the proposal , as the Western Allies refused to consider the offer . In June 1944 Eichmann was involved in negotiations with Rudolf Kasztner that resulted in the rescue of 1 @,@ 684 people , who were sent by train to safety in Switzerland in exchange for three suitcases full of diamonds , gold , cash , and securities . 
 Eichmann , resentful that Kurt Becher and others were becoming involved in Jewish emigration matters , and angered by Himmler 's suspension of deportations to the death camps , requested reassignment in July . At the end of August he was assigned to head a commando squad to assist in the evacuation of 10 @,@ 000 ethnic Germans trapped on the Hungarian border with Romania in the path of the advancing Red Army . The people they were sent to rescue refused to leave , so instead the soldiers helped evacuate members of a German field hospital trapped close to the front . For this Eichmann was awarded the Iron Cross , Second Class . Throughout October and November , Eichmann arranged for tens of thousands of Jewish victims to travel by forced marches in appalling conditions from Budapest to Vienna , a distance of 210 kilometres ( 130 mi ) . 
 On 24 December 1944 , Eichmann fled Budapest just before the Soviets completed their encirclement of the capital . He returned to Berlin , where he arranged for the incriminating records of Department IV @-@ B4 to be burned . Along with many other SS officers who fled in the closing months of the war , Eichmann and his family were living in relative safety in Austria when the war in Europe ended on 8 May 1945 . Historian Richard J. Evans estimates that 5 @.@ 5 to 6 million Jews , representing two @-@ thirds of the Jewish population of Europe , were exterminated by the Nazi regime . 
 = = After the Second World War = = 
 At the end of the Second World War , Eichmann was captured by the Americans and spent time in several camps for SS officers using forged papers that identified him as " Otto <unk> " . He escaped from a work detail at Cham when he realised that his actual identity had been discovered . He obtained new identity papers with the name of " Otto Heninger " and relocated frequently over the next several months . Moving to the Lüneburg Heath , he initially got work in the forestry industry and later leased a small plot of land in <unk> , where he lived until 1950 . Meanwhile , at the Nuremberg trials of major war criminals starting in 1946 , damning evidence about Eichmann 's activities was given by former commandant of Auschwitz Rudolf Höss and others . 
 In 1948 Eichmann obtained a landing permit for Argentina and false identification under the name of " Ricardo Klement " through an organisation directed by Bishop Alois Hudal , an Austrian cleric then residing in Italy with known Nazi sympathies . These documents enabled him in 1950 to obtain an International Committee of the Red Cross humanitarian passport and the remaining entry permits that would allow emigration to Argentina . He travelled across Europe , staying in a series of monasteries that had been set up as safe houses . Departing via ship from Genoa on 17 June 1950 , he arrived in Buenos Aires on 14 July . 
 Eichmann initially lived in Tucumán Province , where he worked for a government contractor . He sent for his family in 1952 , and they moved to Buenos Aires . Eichmann held a series of low @-@ paying jobs until finding employment at Mercedes @-@ Benz , where he rose to department head . The family built a house at 14 Garibaldi Street ( now 6061 Garibaldi Street ) and moved in during 1960 . 
 For four months beginning in late 1956 , Eichmann was extensively interviewed by Nazi expatriate journalist Willem Sassen with the intention of producing a biography . Tapes , transcripts , and handwritten notes by Eichmann were produced . The memoirs were later used as the basis for a series of articles that appeared in Life and Der Stern magazines in late 1960 . 
 = = Capture in Argentina = = 
 Several Jews and other survivors of the Holocaust dedicated themselves to finding Eichmann and other Nazis . Among them was the Jewish Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal . Wiesenthal learned from a letter shown to him in 1953 that Eichmann had been seen in Buenos Aires , and he passed along that information to the Israeli consulate in Vienna in 1954 . When Eichmann 's father died in 1960 , Wiesenthal made arrangements for private detectives to surreptitiously photograph members of the family , as Eichmann 's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance and there were no current photos of the fugitive . He provided these photographs to Mossad agents on 18 February . 
 Also instrumental in exposing Eichmann 's identity was Lothar Hermann , a German half @-@ Jew who had emigrated to Argentina in 1938 . When in 1956 Hermann 's daughter Sylvia began dating a man named Klaus Eichmann who boasted about his father 's Nazi exploits , Hermann alerted Fritz Bauer , prosecutor @-@ general of the state of Hesse in West Germany . Sylvia , sent on a fact @-@ finding mission , was met at the door by Eichmann himself , who said he was Klaus 's uncle . Informed that Klaus was not home , she sat down to wait . When Klaus returned , he addressed Eichmann as ' Father ' . In 1957 Bauer passed along the information in person to Mossad director Isser Harel , who assigned operatives to undertake surveillance , but no concrete evidence was initially found . On 1 March 1960 Harel dispatched to Buenos Aires the Shin Bet chief interrogator Zvi Aharoni , who over the course of weeks of investigation was able to confirm the identity of the fugitive . As Argentina had a history of turning down extradition requests for Nazi criminals , Israeli Prime Minister David Ben @-@ Gurion made the decision that Eichmann should be captured rather than extradited , and brought to Israel for trial . Harel himself arrived in person in May 1960 to oversee the capture . Mossad operative Rafi Eitan was named leader of the eight @-@ man team , most of whom were Shin Bet agents . 
 The team captured Eichmann near his home on Garibaldi Street in San Fernando , Buenos Aires , an industrial community 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) north of the centre of Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960 . The agents had arrived in Buenos Aires in April 1960 after Eichmann 's identity was confirmed . After observing the suspect 's routine for many days , they determined that he arrived home by bus from work at around the same time every evening . They planned to seize him when he was walking beside an open field from the bus stop to his house . The plan was almost abandoned on the designated day when Eichmann was not present on the bus he usually took home . Finally , almost half an hour late , Eichmann got off a bus . Mossad agent Peter Malkin engaged him , asking him in Spanish if he had a moment . Frightened , Eichmann attempted to leave , but two more Mossad men came to Malkin 's aid ; the three wrestled Eichmann to the ground and , after a struggle , conducted him to a car where they hid him on the floor under a blanket . 
 Eichmann was taken to one of several Mossad safe houses that had been set up by the team . He was held there for nine days , during which time his identity was double @-@ checked and confirmed . During these days , Harel tried to locate Josef Mengele , the notorious Nazi doctor from Auschwitz concentration camp , as the Mossad had information that he was also living in Buenos Aires . He was hoping to bring Mengele back to Israel on the same flight . Mengele had already left his last known residence in the city , and Harel was unable to get any leads on where he had gone , so the plans for his capture had to be abandoned . 
 Near midnight on 20 May , Eichmann was sedated by an Israeli doctor on the Mossad team and dressed as a flight attendant . He was smuggled out of Argentina aboard the same El Al Bristol Britannia aircraft that had a few days earlier carried Israel 's delegation to the official 150th anniversary celebration of Argentina 's independence from Spain . After a tense delay at the airport getting the flight plan approved , the plane took off for Israel , stopping over in Dakar , Senegal , to refuel . They arrived in Israel on 22 May , and Ben @-@ Gurion announced Eichmann 's capture to the Knesset — Israel 's parliament — the following afternoon . In Argentina , the abduction was met with a violent wave of antisemitism carried out by far @-@ right sectors , including the <unk> Nationalist Movement . 
 In June 1960 , after unsuccessful negotiations with Israel , Argentina requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to protest , as they regarded the capture as a violation of their sovereign rights . In the ensuing debate , the Israeli representative Golda Meir claimed that the abductors were not Israeli agents but private individuals and so the incident was only an " isolated violation of Argentine law " . On 23 June the Council passed Resolution 138 , which agreed that Argentine sovereignty had been violated and requested that Israel should make reparations . After further negotiations , on 3 August , Israel and Argentina issued a joint statement admitting the violation of Argentinian sovereignty but agreeing to end the dispute . In Eichmann 's trial and subsequent appeal , the Israeli court determined that the circumstances of his capture had no bearing on the legality of his trial . 
 Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) documents declassified in 2006 show that the capture of Eichmann caused alarm at the CIA and West German <unk> ( BND ) . Both organizations had known for at least two years where Eichmann was hiding , but did not act , because it did not serve their interests in the Cold War to do so . Both were concerned about what Eichmann might say in his testimony about West German national security advisor Hans Globke , who had coauthored several antisemitic Nazi laws ( including the Nuremberg Laws ) . The documents also revealed that both agencies had used some of Eichmann 's former Nazi colleagues to spy on European communist countries . 
 = = Trial = = 
 Eichmann was taken to a fortified police station at <unk> in Israel , where he spent nine months . The Israelis were unwilling to take him to trial based solely on the evidence in documents and witness testimony , so the prisoner was subject to daily interrogations , the transcripts of which totalled over 3 @,@ 500 pages . The interrogator was Chief Inspector Avner Less of the national police . Using documents provided primarily by Yad Vashem and Nazi hunter Tuviah Friedman , Less was often able to determine when Eichmann was lying or being evasive . When additional information was brought forward that forced Eichmann into admitting what he had done , Eichmann would insist he had not had any authority in the Nazi hierarchy and had only been following orders . Inspector Less noted that Eichmann did not seem to realise the enormity of his crimes and showed no remorse . His pardon plea , released in 2016 , did not contradict this : " There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders " , Eichmann wrote . " I was not a responsible leader , and as such do not feel myself guilty . " 
 Eichmann 's trial before the Jerusalem District Court began on 11 April 1961 . The legal basis of the charges against Eichmann was the 1950 Nazi and Nazi Collaborators ( Punishment ) Law , under which he was indicted on 15 criminal charges , including crimes against humanity , war crimes , crimes against the Jewish people , and membership in a criminal organisation . The trial was presided over by three judges : Moshe Landau , Benjamin Halevy and Yitzhak <unk> . The chief prosecutor was Israeli Attorney General Gideon Hausner , assisted by Gabriel Bach of the Department of Justice and Tel Aviv District Attorney Yaakov Bar @-@ Or . The defence team consisted of German lawyer Robert Servatius , legal assistant Dieter <unk> , and Eichmann himself . 
 The Israeli government arranged for the trial to have prominent media coverage . Capital Cities Broadcasting Corporation of the United States obtained exclusive rights to videotape the proceedings for television broadcast . Many major newspapers from all over the globe sent reporters and published front @-@ page coverage of the story . The trial was held at the Beit Ha 'am ( today known as the Gerard Behar Center ) , an auditorium in central Jerusalem . Eichmann sat inside a bulletproof glass booth to protect him from assassination attempts . The building was modified to allow journalists to watch the trial on closed @-@ circuit television , and 750 seats were available in the auditorium itself . Israelis had the opportunity to watch live television broadcasts of the proceedings , and videotape was flown daily to the United States for broadcast the following day . 
 The prosecution case was presented over the course of 56 days , involving hundreds of documents and 112 witnesses ( many of them Holocaust survivors ) . Hausner 's intention was to not only demonstrate Eichmann 's guilt but to present material about the entire Holocaust , thus producing a comprehensive record . Hausner 's opening address began , " It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historic trial and not the Nazi regime alone , but anti @-@ Semitism throughout history . " Defence attorney Servatius repeatedly tried to curb the presentation of material not directly related to Eichmann , and was mostly successful . In addition to wartime documents , material presented as evidence included tapes and transcripts from Eichmann 's interrogation and Sassen 's interviews in Argentina . In the case of the Sassen interviews , only Eichmann 's hand @-@ written notes were admitted into evidence . 
 Some of the evidence submitted by the prosecution took the form of depositions made by leading Nazis . The defence demanded that the men should be brought to Israel so that the defence 's right to cross @-@ examination would not be abrogated . But Hausner , in his role as Attorney General , declared that he would be obliged to arrest any war criminals who entered Israel . The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place , including Chełmno extermination camp , Auschwitz , and Minsk ( where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews ) , and therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed . 
 When the prosecution rested , the defence opened its case with a motion to dismiss based on the trial itself being illegal . Servatius challenged Eichmann 's kidnapping and the basis for the Israeli law under which he had been indicted . He argued that if the trial were to continue , it should transfer its jurisdiction to West Germany . The prosecution countered by stating that the United Nations had endorsed Israel 's actions , and that both West Germany and Argentina had agreed that the charges against him were legitimate . The defence motion was subsequently dismissed . 
 The defence next engaged in a lengthy direct examination of Eichmann . Observers such as Moshe Pearlman and Hannah Arendt have remarked on Eichmann 's ordinariness in appearance and flat affect . In his testimony throughout the trial , Eichmann insisted he had no choice but to follow orders , as he was bound by an oath of loyalty — the same superior orders defence used by some defendants in the 1945 – 1946 Nuremberg trials . Eichmann asserted that the decisions had been made not by him , but by Müller , Heydrich , Himmler , and ultimately Hitler . Servatius also proposed that decisions of the Nazi government were acts of state and therefore not subject to normal judicial proceedings . Regarding the Wannsee Conference , Eichmann stated that he felt a sense of satisfaction and relief at its conclusion . As a clear decision to exterminate had been made by his superiors , the matter was out of his hands ; he felt absolved of any guilt . On the last day of the examination , he stated that he was guilty of arranging the transports , but he did not feel guilty for the consequences . 
 Throughout his cross @-@ examination , prosecutor Hausner attempted to get Eichmann to admit he was personally guilty , but no such confession was forthcoming . Eichmann admitted to not liking the Jews and viewing them as adversaries , but stated that he never thought their annihilation was justified . When Hausner produced evidence that Eichmann had stated in 1945 that " I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that I have five million human beings on my conscience is for me a source of extraordinary satisfaction " , Eichmann said he meant " enemies of the Reich " such as the Soviets . During later examination by the judges , he admitted he meant the Jews , and said the remark was an accurate reflection of his opinion at the time . 
 The trial adjourned on 14 August , and the verdict was read on 12 December . The judges declared him not guilty of personally killing anyone and not guilty of overseeing and controlling the activities of the Einsatzgruppen . He was deemed responsible for the dreadful conditions on board the deportation trains and for obtaining Jews to fill those trains . He was found guilty of crimes against humanity , war crimes , and crimes against Poles , Slovenes and Gypsies . He was also found guilty of membership in three organisations that had been deemed criminal at the Nuremberg trials : the Gestapo , the SD , and the SS . When considering the sentence , the judges concluded that Eichmann had not merely been following orders , but believed in the Nazi cause wholeheartedly and had been a key perpetrator of the genocide . On 15 December 1961 , Eichmann was sentenced to death . 
 = = = Appeals and execution = = = 
 Servatius appealed the verdict , mostly relying on legal arguments about Israel 's jurisdiction and the legality of the laws under which Eichmann was charged . Appeal hearings took place between 22 and 29 March 1962 . Eichmann 's wife Vera flew to Israel and saw him for the last time at the end of April . On 29 May , the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the appeal and upheld the District Court 's judgement on all counts . Eichmann immediately petitioned Israeli President Yitzhak Ben @-@ Zvi for clemency . The content of his letter to the President pleading for pardon and other original court documents of the trial were made public on 27 January 2016 . Prominent people such as Hugo Bergmann , Pearl Buck , Martin Buber , and Ernst Simon spoke up on his behalf . Ben @-@ Gurion called a special cabinet meeting to resolve the issue . The cabinet decided not to recommend to President Ben @-@ Zvi to grant clemency to Eichmann . As a result , Ben @-@ Zvi rejected the appeal to commute Eichmann 's sentence . At 8 : 00 PM on 31 May , Eichmann was informed that his final appeal had been declined . His last meal was the usual prison fare of cheese , bread , olives , and tea , along with a half bottle of wine . 
 Eichmann was hanged at a prison in Ramla hours later — the hanging , scheduled for midnight at the end of 31 May , was slightly delayed and thus took place a few minutes into 1 June 1962 . The execution was attended by a small group of officials , four journalists and the Canadian clergyman William Lovell Hull , who had been his spiritual counselor while in prison . His last words were : 
 Long live Germany . Long live Argentina . Long live Austria . These are the three countries with which I have been most connected and which I will not forget . I greet my wife , my family and my friends . I am ready . We 'll meet again soon , as is the fate of all men . I die believing in God . 
 Within hours Eichmann 's body had been cremated , and his ashes scattered in the Mediterranean Sea , outside of Israeli territorial waters by an Israeli Navy patrol boat . 
 = = = Impact = = = 
 The trial and the surrounding media coverage sparked renewed interest in wartime events , and the resulting increase in publication of memoirs and scholarly works helped raise public awareness of the Holocaust . The trial received widespread coverage by the press in West Germany , and many schools added material studying the issues to their curriculum . In Israel , the testimony of witnesses at the trial led to a deeper understanding of the impact of the Holocaust on survivors , especially among younger citizens who had never suffered state @-@ sponsored oppression . 
 Political theorist Hannah Arendt , a Jew who fled Germany after Hitler 's rise to power , reported on Eichmann 's trial for The New Yorker . In Eichmann in Jerusalem , Arendt calls Eichmann the embodiment of the " banality of evil " , as he appeared to have an ordinary and normal personality , displaying neither guilt nor hatred . In his 1988 book Justice , Not Vengeance , Wiesenthal said : " The world now understands the concept of ' desk murderer ' . We know that one doesn 't need to be fanatical , sadistic , or mentally ill to murder millions ; that it is enough to be a loyal follower eager to do one 's duty . " In her 2011 book Eichmann Before Jerusalem , based largely on the Sassen interviews and Eichmann 's notes made while in exile , Bettina <unk> posits that Eichmann was proud of his wartime accomplishments , remained a committed Nazi throughout his life , and intentionally built a persona as a faceless bureaucrat for presentation at the trial . 
 Eichmann 's youngest son Ricardo says he is not resentful toward Israel for executing his father . He does not agree that his father 's " following orders " argument excuses his actions and notes how his father 's lack of remorse caused " difficult emotions " for the Eichmann family . Ricardo is now a professor of archaeology at the German Archaeological Institute . 
 In 2015 the filming of the trial by producer Milton <unk> and blacklisted TV director Leo Hurwitz was the subject of the UK television film The Eichmann Show , featuring Martin Freeman and Anthony LaPaglia . The film intercuts dramatic scenes with historical footage from the trial .

 Maryland Route 36 ( also known as MD 36 or Route 36 ) is a 29 @.@ 43 @-@ mile ( 47 @.@ 36 km ) state highway located in Allegany County , Maryland , United States . MD 36 's southern terminus is at the WV 46 bridge in Westernport and its northern terminus at U.S. Route 40 Alternate near Cumberland . Between Westernport and Frostburg , it is known as Georges Creek Road , and from Frostburg to Cumberland it is known as Mount Savage Road . Like the majority of Maryland state highways , MD 36 is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration ( MDSHA ) . 
 MD 36 serves as the main road through the Georges Creek Valley , a region which is historically known for coal mining , and has been designated by MDSHA as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway . MD 36 is the main road connecting the towns of Westernport , Lonaconing , and Midland in southwestern Allegany County , as well as Frostburg , Mount Savage , and Corriganville in northwestern Allegany County . 
 = = Route description = = 
 MD 36 has two main sections : Georges Creek Road , which runs along the Georges Creek Valley , from Westernport to Frostburg in southwestern Allegany County , and Mount Savage Road , which runs eastward from Frostburg to Cumberland in northwestern Allegany County . MD 36 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from I @-@ 68 to US 40 Alternate in Frostburg and from MD 35 at Corriganville to US 40 Alternate in Cumberland . 
 = = = Georges Creek Road = = = 
 MD 36 begins at the West Virginia Route 46 ( WV 46 ) bridge in Westernport and runs northeast across western Allegany County as a two @-@ lane road named Georges Creek Road , named for Georges Creek , a Potomac River tributary which the road parallels . The speed limit for most of the length between Westernport and Lonaconing is 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . A short distance outside Westernport city limits , MD 36 intersects MD 937 , an old alignment of MD 36 . Near Barton , MD 36 intersects MD 935 , which is the old alignment of MD 36 through Barton . MD 36 bypasses Barton , climbing the hillside above the Georges Creek Valley before descending back into the valley as it approaches Lonaconing . MD 935 returns to MD 36 south of Lonaconing , with its northern terminus at MD 36 . 
 As the road enters Lonaconing , it narrows and the speed limit drops to 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) , increasing to 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) after it travels through Lonaconing . MD 36 passes through Lonaconing as Main Street , and it intersects MD 657 near the center of Lonaconing . Along Main Street in Lonaconing is the Lonaconing Iron Furnace , a historic blast furnace which operated in the early 19th century . 
 MD 36 then continues toward Midland . At Midland , there is a sharp curve in the road , and the speed limit drops to 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) . Along this curve , MD 36 intersects Church Street , which connects to MD 936 , the old alignment of MD 36 between Midland and Frostburg . The new alignment of MD 36 proceeds northeast , passing near Vale Summit , where it intersects MD 55 . 
 North of the MD 55 intersection , MD 36 meets Interstate 68 at a diamond interchange at exit 34 . Near this interchange is God 's Ark of Safety , a church famous for its attempt to build a replica of Noah 's Ark . Between Midland and Frostburg , the speed limit is again 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , and there is a short section near the Interstate 68 interchange where MD 36 expands to four lanes . Upon entering Frostburg , MD 36 joins U.S. Route 40 Alternate as Main Street . MD 36 follows Main Street westward through Frostburg , meeting the northern terminus of MD 936 at Grant Street . At Depot Street , near the center of Frostburg , MD 36 connects to the western depot of the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad . At the intersection with Water Street , MD 36 leaves U.S. Route 40 Alternate , and upon leaving Frostburg city limits its name changes to Mount Savage Road . 
 = = = Mount Savage Road = = = 
 After leaving Frostburg , MD 36 is known as Mount Savage Road , as it travels eastward , perpendicular to its signed direction , toward Mount Savage . North of Eckhart Mines , MD 36 meets MD 638 , which connects MD 36 to U.S. Route 40 Alternate in Eckhart Mines . The road between Frostburg and Mount Savage is particularly curvy , and includes several hairpin turns near Frostburg . The speed limit on this section of the road is 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) . 
 As the road enters Mount Savage , it passes by the Mount Savage Castle , a Scottish @-@ style castle built in 1840 , which currently operates as a bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . In Mount Savage , the route narrows as it follows Main Street , and the road is frequently obstructed by parked cars , making it difficult for two cars to pass by each other . East of Mount Savage , the route widens and its speed limit gradually increases to 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . 
 In <unk> , MD 36 intersects MD 47 , which connects it with PA 160 in Somerset County . From its intersection with MD 47 to its terminus at Cumberland , MD 36 follows newer alignments , with the old alignments being designated MD 831 . At Corriganville , MD 36 intersects MD 35 , which connects it with PA 96 in Bedford County . MD 36 ends at U.S. Route 40 Alternate at the Narrows near Cumberland . 
 = = History = = 
 MD 36 passes through the Georges Creek Valley , which has a long history of coal mining . In recognition of this , the MDSHA has designated MD 36 as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway . Coal mining was a major industry in western Maryland in the 19th century , with railroads being the major route connecting the coal mines to markets outside the Georges Creek Valley . Deep mining , which was the primary mining method used in western Maryland , declined in use after World War II , replaced primarily by surface mining . Although Maryland coal production is now only a small fraction of total U.S. coal production , coal from the Georges Creek Valley is used to power the AES Warrior Run power plant in Cumberland . 
 MD 36 was assigned a route number before 1927 , earlier than most of the other Maryland state highways . The original alignment of MD 36 in southern Allegany County closely paralleled the Georges Creek Railroad . Later realignments have shifted MD 36 away from the railroad in several locations , but three crossings remain : one north of Lonaconing , one south of Lonaconing near the MD 935 intersection , and a third crossing near Westernport . 
 Over the years , multiple new alignments of MD 36 have been built for various reasons , such as to smooth out curves in the road . Several of the old alignments have been assigned route numbers of their own . The southernmost of these is MD 937 , which consists of the old alignment through Westernport . Prior to the construction of the bridge connecting MD 36 to WV 46 , MD 937 was the alignment of MD 36 through Westernport , ending at MD 135 . In Barton , MD 935 carries the old alignment of MD 36 . The longest of the old alignment sections is MD 936 , which runs from Midland to Frostburg , and was bypassed in the 1970s with a new alignment of MD 36 following part of MD 55 and connecting to Interstate 68 . Prior to this change , MD 55 ended in Midland ; it has since been truncated to its current terminus at Vale Summit . 
 North of Frostburg , several old alignments are designated as MD 831 , though these segments of road are not signed . Among these segments of road are <unk> Road ( designated as MD <unk> ) , and Old Mount Savage Road ( designated as MD <unk> ) . <unk> Road splits from MD 36 west of Corriganville and runs through Corriganville , returning to MD 36 east of the town . Old Mount Savage Road intersects MD 36 west of the Cumberland Narrows , and runs southward to intersect U.S. Route 40 Alternate near its current intersection with MD 36 .

 = Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ( U.S. game show ) = 
 Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ( often informally called Millionaire ) is an American television game show based on the same @-@ titled British program and developed for the United States by Michael Davies . The show features a quiz competition in which contestants attempt to win a top prize of U.S. $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 by answering a series of multiple @-@ choice questions of increasing difficulty ( although , for a time , most of the questions were of random difficulty ) . The program has endured as one of the longest @-@ running and most successful international variants in the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? franchise . 
 The original U.S. version aired on ABC from August 16 , 1999 to June 27 , 2002 , and was hosted by Regis Philbin . The daily syndicated version of the show began airing on September 16 , 2002 , and was hosted for eleven seasons by Meredith Vieira until May 31 , 2013 . Later hosts included Cedric the Entertainer in the 2013 – 14 season , Terry Crews in the following season ( 2014 – 15 ) , and Chris Harrison , who began hosting on September 14 , 2015 . 
 As the first U.S. network game show to offer a million @-@ dollar top prize , the show made television history by becoming one of the highest @-@ rated game shows in the history of American television . The U.S. Millionaire has won seven Daytime Emmy Awards , and TV Guide ranked it # 6 in its 2013 list of the 60 greatest game shows of all time . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 = = = Core rules = = = 
 At its core , the game is a quiz competition in which the goal is to correctly answer a series of fourteen ( originally fifteen ) consecutive multiple @-@ choice questions . The questions are of increasing difficulty , except in the 2010 – 15 format overhaul , where the contestants were faced with fourteen questions of random difficulty , distributed into two rounds . Each question is worth a specified amount of money ; the amounts are cumulative in the first round , but not in the second . If the contestant gives a wrong answer to any question , their game is over and their winnings are reduced to $ 1 @,@ 000 for tier @-@ one questions , $ 5 @,@ 000 for tier @-@ two questions , and $ 50 @,@ 000 for tier @-@ three questions . However , the contestant has the option of " walking away " without giving an answer after being presented with a question , in which case the game ends and the contestant is guaranteed to walk away with all the money they have previously received . With the exception of the shuffle format , upon correctly answering questions five and ten , contestants are guaranteed at least the amount of prize money associated with that level . If the contestant gives an incorrect answer , their winnings drop down to the last milestone achieved . Since 2015 , if the contestant answers a question incorrectly before reaching question five , he or she leaves with $ 1 @,@ 000 . Prior to the shuffle format , a contestant left with nothing if he or she answered a question incorrectly before reaching the first milestone . In the shuffle format era , contestants who incorrectly answered a question had their winnings reduced to $ 1 @,@ 000 in round one and $ 25 @,@ 000 in round two .

 On the ABC versions , ten contestants competed in a preliminary " Fastest Finger " round for the right to play the main game on each episode . The contestants were presented with a question and a list of four answers which needed to be put in a specific order . Using keys on their podiums , each of the contestants attempted to enter the correct order in the shortest amount of time , with a maximum time limit of 20 seconds . If the main game ended and there was still time available for another game , the remaining contestants played another Fastest Finger round for a chance to play the main game . In the event of a tie between two or more contestants , those contestants played an additional Fastest Finger question to break the tie . If all contestants answered the question incorrectly , the round was repeated with another question . Fastest Finger was eliminated from the gameplay when the syndicated version premiered in 2002 . 
 From 2008 to 2010 , time limits were used for each question . Contestants were given up to 15 seconds each for questions one through five , 30 seconds each for questions six through ten , and 45 seconds each for questions eleven through fourteen . Unused time was banked , and if the contestant reached question fifteen , he or she was given 45 seconds plus however much time that was previously banked . If the clock reached zero before a contestant could provide a final answer , the contestant was forced to walk away with the winnings they had at that point . During the clock format era , a " Millionaire Menu " was introduced , in which categories are revealed for each question at the beginning of the game , and are made visible to the contestant for their future reference . Some prize levels also changed at the start of season eight . Most of the episodes in season eight ( from the " Million Dollar Tournament of Ten " onward ) featured special " Celebrity Questions " that were mid @-@ level in monetary value , and were provided by notable individuals whose identities were not revealed until the contestant reached their special questions . 
 When the ninth syndicated season began on September 13 , 2010 , the format was overhauled . Ten questions were asked in round one , each assigned one of ten different money amounts which were randomized at the beginning of the game ; in this case , the difficulty of the questions was not tied to the dollar value . The dollar values for each question remained hidden until a contestant either provided a correct answer or chose to " jump " the question . The value of each question answered correctly was added to the contestant 's bank , for a maximum total of $ 68 @,@ 600 . A contestant who completed the round successfully could walk at any subsequent point with all the money in their bank , or could walk without completing the round with half that amount ( e.g. , a contestant who banked $ 30 @,@ 000 would leave with $ 15 @,@ 000 ) . After completing round one , the contestant moved on to a second round of gameplay ( the " Classic Millionaire " round ) , in which four non @-@ categorized questions were played for set non @-@ cumulative values and a correct answer augmented the contestant 's winnings to that point , as in the older formats . The shuffle format changes , including the randomization and double @-@ round distribution of questions , were reverted for the fourteenth syndicated season . 
 From 2011 to 2014 , certain weeks of the show were designated as " Double Your Money " weeks . In those , a certain question in round one was designated the " Double Money Question . " When a contestant answered such a question correctly , the monetary value behind the question was doubled and added to his or her bank , giving him or her the possibility of adding up to a maximum of $ 50 @,@ 000 to his or her bank on a single question ; under these special rules , it was possible for a contestant to finish round one with a maximum total of $ 93 @,@ 600 in their bank . However , when a contestant " jumped " the question , they forfeited the doubled money . 
 In the event that a contestant leaves and very little time remains , a randomly selected audience member is given one chance to win $ 1 @,@ 000 by answering the next question intended for the previous contestant ( or $ 2 @,@ 000 if the next question was on a Double Money episode ) . Regardless of the outcome , the audience member receives a special prize . In seasons nine and ten , the prize was a copy of the Millionaire video game ; as of season eleven , audience members now receive 20 free playings for a Facebook game based on the show 's format . In season thirteen , which gave this game the name " <unk> " , the question the audience player faced did not come from the previous player 's stack , but was instead a separate question . Season thirteen also introduced two additional audience games : " Team Millionaire " , where two audience members are both presented with a single question and lock in their individual answers separately for the chance to win $ 500 and a bonus question with which they can double their money ; and " Fastest Feet " , a variation of Fastest Finger which four audience members play for the chance to split $ 1 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Payout structure = = = 
 For the first five years of the U.S. Millionaire 's existence , the payout structure was as follows : first going from $ 100 to $ 300 in increments of $ 100 , then from $ 500 to $ 64 @,@ 000 with the dollar value for each new question being double that of the one before it , and finally from $ 125 @,@ 000 to $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 with the dollar values doubling for each new question . At the start of the third syndicated season the values for questions ten through twelve were changed from $ 32 @,@ 000 , $ 64 @,@ 000 , and $ 125 @,@ 000 to $ 25 @,@ 000 , $ 50 @,@ 000 , and $ 100 @,@ 000 respectively . The 2004 payout structure endured until the eighth syndicated season , when after the ninth contestant from the 2009 primetime revival played , a new payout structure was implemented in which the dollar values first went from $ 500 to $ 2 @,@ 000 with the dollar value of each new question being double that of the previous one , then to $ 3 @,@ 000 , then from $ 5 @,@ 000 to $ 15 @,@ 000 in increments of $ 2 @,@ 500 ; the dollar values of questions ten through fifteen remained unchanged . In the shuffle format era , the ten questions in round one had random values which included $ 100 , $ 500 , $ 1 @,@ 000 , $ 2 @,@ 000 , $ 3 @,@ 000 , $ 5 @,@ 000 , $ 7 @,@ 000 , $ 10 @,@ 000 , $ 15 @,@ 000 , and $ 25 @,@ 000 ; the final four questions , in round two , retained their 2004 values . For the 2015 – 16 season , the first five questions follow the payout structure used from 2009 to 2010 , while the dollar value of each new question for the next five questions is $ 7 @,@ 000 , $ 10 @,@ 000 , $ 20 @,@ 000 , $ 30 @,@ 000 and $ 50 @,@ 000 ; the money values for the last four questions remain unchanged . The second safe haven is $ 50 @,@ 000 at question 10 , with the first one still $ 5 @,@ 000 . 
 The $ 500 @,@ 000 and $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 prizes were initially lump @-@ sum payments , but were changed to annuities in September 2002 when the series moved to syndication . Contestants winning either of these prizes receive $ 250 @,@ 000 thirty days after their show broadcasts and the remainder paid in equal annual payments . The $ 500 @,@ 000 prize consists of $ 25 @,@ 000 per year for 10 years , while the $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 prize consists of $ 37 @,@ 500 per year for 20 years . 
 = = = Lifelines = = = 
 Contestants are given a series of lifelines to aid them with difficult questions . They can use as many lifelines as desired per question , but each lifeline can only be used once per game . Three lifelines are available from the start of the game . Depending on the format of the show , additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question . In the clock format , usage of lifelines temporarily paused the clock while the lifelines were played . 
 The show 's original three lifelines were " 50 : 50 " , in which the computer eliminates two of the incorrect answers ; " Phone @-@ a @-@ Friend " , which allowed the contestant to make a 30 @-@ second call to one of a number of friends ( who provided their phone numbers in advance ) and read them the question and answer choices , after which the friend provided input ; and " Ask the Audience " , in which audience members use touch pads to designate what they believe the correct answer to be , after which the percentage of the audience choosing each specific option is displayed to the contestant . 50 : 50 was eliminated at the end of the show 's sixth syndicated season , only to be restored in season fourteen . Phone @-@ a @-@ Friend was removed on the episode aired January 11 , 2010 , after it was determined that there was an increasing trend of contestants ' friends using search engines and other Internet resources , unfairly privileging individuals who had computer access over those who did not , and that it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline where friends were supposed to provide assistance based on what they already knew . From 2004 to 2008 , there was a fourth lifeline called " Switch the Question " , earned upon answering question ten , in which the computer replaced , at the contestant 's request , one question with another of the same monetary value ; however , any lifelines used on the original question were not reinstated for the new question . Switch the Question returned as " Cut the Question " on a special week of shows with child contestants aired in 2014 . 
 During the Super Millionaire spin @-@ off , two new lifelines were introduced : " Double Dip " , which allowed the contestant to make two guesses at a question , but required them to play out the question , forbidding them to walk away or use any further lifelines ; and " Three Wise Men " , in which the contestant was allowed to ask a sequestered panel of three people chosen by the producers , appearing via face @-@ to @-@ face audio and video feeds , which answer they believed was correct , within a time limit of 30 seconds . When the clock format was implemented , Double Dip replaced 50 : 50 , and the show introduced a new lifeline called " Ask the Expert " , which was like Three Wise Men but had one person ( usually a celebrity or a former Millionaire contestant ) functioning as an expert instead of a panel of three people , lacked the time limit of its predecessor , and allowed the contestant and expert to discuss the question . Ask the Expert was originally available after the fifth question , but was moved to the beginning of the game after Phone @-@ a @-@ Friend was removed . 
 The show 's lifelines sometimes used corporate sponsorship . The Phone @-@ a @-@ Friend lifeline was sponsored by the original AT & T throughout the run of the ABC primetime show and in the first season of the syndicated version , then by the current AT & T for the 2009 primetime episodes . From 2004 to 2006 , Ask the Audience was sponsored by AOL , which allowed users of its Instant Messenger to add the screen name <unk> to their buddy list and receive an instant message with the question and the four possible answers , to which the users replied with their choices . In addition , the Ask the Expert lifeline was sponsored by Skype for its live audio and video feeds . 
 During the shuffle format era , the show introduced a new lifeline , " Jump the Question " , which was able to be used twice in a single game for seasons nine through twelve . At any point prior to selecting a final answer , a contestant could use Jump the Question to skip the current question and move on to the next one , thus reducing the number of questions they had to correctly answer . However , if the contestant used Jump the Question , they did not gain any money from the question they chose to skip ( for example , a contestant would not gain the typical $ 100 @,@ 000 if they jumped to the $ 250 @,@ 000 question ) . This lifeline could not be used on the $ 1 million question , since it is the final question in the game . The " Plus One " lifeline , introduced in season thirteen , allows a contestant to bring a companion with him or her to the podium for help in answering a question . The introduction of this lifeline reduced the number of Jump the Question lifelines available from two to one . On occasional specially designated weeks , starting with a Halloween @-@ themed week that aired from October 29 to November 2 , 2012 , the shuffle format used a special lifeline called " Crystal Ball " , which allows the contestant to see the money value of a round one question prior to giving an answer . Jump the Question was removed at the end of the show 's thirteenth syndicated season . For the show 's fourteenth season , during a special week of college shows , players got another lifeline called " Extra Help " , played similarly to " Plus One " and allowing for another companion to help the player ; however , it could only be used after " Plus One " was used . 
 = = = Top prize winners = = = 
 The first contestant to correctly answer all 15 questions and win the top prize of $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 was John Carpenter , on the episode aired November 19 , 1999 . In 2000 , the million dollar top prize was awarded five times : to Dan Blonsky on the episode aired January 18 , to Joe <unk> on March 23 , to Bob House on June 13 , to Kim Hunt on July 6 , and to David Goodman on July 11 . 
 In January 2001 , when no contestant had won $ 1 million in any show that aired over a period of five months , the top prize was then changed from a flat $ 1 million to an accumulating jackpot that increased by $ 10 @,@ 000 for each episode where the top prize was not won . On April 10 , 2001 , Kevin Olmstead correctly answered the final question and won $ 2 @,@ 180 @,@ 000 , making him the biggest winner in television history at the time . The top prize for correctly answering the final question returned to $ 1 million following Olmstead 's win and has remained unchanged since ; just five days after Olmstead 's win , the standard $ 1 million prize was awarded to Bernie Cullen . The last top prize winner on the original network version was Ed Toutant , on the episode aired September 7 , 2001 ; he had previously appeared on the episode aired January 31 , 2001 , where he was ruled to have answered his $ 16 @,@ 000 question incorrectly , but when it was discovered that there was a mistake in that question , Toutant was invited back and won a $ 1 @.@ 86 million jackpot . On the Super Millionaire spin @-@ off , Robert Essig won $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 after answering the twelfth question and then walked away , not reaching the final question for $ 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . 
 On the syndicated version 's first season , two contestants correctly answered all 15 questions and won the top prize of $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 : Kevin Smith on February 18 , 2003 , and Nancy Christy on May 8 of the same year . During the Million Dollar Tournament of Ten which aired in November 2009 , Sam Murray , who had previously supplied correct responses for eleven questions , risked his winnings on a special $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 question ; he was the only contestant to answer his question correctly .

 = = = Hosts = = = 
 The original network version of the U.S. Millionaire and the subsequent primetime specials were hosted by Regis Philbin . When the syndicated version was being developed , the production team felt that it was not feasible for Philbin to continue hosting , as the show recorded four episodes in a single day , and that the team was looking for qualities in a new host : it had to be somebody who would love the contestants and be willing to root for them . Rosie O 'Donnell was initially offered a hosting position on this new edition , but declined the opportunity almost immediately . Eventually Meredith Vieira , who had previously competed in a celebrity charity event on the original network version , was named host of the new syndicated edition . 
 ABC originally offered Vieira hosting duties on the syndicated Millionaire to sweeten one of her re @-@ negotiations for the network 's daytime talk show The View , which she was moderating at the time . When the show was honored by GSN on its Gameshow Hall of Fame special , Vieira herself further explained her motivation for hosting the syndicated version as follows : 
 I did the show because I fell in love with the show , and really , first and foremost , as a parent , [ I feel that ] there aren 't that many shows on television that you can watch as a family . And when Michael Davies approached me and said , " Would you be interested in hosting the syndicated version ? " , I said , " Just point me toward the contract ! I am so there ! " 
 From 2007 to 2011 , when Vieira was concurrently working as a co @-@ host of Today , guest hosts appeared in the second half of each season of the syndicated version . Guest hosts who filled in for Vieira included Philbin , Al Roker , Tom Bergeron , Tim Vincent , Dave Price , Billy Bush , Leeza Gibbons , Cat Deeley , Samantha Harris , Shaun Robinson , Steve Harvey , John Henson , Sherri Shepherd , Tim Gunn , and D. L. <unk> . 
 On January 10 , 2013 , Vieira announced that after eleven seasons with the syndicated Millionaire , she would be leaving the show as part of an effort to focus on other projects in her career . She finalized taping of her last episodes with the show in November 2012 . Her successor as host of the syndicated Millionaire , Cedric the Entertainer , was introduced to the show when season twelve premiered on September 2 , 2013 . On April 30 , 2014 , Deadline announced that Cedric had decided to leave the show in order to lighten his workload , resulting in him being succeeded by Terry Crews for the 2014 – 2015 season . Crews was succeeded by Chris Harrison , host of The Bachelor and its spin @-@ offs , when season 14 premiered on September 14 , 2015 . 
 = = = Production staff = = = 
 The original executive producers of the U.S. Millionaire were British television producers Michael Davies and Paul Smith , the latter of whom undertook the responsibility of licensing Millionaire to American airwaves as part of his effort to transform the UK program into a global franchise . Smith served until 2007 and Davies until 2010 ; additionally , Leigh Hampton ( previously co @-@ executive producer in the later days of the network version and in the syndicated version 's first two seasons ) served as an executive producer from 2004 to 2010 . Rich Sirop , who was previously a supervising producer , became the executive producer in 2010 and held that position until 2014 , when he left Millionaire to hold the same position with Vieira 's newly launched syndicated talk show , and was replaced by James Rowley . Vincent Rubino , who had previously been the syndicated Millionaire 's supervising producer for its first two seasons , served as that version 's co @-@ executive producer for the 2004 – 05 season , after which he was succeeded by Vieira herself , who continued to hold the title until her departure in 2013 ( sharing her position with Sirop for the 2009 – 10 season ) . 
 Producers of the network version included Hampton , Rubino , Leslie Fuller , Nikki Webber , and Terrence McDonnell . For its first two seasons the syndicated version had Deirdre <unk> for its managing producer , then Dennis F. McMahon became producer for the next two seasons ( joined by Dominique <unk> as his line producer ) , after which Jennifer Weeks produced the next four seasons of syndicated Millionaire shows , initially accompanied by Amanda Zucker as her line producer , but later joined for the 2008 – 09 season by Tommy Cody ( who became sole producer in the 2009 – 10 season ) . The first 65 shuffle format episodes were produced by <unk> Smith , and as of 2011 , the title of producer is held by Bryan Lasseter . The network version had Ann Miller and Tiffany Trigg for its supervising producers ; they were joined by Wendy Roth in the first two seasons , and by Michael <unk> in the third and final season . After Rubino 's promotion to co @-@ executive producer , the syndicated version 's later supervising producers included Sirop ( 2004 – 09 ) , Geena <unk> ( 2009 – 10 ) , Brent Burnette ( 2010 – 12 ) , Geoff Rosen ( 2012 – 14 ) , and Liz Harris ( 2014 – 16 ) . 
 The original network version of Millionaire was directed by Mark Gentile , who later served as the syndicated version 's consulting producer for its first two seasons , and then as the director of Duel , which ran on ABC from December 2007 to July 2008 . The syndicated version was directed by Matthew Cohen from 2002 to 2010 , by Rob George from 2010 to 2013 , and by Brian <unk> in the 2013 – 14 season . Former Price Is Right director Rich <unk> became Millionaire 's director in 2014 . 
 = = Production = = 
 The U.S. version of Millionaire is a co @-@ production of <unk> , a division of Sony Pictures Entertainment , and Valleycrest Productions , a division of The Walt Disney Company . <unk> purchased Millionaire 's original production company Celador in 2008 , while Valleycrest has produced the series since its beginning , and holds the copyright on all U.S. Millionaire episodes to date . The show is distributed by Valleycrest 's corporate sibling Disney – ABC Domestic Television ( previously known as Buena Vista Television ) . 
 The U.S. Millionaire was taped at ABC 's Television Center East studio on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York from 1999 to 2012 . <unk> were moved to NEP Broadcasting 's Metropolis Studios in East Harlem in 2013 , and production moved to studios located in Stamford , Connecticut the following year . Episodes of the syndicated version are produced from June to December . The show originally taped four episodes in a single day , but that number has since been changed to five . 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 When the U.S. version of Millionaire was first conceived in 1998 , Michael Davies was a young television producer who was serving as the head of ABC 's little @-@ noticed reality programming division ( at a time when reality television had not yet become a phenomenon in America ) . At that time , ABC was lingering in third place in the ratings indexes among U.S. broadcast networks , and was on the verge of losing its status as one of the " Big Three " networks . Meanwhile , the popularity of game shows was at an all @-@ time nadir , as with the exception of The Price Is Right , the genre was absent from networks ' daytime lineups at that point . Having earlier created Debt for Lifetime Television and participated with Al Burton and Donnie Brainard in the creation of Win Ben Stein 's Money for Comedy Central , Davies decided to create a primetime game show that would save the network from collapse and revive interest in game shows . 
 Davies originally considered reviving CBS 's long @-@ lost quiz show The $ 64 @,@ 000 Question for a new era , with a new home on ABC . However , this effort 's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British Millionaire was about to make its debut , he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show , and subsequently ended up receiving about eight FedEx packages from different family members , each containing a copy of Millionaire 's first episode . Davies was so captivated by everything that he had seen and heard , from host Chris Tarrant 's intimate involvement with the contestant to the show 's lighting system and music tracks , that he chose to abandon his work on the $ 64 @,@ 000 Question revival in favor of introducing Millionaire to American airwaves , convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular . 
 When Davies presented his ideas for the U.S. Millionaire to ABC , the network 's executives initially rejected them , so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer . Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition , Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on Millionaire 's production , and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show . Along with Philbin , a number of other popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. Millionaire during its development , including Peter Jennings , Bob Costas , Phil Donahue , and Montel Williams , but among those considered , it was Philbin who wanted the job the most , and when he saw an episode of the British Millionaire and was blown away by his content , Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show . When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin , the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. Millionaire . With production now ready to begin , the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched , with Davies demanding perfection in every element of Millionaire 's production . 
 = = = Audition process = = = 
 With few exceptions , any legal resident of the United States who is 18 years of age or older has the potential of becoming a contestant through Millionaire 's audition process . Those ineligible include employees , immediate family or household members , and close acquaintances of SPE , Disney , or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries ; television stations that broadcast the syndicated version ; or any advertising agency or other firm or entity engaged in the production , administration , or judging of the show . Also ineligible are current candidates for political office and individuals who have appeared on a different game show outside of cable that has been broadcast within the past year , is intended to be broadcast within the next year , or played the main game on any of the U.S. versions of Millionaire itself . 
 Potential contestants of the original primetime version had to compete in a telephone contest which had them dial a toll @-@ free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order . <unk> had ten seconds to enter the order on a keypad , with any incorrect answer ending the game / call . The 10 @,@ 000 to 20 @,@ 000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method . Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare ( or other transportation ) and hotel accommodations . 
 The syndicated version 's potential contestants , depending on tryouts , are required to pass an electronically scored test comprising a set of thirty questions which must be answered within a 10 @-@ minute time limit . Contestants who fail the test are eliminated , while those who pass are interviewed for an audition by the production staff , and those who impress the staff the most are then notified by postal mail that they have been placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants . At the producers ' discretion , contestants from said pool are selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program ; these contestants are given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they meet all eligibility requirements . Afterwards , they are given a date to travel to the show 's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show . Unlike its ABC counterpart , the syndicated version does not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company 's expense ; that version 's contestants are instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own . 
 The syndicated Millionaire also conducts open casting calls in various locations across the United States to search for potential contestants . These are held in late spring or early summer , with all dates and locations posted on the show 's official website . The producers make no guarantee on how many applicants will be tested at each particular venue ; however , the show will not test any more than 2 @,@ 500 individuals per audition day . 
 In cases when the show features themed episodes with two people playing as a team , auditions for these episodes ' contestants are announced on the show 's website . Both members of the team must pass the written test and the audition interview successfully in order to be considered for selection . If only one member of the team passes , he or she is placed into the contestant pool alone and must continue the audition process as an individual in order to proceed . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Originally , the U.S. Millionaire carried over the musical score from the British version , composed by father @-@ and @-@ son duo Keith and Matthew Strachan . Unlike older game show musical scores , Millionaire 's musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show . The <unk> ' main Millionaire theme song took some inspiration from the " Mars " movement of Gustav Holst 's The Planets , and their question cues from the $ 2 @,@ 000 to the $ 32 @,@ 000 / $ 25 @,@ 000 level , and then from the $ 64 @,@ 000 / $ 50 @,@ 000 level onwards , took the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question , in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game . On GSN 's Gameshow Hall of Fame special , the narrator described the Strachan tracks as " mimicking the sound of a beating heart , " and stated that as the contestant worked their way up the money ladder , the music was " perfectly in tune with their ever @-@ increasing pulse . " 
 The original Millionaire musical score holds the distinction of being the only game show soundtrack to be acknowledged by the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers , as the <unk> were honored with numerous ASCAP awards for their work , the earliest of them awarded in 2000 . The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the clock format in 2008 ; for example , the question cues were synced to the " ticking " sounds of the game clock . Even later , the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the shuffle format in 2010 , in favor of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff <unk> and Mark T. Williams , co @-@ founders of the Los Angeles @-@ based company <unk> Music . 
 = = = Set = = = 
 The U.S. Millionaire 's basic set is a direct adaptation of the British version 's set design , which was conceived by Andy Walmsley . Paul Smith 's original licensing agreement for the U.S. Millionaire required that the show 's set design , along with all other elements of the show 's on @-@ air presentation ( musical score , lighting system , host 's wardrobe , etc . ) , adhere faithfully to the way in which they were presented in the British version ; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show , making Walmsley 's Millionaire set design the most reproduced scenic design in television history . The original version of the U.S. Millionaire 's set cost $ 200 @,@ 000 to construct . The U.S. Millionaire 's production design is handled by George Allison , whose predecessors have included David Weller and Jim Fenhagen . 
 Unlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant ( s ) feel at ease , Millionaire 's set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable , so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show . The floor is made of Plexiglas beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper . Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010 , the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs in the center of the stage , known as " Hot Seats " ; these measured 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) high , were modeled after chairs typically found in hair salons , and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information . Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to Millionaire , Vieira stated in an interview with her Millionaire predecessor on his morning talk show that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat , which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous , actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer . 
 The lighting system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses further into the game . There are also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question ; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights , oil is vaporized , creating a haze effect . Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson , a professor at Syracuse University , stated that the show 's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress . 
 When the shuffle format was introduced , the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium , and as a result , the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able to walk around the stage . Also , two video screens were installed – one that displays the current question in play , and another that displays the contestant 's cumulative total and progress during the game . In September 2012 , the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel , in order to take into account the show 's transition to high @-@ definition broadcasting , which had just come about the previous year . The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones , having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had ; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one ; and light @-@ emitting diode ( LED ) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel .

 The U.S. version of Millionaire was launched by ABC as a half @-@ hour primetime program on August 16 , 1999 . When it premiered , it became the first U.S. network game show to offer a million @-@ dollar top prize to contestants . After airing thirteen episodes and reaching an audience of 15 million viewers by the end of the show 's first week on the air , the program expanded to an hour @-@ long format when it returned in November . The series , of which episodes were originally shown only a day after their initial taping , was promoted to regular status on January 18 , 2000 and , at the height of its popularity , was airing on ABC five nights a week . The show was so popular during its original primetime run that rival networks created or re @-@ incarnated game shows of their own ( e.g. , Greed , Twenty One , etc . ) , as well as importing various game shows of British and Australian origin to America ( such as Winning Lines , Weakest Link , and It 's Your Chance of a Lifetime ) . 
 The nighttime version initially drew in up to 30 million viewers a day three times a week , an unheard @-@ of number in modern network television . In the 1999 – 2000 season , it averaged # 1 in the ratings against all other television shows , with 28 @,@ 848 @,@ 000 viewers . In the next season ( 2000 – 01 ) , three nights out of the five weekly episodes placed in the top 10 . However , the show 's ratings began to fall during the 2000 – 01 season , so that at the start of the 2001 – 02 season , the ratings were only a fraction of what they had been one year before , and by season 's end , the show was no longer even ranked among the top 20 . ABC 's reliance on the show 's popularity led the network to fall quickly from its former spot as the nation 's most watched network . 
 As ABC 's overexposure of the primetime Millionaire led the public to tire of the show , there was speculation that the show would not survive beyond the 2001 – 02 season . The staff planned on switching it to a format that would emphasize comedy more than the game and feature a host other than Philbin , but in the end , the primetime show was canceled , with its final episode airing on June 27 , 2002 . 
 = = = Syndication = = = 
 In 2001 , Millionaire producers began work on a half @-@ hour daily syndicated version of the show , with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network series which was still in production . ABC 's cancellation of the network Millionaire ended that idea ; however , the syndicated Millionaire still had enough interest to be greenlit and BVT sold the series to local stations for the 2002 – 03 season . The syndicated series nearly met the same fate as its predecessor , however , due in part to worries that stemmed from a decision made by one of its affiliates . 
 In the New York media market , BVT sold the syndicated Millionaire to CBS 's flagship station , WCBS @-@ TV . In the season that had passed , WCBS ' mid @-@ afternoon schedule included the syndicated edition of NBC 's Weakest Link , which aired at 4 pm from its January 2002 premiere . Joining Millionaire as a new syndicated series was a spinoff of The Oprah Winfrey Show hosted by Dr. Phil McGraw . WCBS picked up both series for 2002 – 03 , with Dr. Phil serving as lead @-@ in for the syndicated Millionaire , which was plugged into the time slot that Weakest Link had been occupying . 
 At mid @-@ season , WCBS announced that for the 2003 – 04 season it had acquired the broadcast rights to The People 's Court after WNBC , which had been airing the revived series since its 1997 debut , dropped it from its lineup . WCBS announced plans to move The People 's Court into the time slot that was occupied by Millionaire and the still @-@ airing 4 : 30 pm local newscast once it joined the station 's lineup in September 2003 . This led to speculation that the syndicated Millionaire would not be returning for a second season , and BVT 's concerns over losing its New York affiliate were compounded by the fact that there were not many time slots available for the show in New York outside of the undesirable late @-@ night slots that <unk> try to avoid . 
 In June 2003 , a shakeup at one of BVT 's corporate siblings provided the series with an opening . ABC announced that it would be returning the 12 : 30 pm network time slot to its affiliates in October of that year following the cancellation of the soap opera Port Charles . ABC 's flagship , WABC @-@ TV , was thus in need of a program to fill the slot and BVT went to them asking if the station would pick up Millionaire . WABC agreed to do this and when the new season launched that fall , the station began airing Millionaire at 12 : 30 pm . Millionaire continued to air on WABC in the afternoon until the end of the 2014 – 15 season , when it acquired the broadcast rights to <unk> for the 2015 – 16 season . To make room for <unk> , the afternoon airing of Millionaire was moved to independent station <unk> @-@ TV . 
 According to e @-@ mails released in the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack , Millionaire narrowly avoided cancellation after the 2014 – 15 season . The show 's declining ratings prompted DADT to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal , which SPE was hesitant to accept . The series was nonetheless renewed for the 2015 – 16 season , with various cuts to the show 's production budget and a return to the original format ( but with only 14 questions ) . Had the show not been renewed , SPE would have placed the show on extended hiatus for three years , reclaimed full rights to the show ( without the innovations and format added in the syndicated run , to which DADT owns intellectual property rights ) , and shopped the revived show to another network or syndicator . 
 = = = GSN = = = 
 GSN acquired the rerun rights to the U.S. Millionaire in August 2003 . The network initially aired only episodes from the three seasons of the original prime @-@ time run ; however , additional episodes were later added . These included the Super Millionaire spin @-@ off , which aired on GSN from May 2005 to January 2007 , and the first two seasons of the syndicated version , which began airing on November 10 , 2008 . 
 = = Special editions = = 
 Various special editions and tournaments have been conducted which feature celebrities playing the game and donating winnings to charities of their choice . During celebrity editions on the original ABC version , contestants were allowed to receive help from their fellow contestants during the first ten questions . The most successful celebrity contestants throughout the show 's run have included Drew Carey , Rosie O 'Donnell , Norm MacDonald , and Chip Esten , all of whom won $ 500 @,@ 000 for their respective charities . The episode featuring O 'Donnell 's $ 500 @,@ 000 win averaged 36 @.@ 1 million viewers , the highest number for a single episode of the show . 
 There have also been special weeks featuring two or three family members or couples competing as a team , a " Champions Edition " where former big winners returned and split their winnings with their favorite charities , a " Zero Dollar Winner Edition " featuring contestants who previously missed one of the first @-@ tier questions and left with nothing , and a " Tax @-@ Free Edition " in which H & R Block calculated the taxes of winnings to allow contestants to earn stated winnings after taxes , and various theme weeks featuring college students , teachers , brides @-@ to @-@ be , etc. as contestants . Additionally , the syndicated version once featured an annual " Walk In & Win Week " with contestants who were randomly selected from the audience without having to take the audition test . 
 Special weeks have also included shows featuring questions concerning specific topics , such as professional football , celebrity gossip , movies , and pop culture . During a week of episodes in November 2007 , to celebrate the 1,000th episode of the syndicated Millionaire , all contestants that week started with $ 1 @,@ 000 so that they could not leave empty @-@ handed , and only had to answer ten questions to win $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . During that week , twenty home viewers per day also won $ 1 @,@ 000 each . 
 = = = Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire = = = 
 In 2004 , Philbin returned to host 12 episodes of a spin @-@ off program titled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire in which contestants could potentially win $ 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . ABC aired five episodes of this spin @-@ off during the week of February 22 , 2004 , and an additional seven episodes later that year in May . As usual , the contestants were to answer a series of 15 multiple choice questions of increasing difficulty , but the dollar values were substantially increased . The payout structure of Super Millionaire was as follows : first going from $ 1 @,@ 000 to $ 5 @,@ 000 in increments of $ 1 @,@ 000 ; then from $ 10 @,@ 000 to $ 30 @,@ 000 in increments of $ 10 @,@ 000 ; then to $ 50 @,@ 000 , $ 100 @,@ 000 , $ 500 @,@ 000 , and $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ; and finally from $ 2 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 to $ 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 with the dollar value doubling for each new question . 
 Contestants were given the standard three lifelines in place at the time ( 50 : 50 , Ask the Audience , and Phone @-@ a @-@ Friend ) at the beginning of the game . However , after correctly answering the $ 100 @,@ 000 question , the contestant earned two additional lifelines : Three Wise Men and Double Dip . The Three Wise Men lifeline involved a panel of three experts , one of whom was always a former Millionaire contestant and at least one of whom was female . When this lifeline was used , the contestant and panel had 30 seconds to discuss the question and choices before the audio and video feeds were dropped . If the contestant decides to use Double Dip , the contestant is then forbidden from walking away from the question and is given two chances to answer the given question and if both answers are wrong , the contestant drops to $ 100 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = 10th Anniversary Celebration = = = 
 To celebrate the tenth anniversary of Millionaire 's U.S. debut , the show returned to ABC primetime for an eleven @-@ night event hosted by Philbin , which aired August 9 – 23 , 2009 . The Academy Award @-@ winning movie Slumdog Millionaire and the 2008 economic crisis helped boost interest of renewal of the game show . 
 The episodes featured game play based on the previous rule set of the syndicated version ( including the rule changes implemented in season seven ) but used the Fastest Finger round to select contestants . Various celebrities also made special guest appearances at the end of every episode ; each guest played one question for a chance at $ 50 @,@ 000 for a charity of their choice , being allowed to use any one of the four lifelines in place at the time ( Phone @-@ a @-@ Friend , Ask the Audience , Double Dip , and Ask the Expert ) , but still earned a minimum of $ 25 @,@ 000 for the charity if they answered the question incorrectly . 
 The finale of the tenth anniversary special , which aired on August 23 , 2009 , featured Ken Basin , an entertainment lawyer , Harvard Law graduate , and former Jeopardy ! contestant , who went on to become the first contestant to play a $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 question in the " clock format " era . With a time of 4 : 39 ( 45 seconds + 3 : 54 banked time ) , Basin was given a question involving President Lyndon Baines Johnson 's fondness for Fresca . Using his one remaining lifeline , Basin asked the audience , which supported his own hunch of Yoo @-@ hoo rather than the correct answer . He decided to answer the question and lost $ 475 @,@ 000 , becoming the first contestant in the U.S. version to answer a $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 question incorrectly . After Basin finished his run , Vieira appeared on @-@ camera and announced that all remaining Fastest Finger contestants would play with her on the first week of the syndicated version 's eighth season . After this , the million dollar question was not played again on a standard episode until September 25 , 2013 , when <unk> Reaves became the second U.S. Millionaire contestant to incorrectly answer her $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 question . 
 = = = Million Dollar Tournament of Ten = = = 
 Although the syndicated Millionaire had produced two millionaires in its first season , Nancy Christy 's May 2003 win was still standing as the most recent when the program began its eighth season in fall of 2009 . Deciding that six @-@ plus years had been too long since someone had won the top prize , producers conducted a tournament to find a third million dollar winner . For the first nine weeks of the 2009 – 10 season , each episode saw contestants attempt to qualify for what was referred to as the " Tournament of Ten " . Contestants were seeded based on how much money they had won , with the biggest winner ranked first and the lowest ranked tenth . Ties were broken based on how much time a contestant had banked when they had walked away from the game . 
 The tournament began on the episode aired November 9 , 2009 , and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed , tournament contestants played one at a time at the end of that episode and the next nine . The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar question under the clock format introduced the season before , except here , the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal . Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds . For each question they had answered before walking away , the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers . The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit . 
 Each contestant had the same decision facing them as before , which was whether to attempt to answer the question or walk away with their pre @-@ tournament total intact . Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play , with a reduction of their pre @-@ tournament winnings to $ 25 @,@ 000 . If the question was answered correctly , the player that did so became the tournament leader . If another player after him / her answered correctly , that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre @-@ tournament winnings . The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question at the end of the tournament on November 20 , 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series ' third millionaire . 
 The first contestant to attempt to answer the million dollar question was Sam Murray , the tournament 's eighth @-@ seeded qualifier . On November 11 , Murray was asked approximately how many people had lived on Earth in its history and correctly guessed 100 billion . Murray was still atop the leaderboard entering the November 20 finale as he remained the only contestant to even attempt to answer his or her question . The only person who could defeat him was top seed and $ 250 @,@ 000 winner Jehan <unk> @-@ Deen , who was asked a question regarding the <unk> , cited as " a rare example of a word that rhymes with orange " . <unk> @-@ Deen considered taking the risk , believing ( correctly ) that the name belonged to a mountain in Wales . However , she decided that the potential of losing $ 225 @,@ 000 did not justify the risk and elected to walk away from the question , giving Murray the win and the million dollar prize .

 Since its introduction to the United States , Who Wants to Be a Millionaire has been credited with not only single @-@ handedly reviving the game show genre , but also breaking new ground for it . The series revolutionized the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system , dramatic music cues , and futuristic set . The show also became one of the highest @-@ rated and most popular game shows in U.S. television history , and has been credited with paving the way for the rise of the reality TV phenomenon to prominence throughout the 2000s . 
 The U.S. Millionaire also made catchphrases out of various lines used on the show . In particular , " Is that your final answer ? " , asked by Millionaire 's hosts whenever a contestant 's answer needs to be verified , was popularized by Philbin during his tenure as host , and was also included on TV Land 's special " 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catch Phrases " , which aired in 2006 . Meanwhile , during his tenure as host , Cedric signed off shows with a catchphrase of his own , " Watch yo ' wallet ! " 
 The original primetime version of the U.S. Millionaire won two Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game / Audience Participation Show in 2000 and 2001 . Philbin was honored with a Daytime Emmy in the category of Outstanding Game Show Host in 2001 , while Vieira received one in 2005 , and another in 2009 . TV Guide ranked the U.S. Millionaire # 7 on its 2001 list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time , and later ranked it # 6 on its 2013 " 60 Greatest Game Shows " list . GSN ranked Millionaire # 5 on its August 2006 list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time , and later honored the show in January 2007 on its only Gameshow Hall of Fame special .

 In 2000 , Pressman released two board game adaptions of Millionaire as well as a junior edition recommended for younger players . Several video games based on the varying gameplay formats of Millionaire have also been released throughout the course of the show 's U.S. history . 
 Between 1999 and 2001 , Jellyvision produced five video game adaptations based upon the original primetime series for personal computers and Sony 's PlayStation console , all of them featuring Philbin 's likeness and voice . The first of these adaptations was published by Disney Interactive , while the later four were published by Buena Vista Interactive which had just been spun off from DI when it reestablished itself in attempts to diversify its portfolio . Of the five games , three featured general trivia questions , one was sports @-@ themed , and another was a " Kids Edition " featuring easier questions . In 2008 , Imagination Games released a DVD version of the show , based on the 2004 – 08 format and coming complete with Vieira 's likeness and voice , as well as a quiz book and a 2009 desktop calendar . Additionally , two Millionaire video games were released by <unk> in conjunction with Ubisoft in 2010 and 2011 ; the first of these was a game for Nintendo 's Wii console and DS handheld system based on the 2008 – 10 clock format , while the second , for Microsoft 's Xbox 360 , was based on the current shuffle format . 
 <unk> has also created a Facebook game based on Millionaire , which debuted on March 21 , 2011 . This game features an altered version of the shuffle format , condensing the number of questions to twelve — eight in round one , and four in round two . A contestant can compete against eight other Millionaire fans in round one , and play round two alone if they make it into the top three . There is no " final answer " rule ; the contestant 's responses are automatically locked in . Answering a question correctly earns a contestant the value of that question , multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly . Contestants are allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as Jump the Question lifelines in round one , and to use the Ask the Audience lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question .

 Who Wants to Be a Millionaire – Play It ! was an attraction at the Disney 's Hollywood Studios theme park ( when it was known as Disney @-@ MGM Studios ) at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando , Florida and at Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim , California . Both the Florida and California Play It ! attractions opened in 2001 ; the California version closed in 2004 , and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by Toy Story Midway Mania ! 
 The format in the Play It ! attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it . When a show started , a " Fastest Finger " question was given , and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order ; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show . However , the main game had some differences : for example , contestants competed for points rather than dollars , the questions were set to time limits , and the Phone @-@ a @-@ Friend lifeline became Phone a Complete Stranger which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction 's theater who would find a guest to help . After the contestant 's game was over , they were awarded anything from a collectible pin , to clothing , to a Millionaire CD game , to a 3 @-@ night Disney Cruise .

 Sir Bevil Grenville 's Monument is a monument erected in 1720 on Lansdown , then called " Lansdowne Hill " , 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) north @-@ west of the city of Bath , in Somerset , England . It was designated a Grade II * listed building on 1 February 1956 , and a scheduled monument on 12 December 1950 . 
 The monument commemorates the heroism of the Civil War Royalist commander Sir Bevil Grenville ( 1596 @-@ 1643 ) of Stowe , Kilkhampton in Cornwall and Bideford in Devon , who on 5 July 1643 fell mortally wounded at the Battle of Lansdowne , leading his regiment of Cornish pikemen . It was erected by Grenville 's grandson and has been maintained by his descendants . This has included the repair of inscriptions carved on the base of the monument , eulogising Grenville and his forces . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Battle of Lansdowne took place on 5 July 1643 during the Civil War . The Royalists under Lord Hopton attacked the Parliamentarians led by Sir William Waller who occupied a commanding position on Lansdowne Hill . Under the leadership of Sir Bevil Grenville , Hopton 's Cornish pikemen stormed Waller 's breastworks , while Royalist musketeers outflanked Waller by passing through the woods on each side of his position . Grenville was mortally wounded in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat as Parliamentarian horse counter @-@ attacked and were driven off . He received a mortal blow to the head with a <unk> and was taken to the rectory at nearby Cold Ashton where he died . His death was a set @-@ back from which the king 's cause in the Westcountry never recovered , for he alone knew how to handle the unruly Cornishmen . 
 = = History = = 
 The monument was erected in 1720 by George Granville , 1st Baron Lansdowne ( 1666 @-@ 1735 ) , grandson of Sir Bevil and heir male to William Granville , 3rd Earl of Bath ( <unk> ) , great @-@ grandson of Sir Bevil and the last male in the senior line of the family . In 1714 Baron Lansdowne had erected a mural monument to Sir Bevil in the Grenville Chapel in the Church of St James the Great , Kilkhampton , Cornwall , in which parish was situated the Grenville seat of Stowe . 
 The monument has been repaired several times . Initially in 1777 and again in 1828 and then in 1879 , each time the repairs were funded by Granville 's descendants . Note that the original spelling was Bevil Granville but today Grenville or Greville are commonly used . 
 = = Description = = 
 The monument is of ashlar stone masonry , 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) high , in the English Baroque style . On the south side is a slate tablet inscribed with a quotation from the account by Lord Clarendon ( 1609 @-@ 1674 ) in his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England of the Battle of Lansdowne ( 1643 ) . On the north side are two poems . On top is a griffin ( the crest and supporters of the Grenvilles ) holding an escutcheon displaying the Grenville coat of arms : Gules , three clarions or . On another side are shown the Royal Arms of King Charles II ( 1660 @-@ 1685 ) supported by the arms of Sir Bevil 's eldest son and heir John Granville , 1st Earl of Bath ( 1628 – 1701 ) and by the arms of the latter 's half first cousin General George Monck , 1st Duke of Albemarle , KG ( 1608 @-@ 1670 ) . Monck was the principal figure behind the Restoration of the Monarchy to King Charles II in 1660 , in effecting which he was much assisted by Sir John Grenville , for which services both were elevated to the peerage .

 The Elegy on Sir Bevil Grenville by William Cartwright , a fellow Royalist , who died shortly after Sir Bevil on 29 November 1643 , is inscribed on the monument :

 But a diviner fury fierce and high , 
 Valour transported into Ecstasy . 
 = Baby Jesus theft = 
 Baby Jesus theft is the theft of plastic or ceramic figurines of the infant Jesus from outdoor public and private nativity displays during the Christmas season . It is an " enduring ( and illegal ) practice " according to New York Times journalist Katie Rogers , " believed to be part of a yearly tradition , often carried out by bored teenagers looking for an easy prank . " The prevalence of such thefts has caused the owners of outdoor manger scenes to protect their property with GPS devices , surveillance cameras , or by other means . 
 = = Incidents = = 
 Dozens of communities across America have suffered thefts of Baby Jesus figurines , and , in some instances , entire nativity scenes , Washington DC journalist Daniel <unk> reports for Britain 's The Guardian . He observes that it is unclear whether such theft is on the rise , as it is not tracked by federal law enforcement . 
 In 2008 , a Baby Jesus was stolen from First United Methodist Church in Kittanning , Pennsylvania and replaced with a pumpkin , and , in Eureka Springs , Arkansas , a thief not only stole the Baby Jesus from a public display but absconded with the concrete block and chain that was supposed to act as a deterrent . Some communities suffer repeat Baby Jesus thefts . A Baby Jesus was stolen in December 2008 from a Stony Point town display . A town official remarked , " If someone did it as a prank , I don 't find it funny . " The nativity had been vandalized the year before , and a menorah next to it had been toppled and broken . 
 During some Christmases of the first decade of the 21st century , the Baby Jesus statue was often stolen from the outdoor nativity scene in Jönköping in Sweden , once thrown into the nearby lake of Vättern . This has led to the nativity scene , resembling a wooden stable , being closed by nights . 
 Some figurines have been defaced with profanity or Satanic symbols . In December 2008 , for example , a fiberglass Baby Jesus valued at US $ 375 was stolen from a Eureka Springs , Arkansas park and later recovered , but had been defaced by racial slurs , a swastika , and a Hitler mustache . The eyes were also blacked out and pieces had been broken off , rendering it damaged beyond repair . 
 In his autobiography , The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell , Marilyn Manson admitted playing a prank in which he and a few friends stole figurines of Jesus then replaced them with hams . They sent a communique to a newspaper posing as a black radical group saying that it was a protest against " the <unk> of the black man 's wisdom with the so @-@ called ' White Christmas ' . "

 Some nativity display owners have taken measures to secure their property against would @-@ be thieves . Others are reluctant to exercise such vigilance . One Indiana man who suffered the loss of his Baby Jesus figurine rebuffed suggestions to secure the figurines on his porch because , " that would be like putting Jesus in jail " . Traditional security measures are not always foolproof . The Baby Jesus fastened to the National Christmas Creche at Independence Hall disappeared within days . 
 Some communities , churches , and citizens are employing electronic technology to protect their property . A Texas family , for example , positioned surveillance cameras in their yard and discovered a teenage girl stealing their Baby Jesus figurine , valued at nearly US $ 500 . In 2008 , a security device distributor offered its surveillance cameras and GPS devices to 200 non @-@ profit religious institutions for a month 's use gratis . GPS protection has met with some success . In one case , after a life @-@ size ceramic nativity figurine disappeared from the lawn of a community center in Wellington , Florida , sheriff 's deputies tracked it to an apartment where it was found lying face @-@ down on a carpet . An 18 @-@ year @-@ old woman was arrested .

 While Baby Jesus thefts are largely regarded as pranks , they are set apart by the involvement of a religious icon . " They think it 's a prank , but it isn 't a prank to some of these people , " Pennsylvania state police Corporal Paul <unk> told The Morning Call newspaper , in regards to an incident in which ten nativity scene figures were found in a yard after being stolen from across Bucks County , Pennsylvania . " Plus , it 's just wrong to steal the baby Jesus . " 
 Some have wondered if an anti @-@ Christian sentiment lurks behind the thefts . Attorney Mike Johnson of the Alliance Defending Freedom ( formerly the Alliance Defense Fund ) , a Christian legal group , stated , " I suspect most of it is childish pranks . Clearly , there are adults with an agenda to remove Christ from Christmas . But they tend to occupy themselves with the courts and courtroom of public opinion . " Stephen Nissenbaum , the author of The Battle for Christmas and a retired professor , views Baby Jesus theft as neither innocent vandalism nor religious hate crimes . Nissenbaum writes that , " What it means is that it 's OK to go around violating even pretty important norms , as long as real human harm isn 't being done . It 's not exactly devaluing Christianity , but it is sort of a ritualized challenge to it . It could be Christian kids doing it — and on January 2 they become good Christians again . " 
 Historian Daniel Silliman has argued that , whatever the thieves ' intention , the act puts the culture of Christmas in a different light . " Baby Jesus thieves literally take the Christ out of Christmas , " Silliman writes . " When they do , it becomes apparent that the sacred object is also a piece of property , protected by the law that protects property and this whole apparatus that defends Christmas : fences and lights , tracking devices and private security companies , patrolling police and the courts . The commercialization of Christmas is visible here in a way it might not be , otherwise . That ’ s the power of the joke . "

 Stocksbridge Park Steels Football Club is an English association football club based in Stocksbridge , South Yorkshire . They play in Division One South of the Northern Premier League at level eight of the English football league system . The club was formed in 1986 after a merger between two other clubs , and sports a yellow and blue home kit . They play at the Bracken Moor ground . 
 They initially played in the Northern Counties East League and progressed through the <unk> 's divisions before winning promotion to Division One of the Northern Premier League ( NPL ) in 1996 . They reached the Premier Division of the NPL in 2009 , but were relegated back to Division One South in 2014 . 
 Steels have participated in the FA Cup every year since 1992 , reaching the 4th qualifying round in 2003 , and first entered the FA Trophy in 1996 after previously participating in the FA Vase . 
 = = History = = 
 Stocksbridge Park Steels F.C. was formed in 1986 as the result of the merger of Stocksbridge Works , the works team of the local British Steel Corporation plant , with another local club , Oxley Park Sports . The new club was immediately admitted to the Northern Counties East League Division Two , the works club having previously played in Division Three of the same league . 
 The Steels spent five seasons in Division Two before being placed in Division One when the lower division was discontinued upon league re @-@ organisation in 1991 . In the same year Mick Horne was appointed as the club 's manager , and he led the team to the championship of Division One in the 1991 – 92 season . 
 In Stocksbridge 's first season in the Premier Division the team finished near the bottom of the table , but in the 1993 – 94 season the Steels became Northern Counties East League champions . The club failed to gain promotion to the Northern Premier League , however , as their stadium did not meet the required standard . The club finished second in the division two seasons later , losing the championship on goal difference to Hatfield Main , and on this occasion were admitted to the Northern Premier League Division One . 
 Stocksbridge finished in the top half of the table in the club 's first five seasons at the higher level , with a best finish of fourth place in the 2000 – 01 season , but the following season the Steels finished only two places from the bottom of the league . Shortly before the end of this season , manager Mick Horne tendered his resignation after 11 years in charge and was replaced by his assistant , former Norwich City player Wayne Biggins . 
 Under Biggins ' management , the Steels had their best ever runs in both the FA Cup and FA Trophy and set a club record with a 17 – 1 defeat of Oldham Town in the FA Cup preliminary round in August 2002 , but remained near the bottom of the league table . After the Steels were defeated 6 – 0 by Shildon in the final qualifying round of the 2003 – 04 FA Cup , Biggins attempted to resign but the board of directors persuaded him to continue in his job . However , he left in November 2003 , with the club again fighting a battle against relegation . 
 Former assistant manager of local rivals Worksop Town Peter <unk> was appointed as Stocksbridge 's new manager , and in the 2005 – 06 season he led the team to a sixth @-@ place finish , sufficient to qualify for the play @-@ offs for promotion to the Northern Premier League Premier Division . After holding Kendal Town to a 1 – 1 draw in the semi @-@ final , the Steels lost a penalty shoot @-@ out , ending their hopes of promotion . 
 The following season Stocksbridge again finished in sixth place , although with only two teams promoted , it was not high enough to qualify for the play @-@ offs . Stocksbridge did , however , defeat Worksop Town to win the Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup . Following this win manager <unk> resigned in order to return to his former club , Worksop , as manager , with Gary Marrow replacing him for the 2007 – 08 season , for which the club was placed in the Southern section of the now @-@ regionalised Division One . Stocksbridge again qualified for the play @-@ offs , but lost to Sheffield . In the 2008 – 09 season , the Steels again qualified for the play @-@ offs and defeated Belper Town in the final to gain promotion to the Northern Premier League Premier Division for the first time . During the following season , Marrow resigned as manager and was replaced by Simon Collins . The Steels spent five years in the Premier Division , never finishing out of the bottom half of the table , and were relegated at the end of the 2013 – 14 season .

 The Steels have generally worn a kit of yellow shirts with varying amounts of blue trim , blue shorts , and yellow stockings during their short history . The club badge is predominantly yellow and blue to reflect this , and features a representation of a clock tower located on Nanny Hill , near the club 's stadium . Two footballs displaying the year of the club 's formation were added on the occasion of the club 's twentieth anniversary in 2006 . The club is unusual in having an alternate crest for its away shirts with the colours reversed . The team 's nickname is " Steels " or " The Steels " .

 The Steels have always played their games at Bracken Moor , the former home of Stocksbridge Works . In 2006 it was announced that the stadium was to be sponsored by local newspaper Look Local for a term of five years , resulting in its official name being changed to the Look Local Stadium , a deal which was later extended to 2013 . The stadium has a maximum capacity of 3 @,@ 500 , with 450 seats . 
 The ground was a cricket pitch until shortly after the Second World War , when it was purchased by a local steelmaking company and converted into a football stadium . Stone @-@ built changing rooms were erected in the mid @-@ 1960s , replacing a small hut , as was a seated stand and terracing . The main stand has a distinctive angled awning which extends from the fascia and seats which came from Sheffield Wednesday 's Hillsborough Stadium . Floodlights were installed at the stadium in 1990 and the terracing partially covered four years later . 
 As one side of the ground directly adjoins a cricket pitch , the club was required to erect a dividing fence in order to gain entry to the Northern Premier League . The fence is temporary in nature and is removed during the cricket season . It was partially funded by money raised from friendlies against Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United . 
 = = Supporters = = 
 The average attendance at the Look Local Stadium was 180 in the 2008 – 09 season , the ninth highest of twenty teams in the Northern Premier League Division One South , with the largest attendance being 451 for the visit of Sheffield .

 The club 's best performance in the FA Cup was an appearance in the fourth and final qualifying round in the 2003 – 04 season . After winning four matches to progress from the preliminary round , the Steels lost 6 – 0 away to Shildon . In the same season the club achieved its best performance in the FA Trophy , reaching the second round proper only to lose 4 – 2 away to Blyth Spartans . 
 The club 's record victory was a 17 – 1 win over Oldham Town in the FA Cup in 2002 .

 = Happy Working Song = 
 " Happy Working Song " is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz for Walt Disney Pictures ' musical film Enchanted ( 2007 ) . Recorded by American actress Amy Adams in her starring role as Giselle , the uptempo pop song both parodies and pays homage to a variety of songs from several Disney animated feature films , particularly " Whistle While You Work " from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) . Produced by Menken , Schwartz and Danny Troob , the song appears on the film 's soundtrack Enchanted : Original Soundtrack . 
 " Happy Working Song " takes place in Robert 's untidy apartment in Manhattan , New York , in which Giselle spends her first night in the city after having been magically transported there from the fictional Andalasia . The next morning , Giselle awakens to find the apartment in a state of neglect and decides to clean it , summoning several animals to her aid . Additionally , the musical number references similar scenes from Disney 's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella ( 1950 ) . Based on 1950s music , " Happy Working Song " ' s bridge deliberately references the song " Belle " from Disney 's Beauty and the Beast ( 1991 ) . 
 Musically , " Happy Working Song " shares similarities with the songs " Heigh @-@ Ho " from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , " The Work Song " from Cinderella and " Something There " from Beauty and the Beast . The song has garnered vastly positive reviews , with both film and music critics praising its humorous , witty lyrics , allusions and references to previous Disney films and songs , as well as Adams ' performance . " Happy Working Song " was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 80th Academy Awards in 2008 alongside Enchanted 's own " That 's How You Know " and " So Close " , making the film one of only four to achieve this feat . Ultimately , the song lost to " Falling Slowly " from Once ( 2007 ) , while the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences subsequently decided to limit the total number of Best Original Song nominations to only two per film .

 Veteran Disney composer Alan Menken became actively creatively involved with Enchanted in 2006 , subsequently inviting his longtime collaborator , lyricist Stephen Schwartz , with whom Menken had previously worked on Disney 's Pocahontas ( 1995 ) and The Hunchback of Notre Dame ( 1996 ) , to co @-@ write the songs and musical numbers for Enchanted alongside him . Menken said of the general songwriting process , " the first challenge for us was finding that musical palette and lyrical palette and performance palette that really spoke to everybody and said that we are in the world of early Walt and to have that place to start . " 
 When it came to writing " Happy Working Song " , Menken and Schwartz were directly influenced by the song " Whistle While You Work " from Disney 's first full @-@ length animated feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) , with Schwartz describing " Happy Working Song " as a " spoof " and " one of the funniest sequences of the film " . According to Schwartz , " Happy Working Song " was written rather quickly , having come " [ to the songwriters ] really fast " . Schwartz elaborated , " ' Happy Working Song ' is ... pretty much out of Snow White and ' Whistle While You Work ' and that little thing where they do the dishes and Dopey with the soap bubbles and everything . " In addition to this , " Happy Working Song " features references to both the musical number " The Work Song " and " the busy little mice " from Disney 's Cinderella ( 1950 ) , but to a significantly lesser extent . Lyrically , Schwartz decided to approach the song comically as demonstrated by its phrase " Even though you are vermin . " 
 Conceptually , Menken explained that " As the characters become sort of three dimensional , songs become more contemporary . " Ultimately , Menken believes that , melodically , " Happy Working Song " is very much similar to the songs " Belle " and " Something There " from Beauty and the Beast . Additionally , orchestrator and arranger Danny Troob revealed the bridge of " Happy Working Song " is directly based on the bridge of " Belle " , particularly serving as " a deliberate reference on [ the songwriters ' ] part . " Addressing the musical similarities between " Happy Working Song " and " Something There " , Troob explained that the former occupies a different " drive " and " attitude " , additionally sounding " a little bit more brisk ... because [ Giselle is ] working . " Troob elaborated , " Beauty and the Beast was , for its time , very forward @-@ looking , and ' Happy Working Song ' is deliberately retro . " Troob decided to alter and deliberately steer the song away from Menken and Schwartz 's original 1970s @-@ inspired musical arrangement in an attempt to " make it feel like the 1950s " by " manipulating instruments [ sic ] textures . " 
 American actress Amy Adams , who portrays Giselle , had previously " worked in musical theater before [ she ] moved to Los Angeles " in order to pursue a career as a film actress , and was therefore " very comfortable with the idea of singing " . Citing both actress and singer Julie Andrews and several Disney Princesses as musical inspiration , Adams decided to perform the film 's first song , " True Love 's Kiss " , in the style of an operetta before eventually replacing this with a more Broadway musical @-@ style voice for " Happy Working Song " . 
 = = Context , scene and analysis = = 
 Having just recently arrived in New York City after having been magically transported there from her fantastical world of Andalasia , a lost and hopelessly confused Giselle is discovered wandering around by Robert , a single father and divorce attorney , and his daughter Morgan . Robert decides to offer his assistance to Giselle by inviting her to spend a night 's shelter in the safety of their apartment . The following morning , Giselle awakens to find Robert 's apartment in a complete state of disarray . During the " Happy Working Song " musical sequence , described as one of the film 's " large scale production numbers " , Giselle , who is very much appalled by the untidy state of Robert 's Manhattan apartment , decides to " repay ... the favour " by taking the liberty of confronting and cleaning up the apartment 's mess herself . By performing a brief aria and " utilizing her animal @-@ charming abilities " , Giselle musically " summons the city 's animals " in order " to help her tidy it up " . This gesture and scene serves as a reference to similar scenes and musical sequences from preceding Disney animated fairy tale films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( 1937 ) and Cinderella ( 1950 ) . 
 Demonstrating and suggesting " that Giselle really does have some magical power , even in [ the real world ] " , – according to Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer , " When she breaks into song ... sewer rats and cockroaches arrive to help with the housework " – the aria is immediately responded to by several animals , creatures and " vermin " typically associated with New York City , including rats , pigeons , roaches , and flies – visually meant to represent " makeshift ' forest friends ' " – " as opposed to the woodland critters of the movie 's opening animated segment . " According to film critic Brent Simon of Shared Darkness , the comedic gag serves as one of the film 's " amusing ways to contrast the two worlds " of Giselle 's fictional Andalasia and the real @-@ life New York City . 
 Several professional film critics have allotted a variety of different terms and nicknames to the animals who appear during the " Happy Working Song " sequence . Neil Smith of BBC Online described the animals who appear during the scene as " a grotesque menagerie of CG vermin " , while the Orlando Sentinel 's Roger Moore jokingly referred to them as New York 's own " woodland creatures " , writing , " the rats and pigeons are merely the <unk> ones " . Manohla Dargis of The New York Times coined the creatures " urban critters . "

 " Happy Working Song " is a " vibrant " , uptempo pop song . Reminiscent of and influenced by a variety of " archetypal Disney " and " classical @-@ sounding " musical numbers , the musical theater @-@ inspired song runs a total length of two minutes and nine seconds . Incorporating into its lyrical structure a variety of " clever " words including " toilet " , " <unk> " and " vermin " , while rhyming humorous terms such as " hum " and " scum " with " dum dum dum " and " <unk> @-@ um " , " Happy Working Song " ' s use of " comical " , " tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek lyrics " , according to Filmtracks.com , both describe and add narration to Giselle 's " attempts to conjure an ultra happy tune while scrubbing floors and toilets in the real world " upon deciding " to clean her new home with the help of ... cockroaches and flies " . Its musical instrumentation is heavily reliant on the use of the harpsichord , with Filmtracks.com additionally describing " Happy Working Song " as a " harpsichord @-@ laced " song . Troob purposefully included the harpsichord in the song 's instrumentation and orchestration in order to provide it with a more accurate " period setting " . 
 According to Common Sense Media , " Happy Working Song " shares similarities with and is also inspired by " Heigh @-@ Ho " from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , in addition to " Whistle While You Work " from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and " The Work Song " from Cinderella . Additionally , the song is reminiscent of " Belle " and " Something There " from Beauty and the Beast , specifically when it comes to its bridge and " staccato quality " . Written in the key of D major in alla breve cut common time , " Happy Working Song " is structured around a " lilting " , Broadway musical @-@ inspired melody . According to the song 's official sheet music , published at Musicnotes.com by Walt Disney Music Publishing , " Happy Working Song " follows an upbeat , " perky and live " tempo of 88 beats per minute . In portrayal of Giselle , Adams performs the song using an " earnest " , " tart ... soprano voice " . Her high soprano vocal range spans approximately two octaves , from the low note of G # 3 to the high note of D5 . The song 's lyrics begin , " Come , my little friends , as we all sing a happy little working song , merry little voices clear and strong . "

 " Happy Working Song " has garnered widespread critical acclaim .

" Drawing similarities between the song and " Heigh @-@ Ho " , Jacqueline Rupp of Common Sense Media commented , " the ' Hi @-@ Ho ' [ sic ] -inspired ' Happy Working Song ' will have kids giggling and dancing . " Jeff Swindoll of Monsters and Critics wrote that " Happy Working Song " successfully " ap [ es ] ' Whistle While You Work ' most amusingly . " The New York Times ' Manohla Dargis called " Happy Working Song " " brilliantly surrealistic " . 
 Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly described " Happy Working Song " as a " hilarious ... production number " that successfully " encapsulates the joys of Enchanted " . The Wall Street Journal 's Joe Morgenstern enthusiastically praised both the song and the sequence , hailing the latter as " magical " while describing " Happy Working Song " as a " gleeful variation on theme of ' Whistle While You Work ' " . Similarly , Todd McCarthy of Variety called " Happy Working Song " " a hilarious variation on ' Whistle While You Work ' " . Sun Media 's Kevin Williamson hailed the musical number as one of the film 's " stand @-@ outs " , elaborating , " [ ' ] Happy Working Song [ ' is ] a crowd @-@ pleaser . " The Mountain Xpress ' Ken Hanke allotted particular praise to Adams ' , writing that when the actress is " singing her ' Happy Working Song ' with her makeshift ' forest friends ' ... she is the perfect cartoon heroine made flesh " . Kerry Lengel of The Arizona Republic jokingly lauded " Happy Working Song " as " the funniest - and grossest - set piece in the film . " Calling the sequence the " film 's highlight " , Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer commented , " The song , like the movie , is cheerfully gross enough to get boys - and their fathers - into theater seats for a story every tween and her mother will love . " 
 Interestingly , film critics who generally disliked Enchanted tended to have mostly positive things to report about " Happy Working Song " . Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian , who assigned the film a negative score of two out of five stars , in contrast gave " Happy Working Song " a positive review , describing it as " a funny opening song " . Additionally , Bradshaw drew similarities between the musical number and scenes from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Disney 's Mary Poppins ( 1964 ) . 
 One of the song 's few negative reviews was written by Mary F. Pols of the Contra Costa Times , who opined , " a cleaning crew of vermin and cockroaches is just real enough to be crass rather than funny " . 
 Empire ranked " Happy Working Song " third on its list of the " 10 Great Musical Numbers " of the decade , writing that although " Shrek set the benchmark for Disney song parodies at Everest levels ... it 's Amy Adams calling on New York 's creatures of the forest to tidy up Patrick Dempsey 's apartment that pulls it off to perfection .

 = = = Academy Award nomination and aftermath = = = 
 " Happy Working Song " was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 80th Academy Awards in 2008 alongside Enchanted songs " That 's How You Know " and " So Close " , ultimately dominating the category . However , the song was generally not favored to win by the media in spite of the fact that it was vastly a critical success . According to a poll conducted by Billboard in anticipation of the ceremony , when the magazine asked 155 of its readers " Who gets your vote for best original song in a motion picture at the Academy Awards ? " ; only 5 % of them voted in favor of " Happy Working Song " winning the award while 10 % voted for " So Close " and 24 % voted for " That 's How You Know " . In addition to this , 6 % of readers voted for August Rush 's " Raise It Up " and 22 % voted for Glen Hansard and <unk> <unk> 's " Falling Slowly " from Once ( 2007 ) . Ultimately , " Happy Working Song " lost to " Falling Slowly " . Menken believes that his compositions did not win the Best Original Song award because of the fact that three of them had been nominated at once . 
 Famously , Enchanted became the fourth out of only four films in the history of the Academy Awards to receive three separate Academy Award nominations in the Best Original Song category , having been preceded by Disney 's own Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King ( 1994 ) at the 64th and 67th Academy Awards in 1992 and 1995 , respectively , and Dreamgirls ( 2006 ) at the 79th Academy Awards in 2007 . In anticipation of the 81st Academy Awards occurring the following year in 2009 , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ultimately decided to prohibit and prevent this rare feat from reoccurring at upcoming ceremonies by limiting the maximum number of Best Original Song nominations from any one film to a total of only two per film . 
 = = Live performance and Kristin Chenoweth controversy = = 
 Adams ' first live performance of " Happy Working Song " was at the 80th Academy Awards ceremony in 2008 . Performing at approximately 6 : 01 pm local time , Adams was reportedly very nervous during and after her performance , revealing to The Huffington Post , " I don 't know how I did that . It 's the thing that was the most terrifying that I 've ever done , and the thing I 'm most proud of in my career . " Subsequently , Adams told Vulture.com that she would likely perform at the Academy Awards again " As long as [ she ] wasn 't doing it by [ her ] self " . 
 Adams ' live rendition of " Happy Working Song " was generally well @-@ received by critics . George Lang of The Oklahoman described it as a " perky " performance , additionally commenting , " [ Adams is ] great ... and she should have already racked up her first Oscar for acting by now . " The Boston Globe 's Wesley Morris wrote , " Watching Amy Adams sing ... makes you appreciated [ sic ] the magic of the movies . " However , the performance generated some mild controversy revolving around the fact that while Adams was selected to perform " Happy Working Song " , Broadway actress and singer Kristin Chenoweth was hired to sing " That 's How You Know " live at the ceremony . When questioned about this , Disney executives told the Los Angeles Times that " it 's best [ Adams ] sing ' Happy Working Song ' because it has so many parallels to Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins " . 
 However , some critics and journalists have argued that the decision stemmed from Disney and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ' belief that Adams , predominantly a film actress , would ultimately not be able to perform " That 's How You Know " as adequately as the more experienced Chenoweth . Additionally , critics noted that while Chenoweth 's Academy Award performance was staged and choreographed as a large , extravagant number featuring " dozens of colorfully costumed dancers " , Adams performed by herself on a mostly barren stage highlighted by a " single spotlight " . Vulture.com commented about the performance , " Adams didn 't do terribly , but she 's no Broadway star , and we felt kind of awful for her . " During an interview , Adams told the New York Post that she was not upset by the Academy 's decision , instead feeling that " That 's How You Know " was the " perfect " for Chenoweth to perform .

 John Sidney McCain III ( born August 29 , 1936 ) is the senior United States Senator from Arizona . He was the Republican presidential nominee in the 2008 United States presidential election . 
 McCain followed his father and grandfather , both four @-@ star admirals , into the United States Navy , graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958 . He became a naval aviator , flying ground @-@ attack aircraft from aircraft carriers . During the Vietnam War , he was almost killed in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire . In October 1967 , while on a bombing mission over Hanoi , he was shot down , seriously injured , and captured by the North Vietnamese . He was a prisoner of war until 1973 . McCain experienced episodes of torture , and refused an out @-@ of @-@ sequence early repatriation offer . His war wounds left him with lifelong physical limitations . 
 He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and moved to Arizona , where he entered politics . Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 , he served two terms , and was then elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986 , winning re @-@ election easily four times , most recently in 2010 . While generally adhering to conservative principles , McCain at times has had a media reputation as a " maverick " for his willingness to disagree with his party on certain issues . After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the Keating Five , he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns , which eventually led to the passage of the McCain @-@ Feingold Act in 2002 . He is also known for his work towards restoring diplomatic relations with Vietnam in the 1990s , and for his belief that the Iraq War should be fought to a successful conclusion . McCain has chaired the Senate Commerce Committee , opposed spending that he considered to be pork barrel , and played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations with the bi @-@ partisan group known as the Gang of 14 . 
 McCain ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 but lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush . He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals , but fell to Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the general election , losing by a 365 – 173 electoral college margin and by 53 – 46 percent in the popular vote . He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration , especially in regard to foreign policy matters . By 2013 , however , he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment . In 2015 , McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee .

 McCain 's family tree includes Scots @-@ Irish and English ancestors . His father and his paternal grandfather , John S. McCain Sr. , both became four @-@ star United States Navy admirals . The McCain family followed his father to various naval postings in the United States and the Pacific . Altogether , he attended about 20 schools . In 1951 , the family settled in Northern Virginia , and McCain attended Episcopal High School , a private preparatory boarding school in Alexandria . He excelled at wrestling and graduated in 1954 . 
 Following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather , McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis . There , he was a friend and informal leader for many of his classmates , and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying . He also became a lightweight boxer . McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him , such as literature and history , but studied only enough to pass subjects he struggled with , such as mathematics . He came into conflict with higher @-@ ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules , which contributed to a low class rank ( 894 of 899 ) , despite a high IQ . McCain graduated in 1958 . 
 = = = Naval training , first marriage , and Vietnam assignment = = = 
 McCain 's early military career began when he was commissioned an ensign and started two and a half years of training at Pensacola to become a naval aviator . While there , he earned a reputation as a partying man . He completed flight school in 1960 , and became a naval pilot of ground @-@ attack aircraft , assigned to A @-@ 1 Skyraider squadrons aboard the aircraft carriers USS Intrepid and USS Enterprise in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas . McCain began as a sub @-@ par flier who was at times careless and reckless ; during the early to mid @-@ 1960s , the planes he was flying crashed twice and once collided with power lines , but he received no major injuries . His aviation skills improved over time , and he was seen as a good pilot , albeit one who tended to " push the envelope " in his flying . 
 On July 3 , 1965 , McCain married Carol Shepp , a model originally from Philadelphia . McCain adopted her two young children Douglas and Andrew . He and Carol then had a daughter named Sidney . 
 McCain requested a combat assignment , and was assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal flying A @-@ 4 Skyhawks . His combat duty began when he was 30 years old , in mid @-@ 1967 , when Forrestal was assigned to a bombing campaign , Operation Rolling Thunder , during the Vietnam War . Stationed in the Gulf of Tonkin , McCain and his fellow pilots became frustrated by micromanagement from Washington , and he would later write that " In all candor , we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who didn 't have the least notion of what it took to win the war . " 
 On July 29 , 1967 , McCain , by then a lieutenant commander , was near the epicenter of the USS Forrestal fire . He escaped from his burning jet and was trying to help another pilot escape when a bomb exploded ; McCain was struck in the legs and chest by fragments . The ensuing fire killed 134 sailors and took 24 hours to control . With the Forrestal out of commission , McCain volunteered for assignment with the USS Oriskany , another aircraft carrier employed in Operation Rolling Thunder . Once there , he would be awarded the Navy Commendation Medal and the Bronze Star for missions flown over North Vietnam . 
 = = = Prisoner of war = = = 
 McCain 's capture and subsequent imprisonment began on October 26 , 1967 . He was flying his 23rd bombing mission over North Vietnam when his A @-@ 4E Skyhawk was shot down by a missile over Hanoi . McCain fractured both arms and a leg ejecting from the aircraft , and nearly drowned when he parachuted into <unk> Bạch Lake . Some North Vietnamese pulled him ashore , then others crushed his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him . McCain was then transported to Hanoi 's main Hỏa Lò Prison , nicknamed the " Hanoi Hilton " . 
 Although McCain was badly wounded , his captors refused to treat his injuries , beating and interrogating him to get information ; he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a high @-@ ranking admiral . His status as a prisoner of war ( POW ) made the front pages of major newspapers . 
 McCain spent six weeks in the hospital while receiving marginal care . By then having lost 50 pounds ( 23 kg ) , in a chest cast , and with his gray hair turned white as snow , McCain was sent to a different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi in December 1967 , into a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to live a week . In March 1968 , McCain was put into solitary confinement , where he would remain for two years . 
 In mid @-@ 1968 , John S. McCain Jr. was named commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater , and the North Vietnamese offered McCain early release because they wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes , and also to show other POWs that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially . McCain turned down the offer ; he would only accept repatriation if every man taken in before him was released as well . Such early release was prohibited by the POW 's interpretation of the military Code of Conduct : To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda , officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured . 
 In August 1968 , a program of severe torture began on McCain . He was subjected to rope bindings and repeated beatings every two hours , at the same time as he was suffering from dysentery . Further injuries led to the beginning of a suicide attempt , stopped by guards . Eventually , McCain made an anti @-@ American propaganda " confession " . He has always felt that his statement was dishonorable , but as he later wrote , " I had learned what we all learned over there : Every man has his breaking point . I had reached mine . " Many American POWs were tortured and maltreated in order to extract " confessions " and propaganda statements ; virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors . McCain subsequently received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements . 
 McCain refused to meet with various anti @-@ war groups seeking peace in Hanoi , wanting to give neither them nor the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory . From late 1969 onward , treatment of McCain and many of the other POWs became more tolerable , while McCain continued actively to resist the camp authorities . McCain and other prisoners cheered the U.S. " Christmas Bombing " campaign of December 1972 , viewing it as a forceful measure to push North Vietnam to terms . 
 Altogether , McCain was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years . He was released on March 14 , 1973 . His wartime injuries left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head . 
 = = = Commanding officer , liaison to Senate , and second marriage = = = 
 McCain 's return to the United States reunited him with his family . His wife Carol had suffered her own crippling ordeal due to an automobile accident in December 1969 . McCain became a celebrity of sorts , as a returned POW . 
 McCain underwent treatment for his injuries , including months of grueling physical therapy , and attended the National War College at Fort McNair in Washington , D.C. during 1973 – 1974 . Having been rehabilitated , by late 1974 , McCain had his flight status reinstated , and in 1976 he became commanding officer of a training squadron stationed in Florida . He improved the unit 's flight readiness and safety records , and won the squadron its first @-@ ever Meritorious Unit Commendation . During this period in Florida , McCain had extramarital affairs , and the McCains ' marriage began to falter , for which he later would accept blame . 
 McCain served as the Navy 's liaison to the U.S. Senate beginning in 1977 . In retrospect , he has said that this represented his " real entry into the world of politics and the beginning of my second career as a public servant . " His key behind @-@ the @-@ scenes role gained congressional financing for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration . 
 In April 1979 , McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley , a teacher from Phoenix , Arizona , whose father had founded a large beer distributorship . They began dating , and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce , which she did in February 1980 , with the uncontested divorce taking effect in April 1980 . The settlement included two houses , and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident ; they would remain on good terms . McCain and Hensley were married on May 17 , 1980 , with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen . McCain 's children did not attend , and several years would pass before they reconciled . John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family 's assets under her name ; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns . 
 McCain decided to leave the Navy . It was doubtful whether he would ever be promoted to the rank of full admiral , as he had poor annual physicals and had been given no major sea command . His chances of being promoted to rear admiral were better , but McCain declined that prospect , as he had already made plans to run for Congress and said he could " do more good there . " McCain retired from the Navy on April 1 , 1981 , as a captain . He was designated as disabled and awarded a disability pension . Upon leaving the military , he moved to Arizona . His 17 military awards and decorations include the Silver Star , Legion of Merit , Distinguished Flying Cross , Bronze Star and Navy Commendation Medal , for actions before , during , and after his time as a POW . 
 = = House and Senate elections and career , 1982 – 2000 = = 
 = = = U.S. Congressman = = = 
 McCain set his sights on becoming a congressman because he was interested in current events , was ready for a new challenge , and had developed political ambitions during his time as Senate liaison . Living in Phoenix , he went to work for Hensley & Co . , his new father @-@ in @-@ law Jim Hensley 's large Anheuser @-@ Busch beer distributorship . As vice president of public relations at the distributorship , he gained political support among the local business community , meeting powerful figures such as banker Charles Keating Jr . , real estate developer Fife Symington III and newspaper publisher Darrow " Duke " Tully . In 1982 , McCain ran as a Republican for an open seat in Arizona 's 1st congressional district , which was being vacated by 30 @-@ year incumbent Republican John Jacob Rhodes . A newcomer to the state , McCain was hit with charges of being a carpetbagger . McCain responded to a voter making that charge with what a Phoenix Gazette columnist would later describe as " the most devastating response to a potentially troublesome political issue I 've ever heard " : 
 Listen , pal . I spent 22 years in the Navy . My father was in the Navy . My grandfather was in the Navy . We in the military service tend to move a lot . We have to live in all parts of the country , all parts of the world . I wish I could have had the luxury , like you , of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the First District of Arizona , but I was doing other things . As a matter of fact , when I think about it now , the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi . 
 With the assistance of local political endorsements , his Washington connections , as well as money that his wife lent to his campaign , McCain won a highly contested primary election . He then easily won the general election in the heavily Republican district . 
 In 1983 , McCain was elected to lead the incoming group of Republican representatives , and was assigned to the House Committee on Interior Affairs . Also that year , he opposed creation of a federal Martin Luther King Jr . Day , but admitted in 2008 : " I was wrong and eventually realized that , in time to give full support [ in 1990 ] for a state holiday in Arizona . " 
 McCain 's politics at this point were mainly in line with President Ronald Reagan , including support for Reaganomics , and he was active on Indian Affairs bills . He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration , including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts , such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua . McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing unattainable objectives , and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late ; in the interim , the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds . McCain won re @-@ election to the House easily in 1984 , and gained a spot on the House Foreign Affairs Committee . In 1985 , he made his first return trip to Vietnam , and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler , General Augusto Pinochet . 
 = = = Growing family = = = 
 In 1984 , McCain and Cindy had their first child together , daughter Meghan , followed two years later by son John Sidney ( Jack ) IV , and in 1988 by son James ( Jimmy ) . In 1991 , Cindy McCain brought an abandoned three @-@ month @-@ old girl needing medical treatment to the U.S. from a Bangladeshi orphanage run by Mother Teresa . The McCains decided to adopt her and named her Bridget . 
 = = = First two terms in U.S. Senate = = = 
 McCain 's Senate career began in January 1987 , after he defeated his Democratic opponent , former state legislator Richard Kimball , by 20 percentage points in the 1986 election . McCain succeeded longtime American conservative icon and Arizona fixture Barry Goldwater upon the latter 's retirement as U.S. senator from Arizona . 
 Senator McCain became a member of the Armed Services Committee , with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work ; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee . He continued to support the Native American agenda . As first a House member and then a senator – and as a lifelong gambler with close ties to the gambling industry – McCain was one of the main authors of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act , which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises . McCain was also a strong supporter of the Gramm @-@ Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits . 
 McCain soon gained national visibility . He delivered a well @-@ received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention , was mentioned by the press as a short list vice @-@ presidential running mate for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush , and was named chairman of Veterans for Bush . 
 McCain became embroiled in a scandal during the 1980s , as one of five United States senators comprising the so @-@ called Keating Five . Between 1982 and 1987 , McCain had received $ 112 @,@ 000 in lawful political contributions from Charles Keating Jr. and his associates at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association , along with trips on Keating 's jets that McCain belatedly repaid , in 1989 . In 1987 , McCain was one of the five senators whom Keating contacted in order to prevent the government 's seizure of Lincoln , and McCain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the government 's investigation of Lincoln . In 1999 , McCain said : " The appearance of it was wrong . It 's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators , because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence . And it was the wrong thing to do . " In the end , McCain was cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee of acting improperly or violating any law or Senate rule , but was mildly rebuked for exercising " poor judgment " . In his 1992 re @-@ election bid , the Keating Five affair was not a major issue , and he won handily , gaining 56 percent of the vote to defeat Democratic community and civil rights activist Claire Sargent and independent former governor , Evan Mecham . 
 McCain developed a reputation for independence during the 1990s . He took pride in challenging party leadership and establishment forces , becoming difficult to categorize politically . 
 As a member of the 1991 – 1993 Senate Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs , chaired by fellow Vietnam War veteran and Democrat , John Kerry , McCain investigated the Vietnam War POW / MIA issue , to determine the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War . The committee 's unanimous report stated there was " no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia . " Helped by McCain 's efforts , in 1995 the U.S. normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam . McCain was vilified by some POW / MIA activists who , unlike the Arizona senator , believed large numbers of Americans were still held against their will in Southeast Asia . Since January 1993 , McCain has been Chairman of the International Republican Institute , an organization partly funded by the U.S. Government that supports the emergence of political democracy worldwide . 
 In 1993 and 1994 , McCain voted to confirm President Clinton 's nominees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg whom he considered to be qualified for the U.S. Supreme Court . He would later explain that " under our Constitution , it is the president 's call to make . " McCain had also voted to confirm nominees of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush , including Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas . 
 McCain attacked what he saw as the corrupting influence of large political contributions – from corporations , labor unions , other organizations , and wealthy individuals – and he made this his signature issue . Starting in 1994 , he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform ; their McCain @-@ Feingold bill attempted to put limits on " soft money " . The efforts of McCain and Feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted , by incumbents in both parties , by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well , and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias . Despite sympathetic coverage in the media , initial versions of the McCain @-@ Feingold Act were filibustered and never came to a vote . 
 The term " maverick Republican " became a label frequently applied to McCain , and he has also used it himself . In 1993 , McCain opposed military operations in Somalia . Another target of his was pork barrel spending by Congress , and he actively supported the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 , which gave the president power to veto individual spending items but was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1998 . 
 In the 1996 presidential election , McCain was again on the short list of possible vice @-@ presidential picks , this time for Republican nominee Bob Dole . The following year , Time magazine named McCain as one of the " 25 Most Influential People in America " . 
 In 1997 , McCain became chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee ; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee 's purview , but in response said the small contributions he received were not part of the big @-@ money nature of the campaign finance problem . McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998 , proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti @-@ smoking campaigns , discourage teenage smokers , increase money for health research studies , and help states pay for smoking @-@ related health care costs . Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans , the bill failed to gain cloture . 
 = = = Start of third term in the U.S. Senate = = = 
 McCain won re @-@ election to a third senate term in November 1998 , prevailing in a landslide over his Democratic opponent , environmental lawyer Ed Ranger . In the February 1999 Senate trial following the impeachment of Bill Clinton , McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury and obstruction of justice counts , saying Clinton had violated his sworn oath of office . In March 1999 , McCain voted to approve the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , saying that the ongoing genocide of the Kosovo War must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction . Later in 1999 , McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact their campaign finance reform , although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain cloture . 
 In August 1999 , McCain 's memoir Faith of My Fathers , co @-@ authored with Mark Salter , was published ; a reviewer observed that its appearance " seems to have been timed to the unfolding Presidential campaign . " The most successful of his writings , it received positive reviews , became a bestseller , and was later made into a TV film . The book traces McCain 's family background and childhood , covers his time at Annapolis and his service before and during the Vietnam War , concluding with his release from captivity in 1973 . According to one reviewer , it describes " the kind of challenges that most of us can barely imagine . It 's a fascinating history of a remarkable military family . "

 McCain announced his candidacy for president on September 27 , 1999 , in Nashua , New Hampshire , saying he was staging " a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests , and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve " . The leader for the Republican nomination was Texas Governor George W. Bush , who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment . 
 McCain focused on the New Hampshire primary , where his message appealed to independents . He traveled on a campaign bus called the Straight Talk Express . He held many town hall meetings , answering every question voters asked , in a successful example of " retail politics " , and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds . One reporter later recounted that , " McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus ; he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldn 't have , and that 's why the media loved him . " On February 1 , 2000 , he won New Hampshire 's primary with 49 percent of the vote to Bush 's 30 percent . The Bush campaign and the Republican establishment feared that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum . 
 The Arizona Republic would write that the McCain – Bush primary contest in South Carolina " has entered national political lore as a low @-@ water mark in presidential campaigns " , while The New York Times called it " a painful symbol of the brutality of American politics " . A variety of interest groups that McCain had challenged in the past ran negative ads . Bush borrowed McCain 's earlier language of reform , and declined to dissociate himself from a veterans activist who accused McCain ( in Bush 's presence ) of having " abandoned the veterans " on POW / MIA and Agent Orange issues . 
 Incensed , McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton , which Bush said was " about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary " . An anonymous smear campaign began against McCain , delivered by push polls , faxes , e @-@ mails , flyers , and audience plants . The smears claimed that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock ( the McCains ' dark @-@ skinned daughter was adopted from Bangladesh ) , that his wife Cindy was a drug addict , that he was a homosexual , and that he was a " Manchurian Candidate " who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days . The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks . 
 McCain lost South Carolina on February 19 , with 42 percent of the vote to Bush 's 53 percent , in part because Bush mobilized the state 's evangelical voters and outspent McCain . The win allowed Bush to regain lost momentum . McCain would say of the rumor spreaders , " I believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those . " According to one report , the South Carolina experience left McCain in a " very dark place " . 
 McCain 's campaign never completely recovered from his South Carolina defeat , although he did rebound partially by winning in Arizona and Michigan a few days later . He made a speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders , including Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell , as divisive conservatives , declaring " ... we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community . But that does not mean that we will pander to their self @-@ appointed leaders . " McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29 , and on March 7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on Super Tuesday to Bush . With little hope of overcoming Bush 's delegate lead , McCain withdrew from the race on March 9 , 2000 . He endorsed Bush two months later , and made occasional appearances with the Texas governor during the general election campaign .

 McCain began 2001 by breaking with the new George W. Bush administration on a number of matters , including HMO reform , climate change , and gun legislation ; McCain @-@ Feingold was opposed by Bush as well . In May 2001 , McCain was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against the Bush tax cuts . Besides the differences with Bush on ideological grounds , there was considerable antagonism between the two remaining from the previous year 's campaign . Later , when a Republican senator , Jim Jeffords , became an Independent , thereby throwing control of the Senate to the Democrats , McCain defended Jeffords against " self @-@ appointed enforcers of party loyalty " . Indeed , there was speculation at the time , and in years since , about McCain himself leaving the Republican Party , but McCain has always adamantly denied that he ever considered doing so . Beginning in 2001 , McCain used political capital gained from his presidential run , as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members , to become one of the Senate 's most influential members . 
 After the September 11 , 2001 attacks , McCain supported Bush and the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan . He and Democratic senator Joe Lieberman wrote the legislation that created the 9 / 11 Commission , while he and Democratic senator Fritz Hollings co @-@ sponsored the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that federalized airport security . 
 In March 2002 , McCain @-@ Feingold passed in both Houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Bush . Seven years in the making , it was McCain 's greatest legislative achievement . 
 Meanwhile , in discussions over proposed U.S. action against Iraq , McCain was a strong supporter of the Bush administration 's position . He stated that Iraq was " a clear and present danger to the United States of America " , and voted accordingly for the Iraq War Resolution in October 2002 . He predicted that U.S. forces would be treated as liberators by a large number of the Iraqi people . In May 2003 , McCain voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts , saying it was unwise at a time of war . By November 2003 , after a trip to Iraq , he was publicly questioning Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , saying that more U.S. troops were needed ; the following year , McCain announced that he had lost confidence in Rumsfeld . 
 In October 2003 , McCain and Lieberman co @-@ sponsored the Climate Stewardship Act that would have introduced a cap and trade system aimed at returning greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels ; the bill was defeated with 55 votes to 43 in the Senate . They reintroduced modified versions of the Act two additional times , most recently in January 2007 with the co @-@ sponsorship of Barack Obama , among others . 
 In the 2004 U.S. presidential election campaign , McCain was once again frequently mentioned for the vice @-@ presidential slot , only this time as part of the Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry . McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had . At the 2004 Republican National Convention , McCain supported Bush for re @-@ election , praising Bush 's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks . At the same time , he defended Kerry 's Vietnam war record . By August 2004 , McCain had the best favorable @-@ to @-@ unfavorable rating ( 55 percent to 19 percent ) of any national politician ; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously , though the two remained situational allies rather than friends . 
 McCain was also up for re @-@ election as senator , in 2004 . He defeated little @-@ known Democratic schoolteacher Stuart Starky with his biggest margin of victory , garnering 77 percent of the vote . 
 = = = Start of fourth Senate term = = = 
 In May 2005 , McCain led the so @-@ called Gang of 14 in the Senate , which established a compromise that preserved the ability of senators to filibuster judicial nominees , but only in " extraordinary circumstances " . The compromise took the steam out of the filibuster movement , but some Republicans remained disappointed that the compromise did not eliminate filibusters of judicial nominees in all circumstances . McCain subsequently cast Supreme Court confirmation votes in favor of John Roberts and Samuel Alito , calling them " two of the finest justices ever appointed to the United States Supreme Court . " 
 Breaking from his 2001 and 2003 votes , McCain supported the Bush tax cut extension in May 2006 , saying not to do so would amount to a tax increase . Working with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy , McCain was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform , which would involve legalization , guest worker programs , and border enforcement components . The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act was never voted on in 2005 , while the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed the Senate in May 2006 but failed in the House . In June 2007 , President Bush , McCain , and others made the strongest push yet for such a bill , the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 , but it aroused intense grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others , some of whom furiously characterized the proposal as an " amnesty " program , and the bill twice failed to gain cloture in the Senate . 
 By the middle of the 2000s ( decade ) , the increased Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring about was a $ 23 billion industry . He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee , in 1995 – 1997 and 2005 – 2007 , and his Committee helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal . By 2005 and 2006 , McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would limit creation of off @-@ reservation casinos , as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos . 
 Owing to his time as a POW , McCain has been recognized for his sensitivity to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the War on Terror . In October 2005 , McCain introduced the McCain Detainee Amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005 , and the Senate voted 90 – 9 to support the amendment . It prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners , including prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , by confining military interrogations to the techniques in the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation . Although Bush had threatened to veto the bill if McCain 's amendment was included , the President announced in December 2005 that he accepted McCain 's terms and would " make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture , whether it be here at home or abroad " . This stance , among others , led to McCain being named by Time magazine in 2006 as one of America 's 10 Best Senators . McCain voted in February 2008 against a bill containing a ban on waterboarding , which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by Bush . However , the bill in question contained other provisions to which McCain objected , and his spokesman stated : " This wasn 't a vote on waterboarding . This was a vote on applying the standards of the [ Army ] field manual to CIA personnel . " 
 Meanwhile , McCain continued questioning the progress of the war in Iraq . In September 2005 , he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers ' optimistic outlook on the war 's progress : " Things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected , nor as we were told by you , General Myers . " In August 2006 , he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency : " We [ have ] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be . " From the beginning , McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007 . The strategy 's opponents labeled it " McCain 's plan " and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said , " McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now . " The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year , even within the Republican Party , as McCain 's presidential campaign was underway ; faced with the consequences , McCain frequently responded , " I would much rather lose a campaign than a war . " In March 2008 , McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq , as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began . 
 = = 2008 presidential campaign = = 
 McCain formally announced his intention to run for President of the United States on April 25 , 2007 in Portsmouth , New Hampshire . He stated that : " I 'm not running for president to be somebody , but to do something ; to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things . " 
 McCain 's oft @-@ cited strengths as a presidential candidate for 2008 included national name recognition , sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives , his ability to reach across the aisle , his well @-@ known military service and experience as a POW , his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign , and an expectation that he would capture Bush 's top fundraisers . During the 2006 election cycle , McCain had attended 346 events and helped raise more than $ 10 @.@ 5 million on behalf of Republican candidates . McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions , while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make . Despite being considered the front @-@ runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began , McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed . 
 McCain had fundraising problems in the first half of 2007 , due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 , which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate . Large @-@ scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July , but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race . Later that month , the candidate 's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed . McCain slumped badly in national polls , often running third or fourth with 15 percent or less support . 
 The Arizona senator subsequently resumed his familiar position as a political underdog , riding the Straight Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events . By December 2007 , the Republican race was unsettled , with none of the top @-@ tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the Republican base electorate . McCain was showing a resurgence , in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire – the scene of his 2000 triumph – and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe , the New Hampshire Union Leader , and almost two dozen other state newspapers , as well as from Senator Lieberman ( now an Independent Democrat ) . McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3 , 2008 , Iowa caucuses , which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee . 
 McCain 's comeback plan paid off when he won the New Hampshire primary on January 8 , defeating former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney in a close contest , to once again become one of the front @-@ runners in the race . In mid @-@ January , McCain placed first in the South Carolina primary , narrowly defeating Mike Huckabee . Pundits credited the third @-@ place finisher , Tennessee 's former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson , with drawing votes from Huckabee in South Carolina , thereby giving a narrow win to McCain . A week later , McCain won the Florida primary , beating Romney again in a close contest ; Giuliani then dropped out and endorsed McCain . 
 On February 5 , McCain won both the majority of states and delegates in the Super Tuesday Republican primaries , giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination . Romney departed from the race on February 7 . McCain 's wins in the March 4 primaries clinched a majority of the delegates , and he became the presumptive Republican nominee . 
 McCain , having been born in the Panama Canal Zone , if elected would have become the first president who was born outside the current 50 states . This raised a potential legal issue , since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural @-@ born citizen of the United States . A bipartisan legal review , and a unanimous but non @-@ binding Senate resolution , both concluded that he is a natural @-@ born citizen . Also , if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72 years and 144 days , he would have been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency , and the second @-@ oldest president to be inaugurated . 
 McCain addressed concerns about his age and past health concerns , stating in 2005 that his health was " excellent " . He had been treated for a type of skin cancer called melanoma , and an operation in 2000 for that condition left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face . McCain 's prognosis appeared favorable , according to independent experts , especially because he had already survived without a recurrence for more than seven years . In May 2008 , McCain 's campaign briefly let the press review his medical records , and he was described as appearing cancer @-@ free , having a strong heart , and in general being in good health . 
 Upon clinching enough delegates for the nomination , McCain 's focus shifted toward the general election , while Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton fought a prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination . McCain introduced various policy proposals , and sought to improve his fundraising . Cindy McCain , who accounts for most of the couple 's wealth with an estimated net worth of $ 100 million , made part of her tax returns public in May . After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff , the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest , causing five top aides to leave . 
 When Obama became the Democrats ' presumptive nominee in early June , McCain proposed joint town hall meetings , but Obama instead requested more traditional debates for the fall . In July , a staff shake @-@ up put Steve Schmidt in full operational control of the McCain campaign . Throughout these summer months , Obama typically led McCain in national polls by single @-@ digit margins , and also led in several key swing states . McCain reprised his familiar underdog role , which was due at least in part to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year . McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign , and the restrictions that go with it , while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976 . The Republican 's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead , compared to Obama 's . 
 Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was revealed as McCain 's surprise choice for running mate on August 29 , 2008 . McCain was only the second U.S. major @-@ party presidential nominee to select a woman for running mate and the first Republican to do so ; Palin would have become the first female Vice President of the United States if she had been elected . On September 3 , 2008 , McCain and Palin became the Republican Party 's presidential and vice presidential nominees , respectively , at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul , Minnesota . McCain surged ahead of Obama in national polls following the convention , as the Palin pick energized core Republican voters who had previously been wary of him . However , by the campaign 's own later admission , the rollout of Palin to the national media went poorly , and voter reactions to Palin grew increasingly negative , especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications . 
 On September 24 , McCain said he was suspending his campaign , called on Obama to join him , and proposed delaying the first of the general election debates with Obama , in order to work on the proposed U.S. financial system bailout before Congress , which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis . McCain 's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement . After Obama declined McCain 's suspension suggestion , McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26 . On October 1 , McCain voted in favor of a revised $ 700 billion rescue plan . Another debate was held on October 7 ; like the first one , polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it . A final presidential debate occurred on October 15 . 
 During and after the final debate , McCain compared Obama 's proposed policies to socialism and often invoked " Joe the Plumber " as a symbol of American small business dreams that would be thwarted by an Obama presidency . McCain barred using the Jeremiah Wright controversy in ads against Obama , but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding his purported relationship with Bill Ayers . McCain 's rallies became increasingly vitriolic , with attendees denigrating Obama and displaying a growing anti @-@ Muslim and anti @-@ African @-@ American sentiment . After one female McCain supporter said she did not trust Obama because " he 's an Arab " , McCain pointedly replied to the woman , " No ma 'am . He 's a decent family man , citizen , that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues . " McCain 's response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in American politics . Down the stretch , McCain was outspent by Obama by a four @-@ to @-@ one margin . 
 The election took place on November 4 , and Barack Obama was projected the winner at about 11 : 00 pm Eastern Standard Time ; McCain delivered his concession speech in Phoenix , Arizona about twenty minutes later . In it , he noted the historic and special significance of Obama becoming the nation 's first African American president . In the end , McCain won 173 electoral college votes to Obama 's 365 ; McCain failed to win most of the battleground states and lost some traditionally Republican ones . McCain gained 46 percent of the nationwide popular vote , compared to Obama 's 53 percent .

 Following his defeat , McCain returned to the Senate amid varying views about what role he might play there . In mid @-@ November 2008 he met with President @-@ elect Obama , and the two discussed issues they had commonality on . Around the same time , McCain indicated that he intended to run for re @-@ election to his Senate seat in 2010 . As the inauguration neared , Obama consulted with McCain on a variety of matters , to an extent rarely seen between a president @-@ elect and his defeated rival , and President Obama 's inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain 's theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself . 
 Nevertheless , McCain emerged as a leader of the Republican opposition to the Obama economic stimulus package of 2009 , saying it had too much spending for too little stimulative effect . McCain also voted against Obama 's Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor – saying that while undeniably qualified , " I do not believe that she shares my belief in judicial restraint " – and by August 2009 was siding more often with his Republican Party on closely divided votes than ever before in his senatorial career . McCain reasserted that the Afghanistan War was winnable and criticized Obama for a slow process in deciding whether to send additional U.S. troops there . 
 McCain also harshly criticized Obama for scrapping construction of the U.S. missile defense complex in Poland , declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar to what he had proposed in the past , and strongly opposed the Obama health care plan . McCain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the military 's " Don 't ask , don 't tell " policy towards gays . Factors involved in McCain 's new direction included Senate staffers leaving , a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government , a possible Republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010 , and McCain 's campaign edge being slow to wear off . As one longtime McCain advisor said , " A lot of people , including me , thought he might be the Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration . But he 's been more like the guy blowing up the bridges . " 
 In early 2010 , a primary challenge from radio talk show host and former U.S. Congressman J. D. Hayworth materialized in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the Tea Party movement . With Hayworth using the campaign slogan " The Consistent Conservative " , McCain said – despite his own past use of the term on a number of occasions – " I never considered myself a maverick . I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities . " The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts , closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention facility , campaign finance restrictions , and gays in the military . 
 When the health care plan , now called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , passed Congress and became law in March 2010 , McCain strongly opposed the landmark legislation not only on its merits but also on the way it had been handled in Congress . As a consequence , he warned that congressional Republicans would not be working with Democrats on anything else : " There will be no cooperation for the rest of the year . They have poisoned the well in what they 've done and how they 've done it . " McCain became a vocal defender of Arizona SB 1070 , the April 2010 tough anti @-@ illegal immigration state law that aroused national controversy , saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal government 's inability to control the border . In the August 24 primary , McCain beat Hayworth by a 56 to 32 percent margin . McCain proceeded to easily defeat Democratic city councilman Rodney Glassman in the general election . 
 In the lame duck session of the 111th Congress , McCain voted for the compromise Tax Relief , Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization , and Job Creation Act of 2010 , but against the DREAM Act ( which he had once sponsored ) and the New START Treaty . Most prominently , he continued to lead the eventually losing fight against " Don 't ask , don 't tell " repeal . In his opposition , he sometimes fell into anger or hostility on the Senate floor , and called its passage " a very sad day " that would compromise the battle effectiveness of the military .

 While control of the House of Representatives went over to the Republicans in the 112th Congress , the Senate stayed Democratic and McCain continued to be the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee . As the Arab Spring took center stage , McCain urged that the embattled Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , step down and thought the U.S. should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power . McCain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya . In April of that year he visited the Anti @-@ Gaddafi forces and National Transitional Council in Benghazi , the highest @-@ ranking American to do so , and said that the rebel forces were " my heroes " . In June , he joined with Senator Kerry in offering a resolution that would have authorized the military intervention , and said : " The administration 's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive . " In August , McCain voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved the U.S. debt ceiling crisis . In November , McCain and Senator Carl Levin were leaders in efforts to codify in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 that terrorism suspects , no matter where captured , could be detained by the U.S. military and its tribunal system ; following objections by civil libertarians , some Democrats , and the White House , McCain and Levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to U.S. citizens . 
 In the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries , McCain endorsed former 2008 rival Mitt Romney and campaigned for him , but compared the contest to a Greek tragedy due to its drawn @-@ out nature with massive Super PAC @-@ funded attack ads damaging all the contenders . He labelled the Supreme Court 's 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision as " uninformed , arrogant , naïve , " and , decrying its effects and the future scandals he thought it would bring , said it would become considered the court 's " worst decision ... in the 21st century " . McCain took the lead in opposing the defense spending <unk> brought on by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and gained attention for defending State Department aide Huma <unk> against charges brought by a few House Republicans that she had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood . 
 McCain continued to be one of the most frequently appearing guests on the Sunday morning news talk shows . He became one of the most vocal critics of the Obama administration 's handling of the September 11 , 2012 , attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi , saying it was a " debacle " that featured either " a massive cover @-@ up or incompetence that is not acceptable " and that it was worse than the Watergate scandal . As part of this , he and a few other senators were successful in blocking the planned nomination of Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as U.S. Secretary of State ; McCain 's friend and colleague John Kerry was nominated instead . 
 Regarding the Syrian civil war that had begun in 2011 , McCain repeatedly argued for the U.S. intervening militarily in the conflict on the side of the anti @-@ government forces . He staged a visit to rebel forces inside Syria in May 2013 , the first senator to do so , and called for arming the Free Syrian Army with heavy weapons and for the establishment of a no @-@ fly zone over the country . Following reports that two of the people he posed for pictures with had been responsible for the kidnapping of eleven Lebanese Shiite pilgrims the year before , McCain disputed one of the identifications and said he had not met directly with the other . Following the 2013 Ghouta chemical weapons attack , McCain argued again for strong American military action against the government of the Syrian president , Bashar al @-@ Assad , and in September 2013 cast a Foreign Relations committee vote in favor of Obama 's request to Congress that it authorize a military response . McCain took the lead in criticizing a growing non @-@ interventionist movement within the Republican Party , exemplified by his March 2013 comment that Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and Representative Justin Amash were " wacko birds " . 
 During 2013 , McCain was a member of a bi @-@ partisan group of senators , the " Gang of Eight " , which announced principles for another try at comprehensive immigration reform . The resulting Border Security , Economic Opportunity , and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 passed the Senate by a 68 – 32 margin , but faced an uncertain future in the House . In July 2013 , McCain was at the forefront of an agreement among senators to drop filibusters against Obama administration executive nominees without Democrats resorting to the " nuclear option " that would disallow such filibusters altogether . However , the option would be imposed later in the year anyway , much to the senator 's displeasure . These developments and some other negotiations showed that McCain now had improved relations with the Obama administration , including the president himself , as well as with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , and that he had become the leader of a power center in the Senate for cutting deals in an otherwise bitterly partisan environment . They also led some observers to conclude that the " maverick " McCain had returned . 
 McCain was publicly skeptical about the Republican strategy that precipitated the U.S. federal government shutdown of 2013 and U.S. debt @-@ ceiling crisis of 2013 in order to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act ; in October 2013 he voted in favor of the Continuing Appropriations Act , 2014 , which resolved them and said , " Republicans have to understand we have lost this battle , as I predicted weeks ago , that we would not be able to win because we were demanding something that was not achievable . " Similarly , he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the end of the year . By early 2014 , McCain 's <unk> were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been " disastrous and harmful " . McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama 's foreign policy , however , and in June 2014 , following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive , decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president 's entire national security team to resign . McCain said , " Could all this have been avoided ? ... The answer is absolutely yes . If I sound angry it 's because I am angry . " 
 McCain was a supporter of the Euromaidan protests against Ukraine leader Viktor Yanukovych and his government , and appeared in Independence Square in Kiev in December 2013 . Following the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine , McCain became a vocal supporter of providing arms to Ukrainian military forces , saying the sanctions imposed against Russia were not enough . In 2014 , McCain led the opposition to the appointments of Colleen Bell , Noah Mamet , and George <unk> to the ambassadorships in Hungary , Argentina , and Norway , respectively , arguing they were unqualified appointees being rewarded for their political fundraising . Unlike many Republicans , McCain supported the release and contents of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture in December 2014 , saying " The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow . It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad . It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us . But the American people are entitled to it , nonetheless . " He added that the CIA 's practices following the September 11 attacks had " stained our national honor " while doing " much harm and little practical good " and that " Our enemies act without conscience . We must not . " He opposed the Obama administration 's December 2014 decision to normalize relations with Cuba . 
 As the 114th United States Congress assembled in January 2015 with Republicans in control of the Senate , McCain became chair of the Armed Services Committee , a longtime goal of his . In this position , he led the writing of proposed Senate legislation that sought to modify parts of the Goldwater @-@ Nichols Act of 1986 in order to return responsibility for major weapons systems acquisition back to the individual armed services and their secretaries and away from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition , Technology and Logistics . As chair , McCain has tried to maintain a bipartisan approach and has forged a good relationship with ranking member Jack Reed . In April 2015 , McCain announced that he would run for a sixth term in Arizona 's 2016 Senate election . While there was still conservative and Tea Party anger at him , it was unclear if they would mount an effective primary challenge against him . During 2015 , McCain strongly opposed the proposed comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear program , saying that Secretary of State Kerry was " delusional " and " giv [ ing ] away the store " in negotiations with Iran . McCain supported the 2015 Saudi Arabian @-@ led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh . 
 In the Republican Party presidential primaries , 2016 , McCain said he would support the Republican nominee even if it was Donald Trump , but following Mitt Romney 's March 3 speech , McCain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech , saying he had serious concerns about Trump 's " uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues " . Relations between the two had been fraught since early in the Donald Trump presidential campaign , 2016 , when the real estate mogul had said of McCain , saying " He 's not a war hero . He was a war hero because he was captured ? I like people who weren 't captured . " Following Trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on May 3 , McCain said that Republican voters had spoken and he would support Trump . McCain was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from Democratic Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election and privately expressed worry over the effect that Trump 's unpopularity among Hispanic voters might have on his own chances .

 Various advocacy groups have given Senator McCain scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group . The American Conservative Union has awarded McCain a lifetime rating of 82 percent through 2014 , while McCain has an average lifetime 12 percent " Liberal Quotient " from Americans for Democratic Action through 2014 . 
 The non @-@ partisan National Journal rates a Senator 's votes by what percentage of the Senate voted more liberally than he or she , and what percentage more conservatively , in three policy areas : economic , social , and foreign . For 2005 – 2006 ( as reported in the 2008 Almanac of American Politics ) , McCain 's average ratings were as follows : economic policy : 59 percent conservative and 41 percent liberal ; social policy : 54 percent conservative and 38 percent liberal ; and foreign policy : 56 percent conservative and 43 percent liberal . 
 Columnists such as Robert Robb and Matthew <unk> have used a formulation devised by William F. Buckley Jr. to describe McCain as " conservative " but not " a conservative " , meaning that while McCain usually tends towards conservative positions , he is not " anchored by the philosophical tenets of modern American conservatism . " Following his 2008 presidential election loss , McCain began adopting more orthodox conservative views ; the magazine National Journal rated McCain along with seven of his colleagues as the " most conservative " Senators for 2010 and he achieved his first 100 percent rating from the American Conservative Union for that year . 
 From the late 1990s until 2008 , McCain was a board member of Project Vote Smart which was set up by Richard Kimball , his 1986 Senate opponent . The project provides non @-@ partisan information about the political positions of McCain and other candidates for political office . Additionally , McCain uses his Senate website to describe his political positions . 
 = = Cultural and political image = = 
 McCain 's personal character has been a dominant feature of his public image . This image includes the military service of both himself and his family , the circumstances and tensions surrounding the end of his first marriage and beginning of second , his maverick political persona , his temper , his admitted problem of occasional ill @-@ considered remarks , and his close ties to his children from both his marriages . 
 McCain 's political appeal has been more nonpartisan and less ideological compared to many other national politicians . His stature and reputation stem partly from his service in the Vietnam War . He also carries physical vestiges of his war wounds , as well as his melanoma surgery . When campaigning , he quips : " I am older than dirt and have more scars than Frankenstein . " 
 Writers often extolled McCain for his courage not just in war but in politics , and wrote sympathetically about him . McCain 's shift of political stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign , including his self @-@ repudiation of the maverick label , left many writers expressing sadness and wondering what had happened to the McCain they thought they had known . By 2013 , some aspects of the older McCain had returned , and his image became that of a kaleidoscope of contradictory tendencies , including , as one writer listed , " the maverick , the former maverick , the curmudgeon , the bridge builder , the war hero bent on transcending the call of self @-@ interest to serve a cause greater than himself , the sore loser , old bull , last lion , loose cannon , happy warrior , elder statesman , lion in winter .... " 
 In his own estimation , the Arizona senator is straightforward and direct , but impatient . Other traits include a penchant for lucky charms , a fondness for hiking , and a sense of humor that has sometimes backfired spectacularly , as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons widely deemed not fit to print in newspapers : " Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly ? – Because Janet Reno is her father . " McCain subsequently apologized profusely , and the Clinton White House accepted his apology . McCain has not shied away from addressing his shortcomings , and apologizing for them . He is known for sometimes being prickly and hot @-@ tempered with Senate colleagues , but his relations with his own Senate staff have been more cordial , and have inspired loyalty towards him . He formed a strong bond with two senators , Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham , over hawkish foreign policy and overseas travel , and they became dubbed the " Three Amigos " . 
 McCain acknowledges having said intemperate things in years past , though he also says that many stories have been exaggerated . One psychoanalytic comparison suggests that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper , and cultural critic Julia Keller argues that voters want leaders who are passionate , engaged , fiery , and feisty . McCain has employed both profanity and shouting on occasion , although such incidents have become less frequent over the years . Senator Lieberman has made this observation : " It is not the kind of anger that is a loss of control . He is a very controlled person . " Senator Thad Cochran , who has known McCain for decades and has battled him over earmarks , expressed concern about a McCain presidency : " He is erratic . He is hotheaded . He loses his temper and he worries me . " Ultimately Cochran decided to support McCain for president , after it was clear he would win the nomination . 
 All of McCain 's family members are on good terms with him , and he has defended them against some of the negative consequences of his high @-@ profile political lifestyle . His family 's military tradition extends to the latest generation : son John Sidney IV ( " Jack " ) graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2009 , becoming the fourth generation John S. McCain to do so , and is a helicopter pilot ; son James served two tours with the marines in the Iraq War ; and son Doug flew jets in the navy . His daughter Meghan became a blogging and <unk> presence in the debate about the future of the Republican Party following the 2008 elections , and showed some of his maverick tendencies .

 In addition to his military honors and decorations , McCain has been granted a number of civilian awards and honors . 
 In 1997 , Time magazine named McCain as one of the " 25 Most Influential People in America " . In 1999 , McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Senator Russ Feingold for their work towards campaign finance reform . The following year , the same pair shared the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government . In 2005 , The Eisenhower Institute awarded McCain the Eisenhower Leadership Prize . The prize recognizes individuals whose lifetime accomplishments reflect Dwight D. Eisenhower 's legacy of integrity and leadership . In 2006 , the Bruce F. Vento Public Service Award was bestowed upon McCain by the National Park Trust . The same year , McCain was awarded the Henry M. Jackson Distinguished Service Award by the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs , in honor of Senator Henry M. " Scoop " Jackson . In 2007 , the World Leadership Forum presented McCain with the <unk> of the Year Award ; it is given internationally to someone who has " created , inspired or strongly influenced important policy or legislation " . In 2010 , President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia awarded McCain the Order of National Hero , an award never previously given to a non @-@ Georgian . In 2015 , the Kiev Patriarchate awarded McCain its own version of the Order of St. Vladimir . In 2016 , Allegheny College awarded McCain , along with Vice President Joe Biden , its Prize for <unk> in Public Life . 
 McCain has received honorary degrees from colleges and universities in the United States and internationally . These include ones from Colgate University ( 2000 ) , The Citadel ( 2002 ) , Wake Forest University ( 2002 ) , the University of Southern California ( 2004 ) , Northwestern University ( 2005 ) , Liberty University ( 2006 ) , The New School 2006 ) , and the Royal Military College of Canada ( 2013 ) . He was also made an Honorary Patron of the University Philosophical Society at Trinity College Dublin in 2005 . 
 = Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building = 
 The Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building was a chemistry laboratory and classroom building on the campus of Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie , New York . The 42 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 3 @,@ 900 m2 ) postmodern building stood on the north end of a cluster of other science buildings on the site of the school 's first chemistry laboratory . It was completed in 1984 at a cost of $ 7 @.@ 2 million after the college received money from a fund bequeathed to it in the will of California cardiologist and professor Seeley G. Mudd . The structure replaced Sanders Hall of Chemistry and included elements designed to be energy efficient , notably a large wall of glass blocks that designers hoped would passively heat the building . Reviews of the structure were positive when it opened with critics praising the way its form complemented nearby older buildings . By 2015 , many aspects of the building had been evaluated as being in Fair or Poor condition and the building was demolished in spring 2016 Science Center project , to be replaced by an open green space .
