 = Tropical Storm Arlene ( 2011 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Arlene , the first named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season , brought blustery conditions to much of eastern Mexico in late June to early July 2012 . Arlene originated from an Atlantic tropical wave , which crossed the Yucatán Peninsula before emerging over warm waters in the Bay of Campeche . Despite moderate wind shear , the disturbance strengthened and developed a surface circulation , prompting the National Hurricane Center to declare it a tropical storm on June 28 . Arlene remained vigorous for most of its existence ; the storm peaked in intensity with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) on June 30 , just before making landfall on the coast of Veracruz . Crossing the mountains of eastern Mexico , Arlene weakened to a depression before dissipating early on July 1 . 
 The precursor disturbance to Arlene brought significant rainfall to parts of Central America , killing three people and triggering widespread flooding and landslides . Throughout Mexico , prolonged rains from Arlene and subsequent flooding affected hundreds of homes and several roads , causing many residents to seek shelter . At the height of the storm , power was lost to 285 @,@ 000 homes . At least 22 people in Mexico were killed by Arlene . Elsewhere , rainfall from the storm alleviated ongoing drought conditions in southern Texas and Florida . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Tropical Storm Arlene can be traced to a distinct tropical wave , embedded within an area of deep atmospheric moisture , that emerged off the coast of Africa on June 13 , 2011 . The wave tracked westward across the Atlantic for several days , reaching the western Caribbean Sea in late June . By June 24 , it began interacting with the extension of a monsoon trough in the region , generating broad cyclonic flow and scattered convection in conjunction with an upper trough to its northwest . The amplified wave slowly proceeded west @-@ northwestward along Central America , bringing heavy rainfall to the area . Initially , the disturbance 's development was impeded by the trough aloft and adjacent land , though the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) noted favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis over the Bay of Campeche , coupled with abating wind shear . On June 26 , the disturbance moved inland over the Yucatán Peninsula , emerging into the bay the next day as it produced a surface low . Despite moderate shear , a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system revealed that a closed wind circulation had formed at sea level . Thunderstorm activity became more concentrated , and the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Arlene at midnight June 29 , after the cyclone 's surface winds increased to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) about 280 mi ( 450 km ) south @-@ southeast of Tampico , Tamaulipas . 
 Over the following hours , deep convection increased around the broad storm , though its circulation center continued to lack in organization . Arlene curved to the west in response to a ridge of high pressure to its north and northwest . As the shear over the region further decreased , the large storm began to strengthen gradually , developing spiral convective bands closer to its center . Although forecast models supported intensification to hurricane status , significant development was compromised by a lack of distinguishable central features . On June 30 , just before Arlene made landfall , Dvorak satellite estimates indicated the storm had reached a peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) while accelerating off the coast of Veracruz . Arlene moved ashore near Cabo Rojo as a strong tropical storm by 09 : 00 UTC , with the severest winds confined to the north of the center . 
 Farther inland , Arlene turned to the west @-@ southwest along the building ridge . The storm decreased in strength upon doing so ; its mid- and low @-@ level circulations became increasingly decoupled , with the latter turning elongated and ill @-@ defined . Early on July 1 , the NHC downgraded Arlene to a tropical depression , and the cyclone dissipated over the high terrain of the Sierra Madre Mountains shortly thereafter . Arlene 's remnants continued to produce heavy precipitation over central Mexico , and with high air pressures offshore a tight pressure gradient generated a strong easterly breeze along the country 's Pacific coastlines .

 Due to the threat of heavy rainfall from Arlene 's precursor , authorities issued a green alert in Honduras for 13 departments on the afternoon of June 24 , which remained in effect for 72 hours . In El Salvador , the departments of La Unión , <unk> , and <unk> were put under green alerts on June 26 after rains persisted over the region . Across the Yucatán Peninsula , officials and emergency workers braced for heavy rains as the system developed . Marine and fishing operations were suspended , while schools in Benito Juárez were closed on June 28 . 
 In response to Arlene 's formation , the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for coastal areas from Barra de Nautla northward to Bahia Algodones on June 29 . Later that day , a hurricane watch was put into effect for the area extending from Tuxpan to La Cruz , after the storm showed signs of strengthening . They were both extended shortly after , with the watch then reaching to Barra de Nautla and the warning further southward to Palma Sola , though the latter was simultaneously discontinued for areas to the north of La Pesca . Prior to landfall , the Mexican Social Security Institute ( <unk> ) activated a contingency plan for risk zones in the states of Veracruz and Tamaulipas . Emergency crews and medical teams were subsequently dispatched to the area in order to supply medical care to possible victims and manage power plant water pumps in case of flooding . An alert was declared for Pemex — a major oil company within the storm 's projected path — in consideration of possible impact to refineries and other facilities . 
 Over 50 temporary shelters were made available in flood @-@ prone areas across various municipalities in Veracruz . Authorities in Tamaulipas prepared five shelters and mobilized of 10 emergency teams to evacuate up to 20 @,@ 000 people in anticipation of adverse weather conditions . In Hidalgo , 250 shelters were opened and emergency workers were dispatched as a safety measure . At the risk of flash flooding , public storm shelters were made available in parts of Oaxaca .

 Cento <unk> de laudibus Christi ( Latin : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> lau ̯ <unk> <unk> ] ; A Virgilian Cento Concerning the Glory of Christ ) , also known as De laudibus Christi and Cento <unk> , is the title of a fourth century AD poem of the Roman Empire . It was arranged by Faltonia Betitia Proba c . AD 350 – 360 following the author 's conversion to Christianity . 
 A cento is a poetical work wholly composed of verses or passages taken from other authors , disposed in a new form or order . <unk> verses extracted from the works of Virgil , one of the greatest poets of Latin literature , Proba 's poem details several stories from the Old and New Testament of the Christian Bible , with the crux of the work focusing on the story of Jesus Christ . 
 The impetus for its creation is unknown , although several hypotheses have been put forward , namely that Proba was trying to circumvent a law put in place by the Roman Emperor Julian that forbade Christians from teaching classical Greek and Latin literature which they themselves did not believe in , or that Proba was responding to and rebutting the rather unflattering and demonizing descriptions of Jesus put forth by Julian in his works Caesares and Contra <unk> . The work was circulated heavily , although it was deemed apocryphal by Pope Gelasius I. Furthermore , many scholars believe that St. Jerome disliked the work . However , the likes of Isidore of Seville , Petrarch , and Giovanni Boccaccio praised Proba . In the 19th and 20th centuries , the work was criticized for being of poor quality , but recently , scholars have taken a renewed interest in it . 
 = = Origin and style = = 
 Faltonia Betitia Proba , the cento 's author , was born around AD 322 . Proba was married to Clodius <unk> <unk> , who was a prefect of Rome in AD 351 . Proba was a noted poet , and her first work ( which is now lost ) was called the Constantini bellum <unk> <unk> ; this poem dealt with the war between Roman Emperor Constantius II and the usurper Magnentius . At some point in her life , Proba converted from paganism to Christianity . De laudibus Christi , was written following her conversion , probably sometime <unk> 350 – 360 , and was an attempt by the poet to “ turn away from battle and slayings in order to write holy things . ” 
 The majority of the work takes the form of a Virgilian cento , or a patchwork of verses extracted from several works of the Roman poet Virgil ( although the work 's <unk> and invocation section is composed of several original lines of Latin , in addition to lines borrowed from or alluding to Virgil , the Silver Age poet Lucan , and the 4th century poet <unk> ) . This creative choice on the part of Proba seems to have been made for two reasons . First , Virgil was an extremely influential poet , having been commissioned by the first Roman emperor Caesar Augustus to write the epic poem the Aeneid . Virgil ’ s influence was felt well in to late antiquity , and was imitated by others , such as <unk> and Prudentius . The respect that was given to Virgil eventually manifested in the form of the aforementioned <unk> , which reached their acme in the fourth century AD . Second , Virgil was often appropriated by Christian authors , due to a popular interpretation of his fourth Eclogue , which many believed to be a prophecy concerning the birth of Jesus . 
 = = Contents = = 
 The cento 's 694 lines are divided into a <unk> with invocation ( lines 1 – 55 ) , episodes from the Old Testament ( Genesis , lines 56 – 318 ; Exodus , lines 319 – 332 ) , episodes from the New Testament ( The Gospels , lines 333 – 686 ) , and an epilogue ( lines 687 – 694 ) . At the beginning of the poem , Proba references her earlier poetry , before rejecting it in the name of Christ . She then describes herself as a prophet , calls upon both God and the Holy Spirit ( scorning the help of the Muses ) , and announces her intentions to record the story of Jesus . At the conclusion of the poem 's invocation , Proba states her poem 's main purpose : to " tell how Virgil sang the offices of Christ . " 
 The Old Testament episodes concern the creation of the world , the Fall of Man , the Great Flood , and the Exodus out of Egypt . Proba 's presentation of Creation — which is largely based on rewordings of Virgil 's Georgics — <unk> what is found in Genesis to more closely align the biblical account with then @-@ contemporary Greco @-@ Roman beliefs concerning the origin of the world . Consequently , " some stages of creation are abbreviated while others are amplified or even transposed " to " avoid repetitions and contradictory elements " , such as the double creation of man ( cf . Genesis 1 : 25 – 27 and Genesis 2 : 18 – 19 ) . During the presentation of the events leading to the Fall of Man , Eve 's actions are largely based around the story of Dido , ( cf . Book IV , Aen . ) . The Serpent is described using lines describing Laocoön 's death ( cf . Book II , Aen . ) , as well as the snake sent by the fury Alecto to enrage Amata ( cf . Book VII , Aen . ) To describe human life after the Fall , Proba makes heavy use of the first two books of the Georgics , specifically the sections that discuss the Iron Age of Man ; in this way , Proba is able to connect the Greco @-@ Roman concept of the " Ages of Man " with the Christian concept of the " Fall of Man " . 
 Directly after the Old Testament stories , Proba once again appeals to God , before discussing the birth of Jesus . The following New Testament episodes then deal with the life of Jesus , his crucifixion , and the coming of the Holy Spirit . While Jesus is often described using language befitting a hero ( see below ) , Mary is described using lines that originally related to Venus and Dido . Curiously , Joseph is omitted entirely . Furthermore , Mary 's role has been interpreted by many scholars as either Proba 's representing : Mary alone as a " heroic protagonist " , or conversely as a character lacking any female attributes who is thus " impersonal " . The Sermon on the Mount is notable in that it begins by borrowing the Sibyl of Cumae 's description of punishment for the unrighteous ( cf . Book VI , Aen . ) . This has led some scholars to contend that this portion of De laudibus Christi is the first account of Hell in Christian poetry . Christ 's deeds are telescoped down to three events : Jesus calming the sea , walking on water , and calling his first disciples . Proba conveys the <unk> by using , most notably , several lines describing Hadean punishment ( cf . Book VI , Aen . ) , among others . Following Christ 's death , Proba uses various lines that reference the erotic love between Dido and Aeneas , which are transformed to signify " the sacred love of Christ and his followers . " After Christ is resurrected , he addresses his followers , describing the world to come via the prophecy delivered by Celaeno and the Oracle of Delos ( cf . Book III , Aen . ) . Finally , the ascension , is represented using language that originally described Mercury . 
 Due to the heavy borrowing from Virgil , Proba 's Christ is very similar to the Virgilian epic hero , in that he is : seeking a goal that is greater than merely his human happiness , initiating a realm in which there would exist " dominion without end " , and projecting an aura of divinity . Proba 's entire purpose , argue Clark and Hatch , was therefore to " imbue the Christ with heroic virtues " akin to the Virgilian hero . She does this in three major ways . First , Proba physically describes Jesus as being remarkably beautiful , as well as having " a magnificent and commanding presence " similar to Aeneas . Second , Proba recasts the entire crucifixion episode so that Jesus does not go meekly to his death , but rather lashes out angrily at his persecutors . Proba 's reconfiguration of Jesus 's crucifixion is therefore more in line with Aeneas ' " vengeful action " against Turnus at the end of book twelve of the Aeneid . Finally , Proba transfers unto Jesus parts of the various prophecies scattered throughout the Aeneid that detail the future glory of Aeneas and Rome , recasting these oracular episodes in a Christian light . 
 = = Proba 's motivation = = 
 R. P. H. Green argues that Proba ’ s work was a reaction to Roman Emperor Julian ’ s law that forbade Christian from teaching classical Greek and Latin mythological literature in which they themselves did not believe . Proba ’ s goal , Green argues , was to present “ Vergil without [ pagan ] gods , and [ thus ] a Vergil no longer vulnerable to Christian criticism . ” In this way , a Christian teacher could use this text to discuss Virgil without compromising their moral integrity . Another related hypothesis later emerged , put forth by scholar Aurelio <unk> , which suggested that Proba had created the cento in order to teach her children stories from the Bible . However , there is no direct evidence implying that the work was created by Proba to be a teaching tool . 
 Clark and Hatch postulate that the distinctly Virgilian nature of Jesus in the cento could very well have been Proba 's attempt at responding to and rebutting the rather unflattering and demonizing descriptions of Jesus put forth by Julian in his works Caesares and Contra <unk> . Clark and Hatch , however , concede that while the hypothesis is intriguing , it is largely unfalsifiable due to lack of information about Proba , the date of the cento 's creation , and her intentions . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Around the time of its creation , Proba ’ s cento was immensely popular ; it is attested not only in manuscript records , but also the records of claustral libraries . The work was also heavily used in schools alongside St. Augustine ’ s De Doctrina Christiana ( with Proba ’ s work often eclipsing Augustine ’ s in popularity ) . <unk> <unk> et al. argue that the work was so popular because of its accessible Virgilian style , and because Proba presented herself as “ meek ” female , which appealed to the “ misogynistic views of the general public ” . 
 The work did have its early detractors . It is believed by many that Jerome criticized this work , for in a letter written from Bethlehem to Paulinus of Nola in which he criticized Virgilian <unk> , he warned against following an " old chatterbox " ( garrula anus ) , and those who think of calling " the <unk> Maro [ i.e. Virgil ] a Christian " ( non [ ... ] <unk> sine Christo <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . According to historian James Westfall Thompson , Jerome “ strongly inveighed against this method of destroying the sense of a pagan author [ and ] his love of the classics and his Christian piety were alike offended . ” Another critic of the poem was Pope Gelasius I ( 492 – 496 ) , who declared the De laudibus Christi apocryphal , and he added it to his decretal " Of books to be received and not to be received " . This meant that while the poem was not considered heretical , it was forbidden for it to be read in public . 
 Despite these criticisms , Roman Emperor Arcadius ( AD 395 – 408 ) received a copy of the poem , and his version contains a fifteen line dedication noting that Proba 's work is " Maro changed for the better in a sacred meaning ” ( <unk> <unk> in <unk> divino [ ... ] sensu ) . It was also presented to Aelia Eudocia , the wife of Emperor Theodosius II ( AD 408 – 450 ) . During Late Antiquity , Archbishop Isidore of Seville ( AD 560 – 636 ) wrote highly of Proba , calling her the “ only woman among the men of the church ” ( Proba [ ... ] <unk> inter <unk> <unk> [ ... ] <unk> sola ) , and while he argued that the work was not worth much praise , her ingenuity in regards to its creation indeed was ( Cuius quidem non <unk> <unk> sed laudamus ingenium ) . In the Middle Ages , Proba and her work would go on to be praised as examples of <unk> . Petrarch implicitly referenced De laudibus Christi in a letter discussing female geniuses , and in AD 1374 Giovanni Boccaccio included Proba on his list of famous women . In AD 1472 , the poem was first printed ; this means that Faltonia Betitia Proba may very well have been the first female author to have her work duplicated via the printing press . 
 Scholarship in the 19th and 20th centuries was much more critical of the work , with William Smith 's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology referring to the poem as " trash " worthy of " no praise " . It was also used by classicists and philologists of the era as an example of " late antiquity 's ' poverty of ideas ' " . Despite the disgust directed at the work during the 19th and 20th centuries , scholars have recently begun to re @-@ examine the work in a more positive light , seeing it as an interesting piece of literature worthy of study . Exemplifying such an opinion , Cullhed considers the work " of considerable historical and cultural importance [ for ] it belongs to the small number of ancient texts with a female author and stands out as one of our earliest extant Christian Latin poems . " 
 = = Authorship controversy = = 
 The work is traditionally ascribed to Faltonia Betitia Proba , based largely on the assertion of Isidore , who notes that the work was the product of a woman named Proba who was the wife of a man named Adelphus ( Proba , <unk> Adelphi , <unk> ex <unk> [ ... ] <unk> ) . However , classicist and medievalist Danuta Shanzer argued that the work was not actually created by Faltonia Betitia Proba , but rather her granddaughter , Anicia Faltonia Proba , a noblewoman who lived at the end of the fourth and beginning of the fifth centuries AD . Shanzer and others who agree with her developed several arguments as to why they believed that the work was not Faltonia Betitia Proba ’ s . First , they argue that lines 13 – 17 of De laudibus Christi bear a resemblance to lines 20 – 24 of the later poem Carmen contra paganos which is purported to have been penned after Faltonia Betitia Proba 's death . Second , they believe that the poem must have been written after AD 387 , because it alludes to a debate about the date of Easter , which only took place in 387 . Third , they see Jerome ’ s allusion to the poem ( discussed above ) as a reference to a living individual ( i.e. Anicia Proba ) . Fourth , they contend that Faltonia Betitia Proba had actually died during the war between Magnentius and <unk> , a war alluded to in the invocation of De laudibus Christi . Fifth and finally , they argue that Anicia Proba must have written the work since the author is referred to as “ mother of the <unk> ” in a later manuscript , as well as the “ eminent Roman Mistress ” in another ; these are titles only Anicia Proba would have received . 
 Sigrid Cullhed , in her 2015 book Proba the Prophet , collects various counterpoints to Shanzer et al . ’ s claims . First , Cullhed disputes the first argument , noting that “ there are no ‘ grounds for determining priority ’ ” of the lines . In regards to the second point , Cullhed notes that the supposed reference to the AD 387 debate about Easter could have easily referred to an earlier dispute . Countering the third point , Cullhed notes out that many other scholars feel that Jerome would have never insulted Anicia Proba since he praised her as “ the richest , noblest and most powerful woman in Rome ” in another letter ( this opinion is reiterated by Green ) . In regards to the fourth argument , Cullhed notes that Faltonia Betitia Proba ’ s supposed death in AD 351 may very well be unfounded . Opposing the fifth point , Cullhed argues that the titles used to refer to the author could have been inserted after the fact , sometime in the Middle Ages . Finally , Cullhed brings forth new evidence , arguing that if Anicia Proba had penned De laudibus Christi , it is likely that the Latin poet Claudian would have mentioned her poetic skills in his panegyric that celebrated the joint consulship of Anicia Proba 's two sons , <unk> Hermogenianus <unk> and <unk> <unk> in AD 395 . Cullhed summarizes her argument by saying : “ The evidence for discrediting Isidore ’ s attribution [ of Faltonia Betitia Proba as the cento 's author ] is not sufficient , and so , I will assume that the cento was written in the mid @-@ fourth century by Faltonia Betitia Proba . ” Likewise , Karl <unk> argues that scholars should accept the testimony of Isidore , who clearly attributes De laudibus Christi to Faltonia Betitia Proba . The general consensus of classicists and scholars today is that De laudibus Christi was indeed arranged by Faltonia Betitia Proba . 
 = Zhang Heng = 
 Zhang Heng ( Chinese : <unk> ; AD 78 – 139 ) , formerly romanized as Chang Heng , was a Han Chinese polymath from Nanyang who lived during the Han dynasty . Educated in the capital cities of Luoyang and Chang 'an , he achieved success as an astronomer , mathematician , scientist , engineer , inventor , geographer , cartographer , artist , poet , statesman , and literary scholar . 
 Zhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang . Eventually , he became Chief Astronomer , Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages , and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court . His uncompromising stance on historical and calendrical issues led to his becoming a controversial figure , preventing him from rising to the status of Grand Historian . His political rivalry with the palace eunuchs during the reign of Emperor Shun ( r . 125 – 144 ) led to his decision to retire from the central court to serve as an administrator of Hejian in Hebei . Zhang returned home to Nanyang for a short time , before being recalled to serve in the capital once more in 138 . He died there a year later , in 139 . 
 Zhang applied his extensive knowledge of mechanics and gears in several of his inventions . He invented the world 's first water @-@ powered armillary sphere to assist astronomical observation ; improved the inflow water clock by adding another tank ; and invented the world 's first seismometer , which discerned the cardinal direction of an earthquake 500 km ( 310 mi ) away . He improved previous Chinese calculations for pi . In addition to documenting about 2 @,@ 500 stars in his extensive star catalog , Zhang also posited theories about the Moon and its relationship to the Sun : specifically , he discussed the Moon 's sphericity , its illumination by reflected sunlight on one side and the hidden nature of the other , and the nature of solar and lunar eclipses . His fu ( rhapsody ) and shi poetry were renowned in his time and studied and analyzed by later Chinese writers . Zhang received many posthumous honors for his scholarship and ingenuity ; some modern scholars have compared his work in astronomy to that of the Greco @-@ Roman Ptolemy ( AD 86 – 161 ) .

 Born in the town of Xi 'e in Nanyang Commandery ( north of the modern Nanyang City in Henan province ) , Zhang Heng came from a distinguished but not very affluent family . His grandfather Zhang Kan had been governor of a commandery and one of the leaders who supported the restoration of the Han by Emperor Guangwu ( r . 25 – 57 ) , following the death of the usurping Wang Mang of the Xin ( AD 9 – 23 ) . At age ten , Zhang 's father died , leaving him in the care of his mother and grandmother . An accomplished writer in his youth , Zhang left home in the year 95 to pursue his studies in the capitals of Chang 'an and Luoyang . While traveling to Luoyang , Zhang passed by a hot spring near Mount Li and dedicated one of his earliest fu poems to it . This work , entitled " Fu on the Hot Springs " ( <unk> fù <unk> ) , describes the throngs of people attending the hot springs , which later became famous as the " Huaqing Hot Springs " , a favorite retreat of imperial concubine Yang <unk> during the Tang dynasty . After studying for some years at Luoyang 's <unk> , he was well @-@ versed in the classics and friends with several notable persons , including the mathematician and calligrapher Cui Yuan ( 78 – 143 ) , the official and philosophical commentator Ma Rong ( 79 – 166 ) , and the philosopher Wang Fu ( 78 – 163 ) . Government authorities offered Zhang appointments to several offices , including a position as one of the Imperial Secretaries , yet he acted modestly and declined . At age twenty @-@ three , he returned home with the title " Officer of Merit in Nanyang " , serving as the master of documents under the administration of Governor Bao De ( in office from 103 – 111 ) . As he was charged with composing inscriptions and dirges for the governor , he gained experience in writing official documents . As Officer of Merit in the commandery , he was also responsible for local appointments to office and recommendations to the capital of nominees for higher office . He spent much of his time composing rhapsodies on the capital cities . When Bao De was recalled to the capital in 111 to serve as a minister of finance , Zhang continued his literary work at home in Xi 'e . Zhang Heng began his studies in astronomy at the age of thirty and began publishing his works on astronomy and mathematics .

 In 112 , Zhang was summoned to the court of Emperor An ( r . 106 – 125 ) , who had heard of his expertise in mathematics . When he was nominated to serve at the capital , Zhang was escorted by carriage — a symbol of his official status — to Luoyang , where he became a court gentleman working for the Imperial Secretariat . He was promoted to Chief Astronomer for the court , serving his first term from 115 – 120 under Emperor An and his second under the succeeding emperor from 126 – 132 . As Chief Astronomer , Zhang was a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies , one of Nine Ministers ranked just below the Three Excellencies . In addition to recording heavenly observations and portents , preparing the calendar , and reporting which days were auspicious and which ill @-@ omened , Zhang was also in charge of an advanced literacy test for all candidates to the Imperial Secretariat and the Censorate , both of whose members were required to know at least 9 @,@ 000 characters and all major writing styles . Under Emperor An , Zhang also served as Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages under the Ministry of Guards , in charge of receiving memorials to the throne ( formal essays on policy and administration ) as well as nominees for official appointments . 
 When the government official Dan Song proposed the Chinese calendar should be reformed in 123 to adopt certain apocryphal teachings , Zhang opposed the idea . He considered the teachings to be of questionable stature and believed they could introduce errors . Others shared Zhang 's opinion and the calendar was not altered , yet Zhang 's proposal that apocryphal writings should be banned was rejected . The officials Liu Zhen and Liu <unk> , members of a committee to compile the dynastic history Dongguan <unk> ( <unk> ) , sought permission from the court to consult Zhang Heng . However , Zhang was barred from assisting the committee due to his controversial views on apocrypha and his objection to the relegation of Emperor Gengshi 's ( r . 23 – 25 ) role in the restoration of the Han Dynasty as lesser than Emperor Guangwu 's . Liu Zhen and Liu <unk> were Zhang 's only historian allies at court , and after their deaths Zhang had no further opportunities for promotion to the prestigious post of court historian . 
 Despite this setback in his official career , Zhang was reappointed as Chief Astronomer in 126 after Emperor Shun of Han ( r . 125 – 144 ) ascended to the throne . His intensive astronomical work was rewarded only with the rank and salary of 600 bushels , or shi , of grain ( mostly commuted to coin cash or bolts of silk ) . To place this number in context , in a hierarchy of twenty official ranks , the lowest @-@ paid official earned the rank and salary of 100 bushels and the highest @-@ paid official earned 10 @,@ 000 bushels during the Han . The 600 @-@ bushel rank was the lowest the emperor could directly appoint to a central government position ; any official of lower status was overseen by central or provincial officials of high rank . 
 In 132 , Zhang introduced an intricate seismometer to the court , which he claimed could detect the precise cardinal direction of a distant earthquake . On one occasion his device indicated that an earthquake had occurred in the northwest . As there was no perceivable tremor felt in the capital his political enemies were briefly able to relish the failure of his device , until a messenger arrived shortly afterwards to report that an earthquake had occurred about 400 km ( 248 mi ) to 500 km ( 310 mi ) northwest of Luoyang in Gansu province . 
 A year after Zhang presented his seismometer to the court , officials and candidates were asked to provide comments about a series of recent earthquakes which could be interpreted as signs of displeasure from Heaven . The ancient Chinese viewed natural calamities as cosmological punishments for misdeeds that were perpetrated by the Chinese ruler or his subordinates on earth . In Zhang 's memorial discussing the reasons behind these natural disasters , he criticized the new recruitment system of Zuo Xiong which fixed the age of eligible candidates for the title " Filial and Incorrupt " at age forty . The new system also transferred the power of the candidates ' assessment to the Three Excellencies rather than the Generals of the Household , who by tradition oversaw the affairs of court gentlemen . Although Zhang 's memorial was rejected , his status was significantly elevated soon after to Palace Attendant , a position he used to influence the decisions of Emperor Shun . With this prestigious new position , Zhang earned a salary of 2 @,@ 000 bushels and had the right to escort the emperor . 
 As Palace Attendant to Emperor Shun , Zhang Heng attempted to convince him that the court eunuchs represented a threat to the imperial court . Zhang pointed to specific examples of past court intrigues involving eunuchs , and convinced Shun that he should assume greater authority and limit their influence . The eunuchs attempted to slander Zhang , who responded with a fu rhapsody called " Fu on <unk> the Mystery " , which vents his frustration . Rafe de Crespigny states that Zhang 's rhapsody used imagery similar to Qu Yuan 's ( 340 – 278 BC ) poem " Li Sao " and focused on whether or not good men should flee the corrupted world or remain virtuous within it . 
 = = Literature and poetry = = 
 While working for the central court , Zhang Heng had access to a variety of written materials located in the Archives of the Eastern Pavilion . Zhang read many of the great works of history in his day and claimed he had found ten instances where the Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian ( 145 – 90 BC ) and the Book of Han by Ban Gu ( AD 32 – 92 ) differed from other ancient texts that were available to him . His account was preserved and recorded in the 5th century text of the Book of Later Han by Fan Ye ( 398 – 445 ) . His rhapsodies and other literary works displayed a deep knowledge of classic texts , Chinese philosophy , and histories . He also compiled a commentary on the <unk> ( <unk> , " Great Mystery " ) by the Daoist author Yang Xiong ( 53 BC – AD 18 ) . 
 Xiao Tong ( 501 – 531 ) , a crown prince of the Liang Dynasty ( 502 – 557 ) , immortalized several of Zhang 's works in his literary anthology , Selections of Refined Literature ( Wen <unk> <unk> ) . Zhang 's rhapsodies ( <unk> , fu ) include " Western Metropolis Rhapsody " ( <unk> ) , " Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody " ( <unk> ) , " Southern Capital Rhapsody " ( <unk> ) , " Rhapsody on Contemplating the Mystery " ( <unk> ) , and " Rhapsody on Returning to the Fields " ( <unk> ) . The latter fuses Daoist ideas with Confucianism and was a precursor to later Chinese metaphysical nature poetry , according to Liu Wu @-@ chi . A set of four short lyric poems ( shi <unk> ) entitled " Lyric Poems on Four Sorrows " ( <unk> ) , is also included with Zhang 's preface . This set constitutes some of the earliest <unk> shi Chinese poetry written . While still in Luoyang , Zhang became inspired to write his " Western Metropolis Rhapsody " and " Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody " , which were based on the " Rhapsody on the Two Capitals " by the historian Ban Gu . Zhang 's work was similar to Ban 's , although the latter fully praised the contemporaneous Eastern Han regime while Zhang provided a warning that it could suffer the same fate as the Western Han if it too declined into a state of decadence and moral depravity . These two works satirized and criticized what he saw as the excessive luxury of the upper classes . Zhang 's " Southern Capital Rhapsody " commemorated his home city of Nanyang , home of the restorer of the Han Dynasty , Guangwu . 
 In Zhang Heng 's poem " Four Sorrows " , he laments that he is unable to woo a beautiful woman due to the impediment of mountains , snows and rivers . Rafe de Crespigny , Tong Xiao , and David R. <unk> claim that Zhang wrote this as an innuendo hinting at his inability to keep in contact with the emperor , hindered by unworthy rivals and petty men . This poem is one of the first in China to have seven words per line . His " Four Sorrows " reads : 
 In another poem of his called " Stabilizing the Passions " ( <unk> ) — preserved in a Tang Dynasty ( 618 – 907 ) encyclopedia , but referred to earlier by Tao Qian ( 365 – 427 ) in praise of Zhang 's lyrical minimalism — Zhang displays his admiration for an attractive and exemplary woman . This simpler type of fu poem influenced later works by the prominent official and scholar Cai Yong ( 132 – 192 ) . Zhang wrote : 
 Zhang 's long lyrical poems also revealed a great amount of information on urban layout and basic geography . His rhapsody " Sir Based @-@ On @-@ Nothing " provides details on terrain , palaces , hunting parks , markets , and prominent buildings of Chang 'an , the Western Han capital . Exemplifying his attention to detail , his rhapsody on Nanyang described gardens filled with spring garlic , summer bamboo shoots , autumn leeks , winter rape @-@ turnips , <unk> , <unk> , and purple ginger . Zhang Heng 's writing confirms the size of the imperial hunting park in the suburbs of Chang 'an , as his estimate for the circumference of the park 's encircling wall agrees with the historian Ban Gu 's estimate of roughly 400 li ( one li in Han times was equal to 415 @.@ 8 m , or 1 @,@ 364 ft , making the circumference of the park wall 166 @,@ 320 m , or 545 @,@ 600 ft ) . Along with Sima Xiangru ( 179 – 117 BC ) , Zhang listed a variety of animals and hunting game inhabiting the park , which were divided in the northern and southern portions of the park according to where the animals had originally came from : northern or southern China . Somewhat similar to the description of Sima Xiangru , Zhang described the Western Han emperors and their entourage enjoying boat outings , water plays , fishing , and displays of archery targeting birds and other animals with stringed arrows from the tops of tall towers along Chang 'an 's Kunming Lake . The focus of Zhang 's writing on specific places and their terrain , society , people , and their customs could also be seen as early attempts of ethnographic categorization . In his poem " Xijing fu " , Zhang shows that he was aware of the new foreign religion of Buddhism , introduced via the Silk Road , as well as the legend of the birth of Buddha with the vision of the white elephant bringing about conception . In his " Western Metropolis Rhapsody " ( <unk> ) , Zhang described court entertainments such as <unk> ( <unk> ) , a form of theatrical wrestling accompanied by music in which participants butted heads with bull horn masks . 
 With his " Responding to Criticism " ( Ying jian <unk> ) , a work modeled on Yang Xiong 's " Justification Against Ridicule " , Zhang was an early writer and proponent of the Chinese literary genre <unk> , or hypothetical discourse . Authors of this genre created a written dialogue between themselves and an imaginary person ( or a real person of their entourage or association ) ; the latter poses questions to the author on how to lead a successful life . He also used it as a means to criticize himself for failing to obtain high office , but coming to the conclusion that the true gentleman displays virtue instead of greed for power . In this work , Dominik Declercq asserts that the person urging Zhang to advance his career in a time of government corruption most likely represented the eunuchs or Empress Liang 's ( 116 – 150 ) powerful relatives in the Liang clan . Declercq states that these two groups would have been " anxious to know whether this famous scholar could be lured over to their side " , but Zhang flatly rejected such an alignment by declaring in this politically charged piece of literature that his gentlemanly quest for virtue trumped any desire of his for power . 
 Zhang wrote about the various love affairs of emperors dissatisfied with the imperial harem , going out into the city incognito to seek out prostitutes and sing @-@ song girls . This was seen as a general criticism of the Eastern Han emperors and their imperial favorites , <unk> in the criticism of earlier Western Han emperors . Besides criticizing the Western Han emperors for lavish decadence , Zhang also pointed out that their behavior and ceremonies did not properly conform with the Chinese cyclical beliefs in yin and yang . In a poem criticizing the previous Western Han Dynasty , Zhang wrote :

 For centuries the Chinese approximated pi as 3 ; Liu Xin ( d . AD 23 ) made the first known Chinese attempt at a more accurate calculation of 3 @.@ 1457 , but there is no record detailing the method he used to obtain this figure . In his work around 130 , Zhang Heng compared the celestial circle to the diameter of the earth , proportioning the former as 736 and the latter as 232 , thus calculating pi as 3 @.@ 1724 . In Zhang 's day , the ratio 4 : 3 was given for the area of a square to the area of its inscribed circle and the volume of a cube and volume of the inscribed sphere should also be 42 : 32 . In formula , with D as diameter and V as volume , D3 : V = 16 : 9 or V = <formula> D3 ; Zhang realized that the value for diameter in this formula was inaccurate , noting the discrepancy as the value taken for the ratio . Zhang then attempted to remedy this by amending the formula with an additional <formula> D3 , hence V 
 = <formula> D3 + <formula> D3 = 
 <formula> D3 . With the ratio of the volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8 : 5 , the implied ratio of the area of the square to the circle is √ 8 : √ 5 . From this formula , Zhang calculated pi as the square root of 10 ( or approximately 3 @.@ 162 ) . Zhang also calculated pi as <formula> = 3 @.@ 1466 in his book Ling Xian ( 靈憲 ) . In the 3rd century , Liu Hui made the calculation more accurate with his π algorithm , which allowed him to obtain the value 3 @.@ 14159 . Later , Zu Chongzhi ( 429 – 500 ) approximated pi as <formula> or 3 @.@ <unk> , the most accurate calculation for pi the ancient Chinese would achieve . 
 In his publication of AD 120 called The Spiritual Constitution of the Universe ( 靈憲 , Ling Xian , lit . " Sublime Model " ) , Zhang Heng theorized that the universe was like an egg " as round as a crossbow pellet " with the stars on the shell and the Earth as the central yolk . This universe theory is congruent with the geocentric model as opposed to the heliocentric model . Although the ancient Warring States ( 403 – 221 BC ) Chinese astronomers Shi Shen and Gan De had compiled China 's first star catalogue in the 4th century BC , Zhang nonetheless catalogued 2 @,@ 500 stars which he placed in a " brightly shining " category ( the Chinese estimated the total to be 14 @,@ 000 ) , and he recognized 124 constellations . In comparison , this star catalogue featured many more stars than the 850 documented by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus ( c . 190 – <unk> BC ) in his catalogue , and more than Ptolemy ( AD 83 – 161 ) , who catalogued over 1 @,@ 000 . Zhang supported the " radiating influence " theory to explain solar and lunar eclipses , a theory which was opposed by Wang Chong ( AD 27 – 97 ) . In the Ling Xian , Zhang wrote : 
 The Sun is like fire and the Moon like water . The fire gives out light and the water reflects it . Thus the moon 's brightness is produced from the radiance of the Sun , and the Moon 's darkness is due to ( the light of ) the sun being obstructed . The side which faces the Sun is fully lit , and the side which is away from it is dark . The planets ( as well as the Moon ) have the nature of water and reflect light . The light pouring forth from the Sun does not always reach the moon owing to the obstruction of the earth itself — this is called ' an @-@ <unk> ' , a lunar eclipse . When ( a similar effect ) happens with a planet ( we call it ) an occultation ; when the Moon passes across ( the Sun 's path ) then there is a solar eclipse . 
 Zhang Heng viewed these astronomical phenomena in supernatural terms as well . The signs of comets , eclipses , and movements of heavenly bodies could all be interpreted by him as heavenly guides on how to conduct affairs of state . Contemporary writers also wrote about eclipses and the sphericity of heavenly bodies . The music theorist and mathematician Jing Fang ( 78 – 37 BC ) wrote about the spherical shape of the Sun and Moon while discussing eclipses : 
 The Moon and the planets are Yin ; they have shape but no light . This they receive only when the Sun illuminates them . The former masters regarded the Sun as round like a crossbow bullet , and they thought the Moon had the nature of a mirror . Some of them recognized the Moon as a ball too . Those parts of the Moon which the Sun illuminates look bright , those parts which it does not , remain dark . 
 The theory posited by Zhang and Jing was supported by later pre @-@ modern scientists such as Shen Kuo ( 1031 – 1095 ) , who expanded on the reasoning of why the Sun and Moon were spherical . 
 = = = Extra tank for inflow clepsydra = = = 
 The outflow clepsydra was a timekeeping device used in China as long ago as the Shang Dynasty ( c . 1600 – c . 1050 BC ) , and certainly by the Zhou Dynasty ( 1122 – 256 BC ) . The inflow clepsydra with an indicator rod on a float had been known in China since the beginning of the Han Dynasty in 202 BC and had replaced the outflow type . The Han Chinese noted the problem with the falling pressure head in the reservoir , which slowed the timekeeping of the device as the inflow vessel was filled . Zhang Heng was the first to address this problem , indicated in his writings from 117 , by adding an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel . Zhang also mounted two statuettes of a Chinese immortal and a heavenly guard on the top of the inflow clepsydra , the two of which would guide the indicator rod with their left hand and point out the graduations with their right . Joseph Needham states that this was perhaps the ancestor of all clock jacks that would later sound the hours found in mechanical clocks by the 8th century , but he notes that these figures did not actually move like clock jack figurines or sound the hours . Many additional compensation tanks were added to later <unk> in the tradition of Zhang Heng . In 610 the Sui Dynasty ( 581 – 618 ) engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai crafted an unequal @-@ armed steelyard balance able to make seasonal adjustments in the pressure head of the compensating tank , so that it could control the rate of water flow for different lengths of day and night during the year . Zhang mentioned a " jade dragon 's neck " , which in later times meant a siphon . He wrote of the floats and indicator @-@ rods of the inflow clepsydra as follows : 
 Bronze vessels are made and placed one above the other at different levels ; they are filled with pure water . Each has at the bottom a small opening in the form of a ' jade dragon 's neck ' . The water dripping ( from above ) enters two inflow receivers ( alternately ) , the left one being for the night and the right one for the day . On the covers of each ( inflow receiver ) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze ; the left ( night ) one is an immortal and the right ( day ) one is a policeman . These figures guide the indicator @-@ rod ( lit. arrow ) with their left hands , and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands , thus giving the time . 
 = = = Water @-@ powered armillary sphere = = = 
 Zhang Heng is the first person known to have applied hydraulic motive power ( i.e. by employing a waterwheel and clepsydra ) to rotate an armillary sphere , an astronomical instrument representing the celestial sphere . The Greek astronomer Eratosthenes ( 276 – 194 BC ) invented the first armillary sphere in 255 BC . The Chinese armillary sphere was fully developed by 52 BC , with the astronomer Geng <unk> 's addition of a permanently fixed equatorial ring . In AD 84 the astronomers Fu An and Jia Kui added the ecliptic ring , and finally Zhang Heng added the horizon and meridian rings . This invention is described and attributed to Zhang in quotations by Hsu Chen and Li Shan , referencing his book Lou Shui Chuan Hun Thien I Chieh ( Apparatus for Rotating an Armillary Sphere by <unk> Water ) . It was likely not an actual book by Zhang , but a chapter from his Hun I or Hun I Thu Chu , written in 117 AD . His water @-@ powered armillary influenced the design of later Chinese water clocks and led to the discovery of the escapement mechanism by the 8th century . The historian Joseph Needham ( 1900 – 1995 ) states : 
 What were the factors leading to the first escapement clock in China ? The chief tradition leading to Yi Xing ( AD 725 ) was of course the succession of ' pre @-@ clocks ' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125 . Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes by means of a water @-@ wheel using clepsydra drip , which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar @-@ axis shaft . Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere , and combining it with the principles of the water @-@ mills and hydraulic trip @-@ hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century . 
 Zhang did not initiate the Chinese tradition of hydraulic engineering , which began during the mid Zhou Dynasty ( c . 6th century BC ) , through the work of engineers such as <unk> Ao and <unk> Bao . Zhang 's contemporary , Du Shi , ( d . AD 38 ) was the first to apply the motive power of waterwheels to operate the bellows of a blast furnace to make pig iron , and the cupola furnace to make cast iron . Zhang provided a valuable description of his water @-@ powered armillary sphere in the treatise of 125 , stating : 
 The equatorial ring goes around the belly of the armillary sphere 91 and 5 / 19 ( degrees ) away from the pole . The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 ( degrees ) with the equator . Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 ( degrees ) and a fraction away from the pole , while at the winter solstice it is 115 ( degrees ) and a fraction away . Hence ( the points ) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes . But now ( it has been recorded that ) the spring equinox is 90 and 1 / 4 ( degrees ) away from the pole , and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1 / 4 ( degrees ) away . The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the ( results obtained by the ) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia ( dynasty ) calendar . 
 Zhang Heng 's water @-@ powered armillary sphere had profound effects on Chinese astronomy and mechanical engineering in later generations . His model and its complex use of gears greatly influenced the water @-@ powered instruments of later astronomers such as Yi Xing ( 683 – 727 ) , Zhang Sixun ( fl . 10th century ) , Su Song ( 1020 – 1101 ) , Guo Shoujing ( 1231 – 1316 ) , and many others . Water @-@ powered armillary spheres in the tradition of Zhang Heng 's were used in the eras of the Three Kingdoms ( 220 – 280 ) and Jin Dynasty ( 265 – 420 ) , yet the design for it was temporarily out of use between 317 and 418 , due to invasions of northern Xiongnu nomads . Zhang Heng 's old instruments were recovered in 418 , when Emperor Wu of Liu Song ( r . 420 – 422 ) captured the ancient capital of Chang 'an . Although still intact , the graduation marks and the representations of the stars , Moon , Sun , and planets were quite worn down by time and rust . In 436 , the emperor ordered Qian <unk> , the Secretary of the Bureau of Astronomy and Calendar , to recreate Zhang 's device , which he managed to do successfully . Qian 's water @-@ powered celestial globe was still in use at the time of the Liang Dynasty ( 502 – 557 ) , and successive models of water @-@ powered armillary spheres were designed in subsequent dynasties . 
 = = = Zhang 's seismograph = = = 
 From the earliest times , the Chinese were concerned with the destructive force of earthquakes . It was recorded in Sima Qian 's Records of the Grand Historian of 91 BC that in 780 BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers . It was not known at the time that earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth 's crust ; instead , the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang , along with the heavens ' displeasure with acts committed ( or the common peoples ' grievances ignored ) by the current ruling dynasty . These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing ( Book of Changes ) , in its fifty @-@ first hexagram . There were other early theories about earthquakes , developed by those such as the ancient Greeks . Anaxagoras ( c . 500 – 428 BC ) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth 's hollows ; Democritus ( c . 460 – 370 BC ) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them ; Anaximenes ( c . 585 – c . 525 BC ) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying ; and Aristotle ( 384 – 322 BC ) believed they were caused by instability of vapor ( pneuma ) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun 's rays . 
 During the Han Dynasty , many learned scholars — including Zhang Heng — believed in the " oracles of the winds " . These oracles of the occult observed the direction , force , and timing of the winds , to speculate about the operation of the cosmos and to predict events on Earth . These ideas influenced Zhang Heng 's views on the cause of earthquakes . Against the grain of earlier theories proposed by his fellow Chinese and contemporary Greeks , Zhang Heng believed that earthquakes were caused by wind and air , writing : 
 The chief cause of earthquake is air , an element naturally swift and shifting from place to place . As long as it is not stirred , but lurks in a vacant space , it <unk> innocently , giving no trouble to objects around it . But any cause coming upon it from without rouses it , or compresses it , and drives it into a narrow space ... and when opportunity of escape is cut off , then ' With deep murmur of the Mountain it roars around the barriers ' , which after long battering it dislodges and tosses on high , growing more fierce the stronger the obstacle with which it has contended . 
 In 132 , Zhang Heng presented to the Han court what many historians consider to be his most impressive invention , the first seismometer . It was named " earthquake weathervane " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , lit. instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth ) , and it was able to roughly determine the direction ( out of eight directions ) where the earthquake came from . According to the Book of Later Han ( compiled by Fan Ye in the 5th century ) , his bronze urn @-@ shaped device , with a swinging pendulum inside , was able to detect the direction of an earthquake hundreds of miles / kilometers away . This was essential for the Han government in sending quick aid and relief to regions devastated by this natural disaster . The Book of Later Han records that , on one occasion , Zhang 's device was triggered , though no observer had felt any seismic disturbance ; several days later a messenger arrived from the west and reported that an earthquake had occurred in Longxi ( modern Gansu Province ) , the same direction that Zhang 's device had indicated , and thus the court was forced to admit the efficacy of the device . 
 To indicate the direction of a distant earthquake , Zhang 's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads ; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad , each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose . His device had eight mobile arms ( for all eight directions ) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery . When tripped , a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head . His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank , a catch device , a pivot on a projection , a sling suspending the pendulum , an attachment for the sling , and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum . Wang Zhenduo ( <unk> ) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device , as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers . 
 Later Chinese of subsequent periods were able to reinvent Zhang 's seismometer . They included the 6th @-@ century mathematician and surveyor Xindu Fang of the Northern Qi Dynasty ( 550 – 577 ) and the astronomer and mathematician Lin Xiaogong of the Sui Dynasty ( 581 – 618 ) . Like Zhang , Xindu Fang and Lin Xiaogong were given imperial patronage for their services in craftsmanship of devices for the court . By the time of the Yuan Dynasty ( 1271 – 1368 ) , it was acknowledged that all devices previously made were preserved , except for that of the seismometer . This was discussed by the scholar Zhou Mi around 1290 , who remarked that the books of Xindu Fang and Lin Xiaogong detailing their seismological devices were no longer to be found . Horwitz , <unk> , and Needham speculate if Tang Dynasty ( 618 – 907 ) era seismographs found their way to contemporary Japan ; according to Needham , " instruments of apparently traditional type there in which a pendulum carries pins projecting in many directions and able to pierce a surrounding paper cylinder , have been described . " 
 Hong @-@ sen Yan states that modern replicas of Zhang 's device have failed to reach the level of accuracy and sensitivity described in Chinese historical records . Wang Zhenduo presented two different models of the seismometer based on the ancient descriptions of Zhang 's device . In his 1936 reconstruction , the central pillar ( du zhu ) of the device was a suspended pendulum acting as a movement sensor , while the central pillar of his second model in 1963 was an inverted pendulum . According to Needham , while working in the Seismological Observatory of Tokyo University in 1939 , <unk> Imamura and Hagiwara made a reconstruction of Zhang 's device . While it was John Milne and Wang Zhenduo who argued early on that Zhang 's " central pillar " was a suspended pendulum , Imamura was the first to propose an inverted model . He argued that transverse shock would have rendered Wang 's immobilization mechanism ineffective , as it would not have prevented further motion that could knock other balls out of their position . On June 13 , 2005 , modern Chinese seismologists announced that they had successfully created a replica of the instrument . 
 Anthony J. Barbieri @-@ Low , a Professor of Early Chinese History at the University of California , Santa Barbara , names Zhang Heng as one of several high @-@ ranking Eastern @-@ Han officials who engaged in crafts that were traditionally reserved for artisans ( gong <unk> ) , such as mechanical engineering . Barbieri @-@ Low speculates that Zhang only designed his seismometer , but did not actually craft the device himself . He asserts that this would most likely have been the job of artisans commissioned by Zhang . He writes : " Zhang Heng was an official of moderately high rank and could not be seen sweating in the foundries with the gong artisans and the government slaves . Most likely , he worked collaboratively with the professional casters and mold makers in the imperial workshops . "

 The Wei ( 220 – 265 ) and Jin Dynasty ( 265 – 420 ) cartographer and official Pei Xiu ( 224 – 271 ) was the first in China to describe in full the geometric grid reference for maps that allowed for precise measurements using a graduated scale , as well as topographical elevation . However , map @-@ making in China had existed since at least the 4th century BC with the Qin state maps found in Gansu in 1986 . <unk> accuracy of the winding courses of rivers and familiarity with scaled distance had been known since the Qin and Han Dynasty , respectively , as evidenced by their existing maps , while the use of a rectangular grid had been known in China since the Han as well . Historian Howard Nelson states that , although the accounts of Zhang Heng 's work in cartography are somewhat vague and sketchy , there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the use of the rectangular grid reference from the maps of Zhang Heng . Rafe de Crespigny asserts that it was Zhang who established the rectangular grid system in Chinese cartography . Needham points out that the title of his book Flying Bird Calendar may have been a mistake , and that the book is more accurately entitled Bird 's Eye Map . Historian Florian C. Reiter notes that Zhang 's narrative " <unk> fu " contains a phrase about applauding the maps and documents of Confucius of the Zhou Dynasty , which Reiter suggests places maps ( tu ) on a same level of importance with documents ( shu ) . It is documented that a physical geography map was first presented by Zhang Heng in 116 AD , called a Ti Hsing Thu . 
 = = = <unk> and south @-@ pointing chariot = = = 
 Zhang Heng is often credited with inventing the first odometer , an achievement also attributed to Archimedes ( c . 287 – 212 BC ) and Heron of Alexandria ( fl . AD 10 – 70 ) . Similar devices were used by the Roman and Han @-@ Chinese empires at about the same period . By the 3rd century , the Chinese had termed the device the ji li gu che , or " li @-@ recording drum carriage " ( the modern measurement of li = 500 m / 1640 ft ) . 
 Ancient Chinese texts describe the mechanical carriage 's functions ; after one li was traversed , a mechanically driven wooden figure struck a drum , and after ten li had been covered , another wooden figure struck a gong or a bell with its mechanically operated arm . However , there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han Dynasty China that centered on the " huang men " — court people ( i.e. eunuchs , palace officials , attendants and familiars , actors , acrobats , etc . ) who followed the musical procession of the royal " drum @-@ chariot " . There is speculation that at some time during the 1st century BC the beating of drums and gongs was mechanically driven by the rotation of the road wheels . This might have actually been the design of <unk> Hong ( c . 110 BC ) , yet by at least 125 the mechanical odometer carriage was already known , as it was depicted in a mural of the Xiao Tang Shan Tomb . 
 The south @-@ pointing chariot was another mechanical device credited to Zhang Heng . It was a non @-@ magnetic compass vehicle in the form of a two @-@ wheeled chariot . Differential gears driven by the chariot 's wheels allowed a wooden figurine ( in the shape of a Chinese state minister ) to constantly point to the south , hence its name . The Song Shu ( c . AD 500 ) records that Zhang Heng re @-@ invented it from a model used in the Zhou Dynasty era , but the violent collapse of the Han Dynasty unfortunately did not allow it to be preserved . Whether Zhang Heng invented it or not , Ma Jun ( 200 – 265 ) succeeded in creating the chariot in the following century .

 Zhang Heng 's mechanical inventions influenced later Chinese inventors such as Yi Xing , Zhang Sixun , Su Song , and Guo Shoujing . Su Song directly named Zhang 's water @-@ powered armillary sphere as the inspiration for his 11th @-@ century clock tower . The cosmic model of nine points of Heaven corresponding with nine regions of earth conceived in the work of the scholar @-@ official Chen <unk> ( 1696 – 1771 ) followed in the tradition of Zhang 's book Spiritual Constitution of the Universe . The seismologist John Milne , who created the modern seismograph in 1876 alongside Thomas Gray and James A. Ewing at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo , commented in 1886 on Zhang Heng 's contributions to seismology . The historian Joseph Needham emphasized his contributions to pre @-@ modern Chinese technology , stating that Zhang was noted even in his day for being able to " make three wheels rotate as if they were one . " More than one scholar has described Zhang as a polymath . However , some scholars also point out that Zhang 's writing lacks concrete scientific theories . Comparing Zhang with his contemporary , Ptolemy ( 83 – 161 ) of Roman Egypt , Jin <unk> , Fan Hongye , and Liu <unk> state : 
 Based on the theories of his predecessors , Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory . An armillary constructed on the basis of his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy 's earth @-@ centered theory . However , Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a theoretical model like Ptolemy 's earth @-@ centered one . It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy 's earth @-@ centered theory . Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth @-@ centered theory , but Chinese astronomers never took that step . 
 Here we can see how important the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is . In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry as a model for the development of astronomical theory , Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms . He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth @-@ centered theory . Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun , moon and planets move in circles , he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory . Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion ( that is , the length of the cyclic periods ) to establish astronomical theories . Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations , extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies . 
 = = = Poetic literature = = = 
 Zhang 's poetry was widely read during his life and after his death . In addition to the compilation of Xiao Tong mentioned above , the Eastern Wu official Xue Zong ( d . 237 ) wrote commentary on Zhang 's poems " Dongjing fu " and " Xijing fu " . The influential poet Tao Qian wrote that he admired the poetry of Zhang Heng for its " curbing extravagant diction and aiming at simplicity " , in regards to perceived tranquility and rectitude correlating with the simple but effective language of the poet . Tao wrote that both Zhang Heng and Cai Yong " avoided inflated language , aiming chiefly at simplicity " , and adding that their " compositions begin by giving free expression to their fancies but end on a note of quiet , serving admirably to restrain undisciplined and passionate nature " . 
 = = = Posthumous honors = = = 
 Zhang was given great honors in life and in death . The philosopher and poet Fu Xuan ( 217 – 278 ) of the Wei and Jin dynasties once lamented in an essay over the fact that Zhang Heng was never placed in the Ministry of Works . Writing highly of Zhang and the 3rd @-@ century mechanical engineer Ma Jun , Fu Xuan wrote , " Neither of them was ever an official of the Ministry of Works , and their ingenuity did not benefit the world . When ( authorities ) employ personnel with no regard to special talent , and having heard of genius neglect even to test it — is this not hateful and disastrous ? " 
 In honor of Zhang 's achievements in science and technology , his friend Cui <unk> ( Cui Yuan ) wrote a memorial inscription on his burial stele , which has been preserved in the <unk> yuan . Cui stated , " [ Zhang Heng 's ] mathematical computations exhausted ( the riddles of ) the heavens and the earth . His inventions were comparable even to those of the Author of Change . The excellence of his talent and the splendour of his art were one with those of the gods . " The minor official Xiahou Zhan ( 243 – 291 ) of the Wei Dynasty made an inscription for his own commemorative stele to be placed at Zhang Heng 's tomb . It read : " Ever since gentlemen have composed literary texts , none has been as skillful as the Master [ Zhang Heng ] in choosing his words well ... if only the dead could rise , oh I could then turn to him for a teacher ! " 
 Several things have been named after Zhang in modern times , including the lunar crater Chang Heng , the asteroid 1802 Zhang Heng , and the mineral <unk> .

 = Kawakita v. United States = 
 Kawakita v. United States , 343 U.S. 717 ( 1952 ) , [ 1 ] is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that a dual U.S. / Japanese citizen could be convicted of treason against the United States for acts performed in Japan during World War II . Tomoya Kawakita , born in California to Japanese parents , was in Japan when the war broke out and stayed in Japan until the war was over . After returning to the United States , he was arrested and charged with treason for having mistreated American prisoners of war . Kawakita claimed he could not be found guilty of treason because he had lost his U.S. citizenship while in Japan , but this argument was rejected by the courts ( including the Supreme Court ) , which ruled that he had in fact retained his U.S. citizenship during the war . Originally sentenced to death , Kawakita 's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment , and he was eventually released from prison , deported to Japan , and barred from ever returning to the United States . 
 = = Background = = 
 Tomoya Kawakita ( <unk> <unk> , Kawakita Tomoya ) was born in Calexico , California , on September 26 , 1921 , of Japanese @-@ born parents . He was born with U.S. citizenship due to his place of birth , and also Japanese nationality via his parents . After finishing high school in Calexico in 1939 , Kawakita traveled to Japan with his father ( a grocer and merchant ) . He remained in Japan and enrolled in Meiji University in 1941 . In 1943 , he registered officially as a Japanese national . 
 Kawakita was in Japan when the attack on Pearl Harbor drew the United States and Japan into World War II . In 1943 , he took a job as an interpreter at a mining and metal processing plant which used Allied prisoners of war ( POWs ) as laborers . By early 1945 , the population of the POW camp included about four hundred captured American troops . After the end of the war , Kawakita renewed his U.S. passport , explaining away his having registered as a Japanese national by claiming he had acted under duress . He returned to the U.S. in 1946 and enrolled at the University of Southern California . 
 In October 1946 , a former POW saw Kawakita in a Los Angeles department store and recognized him from the war . He reported this encounter to the FBI , and in June 1947 , Kawakita was arrested and charged with multiple counts of treason arising from alleged abuse of American POWs . 
 = = Trial and appeal = = 
 At Kawakita 's trial , presided over by U.S. District Judge William C. Mathes , the defense conceded that Kawakita had acted abusively toward American POWs , but argued that his actions were relatively minor , and that in any event , they could not constitute treason against the United States because Kawakita was not a U.S. citizen at the time , having lost his U.S. citizenship when he confirmed his Japanese nationality in 1943 . The prosecution argued that Kawakita had known he was still a U.S. citizen and still owed allegiance to the country of his birth — citing the statements he had made to consular officials when applying for a new passport as evidence that he had never intended to give up his U.S. citizenship . 
 Judge Mathes 's instructed the jury that if they found that Kawakita had genuinely believed he was no longer a U.S. citizen , then he must be found not guilty of treason . During the course of their deliberations , the jury reported several times that they were hopelessly deadlocked , but the judge insisted each time that they continue trying to reach a unanimous verdict . In the end — on September 2 , 1948 — the jury found Kawakita guilty of eight of the thirteen counts of treason against him , and he was sentenced to death . As a consequence of his conviction for treason , Kawakita 's U.S. citizenship was also revoked . In passing sentence , Mathes said : " Reflection leads to the conclusion that the only worthwhile use for the life of a traitor , such as this defendant has proved to be , is to serve as an example to those of weak moral fiber who may hereafter be tempted to commit treason against the United States . " 
 Kawakita appealed to a three @-@ judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , which unanimously upheld the verdict and death sentence . Certiorari was granted by the United States Supreme Court , and oral arguments before the Supreme Court were heard on April 3 , 1952 . 
 = = Opinion of the Court = = 
 In a 4 – 3 decision issued on June 2 , 1952 , the Supreme Court upheld Kawakita 's treason conviction and death sentence . The Court 's opinion was written by Associate Justice William O. Douglas , joined by Associate Justices Stanley F. Reed , Robert H. Jackson , and Sherman Minton . 
 The Court 's majority held that the jury in Kawakita 's trial had been justified in concluding that he had not lost or given up his U.S. citizenship while he was in Japan during the war . The Court added that an American citizen owed allegiance to the United States , and could be found guilty of treason , no matter where he lived — even for actions committed in another country that also claimed him as a citizen . Further , given the flagrant nature of Kawakita 's actions , the majority found that the trial judge had not acted arbitrarily in imposing a death sentence . 
 = = = Dissent = = = 
 Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson authored a dissenting opinion , which was joined by Associate Justices Hugo Black and Harold H. Burton . The dissent concluded that " for over two years , [ Kawakita ] was consistently demonstrating his allegiance to Japan , not the United States . As a matter of law , he expatriated himself as well as that can be done . " On this basis , the dissenting justices would have reversed Kawakita 's treason conviction . 
 = = Subsequent developments = = 
 On October 29 , 1953 , President Dwight D. Eisenhower commuted Kawakita 's sentence to life imprisonment plus a $ 10 @,@ 000 fine . After the commutation of his sentence , Kawakita was transferred to the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary . Ten years later , on October 24 , 1963 , President John F. Kennedy — in what would be one of his last official acts before his assassination — ordered Kawakita released from prison on the condition that he leave the United States and be banned from ever returning . Kawakita flew to Japan on December 13 , 1963 and reacquired Japanese citizenship upon his arrival . In 1978 , Kawakita sought permission to travel to the United States to visit his parents ' grave , but his efforts were unsuccessful . As of late 1993 , he was living quietly with relatives in Japan . 
 = Flexible @-@ fuel vehicles in Brazil = 
 The fleet of flexible @-@ fuel vehicles in Brazil is the largest in the world , and since their inception in 2003 , a total of 20 million flex fuel cars and light trucks have been manufactured in the country by June 2013 , and over 3 million flexible @-@ fuel motorcycles by October 2013 . Registrations of flex @-@ fuel autos and light trucks represented 87 @.@ 0 % of all passenger and light duty vehicles sold in 2012 , while flexible @-@ fuel motorcycles represented a 48 @.@ 2 % of the domestic motorcycle production in 2012 . There are over 80 flex car and light truck models available in the market manufactured by 14 major carmakers , and five flex @-@ fuel motorcycles models available as of December 2012 . 
 Brazilian flexible @-@ fuel vehicles are optimized to run on any mix of E20 @-@ E25 gasoline and up to 100 % hydrous ethanol fuel ( E100 ) . Flex vehicles in Brazil are built @-@ in with a small gasoline reservoir for cold starting the engine when temperatures drop below 15 ° C ( 59 ° F ) . An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009 which eliminated the need for the secondary gas tank . 
 According to two separate research studies conducted in 2009 , 65 % of the flex @-@ fuel registered vehicles regularly use ethanol fuel , and use climbs to 93 % of flex car owners in São Paulo , the main ethanol producer state where local taxes are lower , and prices are more competitive than gasoline . However , as a result of higher ethanol prices caused by the Brazilian ethanol industry crisis that began in 2009 , by November 2013 only 23 % flex @-@ fuel car owners were using ethanol regularly , down from 66 % in 2009 . 
 = = History = = 
 After the 1973 oil crisis , the Brazilian government made mandatory the use of ethanol blends with gasoline , and neat ethanol @-@ powered cars ( E100 only ) were launched to the market in 1979 , after testing with several prototypes developed by four carmakers . Brazilian carmakers modified gasoline engines to support ethanol characteristics and changes included compression ratio , amount of fuel injected , replacement of materials that would get corroded by the contact with ethanol , use of colder spark plugs suitable for dissipating heat due to higher flame temperatures , and an auxiliary cold @-@ start system that injects gasoline from a small tank in the engine compartment to help starting when cold . 
 Flexible @-@ fuel technology started being developed only by the end of the 1990s by Brazilian engineers and in March 2003 Volkswagen do Brasil launched in the market the Gol 1 @.@ 6 Total Flex , the first commercial flexible fuel vehicle capable of running on any blend of gasoline and ethanol . 
 = = Technology = = 
 The Brazilian flexible fuel car is built with an ethanol @-@ ready engine and one fuel tank for both fuels . The small gasoline reservoir for starting the engine with pure ethanol in cold weather , used in earlier ethanol @-@ only vehicles , was kept in the first generation of Brazilian flexible @-@ fuel cars , mainly for users of the central and southern regions , where winter temperatures normally drop <unk> ° C ( 59 ° F ) . An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009 that allowed for the elimination of this secondary gas reservoir tank . 
 A key innovation in the Brazilian flex technology was avoiding the need for an additional dedicated sensor to monitor the ethanol @-@ gasoline mix , which made the first American M85 flex fuel vehicles too expensive . This was accomplished through the lambda probe , used to measure the quality of combustion in conventional engines , is also required to tell the engine control unit ( ECU ) which blend of gasoline and alcohol is being burned . This task is accomplished automatically through software developed by Brazilian engineers , called " Software Fuel Sensor " ( SFS ) , fed with data from the standard sensors already built @-@ in the vehicle . The technology was developed by the Brazilian subsidiary of <unk> 1994 , but was further improved and commercially implemented in 2003 by the Italian subsidiary of Magneti Marelli , located in <unk> , São Paulo . A similar fuel injection technology was developed by the Brazilian subsidiary of Delphi Automotive Systems , and it is called " Multifuel " , based on research conducted at its facility in Piracicaba , São Paulo . This technology allows the controller to regulate the amount of fuel injected and spark time , as fuel flow needs to be decreased and also self @-@ combustion needs to be avoided when gasoline is used because ethanol engines have compression ratio around 12 : 1 , too high for gasoline . 
 Brazilian flex engines are being designed with higher compression ratios , taking advantage of the higher ethanol blends and maximizing the benefits of the higher oxygen content of ethanol , resulting in lower emissions and improving fuel efficiency . The following table shows the evolution and improvement of the different generations of flex engines developed in Brazil . 
 Brazilian flex cars are capable of running on just hydrated ethanol ( E100 ) , or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25 % anhydrous ethanol , or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels . Pure gasoline is no longer sold in the country because these high ethanol blends are mandatory since 1993 . Therefore , all Brazilian automakers have optimized flex vehicles to run with gasoline blends from E20 to E25 , so these FFVs are unable to run smoothly with pure gasoline with the exception of two models are specifically built with a flex @-@ fuel engine optimized to operate also with pure gasoline ( E0 ) , the Renault Clio Hi @-@ Flex and the Fiat Siena <unk> . 
 The flexibility of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers to choose the fuel depending on current market prices . As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol 's energy content is close to 34 % less per unit volume than gasoline , flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline . However , this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel . As a rule of thumb , Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30 % lower or more than gasoline , as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests .

 After the market launch of the Gol 1 @.@ 6 Total Flex , the first commercial flexible fuel vehicle capable of running on any blend of gasoline and ethanol , GM do Brasil followed three months later with the Chevrolet Corsa 1 @.@ 8 Flexpower , using an engine developed by a joint @-@ venture with Fiat called PowerTrain . As of July 2013 , the following 14 carmakers build and sell flexible fuel vehicles in Brazil : Citroën , Chery , Fiat , Ford , GM do Brasil ( Chevrolet ) , Honda , Hyundai , Kia Motors , Mitsubishi , Nissan , Peugeot , Renault , Toyota and Volkswagen . 
 Flexible fuel vehicles were 22 % of the new car sales in 2004 , 73 % in 2005 , 87 @.@ 6 % in July 2008 , and reached a record 94 % in August 2009 . The production of flex @-@ fuel cars and light commercial vehicles since 2003 reached 10 million vehicles in March 2010 , and 15 million in January 2012 . Registrations of flex @-@ fuel cars and light trucks represented 87 @.@ 0 % of all passenger and light duty vehicles sold in the country in 2012 . Production passed the 20 million @-@ unit mark in June 2013 . By the end of 2014 , flex @-@ fuel cars represented 54 % of the Brazilian registered stock of light @-@ duty vehicles , while gasoline only vehicles represented 34 @.@ 3 % . As of June 2015 , flex @-@ fuel light @-@ duty vehicle sales totaled 25 @.@ 5 million units . 
 The rapid success of flex vehicles was made possible by the existence of 33 @,@ 000 filling stations with at least one ethanol pump available by 2006 , a heritage of the early Pró @-@ Álcool ethanol program . These facts , together with the mandatory use of E25 blend of gasoline throughout the country , allowed Brazil in 2008 to achieve more than 50 % of fuel consumption in the gasoline market from sugar cane @-@ based ethanol . 
 According to two separate research studies conducted in 2009 , at the national level 65 % of the flex @-@ fuel registered vehicles regularly used ethanol fuel , and use climbed to 93 % in São Paulo , the main ethanol producer state where local taxes are lower , and E100 prices at the pump are usually more competitive than gasoline . However , as a result of higher ethanol prices caused by the Brazilian ethanol industry crisis that began in 2009 , combined with government subsidies set to keep gasoline price lower than the international market value , by November 2013 only 23 % flex @-@ fuel car owners were using ethanol regularly , down from 66 % in 2009 .

Delphi Automotive Systems also presented in 2007 its Multifuel injection technology for motorcycles . Besides the flexibility in the choice of fuels , a main objective of the fuel @-@ flex motorcycles is to reduce CO2 emissions by 20 percent , and savings in fuel consumption in the order of 5 % to 10 % are expected . AME Amazonas <unk> announced that sales of its motorcycle AME GA ( G stands for gasoline and A for alcohol ) were scheduled for 2009 , but the first flex @-@ fuel motorcycle was actually launched by Honda in March 2009 . Produced by its Brazilian subsidiary Moto Honda da Amazônia , the CG 150 Titan Mix is sold for around US $ 2 @,@ 700 . 
 Because the CG 150 Titan Mix does not have a secondary gas tank for a cold start like the Brazilian flex cars do , the tank must have at least 20 % of gasoline to avoid start up problems at temperatures below 15 ° C ( 59 ° F ) . The motorcycle ’ s panel includes a gauge to warn the driver about the actual ethanol @-@ gasoline mix in the storage tank . In September 2009 , Honda launched a second flexible @-@ fuel motorcycle , the on @-@ off road NXR 150 Bros Mix . During the first eight months after its market launch the CG 150 Titan Mix sold 139 @,@ 059 motorcycles , capturing a 10 @.@ 6 % market share , and ranking second in sales of new motorcycles in the Brazilian market by October 2009 , and by year 's end , both Honda flexible @-@ fuel motorcycles sold a total of 183 @,@ 375 units , representing an 11 @.@ 4 % market share of the Brazilian new motorcycle sales in that year .

 = Rachel Chiesley , Lady Grange = 
 Rachel Chiesley , usually known as Lady Grange ( 1679 – 1745 ) , was the wife of Lord Grange , a Scottish lawyer with Jacobite sympathies . After 25 years of marriage and nine children , the Granges separated acrimoniously . When Lady Grange produced letters that she claimed were evidence of his treasonable <unk> against the Hanoverian government in London , her husband had her kidnapped in 1732 . She was incarcerated in various remote locations on the western seaboard of Scotland , including the Monach Isles , Skye and the distant islands of St Kilda . 
 Lady Grange 's father was convicted of murder and she is known to have had a violent temper ; initially her absence seems to have caused little comment . News of her plight eventually reached her home town of Edinburgh however , and an unsuccessful rescue attempt was undertaken by her lawyer , Thomas Hope of <unk> . She died in captivity , after being in effect imprisoned for 13 years . Her life has been remembered in poetry , prose and plays . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Rachel Chiesley was one of ten children born to John Chiesley of Dalry and Margaret Nicholson . The marriage was unhappy and Margaret took her husband to court for aliment . She was awarded 1 @,@ 700 merks by Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath , the Lord President of the Court of Session . Furious with the result , John Chiesley shot Lockhart dead on the High Street of Edinburgh as he walked home from church on Easter Sunday , 31 March 1689 . The assailant made no attempt to escape and confessed at his trial , held before the Lord Provost the next day . Two days later he was taken from the Tolbooth to the Mercat Cross on the High Street . His right hand was cut off before he was hanged , and the pistol he had used for the murder was placed round his neck . Rachel Chiesley 's birthday is unknown but she was baptised on 4 February 1679 and was probably born shortly before then , making her about ten years old at the time of her father 's execution . 
 = = Marriage and children = = 
 The date of Chiesley 's marriage to James Erskine is uncertain : based on the text of a letter she wrote much later in life , it may have been in 1707 when she was about 28 . Erskine was the younger son of Charles Erskine , Earl of Mar and in 1689 his older brother John Erskine , became Earl of Mar on their father 's death . These were politically troubled times ; the Jacobite cause was still popular in many parts of Scotland , and the younger Earl was nicknamed " <unk> John " for his varied <unk> . After playing a prominent role in the Jacobite rebellion of 1715 he was stripped of his title , sent into exile , and never returned to Scotland . 
 The young Lady Grange has been described as a " wild beauty " , and it is likely the marriage only took place after she became pregnant . This uncertain background notwithstanding , Lord and Lady Grange led a superficially uneventful domestic life . They divided their time between a town house at the foot of Niddry 's Wynd off the High Street in Edinburgh and an estate at Preston ( near Prestonpans in East Lothian ) , where Lady Grange was the factor ( or supervisor ) for a time . Her husband was a successful lawyer , becoming Lord Justice Clerk in 1710 , and the marriage produced nine children : 
 Charlie , born August 1709 . 
 <unk> , born March 1711 , died age two months . 
 James , born March 1713 . He married his uncle " <unk> " John 's daughter Frances . Their son John eventually became Earl of Mar after the title was restored . 
 Mary , born July 1714 , who married John Keith the 3rd Earl of Kintore in August 1729 . 
 Meggie , who died young in May 1717 . 
 Fannie , born December 1716 . 
 Jeannie , born in December 1717 . 
 Rachel . 
 John . 
 In addition , Lady Grange miscarried twice and one of the above children is known to have died in 1721 . 
 = = <unk> and separation = = 
 There was evidently an element of discord in the marriage that eventually became public knowledge . In late 1717 or early 1718 , Erskine received warnings from a friend that he had enemies in the government . At about the same time one of the children 's tutors recorded in his diary that Lady Grange was " imperious with an unreasonable temper " . Her outbursts were evidently also capable of frightening her younger daughters and after Lady Grange 's kidnapping , no action was ever taken on her behalf by any of her children , the eldest of whom would have been in their early twenties when she was abducted . Macaulay writes that " [ t ] he calm acceptance by the family of their mother 's disappearance would persuade many that it need not be a matter of concern to them either " . This restraint may have been influenced by the fact their mother had previously disinherited all of them when the youngest were still infants , an outcome described as " unnatural " by the Sobieski Stuarts , two English brothers who claimed descent from Prince Charles Edward Stuart . 
 As the <unk> ' marriage trouble increased , Lady Grange 's behaviour became increasingly unpredictable . In 1730 , the <unk> of the Preston estate was removed from her , further increasing her angst . Her discovery of an affair her husband was conducting with coffeehouse owner Fanny Lindsay can only have made matters worse . In April of that year , she threatened suicide and to run naked through the streets of Edinburgh . She may have kept a razor under her pillow and attempted to intimidate her husband by reminding him whose daughter she was . On 27 July , she signed a formal letter of separation from James Erskine but things did not improve . For example , she barracked her husband in the street and in church and he and one of their children were forced to hide from her in a tavern for two hours or more on one occasion . She intercepted one of his letters and took it to the authorities alleging it was evidence of treason . She is also said to have stood outside the house in Niddry 's Wynd , waving the letter and shouting obscenities on at least two occasions . In January 1732 she booked a stagecoach to London and James Erskine and his friends , afraid her presence there would cause them further trouble , decided it was time to take decisive action . 
 = = Kidnap = = 
 Lady Grange was abducted from her home on the night of 22 January 1732 by two Highland noblemen , Roderick MacLeod of Berneray and Macdonald of Morar , and several of their men . After a bloody struggle , she was taken out of the city in a sedan chair and then on horseback to Wester <unk> near Falkirk , where she was held until 15 August on the ground floor of an uninhabited tower . She was by then over fifty years old . 
 From there she was taken west by Peter Fraser ( a page of Lord Lovat ) and his men through Perthshire . At <unk> , according to MacGregor tradition , she was entertained in the great hall , provided with a meal of venison , and slept on a heather bed covered with deerskins . The existence of St Fillan 's Pool on the River Fillan near <unk> would have provided useful cover for her captors : it was regularly used as a cure for insanity , which would have helped to explain her presence to the curious . The details of the onward route from there are not clear but it is likely she was taken through Glen Coe to Loch Ness and then through Glen Garry to Loch Hourn on the west coast . After a short delay she was then put on board ship to the Monach Isles . The difficulty of her position must have quickly become evident . She was in the company of men whose loyalty was to clan chieftains rather than the law , and few of them spoke any English at all . Their native Gaelic would have been incomprehensible to her , although as her years of captivity wore on she slowly learned something of the language . She complained that young members of the local aristocracy visited her as she waited by the shores of Loch Hourn , but that " they came with design to see me , but not to relieve me " . 
 = = Monach Isles = = 
 The Monach Isles , also known as <unk> , lie 8 kilometres ( 5 mi ) west of North Uist in the Outer Hebrides , an archipelago itself lying off the western coast of Scotland . The main islands are Ceann Ear , Ceann Iar and <unk> , which are all linked at low tide and have a combined area of 357 hectares ( 880 acres ) . The islands are low @-@ lying and fertile , and their population in the 18th century may have been about 100 . At the time they were owned by Sir Alexander MacDonald of Sleat , and Lady Grange was housed with his <unk> , another Alexander MacDonald , and his wife . When she complained about her condition , she was told by her host that he had no orders to provide her with either clothes , or food other than the normal fare he and his wife were used to . She lived in isolation for two years , not even being told the name of the island where she was living , and it took her some time to find out who her landlord was . She was there until June 1734 , when John and Norman MacLeod from North Uist arrived to move her on . They told her they were taking her to Orkney , but instead set sail for the Atlantic outliers of St Kilda . 
 = = St Kilda = = 
 One of the more poignant ruins on the island of Hirta in the St Kilda archipelago is the site of Lady Grange 's House . The " house " is in fact a large cleit or stone storage hut in the Village meadows that is said to resemble " a giant Christmas pudding " . Some authorities believe it was rebuilt on the site of a larger blackhouse where she lived during her incarceration , although in 1838 the grandson of a St Kildan who had assisted her quoted the dimensions as being " 20 feet by 10 feet " ( 7 metres by 3 metres ) , which is roughly the size of the cleit . 
 Hirta is more remote than the Monach Isles , lying 66 kilometres ( 41 mi ) west @-@ northwest of Benbecula in the North Atlantic Ocean and the predominant theme of life on St Kilda was isolation . When Martin Martin visited the islands in 1697 , the only means of making the journey was by open longboat , which could take several days and nights of rowing and sailing across the open ocean and was next to impossible in autumn and winter . In all seasons , waves up to 12 metres ( 40 ft ) high lash the beach of Village Bay , and even on calmer days landing on the slippery rocks can be hazardous . Cut off by distance and weather , the natives knew little of the rest of the world . 
 Lady Grange 's circumstances were correspondingly more uncomfortable and no @-@ one on the island spoke any English . She described Hirta as " a <unk> <unk> , stinking poor Isle " and insisted that " I was in great <unk> in the Husker but I 'm ten times worse and worse here " . Her lodgings were very primitive . They had an earthen floor , rain ran down the walls and in winter snow had to be scooped out in handfuls from behind the bed . She spent her days asleep , drank as much whisky as was available to her , and wandered the shore at night bemoaning her fate . During her sojourn on Hirta she wrote two letters relating her story , which eventually reached Edinburgh . One , dated 20 January 1738 , found its way to Thomas Hope of <unk> , her lawyer , in December 1740 . Some sources state that the first letter had been hidden in some yarn that was collected as part of a rent payment and taken to Inverness and thence to Edinburgh . The idea of the letter 's concealment in yarn is also mentioned by James Boswell in his Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides ( 1785 ) . However , Macaulay states that this method for the delivery of the letter ( s ) has " no basis in reality " and that both letters were smuggled off Hirta by Roderick MacLennan , the island 's minister . Whatever its route , the letter caused a sensation in Edinburgh although James Erskine 's friends managed to block attempts by Hope to obtain a warrant to search St Kilda . 
 In the second letter , addressed to Dr Carlyle , minister of Inveresk , Lady Grange writes bitterly of the roles of Lord Lovat and Roderick MacLeod in her capture and bemoans being described by Sir Alexander MacDonald as " the cargo " . Hope had known of Lady Grange 's removal from Edinburgh but had assumed she would be well cared for . Appalled by her condition , he paid for a sloop with twenty armed men on board to go to St Kilda at his own expense . It had already set sail by 14 February 1741 , but it arrived too late . Lady Grange had been removed from the island , probably in the summer of 1740 . 
 After the Battle of Culloden in 1746 , it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart and some of his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda . An expedition was launched , and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta . They found a deserted village , as the St Kildans , fearing pirates , had fled to caves to the west . When they were persuaded to come down , the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the Prince and had never heard of King George II either . Paradoxically , Lady Grange 's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition . 
 = = Skye = = 
 By 1740 Lady Grange was 61 years old . Removed from St Kilda in haste , she was transported to various locations in the Gàidhealtachd including possibly Assynt in the far north west of mainland Scotland and the Outer Hebridean locations of Harris and Uist before arriving at Waternish on Skye in 1742 . Local folklore suggests she may have been kept for 18 months in a cave either at <unk> on the Trotternish peninsula or on the Duirinish coast near the stacks known as a " Macleod 's Maidens " . She was certainly later housed with Rory MacNeil at Trumpan in Waternish . She died there on 12 May 1745 , and MacNeil had her " decently interred " the following week in the local churchyard . For reasons unknown a second funeral was held at nearby Duirinish some time thereafter , where a large crowd gathered to watch the burial of a coffin filled with turf and stones . 
 It is sometimes stated that this was her third funeral , Lord Grange having conducted one in Edinburgh shortly after her kidnapping . However , this story first appears in writing in 1845 and no other evidence of its veracity has emerged . 
 = = Motivations = = 
 Lady Grange 's story is a remarkable one and various issues have been raised by Macaulay ( 2009 ) as requiring explanation . These include : what drove James Erskine to these extraordinary lengths ? ; why were so many individuals willing to participate in this illegal and dangerous kidnapping of his wife ? ; and how was she held for so long without rescue ? 
 The first and second of these issues are related . Erskine 's brother had already been exiled for his support of the Jacobites . Simon Fraser , Lord Lovat , a key figure in Lady Grange 's abduction was himself executed for his part in the Jacobite Rising of 1745 . No concrete evidence of Erskine 's plotting against the crown or government has ever emerged , but any threat of such exposure , whether based in fact or fantasy would certainly have been taken very seriously by all concerned . It was thus relatively easy for Erskine to find accomplices amongst the Highland gentry . In addition to Simon Fraser and Alexander Macdonald of Sleat , the Sobieski Stuarts listed Norman MacLeod of Dunvegan — who became known as " The Wicked Man " — as the senior accomplices . Erskine himself was a " singular compound of good and bad qualities " . In addition to his legal career he was elected to Parliament in 1734 and he survived the vicissitudes of the Jacobite rebellions unscathed . He was a philanderer and over @-@ partial to claret , whilst at the same time deeply religious . This last quality would have been instrumental in any decision not to have his wife assassinated , and he did not marry his long @-@ term partner Fanny Lindsay until after he had heard of the first Lady Grange 's death . 
 The reason no successful rescue was ever effected lies in the remoteness of the Hebrides from the anglophone world in the early 18th century . No reliable naval charts of the area became available until 1776 . Without local assistance and knowledge , finding a captive in this wilderness would have required a significant expeditionary force . Nonetheless , the lack of action taken by Edinburgh society in general and her children in particular to retrieve one of their own is remarkable . The Kirk hierarchy , for example , made no attempt to contact her or convey news of her condition to the capital , yet they could easily have done so . Whatever the call of morality and natural justice may have suggested , John Chiesley 's daughter evidently did not command a sympathetic audience in her home town . 
 In her account of the affair , Margaret Macaulay explores 18th @-@ century attitudes to women in general as a significant factor and notes that although numerous documents from the hands of Lord Grange 's friends and supporters are still extant , not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived , save that of Lady Grange herself . Divorces were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children . Furthermore , Lord Grange 's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour . Something of James Erskine 's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the House of Commons he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to witchcraft . Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his <unk> were met with laughter , which effectively ended his political career before it had begun . Writing in the mid @-@ 19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale from the perspective of the descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley 's kidnap and imprisonment . They emphasise Lady Grange 's personal shortcomings , although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and Member of Parliament and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence . 
 As for Lady Grange herself , her vituperative outbursts and indulgence in alcohol were clearly important factors in her undoing . Alexander Carlyle described her as " stormy and outrageous " , whilst noting that it was in her husband 's interests to exaggerate the nature of her violent emotions . Macaulay ( 2009 ) takes the view that the ultimate cause of her troubles was her reaction to her husband 's infidelity . In an attempt to end his relationship with Mrs Lindsay , ( who owned a coffee house in Haymarket , Edinburgh ) , Rachel threatened to expose him as a Jacobite sympathiser . Perhaps she did not understand the magnitude of this accusation and the danger it posed to her husband and his friends , or how ruthless their instincts of self @-@ preservation were likely to be .

 Rachel Chiesley 's tale inspired a romantic poem called " Epistle from Lady Grange to Edward D — Esq " written by William Erskine in 1798 and a 1905 novel entitled The Lady of Hirta , a Tale of the Isles by W. C. Mackenzie . Edwin Morgan also published a sonnet in 1984 called " Lady Grange on St Kilda " . The Straw Chair is a two @-@ act play by Sue Glover , also about the time on St Kilda , first performed in Edinburgh in 1988 . <unk> is a play about these same events by Judith Adams performed in 1996 at the Battersea Arts Centre , London and on BBC Radio 4 . 
 Boswell and Johnson discussed the subject in their 1773 tour of the Hebrides . Boswell wrote : " After dinner to @-@ day , we talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grange 's being sent to St Kilda , and confined there for several years , without any means of relief . Dr Johnson said , if M <unk> would let it be known that he had such a place for naughty ladies , he might make it a very profitable island . " 
 There are portraits of both James Erskine and Rachel Chiesley in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh , by William Aikman and Sir John Baptiste de Medina respectively . When the writer Margaret Macaulay sought them out she discovered they had been placed together in the same cold store . 
 = Bad Pharma = 
 Bad Pharma : How Drug Companies <unk> Doctors and Harm Patients is a book by British physician and academic Ben Goldacre about the pharmaceutical industry , its relationship with the medical profession , and the extent to which it controls academic research into its own products . It was published in the UK in September 2012 by the Fourth Estate imprint of HarperCollins , and in the United States in February 2013 by Faber and Faber . 
 Goldacre argues in the book that " the whole edifice of medicine is broken , " because the evidence on which it is based is systematically distorted by the pharmaceutical industry . He writes that the industry finances most of the clinical trials into its own products and much of doctors ' continuing education , that clinical trials are often conducted on small groups of unrepresentative subjects and negative data is routinely withheld , and that apparently independent academic papers may be planned and even ghostwritten by pharmaceutical companies or their contractors , without disclosure . Describing the situation as a " murderous disaster , " he makes suggestions for action by patients ' groups , physicians , academics and the industry itself . 
 Responding to the book 's publication , the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry issued a statement in 2012 arguing that the examples the book offers were historical , that the concerns had been addressed , that the industry is among the most regulated in the world , and that it discloses all data in accordance with international standards . 
 In January 2013 Goldacre joined the Cochrane Collaboration , British Medical Journal and others in setting up AllTrials , a campaign calling for the results of all past and current clinical trials to be reported . The British House of Commons Public Accounts Committee expressed concern in January 2014 that drug companies were still only publishing around 50 percent of clinical @-@ trial results . 
 = = Author = = 
 After graduating in 1995 with a first @-@ class honours degree in medicine from Magdalen College , Oxford , Goldacre obtained an MA in philosophy from King 's College London , then undertook clinical training at UCL Medical School , qualifying as a medical doctor in 2000 and as a psychiatrist in 2005 . As of 2014 he was Wellcome Research Fellow in Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine . 
 Goldacre is known for his " Bad Science " column in the Guardian , which he has written since 2003 , and for his first book , Bad Science ( 2008 ) . This unpicked the claims of several forms of alternative medicine , and criticized certain physicians and the media for a lack of critical thinking . It also looked at the MMR vaccine controversy , AIDS denialism , the placebo effect and the misuse of statistics . Goldacre was recognized in June 2013 by Health Service Journal as having done " more than any other single individual to shine a light on how science and research gets distorted by the media , politicians , quacks , PR and the pharmaceutical industry . " 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 = = = Introduction = = = 
 Goldacre writes in the introduction of Bad Pharma that he aims to defend the following : 
 Drugs are tested by the people who manufacture them , in poorly designed trials , on hopelessly small numbers of weird , unrepresentative patients , and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design , in such a way that they exaggerate the benefits of treatments . Unsurprisingly , these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer . When trials throw up results that companies don 't like , they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients , so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug 's true effects . Regulators see most of the trial data , but only from early on in a drug 's life , and even then they don 't give this data to doctors or patients , or even to other parts of government . This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion . 
 In their forty years of practice after leaving medical school , doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions , from sales reps , colleagues or journals . But those colleagues can be in the pay of drug companies – often undisclosed – and the journals are too . And so are the patient groups . And finally , academic papers , which everyone thinks of as objective , are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies , without disclosure . Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company . Aside from all this , for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine , we have no idea what the best treatment is , because it 's not in anyone 's financial interest to conduct any trials at all . 
 = = = Chapter 1 : " Missing Data " = = = 
 In " Missing Data , " Goldacre argues that the clinical trials undertaken by drug companies routinely reach conclusions favourable to the company . For example , in a 2007 journal article published in PLOS Medicine , researchers studied every published trial on statins , drugs prescribed to reduce cholesterol levels . In the 192 trials they looked at , industry @-@ funded trials were 20 times more likely to produce results that favoured the drug . 
 He writes that these positive results are achieved in a number of ways . Sometimes the industry @-@ sponsored studies are flawed by design ( for example by comparing the new drug to an existing drug at an inadequate dose ) , and sometimes patients are selected to make a positive result more likely . In addition , the data is analysed as the trial progresses . If the trial seems to be producing negative data it is stopped prematurely and the results are not published , or if it is producing positive data it may be stopped early so that longer @-@ term effects are not examined . He writes that this publication bias , where negative results remain unpublished , is endemic within medicine and academia . As a consequence , he argues , doctors may have no idea what the effects are of the drugs they prescribe . 
 An example he gives of the difficulty of obtaining missing data from drug companies is that of oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) , manufactured by Roche to reduce the complications of bird flu . Governments spent billions of pounds stockpiling this , based in large part on a meta @-@ analysis that was funded by the industry . Bad Pharma charts the efforts of independent researchers , particularly Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Collaboration Respiratory Group , to gain access to information about the drug . 
 = = = Chapter 2 : " Where Do New Drugs Come From ? " = = = 
 In the second chapter , the book describes the process as new drugs move from animal testing through phase 1 ( first @-@ in @-@ man study ) , phase 2 , and phase 3 clinical trials . Phase 1 participants are referred to as volunteers , but in the US are paid $ 200 – $ 400 per day , and because studies can last several weeks and subjects may volunteer several times a year , earning potential becomes the main reason for participation . Participants are usually taken from the poorest groups in society , and outsourcing increasingly means that trials may be conducted in countries with highly competitive wages by contract research organizations ( <unk> ) . The rate of growth for clinical trials in India is 20 percent a year , in Argentina 27 percent , and in China 47 percent , while trials in the UK have fallen by 10 percent a year and in the US by six percent . 
 The shift to outsourcing raises issues about data integrity , regulatory oversight , language difficulties , the meaning of informed consent among a much poorer population , the standards of clinical care , the extent to which corruption may be regarded as routine in certain countries , and the ethical problem of raising a population 's expectations for drugs that most of that population cannot afford . It also raises the question of whether the results of clinical trials using one population can invariably be applied elsewhere . There are both social and physical differences : Goldacre asks whether patients diagnosed with depression in China are really the same as patients diagnosed with depression in California , and notes that people of Asian descent metabolize drugs differently from Westerners . 
 There have also been cases of available treatment being withheld during clinical trials . In 1996 in Kano , Nigeria , the drug company Pfizer compared a new antibiotic during a meningitis outbreak to a competing antibiotic that was known to be effective at a higher dose than was used during the trial . Goldacre writes that 11 children died , divided almost equally between the two groups . The families taking part in the trial were apparently not told that the competing antibiotic at the effective dose was available from Médecins Sans Frontières in the next @-@ door building . 
 = = = Chapter 3 : " Bad Regulators " = = = 
 Chapter three describes the concept of " regulatory capture , " whereby a regulator – such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) in the UK , or the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in the United States – ends up advancing the interests of the drug companies rather than the interests of the public . Goldacre writes that this happens for a number of reasons , including the revolving door of employees between the regulator and the companies , and the fact that friendships develop between regulator and company employees simply because they have knowledge and interests in common . The chapter also discusses surrogate outcomes and accelerated approval , and the difficulty of having ineffective drugs removed from the market once they have been approved . He argues that regulators do not require that new drugs offer an improvement over what is already available , or even that they be particularly effective . 
 = = = Chapter 4 : " Bad Trials " = = = 
 " Bad Trials " examines the ways in which clinical trials can be flawed . Goldacre writes that this happens by design and by analysis , and that it has the effect of maximizing a drug 's benefits and minimizing harm . There have been instances of fraud , though he says these are rare . More common are what he calls the " wily tricks , close calls , and elegant mischief at the margins of acceptability . " 
 These include testing drugs on unrepresentative , " freakishly ideal " patients ; comparing new drugs to something known to be ineffective , or effective at a different dose or if used differently ; conducting trials that are too short or too small ; and stopping trials early or late . It also includes measuring uninformative outcomes ; packaging the data so that it is misleading ; ignoring patients who drop out ( i.e. using per @-@ protocol analysis , where only patients who complete the trial are counted in the final results , rather than intention @-@ to @-@ treat analysis , where everyone who starts the trial is counted ) ; changing the main outcome of the trial once it has finished ; producing subgroup analyses that show apparently positive outcomes for certain tightly defined groups ( such as Chinese men between the ages of 56 and 71 ) , thereby hiding an overall negative outcome ; and conducting " seeding trials , " where the objective is to persuade physicians to use the drug . 
 Another criticism is that outcomes are presented in terms of relative risk reduction to exaggerate the apparent benefits of the treatment . For example , he writes , if four people out of 1 @,@ 000 will have a heart attack within the year , but on statins only two will , that is a 50 percent reduction if expressed as relative risk reduction . But if expressed as absolute risk reduction , it is a reduction of just 0 @.@ 2 percent . 
 = = = Chapter 5 : " Bigger , Simpler Trials " = = = 
 In chapter five Goldacre suggests using the General Practice Research Database in the UK , which contains the <unk> records of several million patients , to conduct randomized trials to determine the most effective of competing treatments . For example , to compare two statins , atorvastatin and simvastatin , doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other . The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels , heart attacks , strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records . The trials would not be blind – patients would know which statin they had been prescribed – but Goldacre writes that they would be unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable to the extent that it could affect their health . 
 = = = Chapter 6 : " Marketing " = = = 
 In the final chapter , Goldacre looks at how doctors are persuaded to prescribe " me @-@ too drugs , " brand @-@ name drugs that are no more effective than significantly cheaper off @-@ patent ones . He cites as examples the statins atorvastatin ( Lipitor , made by Pfizer ) and simvastatin ( <unk> ) , which he writes seem to be equally effective , or at least there is no evidence to suggest otherwise . <unk> came off patent several years ago , yet there are still three million prescriptions a year in the UK for atorvastatin , costing the National Health Service ( NHS ) an annual £ 165 million extra . 
 He addresses the issue of medicalization of certain conditions ( or , as he argues , of personhood ) , whereby pharmaceutical companies " widen the boundaries of diagnosis " before offering solutions . Female sexual dysfunction was highlighted in 1999 by a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , which alleged that 43 percent of women were suffering from it . After the article appeared , the New York Times wrote that two of its three authors had worked as consultants for Pfizer , which at the time was preparing to launch UK @-@ 414 @,@ 495 , known as female Viagra . The journal 's editor said that the failure to disclose the relationship with Pfizer was the journal 's mistake . 
 The chapter also examines celebrity endorsement of certain drugs , the extent to which claims in advertisements aimed at doctors are appropriately sourced , and whether direct @-@ to @-@ consumer advertising ( currently permitted in the US and New Zealand ) ought to be allowed . It discusses how PR firms promote stories from patients who complain in the media that certain drugs are not made available by the funder , which in the UK is the NHS and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) . Two breast @-@ cancer patients who campaigned in the UK in 2006 for trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) to be available on the NHS were being handled by a law firm working for Roche , the drug 's manufacturer . The historian Lisa Jardine , who was suffering from breast cancer , told the Guardian that she had been approached by a PR firm working for the company . 
 The chapter also covers the influence of drug reps , how ghostwriters are employed by the drug companies to write papers for academics to publish , how independent the academic journals really are , how the drug companies finance doctors ' continuing education , and how patients ' groups are often funded by industry . 
 = = = Afterword : " Better Data " = = = 
 In the afterword and throughout the book , Goldacre makes suggestions for action by doctors , medical students , patients , patient groups and the industry . He advises doctors , nurses and managers to stop seeing drug reps , to ban them from clinics , hospitals and medical schools , to declare online and in waiting rooms all gifts and hospitality received from the industry , and to remove all drug company promotional material from offices and waiting rooms . ( He praises the website of the American Medical Student Association – <unk> – which ranks institutions according to their conflict @-@ of @-@ interest policies , writing that it makes him " feel weepy . " ) He also suggests that regulations be introduced to prevent pharmacists from sharing doctors ' prescribing records with drug reps . 
 He asks academics to lobby their universities and academic societies to forbid academics from being involved in ghostwriting , and to lobby for " film credit " contributions at the end of every academic paper , listing everyone involved , including who initiated the idea of publishing the paper . He also asks for full disclosure of all past clinical trial results , and a list of academic papers that were , as he puts it , " rigged " by industry , so that they can be retracted or annotated . He asks drug company employees to become whistleblowers , either by writing an anonymous blog , or by contacting him . 
 He advises patients to ask their doctors whether they accept drug @-@ company hospitality or sponsorship , and if so to post details in their waiting rooms , and to make clear whether it is acceptable to the patient for the doctor to discuss his or her medical history with drug reps . Patients who are invited to take part in a trial are advised to ask , among other things , for a written guarantee that the trial has been publicly registered , and that the main outcome of the trial will be published within a year of its completion . He advises patient groups to write to drug companies with the following : " We are living with this disease ; is there anything at all that you 're withholding ? If so , tell us today . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 The book was generally well received . The Economist described it as " slightly technical , eminently readable , consistently shocking , occasionally hectoring and unapologetically polemical . " Helen Lewis in the New Statesman called it an important book , while Luisa <unk> , writing in the Guardian , described it as a " thorough piece of investigative medical journalism . " 
 Andrew Jack wrote in the Financial Times that Goldacre is " at his best in methodically dissecting poor clinical trials . ... He is less strong in explaining the complex background reality , such as the general constraints and individual slips of regulators and pharma companies ' employees . " Jack also argued that the book failed to reflect how many lives have been improved by the current system , for example with new treatments for HIV , rheumatoid arthritis and cancer . 
 Max Pemberton , a psychiatrist , wrote in the Daily Telegraph that " this is a book to make you enraged ... because it 's about how big business puts profits over patient welfare , allows people to die because they don 't want to disclose damning research evidence , and the tricks they play to make sure doctors do not have all the evidence when it comes to appraising whether a drug really works or not . " 
 The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry ( <unk> ) replied in the New Statesman that Goldacre was " stuck in a bygone era where pharmaceutical companies wine and dine doctors in exchange for signing on the dotted line . " The <unk> issued a press release , writing that the pharmaceutical industry is responsible for the discovery of 90 percent of all medicines , and that it takes an average of 10 – 12 years and £ <unk> to introduce a medicine to the market , with just one in 5 @,@ 000 new compounds receiving regulatory approval . This makes research and development an expensive and risky business . They wrote that the industry is one of the most heavily regulated in the world , and is committed to ensuring full transparency in the research and development of new medicines . They also maintained that the examples Goldacre offered were " long documented and historical , and the companies concerned have long addressed these issues . " Goldacre argues in the book that " the most dangerous tactic of all is the industry 's enduring claim that these problems are all in the past . " 
 Humphrey Rang of the British Pharmacological Society wrote that Goldacre had chosen his target well and had produced some shocking examples of secrecy and dishonesty , particularly the nondisclosure of data on the antidepressant <unk> ( chapter one ) , in which only one trial out of seven was published ( the published study showed positive results , while the unpublished trials suggested otherwise ) . He argued that Goldacre had gone " over the top " in devoting a whole chapter ( chapter five ) to recommending large clinical trials using electronic patient data from general practitioners , without fully pointing out how problematic these can be ; such trials raise issues , for example , about informed consent and regulatory oversight . Rang also criticized Goldacre 's style , describing the book as too long , repetitive , hyperbolic , and in places too conversational . He particularly objected to the line , " medicine is broken , " calling it a " foolish remark . "

 = The Secret River ( Rawlings book ) = 
 The Secret River is a children 's fantasy book by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings , author of the The Yearling . Published in 1955 , The Secret River received a Newbery Honor Award . The first edition , illustrated by Caldecott Medal winner Leonard Weisgard , was issued after Rawlings ' death . The book was revised and reissued in 2009 with illustrations by Caldecott Medalists Leo and Diane Dillon . The new edition received an international children 's book design award in 2012 . The Secret River is the only book Rawlings wrote specifically for children . The story of young Calpurnia , who goes on a quest to find a magical river and catch fish for her starving family and friends , it has two themes common in Rawlings ' writing , the magic of childhood and the struggle of people to survive in a harsh environment . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Secret River is a story of Magical realism , blending real life and fantasy . Young Calpurnia is an aspiring poet living in rural Central Florida during the Great Depression . Hard times have come to her people ; the animals have disappeared , her father is unable to catch fish to sell , and everyone in the community is too weak from hunger to work . Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog , Buggy @-@ Horse , to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about . She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop . When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to catch some fish and uses her creativity , and the pink ribbons from her hair , to catch them . On her way home , an owl , a bear and a panther each challenge her , and she has to give away some of her catch to get home . She also shares some fish with Mother Albirtha and takes the rest to her father , who gives them to the starving people in return for future payment . Strengthened by the fish , people begin working again . When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again , but cannot find it , as she no longer really needs it . Still , she realizes nothing is lost to us forever , and the book ends with one of her poems , expressing this sentiment : 
 Secret River is in my mind . 
 I can go there any time . 
 Everything Mother Albirtha says is true . 
 The sky is gold and the river is blue . 
 Secret River , I love you . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Secret River is Rawlings ' only book intended for children . According to Murray Laurie , the idea for the book came from something Rawlings had written in Cross Creek : “ some day a poet will write a sad and lovely story of a Negro child . ” She discussed the idea with her Scribner 's editor , Maxwell Perkins , who encouraged her to follow it up . While working on the manuscript she told Perkins she " deliberately avoided Negro dialect . ' No Uncle Remus or Little Black Sambo sort of stuff ' " . At one point she thought about making the story into a full @-@ length novel . Helen Masten , writing for The Saturday Review , commented " Had this happened this little masterpiece of the imagination of childhood might never have reached children , to whom it rightly belongs . " Rawlings also talked about her ideas with Bob Camp , an illustrator and friend . From that conversation , Camp produced a series of paintings to illustrate the idea . In 1947 Rawlings sent The Secret River 's manuscript to Perkins , and Camp visited his office in New York with the paintings . When Perkins responded with suggestions , Rawlings confessed to him that she was not completely pleased with Camp 's illustrations . By June of that year , Perkins ' death from pneumonia and Rawlings ' own personal problems had derailed the project . After Rawlings ' death in 1953 , the manuscript for The Secret River was the only complete manuscript found among her papers . 
 In Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings ' Rivers Lamar York says that Rawlings ' settings are an essential part of her plots , and that she did not choose to write about a river by accident . At a low time in her life she had taken time off and traveled the length of the St. Johns River with a friend . Later she wrote about the boat trip in " Hyacinth Drift " , a chapter of Cross Creek . The trip , she said , cured her depression and allowed her to live in peace , as The Secret River did for Calpurnia and her community . The river , York writes , expresses Rawlings ' belief that " man must know or discover a relationship to a suitable physical setting " in order to survive the harshness of the world , as she herself did on the St. Johns . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The Secret River 's primary theme revolves around Calpurnia 's desire to help her family and friends survive tough times . As Barbara <unk> wrote in School Library Journal , " <unk> the adventure is the determination and spirited effort of the child to help her family in need . " The struggle to live in the face of difficult circumstances was a common theme for Rawlings . In The Secret River this struggle means Calpurnia must find her way to the river , convince it to yield its precious fish , then overcome danger from starving wild animals to return with the fish to her father . Calpurnia 's courage and determination enable her to overcome every obstacle and save her community . 
 <unk> against the struggle to survive is the enchanting but short beauty of childhood . The magic in the plot reinforces the sense of enchantment and gives the book a fairy @-@ tale like quality , leading the <unk> Awards jury to speak of " the great Secret ( that ) lurks in the story " . It is the child Calpurnia who follows the magic to find the river and save the adults from starvation . The contrast of an idealized and protected childhood with the harsh realities that adults must face is another theme common to Rawlings ' writings , expressed in the famous speech about adult reality Ezra " Penny " Baxter delivers to his son Jody at the end of The Yearling : " Ever ’ man wants life to be a fine thing , and a easy . ’ Tis fine , boy , powerful fine , but ’ <unk> ’ t easy . Life knocks a man down and he gits up and it knocks him down again . . . . What ’ s he to do then ? . . . Why , take it for his share and go on . " Unlike Jody , who realizes the magic of his childhood is " gone forever " with the death of his fawn , Calpurnia retains the secret river and the magic in her mind .

 The Secret River appeared two years after Rawlings ' death with illustrations by the 1948 Caldecott Medal winner Leonard Weisgard , who used coffee @-@ coloured paper as an innovative way to circumvent a taboo of the era against portraying dark @-@ skinned characters . In his book In the Company of Writers , Charles Scribner discusses The Secret River 's publication , noting Rawlings never mentions Calpurnia 's race . Since the book went into production after her death Rawlings could not be consulted about her final intentions . At this time the depiction of black children in American children 's literature had decreased until it was almost non @-@ existent . While a few books were still appearing , " White ( children 's ) publishers were still not open to books with Black themes " , according to Joyce Braden Harris on " African and African @-@ American Traditions in Language Arts " . Scribner pointed out that " Whatever our decision , we could land on the wrong side of the school boards " , and claims the idea for using dark paper in the book as a way to suggest Calpurnia 's race was his , calling it " one of my silent contributions to dissolving the color barrier in the 1950s . " The book received a Newbery Honor Award in 1956 for " the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children " , and was honored by the American Society of Graphic Arts . 
 Atheneum Books for Young Readers reissued a revised version of the book in 2009 . The story was shortened by cutting some descriptive passages and allowing the illustrations to convey the setting . Calpurnia 's final poem was also eliminated . New illustrations in acrylics were created by Leo and Diane Dillon , who went on to win two Caldecott Awards . Unlike the more realistic illustrations by Weisgard , the Dillons emphasized the magical reality of the story , as in the cover picture , where Calpurnia 's profile is almost hidden inside a stylized blue fish . Mary Harris Russell , writing for The Chicago Tribune , felt modern audiences would appreciate the way " the fantasy side to this land of cypress trees and silent rivers is amplified and contrasted with the realistic background of little Calpurnia 's life . " The Dillon 's version of The Secret River received one of two honorable mentions in the fiction category of the 2012 <unk> Awards , an international children 's book award that honors the art and design of illustrated books worldwide . In the words of the Bologna jury , " It is only fitting that Marjorie Rawlings , the great American writer loved by so many generations of readers , is finally paid such a refined and sensitive tribute . " 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 When The Secret River first appeared in 1955 , Saturday Review called it a " little masterpiece of the imagination of childhood ... so real and appealing one regrets that this is the only book the author wrote for children ... Leonard Weisgard has done some of his most sensitive work in drawings that have a feeling for character and place and are quite perfect for the text . " Decades later the book continued to receive strong reviews , with words like " Magical " and " timeless " . Reviewers appreciated the message of hope conveyed in the simple story . 
 The new edition of The Secret River also received positive reviews . Publishers Weekly gave it a starred review , as did Kirkus Reviews , calling it a " classic tale ... Rawlings ’ voice is warm and tender , employing lilting syntax and descriptive language that resonates with warmth and humor . Calpurnia is a sweet delight ... filled with love and compassion " , and the Dillon 's illustrations are , " glorious , glowing ... nothing short of breathtaking " . Monica and Hannah McRae Young , in their article " Books do justice to subjects of civil rights , racism " , praise The Secret River as " A rare picture book depicting everyday black life " . They believe modern readers will enjoy <unk> and Buggy @-@ horse as much as the original audience . Children 's Literature agreed that the reissue would renew interest in the book . 
 = Henry Dewar ( rugby ) = 
 Henry " <unk> " Dewar ( 13 October 1883 – 9 August 1915 ) was a New Zealand rugby union forward , who played for the All Blacks , and represented Taranaki and Wellington provinces . 
 Playing for the Melrose Club in Wellington , he was selected in 1908 for the provincial team that played and defeated the Anglo @-@ Welsh team on tour in New Zealand . After moving to Taranaki in 1910 , he was soon selected to represent the province . Coming close to winning the Ranfurly Shield in 1912 , a subsequent challenge the following year was successful against the longtime holders Auckland . He earned selection to the North Island team for the annual Inter @-@ Island match and thereafter was picked to play for the All Blacks , first to play Australia and then for the tour of North America , in which he played 14 of the 16 games , including the 51 – 3 defeat of the All America team . 
 Soon after the British Empire declared war on Germany on 5 August 1914 , Dewar signed up to the New Zealand Expeditionary Force , and took part in the expedition to occupy German Samoa , departing the day after he played for Taranaki defending a challenge from Wairarapa . On his return , he volunteered again for active service and enlisted in the Wellington Mounted Rifles , joining the machine gun section . After promotion to sergeant , he departed in October for Egypt . There , he captained his regiment 's rugby team in matches against other New Zealand and Australian regiments . He landed at Anzac Cove on 8 August 1915 and participated in the action to capture Chunuk Bair in the Gallipoli Campaign . The following day he was killed in action . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Henry Dewar , born 13 October 1883 in Foxton , New Zealand , was the son of Alexander and Lydia Dewar . He spent most of his early years in Wellington until moving to Taranaki in 1910 where he worked as an iron moulder for B. Harkness of Stratford . 
 = = Rugby career = = 
 Dewar first played for the Melrose Club in Wellington and was selected for Wellington province in 1907 . In 1908 , he was a member of the Wellington team that defeated the touring Anglo @-@ Welsh 19 – 13 on 27 May . The visitors played much of the game with fourteen players , only six forwards , after an injury in the first half : the captains , before the game , had agreed that there would be no substitutions for injury . Dewar and Rush , in particular , as well as Harding and Cracroft Wilson , bore the " heat and burden of a truly Homeric struggle . " 
 Later in the year , on 15 August , he took part in a Ranfurly Shield challenge , which resulted in a heavy 24 – 3 defeat for Wellington at the hands of Auckland . The challengers , away to Auckland , were the underdogs but it was expected to be a close game , and at half @-@ time Auckland were just leading by a conversion , 5 – 3 . In the second half , Auckland 's forwards imposed themselves on Wellington , who struggled to maintain the pace and were unable to respond to Auckland 's scoring . 
 Dewar moved to Taranaki in 1910 , where he played his club rugby for Stratford ; he captained the team in 1913 . He was first selected for Taranaki that year and continued to represent the club until the outbreak of the First World War . In 1912 , Taranaki , with Dewar in the team , came close to winning the Ranfurly Shield from Auckland , losing 6 – 5 . In front of a 12 @,@ 000 @-@ spectator home crowd , Auckland dominated in the first half , scoring six points through a try and a penalty kick . The second half saw Taranaki 's forwards take control for long periods , resulting in a converted try , but despite ongoing attacks , the visitors were unable to add to their score and lost by just one point . 
 = = = 1913 Season = = = 
 1913 saw Dewar 's best season . His provincial form saw him selected for the North Island in the annual Inter @-@ Island match , having been nominated for inclusion the previous year but not selected . In the event , the North was beaten 25 – 0 . He was then part of the Taranaki team that ended Auckland 's long tenure of the Ranfurly Shield , in a game described as " the finest match ... and the most exciting ... ever witnessed in the history of the Ranfurly Shield " . Taranaki controlled the first half , with the forwards stronger than their opponents in every aspect , scoring the first points . The visitors ' lead of 0 – 3 , however , changed to a half @-@ time score of 5 – 3 in Auckland 's favour after an injury temporarily reduced the opposition to fourteen men . Soon after the break , Taranaki took the lead through a try , and then a second — scored by Dewar , who was continuously " in the thick of it " — took them four points ahead , 5 – 9 . The home side responded with two tries of their own to take back a two @-@ point lead . Towards the end of the game , Taranaki scored one more try , which was converted and gave them a 14 – 11 victory to win the Shield for the first time : Auckland was the first team to be awarded the Shield in 1902 and , after Wellington won it in 1904 , regained it and held on to it continuously from 1906 . 
 He also played in the Taranaki side that was only narrowly beaten by the touring Australians in 1913 . His form in these games earned him a place with the All Blacks . On 6 September 1913 , he played in the 30 – 5 first test win over Australia at Athletic Park : Albert Downing and George Sellars played alongside him and were also later killed in action in the First World War . Dewar was then selected , along with four other Taranaki players , for the tour of North America , playing in 14 of the 16 games , including the 51 – 3 victory over the All America team for his second test cap . He received particular mention in the test match for a cunning dummy pass to Downing on his right , drawing the defence and passing to five @-@ eighths McKenzie on his left to run in for a try . He scored just one try . There was little interest in the American press about the tour . A single short paragraph in the New @-@ York Tribune reports on the 51 – 3 defeat of the USA team on 15 November . 
 In 1914 , Dewar participated in Taranaki 's defence of the Shield against Wellington on 24 June , winning 14 – 10 ; Wanganui , on 27 June , winning 17 – 3 ; Manawatu , on 23 July , winning 11 – 3 , with Dewar " prominent " ; Horowhenua ; and Wairarapa , on 14 August , winning 22 – 3 . Within days of this last game , a number of Taranaki 's players , including Dewar , left to join the New Zealand Expeditionary Force : " a brilliant forward ... who would almost certainly have gone to Australia this season [ on the All Blacks tour ] if he had been available for selection " . Although defeating Canterbury on 20 August , Taranaki 's pack was particularly weakened by Dewar 's absence , and only managed to win 6 – 5 with a last minute try . Against a second challenge from Wellington on 10 September , the conspicuous absence of this " fine leader of forwards " contributed to the loss of the Shield . 
 His obituary in The Sun described him as " one of the best forwards in the New Zealand team which visited California ... he was fast and very clever , and always gave of his best . He was a good all @-@ round athlete — an excellent boxer and no mean cricketer . "

 Dewar enlisted early , joining the New Zealand Expeditionary Force leaving on 15 August 1914 for German Samoa . On his return he volunteered again , joining the 9th Wellington Mounted Rifles as a machine gunner and was based at <unk> Racecourse , Palmerston North ; he was promoted quickly to sergeant . On 16 October 1914 , after training , Dewar embarked on the Orari at Wellington en route for Egypt . There , Dewar captained the Wellington Mounted Rifles rugby team in several matches against other regiments — beating the First Australian Light Horse , the Canterbury Mounted Rifles , and the Auckland Mounted Rifles — before his regiment landed on 8 August 1915 at Anzac Cove , Gallipoli . Twenty @-@ four hours later , on 9 August 1915 , Dewar lost his life in the assault on Chunuk Bair — Albert Downing was killed in the same action , the first All Black to be killed in the war . Sergeant Henry Dewar is commemorated on the Chunuk Bair ( NZ ) Memorial Turkey ( Panel 4 ) . 
 His mother , sister and brother published these words in memoriam : 
 Our thoughts they ever wander to a soldier 's honoured grave , 
 Never will we forget the noble sacrifice you made ; 
 For our hearts arc still united in that same fond love for you , 
 And loving thoughts are cherished of one so brave and true . 
 Your cheery , sunny countenance will not from memory fade , 
 For we see you in the photo , in the home you died to save ; 
 And when our hearts are sore for you we seem to hear you say , 
 Break not your heart , dear mother , we will meet on that Eternal Day . 
 So widely known ; so highly esteemed . 
 = Kandahar massacre = 
 The Kandahar massacre , more precisely identified as the Panjwai massacre , occurred in the early hours of 11 March 2012 , when United States Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales murdered sixteen civilians and wounded six others in the <unk> District of Kandahar Province , Afghanistan . Nine of his victims were children , and eleven of the dead were from the same family . Some of the corpses were partially burned . Bales was taken into custody later that morning when he told authorities , " I did it " . On 23 August 2013 , a jury at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord in Fort Lewis , Washington sentenced him to life in prison without parole . 
 American and International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) authorities apologized for the deaths . Afghan authorities condemned the act , describing it as " intentional murder " . The National Assembly of Afghanistan passed a resolution demanding a public trial in Afghanistan , but then @-@ U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said the soldier would be tried under U.S. military law . Bales pleaded guilty on 5 June 2013 to 16 counts of premeditated murder in exchange for the prosecution not seeking the death penalty . At the time of the plea , he stated that he did not know why he committed the murders . 
 United States authorities concluded that the killings were the act of a single individual . On 15 March 2012 , an Afghan parliamentary probe team made up of several members of the National Assembly of Afghanistan had speculated that up to 20 American soldiers were involved in the killings . The team later said they could not confirm claims that multiple soldiers took part in the killings . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = The ' Surge ' in southern Afghanistan = = = 
 Panjwai is the birthplace of the Taliban movement and has traditionally been a stronghold of the Taliban . It has been an area of heavy fighting and was the focus of a military surge in 2010 , which brought a more than two @-@ fold increase in airstrikes , night raids into Afghan homes , insurgent casualties , and a six @-@ fold increase in special forces operations throughout Afghanistan . Fighting in Panjwai and adjacent <unk> , <unk> and Kandahar districts was particularly intense . Conflict between the civilian population and U.S. forces was exacerbated by the wholesale destruction of some villages by American forces , mass arrests , murder of civilians by rogue units , and high casualties from improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) . 
 One of the families targeted in the Kandahar shootings had returned to the area in 2011 after previously being displaced by the surge . Fearing the Taliban but encouraged by the U.S. government , the Army , and the Afghan government , they settled near the American military base because they thought it would to be a safe place to live . 
 Approximately three weeks before the incidents , U.S. – Afghan relations were strained by an incident where copies of the Quran were burnt at the Bagram Air Base . A couple of months before the shootings , U.S. Marines were videotaped urinating on dead Taliban fighters . 
 = = = Allegations of issues at Fort Lewis = = = 
 The shooter , Robert Bales , was based at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord ( JBLM ) . The primary medical treatment facility at the base , Madigan Army Medical Center , has come under investigation for downgrading diagnoses of soldiers with PTSD to lesser ailments . Military support groups around the base have alleged that base commanders did not give returning troops sufficient time to recover before sending them on further deployments , and that the base 's medical unit is understaffed and overwhelmed by the numbers of returning veterans with deployment @-@ related medical and psychological trauma . 
 Soldiers from the base have been linked to other atrocities and crimes . The 2010 <unk> District murders involved JBLM @-@ based soldiers . Also in 2010 , a recently discharged AWOL soldier from JBLM shot a police officer in Salt Lake City . In April 2011 , a JBLM soldier killed his wife and 5 @-@ year @-@ old son before killing himself . In January 2012 , a JBLM soldier murdered a Mount Rainier National Park ranger . In two separate incidents , unrelated JBLM soldiers have been charged with waterboarding their children . 
 Jorge Gonzalez , executive director of a veterans resource center near Fort Lewis , said that the Kandahar killings offer more proof that the base is dysfunctional : " This was not a rogue soldier . JBLM is a rogue base , with a severe leadership problem " , he said in a statement . Base officials responded , saying that the crimes committed by its soldiers were isolated events which do not " reflect on the work and dedication of all service members . " Robert H. Scales , a retired U.S. Army major general and former commandant of the Army War College , suggested that the major factor in the shootings was the overuse of infantry personnel in the last ten years for close combat in Iraq , Afghanistan , and elsewhere . 
 = = = 8 March roadside bombing = = = 
 Residents of Mokhoyan , a village about 500 metres east of Camp Belamby , stated that a bomb had exploded in their vicinity on 8 March , destroying an armored vehicle and wounding several U.S. soldiers . They recounted that U.S. soldiers afterwards lined many of the male villagers against a wall , threatening to " get revenge for this incident by killing at least 20 of your people , " and threatening that " you and your children will pay for this " . One Mokhoyan resident told The Associated Press " It looked like they were going to shoot us , and I was very afraid . " American officials from The Pentagon declared that they had " no evidence " that villagers had been lined up against a wall and threatened in Mokhoyan . U.S. officials refused to confirm or deny that American soldiers were wounded outside the village on 8 March . 
 Bales ' lawyer , John Henry Browne , later stated that his client was upset because a fellow soldier had lost a leg in an explosion on 9 March . It is unclear whether the bombing cited by Browne was the same as the one described by the villagers .

 = = = Killings = = = 
 According to official reports , Bales left combat outpost Camp Belamby at 3 : 00 a.m. local time wearing night vision goggles . Bales was wearing traditional Afghan clothing over his ISAF fatigues . 
 According to government officials with knowledge of the investigation , the killings were carried out in two phases , with Bales returning to base in between . An Afghan guard reported a soldier returning to base at 1 : 30 am , and another guard reported a soldier leaving at 2 : 30 am . Bales is believed to have first gone to Alkozai , about 1 / 2 mile north of Camp <unk> , then to Najiban ( called Balandi in earlier reports ) , located 1 1 / 2 miles south of the base . Four people were killed and six wounded in Alkozai , and twelve people were killed in Najiban . American sentries at the base heard gunshots in Alkozai , but did not take action besides attempting to view Alkozai from their post inside the base . Until 22 March , U.S. authorities recognized 16 people killed , including nine children , four men , and three women . On 22 March that number was revised to 17 , but later reduced back to 16 . It was initially reported that five others were injured , and that number was eventually increased to six . 
 Four members of the same family were killed in Alkozai . According to a 16 @-@ year @-@ old boy who was shot in the leg , Bales woke up his family members before shooting them . Another witness said she saw the man drag a woman out of her house and repeatedly hit her head against a wall . 
 The first victim in Najiban appears to have been Mohammad Dawood . According to Dawood 's brother , Bales shot Dawood in the head , but spared Dawood 's wife and six children after the wife screamed at him . 
 Eleven members of Abdul Samad 's family were killed in a house in Najiban village , including his wife , four girls between the ages of two and six , four boys between eight and twelve , and two other relatives . According to a witness , " he dragged the boys by their hair and shot them in the mouth " . At least three of the child victims were killed by a single shot to the head of each . Their bodies were then set on fire . Then another civilian , Mohammad <unk> , age 55 , was killed in another house in this village . Witnesses reported that Bales was wearing a headlamp and / or a spotlight attached to his weapon . 
 Bales burned some of the victims ' bodies , an act considered desecration under Islamic law . Witnesses said that the eleven corpses from one family were shot in the head , stabbed , then gathered into one room and set on fire . A pile of ashes was found on the floor of one victims ' house ; at least one child 's body was found partially charred . A reporter for The New York Times inspected the children 's bodies taken to a nearby American military base and reported seeing burns on some of the legs and heads . 
 = = = Surrender and confession = = = 
 Following the events at Alkozai and Balandi , Bales handed himself over into ISAF custody . Afghan forces spotted him leaving his outpost before the killings and U.S. commanders on base assembled their troops for a head count when it was discovered that the soldier was missing . A patrol was dispatched to find the missing soldier , but did not find him before he returned to base after the killings . He was reportedly taken into custody without incident . There were no military operations being conducted in the area at the time of the shootings . 
 The surveillance video from the base reportedly shows " the soldier walking up to his base covered in a traditional Afghan shawl . The soldier removes the shawl and lays his weapon on the ground , then raises his arms in surrender . " The video has not been released to the public . 
 American investigators suspect that Bales may have departed the base before midnight , committed the murders in Alkozai , then returned to the base around 1 : 30 a.m. Bales may have then departed the base at 2 : 30 a.m. and committed the murders in Najiban . It was apparently the second departure which caused the alert and the commencement of the patrol to locate the missing soldier . 
 According to U.S. defense officials , upon his return to the base Bales said three words : " I did it " and then told individuals what happened . Later he retained a lawyer and refused to speak further with investigators . The United States flew Bales out of Afghanistan to Kuwait on 14 March 2012 , then to the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas on 16 March . A Pentagon spokesman said the move was done because of a " legal recommendation " . 
 = = = The number of assailants = = = 
 According to U.S. authorities , a single soldier – Staff Sergeant Robert Bales – conducted the attack . The U.S. military showed Afghan authorities the footage from the surveillance video at the base as proof that there was only one perpetrator of the shootings . 
 According to Reuters , some neighbors and relatives of the dead saw a group of U.S. soldiers arrive at their village at about 2 a.m. , enter homes and open fire . " They were all drunk and shooting all over the place , " said neighbor Agha Lala . According to The New York Times , one of the attack 's survivors and " at least five other villagers " described seeing a number of soldiers , while some other Afghan residents described seeing only one gunman . One mother @-@ of @-@ six , whose husband was killed during the incident , reported involvement of a large number of people : " When they shot dead my husband , I tried to drag him into the house ... I saw more than 20 people when I looked out the house . The Americans pointed their guns at me and threatened me , telling me not to leave the house or they 'd kill me . " An eight @-@ year @-@ old girl named <unk> , whose father was killed reported that " one man entered the room and the others were standing in the yard , holding lights . " The brother of another victim claimed his nephews and nieces had seen " numerous soldiers " with headlamps and lighted guns . Some elected officials said that they believed the attack was planned , claiming that one soldier could not have carried out such an act without help . In response , Afghan President Hamid Karzai appointed General Sher Mohammad Karimi to investigate the claims . 
 On 15 March 2012 , an Afghan parliamentary probe team made up of several members of the National Assembly of Afghanistan announced that up to 20 American soldiers were involved in the killings , with support from two helicopters . They had spent two days in the province on site , interviewing the survivors and collecting evidence . One of the members of the probe team , <unk> Lali , said : " We closely examined the site of the incident , talked to the families who lost their beloved ones , the injured people and tribal elders ... The villages are one and a half kilometre from the American military base . We are convinced that one soldier cannot kill so many people in two villages within one hour ... [ the victims ] have been killed by the two groups . " Lali asked the Afghan government , the United Nations and the international community to ensure the perpetrators were punished in Afghanistan . While visiting one of the affected villages , Hamid Karzai pointed to one of the villagers and said : " In his family , in four rooms people were killed – children and women were killed – and then they were all brought together in one room and then set on fire .

 The Army concluded that Robert Bales , a 38 @-@ year @-@ old U.S. Army staff sergeant stationed at Camp <unk> , was the only person responsible for the shootings . According to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta , immediately after being captured , Bales acknowledged the killings and " told individuals what happened " . He then asked for an attorney and refused to speak with investigators about his motivations . 
 According to officials , Bales may have been having marital problems , and the investigation of the shootings is looking into the possibility that an e @-@ mail about marriage problems might have provoked Bales . His wife wrote on her blog about her disappointment after he was passed over for a promotion to Sergeant First Class ( E @-@ 7 ) . The family was also struggling with finances , and three days before the shootings Bales ' wife put their home up for sale , as they had fallen behind with mortgage payments . 
 On 23 March 2012 , the U.S. government charged Bales with 17 counts of murder , six counts of attempted murder , and six counts of assault . On 24 March 2012 , American investigators said they believe Bales split the killings in the villages of Balandi and Alkozai into two attacks , returning to Camp Belamby after the first attack before slipping out again an hour later . No other U.S. military personnel were disciplined for having any role in the incident . 
 On 22 August 2013 , Bales pleaded guilty at his General Court @-@ martial , apologized for his killing spree , and described the massacre as an " act of cowardice . " The plea spared Bales from the death penalty . On 23 August 2013 , Bales was sentenced to life in prison without parole by the court . He was also demoted to Private ( E @-@ 1 ) , the lowest possible rank , dishonorably discharged , and ordered to forfeit all pay and allowances . A commanding general overseeing the court @-@ martial has the option of reducing the sentence to life with the possibility of parole .

 The President of Afghanistan , Hamid Karzai , called the incident " intentional murder " and stated " this [ was ] an assassination , an intentional killing of innocent civilians and cannot be forgiven .

On 16 March Karzai said the U.S. was not fully co @-@ operating with a probe into the killings . He also said the problem of civilian casualties at the hands of NATO forces " has been going on for too long ... It is by all means the end of the rope here " . A spokesperson for the Afghan Interior Ministry condemned the act " in the strongest possible terms . " 
 Afghan politicians wanted Bales to face an Afghan court . The National Assembly of Afghanistan insisted that the U.S. soldier be put on public trial in Afghanistan : " We seriously demand and expect that the government of the United States punish the culprits and try them in a public trial before the people of Afghanistan . " It also condemned the killings as " brutal and inhuman " and declared that " people are running out of patience over the ignorance of foreign forces . " Abdul Rahim <unk> , a member of parliament from Kandahar , said the shooting " gives us the message that now the American soldiers are out of the control of their generals .

On 13 March , he said , " the United States takes this as seriously as if it were our own citizens and our own children who were murdered . We ’ re heartbroken over the loss of innocent life .

 = Władysław II Jagiełło = 
 Jogaila , later Władysław II Jagiełło ( Polish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ) ( c . 1352 / 1362 – 1 June 1434 ) was Grand Duke of Lithuania ( 1377 – 1434 ) , King of Poland ( 1386 – 1399 ) alongside his wife Jadwiga , and then sole King of Poland . He ruled in Lithuania from 1377 . Born a pagan , in 1386 he converted to Catholicism and was baptized as Władysław in Kraków , married the young Queen Jadwiga , and was crowned King of Poland as Władysław II Jagiełło . In 1387 he converted Lithuania to Christianity . His own reign in Poland started in 1399 , upon death of Queen Jadwiga , and lasted a further thirty @-@ five years and laid the foundation for the centuries @-@ long Polish – Lithuanian union . He was a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty in Poland that bears his name and was previously also known as the <unk> dynasty in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . The dynasty ruled both states until 1572 , and became one of the most influential dynasties in the late medieval and early modern Central and Eastern Europe . During his reign , the Polish @-@ Lithuanian state was the largest state in the Christian world . 
 Jogaila was the last pagan ruler of medieval Lithuania . After he became King of Poland , as a result of the Union of Krewo , the newly formed Polish @-@ Lithuanian union confronted the growing power of the Teutonic Knights . The allied victory at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 , followed by the Peace of Thorn , secured the Polish and Lithuanian borders and marked the emergence of the Polish – Lithuanian alliance as a significant force in Europe . The reign of Władysław II Jagiełło extended Polish frontiers and is often considered the beginning of Poland 's Golden Age . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Lithuania = = = 
 Little is known of Jogaila 's early life , and even his year of birth is not certain . Previously historians assumed he was born in 1352 , but some recent research suggests a later date — about 1362 . He was a descendant of the Gediminid dynasty and was probably born in Vilnius . His parents were Algirdas , Grand Duke of Lithuania , and his second wife , Uliana , daughter of Alexander I , Grand Prince of Tver . 
 The Grand Duchy of Lithuania to which Jogaila succeeded as Grand Duke in 1377 was a political entity composed of two leading , but very different nationalities and two political systems : ethnic Lithuania in the north @-@ west and the vast Ruthenian territories of former Kievan Rus ' , comprising the lands of modern Ukraine , Belarus , and parts of western Russia . At first , Jogaila — like his father — based his rule in the southern and eastern territories of Lithuania , while his uncle , Kęstutis , the Duke of Trakai , continued to rule the north @-@ western region . Jogaila 's succession , however , soon placed this system of dual rule under strain . 
 At the start of his reign , Jogaila was preoccupied with unrest in the Lithuanian Rus ' lands . In 1377 – 78 , Andrei of Polotsk , the eldest son of Algirdas , challenged Jogaila 's authority and sought to become Grand Duke . In 1380 , Andrei and another brother , Dmitry , sided with Prince Dmitri of Moscow against Jogaila 's alliance with emir Mamai , de facto khan of the Golden Horde . Jogaila failed to support Mamai , lingering in the vicinity of the battlefield , which led to Mamai 's army 's significant defeat at the hands of Prince Dmitri in the Battle of Kulikovo . The Muscovites ' Pyrrhic victory over the Golden Horde , in the long term , signified , however , the beginning of a slow climb to power by the Grand Duchy of Moscow , which became within a century the most serious rival and threat to the integrity , well @-@ being and survival of Lithuania . However , in 1380 Muscovy was greatly weakened by tremendous losses suffered during the battle and thus , in the same year , Jogaila was free to begin a struggle for supremacy with Kęstutis . 
 In the north @-@ west , Lithuania faced constant armed incursions from the Teutonic Knights — founded after 1226 to fight and convert the pagan Baltic tribes of Prussians , Yotvingians and Lithuanians . In 1380 , Jogaila secretly concluded the secret Treaty of <unk> , directed against Kęstutis . When Kęstutis discovered the plan , the Lithuanian Civil War began . He seized Vilnius , overthrew Jogaila , and pronounced himself grand duke in his place . In 1382 , Jogaila raised an army from his father 's vassals and confronted Kęstutis near Trakai . Kęstutis and his son Vytautas entered Jogaila 's encampment for negotiations but were tricked and imprisoned in the Kreva Castle , where Kęstutis was found dead , probably murdered , a week later . Vytautas escaped to the Teutonic fortress of Marienburg and was baptised there under the name Wigand . 
 Jogaila formulated the Treaty of Dubysa , which rewarded the Knights for their aid in defeating Kęstutis and Vytautas by promising Christianisation and granting them Samogitia west of the Dubysa river . However , when Jogaila failed to ratify the treaty , the Knights invaded Lithuania in the summer of 1383 . In 1384 , Jogaila reconciled with Vytautas promising to return his patrimony in Trakai . Vytautas then turned against the Knights , attacking and looting several Prussian castles . 
 = = = Baptism and marriage = = = 
 Jogaila 's Russian mother Uliana of Tver urged him to marry Sofia , daughter of Prince Dmitri of Moscow , who required him first to convert to Orthodoxy . That option , however , was unlikely to halt the crusades against Lithuania by the Teutonic Knights , who regarded Orthodox Christians as schismatics and little better than heathens . Jogaila chose therefore to accept a Polish proposal to become a Catholic and marry the eleven @-@ year @-@ old Queen Jadwiga of Poland . The nobles of <unk> made this offer to Jogaila for many reasons . They wanted to neutralize the dangers posed by Lithuania itself and to secure the fertile territories of Galicia – Volhynia . The Polish nobles saw the offer as an opportunity for increasing their privileges and avoiding Austrian influence , brought by Jadwiga 's previous fiancé William , Duke of Austria . 
 On 14 August 1385 in Kreva Castle , Jogaila confirmed his prenuptial promises in the Union of Krewo ( Union of Kreva ) . The promises included the adoption of Christianity , repatriation of lands " stolen " from Poland by its neighbours , and <unk> <unk> <unk> et Russiae Coronae Regni Poloniae perpetuo <unk> , a clause interpreted by historians to mean anything from a personal union between Lithuania and Poland to a complete incorporation of Lithuania into Poland . The agreement at Kreva has been described both as far @-@ sighted and as a desperate gamble . 
 Jogaila was duly baptised at the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków on 15 February 1386 and from then on formally used the name Władysław or Latin versions of it . The marriage took place three days later , and on 4 March 1386 Jogaila was crowned King Władysław by archbishop <unk> . He was also to be legally adopted by Jadwiga 's mother , Elizabeth of Bosnia , so retaining the throne in the event of Jadwiga 's death . The royal baptism triggered the conversion of most of Jogaila 's court and noblemen , as well as mass baptisms in Lithuanian rivers , a beginning of the final Christianization of Lithuania . Though the ethnic Lithuanian nobility were the main converts to Catholicism — both paganism and the Orthodox rite remained strong among the peasants — the king 's conversion and its political implications created lasting repercussions for the history of both Lithuania and Poland . 
 = = Ruler of Lithuania and Poland = = 
 = = = Accession = = = 
 Władysław II Jagiello and Queen Jadwiga reigned as co @-@ monarchs ; and though Jadwiga probably had little real power , she took an active part in Poland 's political and cultural life . In 1387 , she led two successful military expeditions to Red Ruthenia , recovered lands her father Louis I of Hungary had transferred from Poland to Hungary , and secured the homage of Petru I , Voivode of Moldavia . In 1390 , she also personally opened negotiations with the Teutonic Order . Most political responsibilities , however , fell to Jagiello , with Jadwiga attending to the cultural and charitable activities for which she is still revered . 
 Soon after Jagiello 's accession to the Polish throne , Jagiello granted Vilnius a city charter like that of Kraków , modeled on the Magdeburg Law ; and Vytautas issued a privilege to a Jewish commune of Trakai on almost the same terms as privileges issued to the Jews of Poland in the reigns of Boleslaus the Pious and Casimir the Great . Władysław 's policy of unifying the two legal systems was partial and uneven at first but achieved a lasting influence . By the time of the Union of Lublin in 1569 , there was not much difference between the administrative and judicial systems in force in Lithuania and Poland . 
 One effect of Jagiello 's measures was to be the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements ; in 1387 and 1413 , for example , Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars . As this process gained momentum , it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus ' and Lithuanian identity in the fifteenth century . 
 = = = Challenges = = = 
 Jagiello 's baptism failed to end the crusade of the Teutonic Knights , who claimed his conversion was a sham , perhaps even a heresy , and renewed their incursions on the pretext that pagans remained in Lithuania . From then on , however , the Order found it harder to sustain the cause of a crusade and faced the growing threat to its existence posed by the Kingdom of Poland and a genuinely Christian Lithuania alliance . Władysław sponsored the creation of the diocese of Vilnius under bishop Andrzej <unk> , the former confessor of Elisabeth of Hungary . The bishopric , which included Samogitia , then largely controlled by the Teutonic Order , was subordinated to the see of Gniezno and not to that of Teutonic Königsberg . The decision may not have improved Władysław 's relations with the Order , but it served to introduce closer ties between Lithuania and Poland , enabling the Polish church to freely assist its Lithuanian counterpart . 
 In 1389 , Władysław 's rule in Lithuania faced a revived challenge from Vytautas , who resented the power given to Skirgaila in Lithuania at the expense of his own patrimony . Vytautas started a civil war in Lithuania , aiming to become the Grand Duke . On 4 September 1390 , the joint forces of Vytautas and the Teutonic Grand Master , Konrad von Wallenrode , laid siege to Vilnius , which was held by Władysław 's regent Skirgaila with combined Polish , Lithuanian and Ruthenian troops . Although the Knights lifted the siege of the castle after a month , they reduced much of the outer city to ruins . This bloody conflict was eventually brought to a temporary halt in 1392 with the Treaty of Ostrów , by which Władysław handed over the government of Lithuania to his cousin in exchange for peace : Vytautas was to rule Lithuania as the Grand Duke ( magnus dux ) until his death , under the overlordship of the Supreme Duke ( dux supremus ) in the person of the Polish monarch . Skirgaila was moved from the Duchy of Trakai to become prince of Kiev . Vytautas initially accepted his status but soon began to pursue Lithuania 's independence from Poland . 
 The protracted period of war between the Lithuanians and the Teutonic Knights was ended on 12 October 1398 by the Treaty of <unk> , named after the islet in the Neman River where it was signed . Lithuania agreed to cede Samogitia and assist the Teutonic Order in a campaign to seize Pskov , while the Order agreed to assist Lithuania in a campaign to seize Novgorod . Shortly afterwards , Vytautas was crowned as a king by local nobles ; but the following year his forces and those of his ally , Khan Tokhtamysh of the White Horde , were crushed by the <unk> at the Battle of the Vorskla River , ending his imperial ambitions in the east and obliging him to submit to Władysław 's protection once more .

 On 22 June 1399 , Jadwiga gave birth to a daughter , baptised Elizabeth <unk> , but within a month the mother and daughter died , leaving Władysław sole ruler of the Kingdom of Poland and without an heir nor much legitimacy to rule the kingdom . Jadwiga 's death undermined Władysław 's right to the throne , and as a result old conflicts between the nobility of Lesser Poland , generally sympathetic to Władysław , and the gentry of Greater Poland began to surface . In 1402 , Władysław answered the rumblings against his rule by marrying Anna of Celje , a granddaughter of Casimir III of Poland , a political match that re @-@ legitimised his reign . 
 The Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401 confirmed the status of Vytautas as grand duke under Władysław 's overlordship , while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of Władysław rather than those of Vytautas : should Władysław die without heirs , the Lithuanian boyars were to elect a new monarch . Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch , the implications of the union were unforeseeable , but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent defensive alliance between the two states , strengthening Lithuania 's hand for a new war against the Teutonic Order in which Poland officially took no part . While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched , it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania , whose grand dukes had till then been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy . The Union of Vilnius and Radom therefore earned Władysław a measure of support in Lithuania . 
 In late 1401 , the new war against the Order overstretched the resources of the Lithuanians , who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces . Another of Władysław 's brothers , the <unk> Švitrigaila , chose this moment to stir up revolts behind the lines and declare himself grand duke . On 31 January 1402 , he presented himself in Marienburg , where he won the backing of the Knights with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy . 
 = = = Against the Teutonic Order = = = 
 The war ended in the Treaty of Raciąż on 22 May 1404 . Władysław acceded to the formal cession of Samogitia and agreed to support the Order 's designs on Pskov ; in return , Konrad von Jungingen undertook to sell Poland the disputed Dobrzyń Land and the town of <unk> , once pawned to the Order by Władysław <unk> , and to support Vytautas in a revived attempt on Novgorod . Both sides had practical reasons for signing the treaty at that point : the Order needed time to fortify its newly acquired lands , the Poles and Lithuanians to deal with territorial challenges in the east and in Silesia . 
 Also in 1404 , Władysław held talks at Vratislav with Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia , who offered to return Silesia to Poland if Władysław supported him in his power struggle within the Holy Roman Empire . Władysław turned the deal down with the agreement of both Polish and Silesian nobles , unwilling to burden himself with new military commitments in the west . 
 = = = Polish – Lithuanian – Teutonic war = = = 
 In December 1408 , Władysław and Vytautas held strategic talks in Navahrudak Castle , where they decided to foment a Samogitian uprising against Teutonic rule to draw German forces away from Pomerelia . Władysław promised to repay Vytautas for his support by restoring Samogitia to Lithuania in any future peace treaty . The uprising , which began in May 1409 , at first provoked little reaction from the Knights , who had not yet consolidated their rule in Samogitia by building castles ; but by June their diplomats were busy lobbying Władysław 's court at <unk> , warning his nobles against Polish involvement in a war between Lithuania and the Order . Władysław , however , bypassed his nobles and informed new Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen that if the Knights acted to suppress Samogitia , Poland would intervene . This stung the Order into issuing a declaration of war against Poland on 6 August , which Władysław received on 14 August in Nowy <unk> . 
 The castles guarding the northern border were in such bad condition that the Knights easily captured those at <unk> , Dobrzyń and Bobrowniki , the capital of Dobrzyń Land , while German burghers invited them into Bydgoszcz ( German : Bromberg ) . Władysław arrived on the scene in late September , retook Bydgoszcz within a week , and came to terms with the Order on 8 October . During the winter , the two armies prepared for a major confrontation . Władysław installed a strategic supply depot at Płock in Masovia and had a pontoon bridge constructed and transported north down the Vistula . 
 Meanwhile , both sides unleashed diplomatic offensives . The Knights dispatched letters to the monarchs of Europe , preaching their usual crusade against the heathens ; Władysław countered with his own letters to the monarchs , accusing the Order of planning to conquer the whole world . Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights to each side . Wenceslas IV of Bohemia signed a defensive treaty with the Poles against the Teutonic Order ; his brother , Sigismund of Luxembourg , allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July , though his Hungarian vassals refused his call to arms .

 When the war resumed in June 1410 , Władysław advanced into the Teutonic heartland at the head of an army of about 20 @,@ 000 mounted nobles , 15 @,@ 000 armed commoners , and 2 @,@ 000 professional cavalry mainly hired from Bohemia . After crossing the Vistula over the pontoon bridge at <unk> , his troops met up with those of Vytautas , whose 11 @,@ 000 light cavalry included Lithuanians , Ruthenians , and Tatars . The Teutonic Order 's army numbered about 18 @,@ 000 cavalry , mostly Germans and 5 @,@ 000 infantry . On 15 July , at the Battle of Grunwald after one of the largest and most ferocious battles of the Middle Ages , the allies won a victory so overwhelming that the Teutonic Order 's army was virtually annihilated , with most of its key commanders killed in combat , including Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen and Grand Marshal Friedrich von Wallenrode . Thousands of troops were reported to have been slaughtered on either side . 
 The road to the Teutonic capital Marienburg now lay open , the city undefended ; but for reasons the sources do not explain , Władysław hesitated to pursue his advantage . On 17 July , his army began a laboured advance , arriving at Marienburg only on 25 July , by which time the new Grand Master , Heinrich von Plauen , had organised a defence of the fortress . The apparent half @-@ heartedness of the ensuing siege , called off by Władysław on 19 September , has been ascribed variously to the impregnability of the fortifications , to high casualty figures among the Lithuanians , to Władysław 's unwillingness to risk further casualties , or to his desire to keep the Order weakened but undefeated as to not upset the balance of power between Poland ( which would most likely acquire most of the Order possessions if it was totally defeated ) and Lithuania ; but a lack of sources precludes a definitive explanation . 
 = = = Dissent = = = 
 The war ended in 1411 with the Peace of Thorn , in which neither Poland nor Lithuania drove home their negotiating advantage to the full , much to the discontent of the Polish nobles . Poland regained Dobrzyń Land , Lithuania regained Samogitia , and Masovia regained a small territory beyond the Wkra river . Most of the Teutonic Order 's territory , however , including towns that had surrendered , remained intact . Władysław then proceeded to release many high @-@ ranking Teutonic Knights and officials for apparently modest ransoms . The cumulative expense of the ransoms , however , proved a drain on the Order 's resources . This failure to exploit the victory to his nobles ' satisfaction provoked growing opposition to Władysław 's regime after 1411 , further fuelled by the granting of Podolia , disputed between Poland and Lithuania , to Vytautas , and by the king 's two @-@ year absence in Lithuania . 
 In an effort to outflank his critics , Władysław promoted the leader of the opposing faction , bishop Mikołaj <unk> , to the archbishopric of Gniezno in autumn 1411 and replaced him in Kraków with Wojciech <unk> , a supporter of Vytautas . He also sought to create more allies in Lithuania . In the Union of <unk> , signed on 2 October 1413 , he decreed that the status of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was " tied to our Kingdom of Poland permanently and irreversibly " and granted the Catholic nobles of Lithuania privileges equal to those of the Polish szlachta . The act included a clause prohibiting the Polish nobles from electing a monarch without the consent of the Lithuanian nobles , and the Lithuanian nobles from electing a grand duke without the consent of the Polish monarch . 
 = = = Last conflicts = = = 
 In 1414 , a sporadic new war broke out , known as the " Hunger War " from the Knights ' scorched @-@ earth tactics of burning fields and mills ; but both the Knights and the Lithuanians were too exhausted from the previous war to risk a major battle , and the fighting petered out in the autumn . Hostilities did not flare up again until 1419 , during the Council of Constance , when they were called off at the papal legate 's insistence . 
 The Council of Constance proved a turning point in the Teutonic crusades , as it did for several European conflicts . Vytautas sent a delegation in 1415 , including the metropolitan of Kiev and Samogitian witnesses ; they arrived at Constance at the end of that year to express their preference for being " baptised with water and not with blood " . The Polish envoys , among them Mikołaj <unk> , Zawisza Czarny , and Paweł <unk> , lobbied for an end to the forced conversion of heathens and to the Order 's aggression against Lithuania and Poland . As a result of the Polish – Lithuanian diplomacy , the council , though scandalised by <unk> 's questioning of the legitimacy of the monastic state , denied the Order 's request for a further crusade and instead entrusted the conversion of the Samogitians to Poland – Lithuania . 
 The diplomatic context at Constance included the revolt of the Bohemian Hussites , who looked upon Poland as an ally in their wars against Sigismund , the emperor elect and new king of Bohemia . In 1421 , the Bohemian Diet declared Sigismund deposed and formally offered the crown to Władysław on condition that he accept the religious principles of the Four Articles of Prague , which he was not prepared to do . After Władysław 's refusal , Vytautas was postulated ( elected in absentia ) as Bohemian king , but he assured the pope that he opposed the heretics . Between 1422 and 1428 , Władysław 's nephew , Sigismund Korybut , attempted a regency in war @-@ torn Bohemia , with little success . Vytautas accepted Sigismund 's offer of a royal crown in 1429 — apparently with Władysław 's blessing — but Polish forces intercepted the crown in transit and the coronation was cancelled . 
 In 1422 , Władysław fought another war , known as the <unk> War , against the Teutonic Order , defeating them in under two months before the Order 's imperial reinforcements had time to arrive . The resulting Treaty of Melno ended the Knights ' claims to Samogitia once and for all and defined a permanent border between Prussia and Lithuania . Lithuania was given the province of Samogitia , with the port of Palanga , but the city of Klaipėda was left to the Order . This border remained largely unchanged for roughly 500 years , until 1920 . The terms of this treaty have , however , been seen as turning a Polish victory into defeat , as a result of Władysław 's renunciation of Polish claims to Pomerania , Pomerelia , and Chełmno Land , for which he received only the town of Nieszawa in return . The Treaty of Melno closed a chapter in the Knights ' wars with Lithuania but did little to settle their long @-@ term issues with Poland . Further sporadic warfare broke out between Poland and the Knights between 1431 and 1435 . 
 Cracks in the cooperation between Poland and Lithuania after the death of Vytautas in 1430 had offered the Knights a revived opportunity for interference in Poland . Władysław supported his brother Švitrigaila as grand duke of Lithuania , but when Švitrigaila , with the support of the Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus ' nobles , rebelled against Polish overlordship in Lithuania , the Poles , under the leadership of Bishop Zbigniew <unk> of Kraków , occupied Podolia , which Władysław had awarded to Lithuania in 1411 , and Volhynia . In 1432 , a pro @-@ Polish party in Lithuania elected Vytautas 's brother <unk> as grand duke , leading to an armed struggle over the Lithuanian succession which stuttered on for years after Władysław 's death . 
 = = = Succession = = = 
 Władysław 's second wife , Anna of Celje , had died in 1416 , leaving a daughter , Jadwiga . In 1417 , Władysław married Elisabeth of <unk> , who died in 1420 without bearing him a child , and two years later , Sophia of <unk> , who bore him two surviving sons . The death in 1431 of Princess Jadwiga , the last heir of Piast blood , released Władysław to make his sons by Sophia of <unk> his heirs , though he had to sweeten the Polish nobles with concessions to ensure their agreement , since the monarchy was elective . Władysław finally died in 1434 , leaving Poland to his elder son , Władysław III , and Lithuania to his younger , Casimir , both still minors at the time . The Lithuanian inheritance , however , could not be taken for granted . His death in 1434 ended the personal union between the two realms , and it was not clear what would take its place .

 The Kawachi class ( <unk> , Kawachi @-@ gata senkan ) was a two @-@ ship class of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) in the first decade of the 20th century . Both ships bombarded German fortifications at Tsingtao during the Battle of Tsingtao in 1914 , but saw no other combat in World War I. Kawachi sank in 1918 after an explosion in her ammunition magazine with the loss of over 600 officers and crewmen . Settsu was disarmed in 1922 and converted into a target ship two years later to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and served until she was sunk in 1945 by American carrier aircraft . The ship was refloated after the war and scrapped in 1946 – 47 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Kawachi class was ordered on 22 June 1907 under the 1907 Warship Supplement Program after the Russo @-@ Japanese War as Japan 's first dreadnoughts , although their construction was delayed by a severe depression . They were one of the first steps in the fulfillment of the recently adopted Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program that required a fleet of eight dreadnoughts and armored cruisers . Their design was based on the Aki with a uniform 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) main @-@ gun armament in the hexagonal layout used by the German dreadnoughts of the Nassau and Helgoland classes . 
 The first iteration of the design had six twin @-@ gun turrets , with two pairs of superfiring turrets fore and aft of the superstructure and the two other turrets amidships " en echelon " to maximize end @-@ on fire . This layout was rejected as it exceeded the informal 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) limit . The design was then revised with the turrets in the hexagonal layout using the same 45 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ inch guns used in the preceding battleships . In early 1908 , the IJN received reports that the Royal Navy 's latest battleships used longer 50 @-@ caliber guns . The Chief of the Naval General Staff , Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō , pushed to use these guns ; cost considerations prevented all the guns from having the same barrel length , so they were used only in the fore and aft turrets . 
 = = Description = = 
 The two ships had different bow designs for comparison purposes ; Settsu 's clipper bow was longer than Kawachi 's vertical stem . Otherwise the two ships were externally virtually identical . The ships had an overall length of 526 – 533 feet ( 160 @.@ 3 – 162 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 84 feet 3 inches ( 25 @.@ 7 m ) , and a normal draft of 27 – 27 @.@ 8 feet ( 8 @.@ 2 – 8 @.@ 5 m ) . They displaced 20 @,@ 823 – 21 @,@ 443 long tons ( 21 @,@ 157 – 21 @,@ 787 t ) at normal load and had a metacentric height of 5 feet 3 inches ( 1 @.@ 59 m ) . Their crew ranged from 999 to 1100 officers and enlisted men . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Kawachi @-@ class vessels were fitted with a pair of license @-@ built Curtis steam turbine sets , each set driving one propeller , using steam from 16 Miyabara water @-@ tube boilers with a working pressure of 17 @.@ 5 bar ( 1 @,@ 750 kPa ; 254 psi ) . The turbines were rated at a total of 25 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 19 @,@ 000 kW ) for a design speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . During testing , the turbines of both ships proved to be significantly more powerful than designed , 30 @,@ 399 shp ( 22 @,@ 669 kW ) for Kawachi and 32 @,@ 200 shp ( 24 @,@ 000 kW ) for Settsu , although the speeds attained on sea trials are unknown . The ships carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 300 long tons ( 2 @,@ 300 t ) of coal and 400 long tons ( 410 t ) of fuel oil which gave them a range of 2 @,@ 700 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 000 km ; 3 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The Kawachi class carried four 50 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ inch guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . Settsu 's guns were ordered from Vickers and Kawachi 's were built in Japan . The fore and aft turrets could each traverse 270 ° . They fired 850 @-@ pound ( 386 kg ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 3 @,@ 000 ft / s ( 910 m / s ) ; this gave a maximum range of 24 @,@ 000 yards ( 22 @,@ 000 m ) . The eight 45 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ inch 41st Year Type were mounted in four twin @-@ gun wing turrets , two on each side . Each turret could traverse 160 ° . The 45 @-@ caliber guns fired the same shell as the longer guns , although muzzle velocity was reduced to 2 @,@ 800 ft / s ( 850 m / s ) and range to 21 @,@ 872 yards ( 20 @,@ 000 m ) . Each 12 @-@ inch gun was provided with 80 rounds , normally loaded at an elevation of + 5 ° , although they could be loaded at any angle up to + 13 ° . The guns had an elevation range of -5 ° to + 25 ° . 
 Their secondary armament consisted of ten 45 @-@ caliber 6 @-@ inch 41st Year Type guns , mounted in casemates in the sides of the hull , and eight 40 @-@ caliber quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch 41st Year Type guns . The 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) gun fired a 100 @-@ pound ( 45 kg ) AP shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 706 ft / s ( 825 m / s ) and the ships carried 150 rounds for each gun . The shell of the 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) gun weighed 45 pounds ( 20 @.@ 4 kg ) and was fired at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 150 ft / s ( 660 m / s ) . Each gun was also provided with 150 rounds . 
 The ships were also equipped with a dozen 40 @-@ caliber QF 3 @-@ inch 41st Year Type guns for defense against torpedo boats and four shorter 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) guns were used as saluting guns or mounted on the ships ' boats . Both of these guns fired 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 67 kg ) shells with muzzle velocities of 2 @,@ 300 ft / s ( 700 m / s ) and 1 @,@ 500 feet per second ( 450 m / s ) respectively . They carried a total of 1 @,@ 200 rounds for the longer guns and another 1 @,@ 200 for the shorter guns . 
 In addition , they were fitted with five submerged 18 @-@ inch ( 457 mm ) torpedo tubes , two on each broadside and one in the stern . Two of the ships ' boats could carry torpedoes and the ships carried a total of 24 Type 43 torpedoes . These had a 209 @-@ pound ( 95 kg ) warhead and a maximum range of 5 @,@ 500 yards ( 5 @,@ 000 m ) at a speed of 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) .

 The waterline main belt of the Kawachi @-@ class ships consisted of Krupp cemented armor that had a maximum thickness of 12 inches ( 305 mm ) amidships and tapered to a thickness of 5 inches ( 127 mm ) inches at the ends of the ship . Approximately 6 feet 4 inches ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) of the belt was above the waterline and 6 feet 5 inches ( 1 @.@ 95 m ) below it . Above the belt was a strake of armor 8 inches ( 203 mm ) thick that covered the side of the hull up to the height of the middle deck . Above that was a 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) strake that protected the casemates . The barbettes for the main guns were 11 inches ( 280 mm ) thick above the weather deck and 9 inches ( 229 mm ) below it . The armor of all the 12 @-@ inch gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 11 inches with a 3 @-@ inch roof . The deck armor was 1 @.@ 1 inches ( 29 mm ) thick and the conning tower was protected by 10 inches ( 254 mm ) of armor .

 Following the Japanese ship @-@ naming conventions , Kawachi and Settsu were named after ancient Japanese provinces , both now a part of Osaka prefecture . The only significant action performed by either ship during World War I was when they bombarded German fortifications in October – November 1914 during the final stage of the Battle of Tsingtao . They were both assigned to the First Squadron until they were refitted in 1917 and 1916 respectively . Upon their completion of their refits , both ships were assigned to the Second Squadron . On 12 July 1918 , Kawachi was sunk in an accidental magazine explosion in Tokuyama Bay that killed over 600 crewmen . Stricken from the Navy List on 21 September 1918 , the wreck was later partially dismantled although most of the hull was abandoned in place to serve as an artificial reef . 
 Settsu was reassigned to the First Squadron later that month . By this time , the dozen 40 @-@ caliber 3 @-@ inch 4th Year Type guns had been removed and four 3 @-@ inch anti @-@ aircraft guns were added . Two of the torpedo tubes were also removed . The ship served as the flagship for Emperor Taishō for the naval reviews held in 1918 and 1919 . She was placed in reserve in late 1919 and reboilered during an overhaul that lasted until 1921 . Settsu was disarmed in 1922 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and stricken from the Navy List on 1 October 1923 . The following year , the ship was converted into a target ship with her armor reinforced to withstand hits . 
 In 1935 – 1937 , the ship was converted to radio @-@ control which allowed her to be maneuvered by operators aboard another ship and additional armor was added . At the beginning of the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War in 1937 , she transported a battalion of naval troops to the Shanghai area . Settsu simulated the radio traffic of eight aircraft carriers at the beginning of the Pacific War in an effort to deceive Allied intelligence as to the locations and activities of the Japanese carriers . For the rest of the war she served as a target for carrier pilots . Settsu was badly damaged when Allied carrier aircraft attacked the IJN base at Kure in July 1945 and was forced to beach herself lest she sink . The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 20 November and her hulk was raised and broken up in 1946 – 1947 . 
 = HMS Escort ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Escort was an E @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s . Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion , the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935 – 36 , during the Abyssinia Crisis . During the Spanish Civil War of 1936 – 1939 , she spent considerable time in Spanish waters , enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict . Escort was assigned to convoy escort and anti @-@ submarine patrol duties in the Western Approaches , when World War II began in September 1939 . During the Norwegian Campaign , the ship escorted ships of the Home Fleet , although she did tow her sister HMS Eclipse after the latter ship had been badly damaged by German air attack . Escort was assigned to Force H in late June , and participated in the Attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir in early July . She was torpedoed a few days later , by an Italian submarine , but was towed for three days towards Gibraltar before she foundered . 
 = = Description = = 
 The E @-@ class ships were slightly improved versions of the preceding D class . They displaced 1 @,@ 405 long tons ( 1 @,@ 428 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 940 long tons ( 1 @,@ 970 t ) at deep load . The ships had an overall length of 329 feet ( 100 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 33 feet 3 inches ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam provided by three Admiralty three @-@ drum boilers . The turbines developed a total of 36 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 35 @.@ 5 knots ( 65 @.@ 7 km / h ; 40 @.@ 9 mph ) . Escort carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 6 @,@ 350 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 760 km ; 7 @,@ 310 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ships ' complement was 145 officers and ratings . 
 The ships mounted four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) Mark IX guns in single mounts . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , they had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . The E class was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . 
 = = Service = = 
 Escort was ordered from Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company , at Greenock , Scotland on 1 November 1932 , under the 1931 Construction Programme . She was laid down on 30 March 1933 , and launched on 29 March 1934 . She was commissioned on 30 October 1934 , at a total cost of £ 249 @,@ 587 , excluding government @-@ furnished equipment like the armament . Upon commissioning the ship was assigned to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet , aside from a brief deployment in the West Indies between January and March 1935 . Afterwards , she was refitted in Sheerness from 27 March to 30 April . Escort was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet from September 1935 to March 1936 , during the Abyssinian Crisis . She struck a lock while at Sheerness and required seven weeks of repairs that were not completed until 5 September . The ship patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War , enforcing the edicts of the Non @-@ Intervention Committee until 24 March 1939 , when she returned to the United Kingdom . Escort became tender to the light cruiser HMS Caledon of the Reserve Fleet upon her return , and was not recommissioned until 2 August , when she was assigned to the 12th Destroyer Flotilla . 
 On 3 September , Escort and her sister HMS Electra rescued some 300 @-@ odd survivors from the ocean liner SS Athenia , which had been torpedoed by the German submarine U @-@ 30 . The ship was assigned to convoy escort and anti @-@ submarine duties in the Western Approaches Command . She was transferred to Rosyth in December , for similar duties in the North Sea . Escort was refitted at Falmouth between 10 January and 12 February 1940 , and resumed her duties afterwards . Together with the destroyers HMS Inglefield and HMS Imogen , she sank the German submarine U @-@ 63 on 25 February , after the German vessel had been spotted by the submarine HMS Narwhal some 90 miles ( 140 km ) east of the Orkney Islands . 
 When the Norwegian Campaign began in early April , Escort was transferred to the Home Fleet , and was screening the capital ships when they sortied into the North Sea looking for the German ship on 9 April . After her sister Eclipse was damaged by air attack on 11 April , Escort towed her to Sullom Voe . The ship escorted the aircraft carriers HMS Glorious and HMS Ark Royal from 25 April , as their aircraft attacked German targets in Norway . She accompanied Glorious when that ship returned to Scapa Flow to refuel and replenish her aircraft on 27 April . The ship was slightly damaged in a collision with the Polish ocean liner Chrobry on 11 May . Escort was based in Scapa Flow as part of the Home Fleet until 26 June , when she sailed for Gibraltar to join Force H. It is uncertain if her rear set of torpedo tubes were replaced by a 3 @-@ inch ( 76 @.@ 2 mm ) ( 12 @-@ pounder ) AA gun at this time . She arrived on 2 July , and joined Force H in attacking ships of the French Navy at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir the next day . During Operation MA 5 , a planned air attack on Italian airfields in Sardinia , Escort was torpedoed by the Italian submarine Guglielmo Marconi on 11 July after the attack had been cancelled due to lack of surprise . The torpedo blew a hole 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide between the two boiler rooms , but only killed two members of the crew . Later that morning she foundered . 
 = Typhoon Pamela ( 1976 ) = 
 Typhoon Pamela was a powerful typhoon that struck the U.S. territory of Guam in May 1976 , causing about $ 500 million in damage ( USD ) . The sixth named storm and third typhoon of the 1976 Pacific typhoon season , Pamela developed on May 14 from a trough in the Federated States of Micronesia in the area of the Nomoi Islands . It executed a counterclockwise loop and slowly intensified , bringing heavy rains to the islands in the region . Ten people died on Chuuk due to a landslide . After beginning a steady northwest motion toward Guam , Pamela attained its peak winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) . 
 On May 21 , the large eye of the typhoon crossed Guam , producing typhoon @-@ force winds ( greater than 118 km / h or 73 mph ) for a period of 18 hours . An estimated 80 % of the buildings on the island were damaged to some degree , including 3 @,@ 300 houses that were destroyed . Pamela 's slow motion produced 856 mm ( 33 @.@ 7 in ) of rainfall , making May 1976 the wettest on record in Guam . Despite the high damage , well @-@ executed warnings kept the death toll to only one . After affecting the island , the typhoon weakened and turned northeastward , passing near Iwo Jima before becoming an extratropical cyclone . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Typhoon Pamela were from a tropical disturbance that persisted in the eastern end of the equatorial trough on May 13 . At the time , it was located about 425 km ( 265 mi ) north of Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia . The disturbance was initially difficult to locate as it tracked generally to the south and southwest , a motion caused by a southward @-@ moving tropical upper tropospheric trough . On May 14 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) indicated that the system developed into a tropical cyclone . That same day , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) followed suit and classified it as Tropical Depression <unk> . The next day , data from the Typhoon Chasers indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Pamela . It was able to intensify after the trough receded northward , developing outflow . The storm turned to the south and east , gradually executing a counterclockwise loop through the FSM . This was due to a building ridge between Pamela and Typhoon Olga to its west . On May 16 , observations from Satawan in the Caroline Islands indicated that Pamela attained typhoon status , which is a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of at least 118 km / h ( 74 mph ) . This was confirmed the next day by the Typhoon Chasers . 
 Upon attaining typhoon status , Pamela was a small tropical cyclone with a central dense overcast spanning 280 km ( 175 mi ) in diameter . After completing its counterclockwise loop , the typhoon began a slow motion to the northwest , once the ridge to its west diminished . On May 18 , it passed within 95 km ( 60 mi ) of Chuuk , and around that time Pamela developed a circular eye about 18 km ( 12 mi ) in diameter . The typhoon steadily intensified as it began a more steady northwest movement due to a ridge to its east , and on May 19 Pamela attained peak winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) about 485 km ( 300 mi ) southeast of Guam . At that time , it had gusts to 295 km / h ( 185 mph ) . 
 Typhoon Pamela maintained peak intensity for about 18 hours , during which the Typhoon Chasers reported an atmospheric pressure of 921 millibars ( 27 @.@ 2 inHg ) ; the aircraft also reported concentric eyewalls . The JMA estimated the minimum pressure was slightly lower at 920 millibars ( 27 inHg ) . A trough passing to its north caused the typhoon to turn more to the north @-@ northwest . Around 0400 UTC on May 21 , the eyewall of Pamela struck southeastern Guam with winds of about 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) . Over a three @-@ hour period , the 37 km ( 23 mi ) wide eye crossed the island . After leaving the island , Pamela continued steadily northwestward for two days while maintaining its intensity . On May 23 , it turned to the north and northeast due to a break in the subtropical ridge . The typhoon passed 28 km ( 17 mi ) east of Iwo Jima with winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . As Pamela accelerated over cooler waters and into an area of higher wind shear , it rapidly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm on May 25 . The next day , the storm became extratropical , which lasted until June 1 before dissipating over the Bering Sea . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Pamela first presented a threat to Guam on May 16 when it first attained typhoon status . All subsequent forecasts anticipated the typhoon would pass within 185 km ( 115 mi ) . In response to Pamela 's approach , Guam was placed under Typhoon Condition of Readiness III ( TCCOR 3 ) on May 18 . This was upgrade to TCCOR II on later that day , and TCCOR I the next day . The Navy and Air Force evacuated assets . Before the typhoon 's arrival , officials advised residents to store water prior to the storm 's arrival . About 2 @,@ 100 people in vulnerable wooden homes were evacuated to storm shelters set up in schools and public offices . 
 = = = Chuuk islands = = = 
 While passing between the <unk> and <unk> atolls in the Mortlock Islands , Pamela produced winds of over 102 km / h ( 63 mph ) . Different communities experienced differing levels of damage from the storm . The islands of Etal , <unk> , and <unk> received the most damage as storm waves submerged these islands for over 15 to 18 hours . Across these islands , the typhoon left heavy crop and reef damage . Islands such as Satawan and Lukunor received more moderate damage from the storm . No deaths were reported in the Morlock Islands . 
 From May 17 to 18 , at the Weather Service on Chuuk , Pamela dumped 14 @.@ 59 in ( 371 mm ) of rain . The rains resulted in mudslide that killed 10 people on Moen , many of whom lived in a single buried house ; several people were also injured . Winds reached 91 km / h ( 56 km / h ) . 
 = = = Mariana Islands = = = 
 The typhoon produced tropical @-@ storm force gusts and 10 in ( 250 mm ) of rain on Saipan . The impact there was minor . 
 While slowly crossing Guam , Pamela produced winds of over 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) across the entire island over a six @-@ hour period , causing widespread heavy damage . Typhoon @-@ force winds were reported for 18 hours , and tropical storm @-@ force winds were reported for 30 hours . As the eye was crossing the island , the winds rapidly vacillated between gusts of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) to calmness in the span of a few minutes ; this created a large pressure gradient that caused additional damage . The typhoon dropped a total of 856 mm ( 33 @.@ 7 in ) of rainfall , including 690 mm ( 27 in ) in a 24 @-@ hour period , on the island . This contributed to May 1976 being Guam 's wettest month on record . 
 In Apra Harbor , ten ships or tugs were sunk , as were numerous smaller vessels . One of the ships that survived in the harbor was the cutter Basswood of the Coast Guard , which recorded a wind gust of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) . Pamela 's damage prevented regular flights in and out of the island . 
 The typhoon left extensive damage to military and civilian properties on the island , estimated at around $ 500 million ( 1976 USD ) . Trees were also uprooted throughout the island . Although Pamela was not as strong as Typhoon Karen in 1962 , it proved more costly due to its slow movement . Concrete buildings largely survived the storm , but power lines and wooden structures were devastated . The typhoon cut off all public utilities on the island as well as Guam 's two radio stations . The American Red Cross estimated that Pamela destroyed 3 @,@ 300 houses and significantly damaged another 3 @,@ 200 . Government officials preliminarily estimated that 80 % of the buildings were damaged to some degree , of which half were destroyed . Overall , 14 @,@ 000 families sustained damage during the storm . About 300 people on the island were injured , and although the Red Cross reported three fatalities , the JTWC reported only one death in Guam in the year @-@ end report . The low death total was attributed to timely warnings and forecasts . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The disruption on Guam was significant enough that the JTWC 's backup location at Yokota Air Base in Japan assumed forecasting and warning responsibilities for five days starting on May 20 . The cleanup and recovery took months , assisted by military personnel . During the aftermath , food shortages resulted in long lines for aid at Andersen Air Force Base . Due to Pamela as well as the occurrence of other disasters in 1976 , the American Red Cross went into debt , after providing about $ 10 million in assistance to 16 @,@ 000 families . The agency set up 29 shelters for 2 @,@ 600 people . 
 On May 22 , a day after the typhoon struck the island , U.S. President Gerald Ford declared Guam a major disaster area . In September 1976 , the United States Senate passed a bill that included aid for the storm victims . Ultimately , the U.S. government provided $ 200 million in aid and reconstruction funding in the two years following the typhoon 's passage . This included about $ 80 million to repair Guam 's military facilities , which took several years to complete . Following the typhoon 's passage and through the 1980s , the island 's wooden homes underwent the process of being replaced by safer concrete homes . 
 = District Railway = 
 The Metropolitan District Railway ( commonly known as the District Railway ) was a passenger railway that served London from 1868 to 1933 . Established in 1864 to complete the inner circle , an underground railway in London , the first part of the line opened using gas @-@ lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives . The Metropolitan Railway operated all services until the District introduced its own trains in 1871 . The railway was soon extended westwards through Earl 's Court to Fulham , Richmond , Ealing and Hounslow . After completing the inner circle and reaching Whitechapel in 1884 , it was extended to Upminster in Essex in 1902 . 
 To finance electrification at the beginning of the 20th century , American financier Charles Yerkes took it over and made it part of his Underground Electric Railways Company of London ( UERL ) group . Electric propulsion was introduced in 1905 , and by the end of the year electric multiple units operated all of the services . On 1 July 1933 , the District Railway and the other UERL railways were merged with the Metropolitan Railway and the capital 's tramway and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board . 
 Today , former District Railway tracks and stations are used by the London Underground 's District , Piccadilly and Circle lines .

 In 1863 , the Metropolitan Railway ( also known as the Met ) opened the world 's first underground railway . The line was built from Paddington beneath the New Road , connecting the main line railway termini at Paddington , Euston and King 's Cross . Then it followed Farringdon Road to a station at Farringdon Street in Smithfield , near the capital 's financial heart in the City . 
 The Met 's early success prompted a flurry of applications to parliament in 1863 for new railways in London , many competing for similar routes . The House of Lords established a select committee that recommended an " inner circuit of railway that should abut , if not actually join , nearly all of the principal railway termini in the Metropolis " . For the 1864 parliamentary session , railway schemes were presented that met the recommendation in varying ways and a joint committee composed of members of both Houses of Parliament reviewed the options . 
 Proposals to extend west and then south from Paddington to South Kensington and east from Moorgate to Tower Hill were accepted and received Royal Assent on 29 July 1864 . To complete the circuit , the committee encouraged the amalgamation of two schemes proposed to run via different routes between Kensington and the City and a combined proposal under the name Metropolitan District Railway was agreed on the same day . Initially , the District and the Met were closely associated and it was intended that they would soon merge . The Met 's chairman and three other directors were on the board of the District , John Fowler was the engineer of both companies and the construction works for all of the extensions were let as a single contract . The District was established as a separate company to enable funds to be raised independently of the Met . 
 Unlike the railway the Metropolitan had opened in 1863 , the route did not follow an easy alignment under existing roads and land values were higher , so compensation payments for property were much higher . To ensure ventilation , the line west of Gloucester Road was carried in open cuttings , the rest mainly in a cut and cover tunnel 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) wide and 15 feet 9 inches ( 4 @.@ 80 m ) deep ; at the stations the platform ends were left open . Construction costs and compensation payments were so high that the cost of the first section of the District from South Kensington to Westminster was £ 3 million , almost three times the cost of the Met 's original , longer line . On 24 December 1868 , the District opened its line from South Kensington to Westminster , with stations at South Kensington , Sloane Square , Victoria , St. James 's Park and Westminster Bridge ( now Westminster ) , the Met extending eastwards from Brompton to a shared station at South Kensington on the same day . 
 The District also had parliamentary permission to extend westward from Brompton ( Gloucester Road ) station and , on 12 April 1869 , it opened a single track line from there to West Brompton on the West London Railway . There were no intermediate stations and this service initially operated as a shuttle . By summer 1869 additional tracks had been laid between South Kensington to Brompton ( Gloucester Road ) and from Kensington ( High Street ) to a junction with the line to West Brompton . During the night of 5 July 1870 the District secretly built the disputed Cromwell curve connecting Brompton ( Gloucester Road ) and Kensington ( High Street ) . East of Westminster , the next section ran in the newly constructed Victoria Embankment built by the Metropolitan Board of Works along the north bank of the River Thames . The line was opened from Westminster to Blackfriars on 30 May 1870 with stations at Charing Cross ( now Embankment ) , The Temple ( now Temple ) and Blackfriars . 
 The Met initially operated all services , receiving 55 per cent of the gross receipts for a fixed level of service . The District were also charged for any extra trains and the District 's share of the income dropped to about 40 per cent . The District 's level of debt meant that merger was no longer attractive to the Met and its directors resigned from the District 's board . To improve its finances , the District gave the Met notice to terminate the operating agreement . Struggling under the burden of high construction costs , the District was unable to continue with the original scheme to reach Tower Hill and made a final extension of its line one station further east from Blackfriars to a previously unplanned City terminus at Mansion House . 
 On Saturday 1 July 1871 , an opening banquet was attended by the Prime Minister William Gladstone , who was also a shareholder . The following Monday , Mansion House opened and the District began running its own trains . From this date , the two companies operated a joint inner circle service between Mansion House and Moorgate Street via South Kensington and Edgware Road that ran every ten minutes . This was supplemented by a District service every ten minutes between Mansion House and West Brompton , and Hammersmith & City Railway and Great Western Railway ( GWR ) suburban services between Edgware Road and Moorgate Street . The permissions for the railway east of Mansion House were allowed to lapse . At the other end of the line , the District part of South Kensington station opened on 10 July 1871 and Earl 's Court station opened on the West Brompton extension on 30 October 1871 .

 The District Railway 's main expansion was to the west . A small station at Earl 's Court , between Gloucester Road and West Brompton , opened on 31 October 1871 with three platforms . Lillie Bridge depot , opened in 1872 , was built parallel to the West London Joint Railway and initially accessed by a curve onto the West London Line . This curve allowed , from 1 February 1872 , the London & North Western Railway ( L & NWR ) to run a half @-@ hourly outer circle service from Broad Street to Mansion House via Willesden Junction , Addison Road and Earls Court . From 1 October 1872 , the GWR also ran a half @-@ hourly middle circle service from the Met 's Moorgate Street station to Mansion House via Paddington and Earl 's Court . 
 Permission to build a railway 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) long to Hammersmith was granted on 7 July 1873 the independent Hammersmith Extension Railway having been formed to raise the necessary capital . The new line started from a junction on the curve to Addison Road and also allowed easier access to Lillie Bridge depot . It opened on 9 September 1874 with one intermediate station at North End ( Fulham ) ( renamed West Kensington in 1877 ) and a terminus at Hammersmith , and was served by through trains to Mansion House . West Brompton was now served by a shuttle to Earl 's Court . Earl 's Court station burnt down in 1875 and a larger replacement with four tracks and two island platforms opened on 1 February 1878 . This was sited to the west of the original station ; to the east of the station a flying junction was built to separate traffic to Kensington ( High Street ) and from Gloucester Road . 
 In December 1876 , six trains per hour ran on the inner circle between Mansion House and Aldgate . The District operated four trains per hour from Mansion House to Hammersmith . Also leaving every hour from Mansion House were two GWR middle circle services to Aldgate via Addison Road and two L & NWR services to Broad Street via Willesden Junction . Three services an hour travelled between West Brompton and Earl 's Court . 
 In 1864 the London and South Western Railway ( L & SWR ) had obtained permission for a railway to serve Richmond . The route headed north from Addison Road on the West London Railway before curving round to serve Hammersmith at a station at Hammersmith ( Grove Road ) ( linked to the Hammersmith & City Railway station by footbridge ) , Turnham Green , Brentford Road ( Gunnersbury from 1871 ) and Kew Gardens and Richmond . The line opened on 1 January 1869 , the L & SWR running services from Waterloo and Ludgate Hill via Addison Road , and the L & NWR running services from Broad Street to Richmond from a link at Brentford Road to the North London Line at South Action . Stations opened on the line at Shaftesbury Road ( Ravenscourt Park from 1888 ) and Shepherds Bush on 1 May 1874 . 
 In 1875 permission was given for a 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) link from the District station at Hammersmith to a junction just east of Ravenscourt Park . As the L & SWR line was on a viaduct and the District line in a cutting , the line rose steeply . On 1 June 1877 , the Hammersmith branch was extended to Richmond , initially with a service of one train an hour to Mansion House . The Met and GWR Hammersmith & City line had access by a link just north of their Hammersmith station and diverted a service to Richmond from 1 October 1877 . 
 From 1 May 1878 to 30 September 1880 , the Midland Railway operated a circular service from St Pancras to Earl 's Court via <unk> Hill , Acton and the L & SWR to Hammersmith . In 1879 the District opened a junction west of L & SWR 's Turnham Green station for a 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) line to Ealing . With stations at Acton Green ( now Chiswick Park ) , Mill Hill Park ( now Acton Town ) , Ealing Common and Ealing Broadway , the Ealing station was built just north of the GWR station . On 4 July 1878 , permission was granted to extend the West Brompton branch as far as the Thames . Stations opened at Walham Green ( now Fulham Broadway ) , Parsons Green . The line terminated at Putney Bridge & Fulham ( now Putney Bridge ) . The line opened on 1 March 1880 , in time for the University Boat Race held that year on 22 March . Initially the service was two trains an hour to Mansion House , supplemented from 1 April by two trains an hour to High Street Kensington . 
 In 1866 , permission had been granted to landowners in the Hounslow area for a Hounslow and Metropolitan Railway to connect to a proposed Acton & Brentford Railway . However , this had never been built , but with the District now at Acton there was an alternative . Permission was granted in 1880 for a nearly 5 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) railway from Mill Hill Park station to Hounslow Barracks , with stations at South Ealing , Boston Road and Spring Grove , and agreement reached for the District to work the line . On 1 May 1883 the District started a service to Hounslow Town , calling at South Ealing , Boston Road ( now Boston Manor ) and Osterley & Spring Grove ( now Osterley ) . A single @-@ track line from junction near Hounslow Town to Hounslow Barracks ( now Hounslow West ) opened a year later in 1884 . Traffic was light and Hounslow Barracks was initially served by a shuttle to Osterley & Spring Grove that connected to an off @-@ peak Hounslow Town to Mill Hill Park train . Hounslow Town station closed in 1886 and Heston Hounslow station ( now Hounslow Central ) opened . 
 From 1 March 1883 to 30 September 1885 , via a connection to the GWR tracks at Ealing , the District ran a service to Windsor .

 Conflict between the Met and the District and the expense of construction delayed the completion of the inner circle . In 1874 , frustrated City financiers formed the Metropolitan Inner Circle Completion Railway Company with the aim of finishing the route . The company was supported by the District railway and obtained parliamentary authority on 7 August 1874 , but struggled with funding . The time allowed was extended in 1876 . A meeting between the District and Metropolitan was held in 1877 , the Met now wishing to access the South Eastern Railway ( SER ) via the East London Railway ( ELR ) . Both companies promoted and obtained an Act of Parliament in 1879 for the extension and a link to the ELR . The Act also ensured future co @-@ operation by allowing both companies access to the whole circle . A large contribution was made by authorities for road and sewer improvements . In 1882 the Met extended its line from Aldgate to a temporary station at Tower of London . Two contracts to build joint lines were placed , one from Mansion House to the Tower in 1882 and a second from the circle north of Aldgate to Whitechapel with a curve onto the ELR in 1883 . From 1 October 1884 the District and Metropolitan began local services from St Mary 's via this curve onto the East London Railway to SER 's New Cross station . After an official opening ceremony on 17 September and trial running , a circular service started on Monday 6 October 1884 . On the same day the District extended its services to Whitechapel and over the ELR to New Cross , calling at new joint stations at Aldgate East and St Mary 's . Joint stations opened on the circle line at Cannon Street , Eastcheap ( Monument from 1 November 1884 ) and Mark Lane . The Met 's Tower of London station closed on 12 October 1884 after the District refused to sell tickets to the station . After opening the District service from New Cross four trains an hour ran alternately to Hammersmith or Putney , but as passenger demand was low after a month this was reduced to two trains an hour to Ealing . Four trains an hour went from Whitechapel , two to Putney , one to Hammersmith and one to Richmond . The middle and outer circle services continued operating from Mansion House at two per hour each . Initially the inner circle service was eight trains an hour , completing the 13 miles ( 21 kilometres ) circuit in 81 – 84 minutes , but this proved impossible to maintain and service was reduced to six trains an hour with a 70 @-@ minute timing in 1885 . Initially guards were permitted no relief breaks during their shift until September 1885 when they were permitted three 20 @-@ minute breaks . 
 = = = = South to Richmond and east to East Ham = = = = 
 Several schemes to cross the Thames at Putney Bridge to Guildford , Surbiton or Wimbledon had been proposed and received approval from Parliament , although the District had been unable to raise the necessary funding . In 1886 the L & SWR replaced these plans with the Wimbledon and Fulham Railway that started on the west side of Wimbledon and crossing Thames to meet the District 's Putney Bridge station . The line had intermediate stations at Wimbledon Park , Southfields and East Putney and a junction connected the line to the L & SWR 's Waterloo to Reading Line just north of East Putney station . The District had running rights and extended some Putney services to Wimbledon on 3 June 1889 . 
 In 1897 the nominally independent Whitechapel & Bow Railway received permission for a link from the District Railway at Whitechapel to the London , Tilbury and Southend Railway ( LT & SR ) at an above @-@ ground junction at Bow , to the west of Bromley station . The LT & SR and District jointly took over the company the following year and the line opened on 2 June 1902 with new stations at Stepney Green , Mile End and Bow Road . Some District services were extended from Whitechapel to East Ham and one train each morning and evening ran through to Upminster . In July 1902 four trains an hour ran from Bow Road ( 2 to 3 from East Ham ) to Ealing or Wimbledon and two trains an hour from New Cross served Hammersmith or Richmond . The outer circle continued to run from Mansion House , the GWR 's middle circle having started at Earl 's Court from 1900 . 
 The District sought to serve Harrow and Uxbridge and in 1892 a route from Ealing to <unk> ( South Harrow ) was surveyed and a bill presented in the name of the nominally independent Ealing and South Harrow Railway ( E & <unk> ) . Construction started in 1897 and by the end of 1899 it was largely complete , but with low traffic prospects remained unopened . To reach Uxbridge a line from South Harrow via Ruislip was authorised in 1897 . The District had problems raising the finance and the Metropolitan offered a rescue package whereby they would build a branch from Harrow to Rayners Lane and take over the line to Uxbridge , with the District retaining running rights for up to three trains an hour . The Metropolitan built the railway to Uxbridge and began running services on 4 July 1904 .

 = = = = Development = = = = 
 At the start of the 20th century the District and Metropolitan railways faced increased competition in central London from new , electric , deep @-@ level tube lines . The City & South London Railway had been a great success when it opened in 1890 . After the opening of the Central London Railway in 1900 from Shepherd 's Bush to the City with a flat rate fare of 2d , the District and Metropolitan together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900 . The use of steam propulsion led to smoke @-@ filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward . However , electric traction was still in its infancy and agreement would be needed with the Metropolitan because of the shared ownership of the inner circle . A jointly owned train of six coaches successfully ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl 's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900 . Tenders were then requested and in 1901 a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three @-@ phase AC system with overhead wires . Initially this was accepted by both parties . 
 The District found an investor to finance the upgrade in 1901 , American Charles Yerkes . On 15 July 1901 , Yerkes established the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company with himself as managing director and raised £ 1 million to carry out the electrification , including construction of the generating station and supplying the new rolling stock . Yerkes soon had control of the District Railway and his experiences in the United States led him to favour DC with a track level conductor rail similar to that in use on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway . After arbitration by the Board of Trade , the DC system was adopted . 
 The District had permission for a deep @-@ level tube beneath the sub @-@ surface line between Earl 's Court and Mansion House and in 1898 bought the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway with authority for a tube from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus . These plans were combined with those of the Great Northern and Strand Railway , a tube railway with permission to build a line from Strand to Wood Green , to create the Great Northern , Piccadilly and Brompton Railway ( GNP & BR ) . The section of the District 's deep @-@ level tube from South Kensington to Mansion house was dropped from plans . In April 1902 , the Underground Electric Railways Company of London ( UERL ) was established , with Yerkes as chairman , to control these companies and manage the planned works . On 8 June 1902 , the UERL took over the Traction Company and paid off the company 's shareholders with cash and UERL shares . 
 The UERL built a large power station that would be capable of providing power for the District lines and the underground lines planned . Work began in 1902 at Lots Road , by Chelsea Creek and in February 1905 Lots Road Power Station began generating electricity at 11 kV 33 1 ⁄ 3 Hz , conveyed by high voltage cables to substations that converted this to approximately <unk> DC . 
 While the power station was being built , the District electrified the Ealing to Harrow line that was not yet open . It was equipped with automatic signalling using track circuits and pneumatic semaphore signals , and trials were run with two seven car trains . In August 1903 , an order was placed for 420 cars and a new maintenance depot was built west of Mill Hill Park ( now Acton Town ) . 
 After the trials , the line to South Harrow opened in June 1903 , from 23 June with a shuttle to Park Royal & Twyford Abbey ( now Park Royal ) for that year 's Royal Agricultural Show . The rest of the line to South Harrow opened the following week on 28 June , with stations at North Ealing , Park Royal & Twyford Abbey , <unk> @-@ Alperton ( now Alperton ) , Sudbury Town , Sudbury Hill and South Harrow . 
 = = = = Electric services = = = = 
 Electric services began on 13 June 1905 between Hounslow and South Acton , using the line from Mill Hill Park to South Acton for a passenger service for the first time . Hounslow Town station was reopened , trains reversing at the station before continuing to Hounslow Barracks using a new single track curve . On 1 July 1905 electric trains began running from Ealing to Whitechapel , and on the same day the Metropolitan and District railways both introduced electric units on the inner circle . However , a Metropolitan multiple unit overturned the positive current rail on the District Railway , and investigation showed an incompatibility between the way the shoe @-@ gear was mounted on the Met trains and the District Railway track , and the Met trains were withdrawn from the District lines . After modification the Met returned and electric trains took over on 24 September , reducing the travel time around the circle from seventy to fifty minutes . By September , after withdrawing services over the unelectrified East London Line and the LT & SR east of East Ham , the District were running electric services on all remaining routes . From December 1905 the L & NWR service was hauled by electric locomotives from Mansion House to Earl 's Court , where a L & NWR steam locomotive took over . 
 In 1907 the weekday off @-@ peak service was four trains per hour from East Ham to Ealing Broadway , four per hour from Mansion House to alternately Richmond and Wimbledon and two per hour from Wimbledon to High Street Kensington and Ealing Broadway to Whitechapel . Four trains per hour ran from Putney Bridge to Earl 's Court , two continuing to High Street Kensington . From South Harrow there were two trains per hour to Mill Hill Park , and four trains per hour from Hounslow Barracks to Mill Hill Park , two of these continuing to South Acton . 
 Meanwhile , the UERL 's GNP & BR tube railway was under construction , surfacing west of West Kensington and entering two terminal platforms on the north side of the District 's Hammersmith station . A new station , Barons Court , was built with two island platforms , one for each railway . As there was space at Lillie Bridge Depot after the District had moved to Mill Hill Park , the GNP & BR took over part of the site for its depot . Barons Court opened 9 October 1905 and the tube railway opened as the Piccadilly line on 15 December 1906 .

 In 1908 the UERL and the other underground railway companies in London came to a joint marketing arrangement that included maps , joint publicity and combined ticketing . UNDERGROUND signs were used outside stations in Central London . The UERL eventually controlled all underground railways in London except the Waterloo & City Railway , the Metropolitan Railway and its subsidiary the Great Northern & City Railway , and introduced station name boards with a red disc and a blue bar . 
 <unk> @-@ stop ' working was introduced on the District in December 1907 . Usually just a few stations were missed ; trains were marked NON STOP or ALL <unk> as appropriate and panels beside the doors listed the stations the train would skip . East of Bow Road station the District shared the tracks with LT & SR steam engines and widening the railway to East Ham was considered essential . Four tracks were laid and two electrified as far as Barking , where the Tilbury and Upminster routes separated . On 1 April 1908 District trains were extended through to Barking and the work was largely finished in July 1908 . After 2 May 1909 trains no longer reversed at Hounslow Town after the station was closed and a new Hounslow Town station opened on the direct route . 
 Since 1904 , after the District had notified the Met that it would not use its running rights on the Uxbridge line with steam trains , it had not run services , although it paid the £ 2 @,@ 000 a year that was due under the enabling Act . When the District suggested running as far as Rayners Lane , the Met responded with a proposal to rebuild the station as a District terminus . The District proposed running trains through to Uxbridge , leading to negotiations about the charges for traction current before District services were extended to Uxbridge on 1 March 1910 . In 1910 a platform was built at Mill Hill Park for the Hounslow and Uxbridge shuttles and a flying junction built north of the station to separate the Ealing and Hounslow traffic . The station was renamed Acton Town on 1 March 1910 . 
 Between Turnham Green and Ravenscourt Park the District shared tracks with L & SWR steam trains to Richmond , a GWR steam service from Richmond to Ladbroke Grove and Midland coal trains . The District and L & SWR agreed to quadruple the tracks to allow a pair for the District 's sole use and build a station on the District tracks at Stamford Brook . The line was first used on 3 December 1911 and Stamford Brook opened on 1 February 1912 . However , the GWR had already withdrawn their service and L & SWR was to withdraw in 1916 . A flying junction separating the Richmond and Hammersmith routes west of Earl 's Court opened in January 1914 . 
 From 1910 the LT & SR ran through trains from Ealing Broadway to Southend or Shoeburyness , hauled to Barking by the District 's electric locomotives that were no longer needed for the L & NWR 's outer circle service , then pulled by steam locomotive . From 1912 two specially built sets of saloon coaches with retention toilets were used . In the 1920s the off @-@ peak weekday service was a train every ten minutes from Wimbledon and Ealing and every fifteen minutes from Richmond . Six trains per hour ran from Putney Bridge to High Street Kensington . Trains from Hounslow left every 6 – 8 minutes , terminating at Acton Town or South Acton . Six trains per hour left Hammersmith for South Harrow , three continuing to Uxbridge . In 1925 the inner circle service was ten trains per hour in each direction , but this frequency of service caused problems . A reduction to eight would leave the Kensington High Street to Edgware Road section with too few trains . However the Metropolitan had recently rebuilt it with four platforms as part of an abandoned plan for a tube to Kilburn . The District extended its Putney to High Street service to Edgware Road and the Metropolitan provided all inner circle trains at a frequency of eight trains per hour . 
 In 1923 the London , Midland and Scottish Railway had inherited the LT & SR line to Barking , and in 1929 proposed quadrupling the line to Upminster and electrifying one pair of tracks for use by the District . On 12 September 1932 services started with new stations at <unk> and <unk> ( now Dagenham <unk> ) with platforms only on the District tracks . 
 = = = = Piccadilly line extension = = = = 
 In November 1912 a bill was published that included a plan to extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from Hammersmith to connect to the L & SWR 's Richmond branch tracks . The bill passed as the London Electric Railway Act , 1913 on 15 August 1913 , although the advent of World War I prevented work on the extension . 
 Powers were renewed in 1926 for four tracks from Hammersmith to west of Acton Town , with the concept of the Piccadilly running non @-@ stop on the inner pair . The proposed service split , with the Piccadilly running through to Harrow and Hounslow , was clarified by 1929 . District services would run mainly through to Wimbledon , Richmond , Hounslow and Ealing , with shuttles from South Harrow to Uxbridge and Acton Town to South Acton . 
 With finance guaranteed by the Development ( Loan Guarantees and Grants ) Act of 1929 , construction started in 1930 . Four tracks were built from Studland Road junction to Northfields on the Hounslow branch . At the junction at Turnham Green for Richmond eastbound freight loops were built for coal trains to Kensington . Acton Town was rebuilt with five platforms , and a depot was built west of Northfields station . 
 Several stations were rebuilt in a Modernist style influenced or designed by Charles Holden , who was inspired by examples of Modernist architecture in mainland Europe . This influence can be seen in the bold vertical and horizontal forms , which were combined with the use of traditional materials like brick . Holden called them ' brick boxes with concrete lids ' . Today , several of these Holden @-@ designed stations are listed buildings , including the prototype Sudbury Town listed as Grade II * . 
 On 4 July 1932 the District service from Acton Town to South Harrow was withdrawn and one in three Piccadilly trains extended from Hammersmith to South Harrow , the District continuing to run a shuttle from South Harrow to Uxbridge . On 18 December 1932 all four tracks to Northfields opened and from 9 January 1933 Piccadilly trains started to run to Northfields , continuing to Hounslow West from 13 March 1933 . District trains continued to run through to Hounslow off @-@ peak , with a shuttle from South Acton . 
 = = = London Passenger Transport Board , 1933 = = = 
 The UERL 's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company ( LGOC ) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group , through the pooling of revenues , to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways . However , competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the group . 
 To protect the UERL group 's income , its chairman Lord Ashfield lobbied the government for regulation of transport services in the London area . Starting in 1923 , a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction , with Ashfield and Labour London County Councillor ( later MP and Minister of Transport ) Herbert Morrison , at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought . Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take control of the LCC 's tram system ; Morrison preferred full public ownership . After seven years of false starts , a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board ( LPTB ) , a public corporation that would take control of the UERL , the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area . The Board was a compromise – public ownership but not full nationalisation – and came into existence on 1 July 1933 . On this date , ownership of the assets of the District and the other Underground companies transferred to the LPTB . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 The railway became the District line of London Transport . From 23 October 1933 a Piccadilly line service replaced the Harrow to Uxbridge District shuttle . In 1923 the London , Midland and Scottish Railway ( LMS ) had taken over the L & NWR railway 's outer circle service from Earl 's Court and by the Second World War this had been cut back to an electrified Earl 's Court to Willesden Junction shuttle . Following bombing of the West London Line in 1940 the LMS and the Metropolitan line services to Addison Road were both suspended . After the war , to serve the Kensington exhibition halls a District line shuttle service started from Earl 's Court to Addison Road , now renamed Kensington Olympia . 
 The off @-@ peak District Hounslow branch shuttle to South Acton was discontinued on 29 April 1935 and replaced by an Acton Town to South Acton shuttle . This shuttle was withdrawn on 28 February 1959 , and the peak hour District line through service to Hounslow was withdrawn on 9 October 1964 . In the 1970s the Hounslow branch became the Heathrow branch when it was extended to serve Heathrow Airport , first on 19 July 1975 to serve Hatton Cross and then on 16 December 1977 when Heathrow Central opened .

 When in 1871 the District Railway needed its own locomotives , they ordered twenty four condensing steam locomotives from Beyer Peacock similar to the A Class locomotives the Metropolitan Railway was using on the route . As they were intended for an underground railway , the locomotives did not have cabs , but had a weatherboard with a bent @-@ back top . The back plate of the bunker was raised to provide protection when running bunker first . A total of fifty four locomotives were purchased . They were still in service in 1905 when the line was electrified , and all but six were sold the following year . 
 = = = Electric locomotives = = = 
 In 1905 the District bought ten bogie box cab locomotives that looked similar to their multiple units but were only 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) long . They were manufactured by the Metropolitan Amalgamated Carriage and Wagon Company and most had a single cab at one end . Consequently , they were operated in pairs , coupled back to back with the cabs at the outer end . 
 The locomotives were used to haul L & NWR passenger trains on the electrified section of the Outer Circle route between Earl 's Court and Mansion House . After December 1908 these services terminated at Earl 's Court . The locomotives were used to haul District trains , one coupled to each end of a rake of four trailer cars . From 1910 the locomotives were used on London , Tilbury and Southend Railway ( LT & SR ) trains extended over the District line , taking over from steam locomotives at Barking . 
 = = = Carriages = = = 
 The steam carriages were four wheeled , 29 feet 2 inches ( 8 @.@ 89 m ) long over the buffers . First , second and third class compartments were available . First class carriages had four compartments , the others five . Lighting was initially provided by burning coal gas held in bags on the roof , later by a pressurised oil gas system . At first they were fitted with a chain brake . This was replaced by the simple Westinghouse brake and then a fully automatic Westinghouse brake . 
 Initially trains were made up of eight carriages , but after 1879 nine became the standard . At the end of 1905 the District replaced 395 carriages with electric multiple units . A preserved carriage at the Kent and East Sussex Railway was thought to be a District Railway first class , but now thought likely to be a <unk> Metropolitan Railway eight wheeler . 
 = = = Electric multiple units = = = 
 In 1903 the District tested two seven @-@ car trains with different control and brake systems on its unopened line between Ealing and South Harrow . Access to the car was by platforms with lattice gates at their ends and hand operated sliding doors on the car sides . Later some trailer cars were fitted with driving controls and two and three car trains operated from Mill Hill Park to Hounslow and South Harrow and later Uxbridge until they were withdrawn in 1925 . 
 The District Railway ordered 60 x 7 @-@ car electric trains in 1903 . A third of the vehicles were made in England , the rest in Belgium and France and electrical equipment was installed on arrival at Ealing Common Works . Access was by sliding doors , double doors in the centre and single doors at either end . First and third class accommodation were provided in open saloons with electric lighting . The seats were covered with rattan in third class and plush in first . From 1906 the standard formation was six cars , with an equal number of motor and trailer cars running in either two or four car formations off @-@ peak . By 1910 the District required additional rolling stock and ordered cars largely constructed of steel . The first batch arrived in 1911 , followed by more in 1912 from a different manufacturer but to a similar design . Further cars arrived in 1914 with an elliptical roof instead of the clerestory roof on the earlier designs . In 1920 the District took delivery of new cars , incompatible with the existing fleet , with three hand @-@ operated double sliding doors on each side . 
 In 1923 fifty motor car bodies were ordered to allow some of the original 1904 – 05 car bodies to be scrapped . From 1926 two stock pools were created . Main line trains were formed from 101 new motor cars supplemented by motor cars rebuilt from the steel bodied cars originally constructed in 1910 – 14 and 1923 , and trailers modified from the original wooden bodied cars . A small pool of unmodified ' local stock ' worked the shuttles from Acton Town to South Acton , South Harrow and Hounslow . 
 In 1932 the line to Upminster was electrified and new vehicles were purchased . After the District Railway became part of London Underground , similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking and replace some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers . The 1935 – 40 New Works Programme fitted electro @-@ pneumatic brakes and air @-@ operated doors to most of the District line stock and allowed the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped . A number of motor cars were not suitable for conversion and so some trains retained their hand @-@ worked doors and these ran until 1957 . 
 As of March 2015 a driving motor car built in 1923 is a static exhibit at London Transport Museum at Covent Garden .

 The Göttingen Seven ( German : <unk> Sieben ) were a group of seven professors from Göttingen . In 1837 , they protested against the abolition or alteration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Hanover by Ernest Augustus and refused to swear an oath to the new king of Hanover . The company of seven was led by Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann , who himself was one of the key advocates of the unadulterated constitution . The other six were the Germanist brothers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm ( famed fairy tale and folk tale writers and storytellers , known together as the Brothers Grimm ) , jurist Wilhelm Eduard Albrecht , historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus , physicist Wilhelm Eduard Weber , and theologian and orientalist Heinrich Georg August Ewald .

 The constitution that Ernst Augustus opposed came into effect in 1833 , while the King was still heir presumptive to the Hanoverian throne . Historian and politician Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann contested Ernest Augustus ' plans to change the constitution to his liking , as Dahlman himself had contributed to the constitution 's framing . Additionally , Dahlmann existed as the representative of the University of Göttingen , in the second chamber of the noble court . 
 The death of King William IV on June 20 , 1837 had a great impact on Hanover 's political positioning , relations , and union with the group of constitutional states in the German Confederation . With William 's death , the personal union ended between Hanover and the United Kingdom , and William 's brother ( Ernest Augustus ) took over as ruler of the kingdom of Hanover . Augustus ' niece Victoria acceded to the throne of the United Kingdom , but could not inherit Hanover due to the provision of Salic Law in force in Hanover , which barred females from ruling . 
 About one month after he succeeded to the throne , King Ernest addressed the matter of the Constitution . He stated that he was not bound by it , as his consent had not been asked to it . He also indicated that it would have been different , or perhaps even non @-@ existent , had he been in power at the time of its composition . He declared that it was his aim and ambition to make the necessary changes to the constitution and rewrite it to reflect his values . 
 Hearing this , Dahlmann made an attempt to persuade his colleagues at the University of Göttingen senate to disapprove of the king 's intent to change the constitution , and take some form of action . None of his over 40 different colleagues were willing to support Dahlmann 's view and possibly cause public conflict or unrest during ongoing festivities of the 100th anniversary of the Georg @-@ August University of Göttingen . 
 = = Protest and aftermath = = 
 On November 1 of the same year , Ernest Augustus annulled the constitution . This move was met with political criticism from some German states . The move also provoked Dahlmann to again appeal to the university and to compose a protestation opposing Augustus ' decision . This time , he received a better response : six other professors were now willing to sign as opposers . These six plus Dahlmann became known as the Göttingen Seven . Dahlmann 's document was published on November 18 and it met with an explosive influence — the students at the university produced many hundreds or even thousands of copies and disseminated them across Germany . 
 The protest 's impact forced the king to take action , and the seven defiant professors were questioned before the university court on December 4 . Ten days later , the seven were relieved of their posts at the university , and three of them ( Dahlmann , Jacob Grimm , and Gervinus ) were given three days to leave the country . The university viewed the dismissal as a great loss to the university , confirmed in writings about the event during the time . 
 The direct effects of the protest were limited , but public sensation and media interest was high in Germany and much of Europe , and the seven were popular among the general public . Each of the seven had his own personal reasons for defying the king , but the fact that they had done so was the central catalyst for the media and public attention . The efforts of the Göttingen Seven outlived each of them , and the creation of a liberal republic in Germany can in part be traced back to their protest .

 = Operation Bodenplatte = 
 Operation Bodenplatte ( <unk> ) , launched on 1 January 1945 , was an attempt by the Luftwaffe to cripple Allied air forces in the Low Countries during the Second World War . The goal of Bodenplatte was to gain air superiority during the stagnant stage of the Battle of the Bulge so that the German Army and Waffen @-@ SS forces could resume their advance . The operation was planned for 16 December 1944 , but was delayed repeatedly due to bad weather until New Year ’ s Day , the first day that happened to be suitable . 
 Secrecy for the operation was so tight that not all German ground and naval forces had been informed of the operation and some units suffered casualties from friendly fire . British signals intelligence ( Ultra ) recorded the movement and buildup of German air forces in the region , but did not realise that an operation was imminent . 
 The operation achieved some surprise and tactical success , but was ultimately a failure . A great many Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground but replaced within a week . Allied aircrew casualties were quite small , since the majority of Allied losses were empty planes sitting on the ground . The Germans , however , lost many pilots that they could not readily replace . 
 Post @-@ battle analysis suggests only 11 of the Luftwaffe 's 34 air combat Gruppen made attacks on time and with surprise . The operation failed to achieve air superiority , even temporarily , while the German ground forces continued to be exposed to Allied air attack . Bodenplatte was the last large @-@ scale strategic offensive operation mounted by the Luftwaffe during the war . 
 = = Background = = 
 The armies of the Western Allies were supported by the Allied Air Forces as they advanced across Western Europe in 1944 . The Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and its Second Tactical Air Force — under the command of Air Marshal Arthur Coningham — moved No. 2 Group RAF , No. 83 Group RAF , No. 84 Group RAF and No. 85 Group RAF to continental Europe in order to provide constant close air support . The RAF harassed the German air , sea and ground forces by hitting strong points and interdicting their supply lines while reconnaissance units apprised the Allies of German movements . With Allied air superiority , the German Army could not operate effectively . The Luftwaffe , however , found it difficult to provide effective air cover for the German Army . Although German aircraft production peaked in 1944 the Luftwaffe was critically short of pilots and fuel , and lacked experienced combat leaders . 
 The land battles moved towards the River Rhine , to the east of which lay the German heartland . Most of France had been liberated , as had the Belgian cities Brussels and Antwerp . Although Operation Market Garden had failed in 1944 , by 1945 the Allies had overrun most of the southern Netherlands and the Scheldt Estuary . As the ground forces moved across Europe , the Allied tactical air forces moved into new bases on the continent , to continue providing close support . The only limiting factor for the Allies was the weather . As winter came , the rains and mud turned airfields into quagmires , so large @-@ scale air and land operations came to a halt . 
 The situation might well have continued until the spring thaw had the German High Command ( Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ) not launched Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein ( Operation Watch on the Rhine ) on 16 December 1944 . The land offensive was to improve the German military position by capturing Antwerp and separating the British Army from United States Army forces . Part of the planning for the German land operation required the attack to be conducted under the cover of bad winter weather , which kept the main Allied asset , the Tactical Air Forces , on the ground . It initially succeeded , but the weather also grounded the Luftwaffe for the most part . Nevertheless , the Luftwaffe did manage to put 500 aircraft into the air on 16 December , more than had been achieved for a long time . This first day had been the originally planned date for the strike against Allied airfields , named Operation Bodenplatte . However , the weather proved particularly bad and operations were shut down . 
 The offensive achieved surprise and much initial success . To counter the attack from the air , the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) handed operational control of its XXIX Tactical Air Command and part of its Ninth Air Force , under the command of Major General Hoyt Vandenberg , to the RAF and Arthur Coningham . On 23 December , the RAF Second Tactical Air Force provided the American forces with much needed support , and helped prevent a German capture of Malmedy and Bastogne . This left the Germans with only the logistical bottleneck of St. Vith to support their operations . The German attack faltered . 
 The Luftwaffe had been far from absent over the front in December . It flew several thousand sorties over the theatre . Its encounters with the RAF and USAAF had meant heavy losses in matériel and pilots . On the eight days of operations between 17 and 27 December 1944 , 644 fighters were lost and 227 damaged . This resulted in 322 pilots killed , 23 captured and 133 wounded . On the three days of operations 23 – 25 December , 363 fighters were destroyed . None of the Geschwaderkommodore ( Wing Commanders ) expected any large @-@ scale air operations by the end of the month . 
 = = Plan = = 
 In September 1944 , Adolf Hitler resolved to recover Germany ′ s deteriorating fortunes by launching an offensive in the West . On 16 September , Hitler directed Generalleutnant Werner <unk> — Chief of the General Staff — to prepare the necessary aircraft for the offensive . On 21 October , <unk> ordered the air fleet defending the Greater German Reich ( Luftflotte Reich ) to hand over seven Jagdgeschwader and Schlachtgeschwader to Air Command West ( <unk> West ) for a future offensive . 
 On 14 November , Hermann Göring — Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Luftwaffe — ordered the 2 . Jagddivision and the 3 . Jagddivision to prepare their units for a large @-@ scale ground attack operation in the Ardennes . Preparations were to be complete by 27 November . The attack was to be carried out on the first day of the offensive . 
 Generalmajor Dietrich Peltz was to plan the operation having been appointed C @-@ in @-@ C of II . Fliegerkorps on 8 December . <unk> West had ordered all units — except Jagdgeschwader 300 and 301 — to attend the main planning meeting in <unk> on 5 December . On 14 December , Peltz officially initiated plans for a major blow against the Allies in northwest Europe . Peltz was not a fighter pilot ; his combat record was as a dive bomber pilot , flying the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka . His experiences in Poland , in France , and during the early campaigns on the Eastern Front had moulded him into an outstanding ground attack specialist , making him an ideal candidate for planning Bodenplatte . 
 On 15 December , this plan was worked out with the help of the Luftwaffe ′ s Jagd @-@ Geschwaderkommodore , among them Gotthard Handrick ( Jagdabschnittsführer <unk> ; Fighter Sector Leader Middle Rhein ) , Walter <unk> and Karl Hentschel , commanders of 3 @.@ and 5 . Jagddivision respectively . It was originally scheduled to support the Battle of the Bulge , the German Army ′ s offensive , which began 16 December 1944 . However , the same bad weather that prevented the RAF and USAAF from supporting their own ground forces also prevented the Luftwaffe from carrying out the operation . It was therefore not launched until 1 January 1945 . By this time , the German Army had lost momentum owing to Allied resistance and clearing weather , which allowed Allied Air Forces to operate . The German Army attempted to restart the attack by launching Operation Northwind ( Unternehmen Nordwind ) . The Luftwaffe was to support this offensive through Bodenplatte . 
 The plan of Bodenplatte called for a surprise attack against 16 Allied air bases in Belgium , the Netherlands and France . The object was to destroy or cripple as many Allied aircraft , hangars and airstrips as possible . Every fighter and fighter @-@ bomber Geschwader ( Wing ) currently occupied with air defence along the Western Front was redeployed . Additional night @-@ fighter units ( Nachtjagdgeschwader ) and medium bomber units ( Kampfgeschwader ) acted as pathfinders . The strike formations themselves were mostly single @-@ engine Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190 fighters . 
 However , in a blunder , the planners had set flight paths that took many units over some of the most heavily defended areas on the continent , namely the V2 launch sites around The Hague . These sites were protected by large numbers of German anti @-@ aircraft artillery ( AAA ) units . At the turn of 1944 / 45 Air Command West had 267 heavy and 277 medium or light AAA batteries , and in addition to this there were 100 Kriegsmarine AAA batteries along the Dutch coast . Most of these lay in the sector of the 16th AAA Division , with its control station at <unk> , 15 mi ( 24 km ) northeast of Arnhem . Some of the AAA units been warned about the air operation but were not kept up to date with developments about changing timetables and the flight plan of German formations . As a result , many of the German fighter units lost aircraft to " friendly fire " before the attacks could be initiated . 
 After five years of war and heavy attrition many of the Luftwaffe 's pilots were inexperienced and poorly trained , deficient in marksmanship and flight skills . There was a shortage of experienced instructors , and many of the training units were forced to fly front @-@ line operations in order to bolster the front @-@ line Jagdgeschwader . Long @-@ range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft . By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained without the possibility of air attack . Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft , and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti @-@ aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high . Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium . 
 The plan called for the units to maintain strict radio silence and secrecy in order to maintain surprise . Maps were also only half complete , identified only enemy installations , and left out flight paths , lest the document fall into Allied hands enabling them to trace the whereabouts of German fighter bases . Most commanders were also refused permission to brief their pilots until moments before take @-@ off . This created operational confusion . Commanders only managed to get across the bare essentials of the plan . When the operation got under way , many German pilots still did not understand what the operation was about , or what exactly was required of them . They were convinced it was just a reconnaissance in force over the front , and were happy to follow their flight leaders on this basis . 
 = = = Targets and order of battle = = = 
 It is unclear whether all of the following were deliberately targeted . Evidence suggests that Grimbergen , <unk> and Ophoven were targeted in error , as was Heesch . In all , the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe ( OKL ) deployed 1 @,@ 035 aircraft from several Jagdgeschwader ( JG — fighter wings ) Kampfgeschwader ( KG — bomber wings ) , <unk> ( NJG — night fighter wings ) and Schlachtgeschwader ( SG — ground attack wings ) ; of these , 38 @.@ 5 % were Bf 109s , 38 @.@ 5 % Fw <unk> , and 23 % Fw <unk> . 
 Below is the German target list : 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Following the Unternehmen Bodenplatte raids , the Allies retrieved several log @-@ books from crashed German aircraft . In several of these , the entry " Auftrag Hermann 1 @.@ 1 . 1945 , Zeit : 9 @.@ 20 Uhr " was translated as " Operation Hermann to commence on 1 January 1945 , at 9 : <unk> . " This led the Allies to believe the operation itself was named Hermann for Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring . Four further different codes were used for the attack : 
 Varus : Indicating that the operation was " a go " and that it would take place within 24 hours of the Varus order being given . 
 <unk> : Authority to brief the pilots and to arrange for the aircraft to be armed and ready at the edge of the airfield . 
 Hermann : Giving the exact date and time of the attack . 
 Dorothea : Indicating a delay in the attack . 
 <unk> : Cancelling of the attack after formations are airborne . 
 = = = Allied intelligence = = = 
 Allied intelligence failed to detect the German intention . In Ultra transcripts , there are only a few indications of what was happening on the other side of the front . On 4 December 1944 , II Jagdkorps had ordered stockpiling for navigational aids , such as " golden @-@ rain " flares and smoke bombs . Allied intelligence made no written observations of this communication . They also disregarded communications to Junkers Ju 88 groups regarding the use of flares when leading formations . Intelligence concluded that these instructions were designed for a ground support mission rather than an interception operation . This was reasonable , but no indications of possible ground targets were given . 
 On 20 December , a 3 . Jagddivision message was intercepted confirming that the locations for emergency landing grounds during a " special undertaking " had remained unchanged . This was a clear indication that something was amiss , but Allied intelligence did not comment on it . It also ignored more messages indicating that low @-@ level attacks were being practised . Allied intelligence , by 16 December , had monitored the reshuffling of both German Army and Luftwaffe formations opposite the American @-@ held front at the Ardennes . Yet nothing major was suspected .

 = = = Maldegem , Ursel and St. Denijs Westrem = = = 
 Jagdgeschwader 1 ( JG 1 ) was responsible for the attack on the Ursel and Maldegem airfields . Oberstleutnant Herbert Ihlefeld led the Geschwader . The formation was mixed ; Stab . , ( headquarters flight or Stabschwarm , attached to every Geschwader ) , I. and II . / JG 1 operated the Fw 190 while the III . / JG 1 flew the Bf 109 . I. / JG 1 lost four of their number to friendly anti @-@ aircraft fire . Three of the four pilots were killed . 
 The attacks at Maldegem and Ursel began at 08 : 30 . Both I and II . / JG 1 became involved in intense dogfights . III . / JG 1 had lost only one aircraft over the target ( and not to enemy fire ) . I. / JG lost a further Fw 190 to friendly anti @-@ aircraft fire as it made its way to Ursel . III . / JG 1 lost at least two further Fw 190s to friendly anti @-@ aircraft fire . Casualties could have been heavier , had the British anti @-@ aircraft defences of Maldegem airfield not been removed in December . 
 <unk> and I. / JG 1 lost 13 Fw 190s and nine pilots were missing ; five were killed and four were captured . Thus the loss rates in personnel and matériel were 39 and 56 % , respectively . III . / JG 1 lost only three Bf 109s with one pilot dead and two captured . I. / JG 1 claimed 30 British Spitfires on the ground and two shot down over Maldegem . At Maldegem , 16 aircraft were destroyed , and at Ursel only six were lost . The claims of I. / JG 1 were actually more in line with British total losses at both Maldegem and Ursel . No. 131 Wing RAF / Polish Wing lost 13 Spitfires plus two damaged beyond repair , a total of 15 lost . At Ursel , six aircraft were destroyed , including , a B @-@ 17 , two Lancasters and a Mosquito . I. and III . / JG 1 lost a total of 16 aircraft and 12 pilots — not a good return . 
 II . / JG 1 attacked the airfield at St. Denis Westrem . Of the 36 II . / JG 1 Fw 190s that took off , 17 were shot down , a staggering 47 % loss rate . Among the pilots lost were several experienced fliers . In exchange , the Germans shot down two Spitfires , and seven forced @-@ landed . At St. Denis 18 Spitfires were destroyed on the ground . 
 Altogether JG 1 lost 25 pilots and 29 aircraft . This return for around 60 enemy aircraft ( 54 on the ground ) cannot be considered a complete success , although the damage at St. Denijs Westrem and Maldegem had been significant . Just nine of the fighters lost by JG 1 are confirmed to have been shot down in combat with Spitfires . It is possible a further three more were shot down by Spitfires , or perhaps ground fire . Two Spitfires were shot down and destroyed , with two more damaged . One pilot of each Squadron ( 308 and 317 ) was killed . The total Spitfire losses were perhaps 32 . 
 = = = Sint @-@ Truiden = = = 
 Schlachtgeschwader 4 and Jagdgeschwader 2 ( SG 4 and JG 2 ) were to strike at Sint @-@ Truiden airfield . JG 2 was commanded by Kurt Bühligen . I. / JG 2 's ground crews managed to make ready 35 of 46 Fw 190s , 29 of which were Fw 190D . Only 33 pilots were fit for operations . So the Gruppe reported only 33 Fw 190s ready . II . / JG 2 could field 20 of 29 Bf 109s . Stab . / JG 2 had three Fw 190s ready for the mission . It is not clear whether Bühligen took part in the mission . III . / JG 2 reported 40 Fw 190s operational , 34 of them Fw <unk> . However , only 28 of the 43 pilots in the unit were fit for operations and the formation fielded only 28 fighters . In total , 84 aircraft were ready on 31 December , including 28 Fw 190D @-@ 9s . 
 SG 4 was led by Alfred Druschel . It had 152 machines on strength , of which just 60 were operational , yet the 129 pilots were fit for action . Stab . / SG 4 had three Fw 190s and two pilots . I. / SG 4 had 21 Fw 190s operational and 27 pilots ready . II . / SG reported 27 Fw 190s ready , but pilot strength is unknown . III . / SG reported 24 Fw 190s , but only 16 were available at the forward airfields . Pilot strength is unknown . Best estimations make it around 60 Fw 190s operational , of which 55 took part . 
 At 09 : 12 , JG 2 crossed the front line at Malmedy and was greeted by an enormous volume of Allied ground fire . The entire area was heavily defended by anti @-@ aircraft artillery , since the area had been the scene of heavy fighting , but also had been attacked by V @-@ 1 and V @-@ 2 missiles . I. / JG 2 lost at least seven fighters to ground fire alone . III . / JG 2 lost 10 fighters . A possible seven Bf 109s from II . / JG 2 were also lost to ground fire . JG 2 attacked Asch and Ophoven airfields by mistake . 
 JG 2 ′ s mission was a disaster . I. / JG 2 lost 18 Fw 190s and six more were damaged by ground fire and enemy aircraft . This represented 73 % of their force . Of the 15 pilots missing , six would survive as POWs . II . / JG 2 lost five Bf 109s and three were damaged a loss rate of 40 % . Pilot losses were three missing , one dead and one wounded . III . / JG 2 lost 19 Fw 190s and three were damaged , a loss rate of 79 % . Nine pilots were killed , two were wounded and four were captured . JG 2 losses , according to another source , amounted to 40 % of its force . Pilot losses were 24 killed or posted missing , 10 captured and four wounded . Another source asserts that pilot losses stood at 23 killed or missing . 
 SG 4 ′ s mission was also a disaster . During the assembly phase , they flew across JG 11 ′ s flight path , and the formation was broken up . Some of the pilots joined JG 11 in the confusion . Unable to recover the formation , I and II . / SG 4 then decided to head home . The Kommodore , Druschel , had continued with five other pilots from III . / SG 4 who had lost contact with their Gruppe . They crossed the front near <unk> around 09 : 10 . As they did so , American anti @-@ aircraft batteries opened fire , claiming seven aircraft in the next 30 minutes . Only six of the 50 Fw 190s of SG 4 carried out an attack , against airfields near Aachen and the Asch aerodrome . Of these six , four did not return . Druschel himself was reported missing . 
 = = = Volkel and Heesch = = = 
 The target of Jagdgeschwader 6 ( JG 6 ) was Volkel . I and III . / JG 6 were to attack while II . / JG 6 was to provide cover against Allied fighters . I. / JG 6 managed to get 29 of its 34 Fw 190s ready , while 25 of II . / JG 6 ′ s fighters took part . Overall , most of the 99 Fw 190s were made available for the operation . III . / JG 6 received orders to target petrol installations on the airfield only . Only 78 Fw 190s took off . 
 While on course , JG 6 approached the airfield of Heesch and some of its pilots assumed it to be Volkel airfield . It is unlikely that the Heesch strip , built in October 1944 , was known to the Luftwaffe . No. 126 Wing RCAF was based there and had dispatched its 411 and 442 Squadrons on recce missions early that morning so the majority of its units were airborne . Its 401 Squadron was readying for takeoff when JG 6 appeared at 09 : 15 . Most of the German pilots had failed to notice the airfield , concentrating on keeping formation at low altitude . 401 Squadron scrambled . Some of the German fighters were authorised to engage , while the main body continued to search for Volkel . Stab . , and II . / JG 6 stumbled on another strip at Helmond , which contained no aircraft . Several German pilots believed it to be Volkel and attacked , losing several of their number to ground fire . II . / JG 6 suffered severely from Spitfire and Tempests based at Helmond . Very little damage was done at Heesch or Helmond . 
 In the event , all four Gruppen failed to find Volkel and its Hawker Tempests remained untouched . The only success JG 6 had was I. / JG ′ s erroneous attack on Eindhoven , which claimed 33 fighters and six medium bombers . Like Volkel , Helmond and Heesch had escaped damage . In the dogfights over Helmond , JG 6 claimed six kills . In fact , only two Spitfires were shot down and one badly damaged . Only one further fighter , a Hawker Typhoon , was shot down . Stab . / JG 6 lost the Kommodore , Kogler , as a POW . Of I. / JG ′ s 29 Fw 190s , seven were lost and two damaged ; of II . / JG 6 ′ s 25 Fw 190s , eight were destroyed and two damaged ; III . / JG 6 lost 12 out 20 Bf 109s . In total , JG 6 lost 43 % of its strength and suffered 16 pilots killed or missing and seven captured . As well as Kogler , one other commanding officer was lost — Gruppenkommandeure Helmut <unk> . Three <unk> were lost : Hauptmann Ewald Trost was captured , Hauptmann Norbert Katz was killed and Lothar Gerlach was posted missing presumed killed .
